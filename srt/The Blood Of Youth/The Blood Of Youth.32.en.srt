[The Blood of Youth]

24
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,970
[Episode 32]

25
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,550
Are you saying

26
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:57,360
that it was one of us

27
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:59,520
who killed Jinyu?

28
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,830
You can't say that.

29
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,600
I'm not Director Zhuoqing's disciple.

30
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,710
I don't know anything about the Art of Detachment.

31
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,590
If you don't believe me,

32
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,200
you can test me out.

33
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,110
But your master is not dead.

34
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,480
He is Zhuoqing's martial brother.

35
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,110
Over years,

36
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,670
you should've learned something from him.

37
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:27,830
Directorate of Incense,

38
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,670
this is a groundless presumption.

39
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,430
As you said,

40
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,920
everyone in the world is suspicious.

41
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,040
It's you, you,

42
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,590
you, you, or you?

43
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:37,200
Shut up!

44
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:38,550
My best friend is dead.

45
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,710
I'll do everything to avenge him!

Jade Deity.

47
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,760
I understand that you're upset.

48
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,430
But you shouldn't have said that.

49
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,760
It was remiss of me.

50
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,590
But I won't take the statement back.

51
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:00,800
What did you say?

52
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,240
His Highness Lord Bai is here.

53
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,240
Your Highness.

54
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:12,700
[In memory of the deceased]

55
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:33,920
Second Master,

56
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,550
I always imagined

57
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,200
what you looked like

58
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,080
all these years.

59
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,480
I imagined

60
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:44,920
that you were

61
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,360
a hermit who stayed on a mountain,

62
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,640
a brilliant scholar who wrote a lot of books.

63
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,040
Unexpectedly,

64
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,240
you are

65
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,430
just like what I saw back then.

66
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:58,590
Second Master,

67
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:01,870
actually, you were boring.

68
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,870
But it'd be a dull world

69
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,430
without a person

70
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,760
like you.

71
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,760
I'm sorry,

72
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,110
Your Highness.

73
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:16,910
I once asked you

74
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,350
why you chose me.

75
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,230
Why would you choose

76
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,830
a blind prince like me?

77
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:26,960
And you told me

78
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,350
you didn't choose me

79
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,230
because you hoped that I would ascend the throne

80
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,640
so that you could live a luxurious life.

81
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,200
But because

82
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,880
you thought it was worthwhile.

83
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,790
I know why Second Master died.

84
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,150
I can give up

85
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:06,390
on the throne.

86
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,520
But I must

87
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,470
avenge him.

88
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,350
Did Chong really say that?

89
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,320
It's hilarious.

90
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,960
I've already told you

91
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,390
that Lord Bai has always been cautious.

92
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:24,560
He won't take action

93
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,000
if the situation is undetermined.

94
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:29,000
We can only forgo this pawn.

95
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,080
Do not act rashly.

96
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,590
Are you blaming me,

97
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,390
Director?

98
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:50,910
Your Highness,

99
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:52,960
don't you regret it?

100
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,880
I want to ascend the throne,

101
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,640
but it's not an easy path.

102
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,640
Since I've made the choice,

103
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:01,880
I won't

104
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,640
regret any step I take.

105
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,520
Director, you should

106
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,680
figure out what to do next.

107
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,320
I've had everything planned out.

108
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:12,910
Your Highness,

109
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,830
you should stay behind the scenes

110
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:16,000
to map out a strategy.

111
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,960
So I found you a person to spearhead

112
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,000
the operation.

113
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:24,880
Who is it?

114
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,680
The real successor to the throne.

115
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:32,960
It's him?

116
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,000
He's still alive?

117
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,270
General,

118
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:43,640
you have guests.

119
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,120
I won't see them.

120
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:49,710
Well...

121
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:52,960
Hello,

122
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,080
General.

123
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:56,880
Leave us.

124
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:58,270
Yes.

125
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:06,120
General,

126
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,390
I'm sorry to offend you.

127
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,150
Among the Five Eunuchs,

128
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,080
you're the only one who looks right to me.

129
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,390
The rest

130
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,520
either look like scholars

131
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:21,960
or some sort of young masters.

132
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:24,680
Well,

133
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,270
what about me?

134
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,000
You look obedient

135
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:37,120
and have a saccharine smile.

136
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,120
I can tell that you're a treacherous official.

137
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:41,910
But

138
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,790
you're fit to be a eunuch.

139
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:50,830
General,

140
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,590
you must be joking.

141
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:53,960
Well.

142
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:55,200
Say it.

143
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,200
What do you have to see me about?

144
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,080
If it wasn't something important,

145
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,880
it'd be a serious crime

146
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,440
to barge into the General's Residence.

147
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,590
Of course, I'm here

148
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:10,560
because of an important matter.

149
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,680
Now that

150
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,640
Emperor Mingde is severely ill,

151
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:18,270
so a new Dragon Seal Scroll

152
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,350
will be written sooner or later.

153
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:24,200
A talented person chooses a patron of integrity.

154
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,470
Since every sector in Tianqi City

155
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,680
is picking a good master for itself,

156
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:31,710
I'm here to ask

157
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,080
about your choice.

158
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,990
You've got some nerve.

159
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,200
You're publicly starting a partisan dispute.

160
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,070
It's a capital crime.

161
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:45,740
However,

162
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,990
only the losing side will die.

163
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:52,020
Didn't His Majesty ascend the throne

164
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:55,260
with the help of the partisan dispute back then?

165
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,740
My daughter has made

166
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,950
the choice for me.

167
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,620
Xiao Chuhe, Lord Yong'an.

168
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:12,470
The entire Tianqi City

169
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,900
is aware of my choice.

170
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,380
Even His Majesty

171
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:16,830
won't doubt this.

172
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,310
You'll choose

173
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,900
between Lord Bai, Lord Chi,

174
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,310
and Lord Yong'an.

175
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,990
You indeed have no choice

176
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,140
if they're the only candidates.

177
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:30,740
But

178
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,110
what if I offer you

179
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,260
another choice?

180
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:38,310
A

181
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:41,500
better choice.

182
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:47,380
What are you trying to say?

183
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,380
I did speak

184
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:55,020
from my heart.

185
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,430
What have you got?

186
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:04,780
As you expected,

187
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:06,990
a scroll.

188
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,620
The name on the scroll

189
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:13,110
is also as you expected.

190
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:13,900
Where is the scroll?

191
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:16,740
General,

192
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,500
you've underestimated me.

193
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,020
How could I bring

194
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,230
such an important thing with me?

195
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,780
Even if you have the scroll,

196
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,140
it can't change everything.

197
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:40,430
You've joined

198
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,140
the military since sixteen.

199
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:47,470
You've become the general

200
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,590
of Beili

201
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,470
from a patrol captain.

202
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:52,620
However,

203
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:54,860
the two old friends of yours

204
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,260
have already left you.

205
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:01,260
One of them died on the battlefield.

206
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,540
Even his body

207
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:04,430
can't return to his homeland.

208
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,620
Another one died at the execution ground.

209
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,020
He was even persecuted for a serious crime.

210
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:09,500
General,

211
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,620
don't you want to do something

212
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:13,540
for them two?

213
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,110
I'm not

214
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,500
a very patient man.

215
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,140
Just finish what you want

216
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:31,780
to say.

217
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,500
I've found you

218
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:39,110
the best choice.

219
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:42,990
Just one word,

220
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,860
we'll march to Tianqi,

221
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:50,540
and it's all within our grasp.

222
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,110
[Snowfall Villa]

223
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:58,710
I suspect that it's Director Jinxuan

224
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,990
from the Five Eunuchs,

225
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,470
the top master in the imperial city.

226
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:05,950
How sure are you about it?

227
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:08,230
Ninety percent.

228
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,350
You can tell Lord Bai about this.

229
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:13,590
Killing Jinyu

230
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:14,900
is tantamount

231
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,070
to making Lord Bai take our side.

232
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,190
No rush.

233
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:19,620
It's not time yet.

234
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:21,590
When the time comes,

235
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,310
I'll make them pay for this.

236
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:27,140
I've given the drop of blood
that Consort Xuan gave

237
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,350
to Hua Jin.

238
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:29,500
Hua Jin said

239
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,950
she only needs two-week time

240
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:31,660
to derive a pill.

241
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,470
But,

242
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,260
Lord Chi never gives others

243
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,710
a chance to get a break.

244
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:36,950
Next,

245
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,620
he'll use a drastic measure

246
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:39,620
to turn the tide.

247
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:00,500
Well,

248
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,590
we'll stop talking about it.

249
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:04,230
Let's talk about something casual.

250
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:07,260
Qianluo seems to like you.

251
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,190
Lei Wujie

252
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,020
really likes you.

253
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,500
I didn't expect you

254
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:19,620
to change the subject.

255
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,140
I just think you're wrong.

256
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:22,900
What's wrong?

257
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:25,020
Not "seems".

258
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,140
She does like me.

259
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:29,540
Xiao Se,

260
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:31,260
you're shameless as always

261
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,500
even after having your name changed.

262
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:37,710
But Lei Wujie seems to think

263
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:39,350
that you like me.

264
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,740
You're more shameless than before.

265
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:45,710
Ruoyi,

266
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,230
actually, I know

267
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:50,020
you like Lei Wujie too.

268
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:51,430
I knew it

269
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,950
when you danced with him

270
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,140
on the Flora Spectacle.

271
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,780
I found the most primitive

272
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,310
and the purest quality

273
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,070
of a man on Lei Wujie.

274
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,740
We once had the quality before.

275
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,350
But due to various reasons,

276
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,190
we forwent it.

277
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,860
Only he still has it.

278
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:08,900
Wuxin once said

279
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:10,900
he was born with a pure heart.

280
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,230
What about you?

281
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:13,740
Do you like Qianluo?

282
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:15,830
I don't see a connection

283
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,060
between these two matters.

284
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:18,740
Tianqi City

285
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:20,550
is currently in tumult,

286
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:21,860
but we still have the mood

287
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,340
to chit-chat with each other.

288
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:24,620
If this gets out,

289
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,340
it'll be a joke.

290
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:27,910
You change the subject again.

291
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,310
If I was a playboy,

292
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,860
I would've gotten married four years ago.

293
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,670
She's got a pretty face and a beautiful body.

294
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:38,070
Besides, she's a bit wayward.

295
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,070
She's kind of a fair lady.

296
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:41,790
You sound like

297
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,580
a playboy who's watching

298
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,220
courtesans at Drunken Dream House.

299
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,220
Well, do you like Qianluo?

300
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:48,390
I do.

301
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,500
I have work to do, so if you'll excuse me.

302
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:03,620
You're here.

303
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:06,430
Your Majesty.

304
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,390
Thank you.

305
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:10,270
Take a seat.

306
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:16,790
Divine Healer,

307
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,620
I heard that you caught a cold

308
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,620
a while ago.

309
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:21,980
How are you now?

310
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:22,460
Feeling better?

311
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:23,740
Of course.

312
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:24,580
It was just a cold,

313
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,860
how could it get me baffled?

314
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,620
You're the Divine Healer.

315
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,740
How did you catch a cold?

316
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:35,220
Your Majesty,

317
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,190
I'll give you

318
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,070
acupuncture therapy later.

319
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:45,580
Divine Healer,

320
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,620
you've been sticking

321
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,430
so many needles in my body

322
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,270
these days.

323
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,340
Is it that hard

324
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:54,910
to cure my disease?

325
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:57,430
Your Majesty,

326
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:58,950
do you know

327
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,100
what a healer always says?

328
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:01,740
What is it?

329
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,580
Mental illness is the cause of all diseases.

330
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,100
Something is bothering you.

331
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,140
I can't cure this.

332
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,500
Mental illness is the cause

333
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,340
of all diseases.

334
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,270
I understand

335
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,430
what you're saying.

336
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,270
It doesn't help.

337
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,270
It needs to be cured.

338
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,390
Whoever started the trouble should end it.

339
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:24,820
Your Majesty,

340
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,460
who is your problem solver?

341
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:33,190
He's dead.

342
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:34,910
He's dead?

343
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:37,500
Yes.

344
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,790
We were so close.

345
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,700
Our mother died

346
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:50,310
when we were young.

347
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:52,340
We were princes.

348
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,500
But we never got

349
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:58,270
pampered.

350
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,150
Even

351
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,910
the eunuchs with some power

352
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,260
would dare to pick on us.

353
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:06,430
Physician,

354
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,180
go back and save him, will you?

355
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,150
Your Highness.

356
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,830
Don't go!

357
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:12,390
I can't.

358
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:13,670
(When my younger brother was six,)

359
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,020
he caught a severe cold.

360
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,350
It was still not cured
after being treated for so long.

361
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:21,980
When he nearly died...

362
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,390
Save my brother, will you?

363
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:25,430
Your Highness,

364
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:27,910
it's not that I don't want to treat him.

365
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,430
There's nothing I can do.

366
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:32,180
[Young Xiao Ruojin]
My hands are tied.

367
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:33,460
Save him, please!

368
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:34,460
Your Highness,

369
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:35,830
please go back.

370
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,630
Did he die that day?

371
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,540
This was what they said in the rumor.

372
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:46,740
On that snowy night,

373
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:49,780
I had knelt

374
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:53,060
at the door and begged that imperial physician

375
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:54,670
for four hours.

376
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:56,430
I

377
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,740
was a less coddled prince.

378
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,430
But an imperial physician

379
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,500
was ineligible

380
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:05,460
to afford this kind of kneeling.

381
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:08,830
In the end, I saved

382
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:12,300
my brother from death.

383
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:15,350
Your Majesty,

384
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:16,980
you're a righteous man.

385
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,350
But that was fake.

386
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:20,220
It was a story

387
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,780
I told the imperial physician

388
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:23,870
to spread to the world.

389
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:26,980
What really happened was

390
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:29,590
that night,

391
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,300
I had knelt for four hours.

392
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,150
But he insisted on leaving.

393
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,590
So I drew

394
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,630
the long sword my mother left for me.

395
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,590
I stabbed him with it.

396
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,110
From that moment on, I swore

397
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,350
that I'd never be a prince

398
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,300
who's a nobody.

399
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:54,910
I'd never be trodden

400
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,190
underfoot by others again.

401
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,390
I wanted to reach the top of Tianqi

402
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,350
with my younger brother.

403
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,430
So that everyone

404
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,540
wouldn't dare to look down on us.

405
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:05,780
Then,

406
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:07,830
I became the Emperor.

407
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,300
My brother

408
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:14,020
became Beili's Governor-in-Chief.

409
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,020
Not to mention Tianqi,

410
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:17,500
even Beili

411
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,300
and the entire world

412
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:20,980
would be afraid of us.

413
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:25,780
But in the end,

414
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,740
my brother died.

415
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:37,740
I killed him.

416
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:41,110
It was because

417
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,830
I couldn't gather my courage,

418
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,670
and I was afraid of losing

419
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,630
the vanity in my hands.

420
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:52,460
Your Majesty,

421
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,430
why didn't you call yourself the lonely Emperor?

422
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:56,910
The lonely Emperor?

423
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:01,540
Maybe every time

424
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,830
when I think of my brother, Ruofeng,

425
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,220
I see myself

426
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:13,780
as an elder brother

427
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,300
instead of an emperor.

428
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,630
Only when the younger brother was around,

429
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:26,950
the elder brother

430
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,950
would never feel lonely.

431
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:52,830
Uncle Pichuan,

432
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,630
are you tired of living

433
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:56,910
such a dull life?

434
00:20:59,460 --> 00:20:59,830
What do you think?

435
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:05,110
This blade of mine is getting rusty.

436
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,300
I kind of miss Tianqi.

437
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,830
I'd like to gamble at Qianjin Gambling House,

438
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,060
have a drink at Diaolou Parlor,

439
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,950
and take a nap at Rainbow and Moon Pavilion.

440
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:19,790
You have no ambition.

441
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,110
How could His Highness

442
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:21,740
have a son like you?

443
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,070
I'm just

444
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:23,940
kidding.

445
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:24,980
It seems like

446
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,070
we can be summoned back

447
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:26,830
only when Xiao Se

448
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,020
becomes the Emperor.

449
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:30,550
It's not necessarily the case.

450
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,340
We can go back on our own.

451
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,110
Based on the latest news,

452
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:36,550
Emperor Mingde

453
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,590
has been severely ill lately.

454
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:40,590
Severely ill?

455
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:42,550
Do you have any plans, Your Highness?

456
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,650
[It's time to return to Tianqi now.]

457
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,070
The fire

458
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,790
that brings us back to Tianqi is here.

459
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,980
It's not Xiao Se who lights it,

460
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:03,660
but sometimes,

461
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,790
fate is strange.

462
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,790
Everything comes to me

463
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,140
when I want to go back.

464
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:09,830
Well, then.

465
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,020
Let's get ready

466
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:13,180
and march to Tianqi.

467
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,110
You're up late.

468
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,630
Are you waiting for some kind of good news?

469
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:32,310
I'm sure it's not good news

470
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,260
as you're here.

471
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:34,390
Fine.

472
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:35,550
Since you put it this way,

473
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,420
I'll leave now.

474
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:37,260
I won't cause trouble for you.

475
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,220
I was joking.

476
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:42,830
Your best buddy has laid dormant for years.

477
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,260
He seems a little restless recently.

478
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,500
Are they coming back?

479
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:54,150
Yes.

480
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:55,940
But you don't look surprised.

481
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,260
Based on our enemy's ways

482
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,550
of doing things,

483
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:02,910
once the time comes,

484
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:05,260
they'll take this step.

485
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:08,060
But what is it

486
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,070
that attracts them?

487
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:10,910
It's not known.

488
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:13,150
Baixiao Sect only found out

489
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,020
that before this,

490
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,790
Jinyan went to the General's Residence.

491
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:16,980
Then, the General

492
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,590
secretly sent 16 secret agents

493
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:19,910
out of the city.

494
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,700
It should be the Dragon Seal Scroll.

495
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,310
What is a Dragon Seal Scroll?

496
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:28,500
Back then,

497
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,310
during the Eight Lords Rebellion,

498
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,460
each prince barged into the palace

499
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:33,980
and went all the way to Pingqing Hall.

500
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,150
They were waiting

501
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,830
for the dying late Emperor

502
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:37,790
to send out

503
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,870
the Dragon Seal Scroll,

504
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:40,070
hoping their names were written on it.

505
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:41,390
But

506
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:43,590
only Lord Langya and Emperor Mingde

507
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:44,660
won in the end.

508
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:46,110
But when they

509
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,500
were about to step into Pingqing Hall,

510
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:50,460
the Five Eunuchs came out with the scroll.

511
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,790
Was Emperor Mingde's name written on the scroll?

512
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,500
The Five Eunuchs refused to announce it

513
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,700
despite holding the scroll.

514
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,390
At last, Lord Langya stepped forward

515
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:00,220
and took the scroll.

516
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:01,870
He tore it

517
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:02,630
after taking a glance at it.

518
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:03,590
Then, he announced

519
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,980
that the throne was passed
to the Third Prince, Xiao Ruojin,

520
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,740
which is the present Emperor Mingde.

521
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,350
It means it wasn't Xiao Se's father's name

522
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:12,660
that was written on the scroll.

523
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,590
Otherwise, why would he tear it?

524
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:15,350
Right.

525
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:16,740
But the Five Eunuchs

526
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:17,830
who were in charge of this

527
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,260
chose to remain silent.

528
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:20,020
So,

529
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,180
no one continued

530
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,260
to pursue this matter.

531
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:23,910
But there are two

532
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:24,980
Dragon Seal Scrolls.

533
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:27,070
One of them is guarded by the Five Eunuchs.

534
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,350
It means to declare the decree.

535
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:29,420
Another one is guarded

536
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,700
by the Directorate of Astronomy.

537
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:31,940
It means to accept Heaven's will.

538
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:33,830
After one of the scrolls was torn,

539
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:34,940
another one

540
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,660
should be sent to the Directorate of Astronomy.

541
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,150
But it just disappeared.

542
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,550
Why did the Five Eunuchs allow him to do it?

543
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:42,630
There's only one possibility.

544
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,740
It was Uncle Langya's name

545
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:46,980
that was written on the scroll.

546
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,180
He tore the edict

547
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,940
that had his name on it.

548
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:53,790
The Five Eunuchs couldn't stop him.

549
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,150
But several years later,

550
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,150
Lord Langya established
brilliant achievements in war.

551
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,220
The people respected him.

552
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:00,870
The missing scroll

553
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,110
suddenly appeared.

554
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,500
Lord Langya didn't want to take the throne,

555
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:05,630
but there were growing voices

556
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:06,630
in the Imperial Court,

557
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,180
the army, and civil society,

558
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,260
wanting him to be the Emperor.

559
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,260
The person who hid that scroll

560
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:13,660
was going

561
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,260
to make the brothers

562
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:17,500
turn against each other
so he could achieve his goal.

563
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:21,980
The new emperor took the throne.

564
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,390
The Five Eunuchs of the late Emperor

565
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:27,180
were going to guard the mausoleum.

566
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,300
But Director Zhuoqing was extremely powerful

567
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,940
at that time.

568
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:34,350
So he

569
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:35,870
wouldn't be pleased with that.

570
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,550
From the very beginning,

571
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:39,140
he hid the Dragon Seal Scroll

572
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:41,460
and waited for that day to stage a coup.

573
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:42,900
I guess

574
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,070
he was the one

575
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,420
who caused Lord Langya's case.

576
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,750
He just didn't expect Uncle Langya

577
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:51,900
to die

578
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,110
at the execution ground

579
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:54,460
before

580
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,220
he revealed the scroll.

581
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:58,140
And he died at the mausoleum

582
00:25:58,870 --> 00:25:59,750
a month later.

583
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:01,350
Baixiao Sect

584
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:02,940
didn't find out about this.

585
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:04,980
Because it was Jinxuan

586
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,030
who hurt me back then.

587
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,700
And Jinxuan was the closest disciple

588
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,140
of Zhuoqing.

589
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,460
After Zhuoqing died,

590
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,750
the Dragon Seal Scroll went missing again.

591
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,660
I think it's most likely

592
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,510
in his hands.

593
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,620
And Jinyan

594
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,700
is Jinxuan's most valued helper

595
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,350
among the Five Eunuchs.

596
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,660
As he could persuade the General,

597
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,900
besides knowing the whereabouts

598
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,270
of Uncle Langya's old army,

599
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:28,980
he should have

600
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,350
enough leverage to do that.

601
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,220
The only thing I can think of

602
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,470
is the Dragon Seal Scroll.

603
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:36,830
I don't get it.

604
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:38,340
Isn't General Ye

605
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,140
Ruoyi's father?

606
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:41,180
Isn't he

607
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,180
always on our side?

608
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,470
Ye Xiaoying was the most loyal subordinate

609
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:48,900
of Uncle Langya.

610
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,790
He has waited for this moment for so long.

611
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:54,710
Unfortunately,

612
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:57,470
we're aiming for the same target.

613
00:26:58,830 --> 00:26:59,790
But we've got

614
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:02,070
different choices.

615
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:05,770
[Endurance]

616
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:16,470
Ruoyi,

617
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:21,270
I was 17 when I first met

618
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:23,580
him.

619
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,230
I was the son of a butcher in Tianqi.

620
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:29,340
That time,

621
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,580
I took a butcher knife

622
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:33,380
and looked at him.

623
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:35,580
He told me

624
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,550
he saw an aura of a protector in me

625
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:41,230
when I was slaughtering the hogs and goats.

626
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,140
He asked

627
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,100
if I'd protect the nation with him.

628
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,380
Yet, I told him

629
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:49,340
to get lost

630
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:50,620
if he didn't want to buy meat.

631
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:55,940
Then,

632
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:58,990
I became a patrol captain.

633
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:00,620
Then,

634
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,340
I became the vice general
of the Pioneer Battalion.

635
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:05,340
There was one time,

636
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:08,270
we were surrounded by the enemy.

637
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:11,270
The entire Pioneer Battalion was wiped out.

638
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,710
I was taking my last breath.

639
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:14,900
And he

640
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,380
got me out

641
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:18,420
of the pile of bodies.

642
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,380
That was

643
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:22,790
when I swore

644
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:25,750
to die for him.

645
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:27,710
I didn't hear you

646
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,940
talk about this before.

647
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:34,270
It

648
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:36,660
was a long time ago.

649
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:39,510
And then,

650
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,070
I became General of Agile Cavalry,

651
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,510
Generalissimo, and then Defender-General.

652
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,340
The late Emperor bestowed a golden armor on me

653
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:50,710
and gave me the title of Golden Armor General.

654
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:54,470
But I was still willing

655
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,710
to be

656
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,990
the subordinate who followed his lead.

657
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:02,470
But he died

658
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:04,790
that day.

659
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:10,070
He didn't die on the battlefield

660
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:15,030
but at the execution ground.

661
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:20,070
A month before that happened,

662
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,660
Lord Langya suddenly condemned me.

663
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,340
He took away my tally as a result

664
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:28,860
of my lax control of the army force.

665
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:30,620
I know.

666
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,380
Emperor Mingde didn't kill me

667
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:36,310
just to prevent mutiny.

668
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:39,750
He saved this position for me

669
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,710
just to comfort me.

670
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:44,510
Over years,

671
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:48,420
I've indeed pretended to be comforted.

672
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:51,270
So the entire world

673
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,310
knows that I, Ye Xiaoying,

674
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,470
hold a grudge against the Emperor

675
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,940
due to Lord Langya's death.

676
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,310
But I dare not revolt

677
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:04,030
as I'm afraid of the Emperor.

678
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:08,230
This is the outcome

679
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:10,900
that everyone wants.

680
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:14,230
Well,

681
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:16,900
I'll just show it to them.

682
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,770
[Endurance]

683
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:20,790
Why are you being

684
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:21,860
so emotional tonight?

685
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:24,940
Ruoyi,

686
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:27,100
today,

687
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,900
I'll send a team of elite soldiers

688
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,100
to escort you out of the city.

689
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,580
Stay away from Tianqi for a while.

690
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:35,620
Why?

691
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:39,100
His condition is getting worse.

692
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,710
He'll die anytime.

693
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:43,230
Moreover,

694
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,180
the princes in Tianqi City are engaged

695
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:47,940
in a fierce fight.

696
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:51,140
I'm afraid there will be upheaval.

697
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:52,860
Upheaval?

698
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:56,340
When have you ever been afraid of upheaval?

699
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,270
Isn't that

700
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,070
what you always wanted?

701
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:01,660
You acquiesced to my decision

702
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,990
on helping Xiao Se.

703
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:05,900
Why would you suddenly send me out of the city?

704
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:11,230
Fine.

705
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:13,580
Let me ask you.

706
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:17,470
Did Xiao Chuhe enter Tianqi

707
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:20,900
to take the throne

708
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:22,830
or to investigate

709
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,790
the case?

710
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,580
From what I know of him,

711
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,100
he is here for the case.

712
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,340
That's it.

713
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:32,710
Xiao Chuhe

714
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:34,940
never understands this.

715
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,230
Only the Emperor

716
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,710
can find out the truth of this case.

717
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,860
It's impossible for an official

718
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:43,420
to turn against the Emperor.

719
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:45,790
Therefore,

720
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,470
in the battle between him

721
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:48,620
and Lord Chi,

722
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:50,420
I don't think he'll win.

723
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:52,660
But you used

724
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:53,310
to value him.

725
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:55,750
I valued him because I wanted to watch over him.

726
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:58,510
Just like how I watched
over Lord Langya back then.

727
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,140
He's got the capability and the guts,

728
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,420
but he's not ruthless enough.

729
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:07,310
What happened to Lord Langya in the end?

730
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,790
He died.

731
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:12,660
He was killed by his own brother.

732
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:14,790
I don't want

733
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:17,900
to see the same thing happen again.

734
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,420
Just because Xiao Se

735
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,070
never accepted

736
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,030
your support?

737
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:27,550
Ruoyi,

738
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,140
there's one thing you must understand.

739
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:35,140
He's Xiao Ruojin's son, after all.

740
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,140
No matter what,

741
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:39,790
Lord Langya was just his uncle.

742
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:41,420
He's done well enough.

743
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:44,100
Lord Langya was right about him too.

744
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,550
But I

745
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,140
don't want to wait any longer.

746
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:54,830
I don't agree with you.

747
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:56,580
Since you believe

748
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,180
that it's right,

749
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,750
just stay the course.

750
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:01,340
I know what you're thinking.

751
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:03,420
You've endured for years.

752
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:04,990
You only held back

753
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,100
what you didn't write down.

754
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:07,620
But that thing

755
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:09,230
is wrong, to begin with.

756
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:11,070
Ruoyi.

757
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:13,900
Ruoyi.

758
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:23,140
They're still young.

759
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:26,120
[Endurance]

760
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:43,400
[Revolt]

761
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:47,970
[Jingxue Pavilion]

762
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,110
I heard that you moved

763
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,980
to Snowfall Villa last night.

764
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:53,350
Not just yesterday.

765
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:54,590
From now on,

766
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:55,460
I'll stay here.

767
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,270
Did you have a fight with your father?

768
00:33:59,110 --> 00:33:59,900
This is new.

769
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:01,220
Since childhood,

770
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,420
I've never seen General Ye

771
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:03,110
say

772
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:04,110
anything harsh to you.

773
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:06,350
He said something strange to me yesterday.

774
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:08,540
What did he say?

775
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:10,540
He doesn't think

776
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,670
you will win

777
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:13,420
in the Battle of Tianqi.

778
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:14,830
He even said

779
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,230
if you stay as an official,

780
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:18,020
no matter how determined you are,

781
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,790
you still can't exonerate Lord Langya.

782
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,940
It looks like what worries me the most

783
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,500
has already happened.

784
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:27,020
You mean the Dragon Seal Scroll?

785
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,980
You didn't say this

786
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,190
to your father's face, did you?

787
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:32,460
Of course not.

788
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,940
If he had known we were looking into this,

789
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:36,710
he wouldn't have let me leave.

790
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,460
I suppose he has accepted

791
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,420
that scroll.

792
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,020
Next, I guess

793
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:43,630
he'll gather Langya Army

794
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,710
and contact Xiao Lingchen

795
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:46,310
to start the rebellion.

796
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,630
That's what I thought too.

797
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,190
But hearing you say this,

798
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,100
it means this will happen for sure.

799
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,230
This will be the biggest rebellion

800
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,630
since the establishment of Beili.

801
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:00,870
Hundreds of thousands of cavalries

802
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,710
will set foot on the entire land

803
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,100
and march to Tianqi.

804
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,150
Countless citizens

805
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:07,310
will suffer because of this.

806
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:08,630
The nations

807
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:10,020
that lay dormant around Beili

808
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,350
will take this chance to make a move.

809
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:14,790
But I don't understand.

810
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,580
What good is it

811
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:17,630
to Lord Chi

812
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:18,540
if Langya Army rebels?

813
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:20,900
Why would the Dragon Seal Scroll

814
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,310
appear at this very moment?

815
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:23,870
Why would they go to your father

816
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:25,190
right when it appeared?

817
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:28,190
If Xiao Lingchen eventually ascends the throne,

818
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:30,420
Lord Langya has his place back
at the ancestral shrine.

819
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,630
What good does that do them?

820
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:35,900
I still can't figure this out yet.

821
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:37,980
But there's one thing for sure.

822
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:40,060
This is definitely a trap.

823
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:42,580
I believe your father could figure this out.

824
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,270
But he

825
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,670
will still fall for it.

826
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,060
Because he's a man with a strong ego.

827
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,670
He has no doubt about himself.

828
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:52,940
Even if he was trapped in a cage,

829
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,420
he could still kill the sick tiger

830
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:55,790
and leave without injury.

831
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,060
In the end, he'd kill the hunter.

832
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:02,060
Indeed, he has always been conceited.

833
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,350
But this ego

834
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,630
will eventually get him killed.

835
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:09,100
He'll drag the entire Langya Army

836
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,830
and Xiao Lingchen down.

837
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,670
Even if he wins in the end,

838
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,310
it'll also cause Beili to suffer a heavy loss.

839
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:24,310
[Lord Chi's Residence]

840
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:25,150
The General has made a move?

841
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:27,980
Yes.

842
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:30,380
Today, he

843
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:32,790
has secretly left the city.

844
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:36,060
I thought it'd take him a long time to make

845
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:36,980
this decision.

846
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:38,790
Perhaps,

847
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,750
he already made

848
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:43,670
this decision four years ago.

849
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:45,500
He was just waiting for a chance.

850
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:47,310
Now that the chance has come.

851
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,670
There's no need to hesitate anymore.

852
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,540
What were the terms?

853
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:53,230
I said

854
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,420
I want a new emperor,

855
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:56,940
the old rules to be abolished,

856
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:59,420
the Five Eunuchs not to guard
the mausoleum anymore,

857
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:00,150
and him

858
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:03,420
to give me the title of Marquis.

859
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:05,670
Did he agree?

860
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,830
He accused me of being a cunning subordinate

861
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,060
who tried to be

862
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:13,190
the powerful official of the previous dynasty.

863
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,060
But at last,

864
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:16,870
he agreed with me.

865
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:18,790
Your Highness,

866
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:20,100
did Ye Xiaoying

867
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:21,100
sense something?

868
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,230
Don't be silly.

869
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:23,580
Ye Xiaoying

870
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:24,750
is not an ordinary soldier.

871
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,380
Of course he did sense something.

872
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:27,710
He just didn't expect me

873
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:28,830
to be

874
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,380
the mastermind

875
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,630
behind all this.

876
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:33,900
Longxie,

877
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:35,940
go tell the two generals

878
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:37,980
that the day when they replace

879
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:40,420
Ye Xiaoying and become the leaders

880
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:42,790
of Beili Army is coming soon.

881
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:47,380
His Majesty

882
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,540
evicted all the siblings from here

883
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:50,020
except for me.

884
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:52,540
Do you know why?

885
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,100
Because

886
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:57,940
you were raised by Father.

887
00:37:58,540 --> 00:37:59,900
The other uncles were no match

888
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:00,420
for you.

889
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:02,710
To be more specific,

890
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:04,540
it's because His Majesty knew

891
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:05,870
I wouldn't steal the throne from him.

892
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:07,980
The other princes

893
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,230
were ambitious

894
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:11,630
and ill-intentioned.

895
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:15,350
It'd be troublesome if they stayed in Tianqi.

896
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:20,350
As for me,

897
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:22,710
he trusted me.

898
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,100
Langya wouldn't do that either,

899
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:28,020
so he trusted him as well.

900
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,190
It took years

901
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,060
to build this kind of trust.

902
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,230
It wasn't a one-off project.

903
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:43,270
If so, what about

904
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,710
the case that happened four years ago?

905
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,100
One

906
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:50,670
would change

907
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,380
when he took the throne.

908
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:57,750
Besides, Langya

909
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:00,380
was a lot like an excellent emperor.

910
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:03,420
Historically speaking,

911
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:06,020
those who rise too high

912
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:08,900
won't end up well.

913
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:13,270
Basically,

914
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:17,190
even though you're full of talent,

915
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:19,580
you pretend to be

916
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,710
a good-for-nothing

917
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:23,900
just to cover yourself?

918
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:26,230
No.

919
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,500
I've always been a playboy who likes poems,

920
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:29,870
liquor, and beautiful ladies.

921
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:31,100
I'm not faking it.

922
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:32,060
This is me.

923
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:36,020
Chuhe,

924
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:37,580
I worked hard

925
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,100
when I supervised the nation.

926
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,500
I didn't make a mistake.

927
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:41,830
The officials

928
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,870
complimented me as well.

929
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:45,420
What you said to me

930
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:46,790
was harsh.

931
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:53,230
Since you care about the nation and the people,

932
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,980
let me tell you something.

933
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:57,630
What is it?

934
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:00,230
Fifteen days later,

935
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:01,940
an army will charge into the city.

936
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:04,750
Tianqi will be in danger.

937
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:09,060
Is it so serious?

938
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:11,150
Langya Army.

939
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:12,420
Langya Army?

940
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:14,380
Langya Army doesn't exist in the world anymore.

941
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:17,670
The main force of Beili's army Ye Xiaoying leads

942
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,350
joins forces with Lord Langya

943
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,710
to form Langya Army back in the day.

944
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:23,900
Xiao Se,

945
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,630
do you know what you're talking about?

946
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:27,940
Of course I do.

947
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,460
If the army that I mentioned

948
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:31,060
gathers up,

949
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,580
this dynasty will collapse.

950
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:38,230
You don't look like you're joking.

951
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:40,300
20,000 people in Wangli Army,

952
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,300
3,000 imperial guards,

953
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:44,350
8,000 Tianqi City Soldiers,

954
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,630
and 1,300

955
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:47,270
Tiger Soldiers,

956
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,380
there are about 30,000 soldiers.

957
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:51,460
But there are 200,000 people in Langya Army.

958
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:54,230
Based on the rule in war, we'll be surrounded
as they have more people.

959
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:56,110
It's 30,000 to 200,000.

960
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,460
We can only defend the city.

961
00:40:58,150 --> 00:40:59,420
By then, divide them into two teams

962
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,630
to rescue His Majesty.

963
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:04,150
When I was on my way back to Tianqi,

964
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,340
there were army forces trying to stop me.

965
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:07,830
So I'm sure

966
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:09,860
the imperial family is behind this.

967
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:12,710
There are several princes in Tianqi City

968
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,340
and several old lords out there.

969
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:15,630
As long as they're from the Xiao family,

970
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,940
they'll have the chance to be the Emperor.

971
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:21,860
You think they're up to something else?

972
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:24,110
There are many guesses about that.

973
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,230
But I can't make a decision

974
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:28,830
until the moment

975
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,190
when the Langya Army arrives at the city.

976
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:34,630
But now, I just hope

977
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,710
you could trust me for once.
