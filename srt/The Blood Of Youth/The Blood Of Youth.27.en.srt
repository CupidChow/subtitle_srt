are way more cunning

191
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,130
than we are.

192
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,060
Xiao Chuhe is good.

193
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:38,660
He is still

194
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:39,500
the same man

195
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:40,810
who can bring me surprises.

196
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,810
Look at the time.

197
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,010
The banquet should start soon.

198
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,770
He wouldn't start so soon.

199
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,100
None of the guests that he's expecting

200
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,540
is there yet.

201
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,540
All of the Four Great Merchants have arrived.

202
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,130
Over the past two years,

203
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,740
they've been under the protection of Lord Chi.

204
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,500
If they are not left without any choice,

205
00:07:58,810 --> 00:07:59,620
they will never

206
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,330
attend the banquet.

207
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:03,620
Lord Chi can help them

208
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,210
reap the biggest benefits.

209
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:06,330
And the Mu family

210
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:08,940
is able to take all of that away

211
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:11,180
just overnight.

212
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:12,540
Your Highness.

213
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,770
Would Lord Chi show up then?

214
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:17,860
No.

215
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,810
In Tianqi City,

216
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,940
no matter how rich they are,

217
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,660
merchants will only be merchants.

218
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,250
The true aristocrats

219
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,770
don't even take them seriously.

220
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,420
Ministers of the Six Ministries.

221
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,370
The Seven Censors of the Imperial Censorate.

222
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,090
The Court of Judicature. Longtu Pavilion.

223
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:36,210
The fact that they're unresponsive

224
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,850
proves that Tianqi City

225
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:40,850
has yet to acknowledge

226
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,420
the return of the prince.

227
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:48,300
Second Master Tu.

228
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,970
It's almost time for the banquet to begin.

229
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:53,490
What's wrong?

230
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,260
Is everyone getting anxious?

231
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,940
They might get the impression

232
00:08:59,090 --> 00:08:59,940
that they may be

233
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,660
too insignificant

234
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,140
or too unimportant

235
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:04,900
for the Sixth Prince

236
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:07,450
to start the banquet.

237
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,850
What do you think, Your Highness?

238
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:17,490
They're here.

239
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:20,810
Marquis Lanyue?

240
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,210
Lei, Miss Ye.

241
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:24,940
Nice to meet you.

242
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:25,900
Greetings, Marquis.

243
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:26,490
Greetings, Marquis.

244
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,490
Please come in, Marquis.

245
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:28,420
Please.

246
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,690
Marquis Lanyue has arrived.

247
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,060
Marquis Lanyue is here?

248
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:32,850
This Qianjin Gambling House of mine

249
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,450
is so privileged!

250
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:37,330
Oh...

251
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,060
Seems like His Highness

252
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,690
was not waiting for Marquis Lanyue.

253
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:48,730
Well...

254
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,020
Miss Ye.

255
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,850
[Qianjin Gambling House]
Since your father could not be present today,

256
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:54,940
I will go ahead

257
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,380
and take the spotlight today then.

258
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,730
Guests should attend the banquet with a gift.

259
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:00,700
Are you planning to gift

260
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,260
this good sword of yours to Xiao Se?

261
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,300
I'm not a tasteless man.

262
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:05,690
The gift that I brought

263
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,650
would be the most valuable gift of all.

264
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:13,660
Calling me a gift

265
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:14,900
is rather disrespectful,

266
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,370
don't you think?

267
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:20,020
This is...

268
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:21,900
He's been an imperial official for 50 years

269
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,060
and has remained upright and honest.

270
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,420
He's neither affiliated
with any parties nor noblemen.

271
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:27,140
He found his foothold in the government

272
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,530
with his righteousness

273
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:29,940
and heart for the people.

274
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,940
The honest admire him, and the corrupt fear him.

275
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:34,940
During Imperial Court proceedings,

276
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,700
His Majesty sits on the Dragon Throne

277
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,210
while he has a Crane Seat.

278
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,980
He doesn't need to kneel or stand.

279
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,490
He's the role model for all scholars
in the nation,

280
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,580
the head of the government?

281
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:49,730
Your Highness.

282
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,100
I'm really baffled.

283
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,580
The Grand Preceptor, Dong Zhu.

284
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,420
To think that this gambling house of mine

285
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,810
is housing the greatest scholar ever.

286
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,340
How did you do that?

287
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,610
I have a sword

288
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,180
called Blood Sight.

289
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,180
It was also Uncle Langya's

290
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,490
saber in battle.

291
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,180
Years ago, the Grand Preceptor

292
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,850
went to war with the army.

293
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,060
At the moment of life and death,

294
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,850
Uncle Langya saved him with this sword.

295
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,100
A life-saving debt is the heaviest of all.

296
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:18,610
But you're exchanging it

297
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,940
for a meal with the Grand Preceptor?

298
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:20,730
No.

299
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,060
It is not him that I'm aiming for.

300
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,460
I'm aiming for all civil and military officials.

301
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:26,330
-Welcome, Grand Preceptor.
-Welcome, Grand Preceptor.

302
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:27,690
You're very much like

303
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,820
your father.

304
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,410
You're flattering me, Grand Preceptor.

305
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,090
I used to hold you in my arms when you were little.

306
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:38,180
Grand Preceptor.

307
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,140
I can't remember that very well.

308
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:40,980
Of course.

309
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,690
Back then,

310
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,900
you were but a baby.

311
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:47,890
Grand Preceptor.

312
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,530
Chuhe is waiting inside.

313
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:50,570
Let's go in.

314
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:52,330
Sure, let's go in.

315
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:53,420
Over here.

316
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,130
Welcoming our guest!

317
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:59,330
Beili's Director of Nation-cum-Grand Preceptor,
Official Dong Zhu,

318
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,420
has arrived.

319
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,250
-Grand Preceptor.
-Grand Preceptor.

320
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:15,260
Grand Preceptor.

321
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:16,610
You're back?

322
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:19,970
Yes, I'm back.

323
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,340
It's good to have you back.

324
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:23,300
Good to have you back.

325
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:26,420
After all, Tianqi City

326
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:27,940
is your home.

327
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:29,450
But...

328
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:33,210
You're better than before.

329
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,490
As expected, getting some experience out there

330
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:36,660
was necessary.

331
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:37,940
Child.

332
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:39,780
You must learn to understand

333
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,140
your father's painstaking intentions.

334
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:45,060
I will keep that in mind.

335
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:51,610
In the bleak autumn wind and chilling weather,

336
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:55,450
the dew turns into frost on plants.

337
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,260
This name of yours

338
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,060
may sound a little melancholic,

339
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:03,540
but it's also very poetic.

340
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:04,450
Grand Preceptor.

341
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:05,570
Let's take a seat.

342
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,420
Yes, let's be seated.

343
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,260
Have a seat, please.

344
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,690
Very well, very well.

345
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:14,490
Marquis Lanyue?

346
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:15,450
Father.

347
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,540
Marquis Lanyue

348
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,660
is the current Director of Nation.

349
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,330
If he's in attendance,

350
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:20,980
then we...

351
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,540
Marquis Lanyue may be the Director of Nation,

352
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,060
but he rarely interferes with imperial matters.

353
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,700
This is even more so

354
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,070
after the case of Lord Langya's act of treason.

355
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:33,650
His Majesty has since

356
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,420
abstained from granting authority
to his brothers.

357
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,890
Let me think.

358
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:38,980
Sir, sir!

359
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,010
Why the hurry?

360
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,250
What happened?

361
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,940
Something big happened indeed.

362
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,420
After Marquis Lanyue,

363
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,610
someone else arrived too.

364
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:46,820
Who?

365
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,220
Grand Preceptor, Dong Zhu.

366
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:51,060
What? Grand Preceptor Dong Zhu?

367
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:52,730
Get my palanquin ready, hurry!

368
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:53,980
Please, everyone.

369
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:54,770
Come on, come on.

370
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:55,530
[Qianjin Gambling House]
Here.

371
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:56,580
After you, please.

372
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:56,980
Sure.

373
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:57,700
Please.

374
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,370
Let's go together.

375
00:13:59,060 --> 00:13:59,770
Sure, together.

376
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:00,850
Long time no see, Uncle.

377
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,770
Minister of Revenue,

378
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,220
Official Li Ruochong, has arrived.

379
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,420
Minister of Justice,

380
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,460
Official Zhou De, has arrived.

381
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:13,370
Minister of War,

382
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,010
Official Wu Jingcheng, has arrived.

383
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,730
Minister of Personnel,

384
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,100
Official Xuan Dechong, has arrived.

385
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:23,890
Minister of Rites,

386
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,300
Official Xu Weicheng, has arrived.

387
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,010
Xiao Se.

388
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:29,130
All civil and military officials are here.

389
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:30,770
When are the two princes coming?

390
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:32,650
Before,

391
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,650
we didn't have much time.

392
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:35,890
Now,

393
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,770
they are running out

394
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,820
of time.

395
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,130
Why would the Grand Preceptor

396
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,530
attend a banquet like that?

397
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,250
He'd even skip state banquets

398
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,850
pretending to be sick.

399
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,010
This isn't merely

400
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,130
about his attendance at a banquet.

401
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,370
This is all part of Chuhe's scheme.

402
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:54,490
He took advantage of the two Directors of Nation

403
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,460
to spur

404
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,980
all civil and military officials in the capital.

405
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,650
If they can cause a big scene,

406
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,220
they can force us to give in.

407
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,610
Within two hours,

408
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,770
the ministers of the Six Ministries,

409
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,460
the Four Great Merchants,

410
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,300
and even the Mu family of Qingzhou

411
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:11,250
as well as Grand Preceptor Dong Zhu

412
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,610
came for him.

413
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,420
Lord Yong'an

414
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,820
has too many tricks up his sleeves.

415
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:19,250
Yeah.

416
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,980
Every time we think

417
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,100
that we found his weakness,

418
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:26,300
he'd always find a way around it.

419
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,250
I expected Marquis Lanyue to show up,

420
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,130
but I didn't expect the Grand Preceptor
to show up too.

421
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:32,580
These two individuals,

422
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,060
who claim to be neutral,

423
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,220
attend a banquet like this.

424
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:38,460
How intriguing.

425
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:40,420
But apparently, even now,

426
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,130
Xiao Chuhe has not started the banquet yet.

427
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,370
Xiao Chuhe

428
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:44,890
is still stubborn as ever.

429
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:45,300
What?

430
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:46,460
Must Lord Chi

431
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,340
and Lord Bai arrive

432
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,610
before he finally starts the banquet?

433
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:51,650
Does he assume

434
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,180
that Dong Zhu can force me to attend the banquet?

435
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:54,340
Ridiculous.

436
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,340
Your Highness.

437
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,730
Are we going then?

438
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,060
Chong must be more upset than I am.

439
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,220
After all, he has always been

440
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:06,130
a respectful pupil.

441
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:07,580
For Dong Zhu to be present

442
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:08,890
and him to be absent.

443
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:13,180
That would be rude.

444
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,340
In my opinion,

445
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:19,940
we shouldn't go.

446
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,300
Otherwise, it would be
as if we're admitting defeat.

447
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:23,730
If we don't go,

448
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,850
at least, it shows that we don't care.

449
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:27,820
Oh, Zang Ming.

450
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:31,180
The truth is...

451
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:34,100
We have already lost.

452
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:35,700
Then, Lord Bai

453
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,850
has no reason not to show up.

454
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,130
No.

455
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,490
The best reason he has to be absent

456
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:42,100
is my absence.

457
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,530
If I'm absent,

458
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,530
he can choose to do the same.

459
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,180
So, we are...

460
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:48,650
Not going, of course.

461
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:50,610
I'm not afraid of crossing Dong Zhu.

462
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,130
Chong would be the most upset right now.

463
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:55,180
I'd gladly watch him suffer.

464
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:57,580
Who else chose to be absent?

465
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:59,060
I will be sure to appoint them
to higher positions.

466
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,130
Only the Supervisor of Astronomy is absent.

467
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,140
Supervisor of Astronomy?

468
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:16,810
Chuhe.

469
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:19,250
No matter how good the tea
at Qianjin Gambling House is,

470
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,250
it's not good to have too much of it.

471
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,380
Grand Preceptor isn't saying anything,

472
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,530
but people will accuse you of disrespecting

473
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,660
the Grand Preceptor.

474
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,570
Just wait for a little longer.

475
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:32,860
How long?

476
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,420
When will we start?

477
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,530
About an hour later.

478
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,460
You're waiting for those two?

479
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:42,290
They're not coming.

480
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,660
They won't admit defeat so easily.

481
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,140
Forget it then.

482
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:51,660
Second Master Tu.

483
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:52,530
Your Highness.

484
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,180
Start the banquet.

485
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,530
The banquet...

486
00:17:58,730 --> 00:17:59,700
Wait.

487
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,860
I didn't say I was coming,

488
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:06,050
but I didn't say I won't be coming either.

489
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:08,570
Why rush to start the banquet?

490
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:10,460
Can't you wait for me?

491
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,530
Your Highness.

492
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:16,330
State Preceptor.

493
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:16,900
Marquis.

494
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,620
I may not be interested

495
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:22,730
in feasting and drinking,

496
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,220
but I suppose I should have a taste

497
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,860
of Lord Yong'an's feast.

498
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,010
Oh, State Preceptor.

499
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,420
Grand Preceptor.

500
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:32,620
Grand Preceptor.

501
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,620
It's been a while

502
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:36,700
since we last met.

503
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:38,090
Tell me about it.

504
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,090
State Preceptor.

505
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,660
You're always absent at the Imperial Court.

506
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,810
You only showed up on occasions

507
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:45,980
like festivals

508
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,620
and state banquets.

509
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:50,900
Meanwhile, I attend the Imperial Court daily

510
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,460
yet never show up to banquets.

511
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:56,530
Who would've expected our reunion

512
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:59,810
to happen within Tianqi City's

513
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,770
biggest gambling house?

514
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,420
May I know why you have come?

515
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,770
Because of friendship.

516
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,660
Such a coincidence.

517
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,220
Coincidental, right?

518
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:24,460
I'm Li Fansong,

519
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:25,900
a disciple of Zhao Yuzhen of Mount Wangcheng.

520
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:27,140
I'm Feixuan of Mount Wangcheng.

521
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:28,420
-We pay our respects, Supervisor Qi.
-We pay our respects, Supervisor Qi.

522
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,570
Please rise.

523
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:35,900
Elder Yin once wrote

524
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,900
to say that you're coming

525
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:40,460
to sit in at the Directorate of Astronomy.

526
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,490
You two

527
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,620
are the next generation leaders
of Mount Wangcheng.

528
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,490
It's an honor to have you

529
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,620
at the Directorate of Astronomy.

530
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,570
Thank you, Supervisor Qi.

531
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,900
But before that,

532
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,380
we have another favor to ask.

533
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:54,980
What is it?

534
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:57,330
The one holding the banquet
at Qianjin Gambling House

535
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,770
is an ally of Mount Wangcheng.

536
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,980
We hope to ask you

537
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,290
to attend the banquet.

538
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:07,700
I could not rescue your master

539
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,740
and I feel guilty about my old friend.

540
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,980
As such, I can fulfill

541
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,900
Mount Wangcheng's request and let you sit in

542
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:16,290
at the Directorate of Astronomy.

543
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,300
However,

544
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,090
for me to attend the banquet,

545
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,330
you must give me

546
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,770
a good reason to convince me.

547
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,220
Because the friend

548
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,220
who is hosting the banquet
at Qianjin Gambling House

549
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,290
is closely related

550
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:30,700
to our master's wife.

551
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,740
If she was in Tianqi,

552
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:33,730
she would have come

553
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,530
to invite you personally.

554
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,260
Your master's wife?

555
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:42,770
State Preceptor, Grand Preceptor.

556
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,220
Please have a seat.

557
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:45,290
Please, Your Highness.

558
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:46,010
Marquis.

559
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:46,770
Please, State Preceptor.

560
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:47,940
Grand Preceptor.

561
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:51,810
Now, you can wait

562
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:53,010
for another hour.

563
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:55,860
No need.

564
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,010
The residences of the princes are not far.

565
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:01,490
I believe they would have heard the news

566
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:02,940
when Supervisor Qi was on his way here

567
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:04,730
with the young Taoist.

568
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,260
Welcoming our guests!

569
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:10,180
His Highness, Lord Bai, has arrived.

570
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,940
His Highness, Lord Chi, has arrived.

571
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,700
Are you all starving?

572
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:23,980
Why are you so early?

573
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,140
Can't you wait for me a little?

574
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,940
-Greetings, Lord Bai.
-Greetings, Lord Bai.

575
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,700
-Greetings, Lord Chi.
-Greetings, Lord Chi.

576
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:36,980
Please rise.

577
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,290
You two.

578
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,460
Long time no see.

579
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,660
Long time no see, Chuhe.

580
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:46,940
Chuhe.

581
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:50,180
You got tanned and lost weight.

582
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:52,090
Since you're home,

583
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,420
don't leave anymore.

584
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,140
Rest up at home.

585
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,700
Don't worry.

586
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:03,290
Since I'm back,

587
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,130
I won't leave anytime soon.

588
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,010
That's great.

589
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,660
I initially thought

590
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:16,530
that you wouldn't be coming today.

591
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,740
Something came up at home

592
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:20,900
hence there was some delay.

593
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:23,180
With you traveling out there for years

594
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,500
and finally returning to the capital,

595
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:27,620
as your brother, of course I'd come.

596
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,530
Chuhe is quite influential.

597
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:32,260
The Four Great Merchants

598
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,900
and all civil and military officials are here.

599
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,330
Even Grand Preceptor and State Preceptor
are here too.

600
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:40,220
How can I not show up?

601
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,290
Regardless of your wishes,

602
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,610
you're here now.

603
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:48,010
So you're my guest.

604
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,900
Please have a seat.

605
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,780
With you?

606
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:54,900
Of course not.

607
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:58,090
My seat is over there.

608
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:07,850
Start the banquet.

609
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:15,250
The banquet begins!

610
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:22,860
Here, Official Li.

611
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:23,620
Come, come.

612
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:24,740
It's been a long time since we met.

613
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:26,700
Let's enjoy ourselves today.

614
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,180
Everyone, cheers.

615
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,260
(Cheers.)

616
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:37,940
(Official Liu.)

617
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,220
(Here, Zhao.)

618
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,140
(Such a rare occasion.)

619
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:42,770
(Here.)

620
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:43,900
Grand Preceptor.

621
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:44,660
(Let me fill your cup.)

622
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,500
(Come, come.)

623
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,500
(No need to be so formal.)

624
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,330
(You're being too formal.)

625
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:02,700
Uncle.

626
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:04,860
Yu.

627
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:10,850
(Here.)

628
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,530
(Please, sir.)

629
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:15,010
(Cheers to you.)

630
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:15,740
(Here.)

631
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:17,700
(Down it, down it!)

632
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:23,420
Grand Preceptor.

633
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:25,700
I think his intentions

634
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,050
are very obvious.

635
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:29,140
In just a moment,

636
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:31,810
he should be summoning the ones

637
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:33,090
he wishes to speak with.

638
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:34,940
The topics of discussion

639
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,330
and the deals made

640
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:39,290
would be the greatest secret

641
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:40,860
of this banquet.

642
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:45,980
But he loves

643
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:49,330
to give surprises.

644
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,290
Grand Preceptor.

645
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:55,050
What thoughts do you have

646
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,700
after meeting him again?

647
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:01,010
He is like

648
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:03,980
the untamed foal.

649
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:05,220
When we met,

650
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:06,940
judging from his expressions,

651
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:08,250
I thought he'd changed.

652
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,980
But it seems

653
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:12,700
that the foal

654
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:15,900
has just grown up.

655
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:19,490
Look at the two over there.

656
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:21,770
They had so many conflicts

657
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:22,900
overtly and secretly.

658
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:24,380
But now, they're sitting together

659
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:25,290
and having a meal.

660
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,700
Yeah.

661
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,770
I remember

662
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:32,420
that it's been a long time

663
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,050
since we last ate together.

664
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,290
Did we ever sit together

665
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,290
for a meal?

666
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:38,620
Yes.

667
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:40,860
Back then,

668
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,730
only you and Chuhe

669
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,980
among all our brothers

670
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:46,620
didn't call me a blind man.

671
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:47,900
I remember.

672
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,140
I wonder

673
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:52,460
if the one up there

674
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,980
still remembers.

675
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:56,530
If he does,

676
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:58,770
shouldn't he invite us

677
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,140
for a drink up there?

678
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,810
If you want to, go ahead.

679
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,460
But if you raised a cup to him,

680
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,700
he probably

681
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,090
wouldn't even look.

682
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:12,460
How dare he?

683
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:25,900
Who is that?

684
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,010
Is she Chuhe's lover?

685
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,380
You're here.

686
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,490
Was it tiring to travel

687
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:36,220
from Three-Gaze City?

688
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,140
Yes.

689
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:40,810
Upon arrival,

690
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:42,420
I see Your Highness's

691
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,220
grand banquet.

692
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,380
Sorry.

693
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,090
What is your goal behind hosting this banquet?

694
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,010
To tell them that I'm back.

695
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,900
They can choose to follow

696
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,730
or defy me.

697
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:01,460
I will not rope in

698
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,620
anyone here today.

699
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:05,620
It's all up to their own decisions.

700
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:08,250
You are the mighty Sixth Prince.

701
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,250
You can do that

702
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:11,900
but you must remember

703
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,250
who paved the way for you.

704
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:20,090
I did not forget

705
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,180
and will never forget.

706
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,250
Everyone.

707
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,140
Done with your drinks?

708
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:45,530
Yes!

709
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,940
-Yes!
-Yes!

710
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,220
-Yes!
-Yes!

711
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:50,900
Then let me raise my cup

712
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,140
to all of you.

713
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:03,570
Cheers!

714
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:06,290
-Cheers to Lord Yong'an.
-Cheers to Lord Yong'an.

715
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,090
Cheers to Lord Yong'an.

716
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,010
What...

717
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:21,730
His Highness...

718
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:22,460
His Highness...

719
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,290
What's wrong?

720
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:24,660
What happened to His Highness?

721
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,700
What's wrong?

722
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:27,810
What happened?

723
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:31,010
His Highness is trying to...

724
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,090
This...

725
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,090
What's wrong, Zang Ming?

726
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,530
Lord Yong'an unveiled

727
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:40,180
the stone wall at the top
of the Qianjin Gambling House.

728
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:41,940
The word "libation" is engraved on the wall.

729
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:49,350
[Libation]

730
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:20,730
Drums.

731
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:30,290
Strings.

732
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,490
Lend me your sword.

733
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:46,180
(Dew on scallion leaves)

734
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,090
(dries out easily in the sun.)

735
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:54,220
(Yet tomorrow morning,
it will fall on the scallion leaves again.)

736
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:57,420
(And humans, once dead,)

737
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,090
(will never return.)

738
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,010
(To the land where souls gather,)

739
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:08,140
(all, no matter virtuous or ignorant,)

740
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,900
(will eventually return.)

741
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,770
(Death urges on so hurriedly)

742
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,530
(that human life cannot be extended.)

743
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:18,810
Tang.

744
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:20,140
(Hence, it makes no room for hesitance.)

745
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,180
(Dew on scallion leaves)

746
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,090
(dries out easily under the sun.)

747
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:27,810
(Yet tomorrow morning,
it will fall on the scallion leaves again.)

748
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,250
(And humans, once dead,)

749
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:32,050
(will never return.)

750
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:34,900
(To the land where souls gather,)

751
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:38,180
(all, no matter virtuous or ignorant,
will eventually return.)

752
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:40,730
(Death urges on so hurriedly)

753
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,730
(that human life cannot be extended.)

754
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:44,460
(Hence, it makes no room for hesitance.)

755
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:09,750
[The lotus leaf has floated to the heavens,
but his noble spirit is eternal on earth]

756
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:11,900
Tang Lian.

757
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,180
Rest in peace.

758
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:27,940
This is Zhancui.

759
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,220
The highest kind of mourning dress among
all Five Mourning Garments.

760
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:31,660
Your Highness.

761
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,460
Let's leave for now.

762
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:37,130
All of Tianqi City's prestigious families
and imperial officials

763
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:37,850
are here.

764
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:39,500
He wouldn't act recklessly.

765
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,500
If you could see this sight

766
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,370
for yourself,

767
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:43,740
you'd know what it means

768
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:44,940
to be reckless.

769
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,610
This is comparable to charging into Tai'an Hall

770
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,660
with a sword.

771
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:51,260
Serve the last dish.

772
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:52,090
Last dish?

773
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:52,900
Last dish?

774
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:53,500
Last dish?

775
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:54,570
I have no idea either.

776
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,090
Yeah.

777
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,020
According to royal banquet specifications,

778
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,050
all the dishes have been served.

779
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:01,700
Why is there a last dish?

780
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,610
What... what is this?

781
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:18,570
(I don't know.)

782
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:19,740
(I've never seen it before.)

783
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,420
Tofu rice.

784
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:28,330
What's tofu rice?

785
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:29,500
Doesn't sound appetizing,

786
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,020
Master.

787
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,460
At the place where my martial brother lived,

788
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:37,180
when someone dies,

789
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:39,530
their family

790
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,770
will prepare a tofu feast.

791
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,940
They'd invite the friends of the deceased

792
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:44,980
for a meal.

793
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,020
There will be no meat

794
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,940
but a variety of dishes

795
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,370
made from tofu.

796
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:56,500
And the most important dish of all

797
00:32:58,090 --> 00:32:59,290
is what you see before you,

798
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:00,330
tofu rice.

799
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,740
Tofu can bring longevity.

800
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:06,610
The deceased has passed on.

801
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:10,370
But those who are alive remain.

802
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:13,850
I hope

803
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:15,500
that after you eat this tofu rice,

804
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:18,420
starting today,

805
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:21,810
you can all live

806
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:25,220
a good life in Tianqi City.

807
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,370
In Qingzhou,

808
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:40,020
if you are invited to a tofu feast,

809
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,420
you are not allowed to reject it.

810
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,220
After all,

811
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,420
the deceased deserves our respect.

812
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,050
What do you all think?

813
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:09,820
Come.

814
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:10,730
Let's eat.

815
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:11,570
Come.

816
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:22,610
Grand Preceptor.

817
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:23,900
Marquis.

818
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:25,860
If I'm not mistaken,

819
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:28,380
you're from the South, right?

820
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,500
Yes.

821
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,340
In my hometown,

822
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,610
after someone dies,

823
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:37,340
we all eat a bowl of tofu rice.

824
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,860
But after coming to Tianqi,

825
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:41,900
it's been years

826
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:43,730
since I've had tofu rice like this.

827
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,380
When I die,

828
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,210
I hope everyone

829
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,130
can have a bowl of tofu rice as well.

830
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:00,380
Come on.

831
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:01,940
Let's eat, let's eat.

832
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:03,340
Let's eat, let's eat.

833
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,210
Zang Ming.

834
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:10,900
Bring it to me.

835
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:22,940
You can eat all you want.

836
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:24,130
Longxie.

837
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,540
Let's go.

838
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:32,690
What are you trying to do?

839
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,250
Why aren't you eating the tofu rice?

840
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,250
What does your eldest martial brother's death

841
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,290
have to do with me?

842
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,420
You will soon find out

843
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,540
what it has to do with you.

844
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:49,340
Interesting.

845
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:51,460
Trying

846
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:53,610
to kill me here?

847
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:55,170
Is that a challenge?

848
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,690
Fairy Rui.

849
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:58,610
Please leave for now.

850
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:00,690
I will be sure to give you

851
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:02,650
an explanation about Lian.

852
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,980
Do as I say here.

853
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:15,340
Fine.

854
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:24,610
His Majesty has arrived.

855
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,650
-Welcome, Your Majesty.
-Welcome, Your Majesty.

856
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:26,770
You're back.

857
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,020
I'm back.

858
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:34,860
I heard that you're fully recovered.

859
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:37,130
Yes.

860
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:39,570
That's great.

861
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:42,540
Have you eaten?

862
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,340
We're about to end the banquet.

863
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:48,340
Do you have any food left?

864
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:49,540
I

865
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,210
am hungry.

866
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,980
We only have tofu rice left.

867
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:00,020
Give me a bowl of that then.

868
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:44,380
I've heard from Lanyue

869
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:47,170
about his experiences during his travels.

870
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:49,860
So, Chuhe,

871
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:53,420
did someone pass away?

872
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,020
My eldest martial brother did.

873
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:03,210
You've grown up.

874
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:05,940
I will not lecture you anymore

875
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:07,210
like I used to.

876
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:08,780
Just do whatever

877
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,730
you wish to do.

878
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,290
Okay.

879
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:19,020
Rise, all of you.

880
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,170
I did not intend

881
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:25,090
to neglect you.

882
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:28,290
It just has been too long

883
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:30,420
since I last met my son.

884
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:32,570
So,

885
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,460
I do not want any distractions

886
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,380
while we speak.

887
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:42,820
I hope you can all understand.

888
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:45,340
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

889
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:47,380
Let's go.

890
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:52,250
Your Majesty.

891
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:54,090
Hua Jin.

892
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:55,780
Would you like to stay?

893
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:58,090
Some of my friends are here,

894
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,820
and I've not met them in a while.

895
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:01,500
Fine, then.

896
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,170
Later,

897
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:07,530
tell Yueli to escort you to the palace.

898
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:08,860
Thank you, Your Majesty.

899
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,300
Depart.

900
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,980
-Our regards, Your Majesty.
-Our regards, Your Majesty.

901
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:34,380
You may all leave.

902
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:43,650
He is still the one and only favored son

903
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,980
within Tianqi City.

904
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:48,420
He has always been.

905
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:52,300
Come rest for a moment
at the Directorate of Astronomy.

906
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:53,980
My pleasure.

907
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:55,090
Please, Grand Preceptor.

908
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,420
Please, State Preceptor.

909
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:05,820
Back then,

910
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,380
when I went to Xueyue City for you,

911
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:08,980
you refused to leave.

912
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:11,250
Why are you back now?

913
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:14,820
I like to make my own choices.

914
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:17,020
I am aware of what happened

915
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:18,130
to your martial brother.

916
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:19,820
Regardless,

917
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:22,210
I will be sure to make the culprit

918
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:24,780
pay for what he has done.

919
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,130
Okay.

920
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:28,210
Zang Ming.

921
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:38,570
They must think

922
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:39,570
that we are silly.

923
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,090
Yes.

924
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,500
Exhausting ourselves of all favors

925
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,860
to invite the State Preceptor,

926
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,610
the backbone of the country.

927
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:54,900
Organizing such a grand banquet

928
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:57,460
yet turning it

929
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:58,380
