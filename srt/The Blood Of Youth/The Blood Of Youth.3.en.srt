[Episode 3]

25
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,220
(You didn't let me down.)

26
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,260
(But that)

27
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,820
(won't delay him for too long.)

28
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,020
After witnessing the Fatal Blossom Shower,

29
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,900
pretending to be asleep was worth it.

30
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:39,740
Wuxin.

31
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,060
Wuchan, it's been a long time.

32
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,900
There's somewhere I want to go.

33
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,580
I wonder if this young friend

34
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,900
would like to go with me.

35
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:15,700
No.

36
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,420
Hypocrite.

37
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,060
What do you want?

38
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:31,460
What does that mean?

39
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:33,500
It looks like this young friend

40
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,100
is also willing to travel together.

41
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,500
That's great.

42
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:45,500
Wuxin!

43
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,500
Wangyou,

44
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,180
in the end,

45
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,860
you eventually chose this path.

46
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,940
Twelve years ago, I told you

47
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,500
that sooner or later, you would face disaster

48
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,980
because of that lad, Wuxin.

49
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,540
Have you ever regretted

50
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,620
the decision you made back then?

51
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,980
Of course you won't regret it.

52
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,900
You said

53
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,500
you wished to come back here and have a look

54
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,180
before you die.

55
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:19,700
I'll hold a memorial service for you here today.

56
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,980
I hope your soul will return to your home.

[He was taken away
from Belle's Manor by Ye Anshi.]

59
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,300
Xiao Se?

60
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,580
My dear disciple,

61
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,700
[Ji Ruofeng, Head of Baixiao Sect]
it's time for us to meet.

62
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:04,660
Xiao Se,

63
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,660
why don't we grab this chance and run?

64
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,940
Sure, I wish you the best of luck.

65
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,940
Why aren't you coming?

66
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,260
I'm sure you've seen his qinggong.

67
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,460
Do you think we can outrun him?

68
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,100
Then...

69
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:22,740
Then we'll run

70
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:23,740
after we knock him unconscious.

71
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,940
Sure, I wish you success.

72
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,940
We can't beat him or outrun him.

73
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,060
How can great men like us

74
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,700
be held hostage here?

75
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,020
I never said we can't escape.

76
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,980
But we need to find a place we can survive

77
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:37,980
after we escape from him.

78
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,780
This place is deserted

79
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,420
with nothing here.

80
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,100
You're also heavily injured.

81
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,500
If we got lost,

82
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:45,980
we could die.

83
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,020
Look at you.

84
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,340
No one would expect

85
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,660
you're Lei Hong's disciple.

86
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,020
Do you know my master?

87
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:57,860
Of course.

88
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,660
He was one of the Four Heroes of the Lei Clan
back then.

89
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,020
He may be an external disciple.

90
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,540
But at a young age, he managed to restore

91
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,180
the lost skills of Fire Infusion

92
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,060
with an incomplete book.

93
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,300
When he was at his peak,

94
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,780
his reputation was superior
to the current clan leader,

95
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,900
Lei Qianhu.

96
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,420
My master rarely

97
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,460
talks about himself.

98
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,580
He prefers staying alone.

99
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,420
He'd either stare at the sky or the flowers.

100
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,380
So how much do you know

101
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,380
about my master?

102
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,420
Can you tell me?

103
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,140
It's said

104
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,580
the ancestor of the Lei Clan

105
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,460
once held the ceremony
of hanging up their swords and blades.

106
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,860
They were determined to abandon the use

107
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,340
of the two most commonly used weapons
in the martial arts world.

108
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,780
They embarked on a completely different path

109
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,420
by focusing on developing explosive weapons,

110
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,020
which shocked the martial arts world.

111
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,500
But your master went against
the ancestral teaching

112
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:51,980
and practiced swordsmanship.

113
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,460
He combined it
with the Lei Clan's explosive techniques

114
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,060
and invented the Shabu.

115
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,300
When the sword came into existence,
the thunder roared

116
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,060
and the flame was blazing.

117
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,700
He made a name for himself
as he journeyed the martial arts world

118
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,220
with the sword.

119
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,420
In the end, he was defeated

120
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,300
by Li Hanyi, the Xueyue Sword Deity,

121
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,260
and is nowhere to be found ever since.

122
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:14,580
Some said

123
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,260
he returned to the Lei Fortress
to go into seclusion

124
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,340
and claimed he wouldn't leave
until he becomes a sword deity.

125
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,540
Some said the clan leader, Lei Qianhu,
expelled him from the Lei Clan

126
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,860
because he went against the ancestral teaching.

127
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,340
Those are just rumors.

128
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:28,500
My master was never

129
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,380
expelled from the Lei Clan.

130
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,660
He... he was just...

131
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,020
If you can't say it, don't say it.

132
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:38,820
I'm not interested

133
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,580
in the Lei Clan's secrets.

134
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:40,820
I'm glad to hear

135
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,660
he was not expelled from the Lei Clan.

136
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,180
You sounded

137
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,900
like you know my master.

138
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,100
I don't know him.

139
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,100
Why do you look relieved

140
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,900
when you heard that he was not
expelled from the Lei Clan?

141
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,260
If he were expelled from the Lei Clan,

142
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,380
it doesn't matter if it's Xueyue City

143
00:07:58,780 --> 00:07:59,780
or the Lei Fortress,

144
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,340
who would help his foolish disciple,

145
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,860
who lost the Shabu,

146
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:04,580
pay his debt?

147
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,780
After everything you said,

148
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:07,700
it's all

149
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,900
because of that 500 silver taels.

150
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,060
Wait.

151
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,500
What did you just say?

152
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:14,460
Pay up.

153
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:15,860
No, before that.

154
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,100
The foolish disciple who lost the Shabu.

155
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,100
Shabu.

156
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:22,460
Oh, no.

157
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:23,260
I'm so dead.

158
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,500
How could I lose

159
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,380
the Shabu?

160
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,700
Misfortune has befallen the Lei Clan.

161
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,740
How's your injury?

162
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,340
It's nothing serious.

163
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,620
It just hurts when I try to use my skills.

164
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,340
White-Haired Deity's martial arts skills

165
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,340
are unfathomable.

166
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,060
We were lucky

167
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,660
to be able to survive.

168
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,100
You're right about that.

169
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:52,940
Speaking of which,

170
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,140
it's all thanks to his help.

171
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,180
They killed my father!

172
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:13,180
I want to kill all of them!

If this vicious cycle continues,
when will it all end?

Besides, he's still a child.

177
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:20,780
How many things

178
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,500
have happened to you along the way?

179

You have so many injuries.

180
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:27,540
It's all right.

181
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:28,860
I'm used to it.

182
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:44,740
Where's Master Wuchan?

183
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:45,980
I need to ask him

184
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,140
about Wuxin.

185
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:01,940
Wait here.

186
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,900
I've read a book

187
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,260
that said there are deities in the world.

188
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,460
They could stand on clouds and dress in white.

189
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:33,180
They can live without food,

190
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,420
travel far with the wind,

191
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,140
and never grow old.

192
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,780
It's describing someone like him, right?

193
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,140
I've never met anyone

194
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,220
who masters such incredible qinggong.

195
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,580
It really felt like riding the wind.

196
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,780
It took us so long to get here.

197
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,620
But he doesn't look exhausted at all.

198
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,580
It's incredible.

199
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:53,820
As his hostages,

200
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,060
here we are complimenting him.

201
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,020
What do you think he would feel

202
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:57,980
if he heard us?

203
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,060
Both of you

204
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,260
aren't my hostages.

205
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,900
As I said earlier,

206
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,380
I want you

207
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,180
to accompany me to a place.

208
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,300
There were so many of us in the carriage.

209
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,540
Why did you

210
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,220
have to pick us?

211
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:12,700
You picked us

212
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:13,660
because one of us doesn't know martial arts

213
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,980
and the other one is seriously injured.

214
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,300
Seriously injured?

215
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,300
I may not be skillful.

216
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,420
But I'm willing to help.

217
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,300
You want to treat my injuries?

218
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,300
During this journey,

219
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,380
I still need your help.

220
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,340
So of course, I'll help you

221
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,300
treat your injuries.

222
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,060
I think I'll pass.

223
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,100
You were injured by the White-Haired Deity's

224
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,060
zhenqi.
(*true energy)

225
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,340
If you use your skills,

226
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,820
two different energies will clash.

227
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,220
It certainly will make your injuries even worse.

228
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,820
I'll help you

229
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,420
force out his zhenqi from your body.

230
00:12:59,260 --> 00:12:59,860
(There truly)

231
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,420
(is such mystical qinggong in the world.)

232
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:07,980
I can't swim.

233
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:44,980
What kind of skill

234
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,980
could make him stand on water?

235
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,140
It wasn't me.

236
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,740
He did it himself.

237
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,540
(Lei Wujie did it himself?)

238
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:57,900
Old Wangyou told me

239
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,300
people with conscience and flexibility

240
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,220
can become one with nature.

241
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,740
Turns out he didn't lie to me.

242
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:22,580
Break!

243
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:50,740
It was a success.

244
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,020
You can take him back.

245
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,260
How do you feel?

246
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,100
I feel a tingling

247
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:58,900
and numbing sensation all over.

248
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,820
I feel better too.

249
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,620
The Lei Clan

250
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,620
is a well-known family in the martial arts world.

251
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:05,900
How did they produce

252
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:06,980
such an airhead?

253
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,780
That's not how you pronounce it.

254
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,220
Use the falling tone.

255
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,180
I'll pronounce it the way I want.

256
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:18,940
Airhead.

257
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,820
I'm serious. That's not how you pronounce it.

258
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,580
I don't care.

259
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:23,500
Airhead.

260
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,340
Airhead.

261
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,140
Why are you so stubborn?

262
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,340
How nice.

263
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,820
So Wuxin is the son of Ye Dingzhi,

264
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,380
the Head of the Tianwaitian Sect.

265
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,780
The one Tianwaitian sent to be held
as a hostage in Beili?

266
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:38,660
Precisely.

267
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,540
Twelve years ago, the Demon Sect started a war

268
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,260
to overthrow the imperial power of Beili.

269
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,060
That year, the Governor-General,

270
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:46,860
Lord Langya,

271
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:47,940
led the Three Armies of Beili,

272
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,460
together with Tianqi's Four Guardians,

273
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,060
joining forces with the power
of the whole martial arts world

274
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,580
to defeat the Demon Sect.

275
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,660
When Ye Dingzhi died,

276
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,220
Wuxin was only five years old.

277
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,660
Now, the 12-year armistice

278
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,500
is almost up.

279
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,180
Tianwaitian Sect wants to

280
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,380
bring their master, Wuxin, back.

281
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,300
Wuxin is after all the son of the Demon Sect.

282
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,820
He even holds the 32 Secret Rakshasa Arts.

283
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,340
If we set him free,

284
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,020
it'll bring disaster.

285
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,020
It's reasonable

286
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,290
for Master Dajue to want

287
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,860
to get rid of his martial arts skills

288
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,540
before letting him return to Tianwaitian.

289
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:20,900
I do hope

290
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,900
that's what they really want to do.

291
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:36,820
Why did you help us?

292
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,700
Didn't I tell you

293
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,620
I want to go to a place?

294
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,740
So I need both of you to accompany me.

295
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:45,860
Treating his injuries

296
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,660
is just a small favor.

297
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,420
You see,

298
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,220
your martial arts skills are exceptional.

299
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,060
You don't need our help

300
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,220
to go anywhere you want.

301
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,020
Besides,

302
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:00,620
you're someone Xueyue City

303
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,100
will escort to Jiulong Sect.

304
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,180
Behind me

305
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,580
is a disciple from Xueyue City.

306
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,260
Aren't you afraid

307
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,060
that we'll capture you?

308
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,820
May I be bold

309
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:16,620
to ask you a question?

310
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,820
When we were traveling in the carriage,

311
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:20,380
didn't I

312
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,340
save you both?

313
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:23,900
Now, I only ask

314
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:24,900
for a small favor.

315
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,540
Can't you help me fulfill it?

316
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,660
I feel so disappointed.

317
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:39,780
I'll go with you.

318
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,180
I knew you'd say that.

319
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,620
You saved our lives.

320
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,860
I'll lend you a hand this time.

321
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,380
But after you fulfill your wish,

322
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,860
I still have to bring you back.

323
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:57,340
Sure.

324
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,540
I'll wait for you to capture me

325
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,060
if you're capable.

326
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,660
Since you've decided to travel with me,

327
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,820
we're companions, then.

328
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,860
So let's address each other by name.

329
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,620
What's your name?

330
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,180
Call me Lei Wujie.

331
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:14,820
I'm Xiao Se.

332
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,380
They're all good names.

333
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,380
Where do you want to go

334
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,740
that you need us to go with you?

335
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:21,940
With your remarkable abilities,

336
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:22,820
what kind of place

337
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,020
that you can't go to?

338
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:24,900
Excellent question!

339
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,860
Because I have no money.

340
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,020
If you have no money out here,

341
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,220
it'll be hard to go anywhere.

342
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,540
Then you found the right person.

343
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:37,660
Listen.

344
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,940
Among the people in the carriage,

345
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,140
he's the richest one.

346
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,620
The sleeves of this fur coat alone

347
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,420
already cost 100 taels.

348
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,060
Quiet.

349
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,940
What if I refuse to give you money?

350
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:51,980
Are you going to steal it from me?

351
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,020
[Jade Deity, Directorate of Incense]

352
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:11,380
Your Majesty.

353
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,540
What is it?

354
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,180
Your Majesty.

355
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,060
The Three-Gaze City delivered a message

356
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,620
saying the White-Haired Deity of Tianwaitian
appeared in the Central Plains.

357
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:25,020
We have an agreement with the Tianwaitian Sect.

358
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,940
No one from the Demon Sect is allowed

359
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,340
to enter the Central Plains without permission.

360
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,740
Why did the White-Haired Deity

361
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,780
violate the agreement for no reason?

362
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:35,620
Your Majesty,

363
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,380
the 12-year agreement is almost up.

364
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,780
It's been 12 years already?

365
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:42,980
Is it time yet?

366
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:44,820
Even if there's one more day left,

367
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,580
the 12-year agreement is not due yet.

368
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,420
This devil dares to break the agreement

369
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,260
and enter the Central Plains
without permission.

370
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,420
He's pushing us around
because we have no one capable.

371
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:56,540
I ask that Your Majesty

372
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,140
order the capture of this devil.

373
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:03,940
I remember

374
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,660
you were friends

375
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,140
with Wangyou of the Hanshui Temple.

376
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,180
Your Majesty,

377
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,780
Abbot Wangyou gave me directions

378
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,980
when I was traveling the martial arts world.

379
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:18,620
But it was only a direction.

380
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,540
I dare not claim that he was my friend.

381
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:22,820
Never mind.

382
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:27,740
Let the martial arts world
take care of its issues.

383
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,260
Since those from Tianwaitian are here,

384
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,090
I want you

385
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,460
to take care of them for me.

386
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,260
As you command, Your Majesty.

387
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:38,660
Your Majesty,

388
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,380
what about that hostage?

389
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,940
I'll leave it for you to decide.

390
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:46,700
Yes, Your Majesty.

391
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,220
(Does His Majesty want me)

392
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,180
(to kill him or not?)

393
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,060
(Forget it. I'll check things out first.)

394
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,940
(I must not let Tianwaitian take him.)

395
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,620
[Pawn]

396
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:04,140
Xiao Se,

397
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,740
stop hesitating already.

398
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,420
The weather is getting hot now.

399
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:08,580
This fur coat

400
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,700
will only be your burden.

401
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:10,540
What do you know?

402
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,580
My expensive fur coat

403
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,780
was custom-made in Yuxiu Boutique in Tianqi City.

404
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,660
It took three months to complete it.

405
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,300
It's windproof and protects you from heat.

406
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,340
And comfortable to wear all year round too.

407
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,820
I've heard it so many times already.

408
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,620
If we have no money,

409
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:25,620
we can't eat

410
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,060
let alone rent a horse.

411
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,100
Then can't you...

412
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,060
He's right, Mr. Xiao.

413
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,980
Money is worldly possession.

414
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,820
Stop hesitating already.

415
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,100
You should let go when it's time.

416
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,260
Are you two ganging...

417
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,180
Come on. Let's go.

418
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:40,820
Let me go.

419
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,460
Stop hesitating. The pawn shop is just ahead.

420
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,660
[Pawn]

421
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:47,260
[Yulanxuan Restaurant]

422
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,540
Excuse me, another serving of ham hock!

423
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,220
No!

424
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,500
We only have ten silver taels.

425
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,500
Money is just worldly possession.

426
00:21:58,860 --> 00:21:59,380
Quiet.

427
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,620
We only have ten silver taels.

428
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:04,940
After this meal,

429
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,460
we might have no money for our next meal.

430
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,180
Mr. Xiao,

431
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,020
we should enjoy ourselves while we can.

432
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:15,540
You too.

433
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,820
If we have no money after this,

434
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,820
we can only count on you to beg for alms.

435
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:22,460
So,

436
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,380
can I order one serving of pork shoulder?

437
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,620
Of course not.

438
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:28,740
But...

439
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:29,980
Mr. Xiao,

440
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:31,740
the journey is rough.

441
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,580
Lei is the one who suffered the most.

442
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,700
You don't want him to starve

443
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,660
until he's weak like just now, right?

444
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,060
Fine, one last dish.

445
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,060
All right.

446
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:45,940
I'll order at the counter.

447
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,300
Mr. Xiao, do you want to ask me something?

448
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,820
My ten silver taels are with you.

449
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,300
After paying for this meal,

450
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,180
you should give me back the balance.

451
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,380
Mr. Xiao,

452
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,340
you sure are careful.

453
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,460
So

454
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,180
why do you want to go to Dafanyin Temple?

455
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,340
Of course to see someone I want to meet.

456
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,020
Dafanyin Temple is well known.

457
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,100
It's said the Head of the Demon Sect, Ye Dingzhi,

458
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,940
made a trip to Dafanyin Temple

459
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,540
to inquire about heaven's will

460
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,100
before his expedition in the east.

461
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,700
Mr. Xiao, you know very well.

462
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,500
It's not a secret in the martial arts world.

463
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,180
Don't tell me

464
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,020
you're going to Dafanyin Temple

465
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,100
to ask for heaven's will.

466
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,020
I just need to do one thing, that's all.

467
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:56,980
What is it?

468
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:58,420
No hurry.

469
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,420
You'll know when the time comes.

470
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,300
You want to do something

471
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,260
and go all the way to find someone.

472
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:05,820
It shows that this person

473
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:06,700
has a close relationship with you.

474
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:09,620
You can say so.

475
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:10,980
Speaking of which,

476
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,460
I should call him Uncle.

477
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:18,980
These are just grudges

478
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,060
from the previous generation.

479
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:27,780
Xiao Se,

480
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,860
why don't we rent a horse?

481
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,260
If we walk on foot,

482
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,580
when are we going

483
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,340
to find a place to stay?

484
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,780
You spent all the money on food.

485
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,020
We don't have money to rent a horse.

486
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:38,900
Actually, I think

487
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,860
the place where we ate is pretty good.

488
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,940
We can rent a room

489
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,940
and make do with it.

490
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,020
That's right. Xiao Se,

491
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,340
how about we go back there?

492
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,740
An inn like that

493
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,140
charges three silver taels

494
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,140
for their worst room.

495
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,540
It's a room with no bed, no windows,
and only straws as the bedding.

496
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,900
At night, it'll be hot and humid
with mosquitoes biting you.

497
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:57,940
Can you even sleep in that kind of environment?

498
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,020
Actually...

499
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,220
I'm in the lodging business.

500
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,180
I know about this business

501
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,700
more than you do.

502
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:09,780
But...

503
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:12,900
Yes, money is saved.

00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,060

Long Arch? 100 Ghosts?

510
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,460
I've never heard of them.

511
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,140
What you used to hear

512
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,420
are stories about heroes.

513
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,220
But the Long Arch Wing Chaser

514
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,340
and the Night Parade of 100 Ghosts are different.

515
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,780
They're mounted bandits.

00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,420
Mounted bandits?

517
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,460
Wuxin, you sure are something else.

518
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,180
Even the mounted bandits are interested in you.

519
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:33,820
There are so many of them.

520
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,220
Well, I don't care about that.

521
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,780
We'll decide after we fight!

522
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:15,820
It looks like

523
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,700
they don't plan to kill.

524
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,500
What are you planning to do now?

525
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:20,860
Of course...

526
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:24,580

527
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:26,340

with liquor and dance.

532
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,100
But why are you moping around?

533
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,660
Liquor and dance?

534
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,980
I'm already a prisoner of the mounted bandits.

535
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,260
Where can I get...

536
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:58,340
That smells good.

537
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,060
Are you drinking liquor?

538
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,460
So you're drinking liquor.

539
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,500
Were you also captured by the mounted bandits?

540
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,050
Where did you get that liquor?

541
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,220
I have my ways.

542
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,140
Kid,

543
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,900
since we're fated

544
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,180
to be prisoners here,

545
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:29,900
let's drink this liquor together.

546
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:33,980
I won't be shy, then.

547
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,260
I thought

548
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,500
I was going to spend my time alone

549
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,020
drinking liquor

550
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,260
on this long night.

551
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,260
But I didn't expect

552
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,380
to run into you here.

553
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,780
You can say we're fated to meet.

554
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,500
The liquor is good.

555
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:57,860
But it's not strong enough.

556
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,340
It's not as good as the plain liquor.

557
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,260
Can you tell me

558
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,620
how you got caught by the mounted bandits?

559
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,700
My two unreliable friends

560
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,620
sold me out.

561
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:14,740
Be careful.

562
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,130
We're now

563
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:16,900
at the camp of the Long Arch Wing Chaser

564
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,300
and the Night Parade of 100 Ghosts.

565
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:19,940
If we're not careful enough,

566
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,140
we'll get caught,

567
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:22,740
let alone rescue Lei Wujie.

568
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:26,140
What's more, we don't know

569
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,180
how many experts are here.

570
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,540
With only you and me here,

571
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:29,860
how are you planning to save him

572
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,100
when I don't know martial arts at all?

573
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,700
We'll plan as we go.

574
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:36,940
We'll find a way eventually.

575
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,900
But our priority

576
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,300
is to capture someone.

577
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:41,860
So we can ask him

578
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:42,900
where Lei Wujie

579
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:43,660
is being locked up.

580
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,100
I had a good time.

581
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:49,500
Let's go star-gazing after filling our tummies.

582
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:50,580
All right.

583
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,180
Here he comes.

584
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,540
Forgive me for I'm going to sin.

585
00:29:59,060 --> 00:29:59,820
When you're ready

586
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:00,500
to answer my question,

587
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:01,660
tell me.

588
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,020
I'll pull you up.

589
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,180
I thought you know how to use the Abyssal Eye.

590
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:07,420
Why aren't you using it?

591
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:08,900
It's tiring.

592
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:14,500
Did you really grow up in Hanshui Temple?

593
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,100
Where else would I be

594
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,420
if not Hanshui Temple?

595
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,140
You have

596
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,340
the Secret Rakshasa Arts.

597
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,820
Those in the martial arts world

598
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:29,900
will definitely keep a lookout for you.

599
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,820
But not to the extent of involving

600
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,620
the powerful Wushuang City to get into fights.

601
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,700
Let alone the Tianwaitian Sect.

602
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,900
After Tianwaitian lost the battle 12 years ago,

603
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:41,900
they made a 12-year armistice

604
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,460
with the major sects

605
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:44,980
of the Central Plains.

606
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:46,860
Within 12 years,

607
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:48,860
no one from Tianwaitian

608
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,220
is allowed to enter Beili.

609
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,580
If I'm not mistaken,

610
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,300
there was

611
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,420
a five-year-old hostage at the time.

612
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:57,900
The truth

613
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,620
isn't as complicated as imagined.

614
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:01,380
All of you think

615
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,300
I'm someone important.

616
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:03,900
But

617
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,260
I'm nothing more than

618
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,540
a mischievous disciple

619
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:10,620
at Hanshui Temple.

620
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,740
I'm sorry. I was out of line.

621
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:19,140
Wuxin.

622
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:21,260
Yes?

623
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,060
If you don't pull him up,

624
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:24,540
he'll die.

625
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:25,940
Oh no!

626
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:30,940
Judging from what you said,

627
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,580
these two friends of yours

628
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:33,940
are very interesting.

629
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,060
If it weren't for them,

630
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,300
would I be so unlucky

631
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,260
and get caught here?

632
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:40,700
If I see them again next time,

633
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,140
I'm going to teach them a lesson.

634
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,260
Now, you're locked up in here.

635
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,660
I'm afraid you don't have a chance

636
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,260
to take revenge on them.

637
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:51,820
No.

638
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:53,340
At that time,

639
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,860
they indeed ran away.

640
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,180
But they did that because of urgency.

641
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,380
Why are you so sure?

642
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:04,620
Why?

643
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,500
I have a feeling. Well, it's hard to describe it.

644
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,380
Feeling?

645
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,500
Do you know

646
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,340
what kind of person Wuxin is?

647
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,020
Wuxin?

648
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,700
Isn't he Abbot Wangyou's

649
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:20,380
disciple?

650
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,820
Even if he doesn't come,

651
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,660
Xiao Se will come to save me.

652
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,140
After all, I still owe Xiao Se

653
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,340
500 silver taels.

654
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,180
We shall wait and see, then.

655
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,020
Enough about me. What about you?

656
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:39,780
Don't you have friends who can rescue you?

657
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,340
I've never had friends.

658
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,300
I don't need any either.

659
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,260
Then why

660
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,100
did you come here alone?

661
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,580
Me?

662
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:56,020
I came here

663
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,620
because I want to be the emperor!

664
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,940
You want to be the emperor?

665
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,300
Are you drunk?

666
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,300
If you become the emperor,

667
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,820
then I'm the Sword Deity.

668
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,260
All right. If I become the emperor,

669
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,020
I shall grant you that title!

670
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:19,900
It's not a title an emperor can grant.

671
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,700
You're pretty funny.

672
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:24,460
Don't worry.

673
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,340
When my friends come and rescue me,

674
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,900
we'll save you too.

675
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:30,300
Stop making so much noise!

676
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,140
Get out.

677
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:40,780
Where are you

678
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:41,460
taking him?

679
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,300
Mister, don't be scared!

680
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:45,660
My friends

681
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,380
will definitely come and save us!

682
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,220
Master, please spare me.

683
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,140
Hero, please spare me.

684
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,500
Enough begging. So tell me.

685
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,820
Where did you lock

686
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,340
the man you caught this morning?

687
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,380
I really don't know.

688
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,300
Wait, I know.

689
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:11,660
I suddenly remember where he's being locked up.

690
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,220
All the hostages we kidnapped for ransom

691
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,700
are in the dungeon.

692
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,380
How many experts are there

693
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:18,540
among the Long Arch Wing Chaser

694
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,140
and the Night Parade of 100 Ghosts?

695
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:21,620
What phase are they at?

696
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,340
The one with the best martial arts skills

697
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:25,300
is our boss.

698
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,260
But two days ago,

699
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,060
someone came to our stronghold.

700
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,820
He looks like an expert too.

701
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,820
The boss is very respectful of him

702
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:34,460
and addresses him as Mister.

703
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:37,460
Mister?

704
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:41,980
[Dungeon]

705
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:49,540
He's truly

706
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:50,980
an inexperienced lad.

707
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:52,420
Mister,

708
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,380
will that person come
and break him out of the dungeon?

709
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:56,020
Break him out?

710
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,620
He's occupied with his own trouble

711
00:34:58,620 --> 00:34:59,940
and he can't even save himself.

712
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,300
How can he break him out?

713
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,500
If he really did come,

714
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:06,020
I'd like to see him.

715
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:09,260
(After all, I haven't seen him for a long time.)

716
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,980
(The Young Head of Tianwaitian,)

717
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,740
(Ye Anshi.)

718
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:53,980
Lei Wujie.

719
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:56,540
Lei Wujie.

720
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,020
Xiao Se, I'm here.

721
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:00,460
Catch the keys.

722
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,100
I knew you'd come

723
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:09,780
and save me.

724
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:11,260
Did you drink liquor?

725
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:12,740
Yes.

726
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:14,500
There was a man

727
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,220
who was locked up next to my cell.

728
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:16,500
He was the one who gave me the liquor.

729
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,260
I even told him we'd save him.

730
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,700
But he was taken away by the guards.

731
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,500
You sure enjoy your time here.

732
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,460
You even had liquor in the dungeon.

733
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:29,820
(This)

734
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,090
(is Qiulubai liquor from Diaolou Parlor)

735
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:32,780
(in Tianqi City.)

736
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,540
(Why would someone be drinking)

737
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:35,700
(such an expensive liquor at a place like this?)

738
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:37,500
But where did he get

739
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:39,460
the liquor?

740
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,140
Right.

741
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,100
Why did he have liquor?

742
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:47,500
(Could it be...)

743
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,860
Well, enough about him.

744
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:53,220
Next,

745
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:54,500
we'll start

746
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,420
our real operation.

747
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,980
I knew with your abilities,

748
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,700
this foolish boy

749
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:00,820
wouldn't get caught

750
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:01,740
if you helped him during the day.

751
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:03,740
Yet, you let him get caught

752
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:04,940
and rescue him at night.

753
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,620
You must have other plans.

754
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:09,020
Tell me what it is.

755
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,780
The play was supposed

756
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:17,620
to have ended.

757
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,500
What do you mean, mister?

758
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,020
Tianwaitian wants to welcome

759
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,220
their young head back.

760
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:24,780
But some sects in the Central Plains

761
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,220
don't want to let him leave.

762
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:27,820
Some of them

763
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,740
are after the Secret Rakshasa Arts.

764
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,580
That's why there are so many people

765
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:32,820
fighting over the Golden Coffin.

766
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:34,820
But who would have thought

767
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,020
the weiqi piece that people are after

768
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,700
would leave the checkerboard?

769
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:42,140
A weiqi piece without discipline

770
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:45,900
will become a variable no matter where he goes.

771
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,980
If he returns to Tianwaitian,

772
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:50,660
we'll come into contact with him often

773
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:51,740
in the future.

774
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,460
So it's better to know more

775
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,260
about him.

776
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:56,540
You're right, mister.

777
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:00,300
But it won't be easy

778
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:01,780
for him to leave the checkerboard.

779
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,980
No matter how skilled his qinggong is,

780
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,100
can he stop the major power from watching him...

781
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:11,100
Wait.

782
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:12,780
I was wrong.

783
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,180
He'll surely break that kid out of the dungeon!

784
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:17,660
What's going on?

785
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:18,820
(I'm Wuxin of Hanshui Temple.)

786
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,020
(I especially come to visit)

787
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:22,300
(the Long Arch Wing Chaser
and the Night Parade of 100 Ghosts.)

788
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:23,740
Someone!

789
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,780
Hurry!

790
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:26,780
Fetch the water now!

791
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:27,820
Coming!

792
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:28,420
Move it!

793
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:29,020
Hurry!

794
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,020
Over here!

795
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:30,740
This way!

796
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:33,660
Hurry!

797
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:35,300
Someone!

798
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:36,300
Put out the fire!

799
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,100
Call for help!

800
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:37,860
Hurry!

801
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:38,820
Fetch the water now!

802
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:39,980
Stop them!

803
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,140
After them now!

804
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:47,700
Put out the fire!

805
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:48,420
Don't let them escape!

806
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,220
Stop them!

807
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,140
(It must be a coincidence.)

808
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,420
(Why would he come to a place like this?)

809
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:07,780
(Perhaps I'm overthinking.)

810
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,460
That's odd.

811
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,540
Yushi may not be big.

812
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:34,740
But it also trades with Beili.

813
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,220
There may not be an endless stream
of traveling traders.

814
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:38,980
But it shouldn't be this quiet.

815
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,300
That's right. We've walked

816
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,180
almost half a day now.

817
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,460
But we didn't see a single person here.

818
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,260
What's going on?

819
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:46,900
Don't tell me

820
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,220
something happened to Yushi.

821
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,140
But I didn't hear anything about that.

822
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,580
Is it possible
that they've changed the official route?

823
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,100
Airhead.

824
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,860
Do you think an official route

825
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,100
is easy to change as you please?

826
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:02,540
You pronounced it wrongly again.

827
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:06,220
Enough. Let's stop walking.

828
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,260
We're obviously lost.

829
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,300
Wuxin,

830
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,420
don't tell me you're bad at direction too.

831
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:14,860
I've seen the map.

832
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,370
There's only

833
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,220
one official route to Yushi.

834
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:19,500
How can we get lost

835
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:20,740
when we follow the route?

836
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:23,700
This isn't the official route.

837
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,260
This path is obviously made

838
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,140
by people who traveled on foot.

839
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,180
Why would the map mark this route?

840
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,420
You brought us here.

841
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:33,820
It's hard

842
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,500
for those who don't join cultivation in Nirvana

843
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,500
to learn from each other.

844
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:39,700
Stop showing off your literary skills.

845
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:41,980
Ordinary people lose their way,

846
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,900
and acting recklessly is an obsession.

847
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,300
There's an inn ahead!

848
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:57,900
We can just go and ask for directions.

849
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:17,540
(This is...)

850
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:20,820
