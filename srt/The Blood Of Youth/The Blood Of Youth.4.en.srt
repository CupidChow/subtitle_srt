[The Blood of Youth]

24
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,970
[Episode 4]

25
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,660
Any news of that person?

26
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:02,460
No.

27
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,700
It was chaotic last night.

28
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,580
As we were pursuing them,

29
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:07,580
we even clashed

30
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,460
with several groups of scouts.

31
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,380
We ended up...

32
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,220
He deliberately leaked his whereabouts

33
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,540
to lure us

34
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:17,460
and find our camp

35
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,860
by following the clues he found.

36
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,980
After that, he caused chaos

37
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:21,980
by surprise

38
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,580
and escaped.

39
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,220
Then he used us

40
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,860
to help him get rid of those following him.

41
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,700
Wuxin

42
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,940
sure came up with a great plot.

43
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,700
Unless we get a sword deity to make a move,

44
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,700
or else it'll be difficult to find him again.

45
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,660
Mister, should we ask...

46
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,140
We don't need to alert my father about this.

47
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:52,260
Besides, I can guess

48
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,580
where he's heading.

49
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:05,340
Anyone here?

50
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,380
Is there anyone around?

51
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,980
Are you still going to deny that we're lost?

52
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,540
This is clearly

53
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,340
an inn in Beili.

54
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,210
We went the opposite way.

55
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,460
We may have taken the wrong road.

56
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,460
But the direction is right.

57
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,100
We were heading in the west direction.

58
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,620
So how can we get lost?

59
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:42,500
(What's this?)

60
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,500
(Master?)

61
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,500
[The Sixth Prince, Xiao Chuhe,
shall be removed from the family registry]

62
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,380
[and demoted to commoner.
He shall leave the capital city immediately]

63
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:09,860
[and not return unless summoned.]

64
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:29,780
Look how heavily at it rains!

65
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:30,900
How strange it is.

66
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:47,420
Who's there?

67
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,540
Who are you?

68
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:23,940
Someone who's here to kill you.

69
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,540
I heard you've already reached
the Insouciant Phase

70
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,180
at a young age.

71
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,140
It looks to be true.

72
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,820
It's a pity

73
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,460
if you have to die like this.

74
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,380
Xiao Se.

75
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,060
This place is too dilapidated.

76
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,460
We can't stay here at all.

77
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,740
It'll be dark soon.

78
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,020
Why don't we

79
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:36,940
spend the night here

80
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:37,900
after cleaning this place up a bit?

81
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,260
Didn't you just tell me

82
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,740
we should get back on the road

83
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,140
because it's not normal

84
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,180
for an inn to appear out of a sudden?

85
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,260
I've changed my mind.

86
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,340
Xiao Se, what do you think?

87
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,620
I'm fine with it.

88
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,420
I knew you weren't asleep.

89
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,460
The mark was left

90
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,140
by Polymath of the martial arts world, right?

91
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,260
You're his disciple?

92
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,340
You can say that.

93
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,660
No wonder you know

94
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,060
so many things about the martial arts world.

95
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,660
Old Wangyou

96
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,020
once told me

97
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,540
that Polymath

98
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,340
has a disciple by the last name Xiao.

99
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,540
You should mind your own business.

100
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:08,860
I should say

101
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,420
the same to you.

102
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:11,980
Mr. Xiao,

103
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,260
remember to come back before the day breaks.

104
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,260
You really hold a grudge.

105
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:36,860
Master.

106
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,860
[Ji Ruofeng, Polymath]

107
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,220
Are you heading to Xueyue City?

108
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:52,620
Yes.

109
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,860
Do you know

110
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,780
the consequences

111
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,260
if you enter Xueyue City?

112
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,300
I heard

113
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,340
you are doing it for 500 silver taels.

114
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,060
Master, you're indeed worthy
to be called Polymath.

115
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,580
You actually found out.

116
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,100
Is it all because of 500 silver taels?

117
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,580
Anything related to silver taels

118
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,500
is important, after all.

119
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,740
All right, it's for 500 silver taels.

120
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,980
But it's not a small amount.

121
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:28,420
Can Xueyue City afford it?

122
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,220
They can't.

123
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,100
But I'm certain

124
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,820
they'd be happy

125
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,580
to help me claim the money.

126
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,100
Yes, they'd be happy indeed.

127
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,500
Not only they would,

128
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,700
any major force in the martial arts world

129
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,220
would be happy

130
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,820
to claim the 500 silver taels for you.

131
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,460
However...

132
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,460
However,

133
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,500
I'm not the only person

134
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,580
who can claim this money.

135
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:54,620
I know that.

136
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,740
You're the least advantaged one.

137
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,460
We need to fight

138
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,740
for some things.

139
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,220
If I don't try it,

140
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,700
how will I know the outcome?

141
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,860
If you fail,

142
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,980
you'll die.

143
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,180
I've died once,

144
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:15,820
haven't I?

145
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,340
Even the Sword Deity failed

146
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,220
to kill me.

147
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,700
Stop probing.

148
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,300
I already know

149
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,580
who crippled your martial arts

150
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,220
and seriously injured me that night.

151
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,700
Was it the Wrathful Sword Deity, Yan Zhantian?

152
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,180
Could it be the Lone Sword Deity, Luo Qingyang?

153
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,500
Stop guessing.

154
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,420
Since you've decided to let go,

155
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,580
stop trying to find out.

156
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,580
It's only 500 silver taels, isn't it?

157
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,660
If you compare it to life,

158
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,740
you should know

159
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,060
which one is more important.

160
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:02,820
It looks like

161
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,500
you don't have faith in me.

162
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,220
Then who do you think

163
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,860
can obtain the 500 silver taels?

164
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,500
Lord Bai, Xiao Chong?

165
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,700
Lord Chi, Xiao Yu?

166
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:21,340
I have faith in Lord Yong'an,

167
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,620
Xiao Chuhe,

168
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,700
not Xiao Se of the Snowfall Villa.

169
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,900
Are martial arts skills

170
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,260
important to you?

171
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,260
You know

172
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,580
that was not what I meant.

173
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,540
Just look at yourself.

174
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:40,580
What's wrong with me?

175
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:48,300
You are arrogant, thin-skinned, and boastful.

176
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:53,100
You show off your petty tricks,
treat others ruthlessly, and are self-righteous.

177
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,620
These are the six shortcomings
a monarch should avoid.

178
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:02,900
Master,

179
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,660
it's your turn.

180
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:07,740
I'm passing it down to you.

181
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,340
My martial arts skills are crippled.

182
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,860
How is this Wuji Staff going to be useful to me?

183
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,300
It's going to be a rough journey
to claim that 500 silver taels.

184
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,860
You can use it as a crutch.

185
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:27,860
Thank you, Master.

186
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:32,900
Master,

187
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,940
there's one thing I still can't figure out.

188
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,460
I hope you can enlighten me.

189
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:37,700
What is it?

190
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,700
I want to go to Yushi.

191
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:40,980
Can you tell me the direction?

192
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,900
Are you lost?

193
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:45,460
Yes.

194
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:50,700
Master,

195
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,180
this is not funny.

196
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,020
I thought

197
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,620
you brought those two lads to their deaths

198
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:56,980
on purpose.

199
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,500
Seek death?

200
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,060
There's a city

201
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,740
30 li to the west.

202
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:04,380
What city?

203
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:05,820
Muliang City?

204
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,660
Did I hear that correctly?

205
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,540
I can't believe

206
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,740
that we'd come here

207
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:13,700
by accident.

208
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,140
Xiao Se,

209
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,020
why don't you give

210
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:18,740
any reaction at all?

211
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,980
What kind of reaction should I have?

212
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,700
There are four major cities in this world.

213
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,460
Tianqi of the North, Xueyue of the South,

214
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,340
Wushuang of the East, and Muliang of the West.

215
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,540
It's a city as famous as Xueyue City

216
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,380
in the martial arts world.

217
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,780
I must go and visit it.

218
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,300
It's nothing but a deserted ghost city.

219
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,780
What's so special about it?

220
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,620
How can you say that?

221
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,700
Every martial artist knows

222
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,740
there is this one person living in Muliang City.

223
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,940
And this is the person

224
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,020
who made Muliang City

225
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,740
one of the four most famous cities.

226
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,100
This person is one of the Five Sword Deities,

227
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,260
Luo Qingyang, the Lone Sword Deity.

228
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,180
The Lone Sword Deity,

229
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:01,740
Luo Qingyang.

230
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,300
Enough said.

231
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,540
How would he not know

232
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,290
about rumors in the martial arts world?

233
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,340
It's said the Lone Sword Deity, Luo Qingyang,

234
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,580
lives alone in Muliang City
to practice his swordsmanship.

235
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,100
He has never left the city
for more than ten years.

236
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,260
He claims he'll only leave the city

237
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,220
after he masters

238
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:29,700
the Nine-Song Sword Technique.

239
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,250
His situation

240
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,580
is quite similar

241
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:34,860
to Lei Hong of the Lei Clan.

242
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,100
Lei Hong, Luo Qingyang,

243
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,620
and Zhao Yuzhen,

244
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,060
who has never left

245
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,300
Mount Wangcheng

246
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,220
since he was born.

247
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,540
These three people

248
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,420
are considered the three homebodies
in the martial arts world.

249
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,500
Wait, why are you...

250
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,820
But not many rumors in the martial arts world

251
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,860
are true.

252
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,100
Lei Hong and Zhao Yuzhen

253
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,020
at least have the support of the Lei Clan

254
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,180
and Mount Wangcheng respectively.

255
00:15:59,020 --> 00:15:59,940
But there's only Luo Qingyang

256
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,380
in Muliang City.

257
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,420
What has he been eating and drinking

258
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,100
for the past ten years?

259
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,180
Does he really think
his title makes him an immortal

260
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,780
who doesn't eat or drink?

261
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,060
You have a point.

262
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,140
Rumors may be exaggerated.

263
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,620
But the title of Luo Qingyang

264
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,370
as the Sword Deity is real.

265
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:17,900
Many people think

266
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,660
Luo Qingyang's martial arts skills

267
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,660
can rank first among the Five Sword Deities.

268
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,340
Lei Wujie.

269
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:26,900
Lei Wujie!

270
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:28,620
What's wrong?

271
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,140
I mean,

272
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,820
since we're already here,

273
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,460
why don't we go and take a look?

274
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:38,780
Shall we?

275
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:44,500
Master Wuchan,

276
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:45,460
how long

277
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,380
until we reach Jiulong Sect?

278
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:47,420
We're almost there.

279
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:00,060
Lian, it's sweet.

280
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,540
Here.

281
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,820
Why aren't you eating?

282
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,260
Let me feed you.

283
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,140
Tang Lian, we'll...

284
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,420
Xiao Se's face turned pale

285
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,420
when I said I was going

286
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,260
to Muliang City.

287
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,060
Wuxin is the same too.

288
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,580
What did he mean

289
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,700
by it's better not to cause trouble?

290
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,580
I only want to watch from afar.

291
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:07,660
It's not like

292
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,700
I'm going to challenge the Lone Sword Deity.

293
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,460
They're making a big deal out of this.

294
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,220
Lord Chi

295
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,420
sure is cautious.

296
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,420
He actually asked us to meet him

297
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,460
at the Western Regions' border.

298
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,140
The situation in Beili

299
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,460
is different from Nanjue's.

300
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:20,700
Their crown prince

301
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,100
has not been decided yet.

302
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:23,460
Those princes

303
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,500
who are eligible for the throne

304
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:25,980
[Fu Hengxing of Nanjue]
have been growing their powers

305
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,380
in the martial arts world in secret.

306
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,580
Other than Lord Chi, Xiao Yu,

307
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,100
there's Lord Bai, Xiao Chong.

308
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,380
Behind Lord Bai, Xiao Chong,

309
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:39,860
is Yan Zhantian, the Wrathful Sword Deity.

310
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,260
What about Lord Chi?

311
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,940
Could the Sword Deity who supports him is...

312
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:49,500
Of course it's Luo Qingyang,
the Lone Sword Deity.

313
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,300
Who's there?

314
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:04,460
Was that thunder?

315
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,620
But it doesn't look like it's going to rain.

316
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,260
That's the direction Lei Wujie went.

317
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:12,820
Could it be

318
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:14,980
he's engaging in a fight with someone?

319
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,460
This airhead

320
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,740
could cause trouble from anything.

321
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,020
This place is quite secluded.

322
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,660
To my surprise, Lei Wujie would run into people

323
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,300
who made him use his explosives.

324
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,660
They're on the move.

325
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:36,980
It looks like

326
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,860
they're heading in the direction of Muliang City.

327
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:41,700
Muliang City.

328
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:44,980
Lone Sword Deity.

329
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:57,580
What?

330
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:58,980
Aren't you going to rescue him?

331
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,340
No.

332
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:06,740
What did you say?

333
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,700
That airhead

334
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,340
won't die that easily.

335
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,340
He may have already escaped.

336
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:13,540
He'll be back here soon.

337
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,210
You may say that.

338
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:17,900
But they're heading

339
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,140
toward Muliang City.

340
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,540
If they provoked the Lone Sword Deity...

341
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,140
Didn't he want to see the Lone Sword Deity?

342
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:26,740
If he met him,

343
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,740
it would be just as he wanted.

344
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:31,900
Are you troubled by something?

345
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,420
Since you came back last night,

346
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,300
you've been a little off.

347
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,500
If you want to go, you can go alone.

348
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,940
That airhead was the one who wanted to help you.

349
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,020
I never agreed to do so.

350
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,900
I can take this chance

351
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:50,740
to split ways with you.

352
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,260
It's better for me this way.

353
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:00,900
Are you

354
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,260
scared?

355
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,220
You can go alone.

356
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:09,500
Why do you want to take someone

357
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,780
who doesn't know martial arts at all?

358
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,180
Isn't Lei Wujie your companion?

359
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,740
We only met by chance

360
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:17,860
and became acquainted, that's all.

361
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,980
His life

362
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:20,740
doesn't concern me.

363
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,180
I've been smart since I was a child.

364
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,860
I reached

365
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:29,940
the Carefree Phase when I was 13.

366
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,540
I was excited at the time

367
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:33,500
and asked Old Wangyou

368
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:34,940
if I was considered

369
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,900
a prodigy of the generation.

370
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,740
After I pestered him relentlessly,

371
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,300
he finally told me

372
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,260
there was also someone in Beili

373
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,020
who reached the Carefree Phase

374
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,460
at 13.

375
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,060
At 17, he reached the Insouciant Phase.

376
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,260
He deserves the reputation

377
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,820
of the greatest prodigy in the world.

378
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:56,940
He's the disciple

379
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,980
of Polymath of the martial arts world,

380
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,100
the Sixth Prince of Beili,

381
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,780
Xiao Chuhe.

382
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:04,700
Soon after that,

383
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,460
the incident with Lord Langya happened.

384
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,260
Li Xinyue, one of the Four Guardians of Tianqi,

385
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,660
had died.

386
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,780
(Her daughter, Li Hanyi,)

387
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,980
(pointed her sword at the Emperor,)

388
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:17,820
(which shook the martial arts world.)

389
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:21,500
(It's said Xiao Chuhe kneeled in Tianqi City)

390
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,980
(for three days and three nights)

391
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,180
(to plead mercy for Lord Langya.)

392
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,940
(Finally, he was implicated)

393
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,220
(and demoted to a commoner.)

394
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,020
At that time, I thought

395
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:32,980
Xiao Chuhe

396
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,700
may be from the imperial family.

397
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,700
But he's unexpectedly

398
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:37,820
to be a righteous person.

399
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,660
It's someone worth making friends with.

400
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,460
At first,

401
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,260
I thought you were Xiao Chuhe.

402
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:53,980
Stop pretending

403
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,700
as if you know everything.

404
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,500
You like telling stories, right?

405
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,180
I can tell you one too.

406
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,900
In the last battle
of the Demon Sect's expedition in the east

407
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:03,620
12 years ago,

408
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:06,700
every major sect in Beili

409
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,100
besieged the Head of the Demon Sect, Ye Dingzhi.

410
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,740
Ye Dingzhi was defeated

411
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:12,860
and died after he took his own life.

412
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,260
The funny thing

413
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,260
was the person who betrayed Ye Dingzhi

414
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,380
was his best friend,

415
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,340
Wang Rensun.

416
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,140
In my opinion,

417
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:24,700
Ye Dingzhi claimed himself

418
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,380
to be the greatest in the world.

419
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,660
But he eventually died
because of his friend's betrayal.

420
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,820
Utmost stupidity.

421
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,500
Why? Does that humiliate you?

422
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,100
Without using any martial arts skills,

423
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,020
I'm going to teach you a lesson.

424
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:42,940
I'm warning you.

425
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:45,540
Are you mad?

426
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,820
I'm going to rip your foul mouth!

427
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:54,500
Are you out of your mind?

428
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:04,980
(You are arrogant, thin-skinned,)

429
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:08,180
(and boastful. You show off your petty tricks,)

430
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:11,260
(treat others ruthlessly, and are self-righteous.)

431
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:14,740
(These are the six shortcomings
a monarch should avoid.)

432
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:28,500
I'm sorry.

433
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:30,580
Today,

434
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:32,780
there's no Young Head

435
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:33,700
of Tianwaitian

436
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,420
or Xiao Chuhe.

437
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,300
I'm only Wuxin from Hanshui Temple.

438
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,420
No matter what,

439
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:54,420
Lei Wujie came here

440
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:55,420
because of me.

441
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,860
So I must go and bring him back.

442
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:10,780
(And you)

443
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:14,100
(are only Xiao Se of Snowfall Villa.)

444
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,620
(I have faith in Lord Yong'an,)

445
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,020
(Xiao Chuhe,)

446
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:22,180
(not Xiao Se of the Snowfall Villa.)

447
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,220
I dare you to fight one on one.

448
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,900
Do you call yourself great for outnumbering me?

449
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,700
Rascal, cut the crap.

450
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,300
Who sent you here?

451
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,700
Just kill me if you want.

452
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,180
If I blink,

453
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,100
I'm not a hero!

454
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,340
(These people seem)

455
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,580
-(to be carrying Nanjue's long blade.)
-Untie me now!

456
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,100
-(This man does look familiar.)
-We can fight until the day turns dark.

457
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,940
(He's the Crown Prince of Nanjue's guard,)

458
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,380
(Fu Hengxing.)

459
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,260
(There must be a special reason)

460
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,460
(for him to show up here.)

461
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,020
(I think Wujie must have
overheard their conversation)

462
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:53,780
(by accident.)

463
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,020
(Why is Wuxin not here yet?)

464
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,140
Teach him a lesson.

465
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,580
You're not serious, are you?

466
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:01,740
No!

467
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:07,180
Stop!

468
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:11,140
Xiao Se!

469
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:17,940
You?

470
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,380
I didn't expect you to remember me.

471
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,260
How could I forget?

472
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:23,980
The Crown Prince

473
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,140
is still upset

474
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,580
about losing a city to you

475
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,140
at the Qianjin Gambling House
in Tianqi City back then.

476
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,260
That was the folly of youth.

477
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,620
Since you showed up here,

478
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,020
I suppose you know

479
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,340
a lot about us.

480
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,300
How's my worthless brother

481
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,700
doing now?

482
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,140
It looks like you know everything.

483
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,100
That's why you brought him to stop us.

484
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,620
What a clever strategy.

485
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,380
It's not my clever strategy.

486
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,860
After all, nothing in Beili

487
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,780
goes unnoticed by that person.

488
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:08,700
Are you here under orders?

489
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,380
I'm only here to deliver a message.

490
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:11,540
I hope you can go back

491
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,780
and tell your crown prince

492
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,420
that there are some things he can't meddle with.

493
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:23,260
I was almost tricked by you.

494
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,020
Why do you say so?

495
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,540
As far as I know,

496
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,900
you were banished from Tianqi City.

497
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,260
That information is right.

498
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,300
But matters in Tianqi City

499
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,780
are more unfathomable than you imagined.

500
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:42,460
If you don't believe me,

501
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:44,700
you can try.

502
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,420
All right.

503
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,540
I'm willing to try.

504
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,580
Why aren't you fighting?
Do you only know how to avoid my attacks?

505
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:04,740
I didn't expect

506
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,100
the prodigy of the world in the past

507
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,620
can't even hold his own weapon.

508
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,380
How tragic.

509
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:11,980
Prepare to die!

510
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:12,980
Xiao Se!

511
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:23,060
Wuxin.

512
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:24,860
Leave now.

513
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:27,820
Let's go.

514
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:29,860
When did you arrive?

515
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:32,980
It was when you started

516
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,020
confronting that person.

517
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,460
Since you were already here,

518
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,100
why didn't you make a move earlier?

519
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,620
I wanted to,

520
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,420
but you were talking

521
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,620
about the folly of youth.

522
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:43,660
I found it interesting,

523
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,220
so I decided to watch it longer.

524
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:47,620
Then,

525
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:48,780
can you untie me?

526
00:28:59,020 --> 00:28:59,340
Xiao Se,

527
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,540
you know that person?

528
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:02,780
As I listen to you talking,

529
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,300
I find it so confusing.

530
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:04,980
I don't completely understand.

531
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,620
From what he said,

532
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:07,940
you used to be an official

533
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:08,740
in Tianqi City.

534
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,260
But you were dismissed after that.

535
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:10,780
Why?

536
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,780
You also mentioned your brother.

537
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,220
What's going on?

538
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,420
Say something.

539
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,220
You obviously

540
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,300
can kill those three.

541
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,340
Why didn't you do it?

542
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,940
How can I take lives as I please?

543
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,100
If they find out they were tricked,

544
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,060
they'll definitely come back for us.

545
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,660
We should get out of here now.

546
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:32,140
You're right.

547
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,660
We should hit the road to Yushi Kingdom.

548
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:38,620
You didn't even

549
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,540
answer my questions.

550
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,980
Xiao Se, why?

551
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:47,940
[Dafanyin Temple]

552
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,380
Lingjun,

553
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:53,900
where is he now?

554
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,100
Master, the scouts reported

555
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,300
that he escaped

556
00:29:58,740 --> 00:29:59,900
from Belle's Manor several days ago.

557
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,180
During his escape, he ran into

558
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,180
the Western Regions'
most vicious mounted bandits.

559
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,620
After that, he created chaos

560
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,060
and is nowhere to be found now.

561
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:07,900
He should be

562
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:08,900
on his way here.

563
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:10,580
But...

564
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:12,660
Keep talking.

565
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,300
He's not traveling alone.

566
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:18,620
Is Tang Lian with him too?

567
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,900
He was persuaded by him?

568
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:23,340
It's not Tang Lian.

569
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:24,780
They're two young men.

570
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:26,940
One wears a red garment,

571
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,620
while the other one is the owner of an inn.

572
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,900
But we're still not clear about their identities

573
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:31,500
for now.

574
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:32,660
Master,

575
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:34,660
how did you know

576
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:35,740
he would come here?

577
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,340
He wants to meet someone here.

578
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:58,620
Wuxin.

579
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:01,900
If you don't have money

580
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,860
to spend in the Kingdom of Yushi,

581
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,460
I can lend you some.

582
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:06,860
At most, you can

583
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,100
pay me twice the amount in the future.

584
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,500
If you truly have no money,

585
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,820
you can also pay

586
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:12,780
with your secret martial arts.

587
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:14,940
But if you really

588
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:15,580
don't know the direction,

589
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:17,340
I can't help you even if I want to.

590
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,300
If we knew the direction,

591
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,620
we wouldn't have met you.

592
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:28,980
Mister, please buy one.

593
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:36,980
Stop looking. He's not a monk.

594
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,140
He can't show you the way to Dafanyin Temple.

595
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,260
He can hold his liquor, huh?

596
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,900
The pot of liquor he's drinking

597
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,380
costs two or three silver taels
in Snowfall Villa.

598
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,180
Two or three silver taels?

599
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,660
How many jars of plain liquor
I can buy with that much money?

600
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,260
Found you.

601
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:08,180
[Wang Rensun, Shattering Blade]

602
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:16,900
An expert indeed.

603
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,060
Don't just stay here. Go after them.

604
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:25,620
You're right.

605
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:38,500
Abbot.

606
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,060
Abbot Falan,

607
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,220
it has been more than ten years

608
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,940
since we bade farewell in Tianqi City.

609
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,220
How have you been?

610
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:49,420
How dare you?

611
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:50,500
No matter.

612
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,860
Abbot is not being disrespectful.

613
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,180
He just can't speak.

614
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:56,540
Abbot,

615
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:59,060
I'm here to seek a person.

616
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:02,780
I have a letter

617
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,140
written by the Lord of Yushi.

618
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:08,580
Twelve years ago,

619
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,900
the Head of Demon Sect, Ye Dingzhi,

620
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,620
came to see your master,

621
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:13,780
The Venerable One,

622
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,140
to inquire about heaven's will.

623
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:17,380
No matter how Ye Dingzhi threatened him

624
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,340
with his sword,

625
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,940
The Venerable One only shook his head silently.

626
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,020
We'll put aside the Buddhist doctrine.

627
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,940
You surely have
the demeanor of The Venerable One

628
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,540
when you shake your head silently.

629
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:30,540
Abbot,

630
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,500
you've helped that person hide

631
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,460
for 12 years.

632
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:35,500
This time,

633
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,620
you can't hide him anymore.

634
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:43,420
[Dafanyin Temple]

635
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,100
Why aren't we on the move?

636
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,180
We're already here.

637
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,460
What is all this noise?

638
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:58,820
Why are there

639
00:33:59,180 --> 00:33:59,940
so many people coming here today?

640
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:01,660
What are they doing here?

641
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:03,500
Kick them out!

642
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:04,580
Kick them out!

643
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,060
Martial Brother,

644
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,580
who's this person?

645
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,220
The Slumber Luohan Fist.

646
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,460
This isn't the Slumber Luohan Fist.

647
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,060
He's just drunk.

648
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:16,340
Why did you come back here again?

649
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,020
Falan.

650
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,300
Dafanyin Temple doesn't have any rules

651
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,380
that forbid me from visiting him.

652
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,140
How competent

653
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,220
can a drunkard be?

654
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,740
It's a pity to see Precept Breaking Blade

655
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:34,180
in your hand.

656
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:00,980
Falan,

657
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:02,660
stop shaking your head.

658
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,820
We can't avoid the inevitable.

659
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,860
Since we can't, we'll just kill them.

660
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,780
It's been 12 years since we last met,

661
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,340
Wang Rensun, the Shattering Blade.

662
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,460
Oh,

663
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,220
so you're the effeminate

664
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:26,260
Eunuch Jade Deity, the Directorate of Incense.

665
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,900
Directorate of Incense?

666
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:31,020
It's true

667
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,020
that people will meet again after a farewell.

668
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:35,380
Oh, Wuxin.

669
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:36,860
Why are there always experts

670
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,460
wherever you go?

671
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:39,460
And they're always

672
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:40,740
picking a fight.

673
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,500
Are these experts

674
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:43,380
going to fight?

675
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,260
You know the Lei Clan

676
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,620
is a well-known family in the martial arts world.

677
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,700
How come they have

678
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:49,380
an airhead like you?

679
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:50,540
That's not how you pronounce it.

680
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:51,060
Airhead.

681
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,100
No, it's not.

682
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:52,660
Airhead.

683
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,100
Since you're here,

684
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,100
you can get down from there.

685
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:01,100
Did they

686
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:01,740
notice us?

687
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:02,700
Shut up.

688
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,220
Thank you for coming all the way

689
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:12,220
to see me, Directorate of Incense.

690
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:13,700
I feel honored.

691
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:31,260
Directorate.

692
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:33,460
Don't address me that way.

693
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,300
Only the one in the palace

694
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,260
can address me as such.

695
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,300
Eunuch Jade Deity.

696
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,540
I'm not used to you

697
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,100
being so respectful.

698
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,540
Where is the friend in white

699
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,060
who argued with me about tea tasting that year?

700
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,540
You came to see me for tea tasting.

701
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:58,100
But you're here to capture me now.

702
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,380
I have to follow the order

703
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:01,340
of the one in the palace.

704
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,580
But I can still

705
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,540
keep you alive.

706
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,100
You can stop there.

707
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:14,940
All the way,

708
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:18,340
Xueyue City, Jiulong Sect,

709
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,940
Wushuang City, and Tianwaitian

710
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,860
had come to me.

711
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,300
Every single one of them said

712
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,140
they wouldn't kill me.

713
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,340
So the condition you offered

714
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,700
is not special at all.

715
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:34,980
Be it Xueyue City

716
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:37,300
or Wushuang City,

717
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,460
the power that I'm representing

718
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:41,340
is different from theirs.

719
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:44,380
If I can't take you with me this time,

720
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:47,020
I'll not hesitate to kill you.

721
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,340
Eunuch Jade Deity, don't go too far.

722
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,140
If you want to kill him,

723
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,660
you have to go through me first!

724
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:00,940
You...

725
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,140
Why?

726
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:04,740
This time,

727
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,180
you can't do it?

728
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,940
Eunuch Jade Deity is here for me.

729
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,340
We'll talk about what happened between us

730
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:22,940
later.

731
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,780
The drunk man

732
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,180
looks like

733
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,020
an expert.

734
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,460
If I'm not mistaken,

735
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,380
the person Wuxin wants to meet is him.

736
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,740
Do you mean the old friend Wuxin mentioned?

737
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,140
It's just an old score
from the previous generation.

738
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,540
Please brandish your sword.

739
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:02,260
Shen Jingzhou's Blizzard Sword.

740
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:02,780
Wuxin,

741
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:04,900
I heard you've learned

742
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,700
many strange martial arts skills.

743
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,660
What are you planning to use this time?

744
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,540
Great Soul Seeker?

745
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,060
You even mastered the martial arts skills

746
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:35,980
of the Great Sorrow.

747
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:44,460
Zhou'er.

748
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,420
(Eunuch Jade Deity, what's the matter?)

Break!

751
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:05,020
Shen Jingzhou's Blizzard Sword

752
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:06,980

754

755
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:12,060
in the martial arts world.

756
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:15,300
Wuxin is also 17 now.

00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:18,820

758
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:20,980
I ask you one last time.

759
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,740
Are you coming with me?

760
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,660
It's a pity

761
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,780
to kill someone as interesting as you.

762
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:30,780
It's not easy to kill me.

763
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:39,180
(This is bad.)

764
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:51,100
Zhou'er.

765
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,460
