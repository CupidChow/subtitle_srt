26
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:56,960
Don't make it sound like

27
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:57,760
I'm useless.

28
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,350

Why?

31
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,480
Because of me.

32
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:06,510
You only sent Baixiao Sect

33
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:07,430
to intercept Lord Chi.

34
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,320
How would that be enough?

35
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:10,480
That's why you're so much

36
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:11,550
earlier than expected.

37
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,230

38
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:15,280

Look at you.

Sit down.

50
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,600
I was thinking about it last night.

51
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:52,160
And I finally figured it out.

52
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,160
You didn't let me go

53
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,040
because you were afraid

54
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,160
I'd be in danger, right?

55
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,000
Yes. You've been in danger

56
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,550
too many times because of me.

57
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,070

will be over soon.

59
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:07,880
And you can go back

60
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,110
to Xueyue City without worries then.

61
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,070
But you saw it too.

62
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:13,280
If it weren't for me,

63
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,040
you'd all have been in danger.

If you leave me out again,

00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,110
I will really get mad.

66
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,040
You know what happens when I get mad.

67
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:25,230
You will be in

68
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,040
even more danger then.

00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,670

it's fine.

80
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,160
Near Lord Chi's Residence yesterday,

as well as Fairy Rui of Xueyue City,

85
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,480
joined forces and ambushed the Leader.

102
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,080

103
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,310
the fake news that the envoy of Nanjue

104
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,190
had entered Tianqi City,

105
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,160
it means he already knew

106
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,400
that I was in contact with Ao Yu.

107
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,040
In that case,

108
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,230
we have to speed things up.

109
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,280

110
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:53,350

that when is the best time?

114
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,520

116
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:04,640
So, the second letter

117
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:05,870
will be sent to Muliang City.

118
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,280
Why did you call me back

119
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:50,720
so urgently?

120
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,840

Given his speed,

129
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,790
won't he reach Tianqi soon?

Luo Qingyang is Lord Chi's godfather.

131
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,920
Lord Chi must've asked him to come.

132
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,600
Looks like Lord Chi

133
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,840
wants to fall out completely,

134
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,640
so he's asked Lone Sword Deity to attack the city.

135

he is only stronger.

140
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,600
But Luo Qingyang

141
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,310
is aloof and arrogant.

142
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,350
He won't obey Lord Chi easily.

143
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:39,920

144
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,670
to take someone away.

145
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,480

146
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,640

00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:24,160
a major helper?

191
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:26,310
If the news is true

192
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:27,840
and Wushuang can really

193
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,750
manipulate Wushuang Sword Box completely,

194
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,070
then he still has a chance

195
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:34,000
to defeat Lone Sword Deity.

196
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,590
I wonder what they will do.

197
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:38,280
They?

198
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:39,950
I'm sure Chuhe

199
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,830
is trying to figure something out too.

200
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,710
Who dares to come to Xueyue City to cause trouble?

201
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,280
Are you that young city lord

202
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:01,040
of Wushuang City?

203
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,520
Just City Lord.

204
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,790
Why did you add the word "young"?

205
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,160
You really are Song Yanhui's darn disciple.

206
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,310
Take this!

207
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,790
(This man's swordsmanship is superb.)

208
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,640
(I can't believe he's as good as Master.)

209
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:20,830
(Is this the legendary)

210
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:21,400
(Sword Wielding Arts?)

211
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,550
(I've only just learned the art of Liubo.)

212
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,190
(I have yet to master it.)

213
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,040
(I am afraid I am no match for him.)

214
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:27,640
Stop.

215
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,160
City Lord Wushuang,

216
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:40,880
did you come to Xueyue City

217
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,240
to seek a battle with me?

218
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,590
I've been looking forward to it.

219
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:47,190
Cloud, Frost, Wind,

220
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,160
Shadow, Slaughter, Ordeal Breaker,

221
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,950
Red Leaf, Butterfly, Thread,

222
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:51,670
Jade,

223
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:52,880
go!

224
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,280
I'm afraid these ten flying swords

225
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,920
are not enough.

226
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:01,670
What about two more?

227
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:03,360
Boundless, Vast.

228
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,640
City Lord Sikong, what do you think now?

229
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,160
You have a chance to fight,

230
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,710
but no chance of victory.

231
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,160
I see.

232
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,240
Then I will fight first,

233
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,640
then find a chance to win.

234
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:20,950
Thank you, City Lord Sikong.

235
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,280
Did you come to Xueyue City

236
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,670
just to show me

237
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:24,470
flying swords?

238
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,640
I have been ordered to go to Tianqi.

239
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:27,950
I don't know if I can return,

240
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:30,120
so I want to fulfill some wishes.

241
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,710
I've come to Xueyue City

242
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,280
to see you

243
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:34,760
and learn about my current strength.

244
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:35,880
Second,

245
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:37,880
I'm here to see Fairy Luoxia.

246
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:38,710
Me?

247
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:41,190
Why do you want to see me?

248
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,310
About this,

249
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,590
my master has given up

250
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,240
the pursuit of the sword deity title.

251
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,160
He is living in seclusion in the sword cottage

252
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,430
at the back of Mount Wushuang.

253
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,830
He said he had thought things through.

254
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,280
If you are willing to,

255
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:55,950
he'd like to invite you
to Wushuang City for a meeting.

256
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:58,360
A meeting your foot!

257
00:10:58,590 --> 00:10:58,790
You...

258
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,920
Calm down. Calm down.

259
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:04,590
♪The snow falls into the mortal world♪

260
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,000
Master,

261
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:06,520
you can't agree to this.

262
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,470
That shameless guy

263
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,280
obviously wants

264
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:10,190
to get you back.

265
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,400
Master. You can't go, Master.

266
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:13,830
So what if I go with him?

267
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:17,660
♪All that time wasted
only to wait for that one person♪

268
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,280
I won't go with him.

269
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,070
What am I going to do if you leave?

270
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:21,830
You are not a child anymore.

271
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,880
You can live without me.

272
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,470
It's exactly because

273
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,190
I'm not a child anymore.

274
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:26,520
So...

275
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,830
So, whatever Song Yanhui can give you,

276
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,760
I can give you as well.

277
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:34,760
What is he...

278
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:35,280
What is he doing?

279
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:35,920
What is he talking about?

280
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:36,670
What is he...

281
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,280
Are you confessing to her?

282
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,830
You are not a child anymore.

283
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:45,590
What the adult can offer, you can offer it too.

284
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,470
Why does that sound

285
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,590
a little strange to me?

286
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,470
Did you hit your head?

287
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,280
No.

288
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:54,880
A beauty like you

289
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,670
is around me every day.

290
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,120
If that didn't make me feel anything,

291
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,160
I wouldn't be in my right mind then.

292
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,190
I am your master.

293
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:06,000
That's why people say

294
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,920
first come, first served.

295
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,920
Keep the goodies within one's own people.

296
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:14,950
I have a poor memory,

297
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:16,880
but I don't think this is the right scenario
to apply that saying.

298
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:18,880
I knew something

299
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,040
was off with you, you brat,

300
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,160
but I just didn't expect

301
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,520
you had got the nerve

302
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,120
to talk to the Fairy like this.

303
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,240
Do you know

304
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,360
how many young talents confessed

305
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,710
to the Fairy like this back then?

306
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,240
They were all beaten away by her.

307
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:31,310
But you do

308
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:32,190
have a point.

309
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:33,710
What's wrong?

310
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,550
Why can't a disciple

311
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:36,670
be in a relationship with his master?

312
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,070
Shut up.

313
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:44,640
Tell him

314
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:45,880
I'm not going.

315
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:48,040
One can only

316
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,000
wait for some things once in a lifetime.

317
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,710
Since he gave it up last time,

318
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,310
there is no more.

319
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,000
Master, well said!

320
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:55,760
This is great!

321
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,190
Brat.

322
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:58,310
Shut up.

323
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,670
It seems that swallows will return one day,

324
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,070
but love won't.

325
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,000
I feel sorry for my master.

326
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:08,760
Farewell.

00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:18,210
[Xianyun Tavern]

328
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:27,590
Sir.

329
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,310
Do you still serve food now?

330
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,120
Sorry, sir.

331
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,310
The kitchen is closed.

333
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,360
still has some food.

334
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,590
Please don't, sir. Please...

335
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:47,400
Miss,

336
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,760
I'm feeling hungry from all the traveling.

337
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,400
Can you share some food with me?

338
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:52,880
You know,

339
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,590
even my closest peers

340
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:55,710
do not dare

341
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:56,880
to eat with me.

342
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,070
Why?

343
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,400
Because I'm good at poisoning.

344
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,670
Every cup of liquor you drink

345
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,470
could be deadly poison.

346
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,160
It's fine.

347
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:08,310
Waiter.

348
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,160
Coming, sir.

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:16,590
Here's your cup.

350
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,240
Interesting.

00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,470
The moon is so beautiful tonight.

352
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:32,790
You're sitting here drinking alone.

353
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,590
Are you thinking about something sad?

354
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:38,070
How interesting.

355
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:39,950
Young City Lord of Wushuang City.

356
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:41,760
You know me?

357
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,670
I recognize your sword box.

358
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,120
Do you know who I am?

359
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:48,240
I have a poor memory.

360
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:49,950
Yuzhai has probably told me,

361
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,040
but I don't remember it.

362
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,240
I'm the head of the Dark River Mu family,

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,470
Mu Yumo.

364
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,590
I see.

365
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,950
I've heard that there are many beautiful women
in the Mu family of Dark River.

366
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,280
Looks like the rumors are true.

367
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,520
You are such a lovely

368
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,040
child.

369
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,000

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,120
one cun

371
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:07,920
closer to you,

372
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:08,950
you will break

373
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:09,920
my arms and legs, won't you?

374
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:11,550
You can try.

375
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,120
I'm not taking the risk.

376
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,760
Come on, Yumo.

377
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:19,880
Let's have a drink.

378
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,040
Let's talk

379
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:22,240
about the man in your eyes.

380
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,880
The man in my eyes?

381
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,070
What kind of person is he

382
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,120
that you can't forget him?

383
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,160
Have you ever heard of this poem?

384
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,360
As the music flows upon the moon
reflected on the water's surface,

385
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:46,550
the breeze and the cloud are caught up.

386
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:48,760
In the Pipa City of Nine Rivers,

387
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,760
he became famous for his three hidden weapons.

388
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:53,670
Tang Lianyue of the Tang Clan,

389
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,360
a master swordsman on the Top-Rank List.

390
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:56,400
That's right.

391
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,120
Back then,

392
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:59,360
everyone knew who he was.

393
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:03,040
Even after years of retirement,

394
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,070
he is still the head of the Tang Clan

395
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,880
when he made a comeback.

396
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:08,520
Yumo,

397
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,920
I'd like to hear about how you met each other.

398
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,670
How we met each other...

399
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,790
Our encounter began

400
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:22,280
when I tried to kill him the first time.

401
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,430
The first time?

402
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,070
I tried to kill him three times.

403
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:29,280
The first time, he and I...

404
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,470
I kind of miss him now.

405
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:50,240
It's all over.

406
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,000
You can go see him anytime.

407
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,830
It's all over?

408
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,240
Changhe's body

409
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:58,430
is in the carriage outside.

410
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:00,160
We will send him back to Dark River.

411
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:01,710
Then, we will dissolve Dark River.

412
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:02,760
After that,

413
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:04,400
everyone can do

414
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,750
what they want to do.

415
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,230
You are Su Muyu, the head of the Su family.

416
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:13,880
You recognize him, but not me.

417
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,120
Your 18 Swords Formation is incredible.

418
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:18,430
I'd like to see it.

419
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,030
Your swords are good,

420
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:23,270
while mine is only a killing weapon.

421
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:24,920
It's not worth seeing.

422
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,400
Dark River has withdrawn

423
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,360
from the fray.

424
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,160
This battle between me and you

425
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,320
is unnecessary.

426
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,190
Yumo,

427
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:35,470
let's go.

428
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:45,710
Wushuang,

429
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,950
next time we meet,

430
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:50,080
I hope to hear your story too.

431
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:51,670
Remember

432
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:52,880
to visit me in Wushuang City then.

433
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,320
You're asking the head of a family of Dark River
to go to visit you?

434
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,880
That's very cute, Wushuang.

435
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:01,160
Just like what this gentleman said,

436
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,920
you won't be Dark River members anymore soon.

437
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,950
Since you are not Dark River members,

438
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,920
the killing weapon that he said

439
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,080
will become a sword.

440
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:10,880
I look forward to fighting with you, Mr. Su.

441
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:14,270
You are going to Tianqi, aren't you?

442
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,710
Yes, Tianqi.

443
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,560
There are many good swords in Tianqi City.

444
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,710
This trip won't disappoint you.

445
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,600
You will even see

446
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:26,230
the best sword in the world.

447
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:27,880
The best sword?

448
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:34,030
[Lianyue Pavilion]

449
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:35,640
The City Lord of Wushuang City

450
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,800
has gone to Xueyue City alone.

451
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,080
I've heard

452
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:39,160
that the new young city lord

453
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,430
has already mastered

454
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,600
Wushuang Sword Box.

455
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,270
Rumors say

456
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,990
that he's there to challenge Sikong Changfeng.

457
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,560
That's impossible.

458
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:49,840
Wushuang City has no reason

459
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,230
to make a move on Xueyue City.

460
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:53,920
Those from the martial arts world

461
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,230
think they know

462
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,510
what the two city lords are thinking.

463
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,950
How preposterous.

464
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,430
Speaking of city lords,

465
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:01,510
another city lord has left his city too.

466
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,320
He is going to Tianqi.

467
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,840
He is Lord Chi's godfather.

468
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,160
He's going to Tianqi

469
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:10,230
to support Lord Chi.

470
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:12,320
As for Xueyue City,

471
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,990
their Principal City Lord has yet to return.

472
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:15,470
Their Second City Lord is severely injured.

473
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,470
Their Third City Lord
can't leave due to the tension

474
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:18,400
in the martial arts world.

475
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,400
No one can go and help them.

476
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,430
Says who?

477
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,120
Tang Clan can go and help them.

478
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:26,560
Tang Clan?

479
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,950
We have no chance

480
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:31,160
of making peace with Lei Fortress for now,

481
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,510
but the alliance with Xueyue City

482
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:35,160
can't be given up so easily.

483
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:37,880
Besides, I am expecting big things

484
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,640
from that young man named Xiao Se.

485
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,670
The moon is bright tonight.

486
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,080
Let's depart.

487
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,680
[Snowfall Villa]

488
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:51,990
What are you doing here?

489
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,270
Didn't you say you would stay

490
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,120
in your room to heal?

491
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:55,400
That's right.

492
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:56,470
I was going

493
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:57,470
to deliver breakfast to you.

494
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,160
It's just a minor injury.

495
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,030
It's not a big deal.

496
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:00,800
Eat your food.

497
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,080
Why are you here too?

498
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:07,640
Because he is here.

499
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,840
[Tianqi City]

500
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,880
What's wrong with this man?

501
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:14,160
He's been standing here for a long time.

502
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:15,160
-That's right.
-Leave it.

503
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:15,990
Let's go. Come on.

504
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:16,470
Mind our own business.

505
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,840
Lone Sword Deity, Luo Qingyang,

506
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,750
is a disciple of Tianqi's Shadow Sect,

507
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,950
secret bodyguards of the imperial family.

508
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,360
After the fall of Shadow Sect,

509
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,160
there are only two Shadow disciples

510
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:34,990
left in the world.

511
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:36,920
The other one

512
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,800
is Consort Xuan?

513
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:39,990
That's right.

514
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:41,800
Luo Qingyang

515
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,160
was the most brilliant disciple in Shadow Sect.

516
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,600
Later, he became the late Emperor's
personal secret bodyguard.

517
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,360
He saved the late Emperor many times.

518
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,560
The late Emperor rewarded him with a city

519
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,600
before his death in recognition of his merits.

520
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:55,600
Luo Qingyang chose Muliang City,

521
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,030
the most desolate city in the west.

522
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:58,920
It is said that it was

523
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,080
to practice his Melancholy Sword.

524
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:01,990
Melancholy Sword?

525
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:03,670
That's right.

526
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,430
His life is melancholy.

527
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,360
He was born an orphan.

528
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,120
All of his martial siblings are dead.

00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,470
The woman he loves married twice,

530
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,080
but it has nothing to do with him.

531
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,710
Isn't his life melancholy?

[Tianqi City]

533
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,320
What is going on?

534
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,950
You're saying that he chopped off

535
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,320
the plaque of Tianqi City

536
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:42,990
with his sword?

537
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:43,750
Yes.

538
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:44,920
Captain Luo

539
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,430
took the plaque down with his sword.

540
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,430
Then, he took it

541
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,400
to Qianjin Gambling House.

542
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:49,230
Everyone in Qianjin Gambling House

543
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:50,270
was so scared that they ran away.

544
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,990
Even Second Master Tu ran away.

545
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:55,920
The plaque of Tianqi City

546
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,190
has been taken down three times.

547
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,030
The first time

548
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,470
was when Xiao Yi, the first emperor of Beili,

549
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:01,640
broke open the city gate.

550
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,670
As the qi of his sword was too powerful,

551
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:04,600
he struck it down at once.

552
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,470
The second time

553
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:07,640
was 60 years ago when Baiyu Sword Deity

554
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:08,600
saved the disciple

555
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:09,640
who was being held hostage.

556
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:10,710
He struck it down

557
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,560
as a warning to the people of Tianqi City.

558
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,160
This is the third time.

559
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:16,880
Why did he take

560
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,880
the plaque to Qianjin Gambling House?

561
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:21,840
He did so because that place

562
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,840
has people from all levels of society.

563
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,190
They will spread

564
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,270

What else did he say besides chopping down

567
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,560
the plaque?

568

He didn't say anything at all.

In the end,

he heaved the plaque into the ground

this is Lone Sword Deity, Luo Qingyang,
we are talking about.

592
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,390
I've known him for ten years.

593
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:19,830
I know what kind of person he is...

He isn't a person.

He's a monster.

596
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:23,980
I asked imperial guards and Tiger Soldiers

597
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,060
to surround him

If he enters this palace,

00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:30,630
will I be able to stop him?

Let me tell you,

610
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:50,950
if he had really come to kill my brother,

611
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,390
he wouldn't have taken the plaque down

612
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,590
and yelled something about

614
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,740
He would've just killed his way into the palace.

Challenge Tianqi to sword fights.

616
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,190
The meaning of this phrase

617
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:04,300
is not simple.

618

00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:00,020
in a good mood.

755
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:01,670
Mr. Xie.

756
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,460
I just asked Luo Qingyang

757
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:08,740
about the purpose of his visit to Tianqi City.

758
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,870
He said he would challenge Tianqi
to sword fights for three days.

759
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,350
Three days later,

760
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:14,870
he will take someone away

761
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:16,460
and kill someone.

762
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,430
The one he wants to take away

763
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,020
must be his younger martial sister,

764
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:20,910
Consort Xuan.

765
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:23,670
As for the one he wants to kill...

766
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:27,830
I'm guessing that it's me.

767
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:29,020
What?

768
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:30,830
He wants to kill Xiao Se?

769
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,300
Is this show

770
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:33,780
still fun to watch?

771
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:35,060
We will go back now.

772
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,430
I will ask Ji Xue to send a letter to Xueyue City.

773
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:37,700
I will ask my father to come to help us.

774
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:38,670
Take it easy.

775
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,430
We still have three days.

776
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,350
Xiao Se!

777
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:42,460
Xiao Se...

778
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:45,910
You've guessed it already, haven't you?

779
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:48,950
Let's watch the battle first.

780
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,540
Challenging Tianqi's swordsmen for three days
is a ploy to put pressure on us,

781
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,220
proving that he is already invincible

782
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,060
in the world.

783
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:56,830
After three days,

784
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:57,780
whatever he wants to do,

785
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:58,980
no one will be able to stop him

786
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:00,500
or stand in his way.

787
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,300
Looks like Wrathful Sword Deity

788
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,390
isn't just here to ask for a sword challenge.

789
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:06,830
He has also borne

790
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:08,220
the expectations of Lord Bai.

791
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:10,540
If he can defeat Luo Qingyang,

792
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,740
then Luo Qingyang's invincibility

793
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:13,780
would be a joke.

794
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,980
He won't be able to take away
the one he wants to take away

795
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:17,830
and kill the one he wants to kill.

796
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:19,740
Master,

797
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,500
why hasn't Yan Zhantian made his move?

798
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:24,390
Yan Zhantian's Wrathful Sword Technique

799
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:25,300
has only three moves.

800
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,060
Draw the sword with wrath,

801
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:28,060
strike with wrath,

802
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,390
and withdraw it with wrath.

803
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,140
He won't use

804
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,590
the Wrathful Sword Technique easily

805
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:34,390
against unnecessary opponents.

806
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:36,870
But for an opponent

807
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:37,590
like Luo Qingyang,

808
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,220
he has to use the Wrathful Sword Technique.

809
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,740
Since he can only use these three moves,

810
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:44,300
he

811
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,740
has to build up strength.

812
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:49,110
Here it comes.

813
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:58,350
Luo Qingyang wants to defeat Yan Zhantian

814
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,350
without drawing his sword.

815
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:00,670
How arrogant.

816
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:01,980
Draw your sword!

817
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:09,110
This is what Yan Zhantian looks like

818
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,670
when his wrath is at its peak.

819
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,060
What

820
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,060
a great duel.

821
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:49,260
But who won?

822
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:52,590
Good question. Who won?

823
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:56,220
He has fought hundreds of battles

824
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,390
and has fought with one sword
against millions of soldiers.

825
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:02,190
It's tacky to judge this duel as victory or defeat.

826
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:09,630
Master!

827
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:12,630
Thank you, Master.

828
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,500
He's better than me.

829
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:16,700
Chong'er,

830
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:20,870
I couldn't help you this time.

831
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:21,780
It's fine.

832
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,910
I'm just glad you're not hurt.

833
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:25,350
Master,

834
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:26,590
my men

835
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:27,390
will take you back to rest.

836
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,190
What about you?

837
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:30,350
I will stay and watch.

838
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:33,630
Be careful.

839
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:39,910
After this battle,

840
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,870
Lord Bai's Residence in Tianqi City

841
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,780
will never be the same again.

842
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:46,670
I never thought Lord Bai

843
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:47,950
would be the one to make the first move.

844
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,740
There are several reasons why he did that.

845
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:52,300
In the Imperial Court,

846
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:53,980
the senior officials

847
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:54,830
who were supporting Lord Bai

848
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,190
have begun to waver

849
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:57,350
because of Xiao Chuhe's return.

850
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:59,950
His biggest helper in the inner hall,

851
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:00,670
Director of Record,

852
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:02,150
has been killed by the Director.

853
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:04,220
The Tang Clan

854
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:05,950
no longer supports him in the martial arts world.

855
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:07,870
If Lord Bai

856
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,750
had won this battle,

857
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:12,100
then Lord Bai's Residence,

858
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:14,140
which has the strongest protector in the world,

859
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:16,710
would've turned things around.

860
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:17,580
Didn't Lord Bai

861
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,580
realize that?

862
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:21,460
Lord Bai is not a fool,

863
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,060
but he is also a fool.

864
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,830
He actually began

865
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:27,350
to care about

866
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:29,100
his vain brotherhood with Xiao Chuhe.

867
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:34,310
He made the first move
because he didn't want to give my godfather

868
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,140
the chance to kill Xiao Chuhe.

869
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:41,580
Lei Wujie, don't be reckless.

870
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:44,270
I...

871
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:46,350
My two sword deity masters aren't here.

872
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,230
I'll challenge Luo Qingyang

873
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:47,830
on their behalf.

874
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:48,710
What's wrong with that?

875
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:49,950
Besides,

876
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,540
doesn't he want to kill Xiao Se?

877
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:54,100
He can't be allowed to be that cocky.

878
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:55,310
It's not time

879
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:56,390
for you to play the hero yet.

880
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:59,020
I'm Wushuang from Wushuang City.
I have come to challenge you!

881
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:03,790
Wushuang!

882
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:05,500
We met again.

883
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:06,910
You have to fight well.

884
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,060
Don't worry. I will do my best.

885
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:15,750
I heard Wushuang City

886
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,430
has a new city lord,

887
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:18,980
who is young and talented.

888
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,350
I didn't expect

889
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:22,540
he could be so young.

890
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:23,910
I didn't expect

891
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,180
that even the City Lord of Wushuang

892
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,950
has come to Tianqi City.

893
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:30,100
I invited him.

894
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:36,500
You asked Wushuang to enter the city

895
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:37,870
because you think

896
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:39,020
he can beat Luo Qingyang?

897
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:40,950
Wushuang City has been waiting

898
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:41,540
for a chance.

899
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:45,180
I'm waiting for a chance too.

900
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:48,140
Please enlighten me, sir.

901
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,870
It's an honor to see

902
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:53,710
Wushuang Sword Box.

903
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:55,950
You know about Wushuang Sword Box too?

904
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,830
People say I was born to be a swordsman.

905
00:35:59,100 --> 00:35:59,950
Some people also say...

906
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:02,660
We will talk with swords.

907
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:03,580
Sure!

908
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,660
Twelve flying swords.

909
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:14,390
Wushuang City finally has a sword deity

910
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:16,620
after a century.

911
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,020
I'm flattered, sir. Go!

912
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:44,140
The Flying Sword Technique

913
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:45,910
is indeed a wonderful sword art,

914
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:47,580
but as a swordsman,

915
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:49,660
if you don't hold

916
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:51,620
a sword in your hand,

917
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,350
you are still

918
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:54,870
a bit short of the mark.

919
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:56,750
If you had borrowed your master's

920
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:58,100
Water Breaking Sword,

921
00:36:58,980 --> 00:36:59,390
you

922
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:02,580
might have lasted longer.

923
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:04,230
I have a sword

924
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:05,950
that I hold in my hand.

925
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:16,620
The Vermilion!

926
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:20,910
What is he doing?

927
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,270
The Vermilion

928
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:23,500
and the twelve flying swords

929
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:24,950
were made by the Ghost Swordsmith.

930
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:26,390
They need to be fed with blood.

931
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,020
Therefore, the Vermilion

932
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,620
has another name...

933
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:30,500
The Devil Sword.

934
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,310
It really is a good sword.

935
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:35,620
Kill Wushuang.

936
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:36,910
I want this sword.

937
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:40,790
Oh no.

938
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:49,540
Wushuang failed

939
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:50,500
to control the Vermilion.

940
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,500
Instead, the sword has taken control.

941
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:53,710
There is no way

942
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,620
that I would be controlled by a sword.

943
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,620
What do you think, Mr. Luo?

944
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:02,350
It's a good move. It's worth drawing my sword.

945
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:19,660
Look at Luo Qingyang!

946
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,060
This is...

947
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:25,710
Martyr Sword Dance.

948
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,660
Why do I feel sad watching him

949
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:33,140
draw his sword?

950
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,750
Martyr Sword,

951
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,580
the best technique of Melancholy Sword,

952
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:41,230
is Luo Qingyang's strongest move.

953
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,180
What does Martyr mean?

954
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:45,710
Those who die without courage
on the battlefield

955
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,540
(are not allowed to be coffined)

956
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:48,750
(and buried in the cemetery.)

957
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:50,060
(They are called)

958
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:51,460
(ghosts without a master.)

959
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:54,100
(Do you know)

960
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:55,270
(why Luo Qingyang)

961
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:56,830
(chose Muliang City?)

962
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:58,230
(In the past, 100,000 soldiers)

963
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,580
were killed in Muliang City,

964
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,180
which is the most powerful gate in the west.

965
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:04,140
Their country was defeated

966
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:05,430
and they retreated in a hurry,

967
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:06,950
leaving the bodies

968
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:09,140
of those who had died in battle uncollected

969
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:10,350
in the wilderness

970
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:14,060
until they turned into ashes 100 years later.

971
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:16,980
(This is called Martyr.)

972
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,020
What melancholy

973
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,060
can be greater than the melancholy of a nation?

974
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,310
Is this the legendary sword tendency?

975
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:37,870
Then I will break the Nine-Song

976
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:39,540
and the melancholy!

977
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:00,870
It's an honor for Wushuang City

978
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:03,140
to have a disciple like you.

979
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:07,140
Your sword is not like a mortal sword.

980
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:08,500
It was an eye-opener for me.

981
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:11,100
Is this a tie for them?

982
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:21,910
I still lost.

983
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:24,540
If you practice for another ten years,

984
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:27,310
perhaps your sword

985
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,430
will really surpass mine.

986
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:32,620
It's a pity

987
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:36,540
that you are going to die here today.

988
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:37,980
Luo Qingyang wants to kill him?

989
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:49,910
He actually took the bait so quickly?

990
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:51,270
Kill him.

991
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:52,950
Wuji Staff?

992
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,740
I thought

993
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,020
you were a man of extraordinary stature

994
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:59,170
to have this kind of cultivation,

995
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,140
but when faced

996
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,580
with such a talented young man,

997
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:02,580
City Lord Luo,

998
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,290
why were you so determined to kill him?

999
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,500
I have my reasons.

1000
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,910
But you can't kill

1001
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:12,740
this person today.
