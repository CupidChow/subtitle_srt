00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,020
It's called the Tide-Watching Inn,

26
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,340
but it's away from the sea.

27
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:00,580

I doubt they can hear anything.

30

00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,420
I asked about that boat

62
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,460
for you.

63
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,260
It's a major commercial ship from Qingzhou.

What kind of people do they need?

85
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,660
Is it about swimming and catching fish?

00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,340
why you've come to this remote village?

193
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,740
We trained under the same master.

194
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,340
I am their elder martial brother.

195
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,860
We are here on our master's order.

196
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,580
They came with me to see the world's

197
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,660
majestic peaks

198
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:50,740
and vast oceans.

199
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,860
Heaven meets the ocean at the horizon,

200
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,340
clouds enshroud the great mountains.

201
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,540
To see the edge of the ocean,

202
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,060
only the Xuesong Ship

203
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,900
of the Mu family can take you there.

204
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,420
However,

205
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,700
I need the gallbladders of three snakes.

206
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,100
You seem agile enough.

207
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:07,980
Could I

208
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,060
ask a favor of you?

209
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,460
What snakes do you need?

210
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,260
A gold-thread viper, a silver-shroud viper,

211
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,900
and an iron-glass viper.

212
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,540
These are highly venomous.

213
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:19,900
Why do you need their gallbladders?

214
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,220
I'll be honest with you.

215
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,780
I have a friend who is suffering

216
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,060
from a strange sickness.

217
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,500
No physicians can heal him.

218
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,900
I came across a formula

219
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,140
on an old tome.

220
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:30,940
It says

221
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,180
the medicine needs the gallbladders

222
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,100
of these snakes.

223
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,620
What sickness is that?

224
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,420
Peach blossoms showering down,

225
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,900
promises of love can wait.

226
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,140
Unrewarding intimacy in the ornate tent,

227
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,500
the peach blossoms' affection goes to waste.

228
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:55,620
Nice poem.

229
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:56,940
Nice poem, indeed.

230
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,100
What does it mean?

231
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,460
There's nothing nice about it.

232
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,300
Don't simply compliment anything.

233
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,940
He's trying to make an aphrodisiac.

234
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,340
You are straightforward with your words,

235
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,380
but you are right.

236
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,620
Is that friend of yours

237
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,180
actually you?

238
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,220
Of course not.

239
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,380
Getting the gallbladders is no easy feat.

240
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,460
You'd take the risk to help your friend.

241
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,740
It's hard not to suspect

242
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,020
that you want them for yourself.

243
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:28,860
I'll tell you the truth.

244
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,140
It's my elder brother who needs the medicine.

245
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:31,980
We came here

246
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:32,900
to find a cure

247
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:33,940
for my elder brother

248
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:34,540
and

249
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,180
to find some herbs.

250
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,660
Is it hard to cure this sickness?

251
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,740
Do many get it?

252
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:44,580
You're too young.

253
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:45,620
You won't understand.

254
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,540
I don't understand either.

255
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,820
So I'm the only one who knows?

256
00:09:59,180 --> 00:09:59,620
Both of you

257
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,820
are making it awkward for me.

258
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,940
I read a lot, that's all.

259
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,100
If you're willing to help,

260
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,940
I will help you reach

261
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,060
even the edge of the world.

262
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:13,820
Is that so?

263
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,620
The place we're headed for

264
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,740
is indeed at the edge of the world.

265
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:21,060
It's further than Sanshe Island?

266
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,820
I have a proposition, Mr. Mu.

267
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,180
When we reach Sanshe Island,

268
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,980
we'll get the gallbladders for you.

269
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,580
Leave a small boat for us.

270
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,420
We'll meet up again after seven days.

271
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:32,210
How does that sound?

272
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,540
What if you don't come back

273
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,900
after seven days?

274
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,540
There is no need to wait any longer.

275
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,620
You'd take great risks

276
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,580
only to get to

277
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,220
the edge of the ocean?

278
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,500
We get to see what no other humans can.

279
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,780
Isn't it worth it?

280
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,460
It is.

281
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,060
When will we set out?

282
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,100
In three days.

283
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:53,980
After

284
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,660
we've recruited enough snake catchers,

285
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:56,620
we set out.

286
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,220
Very well.

287
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:58,860
See you in three days.

288
00:10:59,180 --> 00:10:59,660
Wait.

289
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,580
According to my servant,

290
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,980
Lei has a powerful inner force.

291
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,100
Even the gold-thread viper feared him.

292
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,540
Tang

293
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,580
has formidable inner energy.

294
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,140
His skill was just as extraordinary.

295
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,420
But I haven't heard

296
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,300
what you

297
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,620
are capable of, Xiao.

298
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,540
Truth be told,

299
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,340
I'm not as capable.

300
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,940
But my friends

301
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,420
are willing to follow my lead.

302
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,220
Is that enough?

303
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:30,900
Very well.

304
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:31,900
Fish for sale!

305
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:32,940
Fresh catch of the day!

306
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:33,980
Mu agreed

307
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:34,980
in a heartbeat.

308
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,500
Is there a catch?

309
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:37,380
No.

310
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:38,660
Why not?

311
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,220
I've met plenty of scions

312
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:41,980
from rich families.

313
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,860
They think of themselves

314
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,260
as outstanding gentlemen,

315
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,100
but they all lack shrewdness.

316
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,540
After I told him

317
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,900
we were going to the edge of the ocean,

318
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,900
he thought he'd found a soulmate

319
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,060
and told us everything.

320
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,380
It was easy to swindle him.

321
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:58,820
Xiao Se.

322
00:11:59,100 --> 00:11:59,620
Was that

323
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,860
how you saw me?

324
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,100
I made a mistake and was wrong about you.

325
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,580
I thought you'd pretended to be broke,

326
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,780
but you are actually broke.

327
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:10,580
All right.

328
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:11,660
We got ourselves

329
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,620
a ship for the journey anyway.

330
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,140
The next plan...

331
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,300
Lian...

332
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,020
Lei Wujie.

333
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,180
I got us

334
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,500
a free ride.

335
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,380
Perhaps we could

336
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,660
have a decent meal tonight.

337
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,980
I'll invite Miss Zhenzhu

338
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,020
and get a grouper!

339
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:30,620
Good.

340
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:31,860
Let's go.

341
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:43,340
Hanyi.

342
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,700
When will you stop searching?

343
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:46,860
Get out of my way!

344
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,540
Take a closer look.

345
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,820
I am Lei Hong.

346
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:51,740
Lei Hong?

347
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:52,300
Yes.

348
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:53,700
I am Lei Hong.

349
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:54,700
Look at me.

350
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,060
Do you recognize me now?

351
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,580
Lei Hong.

352
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,980
If you and your brother

353
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,740
hadn't gone to Mount Wangcheng for the challenge,

354
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,060
Yuzhen and I would have been together.

355
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:06,540
If I hadn't

356
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,780
gone to the Lei Fortress for you,

357
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,980
Yuzhen wouldn't have left the mountain

358
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,940
and died.

359
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,620
Lei Hong, time to die!

360
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:19,620
Hanyi!

361
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,380
Why must I always come

362
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,700
to the rescue of those

363
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,460
in dire situations?

364
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,220
Is this

365
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,260
my destiny?

366
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,180
Perhaps I am destined

367
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,220
to descend to the mortal world

368
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,300
and bring light to the people.

369
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,340
I didn't want to become a deity,

370
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,860
but I was forced to become one.

371
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:43,660
Who are you?

372
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,380
I am Wuxin.

373
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,820
The Young Head of the Demon Sect?

374
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,020
That's Wuxin from Tianwaitian.

375
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,540
The Wuxin from Beili

376
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,540
is a mere monk

377
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,420
of Hanshui Temple.

378
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,260
Thank you for saving me.

379
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,140
But I didn't need it.

380
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:00,900
You should leave.

381
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,620
You got it all wrong.

382
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,140
I came looking for someone.

383
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,660
I was only saving you along the way.

384
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:08,620
What do you want?

385
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,220
She is on a rampage.

386
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,300
She is as strong as you!

387
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,020
I learned from my master

388
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:14,740
to become

389
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,140
a vanquisher of evil.

390
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:16,780
I'll chant some

391
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,820
calming incantations

392
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,660
to help the Xueyue Sword Deity

393
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,700
regain some consciousness.

394
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:37,980
I forgot the line.

395
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:40,580
Sorry.

396
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,620
It's been some time. I got rusty.

397
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:44,780
Whatever.

398
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,460
I'm not following in

399
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,420
my master's footsteps anyway.

400
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,220
Mr. Lei Hong.

401
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:49,540
Stall her for me.

402
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:50,820
I need an opening.

403
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:51,340
Okay.

404
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:55,940
Now!

405
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,060
The first strike resolves the heart,

406
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,460
the second strike breaks the karma,

407
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,620
the third strike quenches the evil,

408
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,900
the fourth strike vanquishes,

409
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:08,980
the fifth strike exorcises,

410
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,100
the sixth strike quells the darkness,

411
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,940
and the seventh strike brings forth the light!

412
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:19,940
Hanyi!

413
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:20,820
Hanyi!

414
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,460
It was worth it

415
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,420
to secretly learn this purification technique
from my martial brother.

416
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,100
A rampage?

417
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:28,940
It ends now.

418
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,620
Who are you?

419
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,180
I'm Wuxin

420
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,100
from Hanshui Temple.

421
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,820
You're Ye Dingzhi's son.

422
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:52,540
Yes.

423
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,580
You are nothing

424
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,900
like your father.

425
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,460
Is that so?

426
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,540
Your father

427
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,020
had this heroic appearance

428
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,740
and demeanor.

429
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,140
Many said

430
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,460
he didn't look like a martial artist

431
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,060
but a ruler.

432
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,380
You are unlike him.

433
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,220
I see

434
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,020
no competitiveness in you.

435
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,900
Judging by the tone,

436
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,460
you and my father

437
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:24,860
knew each other.

438
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,740
When I met him,

439
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,140
he was

440
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,740
he was merely wandering in Jiangnan.

441
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,060
He taught me a few sword techniques.

442
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,020
When I met him again,

443
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,060
he was already the Head of the Demon Sect.

444
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,300
Is that why you killed him?

445
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,060
If you're asking,

446
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,420
it means you're sure that I didn't do it.

447
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,340
If I killed him,

448
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,180
it would be between the righteous and evil,

449
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,820
and I would be doing the right thing.

450
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,420
Who was

451
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,220
the last person to have seen him?

452
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,340
A woman.

453
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,420
She and the Lone Sword Deity

454
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,820
got there ahead of us.

455
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:10,780
She whispered

456
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,420
some words to Ye Dingzhi.

457
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,220
Then, he slit his own throat.

458
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:18,860
I knew it.

459
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,900
I checked your pulse.

460
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,180
You have only
less than 20 percent of your power left.

461
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:26,940
It'd be unwise to let your enemies

462
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:27,820
know that.

463
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:28,980
Therefore,

464
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,620
return to Xueyue City

465
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,620
and recuperate.

466
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:33,740
Where are you going?

467
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,100
Somewhere I should be.

468
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,340
Sorry.

469
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,020
I touched your swords

470
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,220
without your permission.

471
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:02,940
They were filthy,

472
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:04,820
so I cleaned them for you.

473
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,220
Thank you.

474
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,100
It's been a long time.

475
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,020
If you don't turn back and look at me,

476
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,140
you haven't seen me yet.

477
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,140
Because

478
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:21,980
after so many years,

479
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,780
I didn't change for the better.

480
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,700
I'm not a shallow person.

481
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:32,300
But I am.

482
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,060
The moment I first

483
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,140
laid my eyes on you,

484
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,180
I had fallen for you.

485
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,980
Well, I've been there too.

486
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:51,500
Sorry.

487
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,300
Back on Mount Wangcheng,

488
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,140
I asked to meet again

489
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:56,820
after you became the greatest swordsman.

490
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:58,780
I didn't know

491
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,060
that promise

492
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:01,620
would cost you

493
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,100
years of your life.

494
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,780
Years of my life.

495
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,580
Over the years,

496
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,020
you could have met a lot of people.

497
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:17,700
You'd like some of them,

498
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,740
and the others, you'd dislike.

499
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:22,900
There are some

500
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,180
who would stay by your side forever.

501
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,980
Meeting you is more than

502
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:31,820
I'll ever need.

503
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,300
But I married him.

504
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,140
If

505
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,620
I was the first to have met you,

506
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,100
would things be different now?

507
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:44,420
No.

508
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,860
I'll always meet him before you.

509
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:49,380
There are things

510
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,380
we can never change.

511
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,100
Sorry.

512
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,100
I went berserk,

513
00:19:58,860 --> 00:19:59,380
but I remember

514
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,780
what I said to you.

515
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,100
I didn't mean what I said.

516
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:04,580
None of them

517
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,260
was your fault.

518
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:08,300
Instead,

519
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,340
I should thank you.

520
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,780
But I stand by what I said.

521
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,140
There are things

522
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,580
we can never change.

523
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,220
Farewell.

524
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,740
No news from Hanyi?

525
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,100
I wish I could go after her myself.

526
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,380
A series of incidents

527
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,060
indicate that someone is trying

528
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,940
to bring down Xueyue City.

529
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,700
[Zhufeng Abode]
We don't know the Tang Clan's stance.

530
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,340
The Lei Fortress suffered heavy losses.

531
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,660
It will take some time

532
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:13,980
for them to regain their strength.

533
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,340
The Wen family
isolates themselves from the world

534
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,860
and never gets involved in conflicts.

535
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,220
All three of our allies

536
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,540
are unreliable.

537
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,660
Two of our city lords went missing.

538
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,620
If you left,

539
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,180
Xueyue City would fall apart in no time.

540
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,940
In this game,

541
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,820
we are all pawns.

542
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:37,540
Indeed.

543
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:42,060
But sadly, the player is already dead.

544
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,500
He's bound Xueyue City

545
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:45,940
to Xiao Chuhe.

546
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,020
Is the attack on the Lei Fortress

547
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,940
connected to Wushuang City?

548
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:57,660
I doubt Song Yanhui

549
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,660
would get involved.

550
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,820
The martial arts world is a small place.

551
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,300
With Xueyue City losing its influence,

552
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,660
Wushuang City

553
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,300
stands to benefit from it.

554
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:06,420
So I think

555
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,020
they could be involved.

556
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,300
But in any case,

557
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,780
Xueyue City is bound

558
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:12,620
to battle Wushuang City.

559
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:13,780
For that,

560
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,420
I'll give it my best to prepare.

561
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:18,300
Until then,

562
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,260
Xueyue City

563
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,380
needs you to maintain order.

564
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:24,900
Understood.

565
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,580
We are going out into the sea!

566
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,180
I am so excited!

567
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:33,460
Keep it down.

568
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:34,580
People might think

569
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:35,700
we're a bunch of bumpkins

570
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,580
who haven't seen the sea.

571
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,420
It sounds like

572
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:38,980
you've been there.

573
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,460
No.

574
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,180
You haven't been there either?

575
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:44,700
Life is somewhat lacking

576
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,300
for those who have never seen

577
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,940
the vast sea.

578
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,180
Mr. Mu.

579
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,060
Mr. Mu, taking a walk on the street?

580
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,420
It seems you've found

581
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,260
your snake catchers.

582
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:57,780
Almost there.

583
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:58,820
Gentlemen,

584
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,260
get ready.

585
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,860
We are setting out soon.

586
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:02,620
Sure.

587
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:03,860
I'll head for the inn

588
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:04,740
and start packing.

589
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:05,380
Hold on.

590
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,700
I am coming with you.

591
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,820
I want to visit the fish market along the way.

592
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,420
Sure, let's go.

593
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:14,820
Maybe we should grab a meal

594
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:15,820
before leaving.

595
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:16,820
We're broke.

596
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,220
No worries.

597
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,300
I can pay.

598
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,620
Appreciated it, Mr. Mu.

599
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,180
I should invite Miss Zhenzhu.

600
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:24,780
She's been

601
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:25,740
very helpful.

602
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,380
We should return the favor.

603
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:28,420
Sure.

604
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:33,460
Who is that?

605
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,660
He doesn't seem like those from the Dark River.

606
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,700
A purple python robe.

607
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,540
It's the livery of eunuchs.

608
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,140
He works in the palace.

609
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,660
Well done, Mr. Mu.

610
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:44,980
He is one of

611
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,380
the Five Eunuchs.

612
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,180
The Director of Sword,

613
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,740
Eunuch Jinwei.

614
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,820
One of the Five Eunuchs?

615
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,700
Is he a friend of yours?

616
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:54,860
Is he coming with you?

617
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,060
That will be

618
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,500
a great honor for my ship.

619
00:23:59,220 --> 00:23:59,980
Unfortunately, no.

620
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,100
He is here to arrest me.

621
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,260
You?

622
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:04,900
Xiao Se...

623
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:07,980
Mr. Mu,

624
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:09,860
I hate to break it to you,

625
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,180
but my master is Eunuch Jade Deity,

626
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,260
Director of Incense in Tianqi City.

627
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,300
Unfortunately,

628
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,820
I was not interested in learning martial arts,

629
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,620
and I didn't want to become a eunuch.

630
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,220
After a fallout,

631
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,820
I fled from Tianqi City.

632
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:24,740
I met

633
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,740
my two friends on the road.

634
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,180
Without them,

635
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,140
I wouldn't have made it here.

636
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,020
What a shame.

637
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,540
Someone is here to stop us again.

638
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:37,980
I've heard of the great power

639
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,180
the Five Eunuchs hold.

640
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,020
But this is unacceptable.

641
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,660
It's fine that you forced him
to learn martial arts.

642
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,060
But you actually forced him to become

643
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,100
a eunuch, too?

644
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,100
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

645
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,420
What an unspeakable crime.

646
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,020
Xiao.

647
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,660
You are boarding my ship,

648
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,300
that makes you one of us.

649
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,380
I will keep you safe.

650
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,500
Many thanks, Mr. Mu.

651
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:01,620
Sir.

652
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,940
Come with me to Tianqi City.

653
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,660
If he went with you,

654
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,700
Mr. Xiao

655
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,660
would become Eunuch Xiao.

656
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:12,660
Who are you?

657
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,780
I am Mu Chunfeng,

658
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,980
the third son of the Mu family from Qingzhou.

659
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,260
The scion of the Mu family.

660
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,340
I have no intention

661
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,860
of obstructing your family business.

662
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,860
However, one of your comrades

663
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,340
is a runaway

664
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,940
who fled from his home.

665
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:34,700
I must take him with me.

666
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,500
Mr. Mu, I hope you don't mind.

667
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:37,740
What if we refuse

668
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:38,700
to let you take him?

669
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,060
That sword...

670
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,340
I know it!

671
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,660
The Eye of Abyss.

672
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,100
It's slain too many people

673
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:49,980
and is now too violent.

674
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,020
Hence, it's not listed
on the Records of Famous Swords.

675
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,300
It was one of the swords

676
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,020
of the late Emperor.

677
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,060
Not on my watch!

678
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:00,700
Mr. Mu!

679
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:13,580
Stop.

680
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:14,940
Mountains Mover.

681
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,460
Mountains Mover?

682
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,500
One of the ten famous swords!

683
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,980
You wear a robe of golden threads

684
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,460
and wield the Mountains Mover.

685
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,500
The Mu family sure is wealthy.

686
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,820
Eunuch Jinwei has no intention to kill.

687
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,020
It's pointless

688
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,300
to fight.

689
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,460
I have a proposal.

690
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,660
We'll speak in private.

691
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,860
It's been years.

692
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:44,860
Eunuch,

693
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,140
you still haven't taken up smiling.

694
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,620
I came to Dongji Sea City

695
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:49,820
for some official work.

696
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,020
A few days ago,

697
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,740
I received a message.

698
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,380
It said you'd be

699
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,260
setting out to sea from this town.

700
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,140
The most obstinate person

701
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,260
in Tianqi City

702
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,620
has usually been you.

703
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,020
But think about it.

704
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,980
The heir of the Heart Sword is with me.

705
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,260
He got his mastery from Lei Hong and Li Hanyi.

706
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,620
He is one step away

707
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,140
from reaching the Insouciant Phase.

708
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,540
My eldest martial brother from Xueyue City

709
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,820
is one of the finest young warriors.

710
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,900
Not to mention I have the Mu family's backing.

711
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,780
It won't be easy for you

712
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,940
to take me away.

713
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,860
Do you really think

714
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,700
I came alone

715
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,370
on this business trip?

716
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:34,780
But is it necessary to bring your men along?

717
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,820
I believe the order from your superiors

718
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:37,940
was to

719
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,500
operate in secrecy.

720
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,700
What do you have in mind?

721
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,260
How about this?

722
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,500
Let's both take a step back.

723
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,340
We will have a duel

724
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,060
by the seaside in three days.

725
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,580
I'm only sending

726
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,420
Lei and Lian to the fight.

727
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,660
You must fight them alone.

728
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,700
If you manage to beat them,

729
00:27:59,140 --> 00:27:59,980
I'll go with you.

730
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:01,180
Three days?

731
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,940
It'll be fine if you don't trust Yu

732
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:08,020
because he never plays by the rules.

733
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,580
You can't trust

734
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,340
Chong either.

735
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,620
He is too shrewd

736
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,140
and cunning.

737
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,420
But you can trust me.

738
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,140
You know me.

739
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,460
You're a man of your word.

740
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,540
Everyone in Tianqi City knows that.

741
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:26,700
Very well.

742
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,780
I shall hold you

743
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:30,940
to this promise.

744
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,580
See you then.

745
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,180
Xiao Se,

746
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,180
what did you

747
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,460
promise Eunuch Jinwei?

748
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,300
A duel by the seaside three days from now.

749
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,300
A duel?

750
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:50,820
He bought that?

751
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,460
In his eyes,

752
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:53,340
I'm the trustworthy

753
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,380
Lord Yong'an.

754
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,180
He didn't think

755
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,500
I'd resort to petty deception.

756
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,540
Now I kind of pity him.

757
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,500
Not bad, Xiao Se.

758
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,020
You used the same trick on me,

759
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:04,700
didn't you?

760
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,220
There is

761
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,740
no turning back now.

762
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:10,700
If we did,

763
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:11,660
that eunuch

764
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:12,620
would take Xiao Se away.

765
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:13,780
Qianluo.

766
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,020
I sent you back

767
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,380
to notify the Third Master, didn't I?

768
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,020
Why did you follow us?

769
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,780
I could send a message with a pigeon.

770
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,860
Why should I travel all the way back?

771
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,220
Besides, you promised

772
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,580
to wait for me here.

773
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:25,500
Lucky for me,

774
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,220
I didn't fall for it

775
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,140
as Eunuch Jinwei did.

776
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,580
Xiao Se, you're a liar!

777
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:29,820
Lei Wujie.

778
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,500
Apprehend your martial sister.

779
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,380
Ask the Mu family to send her back

780
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,340
on another boat.

781
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:34,700
Yes.

782
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:35,700
Not a chance!

783
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,020
Let's forget it.

784
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,260
Coward.

785
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:42,660
You know each other?

786
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,620
I should ask you the same thing.

787
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,140
You know each other?

788
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:51,180
Not really.

789
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:52,660
We met on the road.

790
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:53,500
Miss Qianluo said

791
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,140
she wanted to see the sea too.

792
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,540
So, she tagged along.

793
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,500
Did you agree to let her tag along

794
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,460
because

795
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,980
you found her pretty?

796
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,220
Not at all.

797
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,820
I admire her

798
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,060
for her wish

799
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:08,140
to travel the sea at such a young age.

800
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,580
I am impressed.

801
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:11,500
If Qianluo

802
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,180
weren't the beauty she is,

803
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,500
would you have

804
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,740
brought her along?

805
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,620
Probably not.

806
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:18,860
It's a long journey.

807
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:19,980
One more passenger

808
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,500
is another mouth to feed.

809
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,740
Do you know

810
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,580
that she didn't come along

811
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:26,860
to visit the sea

812
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,500
but to meet someone?

813
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,060
Who is it?

814
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:30,820
Him.

815
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:33,540
All right, cut it out.

816
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:34,940
You're making a fool of yourself.

817
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,980
Perhaps I got ahead of myself.

818
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,660
By the way, Mu,

819
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,420
what were you

820
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,260
wearing back then?

821
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,740
You took a slash from Eunuch Jinwei,

822
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,100
but you weren't hurt at all.

823
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:53,620
It was the robe of golden threads.

824
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,580
Robe of golden threads?

825
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:56,900
The robe of golden threads.

826
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,340
Treasure of the Mu family.

827
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,380
It cannot be pierced and is impregnable.

828
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:01,460
It can fit either a child

829
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,980
or a strong soldier

830
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,740
without any issues.

831
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,700
That sounds amazing.

832
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,620
I've never heard of it.

833
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:10,300
Because

834
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,740
it costs so much

835
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,140
that no one can afford it.

836
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,700
Its maker,

837
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,140
Wu Liujia, and Jiguan Sect

838
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:17,260
went bankrupt.

839
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:22,060
Mountains Mover forged by Li Suwang,

840
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,420
and robe of golden threads forged by Wu Liujia.

841
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:25,660
The Mu family of Qingzhou

842
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:26,740
sure is wealthy.

843
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:28,940
Money

844
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,700
is only a worldly possession.

845
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,100
Only the rich say that.

846
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:34,380
All right.

847
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,660
It's time

848
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,580
we have the conversation.

849
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,300
What conversation?

850
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:42,780
About

851
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,940
your true identities.

852
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:46,780
We've told you

853
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:47,780
who we are.

854
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,900
A Lei,

855
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,140
a Tang,

856
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,380
and a Sikong.

857
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:55,420
There is also a Xiao among you.

858
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,500
These surnames

859
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,860
belong to reputable families of Beili.

860
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,420
My elder brother thought

861
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:01,420
I was a geek,

862
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,700
but I am no fool.

863
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,020
How much do you know?

864
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:08,260
I know the Third City Lord of Xueyue City

865
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,780
is Sikong Changfeng.

866
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,580
He wields a spear.

867
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,060
Therefore,

868
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:15,300
it's fair to guess

869
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,020
you are his daughter.

870
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,100
Everyone knows

871
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,940
Sikong Changfeng has a daughter.

872
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:22,220
But she has never left Xueyue City.

873
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:23,900
That's right.

874
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:26,620
Tang Mohe is certainly

875
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:27,580
not your name.

876
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,500
You're the eldest martial brother,

877
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,580
Tang Lian.

878
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,460
You know quite a few things.

879
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:33,980
I didn't think

880
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,100
I'd meet so many famous figures.

881
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,940
I know who you are.

882
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,420
Your fame is no one par

883
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,820
with the other two,

884
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,220
that you're lesser-known,

885
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,540
but I am more interested

886
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,460
in you.

887
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,740
Your master

888
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,620
is an unmatched beauty.

889
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,300
You know that too?

890
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,420
So, who am I?

891
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,180
You are

892
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,940
Luo Mingxuan.

893
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:00,140
I'm not that gambling addict!

894
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:01,980
I am Lei Wujie!

895
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,500
From the Lei Fortress!

896
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,740
My master is Li Hanyi,

897
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:05,740
one of the five sword deities,

898
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,420
the Second City Lord of Xueyue City!

899
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,740
Your master is Li Hanyi?

900
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,300
Are you telling the truth?

901
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:12,900
Don't worry.

902
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,060
We've hidden

903
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,500
our identities for so long.

904
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:17,540
If you hadn't

905
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,420
gotten on his nerves,

906
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,180
this fool

907
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,460
wouldn't have told you the truth.

908
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:24,500
You must be...

909
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:25,580
Enough guessing.

910
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,340
I am from Xueyue City,

911
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,740
but I do not know martial arts.

912
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:30,660
I don't have

913
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,940
a reputation in the martial arts world.

914
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,140
I have some idea

915
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,340
about why you were in Xueyue City.

916
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,660
You could tell?

917
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,060
Everyone knows Sikong Changfeng

918
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,300
studied under Medicine King Xin Baicao.

919
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,540
He is the best healer in the world.

920
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,540
You went to him for treatment.

921
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,100
It seems

922
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,700
he never cured you.

923
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,060
From the moment I met you,

924
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,100
I could tell

925
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:57,340
you are dying.

926
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,020
What do you mean?

927
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,140
I grew up studying medicinal knowledge.

928
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:05,980
I know what I saw.

929
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:09,020
Is he telling the truth?

930
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:11,780
Yes.

931
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:13,900
I thought

932
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,380
we could return to Tianqi City

933
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,380
if the journey was fruitless.

934
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,020
But it seems failure

935
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:21,340
would mean the end of you.

936
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,180
Sorry.

937
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,060
I didn't have a choice.

938
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,780
You went on this voyage

939
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,500
to search for one place.

940
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,460
There lives

941
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:34,300
someone who can save you.

942
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,700
I advise you to put an end

943
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,820
to your speculations.

944
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,380
I'm not a prodigy,

945
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,020
but I have medical knowledge.

946
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,700
Perhaps you've already

947
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:45,780
found the person

948
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,180
who can save you.

949
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,140
This is

950
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,460
extraordinary.

951
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:10,660
She is better than me.

952
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:15,140
She is Medicine King Xin Baicao's apprentice

953
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:16,820
and his heir.

954
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:20,020
The heir of Medicine Valley.

955
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:22,300
It's no surprise she is this skilled.

956
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:24,420
Xiao.

957
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,660
I have a favor to ask.

958
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,420
When you return to Beili,

959
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,500
could you

960
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,020
recommend me to her?

961
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,740
I wish to study under the heir.

962
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,220
I've always admired Medicine Valley.

963
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,220
Sadly,

964
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,300
Medicine King Xin Baicao is always traveling.

965
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,780
His whereabouts are unpredictable.

966
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,420
But the honor of studying under his apprentice

967
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,820
is more than enough for me.

968
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:45,740
No problem.

969
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:48,020
But Mr. Mu,

970
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:49,900
can you still treat me?

971
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,780
If I continued the treatment,

972
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,500
it'd only do you more harm.

973
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:59,620
I went ahead of myself earlier.

974
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,340
I am embarrassed.

975
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,100
Truly embarrassed.

976
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,380
But Xiao,

977
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:08,220
why didn't you take the Divine Healer

978
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,260
with you?

979
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,060
If she were here,

980
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,500
she could

981
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,660
extend your life.

982
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,420
The voyage is full of perils.

983
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,500
She's done enough for me.

984
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,900
I can't put her in harm's way again.

985
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:27,180
Even though we've just met,

986
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:30,140
I wish we had met sooner.

987
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,460
If you were well,

988
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,820
I'd really like to

989
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,780
have a drink with you.

990
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:56,500
Qianluo.

991
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,660
It's getting late.

992
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:00,940
Mr. Mu's treatment

993
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,420
could take a lot longer.

994
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,860
Go back inside and rest.

995
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:04,500
No.

996
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:08,140
Xiao Se had better not know about this.

997
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:09,940
No one can get rid of me tonight.

998
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,180
I must keep watch.

999
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,020
Qianluo...

1000
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:15,900
Lei Wujie.

1001
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:18,460
Xiao Se

1002
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,420
is going to live, right?

1003
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:21,020
Yes.

1004
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,220
He will live.

1005
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:24,820
After all,

1006
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,180
no one else

1007
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:27,140
in the entire world

1008
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,220
would befriend

1009
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,260
someone as petty

1010
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:31,060
and stingy as him.

1011
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,460
Xiao Se, finally!

1012
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,060
You little airhead.

1013
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:42,780
When you couldn't pay

1014
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:43,860
for your noodles,

1015
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,500
it was me who took you in.

1016
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:48,580
Well?

1017
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,860
Did Mr. Mu cure you?

1018
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,980
I overestimated my skill.

1019
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,700
The Divine Healer had treated him.

1020
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,540
My skill is insignificant

1021
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:58,980
compared to hers.

1022
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,500
I'm not dying anytime sooner.

1023
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:02,820
Mr. Mu.

1024
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:03,580
Yes.

1025
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:06,180
We agreed to have a drink.

1026
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,500
Let's get that done.

1027
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:10,460
Certainly.

1028
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:24,340
Third City Lord.

1029
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,180
The Second City Lord is back.

1030
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:32,740
Hanyi.

1031
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:34,620
Sit.

1032
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:41,620
Hanyi.

1033
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,060
Who got rid

1034
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,700
of your demonic aura?

1035
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:45,780
Wuxin.

1036
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:48,900
Why did he come back?

1037
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,980
He wants to know who Ye Dingzhi met

1038
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,820
before he died.

1039
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,700
Did you tell him?

1040
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,900
His next destination

1041
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,700
is probably Tianqi City.

1042
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,180
Should we inform Lanyue?

1043
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,540
Don't worry,

1044
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:05,900
I'll see to it.

1045
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:06,980
Come on.

1046
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:14,380
Well?

1047
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:19,100
The old injury is not fully healed.

1048
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:22,180
The new injury sent her berserk.

1049
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,180
She barely has any inner force left.

1050
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,060
Hanyi.

1051
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:26,820
It might take

1052
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,260
longer than three years to regain

1053
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:30,900
your strength as a sword deity.

1054
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,660
You must be prepared.

1055
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:35,780
From now on,

1056
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,180
don't return to Mount Cang.

1057
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,820
Stay in Xueyue City.

1058
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,020
Sikong...

1059
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,380
There is no room for discussion.

1060
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,300
How are Jie

1061
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:47,140
and Xiao Chuhe?

1062
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,420
Qianluo sent a letter.

1063
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,060
They are on their way

1064
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:52,820
to the celestial mountain

1065
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,900
to find a cure for Xiao Chuhe's sickness.

1066
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,020
Judging by the time,

1067
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:58,980
they should arrive very soon.

1068
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:02,740
Do you know

1069
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:03,900
how much time

1070
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,260
we've spent on the sea?

1071
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,100
No idea.

1072
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:09,900
All I know is

1073
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,740
I've spent each day

1074
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:13,620
doing mostly nothing.

1075
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,860
We'll reach Sanshe Island soon.

1076
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,740
Already?

1077
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,940
I calculated as much.

1078
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,020
We'll soon part ways

1079
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,060
for some time.

1080
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,300
I've invited you

1081
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,380
to this farewell dinner.

1082
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,540
We might not come back alive

1083
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:31,380
after we leave.

1084
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:33,620
Do not jinx yourself

1085
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,380
during a goodbye on the sea.

1086
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:39,380
Mr. Mu.

1087
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,420
You once took a slash

1088
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:43,660
from the Director of Sword for us.

1089
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:44,500
Yeah.

1090
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:45,820
He wanted

1091
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,940
to take you back just to make you a eunuch.

1092
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:50,260
I couldn't let that stand.

1093
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,020
I lied.

1094
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:54,540
-Xiao Se.
-Xiao Se.

1095
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:55,300
It's fine.

1096
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:57,660
Mr. Mu has helped us

1097
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:59,580
too many times along the way.

1098
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:01,620
If he was

1099
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:03,860
put in harm's way

1100
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,860
for helping me,

1101
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,380
I'd never forgive myself.

1102
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,860
Does that mean

1103
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:13,220
you're a person of great status?

1104
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,300
Your name is Xiao Se.

1105
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:17,860
Xiao...

1106
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:23,020
Are you from the imperial family?

1107
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:24,620
Correct.

1108
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,460
I am from the imperial family of Xiao.

1109
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:29,900
My real name is Xiao Chuhe.

1110
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:32,020
Xiao Chuhe?

1111
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:33,780
Lord Yong'an?

1112
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:36,740
You're overreacting.

1113
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,020
How can I not?

1114
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:40,220
It's too late for you

1115
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,540
to get rid of us.

1116
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:42,980
You are the Lord Yong'an

1117
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,340
who accepted his punishment

1118
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,420
and lost his title

1119
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:46,660
for defending Lord Langya?

1120
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:47,580
The one

1121
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,820
who would rather wander the world than go back?

1122
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:51,020
Great.

1123
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,300
