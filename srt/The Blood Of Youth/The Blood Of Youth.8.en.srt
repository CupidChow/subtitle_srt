[Episode 8]

25
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,420
Miss Sikong, I'm surprised

26
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,260
that your martial arts skills
had greatly improved so much

27
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,460
after not meeting for a while.

28
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:30,940
Of course.

29
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,100
You've become prettier too.

He passed the 14th floor.

32
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,140
He passed the 14th floor!

33
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,380
The 14th floor!

34
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,060
He actually passed the 14th floor!

35
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,260
That means he has one floor to clear.

36
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,260
Sorry to keep you waiting.

37
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:47,740
Let's continue where we left off.

38
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:48,940
Xiao Se,

39
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,980
they are...

40
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,500
Judging from their clothes,

41
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,900
you must be from Mount Wangcheng.

42
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,340
We met by accident.

43
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,300
I asked them to perform a divination

44
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,300
for me.

45
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,020
I'm Li Fansong of Mount Wangcheng.

46
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,260
Greetings, Miss Sikong.

47
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,580
I wonder what brings you two

48
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,340
to Xueyue City.

49
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,100
Well...

50
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:08,340
We...

51
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,580
We're here for sightseeing.

52
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:10,940
Yes, for sightseeing.

53
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:11,660
So,

54
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,380
shall we begin?

55
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:18,660
Take this.

56
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:21,860
What's this?

57
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,620
This medicine is called Iced Pure Water.

58
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:24,740
If an ordinary person consumes it,

59
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,420
the blood in the body

60
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,460
will freeze in an instant.

61
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,060
But it works differently for you.

62
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,700
Your Fire Infusion

63
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,610
has reached the Karura Phase.

64
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,340
But your physical body can't take it.

65
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,020
If you use the skill too long,

66
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,260
it'll harm your body.

67
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:38,660
And this Iced Pure Water

68
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,020
can protect your heart meridian

69
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,860
and extend the time of using Fire Infusion.

70
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:44,500
Thank you, Lian.

71
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:46,980
By the way,

72
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,940
do you have any advice
on how to pass the 15th floor?

73
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,300
I suggest you come again tomorrow.

74
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:53,740
Tomorrow?

75
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,460
Different disciples

76
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:56,660
take turns to be in charge

77
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,460
of Dengtian Tower's every floor.

78
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,580
Only the Elder Keeper of the Tower will remain

79
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,060
on the same floor for ten years.

80
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,700
You must be tired today.

81
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,100
Go back and get some rest.

82
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:07,260
Come back tomorrow.

83
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:09,660
All right.

84
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:11,740
Lian,

85
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,460
can you tell me

86
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,060
who the Elder Keeper of the Tower

87
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:15,780
defending the 15th floor is?

88
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,620
If you meet him,

89
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,340
you'll find him amiable.

90
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,340
Director of Incense, you actually took the time

91
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,340
to visit the Directorate of Astronomy.

92
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,540
That's really rare.

93
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:44,700
Have some tea.

94
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,820
There are so many dignitaries in the court

95
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,460
who wish to visit the Directorate of Astronomy.

96
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,580
But they never get to meet you, State Preceptor.

97
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,300
I was afraid to lose face

98
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,740
as you might turn me away.

99
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,300
That's why I never came before this.

100
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,100
Director of Incense, you must be joking.

101
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:11,580
State Preceptor,

102
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,660
so this must be the Xingyue Pavilion

103
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,500
of the Directorate of Astronomy.

104
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,100
It's said that all the supervisors
of the past dynasties

105
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,980
have watched stars here

106
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,580
to unravel the world's major events.

107
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,300
I wonder

108
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,860
what you have unraveled.

109
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:42,780
Tomorrow...

110
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,700
it'll rain.

111
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,340
Is that all?

112
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,700
It'll continue to rain
until the day after tomorrow.

113
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:56,940
There will be a west wind.

114
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,580
It will be sunny after three days.

115
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,260
But it's still not certain yet.

116
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,660
I've always thought

117
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,580
that you are

118
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:08,620
a reticent man who doesn't tell jokes.

119
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,980
I didn't expect you

120
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,100
to have such a leisurely mood.

121
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,540
I wasn't joking.

122
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,100
Don't you believe me?

123
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,700
Naturally, I'll believe you.

124
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,140
But you should know

125
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,180
I'm not asking

126
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,180
(about tomorrow's weather)

127
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,180
but

128
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,980
the future of this dynasty.

129
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,380
The future of this dynasty is heaven's will.

130
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,780
(Heaven's will can't simply be predicted.)

131
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,260
Because when you know

132
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,340
heaven's will,

133
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:10,900
(it has already begun)

134
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,060
(to change.)

135
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,420
(It's only a possibility,)

136
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,620
(not a definite answer.)

137
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,700
(But what people want to know)

138
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,740
(is an answer.)

139
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,580
(So the heaven's will)

140
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,660
(that you asked about)

141
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,780
(doesn't exist.)

142
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:36,820
Why?

143
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,620
There are two outcomes of this divination.

144
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,820
Can you tell me

145
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,580
what it means if it shows peach blossom again?

146
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,140
If it's peach blossom,

147
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,940
then this divination shows Yongjiu,

148
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,420
which means people without a leader.

149
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,100
Is it auspicious or ominous?

150
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,860
It's highly auspicious. A harmonious world

151
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,220
with no leader in a host of dragons.

152
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,020
As soon as the time is right,

153
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,300
it'll transform into a dragon
and fly to the highest heaven.

154
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,300
What if it's a peach wood sword?

155
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:09,660
Extremely ominous.

156
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,180
The dragon will die in desolation

157
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,180
with heavy bleeding.

158
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,300
I see.

159
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,220
I never believed in heaven's will.

160
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,300
I only believe in myself.

161
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,340
I just have

162
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,420
a little hesitation in my heart.

163
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,700
I was thinking about

164
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,740
whether I should make a decision.

165
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:36,820
But I wasn't brave enough.

166
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:38,820
That's why I asked

167
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,140
for heaven's will timidly.

168
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:41,660
But

169
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:42,860
I suddenly understood.

170
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:45,980
So it doesn't matter

171
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,180
if this divination was performed.

172
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:50,340
Thank you.

173
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,260
You're welcome.

174
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:53,940
I wasn't doing it for you.

175
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,020
After all,

176
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:57,580
if I really destroyed

177
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,380
eight-tenths of Mount Wangcheng's way of heaven,

178
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,860
I'm really afraid Zhao Yuzhen

179
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,100
will come after my head with his sword.

180
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:11,420
Xiao Se!

181
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:13,860
Qianluo.

182
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:14,900
Why did you come back down again?

183
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,660
I just finished my fight
with Eldest Martial Brother.

184
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,020
He told me to get some rest

185
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:18,820
and go back again tomorrow.

186
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,700
Sounds like you've won.

187
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,420
Well, thank you.

188
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,380
Lei Wujie,

189
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,860
how can you win Lian

190
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,340
with that mediocre skill of yours?

191
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,300
I'm sure he lost on purpose.

192
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:31,940
He did no such thing.

193
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,300
Eldest Martial Brother said he went all out.

194
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,180
I'll let you go this time.

195
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:37,660
After you officially join us,

196
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,380
we'll have a spar.

197
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,500
Well, that's all. I'll get going, then.

198
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,540
Fine, we'll spar.

199
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,020
Enough.

200
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,540
Just do what Lian said.

201
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,060
I'm tired too.

202
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,380
I'll take you out for a drink tonight.

203
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:50,740
All right.

204
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,460
[Donggui Tavern]

205
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,540
Why did you stop?

206
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,020
We're here.

207
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,020
We're here?

208
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:08,700
This place?

209
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,100
But...

210
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,140
I don't have money on me.

211
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:14,660
Don't worry.

212
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,820
We won't need to pay for tonight's liquor.

213
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,540
We'll pay with fate.

214
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,220
Pay with fate?

215
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,500
We're paying liquor with fate?

216
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,700
Returning to the east.

217
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,100
The gentleman in the east is waiting for guests.

218
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,180
What are you

219
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,100
muttering about?

220
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,300
I don't see the tavern's owner anywhere.

221
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,260
Isn't he over there sleeping on the roof?

222
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,140
That's the tavern's owner?

223
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,620
I've never seen a tavern owner

224
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,820
gets drunk from drinking.

225
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,380
It's just some liquor.

226
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,180
He even ends up drinking on the roof.

227
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:55,420
It's nothing but to lighten up the mood.

228
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,660
You can't even stand properly.

229
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,820
How is that not drunk?

230
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,020
It's the person who wants to get drunk,
not the liquor.

231
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:14,860
My friend here

232
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,620
wants to drink a cup of liquor.

233
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,260
I wonder if he's lucky to drink it.

234
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:23,260
Being drunk all year long.

235
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:28,100
Fate has brought this liquor and you together.

236
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,220
Since fate brought us together,

237
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,700
I ask for a drink now.

238
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,540
Be patient.

239
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:38,020
Just one last touch of the moonlight.

240
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:45,700
"I want to dance with Chang'e
in the Moon Palace in my drunken dreams.

241
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:53,100
So I invite her
as I lift the unfiltered liquor to the sky.

242
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,020
Anyone who likes the moon tonight

243
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:07,020
can come up and play the flute."

244
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:21,540
Have a drink.

245
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,300
This is the best Beauty of Four Seasons.

246
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,180
What do you think?

247
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,700
"Soothing as the breeze.

248
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,380
Graceful as the flower.

249
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,500
Still as the snow.

250
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,980
Cold as the moon."

251
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,460
A good liquor has one taste.

252
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,340
Diaolou Parlor claims Qiulubai

253
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,860
has three tastes.

254
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,500
Do you think my liquor has four tastes?

255
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:00,820
In my opinion,

256
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,140
all the tastes in the world
are nothing more than this.

257
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:09,820
"Still as the snow.

258
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,260
Cold as the moon."

259
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,180
You made this liquor sound like

260
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,180
it's not strong enough.

261
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,020
I don't like it.

262
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,140
I prefer

263
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,980
fiery liquor.

264
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:21,660
But

265
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,500
I'll try it since you poured it.

266
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,100
This liquor...

267
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,540
What's going on?

268
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:53,820
How do you feel?

269
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:56,980
Who are you?

270
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:58,900
What kind of liquor is this?

271
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,900
I'm the owner of this tavern.

272
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,540
This is my Beauty of Four Seasons.

273
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,020
Tell me

274
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,460
if you want

275
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,260
to drink the second bowl.

276
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:46,380
♪Staring at the endless abyss beneath my feet♪

277
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,380
♪It entices the purity of the world♪

278
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,260
Do you dare

279
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,220
to drink the third bowl?

280
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:56,020
♪The freezing rain blurred my vision♪

281
00:14:56,140 --> 00:15:01,100
♪I move forward desperately against the world♪

282
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:05,820
♪I can't resist the heartbeat♪

283
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:10,900
♪That changes with my breathing♪

284
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,700
♪It bursts into flames♪

285
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:22,700
♪And brightens up the dark night♪

286
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:29,500
♪I listen to the wind howling through my ears♪

00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:34,940
♪With a sharp sword in my hand♪

288
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:37,620
Do you still want to drink

289
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,460
the fourth bowl?

290
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:43,020
You'll die if you drink this.

291
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,220
If you die,

292
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,460
you can go straight to heaven

293
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,500
instead of the Dengtian Tower.

294
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,500
♪My journey begins to change with my thoughts♪

295
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,140
Give it to me.

♪All good and evil are no match

297

You...

298
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,300
You're drunk.

299
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:05,300
Get some sleep.

300
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:08,060
♪Using my ardent youth
as an offering for my past♪

301
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,300
That lad

302
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,340
had reached the 14th floor.

303
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,020
He must be here for you.

304
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,020
Don't you want to see him?

305
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,660
Maybe the Lei family sent him here

306
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,610
to find Lei Yunhe.

307
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,420
If the Lei Clan sent him here,

308
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,380
he would have come to me with his visiting card

309
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,420
instead of going through
Dengtian Tower's trials.

310
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:39,940
I've met that kid.

311
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,940
He's clad in red

312
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,420
just like his mother back then.

313
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,780
But he takes after

314
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,260
his father's silly personality

315
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,460
and your...

316
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,100
I heard the one you're waiting for

317
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:52,500
has entered the city.

318
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,780
Why didn't you go and meet him?

319
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,420
Why should I feel anxious when you're not?

320
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,420
Where's my martial brother?

321
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,300
Why didn't he come with you?

322
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,340
Him?

323
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,940
To decoct his Oblivion Broth,

324
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,220
he traveled to the celestial mountain

325
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,820
in search of the last medicinal herb.

326
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:13,900
Oblivion Broth?

327
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,020
Does he really want to

328
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,420
forget the past that badly?

329
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,300
He only wants to

330
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,820
forget one thing.

331
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,420
We were talking about Lei Wujie.

332
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,100
Why did you change the subject

333
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,220
to your martial brother?

334
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:30,540
Be honest with me,

335
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,300
do you really not want to see him?

336
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:36,940
When are you going to

337
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:37,940
be less stubborn?

338
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,220
You really need to change it.

339
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,340
He's your...

340
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,420
Never mind.

341
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,220
We'll stop talking about Lei Wujie.

342
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,780
Other than Lei Wujie,

343
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,220
your old friend's disciple

344
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,260
is also here.

345
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:51,420
Old friend?

346
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,540
Zhao Yuzhen

347
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,100
of Mount Wangcheng.

348
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:11,940
His Fire Infusion

349
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,100
has broken through the third phase.

350
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,020
If he has to break through

351
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:16,780
these phases himself,

352
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,260
it'll take him at least three years.

353
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,500
Now, it only took him three bowls of liquor.

354
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,460
Tang Lian would never

355
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,460
let Lei Wujie rest for no reason.

356
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,820
I'm guessing this is also what you want.

357
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,540
You're Liquor Deity, Baili Dongjun,

358
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,020
the Principal City Lord of Xueyue City.

359
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,860
With this lad's ability,

360
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,340
he can only reach the 14th floor at most.

361
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,940
He can't beat the one on the 15th floor.

362
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,660
It should be the Elder Keeper of the Tower

363
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,620
defending the 15th floor,

364
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,540
an elder of Xueyue City.

365
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,020
Why do you have to guess?

366
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:48,980
You'll know who it is tomorrow.

367
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:50,820
True.

368
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,500
You can have this tavern.

369
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:55,820
I'll get going first.

370
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,260
Where are you going?

371
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:01,820
To search for a new recipe for liquor.

372
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,780
You manage to make an incomparable liquor

373
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,700
like the Beauty of Four Seasons.

374
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,380
Do you still need a new recipe?

375
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:11,820
It's a recipe for Oblivion Broth.

376
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:13,740
Oblivion Broth?

377
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,580
You only need one bowl

378
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,140
to forget

379
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,820
everything that had happened.

380
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:25,180
When you wake up, it'll be a new life.

381
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:26,780
That would be nice.

382
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,540
It's too bad I haven't been able to make it.

383
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,340
If I did manage to make it,

384
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:32,900
I'm sure

385
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,500
you would also want one, right?

386
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,420
Xiao Chu...

387
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,500
I'm Xiao Se.

388
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,540
I'm just the owner of an inn.

389
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,660
Then I'm not Baili Dongjun.

390
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,300
I'm just the owner of a tavern.

391
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,180
When you point your sword,

392
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,220
make sure it's parallel to the ground.

393
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:10,900
Wield!

394
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,020
Back.

395
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,060
Wield!

396
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,020
Withdraw!

397
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,060
Hanyi, I don't want to practice anymore.

398
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,500
I want to stop practicing.

399
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:23,740
I don't want to practice anymore.

400
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:24,500
Jie, get up.

401
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,220
Jie, you're a good boy.

402
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,180
There, there. Don't cry.

403
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,140
Let's continue practicing, all right?

404
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:31,940
Let's stand up

405
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:32,860
and continue practicing. Is that all right?

406
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,380
That's a good boy.

407
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,460
It's been 15 years.

408
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,020
I truly fail

409
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,020
as an older sister.

410
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,300
You're awake?

411
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:53,660
Xiao Se.

412
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,500
Where's the owner?

413
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,580
He already left to search
for a new recipe for liquor.

414
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:00,820
Search for a new recipe for liquor?

415
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,300
Who is he anyway?

416
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,500
Why do you care?

417
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,380
He helped you break through

418
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,060
three phases of Fire Infusion.

419
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:08,660
You only need to remember

420
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:09,700
that he's an expert

421
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,500
and also a good person.

422
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:12,820
You're right.

423
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,620
Time to go to Dengtian Tower.

424
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:16,900
Go after your breakfast.

425
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:18,460
You're right.

426
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,180
I'll have the strength after I eat.

427
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:20,940
Let's go.

428
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,060
Time to have some breakfast.

429
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,900
We're going to go our separate ways soon.

430
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,580
I'll buy you the last breakfast.

431
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:31,460
Xiao Se,

432
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:32,980
you sounded somber

433
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,100
when you said that.

434
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:35,860
Not at all.

435
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,220
It's just going to be

436
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,460
another long journey back.

437
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:40,820
When I think about it carefully,

438
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,100
it's only for a mere 800 silver taels.

439
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,700
Here you go again.

440
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:45,860
I'll head to the tower first.

441
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:03,300
Lei Yunhe?

442
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,940
My martial uncle, Lei Yunhe?

443
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,220
Why would he be

444
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:08,900
in Xueyue City

445
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,460
and become the Elder Keeper of the Tower?

446
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,220
This is...

447
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,980
Your clan leader, Lei Qianhu,

448
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:14,940
knows about this as well.

449
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,700
(Many times did he send his men)

450
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,300
(to bring him back home.)

451
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,660
(But Elder Lei refused to see anyone)

452
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,540
(from the Lei family.)

453
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,340
(As for the reason,)

454
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:23,980
(you'll know)

455
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,220
(when you meet him.)

456
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:38,300
[Lei Yunhe, Lei Clan]

457
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,460
Martial Uncle.

458
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,420
I'm sure

459
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,940
you're carrying the Shabu.

460
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,380
You're Lei Hong's disciple.

461
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,460
I, Lei Wujie, greet Martial Uncle.

462
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,260
Did Lei Hong send you here to see me?

463
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,460
Tell him

464
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,500
to stop wasting his time.

465
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:01,660
Martial Uncle,

466
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,700
I did not come to Xueyue City

467
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,500
to see you.

468
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,100
So you're here to upset me?

469
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:12,940
No, I...

470
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,020
I get it.

471
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,050
You're here to see that person.

472
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:18,540
All right.

473
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:20,700
I hope you can help me fulfill my wish.

474
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,780
If you want to see that person,

475
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,500
you only need to defeat me.

476
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,180
Then, Martial Uncle,

477
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:39,900
forgive me for offending you.

478
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,540
You can't get past my 15th floor

479
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,100
with your Fire Infusion.

480
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:58,500
Use your sword

481
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,500
and let me see

482
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,900
what kind of swordsmanship Lei Hong practiced

483
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,340
at the cost of violating the ancestral teaching.

484
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,100
Martial Uncle,

485
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:20,700
watch carefully!

486
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:42,580
Thunderclap Finger?

487
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:43,940
You lost.

488
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:46,940
Get down.

489
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,460
I challenge the trials

490
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,100
with the determination to win.

491
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,180
I ask that you don't hold back.

492
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,100
Shall we?

493
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:15,500
(This lad)

494
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,900
(only reached the Sturdy Phase.)

495
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,500
(Yet, he's so hard to get rid of.)

496
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:39,900
Hong,

497
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,660
have you heard about the Top-Rank List?

498
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,300
Are you talking about the list by Baixiao Sect?

499
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:45,780
In the future,

500
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,620
my name will be listed on that Top-Rank List.

501
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,140
My name

502
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,540
will be before yours.

503
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:54,620
We shall see.

504
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,100
I'll make a name for myself in this world!

505
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,740
Lad, don't push your luck.

506
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:19,700
Maybe

507
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:20,740
you're a genius

508
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,060
among the young generation

509
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,420
of the Lei Clan.

510
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,460
But after you enter the martial arts world,

511
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,100
there are many people

512
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,460
who can kill you instantly.

513
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,540
Don't be too arrogant.

514
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:33,060
I already know that.

515
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,180
On my journey to Xueyue City,

516
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,660
I met countless experts,

517
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,420
(seniors of the martial arts world,)

518
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,380
(mysterious people whose names I don't know,)

519
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:47,780
and also

520
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,580
(the real genius of my peers)

521
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,780

was defeated all the way here.

526
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:04,780
But I

527
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,060
can afford to lose.

528
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:09,900

But it's just because of a dispirited heart.

00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,220
This reminds me

563
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,220
of that power.

564
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,900
I'm the Nine Heavens Thunder,

565
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:59,700
which shocked heaven and earth!

566
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:04,100
♪It won't be lonely if I have my confidants♪

567
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,180
Who would have thought

568
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,500
the keeper of the 15th floor

569
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,660
was Lei Yunhe?

570
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:14,940
Lei Yunhe?

571
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,500
He's still alive?

572
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,140
Martial Uncle,

573
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,500
is Lei Yunhe very famous?

574
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,460
I've never heard the elders

575
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,580
talk about him before.

576
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,300
People from Mount Wangcheng

577
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,620
naturally aren't willing to talk about him.

578
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,460
Lei Yunhe used to be known

579
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,660
(as the Nine Heavens Thunder,)

580
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,700
(which shocked heaven and earth.)

581
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,380
(Together with Lei Mengsha,
Lei Qianhu, and Lei Hong,)

582
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,020
(they were called the Four Heroes of the Lei Clan.)

583
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,180
The most famous battle of that year

584
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,140
was at Mount Wangcheng.

585
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:46,900
After Lei Yunhe ascended the mountain,

586
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,860
he wanted to challenge Zhao Yuzhen to a fight.

587
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,180
[Mount Wangcheng]
(He first cut off the mountain path)

588
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:52,980
(and overturned the Qiankun Hall
in his second attack.)

589
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,020
(As for his third attack,)

590
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:56,260
(it went up against)

591
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,420
(Zhao Yuzhen's Qingxiao Sword.)

592
00:29:58,820 --> 00:29:59,980
(But he had one arm chopped off)

593
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:00,700
(by the sword.)

594
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,820
He disappeared without a trace

595
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,540
and never appeared

596
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,260
in the martial arts world again.

597
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,060
It's said he died from serious injuries.

598
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,380
I didn't expect him to be hiding in Xueyue City.

599
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:12,740
As the Elder Keeper of the Tower in Xueyue City,

600
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,220
with his capabilities,

601
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,220
it'll be hard even for a sword deity

602
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,020
to defeat him.

603
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,380
Elder Lei was heavily wounded back then.

604
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,220
He may have survived.

605
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:23,620
But the phase of his martial arts

606
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,900
has degraded.

607
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:25,940
At present,

608
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,180
he's only in the Carefree Phase.

609
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,100
I see.

610
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,500
But it looks like

611
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,580
he has got his phase back.

612
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:35,540
If so,

613
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,060
your friend

614
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,060
will be in trouble.

615
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:45,180
Yunhe,

616
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,780
congratulations
on reentering the Insouciant Phase.

617
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:48,980
But

618
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,420
we spent a lot of money

619
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,180
to build the Dengtian Tower.

620
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,820
I ask you to hold back.

621
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,380
If you strike a bolt of lightning,

622
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,620
Dengtian Tower

623
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,740
can't take the damage.

624
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,980
So what if I split

625
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:02,740
the Dengtian Tower?

626
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,700
Please.

627
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,020
Lad, you're not bad.

628
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:13,580
Martial Uncle, I don't deserve the praise.

629
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,500
Are you planning to go up the tower

630
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:16,980
and bring that person

631
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:18,620
to meet your master?

632
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:20,500
All right.

633
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,220
I'll go with you when that happens.

634
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:25,900
Li!

635
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:32,380
Yunhe,

636
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:34,260
since you've restored your power,

637
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,100
are you returning to the Lei family?

638
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:38,980
I'm too ashamed to return.

639
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,580
Why the same speech again?

640
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:41,980
I should pick up

641
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,860
where I fell off.

642
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,580
Only then, I'll think about going home.

643
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,860
I split Mount Cang at the first strike

644
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,220
and overturned Qiankun at the second.

645
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:52,940
Instead

646
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,220
of breaking Qingxiao Sword with my third strike,

647
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,180
I ended up losing an arm.

648
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,420
Now that I'm back in the Insouciant Phase,

649
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,860
how about I face Qingxiao Sword again?

650
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,620
Are you planning to go to Mount Wangcheng?

651
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,700
Li, let's go.

652
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,780
In those days, when I formed a spear with the storm

653
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,540
on top of this tower,

654
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,460
did I have such a graceful demeanor?

655
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:28,780
Not even half.

656
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:32,980
So I lost.

657
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,620
The world calls me Spear Deity.

658
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,340
But I don't have the imposing manner

659
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,420
where I can command the sky

660
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,300
and ride a crane.

661
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:43,580
Mister Spear Deity.

662
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,660
Lei Wujie,

663
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,420
are you going up the tower now?

664
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:49,580
I, Lei Wujie,

665
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,260
came to Xueyue City

666
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:51,660
to meet

667
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,940
Xueyue Sword Deity, Li Hanyi.

668
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,220
I hope you'll fulfill my request.

669
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:56,940
All right.

670
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:58,260
Take this.

671
00:32:59,500 --> 00:32:59,980
You'd better

672
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:00,940
don't let her beat you down in a flash.

673
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,460
It won't happen.

674
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,220
Why did Third City Lord and Mr. Tang

675
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,340
come down?

676
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,100
That's right.

677
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:08,820
Father! Lian!

678
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:09,980
Why did they?

679
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:10,980
Why did they come down?

680
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:11,540
What's going on?

681
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,260
Why are they here?

682
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:12,940
No idea.

683
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:15,660
Why did you come down here?

684
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,180
I thought Lei Wujie

685
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,300
was going up the tower.

686
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:23,900
He's here to meet someone.

687
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,380
He challenged the tower to meet someone?

688
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,580
Could that person be...

689
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:30,980
We'll just watch.

690
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,410
It'll be interesting.

691
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,860
Lei Wujie, the disciple of Lei Hong

692
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:37,540
from the Lei Fortress,

693
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:38,660
wishes to challenge Xueyue City

694
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,460
and meet Xueyue Sword Deity, Li Hanyi!

695
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,140
He wants to meet Li Hanyi?

696
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,220
Is he for real?

697
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,460
Is Xueyue Sword Deity

698
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,460
someone he can just meet?

699
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,980
Lei Wujie, the disciple of Lei Hong

700
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:50,940
from the Lei Fortress,

701
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,060
wishes to challenge Xueyue City

702
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:54,700
and meet Xueyue Sword Deity, Li Hanyi!

703
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:58,140
Father.

704
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,380
Lei Wujie, the disciple of Lei Hong

705
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,140
from the Lei Fortress,

706
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,180
wishes to challenge Xueyue City

707
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:08,460
and meet Xueyue Sword Deity, Li Hanyi!

708
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,020
That's embarrassing enough! Come down!

709
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,340
Just come down!

710
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:14,620
(I've called out to her many times.)

711
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,050
(But she doesn't even show up.)

712
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:17,540
Stop shouting! She's ignoring you!

713
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:18,580
(It's quite embarrassing.)

714
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:19,380
Just get down here!

715
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,060
(Screw it!)

716
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,580
(It wasn't easy to come up here.)

717
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:23,940
(I must see her!)

718
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:24,900
Lei Wujie...

719
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:25,540
Stop shouting!

720
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,100
You're so noisy!

721
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,140
Challenge Xueyue City?

722
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,260
With that butcher's sword

723
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,060
in your hand?

724
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,740
It's Shabu.

725
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,620
So here I am.

726
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,300
Draw your sword.

727
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:44,820
Let me see

728
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:46,700
what made you so confident

729
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,140
about challenging

730
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:48,780
Xueyue City.

731
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:49,900
All right.

732
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:57,540
I can't believe you're making

733
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,220
a spectacle of oneself with these sideshows.

734
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,500
You learned your sword techniques from Lei Hong.

735
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:22,100
The moves are bold and unconstrained.
They are indeed powerful.

736
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,100
You really need

737
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:24,820
more solid basic skills.

738
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,660
Or else, they will be full of flaws.

739
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:39,980
I heard you learned

740
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:40,940
the Formless Fist of the Lei family,

741
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:43,300
and you've also learned

742
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,300
a set of fist techniques
from Tianwaitian's Young Head.

743
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,620
With Fire Infusion,

744
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,420
two fist techniques,

745
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:50,820
and one secret art,

746
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,860
how much can you put your mind

747
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,220
into practicing your sword?

748
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,660
Is this how

749
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,500
that scoundrel Lei Hong taught you?

750
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:02,500
Master said

751
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,860
it's better to learn more skills
as we journey the martial arts world.

752
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,380
Nonsense!

753
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:07,980
When you journey the martial arts world,

754
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,500
it's already enough to master one skill.

755
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:11,820
Watch closely!

756
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,020
My Dengtian Tower!

757
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:36,540
Li Hanyi, you scoundrel!

758
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,180
Scoundrel!

759
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:46,340
Go!

760
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,820
So this is the power

761
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,180
of Sword Deity's one strike.

762
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:04,540
Are you all right?

763
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:06,180
I'm good.

764
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:08,940
You are...?

765
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:09,660
My name is Li Fansong.

766
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,020
I'm here to challenge the Dengtian Tower too.

767
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:13,700
Nice meeting you.

768
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,820
So this is the power of the Sword Deity.

769
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:17,820
It really gives me

770
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:18,700
goosebumps.

771
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,420
I really want to take this blow for myself.

772
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:21,780
You'll have the chance.

773
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:22,420
I'll be going off now!

774
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,660
I ask Li Hanyi, Xueyue Sword Deity, for a challenge!

775
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,380
But I'm the one challenging the tower now.

776
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:28,940
If you want to challenge the Sword Deity,

777
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,460
you need to start from the first floor!

778
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:31,820
Li Fansong, the disciple of Zhao Yuzhen,

779
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:32,940
came from Mount Wangcheng

780
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:33,980
to Xueyue City

781
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,700
to challenge Li Hanyi, Xueyue Sword Deity.

782
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,020
Please grant me guidance, Xueyue Sword Deity.

783
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,420
Ruthless Sword.

784
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:44,860
It's Infinite Sword!

785
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:46,460
Get down!

786
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,500
Li Hanyi, I'm going to get you for this!

787
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,220
-Father!
-Third Master.

788
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,020
Don't stop me!

789
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:55,660
Li Hanyi!

790
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,940
My Dengtian Tower!

791
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:00,060
Go!

792
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:04,460
Li Hanyi,

793
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:06,820
pay me back my Dengtian Tower!

794
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,580
I'll make you pay for it!

795
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,500
My Dengtian Tower, Qianluo.

796
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:13,980
Li Hanyi,

797
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,180
wait there!

798
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,020
I'll get you for this!

799
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,340
Are you all right?

800
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,220
It hurts.

801
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,300
I can't beat her.

802
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,540
You're right about that.

803
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:39,900
How about

804
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,180
we fight her together?

805
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,100

00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,460
