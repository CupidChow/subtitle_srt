We have run this inn

192
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,520
Who are you?

193
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,560
I'm Xiao Se.

194
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,920
The owner of Snowfall Villa.

195
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:18,720
I don't have money.

196
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,040
But you

197
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,640
sure do.

198
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,640
Truth be told,

199
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,000
this inn has been

200
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,040
having no customers for a month.

201
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,360
I can hardly pay my workers now.

202
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:36,720
I don't care.

203
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:37,920
Even if you don't have the money,

204
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,640
your fur coat

205
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,960
is worth more than a hundred silver taels.

206
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:41,880
You're wrong.

207
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,720
An expensive steed

208
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,640
and a costly fur coat.

209
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,880
My coat

210
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,600
was made

211
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,920
by Yuxiu Boutique in Tianqi City.

212
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,320
It took three months to make it

213
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,040
and

214
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,600
another month to deliver it to me.

215
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,280
One hundred silver taels?

216
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,720
That's not even enough for my sleeves.

217
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,560
You...

218
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,400
So,

219
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,960
did you get my message now?

220
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,440
Two silver taels.

221
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,640
What two silver taels?

222
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,200
This table

223
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,800
costs two silver taels.

224
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:17,760
You...

225
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,320
I'm here to rob you.

226
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,400
Not to eat.

227
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,920
Give me the best liquor

228
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:22,960
and the best meat.

229
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,760
Then, hand me whatever is worthy.

230
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:25,840
Otherwise,

231
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,240
I'll kill your people

232
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,320
and burn your inn.

233
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,240
A robbery?

234
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,200
I have to intervene then.

235
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:35,920
Who are you?

236
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,240
Lei Wujie.

237
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,000
Lei Wujie?

238
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:39,840
That's right.

239
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,200
Who?

240
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:44,960
No idea.

241
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:45,720
Who is Lei Wujie?

242
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,640
Never heard of him.

243
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,600
Does he ring a bell?

244
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,200
I just started to travel the martial arts world,

245
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,360
so naturally, you don't

246
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,080
know my name.

247
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,320
However,

248
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,800
it's no matter.

249
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,080
Soon,

250
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,160
my name will...

251
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,200
Just a nameless brat.

252
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:02,840
Hit him!

253
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,040
The weaponless.

254
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,960
Jiangnan Thunderbolt Sect?

255
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:26,800
The Lei Clan?

256
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:27,840
I'm Lei Wujie

257
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:29,800
of the Lei family.

258
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,120
Kill him!

259
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,680
That was my Formless Fist.

260
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:23,520
Of course,

261
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:24,880
I have something

262
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,840
more impressive.

263
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,160
♪Pursuing the dream of our youth♪

264
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,160
♪We take everything as it comes♪

265
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,160
♪The distant land might be dangerous♪

266
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,920
♪But what's life without an adventure?♪

267
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,000
♪Youths are supposed to dream big and be sharp♪

268
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,400
♪Every struggle in life has taught us♪

269
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,040
♪That we shall do what we can wherever we go♪

270
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,360
♪Together, another journey awaits♪

271
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,320
So?

272
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,240
Do you know who I am now?

273
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,360
Get lost now.

274
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,160
Let's go.

275
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,840
Come on.

276
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,400
You're welcome.

277
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,600
I have to intervene.

278
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,920
It's my duty.

279
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:35,880
So no need to thank me.

280
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,320
I have to go now.

281
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,160
May we meet again.

282
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,920
No need to thank you?

283
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,960
You have to intervene?

284
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,320
Of course.

285
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,720
If it weren't for me,

286
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,320
those bandits

287
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,520
would have trashed your inn.

288
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,520
You might have lost your life too.

289
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,760
Shouldn't you thank me?

290
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,560
Look at my inn.

291
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,440
Is it not trashed already?

292
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,240
Well...

293
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,600
One hundred silver taels.

294
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,080
I don't have money.

295
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,480
But...

296
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,240
Either way,

297
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,360
I did save your life.

298
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,560
You're just...

299
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,960
Do I look like I need your help?

300
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,040
This technique...

301
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,960
One hundred silver taels.

302
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,640
I really don't have money.

303
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:30,440
You don't?

304
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,040
But I

305
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,760
will have money soon.

306
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,120
I just have to go to this place.

307
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,560
Then, I'll have money.

308
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,280
What place?

309
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,320
Xueyue City.

310
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,280
Xueyue City?

311
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,200
(Xueyue City.)

312
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,520
(The biggest city in the martial arts world.)

313
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,680
(It houses the alliance formed by several)

314
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,600
(prestigious clans.)

315
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,920
(Jiangnan Thunderbolt Sect)

316
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,320
(is one of them.)

317
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,640
(To reclaim what is mine,)

318
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,800
(I have to visit)

319
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,320
(that city too.)

320
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,920
(If he)

321
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,240
(is visiting the city too,)

322
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,200
(knowing his identity,)

323
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,440
(he can easily)

324
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,800
(procure 100 silver taels)

325
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,240
(for me.)

326
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,200
(And he)

327
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,520
(doesn't look like he's lying either.)

328
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,600
(Honestly,)

329
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,280
(he might know one powerful technique or two,)

330
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,920
(but he still looks like an idiot.)

331
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:27,520
Sure.

332
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,640
You're visiting Xueyue City.

333
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,000
And I'll go with you.

334
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,590
No problem.

335
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:33,720
Also,

336
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:35,720
as for the interest rate,

337
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,800
let's make it 500 silver taels.

338
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,560
Five hundred?

339
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,080
(I have stayed at this place for many years.)

340
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,760
(The meeting with those several city lords)

341
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,720
(is long overdue too.)

342
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,920
(Time to revisit what happened that year.)

343
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,720
The freshly fermented wine is sprinkled
with green foam

344
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,880
while the red clay pot slowly burns.

345
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,800
A snowfall is impending.

346
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,120
Would you care to drink with me?

347
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,560
I like your proposition,

348
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,080
so I would gladly drink with you.

349
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,160
However, this horse carriage

350
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,560
will stay here.

351
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,240
Do you know

352
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,440
what it

353
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,920
contains?

354
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,400
Valuables.

355
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,920
You

356
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,280
are not wrong per se.

357
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:42,920
Enough.

358
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,720
Hand it over now.

359
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,080
Otherwise...

360
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,920
[Tang Lian, Xueyue City]
You followed me

361
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,720
in this heavy snow.

362
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,640
I feel bad for you.

363
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,720
But your endeavor

364
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,520
is destined to fail.

365
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:56,880
I think

366
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,320
you should drink with me first

367
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:00,840
and...

368
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,200
Finger dagger.

369
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,160
Perhaps, your client

370
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,000
didn't tell you

371
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,400
who I am.

372
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:28,960
This payload

373
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,440
will not be intercepted

374
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,640
by the likes of you.

375
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,040
You're from the Tang Clan of Shu?

376
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:17,960
I wonder

377
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,280
what Master asked me to deliver.

378
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,200
It

379
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,240
has attracted so many powerful foes.

380
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:38,680
Who's there?

381
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,200
Tang Lian...

382
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,240
of Xueyue City.

383
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,160
You know my name.

384
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,760
We will meet again.

385
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,320
Stop right there.

386
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,160
What an eccentric person.

387
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,080
A white-haired man with a jade sword
and exceptional qinggong techniques.

388
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,880
Master never told me

389
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,280
of such a person.

390
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,160
It snows so heavily.

391
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,320
When will it

392
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,200
stop?

393
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,520
Fortunately,

394
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,000
my horse is a fine steed.

395
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,080
Otherwise,

396
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,160
we will be buried under the snow.

397
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,080
Wait.

398
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,040
You keep telling me

399
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:33,760
how well your horse performs.

400
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,160
Are you a horse seller?

401
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,160
Cut the crap.

402
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,600
Go in and start a fire.

403
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,400
Pretentious.

404
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,440
Someone was here.

405
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:10,960
Great.

406
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,200
That's convenient.

407
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,320
I was worried that the firewood

408
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,520
would be too wet for it.

409
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,000
(Just two)

410
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,240
(ordinary travelers then?)

411
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,200
Hurry up.

412
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,080
Lei Wujie.

413
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,200
You said you would bring me to Xueyue City.

414
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,480
But you

415
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,080
have taken two wrong turns so far.

416
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,320
Are you sure we're heading in the right direction?

417
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,840
It's actually my first time

418
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,720
visiting Xueyue City.

419
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:51,840
But I swear

420
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,840
I got it right this time.

421
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,080
(His last name is Lei.)

422
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,320
(Is he)

423
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,480
(from the Lei family
of Jiangnan Thunderbolt Sect?)

424
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,800
(But Lei Wujie...)

425
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,320
(I have never heard of him.)

426
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,200
Is dog your Chinese zodiac sign?

427
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,480
What are you sniffing?

428
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,560
Did you smell something?

429
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,400
What smell?

430
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:23,720
A floral scent.

431
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,800
It's baby rose.

432
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,200
Baby rose?

433
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,600
It doesn't bloom during winter.

434
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,270
It's a scent of baby rose dew.

435
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,560
Baby rose dew.

436
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,520
From Taziks,

437
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,400
Champa, and Java.

438
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,240
Only the Baihua Perfumery

439
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,800
in Tianqi City sells it.

440
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,320
You shouldn't find it here.

441
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,360
I didn't expect to come across

442
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,120
a man of fine taste in this secluded place.

443
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,040
I implored the owner of Baihua Perfumery
for many days

444
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,920
before she sold it to me.

445
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,000
And you detected it right away.

446
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,560
It's breezy and chilly.

447
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,160
Do you want to come in?

448
00:22:59,480 --> 00:22:59,960
No need.

449
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,080
This is...

450
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,600
[Death]

451
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,400
[Yueji]
Yueji greets

452
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,640
and Minghou kills.

453
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,960
[Minghou]

454
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,200
That's right.

455
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,440
That's right!

456
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,120
What is right?

457
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,160
They

458
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,200
are Yueji and Minghou.

459
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,920
Ranked ninth in the League of Assassins.

460
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,960
The first eight places

461
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,480
are occupied by members of Dark River.

462
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:29,880
So they

463
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,640
are the strongest killer duo
in the martial arts world at the moment.

464
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:33,880
In that case,

465
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,680
they just greeted us,

466
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,440
so are they going...

467
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,480
They are going to kill us.

468
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,200
Why are you so excited?

469
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,520
That was to greet

470
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,720
another friend inside.

471
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,880
However, our rule is

472
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,400
that whoever accepts the card will have to die.

473
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,640
So please

474
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,480
die here.

475
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,640
I accepted your card once,

476
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,520
but here I am.

477
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,880
May I know your name?

478
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,360
Tang Lian.

479
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,400
That's why we're here

480
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,200
to kill you.

481
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,040
Tang Lian?

482
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,400
You're Tang Lian?

483
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,040
The most outstanding disciple of Xueyue City?

484
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,120
In that case,

485
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,000
you're my eldest martial brother.

486
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,040
I'm Lei Wujie.

487
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,240
From the Lei Fortress

488
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,200
of Jiangnan Thunderbolt Sect.

489
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,000
I'm also a disciple.

490
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:31,760
Careful.

491
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,840
Minghou is reticent.

492
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,160
He hates blabbermouth.

493
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,040
Such a huge blade.

494
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,200
You're injured.

495
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,280
And your Baixiang poison

496
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,160
hasn't been treated either.

497
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,200
Otherwise, the slash from just now...

498
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:09,960
You won't be able

499
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,040
to take the next hit.

500
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,000
Then I will.

501
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,720
My martial brother protected me once.

502
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,640
So it's my turn now.

503
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,240
You

504
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,440
serve Xueyue City too?

505
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,920
Then I can kill you too.

506
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,680
However, Minghou's claymore isn't for everyone,

507
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,640
so have a taste of my sword first.

508
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,440
Belt Sword?

509
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,400
They have matching

510
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,240
weapons.

511
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,040
Belt Sword

512
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,080
and the Golden Claymore.

513
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,800
Not many can see

514
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,320
these two weapons in one night.

515
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,080
Watch closely now, young man.

516
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,840
They say the Jiangnan Thunderbolt Sect

517
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,760
has the best firearms.

518
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,040
But your inner force

519
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,120
is not too shabby either.

520
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,760
You could catch my sword

521
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,880
with your bare hands.

522
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,520
I have seen your sword,

523
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,720
but you haven't seen

524
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,960
my fist.

525
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,440
The Formless First of the Lei Clan.

526
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,160
The pressure wave arrives before the fist does.

527
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,320
He

528
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,360
is strong.

529
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,400
Lunar Thrust, Shadow Disguise.

530
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,680
They are strong techniques for assassination.

531
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,160
But what good are they

532
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,800
if they can't

533
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,320
eliminate the target?

534
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:24,800
I lost.

535
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,320
You won

536
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,640
just now.

537
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,440
You must be joking.

538
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,400
For an assassin, there's no winning or losing,

539
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,880
only living and dying.

540
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,840
I just entered the martial arts world

541
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,320
and I could fight an opponent like you.

542
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,120
How lucky am I?

543
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,160
This is...

544
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,960
Fire Infusion from the Lei family.

545
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,920
(No wonder his hair turns red.)

546
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:51,720
Yueji.

547
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,360
Let's go.

548
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,160
You're leaving already?

549
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:39,920
How odd.

550
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,480
They had the upper hand.

551
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,680
Why did they leave?

552
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,160
If you charge at any attack thrown at you,

553
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,320
you won't have

554
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,160
enough lives to live.

555
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,680
You can fight too.

556
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,760
Why didn't you help me?

557
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,360
When did I say

558
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,120
I could fight?

559
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:54,600
But

560
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,800
you waved your hand

561
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,800
in your inn

562
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,360
and all windows and doors shut on their own.

563
00:29:59,120 --> 00:29:59,760
Idiot.

564
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,000
Other than martial arts,

565
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,600
there's also something called a mechanism.

566
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,600
Do I look like I need your help?

567
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,720
What?

568
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,240
Mister.

569
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:16,560
Did you hide something

570
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,480
in the backyard?

571
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,600
Someone snuck in there.

572
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,160
I think Minghou and Yueji

573
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,520
knew they were being

574
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,520
used as bait.

575
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,270
Let's go.

576
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,000
Why?

577
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,840
Aren't we going to Xueyue City?

578
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,360
The First Disciple of Xueyue City

579
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,240
is in front of us.

580
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,480
I'd rather follow him

581
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:41,960
than your lousy lead.

582
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,200
Right.

583
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,240
Only cowards

584
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,200
would pull a dirty trick like this.

585
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,920
I beg your pardon, Tang Lian?

586
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,840
Who is a coward here?

587
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,000
Protect my eldest martial brother!

588
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,400
Qianluo.

589
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,120
Does Third Master know you're here?

590
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,960
Don't tell me you snuck out.

591
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:22,840
Of course not.

592
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,400
I'm on an adventure now,

593
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,040
and I merely passed by here.

594
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,720
What is happening?

595
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,160
She snuck out.

596
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,200
I have a task at hand.

597
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,800
I will write to Third Master and ask him

598
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,040
to bring you back.

599
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,600
[Sikong Qianluo]
How dare you, Tang Lian.

600
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,760
Lian.

601
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:54,840
Fine.

602
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,880
We will settle this in the future.

603
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:07,560
Tang Lian.

604
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,600
Just you wait!

605
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,240
She is...?

606
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:12,720
Sikong Qianluo.

607
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,720
Sikong.

608
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,520
The daughter

609
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,600
of the Spear Deity, Sikong Changfeng?

610
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,760
Yes, she's my Third Master's daughter.

611
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,080
Also the Young Lady of Xueyue City.

612
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,680
What a surprise.

613
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,120
Qianluo...

614
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,360
went overboard this time.

615
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:48,760
What are you doing?

616
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,200
The sound doesn't lie.

617
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,080
It's pure gold.

618
00:32:59,200 --> 00:32:59,840
Pure gold?

619
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,440
So?

620
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,960
It's worth a lot of money.

621
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,080
We just met

622
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,960
and you would trust us already?

623
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,800
I don't trust you.

624
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,720
I trust him.

625
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,120
Well,

626
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,160
we share the same opinion.

627
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,480
He

628
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,720
has the techniques

629
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,840
but not the brain.

630
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,280
He is incapable

631
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,520
of lying.

632
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:38,800
And you?

633
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:39,640
Me?

634
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,200
I gave you my two best

635
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,120
Yebei Steed

636
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,600
to pull the carriage.

637
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:44,960
Is that not enough?

638
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,160
Martial Brother.

639
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,320
Ignore him.

640
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,840
He's just a horse merchant.

641
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:49,840
He keeps saying

642
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,280
how good his horses are

643
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,000
and nothing else.

644
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,040
Lei.

645
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,320
You're not one of the disciples.

646
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,720
So please refrain

647
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:58,880
from using

648
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,120
martial brother

649
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:00,960
to call me.

650
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,640
Sure, Martial Brother.

651
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,600
So you don't know

652
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,880
what the coffin contains?

653
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,080
Master didn't tell me.

654
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,160
He just told me to escort it

655
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,360
to Jiulong Sect of Biluo City.

656
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:14,760
Besides,

657
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,920
he also told me...

658
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,280
Told you what?

659
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:19,960
Do not ever

660
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,280
open this coffin.

661
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,840
Now,

662
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,960
you make me

663
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:30,920
all curious.

664
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,800
Don't be.

665
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,280
I have run into

666
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,760
more than ten groups of assassins.

667
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:36,760
Many people

668
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,960
are coveting its content.

669
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,560
Possessing it

670
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,560
brings misfortune.

671
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,480
So your wounds

672
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,560
came from those people.

673
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,160
(No, from Yueji and Minghou.)

674
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,520
(Others)

675
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,400
(are just...)

676
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,200
I have heard

677
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,560
the rumor

678
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,840
of the Golden Coffin.

679
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,320
What have you heard?

680
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,360
Don't look at me like that.

681
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,240
The rumor

682
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,840
is already spreading.

683
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,520
There are all sorts of rumors.

684
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,200
But in general,

685
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,240
someone is delivering the Golden Coffin

686
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,880
from Hanshui Temple to the border.

687
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,280
The coffin contains

688
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,840
boundless valuables

689
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,720
and powerful martial arts

690
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,560
to rule the world.

691
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,080
Do you believe it?

692
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,280
I didn't.

693
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,320
But when I see

694
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,320
the First Disciple of Xueyue City,

695
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,240
Tang Lian, escorting

696
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,080
the Golden Coffin...

697
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,920
So what?

698
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,560
To circulate

699
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,920
this rumor widely,

700
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,520
someone

701
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,040
has to make an effort.

702
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,240
Assassins like Minghou and Yueji

703
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,120
can't

704
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,600
achieve that.

705
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,120
I'm sure you also heard

706
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,520
that several months ago,

707
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,440
Abbot Wangyou of Hanshui Temple passed away.

708
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,440
I bet his body

709
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,960
is in the coffin.

710
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,480
But why do so many people

711
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,600
want it?

712
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,320
Who exactly are you?

713
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,280
I'm just

714
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,040
an innkeeper

715
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,280
who knows many things.

716
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,280
So where are we going?

717
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,920
Jiulong Sect?

718
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,680
Belle's Manor of Three-Gaze City.

719
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,280
Three gazes.

720
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,080
The first gaze makes the city fall for the beauty.

721
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,920
The second gaze brings the nation to its knee.

722
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,200
The third gaze steals my heart.

723
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,200
To go to Biluo City, we will definitely pass by

724
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:35,960
Three-Gaze City.

725
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,240
Many merchants

726
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,160
pass by here every year,

727
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,280
many of which

728
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,360
are huge gamblers.

729
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,720
Belle's Manor

730
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,160
is the biggest gambling den in the city.

731
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,360
[Belle's Manor]

732
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,440
It is a brothel

733
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,160
and one of the few

734
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,640
gambling houses...

735
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,240
In Beili.

736
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,200
Unfortunately,

737
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,320
Lei Wujie

738
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,280
is on guard duty now.

739
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,960
Otherwise, we should bring him here

740
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,720
to show him the real world.

741
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,800
Belle's Manor is the biggest brothel

742
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,880
in Three-Gaze City.

743
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:13,840
Its patrons

744
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,840
are the rich among the rich.

745
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,520
They gamble with

746
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,840
astronomical figures
that normal chips won't cut it.

747
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,240
Therefore, they gamble

748
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,760
in pearl boxes.

749
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,240
We're already here anyway.

750
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,520
Should we have a round?

751
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,040
I don't have money.

752
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,240
Really?

753
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,640
We

754
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,720
have a pure gold coffin.

755
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:38,840
Hush.

756
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:40,600
I'm warning you.

757
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,880
Don't ever think about that.

758
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,040
I'm here

759
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,280
to seek my liaison.

760
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,600
So avoid unnecessary attention.

761
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,640
It's Fairy Rui!

762
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:30,280
[Fairy Rui, Belle's Manor]

763
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,160
Isn't this Lian?

764
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,320
Didn't you say

765
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,800
we should avoid unnecessary attention?

766
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,880
But look,

767
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,480
all eyes

768
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,800
are on us.

769
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:45,520
Rui.

770
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,200
Lian.

771
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,440
It's been 16 months

772
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:52,680
and 7 days

773
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,160
since your last visit.

774
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,280
How cold-hearted of you.

775
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,040
Rui

776
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,840
and Lian.

777
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,520
It sounds

778
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,520
like an old couple.

779
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,400
A dashing lad, you are.

780
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,000
I heard

781
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,120
you said you wanted a round.

782
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,800
And tonight,

783
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,160
there's a rare game going on here.

784
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,680
Do you want to play?

785
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,440
I don't have money.

786
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,000
No.

787
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,040
You have money.

788
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,960
How do you know, miss?

789
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,480
A commoner

790
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,840
will gawk

791
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,560
in a huge gambling house like this one

792
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,960
and will fawn

793
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,080
over a beauty like me.

794
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:34,840
But you

795
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,280
look so disinterested.

796
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,600
As if the overwhelming beauty

797
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,240
and riches here

798
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,760
are nothing

799
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,600
but common occurrences to you.

800
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,320
So,

801
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,160
aren't you rich?

802
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:49,880
Rui.

803
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,640
We don't have time for this.

804
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,280
Your liaison has not arrived,

805
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,200
but everything is ready.

806
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:00,800
Be careful.

807
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,360
Many top assassins

808
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,360
visit Three-Gaze City

809
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,400
for

810
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,480
the item.

811
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,520
Some of them

812
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,880
can be quite tricky to handle.

813
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,240
Mister, do you still fancy a game?

814
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,560
I own an inn

815
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,960
called Snowfall.

816
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,440
It's worth 10 pearl boxes.

817
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,080
Miss,

818
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,320
would you lend me them then?

819
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,160
Sure.

820
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,400
This gentleman

821
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,680
has reserved the entire Belle's Manor tonight.

822
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,360
If you want to gamble, you stay.

823
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,760
If you don't want to gamble, please leave.

824
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,960
You must be joking, Fairy Rui.

825
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,520
Two pearl boxes

826
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,000
are enough to reserve the entire manor?

827
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,520
He looks

828
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,880
like a first-timer,

829
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,160
so he doesn't know the rules here.

830
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,880
But not you too, Fairy Rui.

831
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,240
You think so?

832
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,280
What mistake did I commit?

833
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,040
Come on.

834
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,680
It's all a scare tactic.

835
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,680
Why did I do that?

836
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:29,880
Because I want

837
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,880
everyone here to know

838
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,480
that the stake for this round

839
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,200
isn't just money.

840
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,400
You mean...

841
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,800
Life too?

842
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:38,960
Yes.

843
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,200
Gambling with your life...

844
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,360
What does she mean?

845
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,200
I'm sure you can guess it already.

846
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,400
The loser will lose money

847
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,000
and his life.

848
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:52,880
When did I

849
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:53,600
agree to that?

850
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,760
I know

851
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,000
you're protecting

852
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,440
your beau here.

853
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,320
But you should know

854
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,920
that this manor

855
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,040
won't be enough.

856
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,280
It's you.

857
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,440
We meet again,

858
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,400
Tang Lian.

859
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,600
But she is right.

860
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,680
If you want to play, you stay.

861
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,800
If not,

862
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,800
you leave.

863
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,320
Let's go now.

864
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,560
Hand over it now.

865
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:30,480
Now!

866
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,080
Interesting.

867
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,240
They

868
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:33,560
[Lu Yuzhai, Wushuang City]
don't even know

869
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,760
what the Golden Coffin contains.

870
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,960
Hand it out now.

871
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,320
And they just have to meddle in this.

872
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:39,640
Hurry up now!

873
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,240
