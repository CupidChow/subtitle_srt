00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:43,820
He must be out of his mind.

190
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,340
Repel Thunder.

191
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,300
Judging from your technique,

192
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,300
you must come from the same sect
as the one who rides a crane.

193
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:57,860
The Lei family

194
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:58,700
is truly interesting.

195
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,340
Why do you always want to come to

196
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:00,980
Mount Wangcheng?

197
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,380
Try this technique for size.

198
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,460
I inherited this sword art from a sword deity.
It's called Beautiful Day.

199
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,700
Zhao Yuzhen is protected by zhenqi.

200
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,020
You won't be able to harm him

201
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:35,940
no matter what you do.

202
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,340
You're her disciple indeed.

203
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,500
Did she tell you to come see me?

204
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:44,820
How is she doing?

205
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,140
I was just trying to vent my sister's anger

206
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:46,940
on her behalf.

207
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,140
You're her younger brother?

208
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:49,700
You have so many questions.

209
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,340
Why don't you ask her yourself?

210
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,140
She said

211
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,420
she wanted me to follow her down the mountain

212
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:57,980
after her third visit.

213
00:09:58,820 --> 00:09:59,740
I've been waiting for her for many years.

214
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,340
But she never came.

215
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,180
She came.

216
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,580
She did?

217
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,100
That's impossible.

218
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,740
I know everything there is to know

219
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,700
on this mountain.

220
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,580
I'd have known if she had been here.

221
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,820
Back then, you were cultivating in seclusion.

222
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,460
After that, Lei Yunhe came here

223
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,420
to challenge you.

224
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,180
(You broke one of his arms and chased him off.)

225
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,220
(However, you were seriously wounded too.)

226
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,820
(You almost went berserk.)

227
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,740
You rested and recuperated

228
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,700
with the support of all celestial masters.

229
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,340
(During that period,)

230
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,300
(Li Hanyi did come.)

231
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,060
(The entire Mount Wangcheng)

232
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,460
(should know about it.)

233
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:57,300
[Mount Wangcheng]

234
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,100
But...

235
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,300
I truly have no idea.

236
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,220
Master,

237
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,620
back then, I wasn't your disciple yet.

238
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,340
Grand Martial Uncle, back then,

239
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,340
I wasn't born yet.

240
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,100
Yuzhen.

241
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:20,740
Martial Uncle Yin.

242
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:21,980
Martial Uncle Yin,

243
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:22,780
what exactly is going on?

244
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,060
Do you remember

245
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,980
the last day of your master's

246
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:27,860
cultivation in seclusion?

247
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:30,980
Yuzhen,

248
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,460
you cannot leave the mountain.

249
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,580
I've predicted your destiny.

250
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,820
Master, I've never doubted your words.

251
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,580
No one has ever won against the heavens.

252
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,420
However, I wish to try

253
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,340
and see if I can deceive the heavens.

254
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:48,740
How?

255
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,020
Try to reach the Unbeatable Phase.

256
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,220
The Unbeatable Phase?

257
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:55,820
Once you do so,

258
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:56,980
even the heavens

259
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,460
can no longer restrict you.

260
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,100
In order to help you achieve that phase,

261
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,420
the entire Mount Wangcheng was sealed off

262
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,980
and no one was allowed to enter the mountain.

263
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,460
But on that day,

264
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,420
Lei Hong came and demanded a duel with you.

265
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,220
Our disciples couldn't stop him.

266
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,100
Just as he was about to enter the mountain,

267
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,980
Li Hanyi came.

268
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,340
I was too ignorant.

269
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,460
You should return.

270
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,780
I will pay you a visit

271
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,060
when you become a sword deity.

272
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,100
However, you shall not

273
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,660
enter Mount Wangcheng today.

274
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:34,820
[Mount Wangcheng]

275
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,540
[Mount Wangcheng]
Sword deity?

276
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,180
I will definitely become a sword deity.

277
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:47,380
[Gate of Mist]

278
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,100
How is he doing?

279
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,060
He has regained consciousness

280
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,460
with the help of the celestial masters.

281
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,380
However, it will take a long time

282
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,300
for him to recover.

283
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:01,500
Okay.

284
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,140
Master Lyu,

285
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,540
please tell him that I was here.

286
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,100
You should know

287
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,380
what happened next.

288
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,300
In the end, you could not win against the heavens.

289
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,660
Both you and Master Lyu were hurt.

290
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,660
Master Lyu passed away not long after that.

291
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,700
Since then, no one spoke about it.

292
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,140
Why did no one speak about it?

293
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:22,620
My sister is a prideful person.

294
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,460
She couldn't bring him away

295
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,300
after three visits.

296
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,260
She might

297
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:25,980
never come again.

298
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,340
Saint Zhao,

299
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,100
we're heading to the hero banquet
held by the Lei Clan.

300
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,260
Xueyue Sword Deity

301
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,180
will join us.

302
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,540
Will you join us?

303
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,260
And my master.

304
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,460
He is Lei Hong.

305
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,620
He's a member of the Lei Clan too.

306
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:39,420
Kiddo,

307
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,020
what will happen

308
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,180
if I don't leave the mountain?

309
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,340
My sister might meet my master.

310
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,820
And my master might not

311
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,500
let her leave him again.

312
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,020
And what if I leave the mountain?

313
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,340
Everything will be under your control.

314
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,220
You're right.

315
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,820
So, are you leaving the mountain or not?

316
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,140
In the Peach Blossom Village,
there is a peach blossom hut.

317
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,180
A peach blossom lover lives
in the peach blossom hut.

318
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,620
From day to day half-drunk, half-sober he'd appear.

319
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:16,180
The peach flowers
blossom and fall from year to year.

320
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,260
You guys should leave.

321
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:24,580
What...

322
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,420
Let's go then.

323
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,980
What's with him and his stupid poem?

324
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,660
Will Zhao Yuzhen

325
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,860
leave the mountain or not?

326
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,180
No one can tell

327
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,420
what is on my master's mind.

328
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,020
Will a huge change occur

329
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,260
if your master does leave the mountain?

330
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,020
Master hasn't left

331
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:51,900
the mountain before.

332
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,140
So no one knows.

333
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,140
Maybe

334
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,100
my great master tricked him

335
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,780
so that he would stay

336
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,580
in Mount Wangcheng forever.

337
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,380
Great Master isn't as dumb as you.

338
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,140
Masters of the sect
have their lives determined by the heavens.

339
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,020
What Great Master had said

340
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:07,780
might be true.

341
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,580
Determined by the heavens?

342
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,660
Enough already.

343
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,660
Whether Zhao Yuzhen comes or not

344
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:14,820
depends on your sister

345
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,210
and himself.

346
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,500
It has nothing to do with you.

347
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,300
You'd already said

348
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:19,980
what you were supposed to say.

349
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,580
We should leave now.

350
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,540
No matter if it's Li Hanyi

351
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,420
or Zhao Yuzhen,

352
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,260
with their powers

353
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,140
that can help them travel 1,000 li per day,

354
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,580
heading to Lei Fortress

355
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,740
is a piece of cake to them.

356
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,620
But us?

357
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,580
We'll be laughingstocks if we don't depart now.

358
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,180
Let's go.

359
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,220
You're right.

360
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,340
I don't know anything

361
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:37,940
about the heavens.

362
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:38,980
I only believe in one thing.

363
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,660
When there's a will, there's a way.

364
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:41,780
Farewell.

365
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,020
Farewell.

366
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,660
I forgot to ask you something.

367
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,500
How did you convince your sister

368
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,740
to meet Lei Hong together with you?

369
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:53,980
Judging from her personality,

370
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:54,900
she'll never agree to it.

371
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,620
Actually, I deceived Hanyi.

372
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:00,380
You know how to deceive people?

373
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,100
I lied to her

374
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,860
and said that my master

375
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:04,900
is terminally ill.

376
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,300
I said he wants to see her

377
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,100
and have no regrets

378
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,180
before he dies.

379
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,460
That's how Hanyi agreed to it.

380
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,100
Does your master

381
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:11,940
know that you jinxed him?

382
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,500
He won't care about anything I say

383
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,780
as long as he can see Hanyi.

384
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,500
Lei Wujie, I didn't expect this from you.

385
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,340
I guess you've turned cunning too.

386
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,580
You flatter me. You're an expert yourself.

387
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,060
Last question.

388
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,220
Are you sure you know the way to Lei Fortress?

389
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:28,580
Don't worry.

390
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,580
I've lived in Lei Fortress

391
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,300
for over a decade.

392
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,660
I remember its scent.

393
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,460
So I will never forget it.

394
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:36,820
Follow me.

395
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,740
You're heading the wrong way. Come back.

396
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:55,460
Look for yourself.

397
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,620
You're an idiot.

398
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,660
That person isn't Xiao Chuhe.

399
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,300
Xiao Chuhe has been nowhere to be found
for four years.

400
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,860
If he appears again,

401
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,140
he'll definitely be different.

402
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,100
Have you seen him before?

403
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:16,740
I once saw him from a long distance

404
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,860
when I was in Tianqi City.

405
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,100
Back then, I received an order

406
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,100
to kill him.

407
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,420
However, someone acted first.

408
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:24,940
I thought he was dead

409
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,940
all these years.

410
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,900
Does the Leader know about this?

411
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,610
It doesn't matter

412
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:33,380
if the Leader knows about this.

413
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,460
It doesn't matter if that Xiao Chuhe

414
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,340
is the real deal or not.

415
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,940
Dark River just needs an opportunity

416
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,900
to set foot in Tianqi City.

417
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:43,940
You're right.

418
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,940
We've been living in darkness

419
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,100
for too long.

420
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:48,580
Are you going

421
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,660
to kill those two youngsters?

422
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,340
It's a waste

423
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,020
of your talent.

424
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,620
I will head southward

425
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,500
to stop someone.

426
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,700
It seems like that person

427
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,580
is heading to Lei Clan too.

428
00:17:58,940 --> 00:17:59,940
She's a variable

429
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:00,860
in this operation.

430
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,060
What kind of person is she

431
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,140
for you to be so cautious?

432
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,740
It's Li Hanyi, the Xueyue Sword Deity.

433
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,140
Who are you guys?

434
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:10,460
Why are you

435
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,140
blocking our path?

436
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:12,780
Lei Wujie,

437
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,180
these people are different

438
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,020
from the ones we used to see.

439
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:16,740
You need to understand something.

440
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,100
They're here to take lives.

441
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,060
Who exactly are they?

442
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:22,780
Dark River.

443
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,420
Dark River?

444
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,140
Do you mean the assassin syndicate

445
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,060
that's occupied the top eight slots
of the League of Assassins?

446
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,020
That's right, my surname is Su.

447
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,020
[Su Changli, Dark River]
I'm Su Changli of the Su family.

448
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,420
It's my first time seeing assassins

449
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,500
who tell us about their names.

450
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:37,820
I told you guys my name

451
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,300
because you guys

452
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:39,980
will die soon.

453
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,740
(Su Changli. He's an expert with big swords.)

454
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,220
(He has a dominant aura.)

455
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,860
(Seems like he's the leader of the bunch.)

456
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:01,460
Xiao Se,

457
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:02,820
this is interesting.

458
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:04,980
The first opponents

459
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,700
we met on our adventure

460
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:06,860
were assassins too.

461
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:08,580
But this time,

462
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,420
Lian isn't around.

463
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,420
We can only depend on ourselves.

464
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:12,860
You're wrong.

465
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,100
We can only depend on you.

466
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,340
Xiao Se!

467
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:24,500
(Master,)

468
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,140
is there anything I should take note of

469
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,380
when I go on adventures in the future?

470
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,700
Just remember this.

471
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,740
Speed is of the essence.

472
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,300
(What if speed doesn't help)

473
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:44,900
in contesting against my opponents?

474
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,740
Just remember this then.

475
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:49,180
Run if you can't win.

476
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:50,860
Master,

477
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:51,900
you have great foresight indeed.

478
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,580
However, even if Walking on Clouds

479
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,300
doesn't consume any inner force,

480
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,540
it's extremely exhausting.

481
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,780
I'm in trouble.

482
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,300
(Initially, I wanted)

483
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,220
(to distract some of them)

484
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,460
(so that I could meet up)

485
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,620
(with Lei Wujie after he defeated them.)

486
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,700
(But judging from the situation,)

487
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,020
(I think I can no longer run.)

488
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:10,980
(And Lei Wujie)

489
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:11,860
(can't seem to get rid of them either.)

490
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:34,980
Only I can

491
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,260
go after a scoundrel like Xiao Se.

492
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,500
You guys have no right.

493
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,020
Beware of them.

494
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,460
I know

495
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,140
you cannot defeat these bandits.

496
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,260
But I'm not as weak as you.

497
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:21,460
Are you okay?

498
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,060
That was dangerous,

499
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:23,820
you know?

500
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,100
Aren't you afraid that you'll hit me by accident?

501
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,740
I'm not one of the Tang family.

502
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,180
I have no choice but to try my luck.

503
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,580
Why do you have Lian's weapon

504
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,340
with you?

505
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:31,980
He lost them to me after a drinking game.

506
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,100
Enough.

507
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,420
Let's hurry and find

508
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,060
Lei Wujie.

509
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,620
He might be in danger.

510
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,380
That guy called Su Changli,

511
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,420
I'm afraid I've underestimated him.

512
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,020
Not bad at all.

513
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,820
You've survived long enough under my sword.

514
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,140
You can be proud of yourself.

515
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,460
I'm not done yet.

516
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,460
Although you're no match for me,

517
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,180
you had a chance to escape.

518
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,740
Why do you have to go all out to fight me?

519
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,180
What if you go after my friends

520
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,700
after I leave?

521
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,980
Great. You're a loyal person.

522
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,260
What a great man.

523
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,580
It's worth cutting your head off.

524
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:08,420
Qianluo.

525
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,180
Xiao Se, are you okay?

526
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:11,740
Those assassins

527
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,060
can't do anything to me.

528
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,820
You guys would've been dead

529
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,260
if I hadn't come here in time.

530
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:17,860
Cut the crap.

531
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:32,540
Let's take a break.

532
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,020
Let's take a break.

533
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,500
We almost died

534
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,300
just now.

535
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,100
That's right.

536
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,380
I thought Second Master

537
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:40,900
was guarding over you two?

538
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,540
You have to ask this idiot

539
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:43,820
why he took a huge detour

540
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,620
and went

541
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,060
to Mount Wangcheng.

542
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,140
Qianluo,

543
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,580
how did you find us?

544
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,220
(I can't just tell them
that I've been following them)

545
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,220
(right after they left the city.)

546
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,220
I'll complain about you two

547
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,220
to Second Master.

548
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,380
She'll teach you guys a lesson.

549
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:57,860
Let's go.

550
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,220
Qianluo.

551
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,900
Li Hanyi of Xueyue City.

552
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,900
Su Muyu of Dark River.

553
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,620
Do you remember that we once joined hands

554
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:26,700
to fight against someone

555
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,500
many years ago?

556
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:29,820
I still remember the scene

557
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,540
as if it was yesterday.

558
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,740
But it looks like

559
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,540
you're trying to kill me today.

560
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:38,700
You cannot kill me

561
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,580
by yourself.

562
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:42,700
I'm afraid no one

563
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,380

Xiao Chuhe, the Sixth Prince,

750
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,900
whom he had great expectations of,

751
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:57,820
to his

752
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,660
four good friends.

753
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,540
They are the Four Guardians of Tianqi.

754
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,860
Now, Azure Dragon and Vermilion Bird

755
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,140
have already seen him.

756
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:05,900
It's time for Black Tortoise

757
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:06,620
to make his appearance too.

758
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,060
The Four Guardians of Tianqi?

759
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:10,780
Master,

760
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:12,500
could it be that the person you wanted me

761
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:13,820
to wait for in Xueyue City was...

762
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,220
You want to gather the Four Guardians of Tianqi

763
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,980
and return to Tianqi City
together with Xiao Chuhe?

764
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:22,820
Did General Ye Xiaoying

765
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:23,540
bet everything

766
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,900
on the Sixth Prince?

767
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:27,860
When I saw him as a little girl,

768
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,060
I thought a person like him

769
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:30,740
should inherit the throne.

770
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,460
I don't care who my father chooses.

771
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:33,860
Anyway, I choose him.

772
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,500
It's a pity that you're too late.

773
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,220
I'm too late?

774
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:40,980
Look outside.

775
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:46,500
Master,

776
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,020
what's going on?

777
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:49,820
Xueyue City was always supported

778
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,580
by the Three Great Families.

779
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,660
They're the Tang Clan, Lei family, and Wen family.

780
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,060
The Tang Clan and the Lei family

781
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:57,740
have always been at odds.

782
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,380
We formed an alliance with Xueyue City

783
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,020
out of necessity.

784
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,420
That's also the reason I became friends

785
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,340
with the three city lords.

786
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,180
But now, the situation has changed.

787
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,540
It seems like the old masters of the Tang Clan

788
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,260
have new ideas.

789
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:13,820
New ideas?

790
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:16,700
Now, the Spear Deity

791
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,820
cannot deal with

792
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,020
the old masters of the Tang Clan

793
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,020
alone.

794
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,460
Someone paid them a secret visit.

795
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,580
The offer he gave them

796
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,660
was much higher
than what Xueyue City could offer.

797
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,380
Who is he?

798
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:32,940
It's Xiao Chong, Lord Bai,

799
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:34,700
the Second Prince of Beili.

800
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:38,420
Tang Lian,

801
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:39,620
what techniques

802
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,700
has Baili Dongjun taught you?

803
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,020
Master Baili

804
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,100
taught me a set of neigong techniques
(*internal skill)

805
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:45,500
called Hanging Heaven

806
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,660
and a set of fist techniques called Distant Seas.

807
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,100
He said I could use
the former to strengthen my body

808
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,060
and the latter to defend myself.

809
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,540
Usually, I utilize Tang Clan's

810
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:53,780
branch secret techniques

811
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,180
for most of my fights.

812
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,300
I guess Baili Dongjun

813
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,580
knows that you are a simple person.

814
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,700
That's why he taught you those two techniques.

815
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,020
The essence of the two techniques

816
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,580
lies in their freedom.

817
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,860
But it seems like you didn't grasp the core.

818
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,260
Yes, Master. Please enlighten me.

819
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,660
I chose you out of all the disciples

820
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:17,820
of the Tang Clan

821
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,780
because you're simple.

822
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,780
However, you being simple
will do you harm too.

823
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,700
In life, we have to make sacrifices.

824
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:32,580
This is the Black Tortoise Token.

825
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,420
[Tianqi, protecting the land]

826
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:37,260
Miss Ye,

827
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,300
back then, we promised Lord Langya

828
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:40,740
that our successors would always

829
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:41,900
keep the Sixth Prince safe.

830
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,500
Now, I've imparted the Black Tortoise Token

831
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,140
to my best disciple.

832
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,220
Now, I'll entrust you with the task

833
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,780
of protecting the Sixth Prince

834
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,220
and escorting him to Tianqi City.

835
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,620
Master, I...

836
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,060
You don't need to worry.

837
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:56,860
I hereby impart the Black Tortoise Token to you.

838
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,100
You can choose whether to accept it or not.

839
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:02,100
However, you need to do one thing

840
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,060
for me.

841
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,020
Pear Blossom Needle Cloudburst?

842
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,700
Do you believe that you guys are the ones

843
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:13,180
who will die from it

844
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,500
if you press it?

845
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:15,620
I believe it.

846
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:17,820
It's because you're Tang Lianyue,

847
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:18,500
the best in Tang Clan.

848
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,340
However, you cannot leave here alive.

849
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,220
We

850
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:22,980
will keep you here

851
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,780
even if it means

852
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,780
we and our brothers out there

853
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,900
will die today.

854
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,540
I don't intend to leave.

855
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,460
However, you need to

856
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,020
let these two people go.

857
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,820
Old Master Tang wants to see them.

858
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:38,700
I cannot make the call here.

859
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,460
It depends on them

860
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,340
whether they want to leave or not.

861
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,900
Tang Lian, leave with Miss Ye.

862
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:46,380
Yes, Master.

863
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:47,460
Let's go.

864
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:52,060
[Lianyue Pavilion]

865
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:54,500
Old Master Tang?

866
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,180
Old Master.

867
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:01,900
You're here too?

868
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,540
[Old Master Tang, Tang Clan]

869
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,580
Long time no see.

870
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:05,740
I'm here to check on you.

871
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:07,620
Tang Lian,

872
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,140
I shall speak to Old Master in private.

873
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:11,580
You guys can leave first.

874
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:12,740
Okay.

875
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:13,780
Let's go.

876
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:18,820
Old Master,

877
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:22,100
seems like I've let you down again.

878
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,500
Here are your three bowls of plain noodles.

879
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:29,180
Thank you.

880
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:30,620
Enjoy your meal.

881
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:34,300
We have a long trip ahead.

882
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,140
And we don't have much to spare.

883
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,020
Let's save up as much as we can.

884
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:40,420
You do sound

885
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,820
a little like Xiao Se now.

886
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:47,340
Xiao Se,

887
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:48,500
I think the noodles you make

888
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,700
in Snowfall Villa taste better.

889
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,100
Of course.

890
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:53,780
The cooks I hire are the best

891
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,380
within a 100-li radius.

892
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:56,540
You're bragging again.

893
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:58,580
I'm not.

894
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,060
I ride the best horses,

895
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,180
wear the best apparel,

896
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:02,420
and have

897
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:03,980
the most loyal friends.

898
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,420
Qianluo,

899
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,620
was he referring to us just now?

900
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,260
I think so.

901
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,420
Xiao Se,

902
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,140
I'm so touched!

903
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:20,500
It's my first time

904
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,300
hearing you calling me

905
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,060
as your friend.

906
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,700
If so, what did he call you before this?

907
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,180
Fool.

908
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,180
No, he calls me an airhead.

909
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,220
Am I

910
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,100
that rude?

911
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:40,340
Besides, I'm your friend.

912
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,660
But you owe me money.

913
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,300
These are two different things.

914
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:43,940
If so...

915
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,540
If so, your bowl of noodles costs me 500 taels.

916
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:47,580
And you've eaten it.

917
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:50,180
Fine. 500 taels it is then.

918
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:51,860
It's not like I can't afford it.

919
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:53,740
I'll take it

920
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,260
as repayment for saving me on Mount Wangcheng.

921
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,540
If you had abandoned me back then,

922
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:58,860
I would've been killed

923
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,300
by Su Changli.

924
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,140
If so, you should stop eating.

925
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,340
What are you doing?

926
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:05,700
I saved you

927
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,340
because you're my friend.

928
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,660
Xiao Se, even if you're a penniless fool

929
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:09,820
that entertains people for a living,

930
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,180
I will always save you

931
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:11,900
as long as you're my friend.

932
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,020
But you're viewing our friendship
in terms of silver taels.

933
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:15,260
Forget about 500 taels.

934
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:16,660
I won't take it even if you offer me 50,000 taels.

935
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,700
So, are you saying

936
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,420
that you're willing to risk your life

937
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:22,620
for a friend like me?

938
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:24,660
What will you do for a promise then?

939
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:27,220
For example, you once told me

940
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,060
that you promised your mother
that you would protect a certain person.

941
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:30,940
One of them is concerned with loyalty,

942
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:31,740
while the other is responsibility.

943
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:32,940
What's the difference?

944
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:34,220
Loyalty

945
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,820
is the thing I treasure the most

946
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,740
in my adventure as a martial artist.

947
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:37,860
I can live for it

948
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:38,780
and die for it.

949
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:40,700
That responsibility is something

950
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,340
I have to bear when I was born.

951
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,220
It's a promise that I have to keep.

952
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,140
But what if the person you need to protect

953
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,100
is out to take my life?

954
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,340
What will you do then?

955
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:54,820
If so...

956
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,700
If so, that means my mother

957
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:57,300
is doing the wrong thing.

958
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,460
That means that person is not worth protecting.

959
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,740
I'll escape together with you.

960
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:04,420
If so, what if

961
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,900
the person you need to protect is...

962
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:13,660
Lei,

963
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:15,420
why are you tearing up

964
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,740
at his words?

965
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,260
I'm not tearing up.

966
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:25,260
What's the matter?

967
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,540
It's Drunken Touch.

968
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,020
You do know your thing.

969
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,060
What's going on?

970
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:45,900
Xiao Se,

971
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,100
we're poisoned.

972
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:52,540
Take this.

973
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,300
An expert in Water Coagulation Technique

974
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,700
who can use Drunken Touch at the same time?

975
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,820
You must be a member of Dark River's Mu family.

976
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,700
I'm Mu Ying

977
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:10,700
[Mu Ying, Mu family]
of the Mu family.

978
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:16,940
You guys

979
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,580
are relentless.

980
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,500
I assume you just took

981
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,380
Penglai Pill.

982
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:24,780
That medicine can neutralize

983
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:25,700
my Drunken Touch.

984
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,740
However, they're already poisoned.

985
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,220
It's too late for them

986
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,460
to take the medicine.

987
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:33,340
Shut up!

988
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,140
So, this is the legendary
Stillwater Sword Technique

989
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,340
of Xueyue Sword Deity?

990
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:53,940
I can't use my inner force.

991
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,100
Lei Wujie,

992
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:55,980
Qianluo,

993
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:57,980
don't use your zhenqi recklessly.

994
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,620
Surrender yourselves,

995
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:01,940
and you guys can die

996
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:02,900
without any pain.

997
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,180
Seems like you're getting ahead of yourself.

998
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,020
Don't forget.

999
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,420
I'm not affected by your Drunken Touch.

1000
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,340
You're not a martial artist.

1001
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:15,140
Xiao Se,

1002
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,780
Lei Wujie and I will stall him.

1003
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:17,820
You should run.

1004
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:21,820
Your friends

1005
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:23,780
are going to die

1006
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,940
if they use their zhenqi recklessly.

1007
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:26,820
Shut up.

1008
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:30,660
Mu Ying,

1009
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:32,900
you are pretty smart.

1010
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,980
But you forgot something.

1011
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,140
Although they can't use their inner force for now,

1012
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:40,900
I can.

1013
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:48,180
Xiao Se, what are you doing?

1014
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:49,500
My hidden pulse is damaged.

1015
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,140
So I cannot use my inner force.

1016
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:52,860
This is the Circulation Formation

1017
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,020
I've learned from the nameless book

1018
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:55,700
Scholarly Sword Deity has given to me.

1019
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:57,660
I will lend you guys my inner force.

1020
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:59,420
Why didn't you use it earlier

1021
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,060
when you have such a powerful technique?

1022
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:00,900
In your dreams.

1023
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:02,980
I can only use this

1024
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:03,700
because your inner force is sealed away.

1025
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:05,500
However,

1026
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:06,820
my inner force

1027
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:07,540
will dissipate in a short while.

1028
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:09,620
We need to end this quickly.

1029
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,660
Do you have any news about Xiao Se and his gang?

1030
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,020
I don't.

1031
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:15,820
Didn't the Lei family write to us?

1032
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:16,620
No.

1033
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,100
I heard from Tang

1034
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:18,980
that it took

1035
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:19,860
Lei Wujie and the rest three months

1036
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,100
to reach Xueyue City

1037
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,340
when one month was all they needed.

1038
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:23,860
If that's the case...

1039
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:27,500
I hope that I'm overthinking it.

1040
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,060
It's rare for a person your age

1041
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:38,140
to reach this level.

1042
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,780
Killing a prodigy like you

1043
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:41,900
feels great!

1044
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,540
I'm not afraid of water!

1045
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,140
Fire Infusion, Level Eight,

1046
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:47,620
Heavenly Flame!

1047
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:53,420
Lei Wujie,

1048
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:55,420
don't act recklessly.

1049
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:58,500
