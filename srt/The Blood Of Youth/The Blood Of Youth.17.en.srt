[The Blood of Youth]

24
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,930
[Episode 17]

25
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,450
I once thought

26
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,730
the martial arts world was just as full

27
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,010
of greed as the imperial court.

28
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,500
Until I met you,

29
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:07,090
Wuxin,

30
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,060
Tianwaitian,

31
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,460
Xueyue City,

32
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:11,130
and Dark River.

33
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,220
Now, the martial arts world, to me,

34
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:15,370
is like a mirror.

35
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:17,530
A mirror?

36
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,130
You see yourself

37
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,340
in a mirror.

38
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,500
You see your heart

39
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,620
in the martial arts world.

40
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:27,690
You mean

41
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:29,500
we see what we want to see?

42
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:29,850
Precisely.

43
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,340
Where your heart wants to go
is the martial arts world.

44
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,410
If your heart is full of resentment,

45
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:37,940
then you'll think

46
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,180
that the martial arts world is ruthless.

47
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,570
If you see the good in everything,

48
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:45,900
then you'll become more easygoing

49
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,690
in the martial arts world.

50
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:51,780
Therefore,

51
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:53,850
no matter what happens,

52
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,180
do not forget what you were like

53
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,650
when you first entered the martial arts world.

54
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,060
That is your true self.

55
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,220
Your grandfather said you disliked violence.

56
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,500
That is your most invaluable trait.

57
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,410
But in this martial arts world,

58
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:09,940
we cannot avoid

59
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,530
death.

60
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,250
So follow your heart

61
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,330
to wield your sword

62
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:17,900
in order to protect

63
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,500
what you cherish now.

64
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:22,690
I see.

65
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,060
I'm glad.

66
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,500
Time to go to Lei Fortress.

67
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:29,970
We have wasted enough time.

68
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:42,650
Qianluo.

69
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:43,970
Mingxuan.

70
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:45,620
Sorry for making you worry.

71
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:46,810
No need to apologize to us.

72
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:47,940
Reward

73
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:48,690
your horse.

74
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:49,850
Hedgehog Luo.

75
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:50,740
Are you going

76
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,500
to Lei Fortress too?

77
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,500
Hedgehog? What?

78
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,530
I mean, you look

79
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:55,340
like a human

80
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:56,300
hedgehog.

81
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,970
So you are jealous of me?

82
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:02,620
I won't go with you

83
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:03,180
to Lei Fortress.

84
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:04,690
Master is waiting for me.

85
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:05,570
She'll scold me if I come back late.

86
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,650
All the best

87
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:09,940
in your journey.

88
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:12,060
Take care.

89
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:14,650
Take care.

90
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,450
Rest now.

91
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:34,810
Thank you.

92
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,010
She was born with a birth defect
in the heart meridian.

93
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:41,810
It is a miracle

94
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,540
that she yet breathes.

95
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:44,690
Indeed.

96
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,330
She has received treatment

97
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,450
in Xueyue City for many years.

98
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:48,570
She's Ye Ruoyi,

99
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,060
Lei's

100
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:51,690
love interest.

101
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:56,690
That dummy fell in love?

102
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,500
Bring me to him.

103
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:01,130
So why did you

104
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,180
come back?

105
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:05,500
To visit old friends.

106
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:07,940
The Spear Deity told me to return to Tianwaitian,

107
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:08,570
and I did,

108
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:09,980
but he didn't say

109
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:10,810
I couldn't come back to Beili.

110
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,500
Besides, if I didn't come back,

111
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:14,060
all of you would be dead soon.

112
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,420
What do you mean?

113
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,570
Do you think you're the only one

114
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,300
being hunted now?

115
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,420
I received news

116
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:22,980
that after Xiao Se and Lei Wujie

117
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,130
left Xueyue City,

118
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,060
they didn't head to Lei Fortress right away.

119
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:27,570
They went to Mount Wangcheng instead.

120
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:29,570
After they left the mountain,

121
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,100
they disappeared.

122
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,210
I followed their track

123
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,060
and found this.

124
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:42,250
It said

125
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,130
you were ambushed in the Tang Clan

126
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:45,660
and needed help.

127
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,500
The homing pigeon told me

128
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:48,690
that it was supposed

129
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:49,620
to head to Tianqi City,

130
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:51,010
but it was intercepted

131
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,250
by me.

132
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:54,980
Homing pigeon did?

133
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,450
You can speak with animals?

134
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,500
All creatures have souls.

135
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:02,940
I can even communicate

136
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:03,450
with other plants and creatures.

137
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:04,210
Do you believe me?

138
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:06,420
I didn't dispatch

139
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:08,010
this homing pigeon.

140
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:09,620
Not you, of course.

141
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,010
It told me

142
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,890
that Ye Ruoyi dispatched it.

143
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:17,450
She is no simple woman.

144
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,620
Lei Wujie is going to be in trouble soon.

145
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:22,250
What do you mean?

146
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,010
Because their whereabouts

147
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:24,770
have been leaked.

148
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:26,690
The message from the homing pigeon

149
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:27,940
was intercepted

150
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:29,450
before it reached the General's Residence.

151
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,100
Are Lei Wujie and Xiao Se

152
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,620
that important?

153
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:36,890
I used to think

154
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:38,740
they were only important to me.

155
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,980
How unexpected.

156
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:47,450
Minghou.

157
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:50,540
You're with him?

158
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:52,300
I asked him to come here

159
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:52,890
to pick us up.

160
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:55,300
He has gone insane,

161
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:57,130
but his killer instinct remains.

162
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,130
Don't approach him carelessly.

163
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:02,210
Why

164
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,130
is he doing your bidding?

165
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,130
That's a long story.

166
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,210
This is...

167
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,810
What a strong aura.

168
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,740
Did you see him draw his sword?

169
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,300
He didn't.

170
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:39,660
He used the scabbard

171
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:40,980
to knock Minghou back.

172
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,500
Whenever I return to the martial arts world,

173
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:46,770
I find

174
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:47,860
powerful individuals.

175
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:50,370
How quaint.

176
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:51,940
I just relieved

177
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:53,770
her injury.

178
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,690
If we get into another fight,

179
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,300
even God can't bring her back.

180
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:58,570
Take her away.

181
00:07:58,890 --> 00:07:59,660
I will buy you some time.

182
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:00,740
Can you?

183
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,660
I'm different from who I used to be.

184
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,060
We were apart for a long time.

185
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,420
Even if a Blade or Sword Deity is here,

186
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:10,180
I can hold my ground.

187
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,100
Okay.

188
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:12,370
Be careful.

189
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:18,370
Sir.

190
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:19,740
Your enemy

191
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:21,420
is me.

192
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,810
Astral Travel. Divine Eye.

193
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:26,940
Yes.

194
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,620
They are powerful.

195
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:30,210
And this one too.

196
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:35,330
Mahakasyapa Palm of Ye Dingzhi.

197
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:37,810
I see who you are now.

198
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,100
Likewise.

199
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:42,590
But I can only confirm it

200
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,470
once I see your sword.

201
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:45,990
You

202
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,540
will have to earn it.

203
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,500
Mahakasyapa Palm again.

204
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,470
This is called Arhat Bind.

205
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,140
Arhat Bind?

206
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,500
Even the Buddha

207
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,380
will fail to bind me!

208
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,660
You wish to see my sword, don't you?

209
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:13,230
Take a good look today.

210
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:21,830
Armies Breaking Sword.

211
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,310
It is ranked 5th on the list of famous swords.

212
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,310
The Sword of Dominion.

213
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,430
You are indeed the Wrathful Sword Deity.

214
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:35,950
Old Master.

215
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,260
You came back alone.

216
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:41,110
Where's Tang Lian?

217
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:43,990
The Head of Tianwaitian, Ye Anshi,

218
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:45,380
rescued Tang Lian.

219
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:49,430
Head of Tianwaitian?

220
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,310
He is just

221
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,950
an adolescent.

222
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,860
Compared to your peers,

223
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,070
you are way worse than Lianyue.

224
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:57,740
Noted.

225
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,860
It's fine if Tang Lian is gone.

226
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,020
But that woman

227
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:04,070
is trouble.

228
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,990
General Ye Xiaoying

229
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,380
crossed someone like that.

230
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,540
The Tang Clan

231
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,590
will have a difficult future.

232
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,540
I can only

233
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:14,380
bank on an old friend.

234
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:16,110
An old friend?

235
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:17,830
He

236
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,660
is coming here as we speak.

237
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,310
He should have arrived by now.

238
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:25,070
Wrathful Sword Deity.

239
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:26,710
Pardon my insolence,

240
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:28,350
but if I may ask...

241
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:30,260
We don't know each other.

242
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,260
Why do you wish to see me dead?

243
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:33,710
Because

244
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,230
you are the son of Ye Dingzhi.

245
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,140
My only regret

246
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:39,740
in this world

247
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,860
is that I didn't fight your father.

248
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,470
So you came to bully

249
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:45,190
his son?

250
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,070
That's unbecoming of you.

251
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,230
Therefore,

252
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:53,860
I want to kill you

253
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,380
to vent.

254
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,500
You can't kill me

255
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,140
easily.

256
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,260
How so?

257
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:03,540
Run, Minghou.

258
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:04,900
We can't deal with him.

259
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:09,740
Go!

260
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,470
Unrestrained Shapeless Technique.

261
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,470
This was the technique

262
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,500
Ye Dingzhi used?

263
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,070
Good.

264
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,830
Not good enough.

265
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:30,350
Die!

266
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:34,740
Let's go.

267
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,310
Well done, old man.

268
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:53,590
Mu Yumo.

269
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,020
You're late.

270
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,070
Sometimes I'd like to make you

271
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:58,380
wait for me.

272
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,540
Don't look at me like that.

273
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:04,780
I'm too old

274
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:07,710
for your seduction.

275
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:09,990
You must be joking.

276
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,470
In your young age or old age,

277
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,380
you

278
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,470
have always been a heartless man.

279
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:17,020
Where is your disciple

280
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:17,900
who is as heartless as you?

281
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,430
Why isn't he here?

282
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,110
He is in Lianyue Pavilion.

283
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:24,260
Before he finishes his task,

284
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,260
he will not leave that place.

285
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:29,780
Back to business.

286
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,590
Your guest hasn't arrived.

287
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,780
He's not coming, I suppose.

288
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,780
I know him well.

289
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,780
Either he comes

290
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,500
or he won't at all.

291
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,230
The Wrathful Sword Deity, Yan Zhantian,

292
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,990
will never be late.

293
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:47,780
We need him

294
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,260
to do this,

295
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,540
but it's not impossible.

296
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:54,110
And I thought

297
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,710
I could meet the famous Wrathful Sword Deity.

298
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,740
In the end,

299
00:12:58,950 --> 00:12:59,780
it was just a small chat

300
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:00,740
with you.

301
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,140
How boring.

302
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:11,990
Array of Thousand Arachnids.

303
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,430
And what is in your sleeve?

304
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:24,830
Perfect.

305
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,350
The ultimate secret poison of the Tang Clan

306
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,110
and the ultimate secret array of Dark River.

307
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,020
Victory will be ours.

308
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:35,470
Do not underestimate

309
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,740
our foes.

310
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:53,780
Who may our esteemed guest be?

311
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,590
It's the Leader of Dark River.

312
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:58,990
I am the Second Prince of Beili,

313
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:01,110
Lord Bai, Xiao Chong.

314
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,110
I have been waiting

315
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,260
to see you.

316
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:08,830
You were waiting for me?

317
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:09,830
Indeed.

318
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,230
Your younger brother

319
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:14,830
impersonated someone

320
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:18,070
and used this syndicate.

321
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:20,540
Dark River never looks

322
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:23,470
at one's status when we kill,

323
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,740
no matter how prominent he is.

324
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,020
Therefore,

325
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,260
he has to die.

326
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:35,780
Please show mercy.

327
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,950
If I hadn't shown any mercy,

328
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,710
he would have been dead

329
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,860
when he met me.

330
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:52,710
The Ninth Prince

331
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,710
wanted Dark River to work with the Tang Clan

332
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,540
to eliminate the Lei Clan.

333
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:01,190
The Lei Clan is a key ally

334
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,260
of Xueyue City.

335
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,430
Eliminating the Lei Clan

336
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:06,380
is akin

337
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,430
to breaking one of Xueyue City's arms.

338
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:10,070
This

339
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,380
is a good deal

340
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:13,900
for my syndicate.

341
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:15,500
However,

342
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:17,190
eliminating the Lei Clan

343
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,070
is just the prologue.

344
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,780
You came to me

345
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,500
and that's

346
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,990
when the real thing unfolds.

347
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:27,950
What?

348
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:29,350
Yes.

349
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,380
I said I was waiting for you

350
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:32,660
because

351
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,070
among the princes in Tianqi City,

352
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:38,190
I had my eyes on you at the very beginning.

353
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:42,780
I will help you ascend to higher status

354
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,190
while you will help Dark River

355
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:46,740
flood

356
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:49,380
the entire martial arts world.

357
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:52,620
Chong!

358
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:59,660
Do you know your mistake now?

359
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:02,540
Chong.

360
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,590
I've made a mistake.

361
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,780
Apologize to the Leader now.

362
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:15,590
No need.

363
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,380
You already knew who I am?

364
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,540
Young man.

365
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:23,190
You underestimated Dark River.

366
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,310
We already knew it

367
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:28,380
the moment

368
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,380
you stepped in here.

369
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,020
We spare you

370
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,350
because...

371
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:36,350
Lord Bai, Xiao Chong.

372
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:39,350
You are our best bet.

373
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,430
Leader.

374
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,470
If I may be frank,

375
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:45,020
Dark River

376
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:47,620
isn't my first choice.

377
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:53,660
Shouldn't you be afraid

378
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:55,780
that I would kill you both here

379
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:56,780
if you turned me down?

380
00:16:58,950 --> 00:16:59,860
I don't think

381
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,660
you're that unwise

382
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,110
as to sabotage yourself.

383
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,190
But choices

384
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,580
have to be made now.

385
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,630
Lord Bai.

386
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:12,870
A hasty decision

[Zhiyuan City]

389
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,020
I have been having plain buns for days

390
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:29,390
and I'm losing weight.

391
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:31,430
Be grateful that you can still fill your tummy.

392
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:33,470
Why didn't you ask your grandfather

393
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,100
for money

394
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:35,950
when you left Sword Heart Tomb?

395
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:37,580
The swords they sell there

396
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,820
are worth a fortune.

397
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:41,300
Your grandfather

398
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,740
is also among the top three wealthiest men
in the martial arts world.

this poor?

401
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:46,230
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

402
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,540
Why?

403

(What is the bounty about?)

406
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:53,670
I'll have a look.

407
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:55,870

and will pay 1,000 silver taels for it!

413
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,230
It's 1,000 silver taels!

414
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,390
Can we heal?

415
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:11,710
That money

416
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:12,780
has nothing to do with us.

417
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,340
We don't need to know how to heal.

418
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,250
Don't you have that Penglai Pill

419
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,470
or Three-Day Pill?

420
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:20,670
Hush.

will come after me

425
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,500
if they know about the Three-Day Pill?

426
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,950
I know the Penglai Pill is precious.

427
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,300
But in this small town,

428
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,670

00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,460
They have principles

and faith.

461
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,990
They don't want

462
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:37,540
to be sullied.

463
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,390
They were born for it

464
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,820
and can also die for it.

465
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:47,150
Xiao Chuhe is like that.

466
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,140
That's why he ended up

467
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,140
where he is now.

468
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,510
I respect people like that,

469
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:55,340
but I can't become someone like them.

470
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,060
He is pure.

471
00:19:59,190 --> 00:19:59,860

473
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:03,620
And my color

474
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,510
can only be white.

475
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,030
I also have lines that can't be crossed.

476
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:11,670
I

477
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:13,780

A missive from Shao Han.

479
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,100
His Majesty has been asking

480
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,190
why we haven't come back.

481
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,430
Anything unusual

482
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,270
from other princes?

483
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:31,380
Nothing.

484
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:32,910
Other than Lord Chi, Xiao Yu.

485
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,540
He claims to be sick

486
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,380
and hasn't come out for more than a month.

487
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:38,780
That decadent lord...

488
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:40,030
Jingxia.

489
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:42,910
Do not underestimate Lord Chi.

490
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,430
Although only you and he were given

491
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,230
lordship,

492
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:48,470
you earned it

493
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,540
with your latent.

494
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:51,270
What did Xiao Yu do?

495
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,580
He has it because his mother

496
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,470
is Father's favorite.

497
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,100
You can't judge

498
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,140
a book by its cover.

499
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:01,990
Lord Chi, Xiao Yu,

500
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:04,910
is a formidable enemy.

501
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,340
Also, you made

502
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:08,020
a mistake.

503
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:11,860
We weren't the only ones given lordship.

504
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,860
You're referring to Lord Yong'an, Xiao Chuhe?

505
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,540
Dark River has already said

506
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,140
that they wouldn't stop

507
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,100
hunting him.

508
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,140
Honestly,

509
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,750
you should just help them...

510
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:30,780
Silence!

511
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,430
Did you forget

512
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:34,300
what I just told you?

513
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,060
Did you get in touch with Master?

514
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:40,780
My people are looking for him

515
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:41,820
as we speak.

516
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,340
But the Wrathful Sword Deity

517
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:45,380
is hard to track down.

518
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:46,910
I just know

519
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,340
that he left when he almost arrived
at the Tang Clan.

520
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,750
I hope we can contact him

521
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:50,580
in time.

522
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:53,100
Only he

523
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,030
can stop everything.

524
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,860
Yes, physician?

525
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,190
Her meridian system is beyond repair.

526
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:07,380
Prepare for her funeral.

527
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:08,780
Farewell.

528
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:09,540
Physician!

529
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:13,990
God will bless us.

530
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:15,820
She will be fine.

531
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:16,820
She will be.

532
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:17,860
I only believe in physicians now.

533
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,060
Right.

534
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,140
It seems like

535
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,270
only the Medicine King, Xin Baicao,

536
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,140
can save her.

537
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:23,030
I'll go to him now.

538
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:23,860
Sir.

539
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:26,670
Someone gave us this

540
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:28,230
and said she would be cured after consuming it.

541
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:35,380
Penglai Pill?

542
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:36,380
Peng?

543
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:38,430
What is a Penglai Pill?

544
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:40,270
A sacred pill
from the Hall of Medicine in Tianqi City.

545
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:41,620
Only the royal family

546
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,540
can use it.

547
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:43,910
How many of them?

548
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:45,580
Two men and one woman.

549
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:46,990
The woman carries a spear.

550
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:48,030
As for the two men,

551
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:49,510
one is dressed in red and another in green.

552
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:52,270
It's them!

553
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,300
Xiao Se! Qianluo!

554
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:58,990
Lei Wujie!

555
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,270
Lian.

556
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:02,230
Lian.

557
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:03,710
Lian.

558
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:04,300
I...

559
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:06,060
It's only a few days

560
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:07,710
and you miss me that much already.

561
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:08,910
You have no idea.

562
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,190
Without you,

563
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,060
we were bullied

564
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:11,820
wherever we went.

565
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,030
So you only know how nice I am

566
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,620
when you were bullied.

567
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:17,300
Of course, not!

568
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,780
If you're here,

569
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,750
is Miss Ye here too?

570
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,510
Is the patient

571
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:28,470
Ruoyi?

572
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:30,710
Ruoyi.

573
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:33,100
The Penglai Pill will unblock

574
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:34,580
your meridian system.

575
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:36,540
I know it'll hurt a lot,

576
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:37,780
but I know

577
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,430
you can survive it.

578
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:40,820
Hang in there.

579
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:48,860
I haven't been able

580
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:49,780
to say this to you.

581
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:51,580
Long time no see.

582
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,230
Rest now.

583
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:09,100
So?

584
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:09,470
Xiao Se.

585
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:12,820
How is Ruoyi?

586
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,100
She is fine now.

587
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,510
You are friends with Ye?

588
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,230
You seem to know her condition

589
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:22,140
very well.

590
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:23,540
If I didn't mishear,

591
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:24,750
she said

592
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,860
"long time no see" just now?

593
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,910
We met when we were young.

594
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,670
So you two know each other, but why didn't you

595
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:33,860
say hi to her last time?

596
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,230
Unless...

597
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:37,430
Unless you two used to be together.

598
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:40,910
What?

599
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,750
We're just old acquaintances.

600
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:45,230
How dare you.

601
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:49,030
How dare you.

602
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:49,860
All right.

603
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:51,710
Come with me.

604
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:53,140
I need to speak with you.

605
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:57,860
What did I do?

606
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:00,990
So the Tang Clan

607
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:02,510
plans to betray Xueyue City?

608
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:06,670
I don't know

609
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:07,540
what my old master is plotting now,

610
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:08,750
but it's clear

611
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:09,820
that he doesn't want

612
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:10,780
to side

613
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:11,540
with Xueyue City anymore.

614
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:13,190
And he must have

615
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,030
a better offer.

616
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:15,580
Lian,

617
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:17,380
this is serious.

618
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,060
You should return to Xueyue City

619
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,140
to inform the Third City Lord.

620
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:22,060
I can't.

621
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,060
Is it because you haven't made up your mind?

622
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:25,140
No.

623
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:27,910
The Tang Clan is my family,

624
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:30,100
but Xueyue City is my sect.

625
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:32,860
I don't want to betray either of them.

626
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:34,380
I just want to stop this

627
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,510
from happening.

628
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:37,230
I can't go back to Xueyue City

629
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:38,430
because I have another

630
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:39,430
important task at hand.

631
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:40,950
And what is that?

632
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:44,510
Lei Fortress will soon hold

633
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,100
a hero banquet.

634
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:46,540
But now,

635
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:47,750
they don't know the changes

636
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:48,300
within the Tang Clan.

637
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:50,030
The banquet

638
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,510
might be the start

639
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:52,430
of Tang Clan's defection.

640
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,580
I already wrote to Xueyue City,

641
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:55,860
but it might be too late.

642
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,060
So

643
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:58,860
I have to head to the Tang Clan

644
00:25:59,340 --> 00:25:59,910
to stop this.

645
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,780
But this will be challenging.

646
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:02,430
Indeed.

647
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,910
I can't do this

648
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:04,470
alone.

649
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,060
But if I do my best,

650
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:07,300
I won't regret it.

651
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,340
Don't worry, Lian.

652
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,380
We're here.

653
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:13,430
As for Ruoyi,

654
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,090
I checked her heart meridian just now.

655
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:18,620
She could survive until now

656
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,100
because there's zhenqi in her body

657
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:21,430
and it

658
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:22,860
is very familiar.

659
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:24,510
It's from Wuxin.

660
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,190
Wuxin?

661
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:27,780
Where is he?

662
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,270
He didn't come with you?

663
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:31,710
We ran into

664
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:32,710
a strange swordsman.

665
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,510
He wore a black cape

666
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:36,990
and carried

667
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:38,580
an enormous sword.

668
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,270
Wuxin kept him busy

669
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:42,190
as I took Miss Ye with me

670
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,060
and left.

671
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:45,710
Could it be him?

672
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:48,780
(Yan Zhantian)

673
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,510
(and the Tang Clan are on the move now.)

674
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,140
(Could mastermind)

675
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:52,990
(be Chong?)

676
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,510
(But Chong won't collude)

677
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,580
(with Dark River at all.)

678
00:26:58,470 --> 00:26:59,100
(Could it be...)

679
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:01,340
Xiao Se, you know him?

680
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:03,990
Wrathful Sword Deity.

681
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,670
The Wrathful Sword Deity, Yan Zhantian?

682
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,780
He ranked 3rd on the Top-Rank List.

683
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,540
He shares it with my sister!

684
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:13,670
But Wuxin

685
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,060
can't possibly fend off him.

686
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,030
I did observe carefully.

687
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,950
Wuxin is way stronger

688
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:19,670
than before.

689
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:21,510
If I'm not mistaken,

690
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:22,990
he should be

691
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:24,620
in the Insouciant Phase now.

692
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,030
Even if he can't defeat Wrathful Sword Deity,

693
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,670
he can still flee.

694
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:29,060
Why?

695
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,230
You think Wuxin

696
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:31,580
doesn't stand a chance in front of him?

697
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:32,510
No.

698
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:34,990
It reminds me

699
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:36,030
of another Sword Deity.

700
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:36,780
Lei Wujie.

701
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:39,100
Why hasn't the Xueyue Sword Deity

702
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:39,860
contacted you?

703
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:42,140
Right!

704
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,540
The three strongest individuals
of the Tang Clan.

705
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:51,710
Tang Yin, Tang Lie, Tang Yue.

706
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:53,670
You are here

707
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,430
to kill me, too?

708
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,380
The Tang Clan is working with Dark River.

709
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:00,270
What a rare sight.

710
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:02,510
I bet

711
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:04,030
this is Su Changhe's doing.

712
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:06,710
When I first met him,

713
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:07,620
I knew

714
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,030
he would be devoured

715
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:12,140
by his own ambition one day.

716
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,100
Li Hanyi.

717
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:16,860
That is very arrogant of you.

718
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:18,470
Arrogant?

719
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:22,190
It's just two head figures of Dark River

720
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:24,190
and the three strongest fighters
of the Tang Clan.

721
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,190
I can get rid of all of you.

722
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:27,060
Muyu.

723
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,060
They say Beili is the land of swords

724
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,750
and Nanjue is the land of blades.

725
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:34,910
It's time to show them

726
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,300
how foolish they are.

727
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:49,820
Iron Glacier, as majestic as always.

728
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:39,470
I am called Xie Qidao

729
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:41,910
because one will die after I swing my blade

730
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:42,990
seven times.

731
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:45,230
And I have done it six times.

732
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,340
If you won't die in my next attack,

733
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:49,910
I'll have to change my name.

734
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:53,270
No need.

735
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:55,140
Because today,

736
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,030
you'll die.

737
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,910
Li Hanyi, Xueyue Sword Deity.

738
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,470
Don't get ahead of yourself now.

739
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,510
I have yet to perform the final slash.

740
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:05,780
It's named

741
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:07,430
Deicide.

742
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:15,470
Why did he stop all of a sudden?

743
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,190
This is a unique technique for those

744
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:18,430
who study fist and blade techniques.

745
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:19,580
It's called Mustering.

746
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,910
He is now channeling all his strength

747
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:23,580
before he does the final slash.

748
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:25,580
Su Muyu.

749
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,710
You couldn't stop me last time.

750
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:29,270
And it will

751
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,140
be the same today.

752
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:33,230
It's different today

753
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:35,100
because I'm not alone.

754
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:36,860
If you truly wish

755
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:38,100
to force

756
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,380
Xueyue City's hand,

757
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:41,910
then please

758
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:43,710
accept your demise.

759
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:57,140
Qingxiao.

760
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:01,100
Pardon my disobedience here.

761
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,190
I have to leave today.

762
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:15,510
Martial Uncle Yin.

763
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:17,540
They say

764
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,820
I'm the world's greatest diviner.

765
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:20,540
But I think

766
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:21,820
the title should be yours.

767
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,580
Why else are you here to stop me

768
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:24,430
whenever

769
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:25,950
I want to leave?

770
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:30,230
Do I need to divine to know

771
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,190
if you want to leave or not?

772
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:39,910
Mount Wangcheng

773
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:41,820
is such a blissful place.

774
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,380
Even the animals are smart.

775
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,190
They know I'm about to leave.

776
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:49,470
Martial Uncle,

777
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:53,510
I wish to leave the mountain.

778
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:56,030
It's getting boring here.

779
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:57,860
Yuzhen.

780
00:31:58,860 --> 00:31:59,820
Are you going to let us down

781
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:01,060
after what your master

782
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,950
and Mount Wangcheng did to you?

783
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:06,340
It can't be helped.

784
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,620
I left Qingxiao Sword behind.

785
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:11,620
Please

786
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:12,910
take over my position too.

787
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:14,820
Once Feixuan grows up,

788
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:16,510
he can inherit my position.

789
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,100
Peach Blossom.

790
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:25,100
Peach Blossom.

791
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:27,540
Let's go to find her,

792
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:28,540
all right?

793
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,950
For the sake of my dead martial brother,

794
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,910
I cannot allow you to leave.

795
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:36,780
Martial Uncle.

796
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,030
You can't stop me.

797
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:42,190
I do not seek the heaven's will,

798
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,620
yet the heaven's will came knocking at my door.

799
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:45,100
I only wish to drink liquor

800
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:45,990
in the peach blossom forest.

801
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:47,860
Martial Uncle Yin and my master,

802
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:48,950
forgive me.

803
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:52,060
Master!

804
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:56,670
Grand Martial Uncle, don't leave.

805
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:58,230
Why?

806
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,300
Martial Uncle Yin can't even stop me.

807
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:01,860
Why are you here?

808
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:04,340
Do you want a spanking?

809
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:07,300
Feixuan.

810
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:08,540
Your Supreme Dragon Elephant Skill

811
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,380
is nearly mature.

812
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:11,990
To master it,

813
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:13,670
you need to see the world.

814
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:15,430
After three months,

815
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:16,510
you will venture out of the mountain.

816
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,540
Do not come back within three years.

817
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:20,030
Fansong.

818
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:21,860
You will accompany Feixuan.

819
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:23,820
You are fated to have two masters.

820
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:25,430
One is me

821
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,060
and our fate has run its course.

822
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:28,580
And another

823
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,190
is in the martial arts world.

824
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:31,980
He is as good a swordsman

825
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:33,230
as me.

826
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:35,510
No.

827
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,670
I don't need two masters.

828
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,190
I just need

829
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:39,580
you.

830
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:43,100
Foolish child.

831
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:44,780
I am merely leaving the mountain,

832
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:46,340
not walking to my own death.

833
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:47,950
No need to shed tears.

834
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:49,820
But Grand Martial Uncle,

835
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:51,540
what you said

836
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,470
sounds like your final speech.

837
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:59,780
I just think that I'll be gone

838
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:01,580
for a long while.

839
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,710
Don't worry. I won't die.

840
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,510
I'm Zhao Yuzhen,

841
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:08,990
the one who almost reaches Godhood.

842
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:10,620
I fear no

843
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:11,990
heavenly tribulations.

844
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:13,910
I will leave

845
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,220
and come back with a wife.

846
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:21,910
Master!

847
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:23,830
I look forward

848
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:25,310
to our reunion!

849
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,060
He is the Tao Sword Deity.

850
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,950
So what if there's a heavenly tribulation?

851
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:31,310
He can dispel it in one second!

852
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:49,950
That was a beautiful

853
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:51,220
slash.

854
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,580
As expected from a Sword Deity.

855
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:57,180
But too bad.

856
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:59,220
Don't you notice

857
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,260
that your power

858
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:02,100
has been dampened?

859
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:04,060
This Phase-Suppressing Array

860
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:05,910
is specifically set up for you.

861
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,310
Su Changhe...

862
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,470
And we laced the entire bamboo forest

863
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,220
with colorless and odorless poison

864
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,060
from the Tang Clan.

865
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:17,260
Once inhaled,

866
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,350
it will eat away your inner force.

867
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:23,220
Just like before,

868
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:25,660
you resort to dirty tricks like this.

869
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:29,310
Indeed.

870
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,180
Otherwise,

871
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:32,540
how can I

872
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:34,660
keep the Xueyue Sword Deity here

873
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,870
forever?

874
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,220
You think

875
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:40,140
my inner force has all but depleted.

876
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,180
But I still have the strength
to perform one more slash.

877
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,060
And after this slash,

878
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:45,620
I will die

879
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:48,390
and so will you.

880
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:50,950

916

They always say

917
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,430
among the Five Sword Deities,

918
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:17,030
the Lone Sword Deity is the strongest,

919
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:18,060
because he

920
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:19,660
can occupy one city alone.

are the strongest.

931
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:40,620
Delusional.

932
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:42,100
Buddha says

933
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:45,100
that all those have a form are delusions.

934
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:49,510
And what do the Taoists believe in?

935
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:50,740
All those have a form,

936
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,100
except for my Little Fairy,

937
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:55,510
are delusions.

938
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:57,180
I say that.

939
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:58,950

00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:21,220
How can he summon

945
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:21,830
these many weapons?

946
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:23,790
They are swords conjured

947
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:24,580
from the qi of sword.

948
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:25,430
But they are as lethal...

949
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,030
Advance.

950
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:27,350

please find us an opening.

961
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:14,950
Little Fairy.

962
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,220
It's too late.

963
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,030
Pear Blossom Needle Cloudburst

964
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,510
contains 27 needles in total.

965
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:41,740
The Tang Clan got hit by three.

966
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:44,140
I intercepted 23.

967
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:45,540
And the last one...

968
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:51,060
Little Fairy...

969
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:53,510
Li Hanyi was hit.

970
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:54,620
Kill them.

971
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,140
Zhao Yuzhen forced himself

972
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:13,100
to reach the Unbeatable Phase
before performing that slash.

973
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,220
I'm sure it will backfire on him.

974
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:17,180
Let's give chase.

975
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:18,790
Leader.

976
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:23,950
Long time no see.

977
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:25,220
How interesting.

978
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:27,700
The Tao Sword Deity left his mountain

979
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:31,140
and a veteran left Tianqi City.

980
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:35,100
Please come with me.

981
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:37,260
If that is the wish of the State Preceptor,

982
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:38,830
I shall comply.

983
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:40,100
Let's go.

984
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:56,830
