This time,

27
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,240
I'm really leaving.

28
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:08,830
What's the hurry?

29
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,320
Why don't you stay for a few more days?

30
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,870
Everything is set in Tianqi City.

31

has been executed as well.

I have nothing else to do here,

38
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,240

Are you returning to Tianwaitian immediately?

40
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,800
I will first send Mother to Muliang City.

Why the silence?

49
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:14,870
I was thinking.

50
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:17,120
How can you manage

to become

52
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,710
the head of the extraterritorial clan?

53
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,350
Is this how you behave

54
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,230
in front of them?

55
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:26,880
You can't imagine

56
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,200
how I act as the head of the clan.

57
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,960
I, too, cannot imagine

58
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,680
how you'd look as the Emperor.

59
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:37,520
But to be honest,

60
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,150
you are only one step away

61
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,000
from the throne.

62
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,000
I'd like to ask you.

63
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,590
Did you really think it through?

64
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:50,390
Honestly,

65
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,320
I've thought about it a lot.

finally comes,

close the door

00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,830
Sounds logical.

100
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:15,960
One

101
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,910
is to live

102
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,120
for at least

103
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,030

However,

I will never leave my bed

The other

109
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:34,880
would be that I

110
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,230
can

111
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,760

This is the choice that I made.

122
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,000
I forced Hua Jin into it.

I used to drink

is very ambitious.

He allowed you to come to Tianqi,

144
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:02,590
it definitely isn't only

145
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:03,510
for the sake of studying medicine.

146
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,830
What does he want?

147
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,280
I'm afraid

148
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,320
one ship wouldn't be enough.

149
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,320
Would it be enough to let your friend

150
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,040
become the Emperor?

Back then,

154
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:38,280
my father asked me the same thing.

155
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,710
I told him this.

00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:49,230
not by men.

159
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,920
There is no meaning to your will.

160
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,400
It only depends

161
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,400
on whether you are ready

162
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:57,830
to be responsible for the world.

163
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,440
I didn't become the Emperor

164
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:02,590
as I was chosen by God.

165
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,920
I came with a blade

166
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:07,830

But you.

You are truly the chosen one.

169
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,960
I heard that even the Tianzhan Sword

176
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,280

184
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:01,870
I will tear it up.

185

Then, the world will fall into chaos.

186

You don't want chaos,

00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,630
After this, give it
to the Directorate of Astronomy.

195
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:56,680
Yes, Your Majesty.

196
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,510
You may all leave.

197
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,040
Chuhe.

198
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:05,400
Stay for a while.

199
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,160
When you were little,

200
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:51,830
you were never

201
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,350
afraid of the cold.

202
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,560
Do you remember?

203
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,560
Once, there was heavy snow

204
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,110
in Tianqi City.

205
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:06,510
It was hard to even walk.

206
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:09,110
But you

207
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,560
wanted to ride in the snow.

208
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,440
So you went out with your horse

209
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,560
and went around Tianqi City.

210
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,230
In the end,

211
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,160
you got lost.

212
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,320
You were only brought back

213
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,440
by Marquis Lanyue when it turned dark.

214
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,800
When I went to see you,

215
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:34,870
your hands

216
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,830
and ears

217
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,680
were frostbitten.

218
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:41,350
But you

219
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:43,960
continued to talk excitedly

220
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,800
about how you'd repeat it the next day.

221
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:51,870
I remember.

222
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,040
In the end, I fell sick the next day.

223
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,830
I almost died from that too.

224
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,230
I also remember

225
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,230
that you were by my side

226
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,990
the whole time.

227
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,200
I was afraid.

228
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:11,750
Because of that,

229
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:14,680
I blamed myself.

230
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:16,990
Why did I choose to read memorials

231
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,800
instead of going with you?

232
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,710
Otherwise,

233
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,990
you wouldn't have got lost

234
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,470
or got frostbitten.

235
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,830
At that time,

236
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,870
in between moments of consciousness,

237
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,560
I saw you with me

238
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,280
and I felt very safe.

239
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:41,110
Really?

240
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:42,350
Yes.

241
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,230
Because to me,

242
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:48,800
you are the only wise man.

243
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,710
All these years,

244
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,320
I learned the art of war

245
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:54,630
and practiced martial arts,

246
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,200
all in the hope that one day,

247
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,320
I can protect you with the weapon

248
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,470
I hold.

249
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:10,320
Chuhe.

250
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:13,590
Now,

251
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:16,470
you are in your twenties.

252
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,750
Your brothers

253
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,830
are all married.

254
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,160
What about you?

255
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,750
How is it going with Ye Ruoyi,
the daughter of General Ye?

256
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,470
She's always been close to you
since she was little.

257
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,630
As for Ye Xiaoying,

258
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,830
he has retired,

259
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,040
but

260
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,830
he still holds a military title.

261
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:42,710
I...

262
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,040
I have someone I like.

263
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,160
Whose daughter is she?

264
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,510
Spear Deity, Sikong Changfeng's daughter,

265
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:55,830
Sikong Qianluo.

266
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,710
The Vermilion Bird?

267
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,710
The Vermilion Bird

268
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:05,510
is an interesting man.

269
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,040
His wife is beautiful.

270
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,560
I'm sure his daughter

271
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,280
is beautiful too.

272
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:15,830
That's nice.

273
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,830
But people from the world of martial arts

274
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,590
long for freedom.

275
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,440
They can't stay in one place for long.

276
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:25,590
Just like Consort Xuan.

277
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,200
Has Consort Xuan left?

278
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:32,680
She has.

279
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,200
Let her leave then.

280
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,320
And that friend of yours, Lei.

281
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,280
How is he?

282
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:49,630
He's fine.

283
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,230
He sustained some minor injuries.

284
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:53,710
Does he not want to work for the government?

285
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,110
No.

286
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,800
He just wants to be a hero

287
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,630
and be invincible.

288
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,230
He's smarter than his father.

289
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,070
Father.

290
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,270
You seem to be in good humor, Father.

291
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:12,640
Chuhe.

292
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:15,030
Say.

293
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,400
If I had done everything I could

294
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,400
to let Ruofeng live,

295
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:26,680
how would things

296
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,510
have turned out now?

297
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,440
Father.

298
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,680
There are crossroads in life.

299
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:42,600
Once we've made the choice

300
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,750
to go down one path,

301
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,680
we'll be doomed

302
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,840
to not see the scenery of the other.

303
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:52,270
Whether it's heaven or hell,

304
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,120
we will never know.

305
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,600
I'm tired.

306
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,470
It's time for me to rest.

307
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,230
Leave.

308
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:14,250
Yes, Father.

309
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:15,180
Go.

310
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,010
Brother.

311
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:53,380
Ruofeng.

312
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:07,050
Father?

313
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:12,420
Father!

314
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,810
(In the winter of the 23rd year
of Emperor Mingde's reign,)

315
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:05,330
(Emperor Mingde passed away in his sleep)

316
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:08,290
(at 57 years old.)

317
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:09,980
(The same day,)

318
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,290
(the Langya Army on the border
has been defeated.)

319
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,500
(Retreating past 19 cities.)

320
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:19,610
Xiao Se.

321
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,770
A large group of upper and lower armies

322
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:22,740
has arrived just outside Tianqi City.

323
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,420
Miss Ye has left to welcome them.

324
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,530
You hold the power as the Director of Nation

325
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:27,370
and are reinforcing the borders.

326
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:28,610
They wouldn't dare disobey you.

327
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:31,900
So what if they defy me?

328
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:33,940
They can't watch Beili become subjugated.

329
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:35,900
They are ambitious,

330
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,130
but they're not dumb.

331
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:38,610
You shouldn't leave.

332
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,810
A kingdom cannot be without its Emperor.

333
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,420
You should be enthroned immediately.

334
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:43,740
As for the battlefield,

335
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:45,660
Uncle and I can go.

336
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:47,980
I should be enthroned?

337
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:49,810
You are the chosen one.

338
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:51,810
That sword can only be used

339
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,770
by the founding Emperor.

340
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,370
It chose you.

341
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,660
Since you're saying

342
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,500
that I'm the chosen one,

343
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:01,740
then I should be the one

344
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,940
to guard Beili as well.

345
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:06,090
Well said, Xiao.

346
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,530
That should be the way.

347
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:09,500
Mu and Divine Healer,

348
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,500
you should be leaving Tianqi soon, right?

349
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,500
We will depart tomorrow.

350
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,500
Thank you for all this time.

351
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,020
Xiao Se.

352
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,810
Are you really not bringing us along?

353
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,660
Killing enemies on the battlefield
and roaming the martial arts world

354
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:26,810
are very different.

355
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,130
Wait here for me.

356
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,460
I will definitely return in triumph.

357
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:31,530
Qianluo.

358
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:32,980
Xiao Se has been nagging us

359
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:33,850
all night long.

360
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:35,370
Just do as he says this time.

361
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:37,530
Lei Wujie.

362
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,460
You once asked me

363
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,810
if our encounter at Snowfall Villa

364
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:43,220
was a coincidence

365
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:44,770
or arranged.

366
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,700
I can answer you now.

367
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:49,900
Our encounter

368
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,570
was a coincidence.

369
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:51,980
But meeting each other

370
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,220
is inevitable.

371
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,620
[Tianqi City]

372
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,170
[Lord Bai's Residence]

373
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:09,020
How come you have the time

374
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,130
to visit me today, Director?

375
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,460
For the past few days,

376
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:15,330
have you been waiting for me, Your Highness?

377
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:17,370
That's right.

378
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:19,420
I've been waiting for you.

379
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:21,850
Right now, Xiao Se is gone

380
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,700
and the other Dragon Seal Scroll

381
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,530
is in my possession.

382
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:32,410
Director.

383
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:34,850
You didn't open the scroll?

384
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:37,900
The late Emperor Mingde said

385
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:39,700
that this is just an extra copy.

386
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:40,810
It should not be opened.

387
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,020
However,

388
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:45,090
I've seen the one that Xiao Se possesses.

389
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:47,700
I already know

390
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,260
who will be ascending the throne.

391
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,180
Who is it?

392
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,770
Of course it's you, Your Highness.

393
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,280
You aren't lying to me, right?

394
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,180
Everyone is confident

395
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,780
that my father would have written down

396
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,540
Chuhe's name.

397
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:10,300
Yet,

398
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,940
I saw it with my own eyes.

399
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,050
Your name is written in the scroll.

400
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,940
Now, I possess the scroll,

401
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,530
and you are the only prince

402
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,050
within Tianqi City now.

403
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:23,770
If you are enthroned now,

404
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:24,980
it's justifiable.

405
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:26,740
Even if Xiao Se

406
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:28,220
returns after winning the battle,

407
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,420
he has to acknowledge

408
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,020
that everything is justifiable.

409
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,090
Otherwise, it would be treason.

410
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:35,660
However...

411
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,770
If you wait for Xiao Se's return,

412
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,220
when he holds the military power

413
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,770
and military exploits,

414
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:44,660
he can totally

415
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:45,940
destroy the two scrolls

416
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,700
and be the Emperor himself.

417
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,660
You should understand

418
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,810
what I mean by all of that.

419
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:54,460
Director Jinxuan.

420
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,530
Are you trying to form an alliance with me?

421
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:59,130
But I remember

422
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,180
that you worked for Lord Chi.

423
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:04,420
I worked for His Majesty.

424
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:06,530
I was assigned

425
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,940
to assist Lord Chi

426
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:09,330
just so I could find out

427
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,570
who his partisans are

428
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:14,900
and have them removed for His Majesty's sake.

429
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:17,740
But why does it seem

430
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,370
that ever since Father had been seriously ill,

431
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,660
you had been

432
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:25,180
helping Lord Chi in becoming the Emperor?

433
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:26,900
You have the death-exemption plate

434
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,980
and worked for my father,

435
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:30,850
yet you were part of a faction fighting for power.

436
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,900
If that isn't the case, then you're doing

437
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:36,330
way too much

438
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,700
as someone who is just monitoring.

439
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:38,770
Your Highness.

440
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:42,370
We are both at a dead end.

441
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,850
If Xiao Se returns after winning the battle,

442
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:47,050
we will have no other way out.

443
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,220
With his prestige,

444
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,700
he can ascend the throne of his own will,

445
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,500
disregarding

446
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,770
this Dragon Seal Scroll.

447
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:56,940
By then,

448
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,570
you would have no chance, Your Highness.

449
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,180
You're wrong.

450
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,740
If Xiao Se fails,

451
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,050
only then will we have no way out.

452
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,040
Our nation will be doomed.

453
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:17,770
If we die,

454
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,940
what other way out is there?

455
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:21,290
Director.

456
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:27,330
Seems like you do not intend

457
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,130
to work with me, Your Highness.

458
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,330
But what I said was true.

459
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:33,770
I've been waiting for you.

460
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:37,460
What do you mean?

461
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,570
Before my father passed,

462
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,940
he summoned me

463
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:42,740
and told me

464
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,260
that if Jinxuan sought me,

465
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:46,570
I should kill him.

466
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:50,810
Jinxuan.

467
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,260
It's time for everything to end.

468
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,750
[Three months later]

469
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,020
Xiao Se!

470
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,090
Xiao Se is back.

471
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:20,370
So cool.

472
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:30,180
Why didn't he put on his armor

473
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:31,660
even when at war?

474
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:38,610
Qianluo.

475
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:39,940
You have no idea.

476
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,260
It's cooler to conquer the battlefield

477
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:44,180
in a suit gown.

478
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:51,800
[Tianqi City]

479
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:52,850
Let's hurry

480
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,050
to the Snowfall Villa to wait for him.

481
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:55,530
No rush.

482
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,610
Xiao Se returned in triumph.

483
00:27:57,770 --> 00:27:58,610
He must first go to the palace.

484
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:00,810
All the officials are waiting for him.

485
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,050
Uncle.

486
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,460
Back when Uncle Langya

487
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,660
returned,

488
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:11,370
was it as grand as this?

489
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:15,460
More or less.

490
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,500
Today is the day he returns.

491
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:20,530
It should also be the day

492
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:21,370
the new Emperor ascends the throne.

493
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:55,260
-Welcome back,
-Welcome back,

494
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:57,090
-Lord Yong'an.
-Lord Yong'an.

495
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,740
Keep kneeling for now.

496
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,530
There are more important things

497
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:01,940
to be announced later anyway.

498
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,050
If you get up now,

499
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,740
you have to kneel again.

500
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:18,660
Uncle.

501
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:21,940
Why do so many people

502
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,290
yearn for this seat?

503
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:26,530
I've not sat on it before,

504
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:28,420
so I don't know.

505
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:30,770
Let me try it.

506
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,090
(When that day)

507
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,090
(finally comes,)

508
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:47,530
(sit on that seat.)

509
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:49,370
(The thought that comes to you then)

510
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:53,570
(will be your true thoughts.)

511
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:01,500
Boring.

512
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:09,420
Uncle.

513
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:12,090
I know the officials are all waiting for this.

514
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,460
It's best

515
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:14,850
if you read it out.

516
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:27,050
Read it.

517
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:41,500
"I have been suffering from illness

518
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:45,810
and may pass on in a short time.

519
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,810
My second son, Xiao Chong,

520
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:49,740
is of good character,

521
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,500
competence, and virtue,

522
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:55,420
hence able to inherit my will

523
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:56,900
to build up Beili

524
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:59,420
and ascend the throne.

525
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:03,530
I pass the throne to the Second Prince,

526
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,020
Xiao Chong."

527
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:07,810
This...

528
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:11,050
Why

529
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:13,090
is it not Lord Yong'an?

530
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:16,770
He wouldn't start a mutiny, would he?

531
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:17,810
How dare you!

532
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:22,100
Marquis Lanyue has read the decree.

533
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,430
Why are you officials

534
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:28,060
not kowtowing

535
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,230
to the new Emperor?

536
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:43,710
All hail the new Emperor!

537
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:54,540
-All hail the new Emperor!
-All hail the new Emperor!

538
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,260
All hail

539
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,100
the new Emperor.

540
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:28,150
You may all rise.

541
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:30,390
-Thank you, Your Majesty.
-Thank you, Your Majesty.

542
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:40,340
Chong.

543
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:43,950
I will leave

544
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:46,430
the nation to you.

545
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:53,300
Take care.

546
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:58,020
I'm leaving, Uncle.

547
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:20,430
Is there really

548
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:21,710
such an inimitable man in this world?

549
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:23,340
There are plenty of them

550
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:25,340
in the martial arts world.

551
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,470
You government servants

552
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:29,780
haven't seen much of the world.

553
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:42,340
Xiao Se.

554
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:43,630
You're finally back.

555
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,500
Let's pack up and leave.

556
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,340
You're all so quick.

557
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:49,150
Can't I even get a cup of tea?

558
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:50,870
Qianluo was even ready

559
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:52,150
to wait for you outside the palace.

560
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:54,150
Young Master.

561
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:55,910
Young Master.

562
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:56,670
This...

563
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,470
Are you really leaving?

564
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:00,710
Don't worry, Mr. Xu.

565
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:02,910
I won't be gone for that long.

566
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:05,580
Don't live at Snowfall Villa anymore.

567
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:06,910
Stay at my residence.

568
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:08,620
I will come back from time to time.

569
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:09,870
Take good care of it.

570
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:12,060
Yes, Young Master.

571
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:14,790
Your Highness, you actually

572
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:15,910
remembered the promise.

573
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:21,470
I still don't like it

574
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,430
when people call me Your Highness.

575
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,180
Just call me Young Master.

576
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,750
Then, I shall gladly accept

577
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,180
the Snowfall Villa then.

578
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:29,220
Just take it.

579
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:31,660
Xiao Se.

580
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:33,750
Are you really gifting Snowfall Villa

581
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:34,790
to Second Master Tu?

582
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:35,870
I thought

583
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:37,020
it was the one in the mountains.

584
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:40,140
You have another

585
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:40,910
Snowfall Villa?

586
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:41,660
Yeah.

587
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:43,790
I initially planned

588
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,750
to give that one to you.

589
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,140
But now, I suddenly can't bear to.

590
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:48,980
I feel that the other one

591
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:50,420
is better than this.

592
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,020
If so,

593
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:54,380
I should continue to do business

594
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,060
with you, Young Master.

595
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:57,660
That way, I can take over
that Snowfall Villa as well.

596
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,060
You will have to give us a good offer.

597
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:01,100
Of course.

598
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,100
Mr. Xie Xuan,

599
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:04,940
you helped us multiple times.

600
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,220
We haven't been able to thank you yet.

601
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:09,060
You're welcome.

602
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:10,830
We scholars

603
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,380
are always talking about justice.

604
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,430
How can we be bystanders

605
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,790
in times of trouble?

606
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:18,910
Xiao Se.

607
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,540
I expected you to return

608
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:21,700
and be the Emperor.

609
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:22,980
Fansong,

610
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,310
you want me to be the Emperor?

611
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,420
Regardless, Feixuan

612
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:27,580
is the future State Preceptor.

613
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,300
Since you're not the Emperor,

614
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:30,860
he may feel a little lonely.

615
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,220
Isn't that so, Feixuan?

616
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,310
I wish to return to Mount Wangcheng too.

617
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,100
I don't want to stay here.

618
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,140
In the end, you made

619
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,580
the same decision as Lord Langya.

620
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:39,820
The same?

621
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:42,740
I don't think so.

622
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:44,940
I'm not as strong-willed

623
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:45,820
as Uncle Langya.

624
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:47,870
But I am also more carefree than he was.

625
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:49,910
I am clear

626
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:51,870
that I do not belong

627
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:53,350
to the Imperial Court.

628
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:54,700
Why?

629
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,420
It's too small.

630
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:00,570
Everyone.

631
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:04,690
Wrathful Sword Deity?

632
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:10,580
Don't worry.

633
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,660
I'm not here to stop you.

634
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,140
Chong'er

635
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:15,660
asked me to pass this

636
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:17,420
to you.

637
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,550
[I pass the throne to the Sixth Prince, Xiao Chuhe.]

638
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,500
Father is so sly.

639
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:47,460
Everyone.

640
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:50,090
Farewell.

641
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:52,210
Farewell.

642
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:52,650
Farewell.

643
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:56,940
