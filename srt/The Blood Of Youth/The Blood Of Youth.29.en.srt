[The Blood of Youth]

24
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,940
[Episode 29]

25
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,790
I wasn't sure if I should agree.

26
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,870
I asked Marquis Lanyue,

27
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,430
and he asked me to get your opinion.

28
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,350
Who does he want you to treat?

29
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,430
According to him, it's a blind patient.

30
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,630
When he was young,

31
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:04,920
he ate a snack he got from someone.

32
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,960
He lost his sight after that.

33
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,040
It's been 20 years.

34
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,550
I'm not sure if it can be cured.

35
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:11,480
Are you able to cure it?

36
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,350
If he hasn't gone blind for long,

37
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,230
I could remove the toxin with acupuncture.

38
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,600
But he's been blind for 20 years.

39
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,720
Maybe he'll need to get a new pair of eyes.

40
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:20,510
Wait.

41
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,320
Divine Healer, are you kidding?

42
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,790
A new pair of eyes?

43
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,670
Just one word, yes or no.

44
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,350
You're the healer.

45
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:32,110
Saving lives

46
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,390
is your duty.

47
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,760
Besides, this guy is very rich.

48
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,480
He can afford the medical fee for sure.

49
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,070
So yes, you can treat him.

50
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:40,200
Xiao Se.

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,510
But remember to say

52
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,480
that it was I who asked you to treat him.

53
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,110
You're good-looking.

54
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,480
But you're not very smart.

55
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,760
You came to Snowfall Villa at night.

56
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,510
Yet, you wore an all-white outfit.

57
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,510
Vermilion Bird?

58
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,480
You, Dark River, like

59
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,440
to give yourselves code names

60
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,350
and call others' code names?

61
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:02,670
I'm White Tiger.

62
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,110
White Tiger?

63
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,920
This name doesn't sound...

64
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,440
Wait.

65
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,510
You're White Tiger?

66
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,440
What are you two doing?

67
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:16,480
Qianluo,

68
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:17,230
stop.

69
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,480
Why didn't you ask her to stop first?

70
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,630
Well, Ji Xue, stop.

71
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,390
Are you giving me an order?

72
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,040
Both of you are very childish.

73
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:28,790
You're either surrounded

74
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,830
by a silly kid like Lei Wujie

75
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,830
or an impulsive young lady like this.

76
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:32,620
Xiao Chuhe,

77
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,720
is there

78
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,200
no other ordinary guardian around you?

79
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,880
You could've come in through the front gate.

80
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,390
Why must you sneak in here?

81
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:41,550
You can't blame anyone for this.

82
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,350
Come in through the front gate?

83
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,920
Do you know how many people

84
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:46,830
in Tianqi City

85
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,200
are having their eyes on this gate?

86
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:49,920
As long as the misunderstanding is cleared up.

87
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:50,720
You must be

88
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,070
the daughter of Baixiao Sect's head,

89
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:52,880
Ji Ruofeng.

90
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,630
Finally, there's someone smart here.

91
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,670
Since you have a guest,

92
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:00,040
we should leave first.

93
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,440
Her presence resembles that

94
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,110
of an elegant soaring swan.

95
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,550
Gracefully, she moves like a dragon in flight.

96
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,760
Prettier than the autumn chrysanthemum.

97
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,480
More vigorous than the pine in spring.

98
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,070
Mysterious

99
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:11,670
as the moon covered by clouds.

100
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,280
Extraordinary

101
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,720
as snow whirled by the driving wind.

102
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,310
What are you murmuring?

103
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:22,990
Miss,

104
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,870
I'm the apprentice of Divine Healer Hua Jin,

105
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:25,870
Mu Chunfeng.

106
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,550
It's a pleasure to meet you.

107
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,480
I know.

108
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,870
I didn't know I was so famous.

109
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,310
But I don't know who you are.

110
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,310
Ji Xue.

111
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,550
I'm 21 years old.

112
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:40,840
How old are you?

113
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:41,520
Are you married?

114
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:41,870
I'm still single.

115
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,430
See you around.

116
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,400
You should've inquired

117
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,640
about her beforehand.

118
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:56,870
Qianluo.

119
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,920
Are those two close to each other?

120
00:04:59,400 --> 00:04:59,990
It feels

121
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,550
like she has an affinity

122
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:03,550
for Xiao Se when she talks to him.

123
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,790
They've known each other since childhood.

124
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,960
Ji Xue's father

125
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,480
is Xiao Se's master.

126
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,040
He is the closest person to Xiao Se in this world.

127
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,160
He's even closer to him than His Majesty is.

128
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,990
That's why it's different.

129
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,230
But he does

130
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,040
act differently around you.

131
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,280
Does he?

132
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,430
Chunfeng, we should get going.

133
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,230
Master,

134
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,280
let's stay a little longer.

135
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,600
Mr. Mu,

136
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,960
is this Miss Ji Xue

137
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,870
really that pretty?

138
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,640
Among the women in the world,

139
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:45,790
I've never seen

140
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,600
someone refined like her.

141
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,190
Her smile stands out

142
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,520
among other ladies

143
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,160
as if they're nothing.

144
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:57,990
Nothing?

145
00:05:59,110 --> 00:05:59,640
Nothing.

146
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,430
Let's go.

147
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,280
Master,

148
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,430
let's stay a little longer.

149
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:05,960
Just go.

150
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,160
How's the investigation going?

151
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,310
I've found the person

152
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,350
you asked me to look for.

153
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:13,080
Where is he?

154
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,750
He's hiding in plain sight.

155
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,580
[Ye Anshi is here
in the guest room of Tianqi City's inn.]

156
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,580
[Hongfu Inn]

157
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,060
Long time no see,

158
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:38,900
Mr. Xiao.

159
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,220
You already knew that I'd come.

160
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,340
Baixiao Sect has been looking for me everywhere.

161
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,820
I can see that they're exhausted.

162
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,660
So I developed compassion

163
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,860
and deliberately went downstairs
to buy a vegetable bun.

164
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,300
This inn

165
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,060
is a long street away

166
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,100
from my Snowfall Villa.

167
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,340
Since you knew I sent someone for you,

168
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,660
why didn't you come over sooner?

169
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,220
I'd like to try your royal banquet

170
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,780
that contained 15 appetizers.

171
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,220
I'd also like

172
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,700
to see how commanding and majestic

173
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,100
you were at Qianjin Gambling House.

174
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,380
Unfortunately,

175
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,780
you hadn't entered the city

176
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,140
before I went on the retreat.

177
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,780
You had already left

178
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,100
when I finished the retreat.

179
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:24,740
Retreat?

180
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,500
Were you injured?

181
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:28,740
Yes.

182
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,020
I nearly became a cripple.

183
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:33,980
Who did that to you?

184
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,900
Director Jinxuan.

185
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:42,300
What's wrong?

186
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,660
Every time when you're in danger,

187
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,180
I'll be there and save you.

188
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,060
But when I was in danger,

189
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,220
you didn't show up.

190
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,180
So you feel guilty

191
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,980
and want to avenge me?

192
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,180
You were injured by Jinxuan

193
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,980
because you entered the palace.

194
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,860
So I was right.

195
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,780
You came to Tianqi

196
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,740
for Consort Xuan.

197
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,180
You've changed, Mr. Xiao.

198
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,260
You've become straightforward.

199
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,220
You knew

200
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,780
that I didn't want to talk about this.

201
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,980
You should've pretended not to know it.

202
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,380
You shouldn't have underestimated

203
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,700
those skilled fighters in the palace,

204
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,700
especially the Five Eunuchs.

205
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,780
None of them is easy to deal with.

206
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,540
And there are many Imperial Swordsmen.

207
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,940
Even I have never met them before.

208
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:33,620
I understand.

209
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,380
I'll be careful next time.

210
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,780
Next time?

211
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:43,860
Wuxin,

212
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,740
as you're eager to see Consort Xuan,

213
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,660
are you trying to ask her questions

214
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,340
or get her out of there?

215
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,500
Will she leave with me?

216
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,780
She lives an extravagant life in the palace.

217
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,660
Unlike Tianwaitian,

218
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,340
it's actually an infertile land.

219
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:17,900
Your Highness,

220
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:18,820
it's getting late.

221
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:19,900
It's time to get rest.

222
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,220
Your Highness.

223
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,020
Why did Yu suddenly

224
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,420
mention Shi'er today?

225
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,220
Did he have news from Shi'er?

226
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,300
Maybe it was

227
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,620
just an innocent question.

228
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,180
Don't mind it, Your Highness.

229
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:44,740
Right.

230
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,420
It's been years.

231
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,620
Maybe Shi'er

232
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:50,580
has already

233
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,340
forgotten about me, his unfit mother.

234
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,860
What right do I have

235
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,980
to see him again?

236
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,500
Actually, Consort Xuan

237
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,700
is not what you thought she was.

238
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,180
She's an outcast in the palace.

239
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,940
She never attends any party,

240
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,660
and she doesn't interact

241
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,900
with the people in the palace.

242
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,740
I remember when I was a kid,

243
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,300
I once barged

244
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,060
into her courtyard.

245
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,860
She gave me a piece of pastry

246
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:19,980
and enjoyed

247
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,540
the sky view with me all afternoon.

248
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,380
All afternoon?

249
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,940
She said it'd be nice if she could become

250
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:27,700
a bird.

251
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,980
So that she could fly,

252
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,740
fly over the walls,

253
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,820
fly over the mountains,

254
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:37,900
and even fly

255
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,580
to the farthest South.

256
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:42,900
South?

257
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,460
I didn't understand it when I was little.

258
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:46,900
I left after staying there

259
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:47,660
all afternoon.

260
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,780
Until Uncle Langya told me

261
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,380
about her story.

262
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,260
It made me wonder

263
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:57,580
if the place

264
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,220
Consort Xuan wanted to go

265
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,380
was

266
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,580
the hut outside Gusu City.

267
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,140
After all, she and Ye Dingzhi

268
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,140
have stayed there for a long time.

269
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:10,980
Also,

270
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,620
it was where they gave birth to you.

271
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:19,620
You're saying

272
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,140
that she actually has no choice?

273
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,500
I'm saying

274
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,220
that this is your hardship.

275
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,220
You must take good care of yourself.

276
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,460
Everything I said is what I saw.

277
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:37,700
Forget it.

278
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,260
Actually, I also don't know

279
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,940
why I want to see her.

280
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,020
Maybe I'm just wondering

281
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,220
how she's doing now.

282
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,700
I'd like to ask her

283
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:51,300
if she

284
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,420
remembers that I'm her son.

285
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:54,700
Or maybe

286
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,860
I just want to see her one last time

287
00:11:59,020 --> 00:11:59,820
before I go back.

288
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:02,860
Then, she can stay in Beili

289
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,500
as Consort Xuan.

290
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,420
I'll return to Tianwaitian

291
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,820
and be the Young Head.

292
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,780
I can't believe there's something you don't know.

293
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,180
Everyone has their own worries.

294
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:19,660
If you just

295
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,060
want to see Consort Xuan,

296
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,140
maybe I can help you.

297
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,980
Or else, no one in Tianqi City

298
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,700
can help you.

299
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:36,700
As expected,

300
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,460
you care for me.

301
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:41,740
I just want you

302
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,220
to solve your problems sooner.

303
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,260
And don't get me in trouble.

304
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,900
You speak with forked tongue.

305
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:54,860
These

306
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,580
are the fragrances I collected from everywhere.

307
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,420
Feel free to take them if you like.

308
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,900
Sixth Prince, why are you being so generous?

309
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,820
I'm flustered.

310
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,700
Just get to the point.

311
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:10,620
Okay.

312
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,140
Eunuch,

313
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,260
whose side are you on in the current

314
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:16,780
Tianqi City?

315
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,100
Must I pick a side?

316
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,700
In this war,

317
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,300
only the winning side

318
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,940
can survive.

319
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:28,900
It's impossible

320
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,420
to stay neutral in this matter.

321
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,140
Your Highness, you must be well aware

322
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,620
that no matter whose side we're on,

323
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,700
if His Majesty dies,

324
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,100
the Five Eunuchs
will have to guard the mausoleum.

325
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,220
Are you willing to do it?

326
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,180
To me, it doesn't make any difference.

327
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,300
Even now,

328
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,660
all I do

329
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:57,180
is just chant, pray, and blend fragrances.

330
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,940
The Blizzard Sword, Shen Jingzhou, I know

331
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,260
is not like this.

332
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,620
He used to yearn for the martial arts world.

333
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,020
Though I can't go around the world,

334
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,660
it's more liberal than staying in Tianqi City.

335
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,300
Eunuch Jade Deity,

336
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,140
I won't beat around the bush.

337
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,660
I can assure you

338
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,860
that you can go anywhere you like

339
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,740
after leaving Tianqi City.

340
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,500
In the name of Lord Yong'an?

341
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:33,460
It's in the name of Xiao Se.

342
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,380
As long as you believe

343
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,100
that I can do it.

344
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:39,780
Why me?

345
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,500
When you entered the martial arts world,

346
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,660
you claimed yourself as Blizzard Sword.

347
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,940
Your integrity showed when you swung your sword.

348
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,940
I believe in my judgment.

349
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,340
Please have faith in me

350
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,620
and give me a helping hand.

351
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,740
Every time I walk in here,

352
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,020
this is the sound

353
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,620
I hate to hear the most.

354
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,100
This means that you're conscious

355
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,700
and with my footsteps,

356
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,020
you can figure out who I am.

357
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,180
You really are a strong woman.

358
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,460
Just like your pretty face.

359
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,340
I couldn't forget about it

360
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,700
ever since the first time I met you.

361
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,740
I won't let you have your way.

362
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,700
Do you know

363
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,820
how I convinced Minghou

364
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,060
to be the drug tester?

365
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,780
I told him

366
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,380
if he resisted,

367
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,780
you'd forever be locked in here.

368
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,380
With the stinky smell of blood,

369
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,340
the bodies of rats,

370
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,620
and the insects' bites,

371
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,180
your body will slowly rot.

372
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:03,660
You vile man!

373
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:06,660
No.

374
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:07,980
You've misunderstood me.

375
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,780
I was just helping him.

376
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,740
Minghou won't listen to you.

377
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:13,980
You're wrong.

378
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,620
He said yes

379
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:16,300
without any hesitation.

380
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,140
But he got a low adaptive capacity.

381
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,740
We were only halfway there.

382
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,100
Unlike you,

383
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,540
you're way better than him.

384
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:33,740
Yueji,

385
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,620
you were born to be a killer.

386
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,300
But a killer

387
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,980
can't have a heart!

388
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,780
I've found

389
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,340
a perfect weapon.

390
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:49,940
Soon,

391
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,420
he'll become just like you.

392
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:55,820
Yueji,

393
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,300
there's not much time left

394
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,140
for you.

396
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,060
Wait.

397
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,060
Why are all of you entering the palace?

398
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,020
Eunuch Jade Deity

399
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,700
wants to hold a Fragrance Ceremony
for His Majesty.

400
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,540
These eunuchs

401
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,980
will burn incense for each palace.

402
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,580
An assassin sneaked
into the palace several days ago.

403
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,700
Those who enter the palace

404
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:30,940
must undergo body searches.

405
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:31,780
How dare you!

406

407
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:35,900
Eunuch.

408
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,060
This is His Majesty's decree.

409
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,300
Just let them check it.

410
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,180
-Thank you, Eunuch.
-Yes.

411
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:01,340
Wait.

412
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:05,060
Director.

413
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,380
Why are you here so early today?

414
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,300
Old people

415
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,140
need less sleep.

416
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,780
Sometimes, I can't sleep.

417
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,020
So I get up and walk around.

418
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,140
So that His Majesty can sleep peacefully.

419
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:23,620
Are they

420
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:24,740
your new apprentices?

421
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:26,740
Yes.

422
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:37,740
They don't look familiar.

423
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:40,860
They just entered

424
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,140
Hongqing Temple this year.

425
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,780
I think they're young

426
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,540
but smart

427
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:47,620
and agile.

428
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,540
They won't neglect their masters of each palace.

429
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,740
Is there any problem, Director?

430
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:57,940
With you in charge,

431
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,340
I'm at ease.

432
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,060
Go on.

433
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:07,620
Let's go.

434
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,380
Go to the palace you're assigned to.

435
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,780
Remember to be careful.

436
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,570
No mistake is allowed.

437
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:33,780
-Noted.
-Noted.

Consort Xuan's Jingtai Palace

439
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:39,980
is at the northwest corner.

Thank you, Eunuch Jade Deity.

441

The palace gate will be closed at the hour of Xu.
(*Between 7 PM and 9 PM)

Leave before that.

443
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:48,540
Understood.

451
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,260
I understand.

00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,900
You're so naggy, it's annoying.

453
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,140
I don't know if I'm helping him

454
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:12,740
or getting him killed.

to see our father.

that I'm confused?

the courtyard.

511
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,860
Was it because of the fallen leaves?

512
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,540
It was me who asked them not to clean it.

513
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,180
Leaf litter is a natural phenomenon.

514
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,020
It's unnecessary to dispose of them.

515
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:13,700
But why do you

516
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,620
make this payer hall

00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,940

us together.

529
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,580
You said your name is Wuxin.

530
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,740
Who gave you that name?

531
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,500
My master did.

533
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,020
one is clear-minded, selfless,

534
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,540
and won't go astray

535
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,620
without a heart.

536
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,820
One will be free without a heart.

537
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,660
I guess you've got a good master.

539
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,140
is the best master in the world.

545
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,220
Why are you here so early?

546
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,660
I made you upset

547
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:52,940
that day.

548
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,380
I felt sorry when I went back.

549
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,660
After greeting Father today,

550
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,060
I rushed over to see you.

551
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,300
I know you don't like Eight Treasures Tea.

552
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,140
I asked someone to bring new tea leaves over

553
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:04,940
from the outside.

554
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,740
You can try it.

555
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,780
See if it fits your taste.

556
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:10,820
-I...
-Go brew it.

557
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,180
Who is he?

558
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,060
He's a eunuch from Hongqing Temple.

559
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,780
He's here to burn incense for your father.

560
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,580
He came here early in the morning.

561
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,180
The figure of this eunuch

562
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,300
looks familiar.

563
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,020
You've seen many people.

564
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:54,060
Maybe they just look alike.

565
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,140
You're right.

566
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,020
Go clean up the prayer hall.

567
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:07,700
Yes.

568
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,420
Please, Mother.

569
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,900
The color looks nice.

570
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:19,700
I guess it'll taste good.

571
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:37,580
It's nice.

572
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:44,580
Does Lord Chi always come

573
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,460
to visit Consort Xuan?

574
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,340
He only came here often the past two days.

575
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,740
Sometimes, he didn't show up for two weeks.

576
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,660
Has Consort Xuan

577
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:54,780
always

578
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:55,900
been alone like this?

579
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,220
She wasn't alone at first.

580
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,380
Back then, His Majesty always came to visit her.

581
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,300
She was frequently rewarded.

582
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,540
Then, something happened.

583
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,220
And His Majesty never came again.

584
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,620
She got no further reward.

585
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:09,860
Over time,

586
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,540
others have stopped coming too.

587
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:13,660
Consort Xuan doesn't like

588
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,940
to make trouble for others.

589
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:15,980
As they didn't come,

590
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:17,180
she refused to go out.

591
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,260
I haven't seen her talking

592
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,020
so much

593
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,380
with someone else for years.

594
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:23,660
Father

595
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,660
has been troubled by a matter lately.

596
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,500
Do you want to know what it is?

597
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,460
I'm not interested in something

598
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,660
that doesn't concern me.

599
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,980
What if it is

600
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,500
about your other son?

601
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,380
Why do you mention him again?

602
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:46,700
Don't do anything rash.

603
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,420
I didn't say anything.

604
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,700
Why did you scold me?

605
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,580
I just want to remind you

606
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,980
that you can play any trick you like

607
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,740
to get what you want.

608
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:03,060
But there's someone that you can't lay a hand on.

609
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,140
Play any trick I like?

610
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:13,860
Mother,

611
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,090
if it wasn't

612
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:17,700
for the trouble you made out there,

613
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,980
why would I have to play tricks?

614
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:21,780
You used to be

615
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,740
Father's favorite consort.

616
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:24,740
I was

617
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,380
Father's favorite son.

618
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,260
I could've gotten everything I want.

619
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,660
If it wasn't for you and Ye Dingzhi,

620
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,260
I wouldn't have ended up like this.

621
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,020
Over the years,

622
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,500
I've been ridiculed,

623
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,980
left out, and mocked.

624
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,060
What about you?

625
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,540
You lived in isolation.

626
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,180
What would you know?

627
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,660
But judging from your look,

628
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,340
it seems like you're still deeply in love

629
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,340
with Ye Dingzhi.

630
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,220
Even his son

631
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,100
is more important than me.

632
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,580
Well, I'll wait and see

633
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,620
what will happen to you two.

634
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:33,260
Your Highness, do you want

635
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,380
to go back and get some rest?

636
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,140
You must've heard

637
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,540
about my story outside the palace.

638
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,380
It's all an urban legend.

639
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,380
I won't take it seriously.

640
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:53,500
Take a seat.

641
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:56,340
Thank you, Your Highness.

642
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,100
Tell me about it.

643
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:04,700
Your Highness

644
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,140
was married

645
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,940
to His Majesty

646
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,780
when he was still Lord Jingyu.

647
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,660
Then, you were set up

648
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:16,330
and abducted by Ye Dingzhi,

649
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,540
the Head of Demon Sect.

650
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,300
In the end, Demon Sect lost

651
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,220
and you successfully escaped.

652
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,900
Then you got rescued

653
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,620
and returned to the palace.

654
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,540
Pretty much what I'd expect.

655
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,940
It has protected his reputation as the Emperor.

656
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,260
Isn't this

657
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,020
the fact?

658
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,500
Are you curious?

659
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,740
If you knew it,

660
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:45,060
it might get you killed.

661
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,980
Everything I heard here at Jingtai Palace

662
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:50,820
will stay

663
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,140
here for sure.

664
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:01,860
In fact,

665
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:04,820
the rumor out there

666
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,380
is mostly true.

667
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,700
Except for one thing.

668
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,500
I left with Ye Dingzhi

669
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,820
of my own free will.

670
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,540
We only parted

671
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:17,740
as we were set up by the bad guys.

672
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,340
They lied to me

673
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,900
that Yu'er was severely ill.

674
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,860
They got me back to Tianqi City

675
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,780
and made Ye Dingzhi think

676
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,500
that I abandoned him

677
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,940
for an extravagant life.

678
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:33,700
Before he died,

679
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,260
I finally got to see him.

680
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,300
I told him

681
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,220
that we should escape to Nanjue

682
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,700
and get away from the disputes.

683
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,780
He said he did a lot of wrong things.

684
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,060
He couldn't leave just like that.

685
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,940
Only his death

686
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,540
can protect his peers.

687
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:53,620
In the end,

688
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,020
he committed suicide.

689
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:01,500
So,

690
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:02,940
what you wanted

691
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:03,980
to say to him in the end

692
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:05,860
was to leave with him?

693
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,220
But it was too late.

694
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,140
The wrong step I took

695
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,620
was the reason

696
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,620
that everything happened.

697
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,700
Then, why did you return

698
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:22,620
to the palace?

699
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,660
I've got two kids.

700
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:29,860
One of them was trapped in the palace.

701
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,500
I couldn't leave him behind.

702
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:39,180
So you gave up on the other one.

703
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:41,900
Xiao Ruojin wouldn't make

704
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:45,580
things difficult for my other son

705
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:48,460
only if I returned to the palace.

706
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,700
The imperial family always attaches

707
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:51,980
great importance to their reputation.

708
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,140
If I was back,

709
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,620
he'd keep his promise.

710
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,940
Now, that son of mine

711
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:04,140
has gone to the coldest land.

712
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:09,060
But I'll soon leave

713
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:10,820
this place.

714
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:22,580
Unknowingly,

715
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,300
I've told you a lot of things.

716
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:25,540
Maybe

717
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:27,540
it's because you look a lot

718
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:28,780
like him.

719
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:32,180
Ye Dingzhi, the Head of Demon Sect?

720
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,140
His eyes looked

721
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,860
as pretty as yours.

722
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:39,380
I suppose

723
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,460
my kid is about your age.

724
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,420
What

725
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,420
is your kid's name?

726
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:52,060
His name is Ye Anshi.

727
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:55,860
It's a good name.

728
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,700
I think those few years

729
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,180
were the happiest time

730
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,300
in my life.

731
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,220
It was also the first time

732
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,900
I found the world likable.

733
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:09,820
That's why

734
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:12,100
I gave him this name.

735
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,060
I see.

736
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,540
Tell me about you.

737
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:19,940
What about you?

738
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:21,900
Wuxin,

739
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,260
tell me about your experiences.

740
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:27,900
About me?

741
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:29,940
Yes.

742
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,020
Where are you from?

743
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,740
Where did you grow up?

744
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,940
How did you

745
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,780
come to Tianqi City?

746
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:41,460
I lived in chaos before I met

747
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:43,980
my master.

748
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,540
But I was happy.

749
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:48,540
In my memory,

750
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,540
there were my mother, father,

751
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:52,860
and

752
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,380
many uncles who loved me.

753
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,260
But then they passed away.

754
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,740
I was lucky to meet my master.

755
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,580
We lived together

756
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,420
and relied on one another.

757
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,780
Then, my master's gone too.

758
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:15,540
After that, I've been through ups and downs.

759
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,100
Eventually, I came to Tianqi City.

760
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:22,220
I didn't expect you to experience so much

761
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,420
at such a young age.

762
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:31,860
Your Highness, are you sleepy?

763
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,540
Don't call me that.

764
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,980
I don't like being called that.

765
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:42,820
Wuxin,

766
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,660
you may leave first.

767
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,900
Chat with me some other time.

768
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:52,060
But there's not much time left.

769
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,900
I'll leave here soon.

770
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:03,700
Consort Xuan?

771
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,140
Consort Xuan?

772
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:08,500
Mother?

773
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,820
Xiao Yu, this jerk!

774
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,540
[Jingxue Pavilion]

775
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:42,420
What are you thinking?

776
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,660
Wuxin should be in the palace now.

777
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:46,820
Wuxin?

778
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,100
You've found him?

779
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:51,460
He has entered the palace once before.

780
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,460
But he was injured by Jinxuan.

781
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,740
He's been recuperating lately.

782
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,700
I went to Jade Deity a few days ago.

783
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,700
I asked him to get Wuxin into the palace.

784
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,420
He wanted to see his mother?

785
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,460
But this is too risky.

786
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,820
The Wuxin I know

787
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,260
is the smartest guy I've ever met.

788
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,780
He won't do something silly.

789
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,620
Everyone will do something silly.

790
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,100
It's when they encounter the person

791
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,100
and the matter they care about the most.

792
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,420
Keep an ear out for the news from the palace.

793
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:25,460
Sure.

794
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:33,380
Xiao Yu,

795
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,860
why would you poison your own mother?

796
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,060
So what?

797
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,300
Anyway,

798
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,060
the poison won't kill her.

799
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,060
Besides,

800
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:44,420
you're here to remove the toxin from her body.

801
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,460
She'll be all right.

802
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:49,100
This is the Toxin-Reversing Technique
of Medicine Valley.

803
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,180
When you mobilized qi to remove the toxin,

804
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,380
the toxin

805
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,260
has already been transferred

806
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,220
to your body.

807
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:13,980
Then,

808
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,010
why did you do this?

809
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,860
It's all because of you,

810
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,100
my dear brother.

811
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:21,940
You're a martial arts expert,

812
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,260
and you're smart.

813
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:26,060
What kind of situation

814
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,380
can make you let your guard down?

815
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:38,940
It's a great honor

816
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:41,060
to have the Head of Baixiao Sect here

817
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:42,900
to deliver messages

818
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,180
to me every time.

819
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,220
Many people are keeping an eye

820
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:47,620
on Lord Yong'an's Residence.

821
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:48,860
Without martial arts,

822
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:50,060
I wouldn't have gotten in here.

823
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:51,060
Here.

824
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:55,660
This is the name list you want.

825
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,420
The toxin-making experts
who entered Tianqi City

826
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,340
and haven't left in the course of the year.

827
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,620
As expected of the Baixiao Sect.

828
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,140
There are seven people from the Tang Clan,

829
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,260
13 people from the Wen family,

830
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,780
three people from the Five Poisons Clan,

831
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,100
four people from Liusan Sect,

832
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:07,900
and some

833
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,100
small sects.

834
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:09,900
I don't know

835
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,380
[Ghost Physician Night Crow, Medicine Valley]
which one you're looking for.

836
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:13,580
Ghost Physician Night Crow?

837
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,940
I knew this name would catch

838
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:16,940
your eye first.

839
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,420
Hasn't this person

840
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,900
disappeared for a long time?

841
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:25,140
The three experts in Medicine Valley

842
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,540
were Medicine King Xin Baicao,

843
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:27,300
Divine Healer Bian Suchen,

844
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,580
and Ghost Physician Night Crow.

845
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:29,380
Ghost Physician Night Crow

846
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,900
was the youngest among them.

847
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,300
But the medicine she used

848
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,540
was the most strange among them.

849
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:34,940
And because of this,

850
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:36,180
she studied secret techniques

851
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,620
so she was evicted from the sect.

852
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,780
Then, it was said
that the medicine backfired on her.

853
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:40,460
And she died of that.

854
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:41,980
But Baixiao Sect

855
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:43,180
found her whereabouts

856
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:45,100
in Tianqi about six months ago.

857
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:46,740
Where is she now?

858
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,180
Do you know why

859
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,060
her name is Night Crow?

860
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:50,380
Besides

861
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:51,700
being a drug expert,

862
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,380
her qinggong skills are excellent as well.

863
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:54,020
We lost

864
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:55,380
track of her.

865
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,980
So her current whereabouts

866
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:57,980
are still unknown.

867
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:01,340
We must tell Hua Jin about this.

868
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,380
Are you sure it's her?

869
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:06,140
Medicine King Xin Baicao once said

870
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,460
that only an heir of Medicine Valley

871
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:09,620
can render

872
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:11,460
another heir

873
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,180
of Medicine Valley helpless.

874
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:22,980
[Night Crow]

875
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,620
Great.

876
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:40,980
I finally got

877
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:43,060
