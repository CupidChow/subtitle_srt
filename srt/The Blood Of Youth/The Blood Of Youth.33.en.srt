[Episode 33]

25
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:54,790
I can't make a decision

26
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,400
until the moment when the Langya Army

27
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,760
arrives at the city.

28
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,200
At this moment, I just hope

29
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,270
you could trust me once.

30
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,230
I see.

31
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:12,550
You want the commander's tally in my hands

32
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,600
that can mobilize Wangli Heavenly Soldiers.

33
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:16,630
That's right.

34
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,630
Is everyone here?

35
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,830
They have camped a li away.

36
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,830
Uncles,

37
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,200
do you think

38
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,440
those who are coming to join me now

39
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,440
are having mixed feelings?

40
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,480
After all, Father

41
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,630
didn't allow me to go to the army back then.

42
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,000
I don't know them well,

43
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:42,230
and I've never even met

44
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,230
most of them.

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,760
I have the title Lord Langya

46
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:53,000
because I inherited it from my father.

47
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,320
The troops only come to welcome me

48
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,790
because of my father's military prestige.

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,830
But these

50
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,920

00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,070
do you think

53
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:08,760
they will think

54
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,070
I am worthy of the title?

55
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,000
Never mind.

if Xiao Lingchen calls off the attack?

116
00:05:58,780 --> 00:05:59,780

00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,060
But there is another thing we need.

193
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,180
A joint handwritten letter

194
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,900
by all officials in the court.

195
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,580
I've got it here.

196
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,060
What about the most important person?

197
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,860
He has also written down his name.

198
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:58,820
It's going that smoothly?

199
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,780
Looks like Langya Army's approach

200
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,420
to Tianqi with a sweeping victory

201
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:04,900
has scared

202
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,460
the officials out of their wits.

203
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:08,780
But

204
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,580
there is one thing

205
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,420
that I find slightly odd.

206
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:17,700
You mean Marquis Lanyue?

207
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,620
From what Director knows,

208
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,420
the commander's tally
of Wangli Heavenly Soldiers

209
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,740
has been in the hands of Marquis Lanyue.

210
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,100
Now that the Langya Army is close by,

211
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,260
the Wangli Heavenly Soldiers,
which is 200 li away,

212
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,980
are supposed to be

213
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,060
quickly summoned into Tianqi City.

214
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,260
[Snowfall Villa]

215
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,380
Xiao Chuhe,

216
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,140
what are you still hesitating about?

217
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,820
Don't be anxious, Uncle.

218
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,780
Give me some more time.

219
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:48,260
Fine.

220
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,020
I will give you time.

221
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,020
Tell me then,

222
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:51,860
how long do you need?

223
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,620
The order to rescue the Emperor has been issued.

224
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,300
When will the other two armies
come to support Tianqi?

225
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,060
They will reach Tianqi

226
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,220
in three days.

227
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,220
But it will only take two days
for Langya Army to get here.

228
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:05,660
If we

229
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,380
summon Wangli Heavenly Soldiers into the city,

230
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,700
we only need to resist for one day.

231
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,100
And the reinforcement will come.

232
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,580
By then, we will be able to put down this rebellion

233
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,460
when we join forces.

234
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,380
Will it really be that simple?

235
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,300
Why did the two armies

236
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,180
come to support us

237
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,140
at such a coincidental speed?

238
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,620
It's not too fast or too slow.

239
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,820
It's exactly at this time.

240
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:27,780
Fine.

241
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,180
I will give you one more day.

242
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,260
One day later,

243
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,500
I will personally lead my men out of the city

244
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,260
to meet Wangli Heavenly Soldiers.

245
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,860
Thank you for your trust, Uncle.

246
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:51,540
Your Highness,

247
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,900
I am blind now,

248
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,420
but I can feel

249
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,820
that something is bothering you.

250
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,100
I just got the news.

251
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,140
Marquis Lanyue still hasn't summoned

252
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,020
Wangli Heavenly Soldiers.

253
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:04,820
General Li of Wangli Heavenly Soldiers

254
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,500
has already sent three military reports,

255
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,100
but he still hasn't received permission
to enter the city.

256
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:10,700
Wangli Heavenly Soldiers

257
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:11,900
is getting more anxious.

258
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,500
Of course they are anxious.

259
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,660
If they can't enter Tianqi,

260
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,100
they will

261
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,660
have to face the Langya Army head-on.

262
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,780
Wangli Heavenly Soldiers hasn't fought

263
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,180
a battle for more than a decade.

264
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:23,980
If they face them head-on,

265
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,020
they will only be beaten to a pulp.

266
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,100
Your Highness,

267
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,740
do you think

268
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:29,820
this could have been arranged

269
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:30,780
by Lord Yong'an?

270
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,140
What makes you think that?

271
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:35,220
Lord Yong'an

272
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,100
grew up

273
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,380
in Lord Langya's military camp.

274
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,780
He has been friends with Xiao Lingchen

275
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:40,540
and Ye Xiaoying.

276
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,460
Besides, it's obvious

277
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,100
that Marquis Lanyue

278
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,020
is taking his side.

279
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,420
Could he have intended

280
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:47,660
to stop

281
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,020
Wangli Heavenly Soldiers
from entering the city

282
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,540
while making it easy for Langya Army to do so?

283
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,140
Would you kill a thousand people

284
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,300
just to save one?

285
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,020
It

286
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,100
depends on

287
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:00,820
who I'm saving.

288
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,060
He is Lord Langya,

289
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,860
the hero who is revered by all

290
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,220
and the man whom Chuhe respects most.

291
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,700
If killing a man

292
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:12,700
will clear his name,

293
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,940
but if the man is innocent,

294
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,380
he won't do it.

295
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,740
This is who he is.

296
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,380
He believes

297
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,820
that a drop of unjust blood on his hands

298
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,980
is a stain on Lord Langya.

299
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:27,540
Therefore,

300
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:29,700
he will not

301
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,940
sacrifice all the people.

302
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,700
There is only one reason

303
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,860
why he won't dispatch Wangli Heavenly Soldiers.

304
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,340
That is he doesn't think

305
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,100
this is right.

306
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,380
[Snowfall Villa]

307
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:11,940
I don't want to play anymore.

308
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:13,900
My father personally

309
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,740
taught me how to play weiqi.

310
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,300
Yet I can never beat you.

311
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:19,820
You

312
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,460
are just too impatient.

313
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,260
Sometimes,

314
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,700
don't rush to admit defeat.

315
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,740
This may look like

316
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,780
you're bound to lose,

317
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,220
but you can turn the tables

318
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,180
with just one move.

319
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:34,540
It will be a twist.

320
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,660
How come I can't see it?

321
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,300
I'm not seeing it either.

322
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:45,940
It's chaos

323
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:46,900
out there.

324
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,500
I can't believe you are playing weiqi here.

325
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,060
If Marquis Lanyue knew about this,

326
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,300
he would probably be so furious
that he would cough up blood.

327
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:52,900
Ruoyi,

328
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,780
Xiao Se likes to keep people in suspense,

329
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:56,980
and you know it.

330
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,260
I'm pretty sure

331
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,100
he must already have an idea in mind.

332
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,500
You're wrong this time.

333
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,340
Look at this game.

334
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,260
It's as chaotic

335
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,860
as the current world.

336
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,860
I met Xiao Lingchen.

337
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,500
What did he say?

338
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,140
He said

339
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,380
he would trample Tianqi

340
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,580
and kill his way into Tai'an Hall.

341
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:23,620
And

342
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:24,820
he swore that

343
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,940
on his father's name.

344
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:26,860
Is that all?

345
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,020
In the end, he said,

346
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:30,620
"I, Xiao Lingchen,

347
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,020
carry the bloodline of Lord Langya,

348
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,380
so how can I withdraw?

349
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,420
You, Xiao Chuhe,

350
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,820
inherited the mantle of Lord Langya,

351
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,220
so how can you not fight?"

352
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,540
Oh no. This is bad.

353
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:39,980
He looked like

354
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,340
he was on our side before.

355
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:42,700
Now, it looks like

356
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,540
he is going to fight us to the death.

357
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,100
It is only when you are in a desperate situation

358
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,060
that you can find a way out.

359
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,340
I found

360
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,100
the twist.

361
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:01,860
Is that really what he said?

362
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:02,780
Yes.

363
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,300
Did he get hit in the head?

364
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,700
As far as I know, he didn't.

365
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:08,940
Where is he?

366
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,300
Why didn't he come and see me himself?

367
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,860
He said he was afraid

368
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,620
that you would chop him up.

369
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,420
So he had to run first.

370
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,620
He went to Baixiao Sect.

371
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,540
He's afraid that I would chop him up?

372
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,180
I see.

373
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:23,780
He, Ye Xiaoying,

374
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,100
and Xiao Lingchen are in cahoots.

375
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,100
That's what I thought

376
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,180
when I first heard what he say.

377
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,180
Why is he doing this?

378
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,300
Xiao Se asked you to trust him.

379
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:39,780
Trust him?

380
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,380
It would be over for us

381
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:43,860
if I made a wrong decision.

382
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,500
But even if you're right,

383
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,060
you might not win.

384
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,100
Marquis Lanyue has left the city.

385
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,940
He personally went to summon
Wangli Heavenly Soldiers.

386
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,180
Looks like

387
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,740
he has lost his patience.

388
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:04,660
Your Highness,

389
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,460
permission

390
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,140
to speak my mind?

391
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:11,740
Go on.

392
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,580
I think

393
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,580
what we are doing now

394
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,300
is very risky.

395
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:16,460
Many things

396
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,580
can go out of control.

397
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,300
First of all, when Langya Army enters the city,

398
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,020
we will

399
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,460
put ourselves in danger.

400
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,860
Second, what should we do
if two armies join forces

401
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,300
but are still no match

402
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,060
for the Langya Army?

403
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,300
War is a gamble.

404
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,570
No one knows the outcome

405
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,740
until they leave the table.

406
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:35,740
But sometimes,

407
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,260
you just have to take the risk.

408
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,300
Since I was little,

409
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:41,500
when I have something I want,

410
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,220
I take it myself.

411
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,220
I'm not afraid to lose.

412
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:52,100
Everyone,

413
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,100
Tianqi City is right in front of us.

414
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,940
I have waited for so many years.

415
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,500
This day has finally come.

416
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:13,460
Mr. Ye.

417
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,340
It's been so long since I looked at Tianqi

418
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,100
from this distance.

419
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,340
It's not long.

420
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,700
It was just a big dream.

421
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,740
The dragon roars

422
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,780
when it wakes up.

423
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:35,740
Mr. Ye,

424
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:36,700
Mrs. Ye told you

425
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,020
those words, didn't she?

426
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,980
When you fought in wars,

427
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:41,860
Mrs. Ye's

428
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,620
sword dance in a white dress was breathtaking.

429
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:46,820
My wife is gone,

430
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,260
but her white dress is still here.

431
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:50,660
Lingchen,

432
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,500
I'm happy

433
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,380
to have you back.

434
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:56,980
Mr. Ye,

435
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:58,500
why haven't

436
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,140
those two armies shown up yet?

437
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:00,940
I'm ready

438
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,540
for a fierce battle.

439
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,180
Be patient.

440
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,540
Those who are hiding in the shadows

441
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,580
do not dare to come out and confront you now.

442
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:11,780
Don't worry.

443
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,140
As long as you take down Tianqi,

444
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:14,980
those people

445
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,780
will come out then.

446
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,220
You

447
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,180
can fight with them then.

448
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,700
You are right, Mr. Ye.

449
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,060
They

450
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,260
are merely ants.

451
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,380
I'm not waiting for them.

452
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,140
I can't wait

453
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,700
to conquer Tianqi.

454
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,780
Conquer Tianqi?

455
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,100
As a soldier

456
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,300
or as an emperor?

457
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,100
As a soldier, for now.

458
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:46,620
My answer

459
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,860
may change in the future.

460
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:52,620
Let's go!

461
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:57,100
[Tianqi City]

462
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,060
Look. What is that?

463
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,060
Hurry!

464
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,740
Let's go! Let's go!

465
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:12,580
There will be a war.

466
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,020
Let's go.

467
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:15,940
Stop looking.

468
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:16,500
Let's go.

469
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:16,860
Leave it.

470
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,020
Divine Healer.

471
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:27,540
Divine Healer.

472
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:28,300
Your Majesty,

473
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,300
you're finally awake.

474
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:30,900
What is that sound?

475
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,060
That sounds like a horn

476
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,100
used on the battlefield.

477
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:36,700
Changqing!

478
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:37,660
Changqing!

479
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:39,620
Yes, Your Majesty.

480
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,060
What is happening out there?

481
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:41,980
Your Majesty,

482
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,020
Langya Army

483
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:43,980
is outside of Tianqi City.

484
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,620
They still came.

485
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:54,500
Your Highness,

486
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:55,820
we got a message from the palace.

487
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:56,500
His Majesty is awake.

488
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:57,340
Please

489
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,620
meet him at the Tai'an Hall, Your Highness.

490
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,020
He's awake?

491
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,660
At this timing?

492
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,540
But Marquis Lanyue

493
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,140
didn't bring Wangli Heavenly Soldiers back.

494
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,860
There are only city guards
and imperial soldiers

495
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:10,660
in the city.

496
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:15,780
Where do you think

497
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:17,860
Marquis Lanyue
has taken Wangli Heavenly Soldiers?

498
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,340
There are two possibilities.

499
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,540
One is that Marquis Lanyue

500
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,340
intends to confront
Langya Army outside the city.

501
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,420
He's fighting a hopeless battle then.

502
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,380
He has no chance of winning.

503
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:26,540
The second possibility

504
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,180
is Marquis Lanyue knows that there is no hope,

505
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,100
so he's abandoned the city and run away.

506
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:30,380
No.

507
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,180
There is another possibility.

508
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:33,860
Xiao Chuhe wants

509
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,780
to get Marquis Lanyue out of the city on purpose.

510
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,940
He wants to join forces

511
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,460
with Ye Xiaoying and Xiao Lingchen.

512
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,300
Does that mean Langya Army

513
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,060
will enter

514
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:42,860
Tianqi City unharmed?

515
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,060
No.

516
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,660
Even though
Wangli Heavenly Soldiers aren't here,

517
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,500
the imperial guards, Tiger Soldiers,

518
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,300
and the martial arts masters of Tianqi City

519
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,620
will still hit Langya Army hard.

520
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:53,980
All right.

521
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,260
Let's go to Tai'an Hall.

522
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,180
Your Highness,

523
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,820
why not avoid it at times like this?

524
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:01,820
No.

525
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,820
I don't want to miss

526
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,620
this good show today.

527
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,980
If I shoot a command arrow,

528
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,140
bring him into the palace.

529
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,020
With his protection,

530
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,380
even if there is a troop, they can't kill me.

531
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,780
I only got to know about

532
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,380
battlefield horns in books before.

533
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,180
Now that I have heard it with my own ears,

534
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,050
I feel that the descriptions in the book

535
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:33,540
couldn't convey

536
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,260
the tragic,

537
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,340
fearful,

538
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,700
and majestic sound of the horn.

539
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:43,500
Chunfeng,

540
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,820
I'm not as calm as you are.

541
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,620
And I'm not as poetic as you.

542
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,500
All I know is

543
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:50,940
we are dying.

544
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:54,820
We will be trampled

545
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,980
by the horses of the Langya Army?

546
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,420
How irony.

547
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,780
When I was little,

548
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,140
I only heard that Langya Army

549
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,140
kept Beili safe and peaceful.

550
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,060
They were like gods

551
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,380
from heaven

552
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:09,860
who were revered by all,

553
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,500
but now...

554
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,900
But, Master,

555
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,900
I won't let you die.

556
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,460
I'll take you out of the palace now.

557
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,300
We are not officials and have no positions here.

558
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,380
Langya Army

559
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,740
won't make things difficult for us, I think.

560
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:30,620
Are you sure?

561
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:31,980
Don't worry.

562
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:35,420
Xiao Se told me

563
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,740
about a safe place.

564
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,900
Miss Sikong will protect us.

565
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,540
Tianqi.

566
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:49,100
Tianqi City is originally a military city.

567
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:50,820
It's defensible.

568
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,220
How many days will it take

569
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,340
for our army to invade this city?

570
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,300
If I'm not mistaken,

571
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:02,180
the largest battle force in this city

572
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,380
is Wangli Heavenly Soldiers.

573
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,460
Although this army's combat power isn't strong,

574
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,140
its Tianji Crossbow Formation

575
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,260
is perfect for defending the city.

576
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,660
So,

577
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,620
even Langya Army

578
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,740
needs two days

579
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:18,420
to take the city.

580
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,260
What if we attack it

581
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,540
regardless of all costs?

582
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,740
One day.

583
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,860
How disappointing.

584
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,380
I was expecting

585
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,940
to fight a fierce battle

586
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,020
to take the city.

587
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:43,980
They're surrendering already?

588
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:45,700
What is going on?

589
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,900
You are worried that it might be a trap?

590
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:50,580
Yes.

591
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,420
Something like this has happened before.

592
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,300
They opened the gate

593
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,900
and let the enemy in.

594
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,780
Then, they killed the general

595
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:00,940
to repel the army.

596
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,340
In a hopelessly deadly battle,

597
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,380
this is their only chance.

598
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:07,660
So,

599
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,340
we can't rule out

600
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,660
that they have made this plan.

601
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,900
The gate is open.

602
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,420
Are we going

603
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,660
to let them intimidate us?

604
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,820
Kill the general?

605
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,740
I am right here.

606
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,580
My head is right here!

607
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,180
Come and get it!

608
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:25,540
Enter the city!

609
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,180
Has Tianqi City

610
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:38,620
been invaded

611
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,980
by the army of 200,000 soldiers?

612
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,300
Is the army led by Lingchen?

613
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:48,860
Your Majesty,

614
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:49,820
he's accompanied

615
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,300
by General Ye Xiaoying.

616
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:53,900
Lingchen

617
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,740
is a kind-hearted boy,

618
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:57,860
just like his father.

619
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,420
At least Tianqi City

620
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,220
won't suffer casualties.

621
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,060
Pass my order

622
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,300
to avoid unnecessary clashes.

623
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,300
We...

624
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,260
We'll wait for him here.

625
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:14,700
Your Majesty,

626
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:15,500
the order

627
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,420
to rescue the Emperor was delivered

628
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,100
while you were in a coma.

629
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,940
You should retreat to Sword Pavilion now

630
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,180
and wait for the arrival of reinforcements.

631
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,500
There are 200,000 soldiers.

632
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,420
What's the point in retreating

633
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,740
to Sword Pavilion?

634
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:27,860
These men here

635
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,300
are loyal soldiers of Beili.

636
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,370
If we retreat,

637
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:33,900
they will have to fight to the death for us.

638
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,020
Are you going

639
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,860
to let them die in this unnecessary war?

640
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:46,340
Unnecessary?

641
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:08,540
Whenever my father

642
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,100
returned home after winning a battle back then,

643
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,060
he would ride slowly

644
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,340
down the street like this.

645
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,380
Everywhere he went,

646
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,820
people knelt and bowed.

647
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,380
Their eyes were filled with reverence.

648
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:24,540
But now, they don't even

649
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,140
have the courage to come out

650
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:27,860
and take a look.

651
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,900
A lot of people have changed.

652
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:32,500
This city

653
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,900
is not the Tianqi City it once was.

654
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,820
Tianqi has been dead

655
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:41,100
since the day my father died.

656
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:43,180
Lingchen,

657
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:44,620
those people

658
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,820
should be waiting for us

659
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,420
in Tai'an Hall now.

660
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,060
Let them wait a little longer then.

661
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,580
Please wait for me too, General.

662
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:54,820
I need to drop by Imperial Ancestral Shrine.

663
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:02,460
State Preceptor,

664
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:03,980
what's your plan?

665
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,740
I will follow fate.

666
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,860
Whose side will fate be on?

667
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,100
Many years ago,

668
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,980
it was on Lord Langya's side,

669
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:22,860
but he gave it up.

670
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,540
Even if the immortals come,

671
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:32,100
they won't be able to drive out 200,000 soldiers.

672
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:36,940
[Imperial Ancestral Shrine]

673
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,180
Great Uncle.

674
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,180
Lingchen?

675
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:07,420
It's me, Great Uncle.

676
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,660
You're back.

677
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,260
This is great.

678
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:17,540
Do you really think

679
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:18,940
it's great?

680
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,340
[Memorial Tablet of Xiao Yi, Beili]
Ruofeng was convicted of treason.

681
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,260
His name

682
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,340
won't be enshrined
in the Imperial Ancestral Shrine.

683
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:29,860
His name will be here tomorrow.

684
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:32,820
Great Uncle,

685
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,660
please give me an incense stick.

686
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,540
Dear ancestors,

687
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,380
coming back this time,

688
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,740
I shall set down the rebellion

689
00:28:58,940 --> 00:28:59,740
for my imperial family

690
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,060
and reestablish the Imperial Court.

691
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:25,980
Protect His Highness!

692
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,980
State Preceptor has loved me since I was a child.

693
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:35,380
Don't worry.

694
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:36,980
He won't kill me.

695
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,100
How have you been

696
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:45,780
after all these years?

697
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,180
I haven't been doing well.

698
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:48,660
I haven't eaten well

699
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,060
or slept well.

700
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,620
But ever since

701
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:53,940
I set foot in Tianqi City,

702
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,700
I started to feel a little better.

703
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,140
How so?

704
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:02,940
It feels good that I will get
to kill the people I want to kill.

705
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,140
You're a lot like your father,

706
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:10,100
but your father wouldn't do

707
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,060
such a thing.

708
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,660
That's because

709
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:16,380
my father

710
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,700
was not young

711
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,980
when those things happened to him.

712
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:21,780
But I'm young.

713
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,700
I still have the chance to make mistakes.

714
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,260
Some mistakes are redeemable,

715
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,300
but there are certain mistakes

716
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,460
that will make you have no chance

717
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,340
to repeat them again in life.

718
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,220
Tell me then,

719
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,540
my father was executed back then.

720
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:40,860
What mistake did he make?

721
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,660
Lord Langya didn't make any mistakes.

722
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,100
Yes.

723
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,380
Emperor Mingde is the one who made a mistake.

724
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:51,780
So shouldn't he

725
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,140
pay the price?

726
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:58,740
State Preceptor,

727
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,860
perhaps it takes hundreds of years

728
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:05,420
for a man like my father to appear.

729
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,140
He was revered by people,

730
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:11,740
but I don't want to be him.

731
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,060
Chuhe.

732
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:29,420
Yes, Father.

733
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:34,340
You grew up with Lingchen.

734
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,380
Remember

735
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,620
to give him advice when the time comes.

736
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,140
There must be no infighting

737
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,460
within the Xiao family.

738
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,340
The grudges and feud

739
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,300
between

740
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,580
Ruofeng and me

741
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,620
should end here.

742
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:54,700
Don't worry, Father.

743
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,220
I will protect Tianqi,

744
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,900
the Xiao family,

745
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:01,860
and you.

746
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,380
Chuhe...

747
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:06,460
That's absurd.

748
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,180
Which of my words

749
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,140
you think is absurd, Yu?

750
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,900
I heard that Marquis Lanyue went to your house

751
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,260
two days ago

752
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:22,500
and he left the city the next day.

753
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,420
He said he was going to meet
Wangli Heavenly Soldiers,

754
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:26,980
but he has not returned yet.

755
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,180
I also heard

756
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,740
that Marquis Lanyue
had given the order in advance

757
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:33,860
for Tianqi City's gates to be opened

758
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,180
to welcome Langya Army into the city.

759
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:38,980
I think you and Marquis Lanyue

760
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,020

761

with the rebels

762
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,660
to give away

763
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,780
Tianqi City.

764
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,260
I didn't expect you to be so well-informed

765
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,420
despite staying in your residence all the time.

766
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,580
What do you want us to do then?

767
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,620
Let Langya Army

768
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,220
and Wangli Heavenly Soldiers have a bloodbath

769
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,340
and pay a heavy price?

770
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,340
Let them kill their way into Tianqi City,

771
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,060
step on the corpses of the people of Tianqi City

772
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,500
as they continue to kill
their way into Tai'an Hall,

773
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:17,020
and then kill

774
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,980
all the imperial family members?

775
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,660
So that the upper army and the lower army

776
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,980
can reap the benefits?

777
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,340
All troops! On alert!

778
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,540
They still came in.

779
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,100
Langya Army.

780
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,260
Open the palace gate.

781
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:56,500
Your Majesty!

782
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:59,140
I don't want unnecessary casualties.

783
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:03,500
I will wait for him here.

784
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,100
Open the palace gate!

785
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,220
He looks just like him.

786
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:41,500
Chong'er.

787
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:51,380
Lingchen,

788
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,380
I didn't know you would still be alive.

789
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:55,940
Chong,

790
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,020

791
00:34:58,860 --> 00:34:59,180
Yes.

792
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,340
I didn't expect

793
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,300
that the first thing I saw

794
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:06,140
after I regained my sight is your rebellion.

795
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,780
Did I rebel?

796
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:10,900
Why do I feel like

797
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,180
I'm home?

798
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,820
It's Jinyan and Eunuch Zhuoxin.

799
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:36,740
Eunuch Zhuoxin

800
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,460
is the only survivor

801
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:39,660
of the last Five Eunuchs.

802
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,780
He is not allowed to leave the mausoleum
without an imperial order.

803
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,900
What are you doing here, Eunuch Zhuoxin?

804
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:49,180
You left the mausoleum
without an imperial order.

805
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:50,860
You will be executed!

806
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:53,820
I'm here to reestablish the Imperial Court!

807
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,980
I have the Dragon Seal Scroll in my hand.

808
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:07,060
It's written by the late Emperor himself.

809
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,860
Kneel at once.

810
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:09,820
Kneel!

811
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:17,780
With a scroll

812
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:18,980
that no one knows is real or not,

813
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,380
you want to bring us to our knees.

814
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:22,340
Zhuoxin,

815
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,060

817
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:27,460
in Dragon Seal Scroll

818
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,940
is Lord Langya, Xiao Ruofeng.

819
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,660
Emperor Mingde, Xiao Ruojin,

820
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,420
disobeyed it and usurped the throne.

821
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,220
He forced Lord Langya

822
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,340
to tear up the scroll

823
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,740
and finally ascended the throne.

824
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,060
We, the Five Eunuchs,

825
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:47,860
have endured humiliation over the years.

826
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:50,700
I finally got this scroll now.

827
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:52,580
So we are going to reestablish the Imperial Court,

828
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:56,420
put the right heir on the throne,

829
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,660
welcome the son of Lord Langya,

830
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,260
Xiao Lingchen, back to Tianqi,

831
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:05,100
overthrow Emperor Mingde, and have a new emperor!

832
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,500
You darned eunuch!

833
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:13,500
What nonsense are you spouting?

834
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,250
It has the stamp of the imperial seal on it.

835
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,980
It was written by the late Emperor.

836
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:20,460
It can't be fake.

837
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,700

in front of everyone.

841
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:33,660
How could he possibly be forced?

842
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:36,980
Besides,

843
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:38,940
if he was forced,

844
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,860
why did you Five Eunuchs

845
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,380
sit by and do nothing?

846
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,140
Chong'er, calm down.

847
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:50,260
Let him talk.

848
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,580
We owe it to the late Emperor.

849
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:54,780

850
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:57,980

and the re-establishment of the Imperial Court.

858
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,740
