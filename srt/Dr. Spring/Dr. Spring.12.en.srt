00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,760
=Dr. Spring=

2
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,140
Raise your legs.

3
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,140
Mr. Ling, were you trying to check here?

4
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,420
Uh... Yes.

5
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,140
How dare you!

6
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,140
Elder Madam, my apologies.

7
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,180
=Episode 12=
Abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea,

8
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,340
vomiting, and referred pain
in the lower right abdomen?

9
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:43,180
What? A woman in her sixties
suddenly gets pregnant?

10
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:47,100
Nonsense! Get an imperial physician!

11
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,580
- I...
- Don't move.

12
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,660
Quick! Get an imperial physician!

13
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,660
Does it hurt here?

14
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,020
Quick!

15
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,340
- Does it hurt here, Elder Madam?
- Don't move.

16
00:01:56,924 --> 00:01:58,060
Knockout drops.

17
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,100
What?

18
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,060
You're an assassin.
You must have that thing.

19
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:06,620
Ah, hurry up! It hurts!

20
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,300
Hold your breath.

21
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,500
Hurry up! You have to bear with it!

22
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,524
Ouch.

23
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,716
Don't be afraid.

24
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,092
I need your knife.

25
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,500
It isn't a stomach ache.
It's acute appendicitis.

26
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,540
She's in a dangerous fever.
We can't delay it.

27
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,100
But it's just a minor surgery.

28
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,180
Surgery?

29
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,196
Yes.

30
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,980
What are you waiting for?
Hurry up! Help me!

31
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,780
They serve as the shadowless lamp.

32
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,780
Shadowless lamp?

33
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:41,220
Yes. If only we really had
a shadowless lamp.

34
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,980
It can not only light the surgical area,

35
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,940
but also minimize the interference
of shadows during the operation.

36
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,340
Boiling water.

37
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,500
You've mentioned this before.
Sterilization.

38
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,420
Go help him. I can handle it.

39
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,420
Why? Do you want to quit?

40
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,780
Compared to him,
I'm more worried about you.

41
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,236
Let's begin.

42
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,260
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

43
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:55,660
What did you do to her?

44
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,452
Lock them up!

45
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,756
Separately!

46
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,372
(The Prime Minister's Residence)

47
00:07:32,316 --> 00:07:33,980
(OK?)

48
00:07:55,228 --> 00:07:56,316
(OK)

49
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,660
(The whole residence has been searched.)

50
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,980
(Could such a large secret room vanish?)

51
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,380
(What if we can't find it?)

52
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:41,900
(Big trouble. When entering
Lingxue Pavilion,)

53
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,940
(each of us received our own urns.)

54
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,620
(It was a warning.)

55
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:51,780
(We live for the mission.
We must die for it, too.)

56
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,060
(But what if Prime Minister Li
isn't here anymore?)

57
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,980
(We haven't been here for long.)

58
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,500
(Since he has designed such a layout,)

59
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,860
(he wouldn't leave in such a hurry)

60
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,540
(before finding a safer place to hide.)

61
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,300
(We still have a chance.)

62
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,460
(It's just that we don't have
much time left.)

63
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:44,180
Yeah, we haven't really had the chance
to hang out together.

64
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,732
(The scent of flowers.)

65
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:05,460
(Yes. It must be drifting over
from the Moon Hall.)

66
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:08,780
(Some petals were drifting over
when I first entered the residence.)

67
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,980
(I've smelled it before.)

68
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,660
(Are you sure petals were
drifting over that day?)

69
00:10:25,664 --> 00:10:28,180
(Can we have the appendix removed
to prevent disease?)

70
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,420
(Gao Tianni as Li Liuyan)
The appendix is a small tube

71
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,740
attached to the large intestine.

72
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:35,460
The appendix is considered an appendage.

73
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:38,860
It has long been thought
to have no apparent function,

74
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,900
but recent research suggests

75
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:44,620
that it may play a certain role
in the immune system.

76
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,540
It may not have a well-defined function,

77
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:50,620
but its inflammation can lead to
serious health problems,

78
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,860
and even threaten life.

79
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,780
Therefore, usually,

80
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,660
doctors do not advocate for
preventive removal of it,

81
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,100
because the surgery itself is risky,

82
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,820
and complications may arise.
