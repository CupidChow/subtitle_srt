1
00:01:14,884 --> 00:01:17,504
=Dr. Spring=

2
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,160
(Since our intel is solid,)

3
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,160
=Episode 8=
(the entrance must be here.)

4
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,520
(Let's split up
to find the entrance and get Li.)

5
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,852
(Zhang Cui'e, the Mistress of
the Prime Minister's Residence)

6
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,200
(Why is there a smell of medicine?)

7
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,180
Greetings, Madam.

8
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,140
Arise.

9
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:17,340
My lady, Madam has prepared
the wine and dishes for you.

10
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,540
(Maybe I'm the dish to be eaten.)

11
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,540
Mr. Ling, I'm ready.

12
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,860
It's cold, so you'd better wear more.

13
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,820
(He cares about my well-being.
He loves me.)

14
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:07,420
I see. Mr. Ling, have a seat.

15
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,748
This is the son of Mr. Ji,
the judicial official.

16
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:19,020
He is down-to-earth, honest and steady,
and does not like to go out.

17
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,620
Greetings, my lady.

18
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,540
Greetings, sir.

19
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,780
(With only one leg, he can't go out
even if he wants.)

20
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,540
This is the son of the Censor.

21
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,420
Among so many portraits,
he chose you at one glance.

22
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,100
Greetings, my lady.

23
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:48,260
(Indeed, he has only one eye.)

24
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,300
Greetings, sir.

25
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,332
How is it?

26
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,300
Your pulse indicates
symptoms of deficiency.

27
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,860
You're cold outside and hot inside.

28
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:14,220
(He pays attention to my temperament.
He loves me.)

29
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,700
This is the second son
of the Imperial Censor.

30
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,460
He has enjoyed
the government's provision.

31
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,700
He was released from prison.

32
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,740
He killed someone?

33
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,420
But he doesn't kill anymore.

34
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,860
So, is there a cure for my illness?

35
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:40,500
I like Miss Chunri.

36
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,220
Sir, are you alright?

37
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,980
These are the noble gentlemen
of high-ranking officials.

38
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,060
You can't be their official wife,

39
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,740
but okay to be a concubine.

40
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,140
(Where exactly could
Prime Minister Li be?)

41
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,220
You need to give birth to their kids.

42
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,900
Don't bring shame on our family.

43
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,660
From the perspective of Feng Shui,

44
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:23,900
there is ghost in this room.

45
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,900
My lady, Madam knew you would visit us,

46
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,340
and ordered us to prepare the new tea.

47
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,700
She asked us to treat you well.

48
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,060
Then, this first cup...

49
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,180
I should make a toast to Madam.

50
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,580
Sir, don't scare me. I get frightened.

51
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,580
Gosh.

52
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,580
(He reacted so intensely.)

53
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:15,260
I mean the grand
Prime Minister's Residence

54
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,780
can't be disturbed by the evil spirit.

55
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,580
Don't worry. I will find it out.

56
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,820
Promise me. Don't leave
until you find it.

57
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,740
(Let me make matters worse.)

58
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,260
Sorry, Madam. I have to change my clothes
in the inner chamber,

59
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,020
in case I'm indiscreet
before the honored guests.

60
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,500
The inner chamber is there, right?

61
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,820
Hey! How dare you!

62
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,380
Didn't your mom teach you
how to host guests properly?

63
00:06:46,428 --> 00:06:48,060
- Miss, have you been scalded?
- No, no.

64
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,300
Have you been scalded?

65
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,020
If you like them so much,

66
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,180
keep them for yourself.

67
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,420
How dare you! After her!

68
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,820
Madam, I don't need to do so, right?

69
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,260
My lady, you said the Prime Minister
moved out due to illness.

70
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,300
Doesn't your mom take care of him?

71
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,180
(Is he afraid
that my father won't agree?)

72
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:19,940
Don't worry.
My mom can determine my affairs.

73
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,900
What is behind?

74
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,380
There's nothing.

75
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,364
No.

76
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,476
I failed the task
and offended the Madam.

77
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,556
What should I do?

78
00:08:05,756 --> 00:08:06,860
Miss.

79
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,512
What are you here for?

80
00:08:08,512 --> 00:08:09,692
What for?

81
00:08:09,692 --> 00:08:11,900
To comfort you.

82
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,268
Let me go!

83
00:08:15,868 --> 00:08:16,940
What is this?

84
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,060
Once the Lust Pill works,

85
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,148
we shall have a great time together.

86
00:08:21,148 --> 00:08:22,180
Let me go!

87
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:44,220
At least for now,
I can't wear it for you.

88
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:16,020
(What's going on with my body?)

89
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,020
Mr. Ling, are you alright?

90
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,060
Let me go!

91
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,100
Once it works,
we'll have a good time together.

92
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:33,020
Get away, get away!

93
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:47,620
Mr. Ling, I'm not ready yet.

94
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:10,900
(I am right. He is a gentleman.)

95
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,460
Try to run? After her!

96
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,220
Bro, don't let her get away.

97
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,140
Come here.

98
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,780
She is Prime Minister's daughter.

99
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:25,980
Will it cause trouble for us?

100
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,580
How about we just scare her?

101
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,340
It's almost done.
We won't have such a chance.

102
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:33,780
Help! Help!

103
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,180
(How do you know you're in love?
Why does one blush when in love?)

104
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:46,100
(Wu Jifeng as Ling Xinghe)
The normal heartbeat sounds like

105
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,180
thump, thump.

106
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,540
It is caused by two key actions,

107
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:56,220
a contraction and a relaxation.

108
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,100
When you meet that special one,

109
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,540
the sympathetic nervous system
gets activated,

110
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,900
causing the heart to beat faster,

111
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,140
known as tachycardia.

112
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,940
And when you fall in love,

113
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,020
your body releases hormones,
like adrenaline.

114
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,940
It causes your blood vessels to dilate,

115
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,940
especially the micro-vessels
in your face.

116
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:19,868
Then more blood will flow to
the facial skin and cause blushing.

117
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:24,060
That's why people blush
when they fall in love.

118
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:27,140
But blushing doesn't mean
one falls in love.
