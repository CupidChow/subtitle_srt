00:01:14,692 --> 00:01:17,792
=Dr. Spring=

2
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,220
How did you get injured?

3
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,660
=Episode 2=

4
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:32,140
What's going on?
What have you done to me?

5
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,244
I don't know.

6
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:39,580
How did you wake up?

7
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,116
I...

8
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,580
Go and take control of Miss Li.

9
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:54,020
Do not touch her nor harm her.

10
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,100
Yes, sir.

11
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,620
So you really are a killer.

12
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,460
Forget it. Since he won't kill me,
I need to get out of here.

13
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,540
(Prime Minister Li?)

14
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,300
Miss Li, you can't leave.

15
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,980
Miss Li, you can't escape.

16
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,540
Guys, do me a favor.

17
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,780
Kill me right now. Thank you.

18
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,524
Cut me, please.

19
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,340
You're quite fast.

20
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,452
It's you again?

21
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:57,060
You are not going to kill me?

22
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,820
Xinghe, listen to me.
No matter what happens,

23
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,460
do not make a sound or come out.
Did you hear me?

24
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,060
Hide. Hurry up.

25
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,340
Hide. Get down.

26
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,860
Take this.
Don't make a sound or come out.

27
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,140
Miss Li, please come down.

28
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,900
It's windy, and it's dangerous
to stand on the roof.

29
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,460
You can leave now.

30
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,740
Don't follow me anymore.

31
00:05:14,076 --> 00:05:15,196
Miss Li...

32
00:05:15,196 --> 00:05:16,900
Go down. I'll handle the rest myself.

33
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,196
Miss Li!

34
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:38,540
It's a pity that I have no time
to appreciate the beautiful scenery.

35
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,620
Miss Li!

36
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,740
Why is it you again? Hey...

37
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,180
Don't move. Behave.

38
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:16,660
Don't pull me like this.
If I fall on my face, I'll die horribly.

39
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,580
If you keep struggling,
you'll die more horribly.

40
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,860
Let go of me!

41
00:06:33,404 --> 00:06:34,428
What are you going to do?

42
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,940
Don't be moved. I'm not dying for you.

43
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,348
Guys, shoot right now.

44
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,660
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

45
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,028
Pretty much.

46
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:46,684
Guys, can you kill me?

47
00:06:46,684 --> 00:06:48,300
- Shoot right away!
- Shut up.

48
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,460
Give me a quick death!

49
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,500
Are you done? Shut up now.

50
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,620
None of you guys can do it?
Come on, man!

51
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,420
What's wrong with you?

52
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:28,780
Listen, death is neither easy
nor pleasant.

53
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,420
Moreover, you have to stay alive
for me now.

54
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,820
The offering went wrong.

55
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,100
I'm willing to pay for that
with my life.

56
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,420
Come closer.

57
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,420
Do you think anyone can die for me?

58
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,380
Do you know how long
I have waited for this moment?

59
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:00,900
This terrible illness has tormented me
for so long.

60
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:06,340
I thought I would be cured today.
It's all because of you!

61
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,500
If the assassin hadn't used Miss Li
to shield himself,

62
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,300
we would have executed him on the spot.

63
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:14,900
What did you say?
That assassin touched Chunri?

64
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,260
They indeed had physical contact.

65
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,020
Could they...?

66
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,500
Symbiosis can only be formed
with close kin.

67
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:29,780
Otherwise, why would I hide
a natural daughter for so many years?

68
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:35,980
Bring her back alive.

69
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,020
Understood.

70
00:08:39,136 --> 00:08:40,572
(Ling's Clinic)

71
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,860
You run a clinic?

72
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:59,060
Are you also a physician?
We sort of do the same job.

73
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,020
Then let's not make things difficult
for one another.

74
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,828
Again?

75
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,860
Get dressed properly.

76
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,700
What on earth is that?
I'm scared to death.

77
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,628
This snake is supposed to be used
to make venom powder.

78
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,300
Weren't you very brave earlier?

79
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,780
I know it's for stopping the bleeding.

80
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:46,140
Tell me what you have done to me.

81
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,740
I can consider sparing your life.

82
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:06,580
So tell me how you will kill me.

83
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,076
Tell me about it.

84
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:20,580
You like this sort of thing. Alright.

85
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,620
What? Haven't you seen it
in the medicine pool already?

86
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,580
Get dressed properly.

87
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,060
What are you doing?

88
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,260
I was just joking.
Don't take it seriously.

89
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,500
Listen, I didn't pay for
any additional services.

90
00:11:00,736 --> 00:11:03,280
(Is fighting poison
with poison effective?)

91
00:11:03,316 --> 00:11:04,860
(Wu Jifeng as Ling Xinghe)
You must have wondered

92
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,180
if fighting poison
with poison is dangerous.

93
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:09,660
If we use snake venom
for anti-inflammatory and hemostasis,

94
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,580
will we be killed by the venom first?

95
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,220
In fact, the toxins in snake venom

96
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:18,900
include neurotoxins,
cruor toxins, and cytotoxins.

97
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,420
They can cause serious damage

98
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:23,612
to the nervous system,
coagulation, and tissues.

99
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:27,660
Once the snake venom enters the body,
it can cause serious toxicities

100
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,980
including poisoning,
allergic reactions, and tissue necrosis.

101
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,140
These reactions
could be life-threatening.

102
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,820
So without professional guidance,

103
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:40,020
it's not recommended
to fight poison with poison.

104
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:44,300
The dose of poison is unpredictable
and uncontrollable.

105
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,420
It's difficult to determine

106
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:49,380
how much snake venom is needed
for anti-inflammatory and hemostasis

107
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,980
without triggering serious toxicities.

108
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:55,980
There are safer and more effective ways
in modern medicine

109
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,620
to deal with infections
and control bleeding.

110
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,660
Seek professional treatment
when necessary.
