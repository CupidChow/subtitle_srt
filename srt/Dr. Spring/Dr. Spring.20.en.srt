=Episode 20=
Do you know?

3
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:46,940
Before I met you,
I thought my life had no color.

4
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,340
It was as if I had never lived.

5
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,060
Thank you
for bringing color into my life.

6
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,100
I thought I wasn't afraid to die.

7
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:15,660
But, when facing death,
I'm a bit reluctant to let go.

8
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,060
We promised to live and die together.

9
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:33,460
I'm sorry,
I might have to break my words.

10
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,900
Let's start anew.

11
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:18,380
Hi there, my name is Zhang Ziqi,
and I am a doctor.

12
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:27,980
Let me complete your final task for you.

13
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,860
Lady Chunri, it's time to go.

14
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,700
Welcoming the deity.

15
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:27,740
Showing respect to the heavens.

16
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,380
(Is it time to go back?)

17
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,620
Final sacrifice.

18
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:32,420
Before that,
I must kill your husband first.

19
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,060
Teach me some self-defense moves.

20
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,020
This move is to take
preventive measures.

21
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,420
Want to kill me? You're not even close.

22
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:27,180
Xinghe, Xinghe.

23
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,700
Why?

24
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:21,460
D-Do you still remember what I told you?

25
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,860
I will always protect you.

26
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,580
It's time to cross the bridge.
Never look back.

27
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,180
I can't let you off easily.

28
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,500
Li Chunri, you silly girl.

29
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,180
Ling Xinghe, you scared me to death,
do you know that?

30
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,740
So you letting me follow you

31
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,700
is to prevent this kind
of situation from happening?

32
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,940
I will definitely protect you.

33
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,220
Help! Help!

34
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,340
Protecting you is my responsibility.

35
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:12,700
And more so because I like you.

36
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:22,020
No, no, don't!

37
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,740
Ling Xinghe!

38
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:33,540
Ling Xinghe, Ling Xinghe.

39
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,476
(Your one-week brain-computer service
'An Adventure in Spring' has ended)

40
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,940
Zhang Ziqi,
what have you been up to these days?

41
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:24,660
You know the hospital is short-staffed,
how dare you take time off?

42
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:28,300
It hurts so bad, someone help me.

43
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:31,260
What's wrong?

44
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,460
Doctor, someone kicked me.

45
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,020
Who? And where did he kick?

46
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:38,580
It's this child. He keeps kicking
my stomach. What should I do?

47
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,580
I got it, Chief.

48
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,460
Alright, Doctor Zhang,
I'll leave her to you.

49
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,940
What's wrong, where does it hurt?

50
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,940
The stomach hurts so much
from being kicked, am I okay?

51
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,740
It's fine, come on, let's go up.

52
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:01,180
Excuse me, is this your phone?

53
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,900
Ling Xinghe, you big liar!

54
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,580
(This game was made just for you.)

55
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,780
(It's all about our past stories.)

56
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:22,260
(You have finally returned, Chunri.)

57
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:39,420
We're closed today,
please come early tomorrow.

58
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,228
Do me a favor.

59
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,260
I am not sure what I can do for you.

60
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,420
Compose a poem.

61
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:52,220
Would it be for expressing feelings
or for commemoration?

62
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,300
Could you tell me
the details of the event?

63
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,580
Explain to me
from the beginning to the end.

64
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:05,540
So I can draft it,
even if it's just some key words.

65
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,500
This...

66
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,740
Young master,
you forgot your things, you...

67
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,110
(Outing in the Spring Day.)

68
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,740
(Horse steps on the misty grass.)

69
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,600
(Beautiful scenery
but too much sadness.)

70
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,860
(Butterfly dust on the wings
gradually faded away.)

71
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,270
(Crow flies with its back
to the sunset.)

72
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,716
(The enchanting willow makes
the beauty even more worried.)

73
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,980
(The undulating mountains
are like the furrowed brows of her.)

74
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,380
(Nowhere to express
the feelings in the heart.)

75
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,648
(The two hearts are separated,
as distant as the Milky Way.)

76
00:13:53,512 --> 00:13:55,492
(End of the play)

77
00:14:10,952 --> 00:14:13,284
(The Tomb of Yao Xiyang)

78
00:14:25,712 --> 00:14:29,184
(The Tomb of Yao Xiyang)

79
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:45,900
(When a fetus kicks a pregnant woman,
is it irritated or uncomfortable?)

80
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,040
(Gao Tianni as Li Liuyan)
A fetus kicking in the womb

81
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,420
is usually not due to irritation.

82
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,220
The movement of a fetus
is a normal physiological phenomenon.

83
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,940
It indicates the fetus
is growing and developing.

84
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:57,700
These movements
are typically automatic responses.

85
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,660
They are not influenced by emotions.

86
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:03,220
The fetus's kicking helps
the development of bones and muscles.

87
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:06,020
It's a way to exercise its own muscles
and nervous system.

88
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,980
The fetus even
has its own biological clock.

89
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,260
Usually, it is more active
when the mother rests.

90
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:14,100
Sometimes it reacts to sound, light and
other stimuli outside of the mom's body,

91
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:18,180
causing more movements.
