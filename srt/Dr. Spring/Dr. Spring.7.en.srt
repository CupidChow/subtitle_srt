00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,544
(Ling's Clinic)

3
00:01:26,506 --> 00:01:27,215
Yao?

4
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,400
You're finally back.

5
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:33,800
Let me tell you, a little thief stole
a lot of money from the clinic today.

6
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,016
You...

7
00:01:39,108 --> 00:01:41,280
=Episode 7=

8
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,840
Why are you hurt?

9
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,840
It's a long story.
Help me get some medicine.

10
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,880
Let's go inside.

11
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,480
Is this his ancestral property?

12
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,760
What does it have to do with you?

13
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,480
It has nothing to do with you, either.

14
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,760
Two ladies?

15
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:03,200
Don't tell me you were playing the field
and got beaten for it?

16
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,640
Mr. Ling, those insidious villains
that you just dealt with,

17
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,112
they must all come after my family.

18
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,960
If they want money, give it to them.
I'll cover it for you.

19
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,560
I know you did all this because of me.

20
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,800
You're overthinking it.
This really has nothing to do with you.

21
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,600
Has nothing to do with me?
Does it concern you?

22
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,320
The person behind this
is indeed well-intentioned.

23
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,320
That's right. If we hadn't
moved that cold-blooded assassin...

24
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,880
Ladies, may I have your names?

25
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,760
How old are you, and are you married?

26
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,120
I'm older than her,
the legitimate eldest daughter.

27
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,000
You're sisters? It's okay.

28
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,440
Young lady, if now

29
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,432
someone would like to make chicken soup
for Physician Ling,

30
00:03:06,432 --> 00:03:08,740
wouldn't he remember you for a lifetime?

31
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,200
Then, will you come with me?

32
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,200
Although I've seen
and eaten that before,

33
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,440
I may still need your help.

34
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,240
Sure, please.

35
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,080
I've caused trouble for you.

36
00:03:41,156 --> 00:03:42,680
(Red-Head Crane Poison)

37
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,680
If you really want to end this,

38
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,120
you better drink this yourself.

39
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,160
You want to die so badly?

40
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,160
I don't want to harm you. I just...

41
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,720
Forget it. It's complicated.
I can't explain.

42
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,320
Actually, before I came here,

43
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,120
I hadn't seen the sun for a long time.

44
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,760
I thought I could
finally catch my breath here,

45
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,840
and I could escape from
that endless, draining, monotonous life.

46
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,840
People there were bullying you.

47
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,200
So, you learned some peculiar
medical skills to protect yourself.

48
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,736
More or less.
You've seen the result anyway.

49
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,080
My own father made me a sacrifice,
and my own sister sees me as competition.

50
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,600
Right now, I just want to end all this.

51
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,040
Consider it a form of liberation.

52
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,080
Forget it. Even if I told you,
you wouldn't understand.

53
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:12,960
For the first time, I feel having
parents is worse than being orphaned.

54
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,760
Let me apply this on you.

55
00:05:27,396 --> 00:05:30,784
(Ling's Clinic)

56
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,160
How is it, still hurt?

57
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,280
This wound medicine is quite effective.

58
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,960
It is made by Yao.

59
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,360
He's like a father to me,
having watched me grow up.

60
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,400
Your injury is quite severe.

61
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,920
Even if you've applied medicine,
you should avoid getting wet.

62
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,600
You mentioned it before, I remember.

63
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,760
So, what kind of spell
did we end up having?

64
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,880
I came this time
to get a clear answer about this.

65
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,360
Come out. Stop eavesdropping.

66
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,200
So, it seems like
you've formed a symbiotic relationship.

67
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,560
A symbiotic relationship?
Then, is there a way to terminate it?

68
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,016
I saw it in a secret martial arts manual
many years ago.

69
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,720
As for which book it was,
I need to think.

70
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,720
You'll have to give me some time.

71
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,160
Don't make it hard for him.

72
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,320
To find out the truth, the person
who tied the bell must untie it.

73
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,480
Relax, I will find a solution soon.

74
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,280
I'll let you live the life you desire.

75
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,560
Fine, since you've said so.

76
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,080
Then, before the problem is resolved,

77
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,160
I'll also try to
help you complete your matters.

78
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,520
Just consider it repaying your favor.

79
00:08:45,376 --> 00:08:46,528
Let's go.

80
00:08:46,528 --> 00:08:47,616
Okay.

81
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,520
Ling Xinghe, you didn't say
we'd start by catching chickens.

82
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,080
How am I supposed to make this soup?

83
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,080
Lady Liuyan, it's getting late.
Hurry up and get on the carriage.

84
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,200
Remember to send me a message
if there's any news.

85
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,600
Okay.

86
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,720
I thought he stole some small things.
Turns out he stole valuable items.

87
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,300
(Records of Creatures from Mountains and Seas)
My lord, just as you expected,

88
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,320
I found this ancient book
at Ling's Clinic.

89
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,800
The book mentions the snow lotus.

90
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,880
But when I got hold of the book,

91
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,240
the page recording the location
of the snow lotus had been torn out.

92
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,760
Only a line saying "leaves falling
beside the house in disarray".

93
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,720
"The moon casts shadows
on the grass of both sides."

94
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,512
This is the secret book
of the Dusk Clan.

95
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:10,400
Only the members of their clan
understand the meaning within the book.

96
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,568
Prime Minister, another thing
has been confirmed.

97
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,080
Lady Chunri and her partner haven't
established a symbiotic relationship.

98
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,320
It seems that the initial information
was correct.

99
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,760
This symbiotic relationship requires
one's closest kin to form.

100
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,040
Ling's Clinic, and the Dusk Clan.

101
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,680
(Strange Creatures
of Mountains and Seas: Snow Lotus)

102
00:10:54,564 --> 00:10:57,160
(What exactly is wound medicine?)

103
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,560
(Wu Jifeng as Ling Xinghe)
Wound medicine,

104
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,760
also known as sealing wound medicine,

105
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,560
commonly called blade edge medicine.

106
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,840
It is a traditional
Chinese herbal medicine.

107
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,280
It seems to be a miraculous medicine
that every martial arts master carries.

108
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,240
No matter how serious the wound is,

109
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,320
applying wound medicine
will ensure a full recovery given time.

110
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,520
Interestingly, one of the ingredients
in wound medicine was dragon bone.

111
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:21,800
But, the "dragon bone" doesn't refer to
the bones of the mythical dragons.

112
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,240
It's the fossilized bones
of large mammals from ancient times,

113
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,680
such as fossils
of elephants, rhinoceroses, and deer.

114
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,800
Animal fossils are not easy to get.

115
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,000
After being considered
a main ingredient,

116
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,720
its price also began to surge.

117
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,440
Among the cheaper medicinal materials,

118
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,120
there are mugwort, agrimonia pilosa,
carbonized hair, and notoginseng.

119
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,560
So, the expensive wound medicine
gradually went off the market.
