00:01:14,564 --> 00:01:17,728
=Dr. Spring=

2
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,960
(We've searched this place thoroughly.)

3
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,720
(What else can we do?)

4
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,960
(Should I ask her?)

5
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,080
(There might be some clues.)

6
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,120
(Is he waiting for me?)

7
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:50,848
=Episode 13=

8
00:02:14,752 --> 00:02:15,808
My lady.

9
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,820
Mr. Ji, you come to see me?

10
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,676
Yes.

11
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:26,260
Are you here to plead for them?

12
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,460
Not really.

13
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,780
Without them, it's quieter.

14
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:41,060
You want to eat the snacks?

15
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:45,180
(If you like it, just tell me.)

16
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,820
Maybe next time I'm in a good mood,
I'll make some for you.

17
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,500
Yeah, kind of.

18
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,220
I get it now.

19
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,260
But the grandmother is still ill.

20
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,220
We should wait until she feels better.

21
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,220
I'll make some for you then.

22
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:45,260
My lady,
you're really thoughtful and kind.

23
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,380
Mr. Ji, you know me well.

24
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:53,420
But I'm still a bit childish.

25
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,636
Does it look good?

26
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,580
Is that why you caused Chunri trouble?

27
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:11,020
I didn't mean to target her.

28
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,140
It's just that
my dad used to dote on me.

29
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,140
But ever since she came here,

30
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:19,820
he's been fond of her. Why?

31
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,780
If your dad had been fond of her,

32
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:24,660
he wouldn't have refused to see her
while he stayed here for days.

33
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,180
But he ordered that no one harm her.

34
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,220
Even I have never been treated that way.

35
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,020
When I was little,
I was having fun one day.

36
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:36,380
I ran into a strange place
and then got beaten up.

37
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,300
A strange place?

38
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,900
Yes, a very strange place.

39
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,020
- At that time...
- My lady.

40
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,220
The Elder Madam has woken up.

41
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,500
I'll go see grandmother first.
We can talk later.

42
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,332
My lady.

43
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:00,140
I'll make you snacks for sure.

44
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:07,820
And, Mr. Ji, thanks for letting me share
my childhood memories.

45
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,780
We both have siblings.

46
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,820
So I've had them released.

47
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,460
A strange place?

48
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,980
At that time, my sedan chair stopped...

49
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,788
Right here.

50
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,180
How do you know?

51
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,260
We're about to cross the bridge.
Do not look back.

52
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,900
We're about to cross the bridge.
Do not look back.

53
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,100
You are the captain of the escorts?

54
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,700
So you've had your eye on me since then.

55
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,940
My gosh, Ling Xinghe.

56
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,820
Why aren't you talking?

57
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,300
Let's get down to business.

58
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,820
From which direction
were the petals blown?

59
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,740
This direction. I remember it clearly.

60
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,700
Mr. Yu's left cervical spine
had a vascular blockage.

61
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,380
So he could only turn to the left.

62
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,980
He came around to my right at the time.

63
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,860
The petals were drifting
from the left side.

64
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:20,100
But I clearly remember
it was a southeast wind that day.

65
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:25,620
But I'm sure the petals
were blown from this side.

66
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,900
This tree was right
in front of this building.

67
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,660
But now it's on our northwest side.

68
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,220
Then now we...?

69
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,580
The house moved.

70
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,740
But this is an entire house.

71
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,300
How could it possibly move overnight?

72
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,020
I clearly remember

73
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,660
the trunk I saw that day
was growing in this direction.

74
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,860
Different from now.

75
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,980
Because these branches resemble

76
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,460
a special kind of blood vessels.

77
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,540
So the tree is reversed now?

78
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,380
Trees cannot be moved.

79
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:09,780
So even if it's impossible,
there's only one situation left.

80
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,620
They switched
the entire direction of the courtyard.

81
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,500
Perhaps they were already prepared
when it was built.

82
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,050
(Night)
At night, the house and the entrance

83
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,180
(South)
are both on the south side.

84
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,420
By day, through the changing of gears,

85
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,780
the direction of the house changes.

86
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,500
The entrance moves
from the south side to the north side,

87
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,540
thereby confusing us.

88
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,500
But however they make the mechanism,

89
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,580
the direction of the tree
cannot be changed.

90
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,500
This is the crucial point.

91
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,900
So when I investigated last time,

92
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:44,700
I shouldn't have gone from the right,
but from the left.

93
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,380
There's no difference.

94
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,500
That's how it's done in TV dramas.

95
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:29,892
TV dramas?

96
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,580
Never mind. Let's go.

97
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:53,620
The smell of rotten apples.
Could it be...?

98
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,500
We're late again.

99
00:09:14,852 --> 00:09:18,180
(Records of Creatures
from Mountains and Seas.)

100
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,756
Records of Creatures
from Mountains and Seas.

101
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:28,460
They've just left.
We can still catch up.

102
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,916
Go!

103
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,380
How dare you! You shouldn't be here!

104
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,100
It seems we have to break out.

105
00:09:45,412 --> 00:09:46,460
You...

106
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,220
She knows too much.
Kill her when we have the chance.

107
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:52,060
If our identities are exposed,
then it's all over.

108
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,820
Dude, grinding these instance zones
has been tough.

109
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,780
I think I still have some value.

110
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:03,860
You're wrong. Only when she's here,
will Prime Minister Li not run.

111
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,380
You really plan to marry her?

112
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,420
I'll tell you the details
when we get back.

113
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,500
She can't die now.

114
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,020
You know the rules of Lingxue Pavilion.

115
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,540
If you stick to it,

116
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,220
I never want to see you again.

117
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,700
Just ignore him.

118
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:35,780
But you really could take me hostage.

119
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:48,340
I'll take you out for some air.

120
00:10:54,344 --> 00:10:56,820
(Why do severe diabetics
have a rotten apple smell?)

121
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,940
(Xu Ziyin as Li Chunri)
Severe diabetics usually have an odor.

122
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,740
Similar to the smell of rotten apples.

123
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,460
This is usually due to
a severe lack of insulin.

124
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:08,660
It causes the body to be unable
to utilize glucose for energy.

125
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:11,660
When glucose in the body
cannot provide energy,

126
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:15,540
it usually uses proteins and
other non-carbohydrate substances.

127
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,900
If the fats are not completely oxidized,

128
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,140
when the body needs energy,

129
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,580
substances like pyruvic acid
typically appear.

130
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:25,060
When it spreads into the blood,

131
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,780
they are emitted through sweat or urine.

132
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:31,140
Therefore, severe diabetics give off
a smell similar to rotten apples.
