18

Unbutton your shirt.

19
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,404
It might be a bit cold.

20
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,316
It's okay.

21
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:08,220
(Weird. I feel
I saw him somewhere before.)

22
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:26,140
Done. It's not serious.

23
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,452

that the innocent must not be harmed.

in that litter.

63

64

but Li suddenly brought her back.

65
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,060
He must have something to hide.

that in the world of this game,)

(It's said no one has seen the true face
of its leader.)

74

(Externally, it's Ji Bieqing,
head of the Wugou Section.)

the best killer of Lingxue Pavilion.)

in his house.

80

86
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,620
We're about to cross the bridge.
Do not look back.

87
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:11,820

Please tie your hair and change clothes
to welcome the sacrifice.

93
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:14,716
Congratulations, Prime Minister.
Once you complete the symbiosis

94
00:10:14,716 --> 00:10:17,660
and transfer your disease
to make you immortal,

95
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,700
the world will be at our...

96
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:29,740
Prime Minister, don't you wish
to be immortal to rule over the world?

97
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:35,548
(Prime Minister Li)

98
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,900
Oh my, what place is this?

99
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,004
I'm Yu Youde, the house steward.

100
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,700
I'm here to welcome you back.

101
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:09,460
It was so bumpy sitting in this litter.

102
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:13,260
As the Prime Minister's daughter,
why did I enter through the side gate?

103
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:17,460
Only lineal daughters can enter
through the main gate.

104
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:21,300
So I'm a natural daughter
who can only go through a side gate.

105
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,460
Miss Li, please get on the sedan chair.

106
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,700
(He can't turn his neck to the right?)

107
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,060
(Clearly, he has a bad cervical spine.)

108
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,820
(Who am I to worry about others?
What bad luck.)

109
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,700
Sir.

110
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:35,740
It's time. Have you cleaned the offering
to ward off evil spirits?

111
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,852
(Ward off evil spirits? Offering?)

112
00:12:37,852 --> 00:12:38,860
We're done.

113
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,780
What are you waiting for? Get started.

114
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,660
(What did he inject me with?)

115
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,220
Sir, it's done.

116
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:12,020
All of you, leave.
Remember, within half an hour,

117
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,060
she can't contact with anyone.

118
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,340
Otherwise, we'll have to wait for
the next alignment of the sun and stars.

119
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,380
Yes.

120
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,540
What did they do to me?

121
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,180
(Turns out I'm the sacrifice
in this game.)

122
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,100
(No, I have to leave right now.)

123
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,420
(My head is killing me.)

124
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:03,860
(Players must either fully complete
or abort their game life before exiting.)

125
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,020
(This game isn't fun at all.)

126
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:10,180
(I might as well die and get back.)

127
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,980
It's you.

128
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,660
Are you a player too?

129
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,820
Is your profession a killer?

130
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,188
Then do you have a knife?

131
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,660
What for?

132
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,540
Kill me right now.

133
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,980
This is the carotid artery. Thanks.

134
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,900
You can't die
before I find Prime Minister Li.

135
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,540
You're really getting into character.

136
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,220
But I can't stay
in this place any longer.

137
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,420
Can you lend me your knife?

138
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,020
How did you get injured?

139
00:16:08,412 --> 00:16:11,120
(What is auscultation? How to auscultate
without a stethoscope?)

140
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,960
(Xu Ziyin as Li Chunri)
Auscultation typically refers to

141
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,500
using tools such as a stethoscope

142
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,940
to listen to the internal sounds
of a patient's body

143
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:20,060
to gain information
about diseases and physical conditions.

144
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,900
Before the invention of the stethoscope,

145
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,660
doctors often had to press close
to the patient's body,

146
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,420
placing their ear
on the patient's chest or back.

147
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,940
But it was offensive to women.

148
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,740
Thus, in 1816,

149
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,140
a French doctor,
while auscultating a noble lady,

150
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:39,060
thought of using the rolled-up paper
to listen to the heart sounds.

151
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:42,340
Later, this doctor
made a hollow wooden tube,

152
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,780
30 centimeters long
with a diameter of 0.5 centimeters.

153
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:48,820
For portability, he split the tube
into two parts

154
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:51,660
with threads to be screwed together.

155
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:55,140
This flute-like device was accepted
by many doctors.

156
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,620
After continuous optimization,

157
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:59,020
the monaural stethoscope was created.
From then on,

158
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:03,260
women could be auscultated
without physical contact.
