00:01:15,236 --> 00:01:17,760
=Dr. Spring=

2
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,300
So the days
of being a rich lady are over?

3
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:31,580
Were your days in there rich?

4
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,380
Shut up!

5
00:01:39,464 --> 00:01:40,980
=Episode 14=

6
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:44,780
The book says that the snow lotuses
will form a symbiosis

7
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,100
only if these two people
are close relatives.

8
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,620
Are you my...?

9
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,300
Nonsense. There's absolutely no way

10
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,900
I'm related to your family.

11
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,780
Then why this book...?

12
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,900
We'll know all the answers
once we find snow lotuses.

13
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,420
But the book only mentions
that it can form a symbiosis.

14
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,100
It doesn't say how to untie it though.

15
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,620
There must be an antidote
around a snake's den.

16
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:18,100
But the world is so vast,
where do we go to find a snake's den?

17
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,420
Leaves dance in disarray
beside the household.

18
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,460
The moon casts
shadows of grass on both banks.

19
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,500
What does that mean?

20
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,380
Gourd Mountain.

21
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:56,460
I didn't expect them
to have some real skills.

22
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:00,780
They actually managed
to locate the medicinal pool.

23
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:06,300
But as always, Prime Minister,
you're one step ahead.

24
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:12,300
I hope they won't disappoint us.

25
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,900
Things will go as you wish for sure.

26
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,420
Because the two mountains
are of different heights,

27
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:25,180
the people living on them
can see dusk twice every day.

28
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,900
Hence, outsiders call them
the Dusk Clan.

29
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:34,660
The Dusk Clan? What a beautiful name.

30
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,260
They are all your kin?

31
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:48,060
But that year,
no one from the clan except me

32
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,500
could witness the second dusk.

33
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,900
Is it because of Li?

34
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,700
I joined the Lingxue Pavilion
to uncover the truth.

35
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,580
Now I probably know the answer.

36
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,820
But Li has fled now.

37
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,580
He definitely won't get back.

38
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,700
Where do we go to find him then?

39
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,140
As long as you're here,
he'll come looking for us.

40
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,780
If we find him, let me help you.

41
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,900
After all, killing such evil people
isn't a crime in this world.

42
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,260
As long as you're by my side,

43
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,580
it's the greatest help to me.

44
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,020
Let's go.

45
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:18,140
Just remember,
a worthless piece can be discarded.

46
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:33,284
At this point, I have but one request.

47
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:34,948
Say it.

48
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,260
I've worked with him for a long time...

49
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:41,060
Do you want to plead for him?

50
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:46,300
No, I know Ling Xinghe well.

51
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,180
I want another order.

52
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,500
I'll put an end to Ling Xinghe myself.

53
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:56,580
There's no need
to trouble others in the pavilion.

54
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,252
I shall...

55
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,140
I shall take my leave.

56
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,940
(How dare she!)

57
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:20,860
(She embroidered a butt on my mask.)

58
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,372
Don't move.

59
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,180
There's no snow lotus here. Let's leave.

60
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:57,780
Are you sure? Who are these people?

61
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,260
The medicinal pool in Li's residence
is cold and damp.

62
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,220
But the ink in this book
is clear and dry.

63
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,620
It seems that before we got it,

64
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,220
it had been carefully preserved.

65
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,100
It couldn't have been
left there carelessly.

66
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:13,060
So it's obvious
that someone deliberately left it here.

67
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,460
So they are all people of Li,
and they've been following us.

68
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:22,180
You taking me out
was just a smokescreen.

69
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,660
You knew where the snow lotus was.

70
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:28,740
I don't know, but Yao knows. Let's go.

71
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:44,420
Let me see if you're seriously injured.

72
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,260
So you asking me to follow you

73
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,980
was to prevent this kind of situation.

74
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,620
I'll definitely protect you.

75
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,260
(Prime Minister's Residence)

76
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,660
Mother, you must
have treated them badly.

77
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,780
They thought they caused trouble
and ran away.

78
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,380
How could that be possible?

79
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:10,180
I just have a loud voice.
I'm just a bit bad-tempered.

80
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,900
Now that my grandmother has woken up,

81
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,380
I'll go find them.

82
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:17,020
I know who you are going after.

83
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,540
You silly girl.

84
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,260
Are you going to leave your mother
just for a man?

85
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,860
This time it's different.

86
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,340
Others are interested in
the power of our family.

87
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:29,740
But he's different. He listened to me.

88
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,540
He cared about my childhood.

89
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,380
He praised the snacks I had made.

90
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:41,020
He left me this rabbit
under the pear tree.

91
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,540
He's a good person to live life with.

92
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:54,380
Yan, you're too naive.

93
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,420
It's all because
you've been overly protected.

94
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,540
Anyway, I don't want to endure
what you've experienced.

95
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,740
You followed the family's arrangements
to marry into this wealthy family,

96
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,780
but spent a lifetime alone
in an empty room.

97
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:20,020
All right, if you don't experience it,

98
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,940
you'll never grow up in this lifetime.

99
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:28,380
Since you're determined to go,
I shall not say much.

100
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:33,180
It's just that from now on
you'll have to rely on yourself.

101
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,940
There's not much I can prepare for you.

102
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,980
Just some items for emergencies.

103
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,860
(This is too much.)

104
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,540
Mother.

105
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,780
Yan.

106
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,780
Mother.

107
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:53,900
Yan.

108
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,180
Mother, I can't bear to leave you.

109
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,540
Yan, you stepped on my foot.

110
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:05,500
(How to quickly stop bleeding
after your arm is cut?)

111
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:09,860
(Wu Jifeng as Ling Xinghe)
Raise the arm to at least heart level,

112
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,620
to reduce bleeding.

113
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:15,380
Next, use a disinfected gauze or bandage

114
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,180
to gently cover the bleeding area.

115
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,492
Do not apply too much pressure
to prevent more bleeding.

116
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,300
Then use a clean bandage,
gauze, or handkerchief

117
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,100
to press the bleeding area
gently but firmly.

118
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,660
If the bandage or gauze is saturated,
do not replace it.

119
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,140
Instead, continue to cover it
with another layer on top.

120
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:35,020
Continue to apply pressure
until the bleeding stops.

121
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:38,180
If the bleeding cannot be stopped
by direct pressure,

122
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:42,180
wrap a bandage or strap
above the bleeding area

123
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:46,300
away from the heart, then gradually
tighten the bandage or strap.

124
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,180
But do not tie it too tightly

125
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,780
to avoid cutting off
the blood supply to the arm.

126
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:53,900
Finally, secure it with a knot.
