(Prime Minister's Residence)

3
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,220
My-My lady, why are here?

4
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,540
Release my people.

5
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,740
Without your sister's order, I...

6
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:33,980
Release my people!

7
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:37,060
It's the Prime Minister's order.
Ask him if you don't believe me.

8
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,460
My lady, I really can't.

9
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,660
Get out of my way.

10
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,300
My lady, you...

11
00:01:47,072 --> 00:01:50,620
=Episode 6=

12
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,980
It's just 100 meters away.

13
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:58,220
You made me detour around the house.

14
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:02,740
I asked for navigation,
but you're acting like a tour guide.

15
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,660
Sorry for the suffering.

16
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,700
Aren't you usually quite tough
when dealing with me?

17
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,580
How come you can't handle this one?

18
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,980
I am now a powerless physician.

19
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,620
If we don't want to be exposed,
we can only kill them.

20
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,700
But how's this any different
from Prime Minister Li?

21
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,380
Let's not talk about it now.
Hurry up and leave here.

22
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,260
Who told you to leave?

23
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,580
How did you get hurt like this?

24
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:42,700
My lady, you don't need to
worry about my injuries.

25
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:47,460
Please show mercy and let me
return to the clinic for treatment.

26
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,500
Wh-Who hurt you?

27
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,540
It's all because of you.

28
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:58,260
Li Chunri, the man you brought back

29
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,660
saw my naked body.

30
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,980
You must give me an explanation today.

31
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,980
You saw her body?

32
00:03:08,864 --> 00:03:10,240
Well, I understand.

33
00:03:11,228 --> 00:03:16,180
Rejected by the husband-to-be,
you're indeed pitiful.

34
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,420
Having met a true lady of noble birth,

35
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,860
how could he like a rustic girl
from the countryside?

36
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,220
Whatever you say.

37
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,300
I really don't have time
for this. I must go.

38
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,500
Who allowed you to leave?

39
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,564
Are you going to stab me?

40
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:42,180
Fine, here, aim here and stab.

41
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,804
Come on! Stab me if you dare!

42
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,140
Li Liuyan, have you
thought this through?

43
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,660
If you hurt me today,

44
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,220
how will you explain it to Father?

45
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,340
Why wouldn't I?

46
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,764
Attack her. Attack!

47
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:01,700
My lady, the house steward
did say not to hurt her.

48
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,140
You are useless!

49
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,676
Watch out!

50
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,860
This matter started because of me.
Come to me if there's any problem.

51
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,060
My lady, I'll go back to
the clinic for treatment.

52
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,140
My lady, are you alright?

53
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,300
Just a son-in-law,
how dare he lay hands on your people!

54
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:40,980
But he did that to save me.

55
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,900
B-But he left with another woman.

56
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:47,020
Is it because I'm too aloof?
He feels he doesn't deserve me.

57
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,740
No way. I need to lower my stance a bit.

58
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,420
Prepare the carriage. I must catch him.

59
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,780
My lady!

60
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,380
Why put yourself through this?

61
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,780
You owe me this.

62
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,180
I'll find a way to end the symbiosis
as soon as possible.

(Yao Xiyang,

66
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,260
I'll go and take a look.

67
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,700
(That's the assassin I ordered
from the black market a few days ago.)

68
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,780
(I thought he was a swindler.)

69
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,220
It's you again.

70
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,700
Mr. Ling, why so nervous?

71
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,020
Is it because
the mission isn't going well?

72
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,740
The Yinlong Guards
always operate secretly.

73
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,780
I don't need to report my plan
to Wugou Section.

74
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,100
(Yinlong Guard? Wugou Section?)

75
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,260
And I'll never let you live.

76
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,500
Then why don't we have a closure today?

77
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,780
Lest you ruin the reputation
of Lingxue Pavilion by lingering there.

78
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,788
You're spying on me?

79
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,780
It's not that I want to spy on you.

80
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,620
(Ling's Clinic)
Just someone wants you dead.

81
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,020
No!

82
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,100
You're quite ruthless.

83
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,132
Still dare to kill me?

84
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,220
Using a woman as a shield?

85
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,460
I should be hearing the good news
of you completing the mission soon, right?

86
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,900
But this is the ultimatum.

87
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,780
If it drags on, I don't mind
taking matters into my own hands.

88
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,420
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

89
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:20,500
Let me see. Is it severe?

90
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,740
Let me have a look. Does it hurt?

(The History of Flogging)

92
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,860
(Zhou Yuhang as Yu Youde)
Flogging has existed

93
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,700
since the Yellow Emperor era.

94
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,180
It was mainly a punishment for slaves
during the feudal era.

95
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:40,180
Ancient flogging was all about torture.

96
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,820
The whips often had nails or hooks
to tear away the flesh.

97
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,580
And flogging was generally aimed at men.

98
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,740
Men would be stripped
to receive the punishment.

99
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:52,380
This directly contacts the skin,
increasing the punitive effect.

100
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:56,380
Flogging can lead to
trauma, bruising, ulcers,

101
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,380
and other physical injuries
such as bleeding.

102
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:02,172
It could even cause permanent physical
and psychological harm.

103
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,380
Flogging was completely abolished until
the time of People's Republic of China.
