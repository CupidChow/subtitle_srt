1
00:01:14,692 --> 00:01:17,824
=Dr. Spring=

2
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,140
Who are you talking about?

3
00:01:25,696 --> 00:01:27,460
=Episode 4=

4
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:28,580
Why are you here?

5
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,980
I know I'm just a humble physician

6
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,900
and not good enough for you.

7
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,796
But we've taken the mountains and rivers
as our witnesses and made a commitment.

8
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,420
Your promises to me still echo
in my ears.

9
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,340
Have you forgotten?

10
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,700
My lady, is that true?

11
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,100
(If I hadn't considered medical ethics,)

12
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,060
(I should have killed you last night.)

13
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,900
Since you're gonna leave me,

14
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,580
I can't live anymore.

15
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,260
How about you flog me 100 times,

16
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:22,940
slowly tormenting me to death?

17
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:40,980
He is indeed my betrothed.

18
00:02:51,068 --> 00:02:54,140
My lady, why didn't you say so earlier?

19
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,740
That's because I...

20
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:06,300
I am thin-skinned.

21
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,940
Can't you leave me alone?

22
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,300
Unless you let me enter the residence

23
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:38,060
and see your father.

24
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:49,700
You don't have to kneel.

25
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,780
Since the two of you
are so reluctant to part,

26
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,900
let's come in and discuss further.

27
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,060
Okay.

28
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,620
I wondered
why my eyes were blinded by dust.

29
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,380
(Li Liuyan, legitimate daughter of the Prime Minister)
Turns out a country bumpkin came.

30
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,020
My lady, this is Lady Chunri.

31
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,660
Mr. Yu, are you certain
she's my father's daughter?

32
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,340
Don't find the wrong one

33
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,860
who's just here to get free stuff.

34
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,588
The Prime Minister
has only one daughter.

35
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,140
A country girl can't
be Prime Minister's daughter.

36
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,900
But there are many lackeys
in this residence,

37
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:56,900
and you're the loudest one among them.

38
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,100
Even louder than your master.

39
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,180
Who are you insulting?

40
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,900
The one who spoke loudly.

41
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,396
- You...
- My lady.

42
00:05:02,396 --> 00:05:03,580
Please hear me out first.

43
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,660
I don't want to hear it.

44
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,300
Who are you?

45
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,660
He's Lady Chunri's boyfriend.

46
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,660
You look handsome.

47
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,860
What did you see in her?

48
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,940
She cannot compare to you,
a sack embroidered with golden threads.

49
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,700
What do you mean by that?

50
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,820
Looks good outside but empty inside.

51
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,236
Lady Chunri has just returned.
There are many things to settle.

52
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,836
How about...?

53
00:05:51,836 --> 00:05:54,780
How about I take care of it?
The residence is so big.

54
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,660
If you accidentally
enter a groom's room,

55
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,876
that will be quite improper.

56
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,500
My lady, what are you laughing at?

57
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,900
Isn't this how villains laugh?

58
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,100
This way, please.

59
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:24,300
Tell everyone
to take good care of Lady Chunri

60
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,900
and keep her safe.

61
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,980
Yes, sir.

62
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,700
There are many rules.

63
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,220
I'll only tell you once,
so listen carefully.

64
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,500
My mother lives in the main house.

65
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,260
(Current location: Madam Li's house)
She is noble and well-educated,

66
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,420
an elegant lady from a good family.

67
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,300
Outsiders can't bother her.

68
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,620
Do it harder. Men are useless.

69
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,860
I bet Master won't come back.

70
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,300
Your father is not home?

71
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,980
My father fell seriously ill a year ago
and has become severely emaciated.

72
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,540
His eyesight also failed,
so he moved out for convalescence.

73
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:19,196
There is another forbidden area,
my grandma's house.

74
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,860
(Current location: Li Liuyan's House)
No admittance without permission.

75
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,940
What's left is where I reside.

76
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,620
Let's not go into the thatched cottage.

77
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,740
You like thatched cottages, don't you?
Come with me.

78
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,180
Since you've brought it up yourself,

79
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,300
I suppose I'll have to grant your wish.

80
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,260
I'm afraid you'll miss the smells
of your hometown.

81
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:49,900
There's a firewood room there.
Choose for yourselves.

82
00:08:00,055 --> 00:08:01,605
(Current location:
Li Chunri's thatched cottage)

83
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,540
Oh, my.

84
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,428
Come on.
I'm the Prime Minister's daughter.

85
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,660
I live in such a dilapidated place?

86
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,260
What am I here for?

87
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,700
Why are you looking at me?

88
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,900
What's wrong with you?

89
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,900
This is a warning for your escape.

90
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,940
Don't push me. I...

91
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,420
You...

92
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,340
You crazy woman.

93
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,500
You domestic abuser.

94
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,780
If you move again, I will cut your face.

95
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,788
You...

96
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:50,180
If you do that, I'll hang myself.
I'll strangle you.

97
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:54,100
Strangle me? Fine, if you strangle me,

98
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:59,140
I'll cut your hands and feet first,

99
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,580
making you envy the dead.

100
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,100
I will expose your identity
as an assassin.

101
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,340
If I'm dead, what's the point
of exposing my identity?

102
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,460
- I...
- Go ahead.

103
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,860
You think of a way
to dissolve the relationship between us.

104
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,900
We need to find the man behind this.

105
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,780
Agreed. Let's call it a truce.

106
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:34,940
Listen, I'm not a crazy woman.
My name is Li Chunri.

107
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,812
Ling Xinghe.

108
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,884
Hurry down.

109
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,020
I didn't do it on purpose.

110
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,740
Help.

111
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,940
If you behave and stay out of trouble,

112
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,260
I'll protect you.

113
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:34,340
And I never bring others into trouble.

114
00:11:41,084 --> 00:11:42,044
(Red-Head Crane Poison)

115
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:46,100
Red-Head Crane Poison?
Such a direct approach.

116
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,660
You're skilled in medicine.
You know how to use this.

117
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,980
Where are you going?

118
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,932
To kill someone.

119
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,900
If you get caught,
I'll eat it immediately.

120
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:10,940
You're so arrogant.

121
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:14,420
You think you're Ji Bieqing,
the top assassin of Lingxue Pavilion?

122
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,740
He's nothing.

123
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:23,740
Prime Minister,
Lady Chunri has returned.

124
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:29,900
Since she's here, treat her well.

125
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,380
Yes, understood.

126
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:36,900
But a man came with her.

127
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,900
I haven't found out his background.

128
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,660
Just as one assassin fled,
her boyfriend appeared.

129
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,100
Moreover, the two of them acted strange.

130
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:51,020
I think
it might be related to symbiosis.

131
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:56,700
Are you suggesting that I have a son?

132
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,900
No, that's not what I mean.

133
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,700
You figure it out as soon as possible.

134
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:04,500
Keep an eye on her in secret
and don't alert her before success.

135
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:10,700
And before the next
Sun and Star Conjunction,

136
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,820
find a new snow lotus.

137
00:13:17,344 --> 00:13:19,612
(Current location: Crescent-Shaped Hall)

138
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,020
(How did the entrance vanish?)

139
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,260
(Solid.)

140
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,140
(I remember
I followed in through this door.)

141
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,460
(Something fishy is going on here.)

142
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,060
(I have to search the entire residence.)

143
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,540
Has house steward Yu left?

144
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:14,620
You go and get the stuff
Li Si got out of the river.

145
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:17,580
My lady, what do you want
with those dirty things?

146
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,820
I can't let that country bumpkin
go hungry,

147
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,060
right?

148
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,692
Rotate.

149
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,780
You throw mud at me.

150
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:03,540
I'll plant flowers in the mud.

151
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,140
I'll have a taste of this.

152
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,180
It tastes so sweet.

153
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,540
Sir, are we going up or not?

154
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,252
Let's wait and see.

155
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,830
((Current location: Li Liuyan's House))
(I've searched most of the mansion,)

156
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,060
(but I couldn't find the medicine pool.)

157
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,340
(Could it be...?)

158
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:32,940
Cheers.

159
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:47,580
Li Chunri, you crazy woman.

160
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,020
Who are you? Somebody!

161
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:04,500
(Connection between the Red-Head Crane
Poison and the red-crowned crane?)

162
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,420
(Wu Jifeng as Ling Xinghe)
Red-Head Crane Poison is the most deadly poison in ancient times.

163
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:11,708
It contains impure arsenic trioxide,
commonly known as arsenic.

164
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:15,068
It's red, also called red alum
and red arsenic, highly toxic.

165
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:18,740
The arsenic produced
in ancient times was impure,

166
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,420
so the arsenic as a whole looked red.

167
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:25,220
This red color is similar to that
on the crown of the red-crowned crane.

168
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:28,060
Thus, the ancients linked the two types
of red together

169
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:32,940
and gave arsenic a subtle
and poetic name, Red-Head Crane Poison.
