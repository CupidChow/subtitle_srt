00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,256
(Yichun House)

3
00:01:20,256 --> 00:01:23,044
=Episode 16=

4
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,000
Come on in!

5
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,340
Mr. Li, you've arrived.

6
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,540
Hong, Cui, take care of the guests!

7
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,740
Mr. Wang, please come inside!

8
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,100
Oh dear, quick!

9
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,780
Please come inside! Have a seat!

10
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,460
This way!

11
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,540
Is this place private?

12
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,300
This place is full of secrets.

13
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,700
They would never know

14
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,260
that we two girls
would come to a place like this.

15
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:06,060
Hi, sir! You're new here, aren't you?

16
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,420
Are you here to drink or to stay today?

17
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,740
Prepare the fine wine and dishes for me.

18
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:15,220
We want to book the entire house today.

19
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:20,060
The entire house? Oh, sir...

20
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:23,140
It's really difficult to manage.

21
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,660
Is it manageable now?

22
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,940
Now it must be managed!

23
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,700
I'm blind as a bat!

24
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,940
Choose whatever you want!

25
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:42,020
We're most famous for themed rooms.

26
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:45,540
We have "Lovely Maids" and
"Love in a Fallen City".

27
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,020
"A Charming Scholar
and His Perfect Match".

28
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,460
"A Bossy Princess Being Tender".

29
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,860
Sir, which room do you prefer?

30
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:55,860
A Bossy...

31
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,260
Don't you have any normal rooms here?

32
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:04,500
Normal rooms? There are
two superior rooms on the second floor.

33
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,340
But there are four of you.

34
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:11,260
For them, what's done is done.

35
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:16,540
I'll just have to
stay in the same room with Mr. Ji.

36
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,820
Awesome! I'll prepare one for you two.

37
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,620
How about "The Cold-faced Assassin
with a Burning Passion"?

38
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,740
You two...

39
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,100
We'll go to another room.

40
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,380
I'd like to have cold noodles.

41
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,940
So a room can actually be this small.

42
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:52,620
This bed is too hard.
It's not as good as my bed.

43
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,820
Lady Liuyan,
you don't have to come with us.

44
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,220
I'm not a lady
in Prime Minister's Residence anymore.

45
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,620
Don't be stressed out.

46
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,580
(If it weren't for me,
she wouldn't be homeless.)

47
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,100
Can you be a little gentler?

48
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,940
It's fine. It doesn't hurt.

49
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,740
This is how we did it before, right?

50
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,020
Why doesn't it work this time?

51
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:28,260
It shouldn't be like this.
How come it's not working?

52
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,620
Something went wrong?

53
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,340
Maybe some blood?

54
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,660
But we did it last time.

55
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,740
Last time?

56
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,620
It must be that time
when my mom took me there.

57
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,900
Last time and this time.
How can they be the same?

58
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,820
Why don't we try again?

59
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:55,860
Try again?

60
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:56,900
Okay.

61
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,740
Then I'll be gentler, okay?

62
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,420
It's okay, harder.

63
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,020
How come it's not working this time?

64
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,020
I don't know whose problem it is.

65
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,820
I've practiced martial arts since young.
So it's definitely not my problem.

66
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,860
I study medicine.
I take good care of my body.

67
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,700
It can't be my problem.

68
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,780
Besides, this is your thing.

69
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,860
It must be your problem.

70
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,380
Well, this is not something
I can handle alone.

71
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,700
Why are you talking so loud?

72
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,940
I'm just being anxious.

73
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,540
What are they doing?

74
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:02,140
If you don't kill me,
how will you explain it to them?

75
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,340
Anyway, I won't be like you.

76
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:24,380
Do you want to work with me for once?

77
00:07:32,584 --> 00:07:35,020
(Cuts and Scratches: Self-Healing
or Medication?)

78
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:38,260
(Wu Jifeng as Ling Xinghe)
The body can usually heal itself.

79
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,340
Because the skin has
certain self-healing abilities.

80
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:44,620
The first priority after injury is
to keep the wound clean.

81
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:47,180
Avoid using too strong a disinfectant.

82
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:50,020
If there is minor bleeding,
you can use a clean gauze

83
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:53,300
or tissue to gently press the wound
to help stop the bleeding.

84
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,460
Secondly, keep the wound dry and clean

85
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,340
to reduce the risk of infection.

86
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:02,260
Avoid friction, strain,
or further damage to the wound

87
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,660
to promote healing.

88
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,140
You can also use a wound dressing
or a breathable Band-Aid

89
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,780
to gently cover the wound

90
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,860
to protect it from bacteria and dust.

91
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,020
Finally, remember to check
the healing of the wound regularly.

92
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:19,780
If the wound shows signs of infection
or it doesn't seem to heal,

93
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,980
then go to see a doctor right away.
