2
00:01:18,272 --> 00:01:20,768
(Yichun House)

3
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,340
Have some more.

4
00:01:33,412 --> 00:01:37,380
=Episode 17=

5
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,620
Didn't sleep all night, huh?

6
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,860
The floor is very hard.

7
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:46,700
Not like Mr. Ling,
who slept so softly, so soundly.

8
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,260
The floor in my room is hard as well.

9
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,780
How come you don't have dark circles?

10
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,100
I just don't have them.

11
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,980
Come on, quick, eat your breakfast.

12
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,420
Sister, sorry for
your suffering last night.

13
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,012
Too bad I haven't made much progress.

14
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,828
Lady Liuyan, there's
an interesting market nearby.

15
00:02:37,828 --> 00:02:39,300
- I was thinking if you...
- Yes!

16
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:47,020
I'm a bit busy, I'll think about it.

17
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,940
How about considering
while getting dressed?

18
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,020
Okay!

19
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,620
Are you sure about this?

20
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,180
We can't keep being so passive anymore.

21
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,444
You guys eat quickly too.

22
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,020
Where will those two go?

23
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,740
Hope he doesn't regret it.

24
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,780
What about the snow lotus then?

25
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,620
The water's been poured
and the soil's been loosened.

26
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,260
What more can we do?
Giving it an IV drip?

27
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,260
Should we start looking for Yao
following the clues?

28
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,420
But there're too many eyes outside.

29
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,884
You stay here. Wait for me to come back.

30
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,548
Alright.

31
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:59,351
(Yichun House)

32
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,740
We're going to the streets,
not the court.

33
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,060
Does it not look good?
Then I'll go change.

34
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,124
Wait.

35
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:23,780
It looks pretty.

36
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,380
(Just say if you want to hold hands.)

37
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,140
(Showy enough,
Li should notice her very soon.)

38
00:04:33,668 --> 00:04:34,756
Let's go.

39
00:04:34,756 --> 00:04:35,780
Okay.

40
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,620
You're back, still know your way home?

41
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,300
Did you bring me
some good wine and meat?

42
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,260
I brought you this, what do you say?

43
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,276
Who do you think you're fobbing off
with this piece of junk?

44
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,940
You don't even recognize your own stuff?

45
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,100
I don't know it.

46
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,420
Playing dumb?

47
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,668
Fine, then you won't
see your daughter-in-law.

48
00:06:01,668 --> 00:06:02,900
Where is she?

49
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,780
Don't bother looking. She didn't come.

50
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:10,140
How many years has it been?

51
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,740
I've been hoping
you'd bring me a daughter-in-law.

52
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,260
To let me have a look.

53
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,940
Now she isn't here.
I think you're lying to me.

54
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,940
Old man, I really don't have much time.

55
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,900
You know this thing
is called a snow lotus.

56
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,500
But you never tell me anything about it.

57
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,660
I am a killer.
I'm not even afraid of death.

58
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,700
But now I dare not
take the slightest risk.

59
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:46,540
Because, even if I suffer a superficial
wound, she is the one who suffers.

60
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:00,660
I didn't expect it,
but we still come to this.

61
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,460
- Grandpa.
- Yeah?

62
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,700
Here's your tea.

63
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,900
Thank you, honey.

64
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,620
How come there's a child here?

65
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,060
Good job!

66
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,580
Right in the bullseye, everyone,
right in the bullseye.

67
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,100
Everyone, there are
prizes for hitting the target.

68
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,700
Another bullseye, folks, another one.

69
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,700
Wow, three times in a row, jackpot!

70
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,260
Lady, come over here to claim your prize
and choose a gift.

71
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,260
Go on.

72
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,300
See which gift you want.

73
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:56,964
Which one?

74
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,940
This one?
How did you know I wanted this?

75
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,980
Then I'll take this one.

76
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,340
This little rabbit? Okay.

77
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,460
It's a little rabbit.

78
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,020
Come this way, please.

79
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,820
This lady hit three times in a row
and won the jackpot.

80
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,100
Congratulations, my lady.

81
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,860
Woo, congratulations!

82
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:26,100
It is said, "one arrow wins
the championship and gains great fame."

83
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,940
"Wrapped in rosy clouds,
veiling the sky."

84
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,500
You're very lucky, my lady.

85
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,220
So lucky.

86
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,260
Isn't the lady from the brothel?

87
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,060
- Brothel lady?
- Yeah.

88
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,300
What's the story? Tell us.

89
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,460
How dare you! I'm not a brothel lady.

90
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,460
I saw you coming out of there
with my own eyes.

91
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,660
So good-looking,
definitely the top courtesan.

92
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,780
Which family's girl
would degrade herself like that?

93
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,340
How about we all do you a favor, huh?

94
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,980
If you give me the rabbit,
I will keep you company.

95
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:56,996
Yeah.

96
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,620
Don't talk nonsense.
My husband is right here.

97
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,700
Watch it, or he'll skin you!

98
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,724
Oh, husband?

99
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:06,100
Well, where is he?
Huh, where's this man?

100
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,100
Oh, I know, me, it's me.

101
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,100
Name your price.
I'll keep you company today.

102
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,860
Yeah.

103
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,140
Any amount will do.

104
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,220
I have money. How about a hundred taels?

105
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,140
I'll give you two hundred taels.

106
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,748
Get off me!
I'm the Prime Minister's daughter.

107
00:09:35,748 --> 00:09:37,540
Who knows if you're telling the truth?

108
00:09:39,351 --> 00:09:41,272
There's no way
his daughter will come here.

109
00:09:41,272 --> 00:09:42,948
Let go of me!

110
00:09:45,176 --> 00:09:47,812
If you're his daughter,
then I'm the son-in-law of the Emperor.

111
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,460
Only the Dusk Clan
can possess the snow lotus.

112
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:18,308
It's also why the Dusk Clan has
faced repeated bloodshed and turmoil.

113
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:22,940
But outsiders only know
one side of the story.

114
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:28,780
For commoners, the symbiotic relation
needs a snow lotus and a close relative.

115
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:33,340
However, member of the Dusk Clan
can bond with anyone.

116
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,100
Then the snow lotus...

117
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,780
Come pick it up at Mao hour tomorrow.

118
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,220
Are we truly the only ones left
in the Dusk Clan?

119
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,180
Who else could there be?

120
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,100
This child is adopted by me.

121
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:00,060
Asking you to give me a grandchild
is still beyond hope.

122
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,820
Look at you, all eager.

123
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,220
How could I not be?

124
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,660
I don't even know the young lady's name.

125
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:15,420
Her name is Li Chunri.

126
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:23,460
Good, we've already met.

127
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:31,420
I've told you all I know.
Please don't kill me.

128
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,900
L-Lady Liuyan.

129
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,860
He's one of my father's.

130
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,460
So all this was to use me, right?

131
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:00,780
Anyway, the mission to use you
is already completed.

132
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,980
Do you know what I've just been through?

133
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,980
What does it have to do with me?

134
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,900
This is my first time dating someone.

135
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,940
The first time, do you know that?

136
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,300
Why did you do this to me?

137
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,220
Why?

138
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,420
I was so naive.

139
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,220
Who are you, really?

140
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,380
That doesn't matter to you.

141
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:05,260
(You're not naive.
You just met the wrong person.)

142
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:23,860
Chunri.

143
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:24,100
Yes?

144
00:13:26,148 --> 00:13:27,820
If the symbiotic spell were undone,

145
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,700
would you still think of death?

146
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,580
Hard to say, I will leave eventually.

147
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:44,980
However, there are some things
I need to accomplish before that.

148
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,388
What things?

149
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,180
Help you get your revenge.

150
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,284
And?

151
00:13:57,284 --> 00:13:58,300
And...

152
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:12,220
For instance, there's the beautiful
night view of Chang'an City.

153
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,540
I haven't had the chance to see it.

154
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,900
And there are also
so many delicacies here.

155
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,860
I haven't had the chance to eat them.

156
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,900
And the handsome men in Chang'an City.

157
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,540
I've never met any of them.

158
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,300
Really? Not even one?

159
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,420
Well, it seems like there's one.

160
00:14:40,196 --> 00:14:41,260
Who is it?

161
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,276
Ji Bieqing.

162
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,436
Ji Bieqing.

163
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:56,740
Li Chunri, you'd better
think clearly before you answer.

164
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,820
Then, I haven't met one.

165
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,260
Where's the handsome guy? Where is he?

166
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:08,660
Over there? Or in the back? Or...

167
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,900
What about now?

168
00:16:13,176 --> 00:16:15,780
(Why do dark circles appear
when sleep is insufficient?)

169
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,220
(Zhou Yuhang as Yu Youde)
So our dark circles

170
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,700
are usually caused by various factors.

171
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:24,180
Including exposed blood vessels, skin
pigmentation, inflammation, allergies,

172
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,100
genetic factors, and so on.

173
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,860
Lack of sleep is a common factor.

174
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,620
When you don't have enough sleep,

175
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,340
it can cause blood vessels to dilate.

176
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:35,260
It makes the blood vessels more
prominent and forms dark circles.

177
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:41,140
Or it causes swelling around the eyes,
making dark circles more noticeable.

178
