00:01:15,012 --> 00:01:17,760
=Dr. Spring=

2
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,580
What are you going to do?

3
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,780
I was just joking.
Don't take it seriously.

4
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,900
Listen, I didn't pay for
any additional services.

5
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:46,500
You're really taking off clothes? Stop.

6
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:52,380
I was wrong. I won't escape anymore.

7
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,740
=Episode 3=

8
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,060
Don't be like this.

9
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,492
Go ahead.

10
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,940
Why have your injuries
been transferred to me?

11
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,340
How should I know?
I also don't know what's going on.

12
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,660
Do I have to kill you
before I kill myself?

13
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,300
Why did you get injured?

14
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,300
(An evil official's daughter is
in that litter.)

15
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,220
(But Li suddenly brought her back.)

16
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,980
(He must really have something to hide.)

17
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,460
No wonder Prime Minister Li got you back
at this moment.

18
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:40,460
He wanted to use this secret technique
to make you die for him.

19
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,980
I didn't expect that the two of us were
in a symbiotic relationship.

20
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,740
Are you cursing my father?

21
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,300
It's okay. Prime Minister Li
even killed me, his own daughter.

22
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,740
He's definitely a bad man.

23
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,500
What else do you know?

24
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,460
I know that you didn't kill that person.

25
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,660
I saw it from the rooftop.

26
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,900
That person had a large wound
on the back of the neck.

27
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,140
(It was kind of caused
by a blunt instrument,)

28
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,780
(causing a vertebral artery injury.)

29
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:16,620
So he was already dead
before you killed him.

30
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,460
I guessed. I'm not good at neurosurgery.

31
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,860
Nonsense.

32
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,100
You're really not a player?

33
00:03:41,756 --> 00:03:42,844
What are you doing?

34
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,420
Let me do it.

35
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,260
(She's so well-versed in medicine.)

36
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:29,060
The wound on your neck is shallow
and will heal soon.

37
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,960
The stitches are done
and will be removed after seven days.

38
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,660
Remember not to get it wet. Well, okay.

39
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,060
"Well, okay"?

40
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,580
"Okay" means it's finished.

41
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,180
"Well" is a word exclusively used
to ingratiate someone.

42
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,780
If you don't want to be offensive,
you can use this word.

43
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:53,852
Before we find a way
to lift this bond between us,

44
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,620
your life is my life.

45
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,700
Just stay here.

46
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:04,020
That is impossible. Bye.

47
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:26,980
If you escape again,
I will ruin your pretty face.

48
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,660
As long as you're alive,
I can lure Prime Minister Li out.

49
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:32,940
That's really not necessary.

50
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,620
Hero, I've prepared anti-inflammatory
and pain-relieving medicine for you.

51
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,140
Remember to take it.

52
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,700
A physician won't harm
another physician.

53
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,620
I know what tricks you're playing.

54
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,940
You put knockout drops in it?

55
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,540
Have a good sleep.

56
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,700
Could the effects be transferable too?

57
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,300
Fortunately, this is just a game.

58
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,580
Once I kill him, I can go back.

59
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,156
I am really sorry.

60
00:06:48,156 --> 00:06:50,620
When I return,
I will do my best to treat patients,

61
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,500
being a good physician
who abides by medical ethics.

62
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,860
The black market
in the guide is right here.

63
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,860
The fourth warehouse
on the fourth street, and four...

64
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,420
This is the place.

65
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:41,180
A warrior's hat was tied with a rope,
and Wugou Sword was as bright as snow.

66
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,140
Thank you.

67
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,020
Are you the top assassin
on the black market?

68
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:18,820
Are you motivated by love or revenge?

69
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,460
By death with dignity.

70
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,380
Draw the portrait and write the name.

71
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:32,380
Within two days, this person will
be dead with no corpse left.

72
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,220
(Ling's Clinic)

73
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,284
It's him.

74
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,420
We only deal with killing,
not with catching ghosts.

75
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,956
Can't you see he's a human?

76
00:09:07,136 --> 00:09:08,924
(Ling's Clinic)

77
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:16,380
Once the soul-chasing order is issued,
no one can take it back.

78
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,340
Have you decided?

79
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:29,100
If I can't do it,
I have to leave it to the professionals.

80
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:07,340
I don't have many days left to live.
Where can I go?

81
00:10:09,952 --> 00:10:11,996
(The Prime Minister's Residence)

82
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,100
Even if you look all over Chang'an City,

83
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,276
you must bring Lady Chunri back alive.

84
00:10:17,276 --> 00:10:18,364
Yes.

85
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,540
- My lady, you're back.
- My lady, you're back.

86
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:27,140
My lady, how did you come back?

87
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,628
I return to my home. Any problem?

88
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,380
After all,
I'm the Prime Minister's daughter.

89
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:44,980
At least before next
Sun and Star Conjunction, right?

90
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,420
If you don't give me a hard time,

91
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,340
I won't do anything foolish again.

92
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,980
As a daughter,

93
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,900
I am willing to do things for my father.

94
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,220
I'm concerned about your safety.

95
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,940
After all,
something awful happened yesterday.

96
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,060
Did you see
what the bad guy looked like?

97
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,140
He's buck-toothed,
like an ugly duckling.

98
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,500
Who are you talking about?

99
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,780
(What were knockout drops
in ancient times?)

100
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,420
(Wu Jifeng as Ling Xinghe)
In historical documents,

101
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:31,220
the knockout drops
are not explicitly mentioned,

102
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:34,300
but judging from its effects
and users' symptoms,

103
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,980
it is basically consistent
with ancient anesthetics.

104
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:40,220
Most people believe that flos daturae
is mixed into the knockout drops.

105
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,740
Flos daturae, also called golden flower,

106
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:46,860
generally grows by riversides,
fields, or sunny hillsides.

107
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,500
It looks bright and beautiful.

108
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,380
But like some wild mushrooms,

109
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,660
the brighter, the more toxic.

110
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,500
And the knockout drops are made
from mandrake flowers.

111
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,860
Flos daturae varies in color.

112
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:03,060
The white ones are often made
into a powder used as anesthetics

113
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:06,340
with effects, such as nerve paralysis
and muscle relaxation.

114
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,900
If you come across flos daturae,

115
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,420
I advise you to stay away from it,

116
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:13,620
lest you accidentally touch them
and get into trouble with this.
