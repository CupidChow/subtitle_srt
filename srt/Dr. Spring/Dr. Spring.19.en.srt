2
00:01:24,324 --> 00:01:25,568
=Episode 19=

3
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:52,940
Chunri, Chunri, what's going on?
What happened?

4
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,940
Aren't you my father's people?

5
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:58,340
What have you done to her? Speak!

6
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,300
Are you alright?

7
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,220
Don't just stand there! Come and help.

8
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,820
Why aren't you moving?

9
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,900
Leave it to me.

10
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,940
Don't you have more important things?
I'll get it ready.

11
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:27,620
(If the relationship is terminated,
then he must face the danger alone.)

12
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,980
Chunri, are you okay?

13
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,100
Are you okay?

14
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:06,300
It's fine. Worth it.

15
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,540
What do you mean?

16
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,780
Why are you standing there? Help her!

17
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:19,020
I remember that Yu's blood flow is
blocked in the left cervical vertebra.

18
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,820
So he can only turn left.

19
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,500
The blood lotus
didn't terminate it.

20
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,820
She's such a fool.

21
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,324
Since Li is not here,

22
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,100
we shouldn't stay here for long,
let's leave first.

23
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:17,180
Did you look for me?

24
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,980
Hmph.

25
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:29,940
Let me go, let go!

26
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,004
Chunri.

27
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,780
Father, what's happening, father?

28
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:47,300
Just as I expected, you have
formed a symbiotic relationship.

29
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,500
So you're the ruthless Li.

30
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:57,140
(Gaunt face,
weakness in the lower limbs.)

31
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,328
(Skin ulceration.)

32
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,580
(A rotten apple odor.)

33
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,500
(It seems that I was correct.)

34
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,500
(Typical diabetic patient.)

35
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:11,140
Why can you form it
even though you're not blood-related?

36
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,420
Do you want to know?

37
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,380
Then go find out in underworld

38
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:23,420
and ask those innocent people
of the Dusk Clan you killed.

39
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:08,020
Li Chunri, Prime Minister is asking you
where the snow lotus is now.

40
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:20,460
There's no more snow lotus in the world.

41
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:28,260
You think, after so many years,

42
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:31,100
I'd still know nothing
about the Dusk Clan?

43
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:37,100
Yao, oh Yao,
you really hid yourself well.

44
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,420
Yet he showed his true color for you.

45
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:46,820
Too bad you didn't see him

46
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,140
shed his last drop of blood for you.

47
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:58,100
You risked the lives of your entire clan
to protect the snow lotus before.

48
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:04,620
Now, don't blame me for killing you all,
to get rid of every last bit.

49
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,900
You think finding a scapegoat

50
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,540
can grant you eternal life?

51
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,980
With your condition,
even a hundred daughters can't save you.

52
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,740
You deeply sinful and doomed ghost!

53
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:28,340
It seems
you don't care about this brat at all.

54
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,620
Guards, stab her!

55
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,740
Don't.

56
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,220
Father, no!

57
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,260
Liuyan!

58
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,860
Liuyan.

59
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,540
I don't blame you anymore.

60
00:08:43,364 --> 00:08:44,420
Lady Liuyan.

61
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,508
Mr. Ji, you come to see me?

62
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,820
Mr. Ji, thank you
for caring about my childhood.

63
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,900
(If you like it, just let me know.)

64
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,140
Next time, if I'm in a good mood,

65
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,580
I might make you some.

66
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,940
But you will protect me, right?

67
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:05,620
I still have some innocence left.
Does it look good?

68
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,820
(I was too foolish.)

69
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,940
(You're not foolish,
you just met the wrong person.)

70
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:54,820
I did everything to find this daughter.

71
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:02,180
It still turns out this way.

72
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,820
Ling Xinghe, I'll kill every one of you!

73
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:09,820
Snow lotus.

74
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,100
I can give it to you.

75
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,100
But you must agree to two conditions.

76
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:26,420
First, let Ji Bieqing go.

77
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,380
Second,

78
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,580
let me marry Ling Xinghe.

79
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:49,100
Fine, if you dare to lie to me,

80
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,180
you all will die.

81
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,940
Good boy, do you still remember the page
I asked you to recite?

82
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,980
I remember.

83
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:07,340
Get on the bed, lean against Grandpa,
and recite it for me, okay?

84
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,388
Okay.

85
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:17,300
Blood natures qi,
the dusk natures the lotus.

86
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:22,140
Blood, rich and pulsing,
is all over the body.

87
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:27,140
With lotus in the blood,
qi propels blood flow.

88
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,620
Blood circulates through the meridians,
but may cause harm to the constitution.

89
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:36,380
Then, the blood lotus grows,
turning from clear to scarlet.

90
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:41,140
Blood natures qi,
the dusk natures the lotus.

91
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:46,100
Blood, rich and pulsing,
is all over the body.

92
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,620
(The snow lotus
can transform into two colors.)

93
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:54,700
(The white one
can form symbiotic relationship.)

94
00:11:54,700 --> 00:12:01,380
(The red one can terminate it,
hence also known as blood lotus.)

95
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:06,420
(The pistil is the most crucial, it's
the spiritual object of the Dusk Clan.)

96
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:11,740
(It requires the blood of our clan
to nourish it before it can transform.)

97
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:17,460
(It must not be used recklessly,
the clan must remember.)

98
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:29,900
Grandpa, grandpa, are you okay?

99
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,700
Kid, listen to me.

100
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,380
I have to become this lotus.

101
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,660
Only then can I
protect you and Ling Xinghe.

102
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:49,420
Sweetheart, take the lotus and hide.

103
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,940
Until Ling Xinghe comes back.

104
00:12:57,064 --> 00:13:00,968
Grandpa, grandpa, you can't die!

105
00:13:00,968 --> 00:13:05,352
Grandpa, grandpa, you can't leave me.

106
00:13:05,352 --> 00:13:11,816
Grandpa, grandpa, grandpa.

107
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,820
Search this house.

108
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:25,918
(Why does abdominal injury
cause vomiting of blood? )

109
00:13:25,918 --> 00:13:27,340
(Which part's blood is it?)

110
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,468
(Gao Tianni as Li Liuyan)
First, consider the stomach or duodenum.

111
00:13:30,468 --> 00:13:32,020
If an external injury

112
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:35,420
causes the gastrointestinal mucosa
to rupture and bleed,

113
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:38,980
it will then lead to
gastrointestinal pain and spasms.

114
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,100
Blood will be vomited from the mouth.

115
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:45,580
Second, abdominal injuries
may be accompanied by lung injuries.

116
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:48,580
Lung injuries can
cause bleeding from lung vessels,

117
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:51,940
blood will be coughed up
from the mouth when coughing.

118
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:55,940
Furthermore, if the patient's
abdominal injury is severe, they may

119
00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:00,500
suffer from the rupture of the liver
or spleen, or other serious injuries.

120
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,660
Causing the patient to experience
a severe trauma response.

121
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,940
This can lead to stress ulcers
in the gastrointestinal tract,

122
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:11,940
which also causes the patient's stomach
to bleed, resulting in vomiting blood.
