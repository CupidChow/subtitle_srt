1
00:01:15,012 --> 00:01:17,792
=Dr. Spring=

2
00:01:24,036 --> 00:01:27,104
=Episode 5=

3
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,180
I am indeed clever and skillful.

4
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,180
Who is it?

5
00:01:46,492 --> 00:01:47,500
House steward.

6
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,140
Go check on it, and move quickly.

7
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,300
Yes, sir.

8
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:56,380
Get out! Guards!

9
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,940
How dare you!
Seize him and lock him in the dungeon!

10
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,020
(Dungeon?)

11
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,876
Ling Xinghe really
doesn't put my mind at ease.

12
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,100
Where did he go
fooling around last night?

13
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:55,680
(Map of the Prime Minister's Residence)

14
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,140
It's all solid.

15
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,580
It seems that the entrance
is not within the dungeon.

16
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,780
(Where are you?)

17
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,564
(In the dungeon.)

18
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,620
In the dungeon? Got caught?

19
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:39,980
Then let him be locked up.

20
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,540
On the second thought,
he may own his body,

21
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,300
but I am the one who is hurt.

22
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,700
What if something happens to him?

23
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,220
(Chunri: Do you know the way?)

24
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:05,980
My lady.

25
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,164
Open the door.

26
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:16,180
You answer whatever I ask, understand?

27
00:04:17,948 --> 00:04:19,180
What's your name?

28
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,340
Ling Xinghe.

29
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,372
What do you do?

30
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,100
I'm a physician.

31
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,740
How long have you been
with that country girl Li Chunri?

32
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:28,900
It's personal.

33
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,948
How dare you!

34
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,700
Why doesn't he text back?

35
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,980
Do you think nobody has noticed
since you entered the residence?

36
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,820
I am the legitimate eldest daughter
of the family.

37
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:52,700
You met me
but didn't greet me or pay respects.

38
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,700
Instead, you inquired
about my father's affairs.

39
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,300
Are you very interested in my father?

40
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,140
Or are you here for another purpose?

41
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:07,836
(I tickled Xinghe.)
Hello?

42
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,468
(I tickled Xinghe.)

43
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:14,460
Last night, you climbed onto the roof
and entered my room.

44
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,020
By your skills, you don't seem like
an ordinary physician at all.

45
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:23,500
Based on the above, you are an assassin.

46
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,220
Why didn't you text me back? Why?

47
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,340
Text me back! Now!

48
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:51,140
Why are you laughing?
I may live secluded from the world,

49
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,660
but there are few people in this world
who can deceive me.

50
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,780
Assassins would not

51
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,460
cover my body in chaos.

52
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,980
That leaves only one explanation.

53
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,540
Still not text me back?

54
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:09,460
That is because you like me.

55
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,060
See, I was right!

56
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:22,740
So, inquiring my father
is your way of getting me through him.

57
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,660
Risking your life to climb onto the roof
was to get close to me.

58
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,820
A bit narcissistic,

59
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:30,620
but it's enough to
prove your level of infatuation with me.

60
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:37,100
My lady, I think there might be
some misunderstanding between us.

61
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,260
Misunderstanding? What misunderstanding?

62
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:42,580
Am I, daughter of the Prime Minister,

63
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,460
not good enough for you?

64
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,540
My lady, you're really overthinking it.

65
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:54,820
Let's see what's tougher, your mouth
or the cell floor?

66
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,260
Lock him up until he admits it.

67
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,372
Yes.

68
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,140
(Draw me a map, now.)

69
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,580
(Take twenty steps to the right,
go through the corridor,)

70
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,860
(and turn left at the pear tree.)

71
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,220
You think you can get away with it so easy
after seeing the Young Lady bathe?

72
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,540
What's going on?
Have we been discovered?

73
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:52,420
How dare you! Who do you think you are?

74
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,140
(Are they beating me
because they've discovered something?)

75
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,500
Didn't we agree not to implicate me?

76
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,700
Might as well end it once and for all.

77
00:08:27,612 --> 00:08:28,732
Strip off his clothes!

78
00:08:28,732 --> 00:08:29,820
Yes, sir!

79
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:30,908
(Just as I thought.)

80
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,940
(Could it be...)

81
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,580
Haven't established
a symbiotic relationship?

82
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:07,380
(Li Chunri, you silly girl.)

83
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,380
I can't easily let you off.

84
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,500
You owe me this.

85
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,340
(Is dermographism really an illness?)

86
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,500
(Xu Ziyin as Li Chunri)
Each scratch leaves a red mark.

87
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,020
It's a symptom of dermographism,
also known as induced urticaria.

88
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,980
It refers to
after using fingernails or other objects

89
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,860
to scratch on the skin,

90
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:03,500
welts will arise at the exact spot,
presenting as linear swellings.

91
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,420
It can be divided into
two types, simple and symptomatic.

92
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,780
Simple dermographism is more common,

93
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:11,580
and is a physiological idiosyncrasy
of normal people.

94
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,460
About five percent of normal people
exhibit this phenomenon.

95
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:17,660
Usually, induced urticaria
will disappear on their own.

96
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,220
Non-itchy simple dermographism

97
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,780
generally do not require treatment.

98
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:24,220
But it's important to avoid irritants.

99
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:27,260
If the condition becomes severe
or affects normal life,

100
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,620
then you should go to the hospital
for timely treatment.
