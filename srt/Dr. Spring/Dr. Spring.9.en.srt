00:01:14,756 --> 00:01:17,312
=Dr. Spring=

2
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,700
Try to run? After her!

3
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,460
Bro, don't let her get away.

4
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,380
Come here.

5
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,660
She is Prime Minister's daughter.

6
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,188
Will it cause trouble for us?

7
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:29,980
How about we just scare her?

8
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,580
It's almost done.
We won't have such a chance.

9
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:36,020
Help! Help!

10
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,820
Stop!

11
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,612
Are you okay?

12
00:02:11,356 --> 00:02:12,500
=Episode 9=

13
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,660
Are you okay?

14
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,340
Are you okay? Say something.

15
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,020
Stay away!

16
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:12,956
Get up.

17
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,300
Ling Xinghe, Ling Xinghe, wake up!

18
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,420
(No response. This drug will
dilate blood vessels.)

19
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:26,220
(Is the drug so strong that
low blood pressure makes him faint?)

20
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,460
(I feel my stomach expanding.)

21
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,340
(He swallowed water.
I'll press his chest to make water out.)

22
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,180
Wake up, wake up!

23
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:58,140
Are you alright?
Take it slow. Are you okay?

24
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,340
Do you feel bad? Let me check it.

25
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,940
You freaked me out, you know?

26
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,660
You jumped into the water directly.

27
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,820
What would I do
if something happened to you?

28
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,660
You may want to die, but I don't.

29
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,660
If you do this again, I will...

30
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,260
I'm sorry.

31
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,140
Don't misunderstand.
It's a physician's duty.

32
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,540
Have you made any progress?

33
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,580
I didn't make any useful progress.

34
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,380
Yet, there's quite useless progress.

35
00:05:45,248 --> 00:05:47,996
(Crown Prince's Mansion)

36
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,420
Ling Xinghe, the leader of
Yinlong Guards,

37
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,180
hasn't found the whereabouts of Li.

38
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:00,180
(Crown Prince & Lingxue Pavilion Head)
He lacks skills. You go to help.

39
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,348
Yes, sir.

40
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:20,260
Are you feeling better?

41
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,100
Not bad.

42
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:31,620
I'm sorry. I messed up the task.

43
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,820
They dared to do so to you.

44
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,340
I'm fine now.

45
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:53,020
Why don't you teach me
some self-defense moves?

46
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:58,260
If I'm in danger,
you won't feel so painful.

47
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,540
This move is to take
preventive measures.

48
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,660
Isn't it having eyes in the back?

49
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,780
This move is about being flexible.

50
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,580
Isn't it being fast?

51
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:38,740
Let me try.

52
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,084
Like this?

53
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,060
Does the drug still work?

54
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,780
Then, should I...?

55
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,540
No, I'll do it.

56
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,780
Feeling better?

57
00:08:55,420 --> 00:09:01,180
Yes, please go down a bit more.

58
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:21,540
(This time is not for the drug,
but for you.)

59
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:32,580
(Shall CPR start instantly
to the drowning one in a coma?)

60
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,700
(Xu Ziyin as Li Chunri)
If one is unconscious after drowning,

61
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,100
first, check whether he's conscious.

62
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,660
After making him ashore,
lay him flat on a safe, hard surface.

63
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:45,380
Tap on his shoulder or call his name.

64
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,980
If there is no response,
it implies a loss of consciousness.

65
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,900
Then immediately call 120.

66
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,540
Next, check his breathing and pulse.

67
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:57,460
Place your ear close to his nostrils
to listen for breathing sound.

68
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,980
See if there is
any movement of the chest.

69
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:04,420
Use the index and middle fingers
to touch the carotid artery.

70
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:07,380
The above two steps should be completed
within ten seconds.

71
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,900
If there is no breathing sound,
no chest movement, and no pulse,

72
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,540
the one's heartbeat and breathing
have abruptly stopped.

73
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:17,700
Artificial respiration and
chest compressions shall be made.

74
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,500
That is CPR.

75
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,860
Before artificial respiration,
pry open his mouth

76
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:26,820
to check for any secretions
or stomach contents.

77
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,580
If so, scoop them out with your fingers.

78
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,140
Then proceed with CPR

79
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,300
until professional
rescue personnel arrive.

80
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,220
Please be noted.

81
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,460
If the drowning one
has a heartbeat and is breathing,

82
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,136
do not perform CPR.

83
00:10:39,136 --> 00:10:40,988
At this time, cardiac compression

84
00:10:40,988 --> 00:10:43,460
may cause more pain for him,

85
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,380
worsen his condition,
and even lead to death.
