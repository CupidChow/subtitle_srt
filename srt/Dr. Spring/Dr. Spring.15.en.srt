1
00:01:15,044 --> 00:01:17,568
=Dr. Spring=

2
00:01:18,948 --> 00:01:20,640
(Ling's Clinic)

3
00:01:27,684 --> 00:01:31,520
=Episode 15=

4
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,156
I'm heading to Luoyang leisurely.

5
00:01:33,156 --> 00:01:36,180
I'll see you when it thunders. By Yao.

6
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,500
Has Yao gone to Luoyang?

7
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,220
Yangluo means dusk.

8
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,020
The Dusk Clan?

9
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,020
This is an allusion only known
to us of the Dusk Clan.

10
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,620
Thunder signifies the Waking of Insects.

11
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,460
He's telling me when he'll be back.

12
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,220
That would be tomorrow.

13
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,380
This place isn't safe anymore.

14
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,300
Although we've run away
from Li's residence,

15
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:07,300
people from Lingxue Pavilion
won't let me off for my failure.

16
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,660
They know me well.

17
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,092
Let's go.

18
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,540
(As long as you are by my side,)

19
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,860
(it's the greatest help to me.)

20
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,220
(So you asked me to follow you)

21
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,860
(just to prevent
this kind of situation?)

22
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,820
I will definitely protect you.

23
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,100
You're holding my hand now.

24
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,460
Is there any other reason
besides protecting me?

25
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,140
(Let me do it.)

26
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,380
(Li Chunri, you fool.)

27
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,220
(Ling Xinghe, you scared me to death!
Do you know that?)

28
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,100
What should I do
if anything happened to you?

29
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,580
(Remember, you are a member
of Lingxue Pavilion.)

30
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:12,620
(If you fail to complete the mission,
you will die.)

31
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,228
It was I who led you into danger.

32
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,900
Protecting you is my responsibility.

33
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,380
Responsibility?

34
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,300
So is everything you've done all along

35
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,340
just out of guilt and responsibility?

36
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:37,380
If that's really the case,
I don't need you to bear it.

37
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:44,060
You don't get it.
You're risking your life for a fugitive.

38
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,220
Do you think I fear death?

39
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,060
Or do you think I am a hindrance to you?

40
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,180
I'll take revenge myself.

41
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,780
I'll find the antidote soon,

42
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:11,340
and then end our connection.

43
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,060
Be careful. I'll go out and check.

44
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,340
Have I told you

45
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,700
I never wanted to see you again?

46
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,980
You're the one sent by the pavilion.

47
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,700
And this time it's a strict order.

48
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,500
Wait! We still have some things
to take care of.

49
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,196
What do you mean?

50
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,620
You really want to end our connection?

51
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,980
You've seen it.
There are dangers all around me.

52
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,620
There will be more situations like this.

53
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,340
I get things wrong.

54
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:23,540
Then I won't drag you down with me.

55
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,660
I'll end our connection myself.

56
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,260
- Chunri.
- It's faster this way.

57
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,140
Everyone wants to kill you.

58
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,380
You might as well kill yourself.

59
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,492
Shut up!

60
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,180
Chunri, don't be like this.

61
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,660
Do you think I can't do it?

62
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,900
I know you're not afraid of death.

63
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,460
But I can't watch you die.

64
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,380
Protecting you is my responsibility.
And it's also because...

65
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,348
What?

66
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,300
Because I like you.

67
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,820
Since when did you start to like me?

68
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,580
Was it while we were here?

69
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,900
Earlier than that.

70
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,300
When we were at the medicinal pool?

71
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,460
Even earlier.

72
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,820
All right.

73
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,100
Have you had enough?

74
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,300
Do you two take me seriously at all?

75
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,700
I gave you time to say goodbye.
That's all I can do.

76
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,412
If you're done talking,
I'll complete my mission.

77
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,860
If you kill her,

78
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,500
then you'll never find Li.

79
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:02,940
Here we go again.
Li has more than one daughter.

80
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,420
Because we have what Li wants.

81
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,420
Why not gentler?

82
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,380
It's fine. It doesn't hurt.

83
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,444
Symbiosis.

84
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,220
Do you feel something different
in your body?

85
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,100
This is...

86
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,060
Snow lotus?

87
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,100
Right here?

88
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,540
Ouch!

89
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,388
Lady Liuyan.

90
00:08:18,244 --> 00:08:19,396
Hey!

91
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,620
What are you doing here?

92
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,860
I come to find you.

93
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,620
Why didn't you enter through the door?

94
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,620
Isn't the door locked?

95
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:41,980
So before this snow lotus blooms,

96
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,860
I can't kill you?

97
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,540
Sorry, I'm in a dangerous situation now.

98
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,620
I can only drag you down.

99
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,500
Stop arguing.

100
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,780
I've persuaded my mother to forgive you.
They don't blame you anymore.

101
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,820
Are you sure you won't go back?

102
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,860
Lady Liuyan, we have places to stay.

103
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,580
It'll be very dangerous to follow us.

104
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,860
Dangerous? Are there people
who try to kill you?

105
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,820
But you'll protect me, right?

106
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:17,220
So what exactly do you guys do?

107
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,980
Why do I feel you're more dangerous?

108
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,500
(Taking her with us would be more likely
to attract Li's people.)

109
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:33,580
(Wouldn't that allow us
to find clues about Li?)

110
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,460
Then let's go together.

111
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,700
It's a reward. You're welcome.

112
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,860
Where are we heading next?

113
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,940
The clinic isn't safe anymore.

114
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:55,140
So we need to find a secluded place
to settle down.

115
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:59,380
Secluded? I do know of a place.

116
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:04,380
Are you talking about that place?

117
00:10:16,584 --> 00:10:19,220
(Can adding blood to medicine
cure all diseases?)

118
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:24,060
(Zhou Yuhang as Yu Youde)
This statement is absolutely wrong.

119
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,820
There might be some records
in folk remedies.

120
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:30,300
But legitimate TCM doesn't even
have theories about using human blood.

121
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,780
Let alone use such a method
to cure diseases.

122
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:37,220
Using human blood is against morality.
It's not accepted by the mainstream.

123
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:41,660
Like the human-blood steamed buns,
they are considered unorthodox.
