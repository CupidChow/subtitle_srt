00:01:14,724 --> 00:01:17,120
=Dr. Spring=

2
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,980
No one comes to report after a night.

3
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:27,580
This wild country girl is energetic.

4
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,380
Mother, where are you going?

5
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,780
Let me take you to watch a good show.

6
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:38,900
It's called "What's Done Is Done". Come.

7
00:01:42,112 --> 00:01:46,716
=Episode 10=

8
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,732
Open the door.

9
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,020
W-Why is it you two?

10
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,060
Who else could it be?

11
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,660
It's just a cold.

12
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,060
You don't have to make such a fuss.

13
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,180
Here. I cooled it off. It's not hot.

14
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,980
Good girl, drink it.

15
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,084
Bitter.

16
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,900
Not bitter if I feed you.

17
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,460
Mother, it's "What's Done Is Wrong".

18
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,220
Yan, Yan!

19
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,980
My lady!

20
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,700
You two slept together before marriage.

21
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,620
How disgraceful it is! You're shameless!

22
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:56,764
Whose behavior is really disgraceful?

23
00:02:56,764 --> 00:02:57,852
You...

24
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,580
- Madam, it's done.
- You're disgraceful.

25
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,900
It's good. I'll keep it.

26
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,716
You should paint her more often.

27
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,980
After all, Father isn't here,
and she's so charming.

28
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:25,580
You must be taking lots of Lust Pills.

29
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:30,700
Y-You!

30
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,860
Madam, 10 wen.

31
00:03:33,244 --> 00:03:34,332
- No!
- Get lost!

32
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:38,180
Madam, calm down! Don't be mad!

33
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,540
She passed out!

34
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,580
Madam!

35
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,020
Is she pretending?

36
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,420
She passed out! Get a physician!

37
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,700
Madam! Get a physician!

38
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,780
- (Chest pain? Angina?)
- Madam, wake up.

39
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,340
Madam!

40
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,220
- What do we do?
- Are you okay?

41
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,980
Stop it! Don't touch her!

42
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:57,340
Shut up! if you want her to be good,
just be quiet!

43
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:00,732
Go get a physician!

44
00:04:00,732 --> 00:04:01,780
(Lips turn purple.)

45
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,740
My lady, what are you doing?

46
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:04,740
(Fingers turn cyanotic.)

47
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,420
What are you doing?

48
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,540
(Legs are swollen.)

49
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,972
Does she usually feel sick?

50
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,580
After she gave birth,

51
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,620
her health got worse.

52
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,700
Her legs hurt sometimes.

53
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,700
She always feels tired.

54
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,828
Could it be...?

55
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,700
No! Why did I tell you this?

56
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,660
Madam, wake up, please!

57
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,300
Physician Ling is here.

58
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,028
Move! Let me hold her.

59
00:04:32,028 --> 00:04:33,180
No!

60
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,860
The physician will see her. Get out.

61
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,260
Why are you still there? Come help me.

62
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,820
- What are you doing?
- Rest assured!

63
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,980
What are you doing, my lady?

64
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,460
Are you trying to save her?

65
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,380
Have you forgotten what she did?

66
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,740
You're a girl. She gave you those pills.

67
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,020
If I hadn't arrived in time,

68
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,580
do you know what would have happened?

69
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,620
I'm not gonna help her.

70
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,460
Help me get her to the bed.

71
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,740
Quickly!

72
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:29,860
You are...

73
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,900
An eye for an eye. A pill for a pill.

74
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,980
Open your mouth.

75
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,700
Not afraid of becoming an accomplice?

76
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:56,580
Even a murderer can't compete with you.

77
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,780
Tsk. These symptoms

78
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,380
might indicate CTEPH

79
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,900
caused by thrombus detachment.

80
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:11,180
They not only dilate pulmonary vessels
but also have anticoagulant effects.

81
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,380
She should be grateful.

82
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,652
I don't get what you said,

83
00:06:14,652 --> 00:06:15,860
but a person like her

84
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,860
won't regret it even if you save her.

85
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,396
Li Chunri shouldn't save her, but...

86
00:06:27,836 --> 00:06:29,100
(Zhang Ziqi must save her.)

87
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,660
The physician is here! Make way!

88
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,940
Sir, is she okay?

89
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,180
The pulse is irregular.

90
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,100
But it has begun to stabilize.

91
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,860
She just needs to rest well in her room.

92
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,180
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

93
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,652
The house steward asked
Lady Chunri and Mr. Ling to come over.

94
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,660
Mr. Ling's family brought gifts here.

95
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,060
Family?

96
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,204
Yao?

97
00:07:18,912 --> 00:07:21,500
(Prime Minister's Residence)

98
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,060
He has caused you trouble these days.

99
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:29,260
Mr. Ji, you're too kind.
You brought such generous gifts.

100
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,900
Why didn't you send someone to tell me?

101
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,540
We would be well prepared now.

102
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,700
I didn't want to bother you.

103
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,460
Not at all!

104
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:51,020
Once the soul-chasing order is issued,
no one can take it back.

105
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,300
If you can't finish it quickly,
I don't mind doing it myself.

106
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,580
This must be my future sister-in-law.

107
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,700
You really look gorgeous.

108
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:09,580
Thank you. You're really thoughtful.

109
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,380
This way, please.

110
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,420
You're welcome.

111
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,660
Why are you here?

112
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,100
I told you once the order was issued,
no one could take it back.

113
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,860
You've helped me a lot.

114
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:32,340
It's your marriage.
Of course I want to help you.

115
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:36,620
Have I not warned you?

116
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,940
Stay out of our business.

117
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,100
I'm just here to pay a visit.

118
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:46,860
I wonder why Mr. Ling is trapped here.

119
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,100
I've searched Lady Liuyan's room
and the dungeon these days.

120
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,380
Only the Madam's room
had a suspicious medicinal fragrance.

121
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:00,020
Hey, are you guys finished talking?

122
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,260
I've waited a long time.

123
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,860
Stay away from him. He's dangerous.

124
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,740
He's my cousin!

125
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,740
He's not your cousin!

126
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,260
Of course I'm his cousin.

127
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,316
I...

128
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:21,460
Guys, let's just forget it.

129
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,588
Forget it?

130
00:09:22,588 --> 00:09:23,740
What?

131
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,340
Getting married?

132
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,180
Or killing...

133
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:32,340
Killing me with kindness!

134
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,980
Wow, the Ling Family must be wealthy.

135
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:40,100
Such generous gifts for a bride price.

136
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,940
No, not at all.

137
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,100
All thanks to my cousin.

138
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,900
You're quite welcome.

139
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:54,220
Mother said she is seriously ill,
and it's not proper to throw a party.

140
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,324
She asked you to leave.

141
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:01,700
The Madam is ill? I have another gift.

142
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:11,220
Ling Xinghe, I'm seriously ill now.

143
00:10:11,772 --> 00:10:12,860
What else do you want?

144
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,540
We're here to pay a visit.

145
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:29,180
How dare you treat my people...

146
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:33,580
For all I know, there are no people
as you said among officials in Jingzhao

147
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,100
like judicial officials and censors.

148
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,620
How would you like to explain it?

149
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:40,988
I...

150
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,420
Am I right?

151
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,940
Does the Madam keep them to herself?

152
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,740
I don't understand what you said.

153
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:52,700
Why don't we go straight in
and ask the Prime Minister?

154
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,940
- How dare you!
- What are you doing?

155
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,052
Stop it!

156
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:03,060
(Was there a concept of heart disease
in ancient times?)

157
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:07,660
(Zhou Yuhang as Yu Youde)
Chest impediment is heart disease.

158
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:11,740
It can be treated with remedies
like massage, acupuncture, diet,

159
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,460
rest, and so on.

160
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,100
For example, congenital heart disease.

161
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:19,420
Ancient physicians applied
syndrome differentiation and treatment.

162
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,460
Patients can take medicines

163
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,340
that boost qi, warm yang,
move blood, resolve stasis,

164
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,380
unblock collaterals, and relieve pain.

165
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:30,220
Herbs like Renshen, Huangqi, and Guizhi
can improve heart function.

166
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,820
Acupuncture is helpful as well.

167
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:36,380
Stimulating acupuncture points promotes
the circulation of qi and blood,

168
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:39,500
enhances immunity, and regulates
the functions of internal organs,

169
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,860
thereby treating the disease.
