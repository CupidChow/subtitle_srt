1
00:01:15,076 --> 00:01:17,632
=Dr. Spring=

2
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:22,020
Why don't we go straight in
and ask the Prime Minister?

3
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,980
- What nerve!
- What are you doing?

4
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,180
- Stop!
- What are you doing?

5
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:30,236
=Episode 11=

6
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,500
I'm just afraid of others gossiping.

7
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,220
That's why I've hidden my room so well.

8
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,660
I didn't expect it to be discovered.

9
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,540
They are the best masseurs I have.

10
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,060
As for the matter with Chunri,
I just can't stand it.

11
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,620
The Master brought the child
born by a concubine into the house.

12
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,100
That's why I did that.

13
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,940
As for your marriage,

14
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,180
I can't be the one to decide.

15
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,980
Then please introduce me
to the Prime Minister.

16
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,740
I haven't seen him for half a year.

17
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,420
Who knows what he's been up to?

18
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,900
Only his mother can still talk to him.

19
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,908
Elder Madam?

20
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,540
Elder? That's right.

21
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,420
(So the suspicious place
that Mr. Ling mentioned)

22
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:10,820
(is the massage room where
young men give her massages in private.)

23
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,780
(What do you know?)

24
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,980
(Ungrateful.)

25
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,460
(Without me helping catch those two,)

26
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,180
(how could you deal with the madam?)

27
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,780
(It's not as simple as you think.)

28
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,420
(The layout here is complex.)

29
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:29,540
(On the first day, I followed
the house steward into a secret room.)

30
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:33,740
(But the entrance there
just disappeared out of nowhere.)

31
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:36,620
(You can't even find the place
you went into once.)

32
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:40,340
(What do I need you for?
I might as well kill you.)

33
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:42,940
Are you two finished?

34
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,420
You've been making eyes
at each other all day.

35
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,540
And you, tell me!

36
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,900
How exactly can I lift that order?

37
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,700
Once it's issued, someone must die.
Make your own decision.

38
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:00,300
Based on what he did to you,
why are you still hesitating?

39
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:10,260
The gift has been brought here.
You better leave immediately.

40
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:16,300
Mr. Ji, the room has been arranged.

41
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,180
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

42
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:23,380
Then I will settle in for a few days.

43
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,660
I'm afraid we need to get married soon.

44
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,940
Don't you see what's happening?

45
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:48,260
Why do you still think of that?

46
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:52,180
Only the Elder Madam's room
remains unsearched now.

47
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,420
So I think we might use it
as an excuse to investigate.

48
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:06,260
So, your colleague came
with the same purpose?

49
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,180
Colleague?

50
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,940
He's Just a loser.

51
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,740
You two are both from Lingxue Pavilion?

52
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,100
How do you know?

53
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,980
Not only do I know this,

54
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:31,580
I also know that Ji Bieqing is
the chief of Wugou Section,

55
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:35,660
the best assassin of Lingxue Pavilion,
known as the Devil Death.

56
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,420
You've learned about him.

57
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,140
In that case,

58
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,740
I have another option for a partner.

59
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,180
He is not like me.

60
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,180
He may attack the Elder Madam
just to achieve his goal.

61
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,580
What? Seriously?

62
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,740
Anyway, we must get ahead of him.

63
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:04,540
Remember, don't reveal our relationship.

64
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:09,980
Our relationship?

65
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,820
What kind of relationship do we have?

66
00:06:40,896 --> 00:06:43,740
(Current location: Elder Madam's house)

67
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,860
- It's all my mother's fault.
- Why is she here?

68
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,100
Mr. Ling stayed away from me.

69
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,420
I was born as a lady
with a maidservant's fate.

70
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,596
Mr. Ji?

71
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,020
(Did he follow me all the way here?)

72
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,740
Why are you here?

73
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,300
Did you get turned away?

74
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:24,500
I just wanted to
complain to grandmother,

75
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,620
but she hates it when people visit.

76
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:32,380
Thank you, Mr. Ji.
I'll return it to you after I wash it.

77
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,620
What is this?

78
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,220
Snacks I made for my grandmother.

79
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,780
What a pity! I made them overnight.
She didn't even see them.

80
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,420
Did you make them yourself?

81
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:47,060
Yes. Would you like to try one?

82
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:51,620
Well then, I'll give you one.

83
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,644
Quite sweet.

84
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:15,820
(Another man has been enraptured by me.)

85
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,380
(To eat a snack I made,)

86
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,820
(he did so many unnecessary things.)

87
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:23,780
(With it being so sweet,
it'd probably be hard to detect poison.)

88
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,660
If you like it, just tell me.

89
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,420
Maybe next time I'm in a good mood,

90
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,380
I'll make some for you.

91
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,452
Mr. Ji.

92
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:40,020
Mr. Ling, why are you here again?

93
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,460
Li Chunri, why do you come here, too?

94
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,700
I heard our grandmother has been
troubled by a stubborn illness.

95
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,580
I came with my husband
to make a pulse diagnosis.

96
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,420
Lady Chunri and I come to pay a visit
to the Elder Madam.

97
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,860
Please go tell her.

98
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:10,540
First come, first served.

99
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,820
Guests first, host later.

100
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,820
Lady Liuyan wouldn't let us
wait outside, would she?

101
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,140
If you know she's the elder lady,

102
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,140
you should be politer.

103
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,940
All right, stop arguing over me.

104
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,180
The Elder Madam feels sick.
She doesn't want to see guests.

105
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,420
They've already noticed.

106
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,460
We're trapped here.
Don't make a rash act.

107
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,700
What a nuisance!

108
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,676
Just a sec.

109
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,420
Are you comparing these two men with me?

110
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,708
Let's begin.

111
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,300
What can I say
when it comes to Scholar Zhang?

112
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,180
He still didn't date any woman
at the age of 23.

113
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,420
Cui Yingying resided in Puzhou.

114
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:23,060
She fell in love with the wrong person.

115
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:26,820
Stop! This story is too long.

116
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,580
Is there something more clickbaity?

117
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:32,580
Add some popular science content
that the elderly would like.

118
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:42,180
For instance, a sixty-year-old woman
suddenly gets pregnant.

119
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,860
The reason turns out to be this.

120
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:50,020
Or Mrs. Zhang was paralyzed in bed
and after she ate one thing,

121
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,380
she started to walk the next day.

122
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:06,540
Or Mr. Zhang can draw fresh blood
from his skin at any time

123
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,660
without any wounds.

124
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:11,260
What should I do?
Will Li Chunri get in first?

125
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,940
Was he cursed?

126
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:14,940
Why?

127
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,020
Want to know?

128
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:21,500
In case it happens,
I can perform some tricks.

129
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,300
If you want to know, let us in.

130
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,660
Then you can unlock more VIP chapters.

131
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,500
Life is hard.
An assassin is performing tricks.

132
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,300
The Elder Madam sent a message.

133
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,540
Get lost! It's so noisy!

134
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:19,540
Forget it! She has seen everything.

135
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,460
Except for her beloved son,

136
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,660
she won't give anyone a chance.

137
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,060
Then I'll go to see my dad first.

138
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,860
How can you find your dad?

139
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:30,620
I finally knew it after living here
for so many years.

140
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,700
Not only do I suffer
but I also live like a widow.

141
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:37,692
How can you say things like that
behind my back?

142
00:12:37,692 --> 00:12:39,644
(Zhao Dieling,
Prime Minister Li's mother)

143
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:44,740
Behind your back? Even if he was here,
what I said wouldn't change.

144
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,500
And I would have more to complain about.

145
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,620
You've been living here all these years.

146
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,860
You haven't given birth to a son.

147
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,660
You were jealous, not allowing him
to have a concubine.

148
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:02,620
What if we don't have descendants?

149
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:05,460
What? If I was jealous,

150
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:08,180
then what about his daughter Li Chunri?

151
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:11,460
I can't bear a son.
Another woman can't bear a son, either.

152
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,180
Fine, Zhang Cui'e.

153
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:20,020
Is it because I always feel sick?
So you think I can't deal with you.

154
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,300
How can that be?

155
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,620
Look at you, you look well!

156
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:28,580
You speak in such a loud voice!

157
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:35,980
You want me to die soon, right?

158
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:40,140
Family issues have been difficult
to solve since ancient times.

159
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:44,340
Don't get me wrong!

160
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:48,860
I wish you good health and longevity.

161
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:52,620
I wish you could outlive your son.

162
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,060
Y-You!

163
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:00,740
Quick! Someone!

164
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,420
What a family!
They passed out the same way.

165
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,300
Elder Madam!

166
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,540
What should I do? I didn't say much.

167
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,340
Elder Madam!

168
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,300
Lift her up!

169
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:17,020
Elder Madam, are you okay?

170
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,700
Let us the physicians see her.
Others stay away.

171
00:14:25,984 --> 00:14:28,340
(Does eating food high in sugar content
lead to diabetes?)

172
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:31,860
(Gao Tianni as Li Liuyan)
It increases the risk of diabetes.

173
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,780
But this is not the only factor.

174
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,140
Diabetes is a complex disease.

175
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,860
It is caused by the combined effects
of multiple factors,

176
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:43,460
including genetic factors, lifestyle,
and body weight.

177
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:47,260
Different types of sugars
have varying effects on diabetes.

178
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,244
For example, fructose and glucose.

179
00:14:49,244 --> 00:14:52,460
Their Impacts on the risk vary.

180
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:56,100
The amount of sugar intake
is an important factor as well.

181
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,740
Excessive intake of high-sugar foods

182
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:00,700
can lead to weight gain
and insulin resistance,

183
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,580
thus increasing the risk of
developing type 2 diabetes.

184
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:07,020
Eating sugar doesn't directly cause it,

185
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,580
but eating too much sugar

186
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:11,380
will lead to sugars
entering the bloodstream.

187
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,180
This increases insulin secretion.

188
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:16,140
Consequently, the balance of insulin
in the body is disrupted,

189
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,700
causing robust body metabolism.

190
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,380
Sebaceous glands secrete excessively,
clogging pores.

191
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,180
To put it simply, it can lead to acne.

192
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:27,420
So, sugar is sweet,
but don't eat it too much.
