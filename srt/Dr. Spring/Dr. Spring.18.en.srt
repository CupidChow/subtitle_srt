00:01:14,628 --> 00:01:17,440
=Dr. Spring=

2
00:01:47,684 --> 00:01:51,744
=Episode 18=

3
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,900
Is that you, Ling Xinghe?

4
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:05,100
Kid, why is it you? Where's Yao?

5
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,620
Grandpa asked me to give you this.

6
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,380
Then he left for a long journey.

7
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,060
How did Yao make it bloom?

8
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,980
This is the snow lotus?

9
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,700
Yeah.

10
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,860
Why is it red?

11
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:46,900
Yao had the kid tell me
that it can come in two colors.

12
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,420
The white ones
can form a symbiotic relationship,

13
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,860
while the red ones can terminate it.

14
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,060
It's also called 'blood lotus'.

15
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:59,220
Dissolving the pistil in water can
create a red liquid, the 'blood water'.

16
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,100
Drinking the 'Blood Water'
can terminate the relationship.

17
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,740
This is what was written
on the torn page?

18
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,940
We've learned
of the traitor's hiding place.

19
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,100
We'll take action tonight.

20
00:03:16,804 --> 00:03:17,820
So we...

21
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:22,500
So we need to terminate it right now.

22
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,300
Once we drink this,

23
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,100
our symbiotic relationship is done.

24
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,260
What are you hesitating for?
Aren't you afraid of dying for him?

25
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,300
If you're not afraid, I am.

26
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,660
Don't forget
you're the sacrifice for Li.

27
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:56,620
Come on,
let's dissolve this pistil in water.

28
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,820
Leave it to me.

29
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,220
Don't you have more important matters?
I'll get it ready.

30
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:12,260
This is the Li's hiding place
the shadow guard disclosed. Take a look.

31
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,420
The deserted courtyard
actually conceals another residence.

32
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,900
All guards
are stationed on the perimeter.

33
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,940
We can avoid the guards
from the east side and sneak in.

34
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,540
Catch Li off guard and kill him.

35
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:27,380
Li is suspicious. Could this be
another one of his schemes?

36
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,260
He might wanna conserve his strength
and distract us.

37
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,540
There is a possibility.

38
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,500
Then we'll just play along.

39
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:41,980
Make noise on the east side to attract
soldiers and let Li think he has us.

40
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,540
Then we'll enter through the main gate
and go straight for his head.

41
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,460
Understood.

42
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,860
Once this operation is initiated,
it cannot be reversed.

43
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,940
I've specially prepared
'blood water blind box'.

44
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,100
Let's each choose a cup.

45
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,060
If fate wants us
to terminate our relationship right now,

46
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,380
then so be it.

47
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,420
(You don't want to end it either,
do you?)

48
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,220
(As long as you're safe,
I'm okay with anything.)

49
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,900
Stop choosing, just drink.

50
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,020
I don't feel well.
I'll go rest for a while.

51
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,700
Chunri.

52
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,812
Ah.

53
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,420
Chunri, Chunri, are you alright?

54
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,780
Your hand is hurt.

55
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,020
It's nothing.

56
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:10,220
It seems the blood water worked. We...

57
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,860
This means our relationship
has been terminated.

58
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,300
Aren't you supposed to take action?
Go get ready.

59
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,860
I'll go take care of my wound.

60
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,820
Prime Minister,
we've found their people.

61
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,300
They are hiding in the Yichun House
in Chang'an City.

62
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,860
They sure know how to hide.

63
00:07:41,924 --> 00:07:43,060
House steward.

64
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,132
Yes, sir.

65
00:07:44,132 --> 00:07:45,300
Send someone over there now.

66
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,180
Don't let even a sparrow escape.

67
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,764
I understand.

68
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:31,460
You really went to
great lengths for her.

69
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,300
Take a look at yourself.

70
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,972
Let's go.

71
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,580
(This day has finally come.)

72
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,916
Report!

73
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,940
Prime Minister, the guards we sent
after Lady Liuyan haven't returned.

74
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:37,740
Now that the bait has been taken,
let's catch them all at once.

75
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,220
Lady Chunri, my apologies.

76
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,500
Let me go!

77
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,180
Aren't you my father's men?
Why are you arresting me?

78
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:17,180
Chunri, what in the world is going on?

79
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,876
Don't worry.

80
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,220
At least allow me to tidy up.

81
00:11:58,664 --> 00:12:01,220
(Which blood vessel is severed
in self-decapitation?)

82
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:05,060
(Xu Ziyin as Li Chunri)
The carotid or the external carotid are important arteries of the neck.

83
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,340
The carotid arteries are located
on both sides of the neck.

84
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,940
They are high-pressure arteries
with a very rich blood flow.

85
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,900
They supply most
of the blood to the brain.

86
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,740
The external carotid arteries are another
critical group of arteries in the neck.

87
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,700
They provide part
of the blood supply to the brain.

88
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,420
Especially to
the posterior cerebral fossa.

89
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:22,380
Cutting the external carotid artery
can cause severe bleeding and danger.

90
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,100
So we must cherish life.

91
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,340
And protect our neck arteries.
Don't commit suicide.

92
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:30,340
If he kisses there, well, no matter
how close the relationship is,

93
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,100
don't apply too much force
in this area while kissing.

94
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,300
Ensuring the safety of life
is most important.
