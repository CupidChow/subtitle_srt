1
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:33,824
Hello?

2
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:35,577
Hello?

3
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:38,579
What time is it right now?

4
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:42,125
Excuse me?

5
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:42,918
Who are you?

6
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:44,503
Wait, you're the one calling me...

7
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:46,295
Who are you at this hour?

8
00:00:46,295 --> 00:00:47,965
Are you with Jiyoung right now?

9
00:00:48,255 --> 00:00:49,715
Put Jiyoung on the phone right now

10
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:52,260
You have the wrong number

11
00:00:53,302 --> 00:00:54,637
Who do you think you're dealing with?

12
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:55,722
Hey!

13
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,264
Who are you to answer Jiyoung's phone?

14
00:00:57,264 --> 00:00:59,016
Why are you answering?

15
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:01,686
How long has it been since we broke up?

16
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:03,271
Put Jiyoung on quickly

17
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:04,523
Are you drunk?

18
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,192
I don't care if others are drunk or not!

19
00:01:08,275 --> 00:01:09,945
Stop beating around the bush

20
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:11,278
Put Jiyoung on quickly

21
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:13,532
No...

22
00:01:13,864 --> 00:01:14,949
You're drunk right now

23
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:15,951
You called the wrong number

24
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:17,077
I'm going to hang up

25
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:18,869
If you hang up now...

26
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:21,164
You're going to kill someone

27
00:01:21,789 --> 00:01:22,416
What?

28
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:26,545
I'm at the pub at Boknae-dong intersection

29
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:28,295
Tell Jiyoung to come right now

30
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:31,465
But Jiyoung...

31
00:01:31,465 --> 00:01:32,467
I don't even know who that is and I...

32
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:35,594
I don't care who you are, just

33
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:37,556
If she doesn't come today...

34
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:40,099
I'm just going to die

35
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:41,101
Think carefully

36
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:42,351
Crazy bastard

37
00:01:57,992 --> 00:01:59,952
I don't care who you are

38
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:04,081
Just if she doesn't come today...

39
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:06,835
I'm just going to die

40
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,606
Hello?

41
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:28,731
Hello? Jiyoung

42
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:29,690
Jiyoung...

43
00:02:45,706 --> 00:02:46,750
Who is this?

44
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,465
Are you going to die?

45
00:02:54,298 --> 00:02:54,965
What?

46
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:58,552
Who are you to keep...

47
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:02,014
You were looking for Jiyoung on the phone earlier

48
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:04,518
Saying you'd die if Jiyoung didn't come

49
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:07,603
So you're...

50
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,148
Jiyoung's boyfriend?

51
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:13,985
What about Jiyoung?

52
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:14,902
Where is Jiyoung?

53
00:03:14,902 --> 00:03:15,778
No

54
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:19,157
I don't even know your Jiyoung

55
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,574
Because you keep calling

56
00:03:20,574 --> 00:03:21,867
I couldn't even sleep...

57
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:24,913
Do you know how annoyed I am?

58
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,873
I've been working two jobs for 3 days straight without sleep

59
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,416
I finally fell asleep today

60
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:32,838
That can't be

61
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:34,548
I...

62
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,298
Jiyoung's number

63
00:03:36,298 --> 00:03:37,884
I can't have it wrong

64
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,929
I also changed my number recently

65
00:03:42,304 --> 00:03:43,431
Probably that Jiyoung person

66
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:44,891
Changed her number

67
00:03:49,353 --> 00:03:51,565
She even changed her number...

68
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:55,152
Well, you didn't die, so that's good

69
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:56,695
Go home

70
00:03:56,902 --> 00:03:58,320
She asked me to marry her

71
00:04:03,617 --> 00:04:06,413
Said we should live happily together

72
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,875
I really only believed in those words

73
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:23,179
When people date, they all say that

74
00:04:24,972 --> 00:04:26,891
Have you been through a rebound breakup?

75
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:30,769
Suddenly she likes another guy

76
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,773
Is there something I didn't give her?

77
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:37,943
Hey...

78
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,070
Do I look like a good person?

79
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,202
A bit naive though

80
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,454
What's wrong with being naive?

81
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,831
I...

82
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:53,543
I loved her enough to give her everything I had

83
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,838
What's wrong with that?

84
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,135
I'm going to go now

85
00:05:03,135 --> 00:05:04,471
Don't call again

86
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,014
Go home quickly, okay?

87
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:12,938
Shit

88
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,152
So heavy

89
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:22,739
Hey, snap out of it, will you?

90
00:05:23,989 --> 00:05:26,326
Where's your house? Just the home address...

91
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:27,284
Han River

92
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:28,452
What did you say?

93
00:05:28,994 --> 00:05:30,454
Mister...

94
00:05:31,121 --> 00:05:32,958
Take me to the Han River

95
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:34,751
I'm going to jump

96
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,293
Damn

97
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:46,179
So freaking heavy

98
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:03,780
Look, even if we're both guys

99
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,947
You can't do this anywhere

100
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,958
Your face doesn't match your actions at all

101
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,086
Why would you die?

102
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,682
This is going to get me in trouble

103
00:06:41,358 --> 00:06:42,735
Jiyoung

104
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,197
I can't live without you

105
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,492
Please come back

106
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,759
What about me?

107
00:07:06,842 --> 00:07:08,969
What about me? Are you just leaving?

108
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:11,972
Can you live without me?

109
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,351
I can't, I can't live without you

110
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,603
We promised

111
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,356
We said we'd stay together, right?

112
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,067
Come back

113
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:23,902
Huh? Please

114
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:25,277
I'm sorry

115
00:07:25,277 --> 00:07:26,905
Come back!

116
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:32,077
I feel like I'm going to die without you

117
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:34,661
I'll really be good

118
00:07:34,661 --> 00:07:35,746
I won't bother you anymore

119
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:36,998
I'll just watch

120
00:07:37,414 --> 00:07:39,416
You know I'm obedient, right?

121
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,460
Do whatever you want

122
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,170
I'll just stay quietly by your side

123
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:43,797
Huh?

124
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:45,590
Don't wait for me

125
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:47,884
I'm not coming back

126
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,304
Everyone keeps living

127
00:07:53,722 --> 00:07:54,932
Live well

128
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:56,393
Seop

129
00:08:07,277 --> 00:08:09,197
What do you mean you can't live?

130
00:08:10,197 --> 00:08:11,782
Everyone keeps living

131
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:22,793
Shit, this is really...

132
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,092
Don't go

133
00:08:44,064 --> 00:08:46,192
Why am I doing this?

134
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,610
I'm sleepy too

135
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:15,346
Don't go

136
00:09:16,805 --> 00:09:18,056
I miss you
