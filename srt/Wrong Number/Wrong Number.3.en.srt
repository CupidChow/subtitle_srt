1
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:28,612
Die! Die! Die!

2
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,349
Hey, about yesterday...

3
00:00:58,684 --> 00:00:59,893
Let's call it even

4
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:01,269
Huh?

5
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,273
Actually, if we compare

6
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:09,695
free accommodation and one-sided physical contact

7
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,655
I'd say about 40 to 60?

8
00:01:15,157 --> 00:01:18,202
So if hyung apologizes just a bit more

9
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:22,791
Let's pretend it never happened

10
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,876
I won't tell anyone about it

11
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:31,425
But why did you just stay still?

12
00:01:33,175 --> 00:01:33,760
What?

13
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:36,679
No, you...

14
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:38,222
Why did you just stay still?

15
00:01:38,222 --> 00:01:39,974
You should have thrown a punch or something

16
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:42,226
Ah

17
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,688
Well, actually...

18
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:48,150
I'm the type who can't really refuse people's kindness

19
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:50,110
What?

20
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:53,362
No...

21
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,615
Hyung's eyes looked so sad

22
00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:01,579
Like you were about to cry

23
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:04,373
I'm the type who can't stand seeing others cry

24
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,588
Sorry

25
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:13,090
Just forget it, sorry

26
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,512
Still, it felt quite human

27
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:22,893
In front of the camera you seemed really like a hyung

28
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:26,896
I thought hyung makes mistakes when drinking too

29
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:35,530
Are you leaving, hyung?

30
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:37,907
Yeah

31
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,117
I'm going

32
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:42,079
Hyung, let's go together

33
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:55,717
Hyung, are you going to the station?

34
00:02:58,302 --> 00:02:59,679
No, I finished what I had to do

35
00:03:00,012 --> 00:03:01,347
I should head home now

36
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,099
Yeah

37
00:03:07,394 --> 00:03:08,146
Sorry

38
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:14,945
I'll call you later

39
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:16,320
Okay

40
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:26,914
It's been a while

41
00:03:26,914 --> 00:03:27,706
Seop

42
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:30,418
Yeah

43
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,170
It's been a while

44
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,548
Since it's your neighborhood, I was hoping

45
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,007
we might run into each other

46
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:37,842
And we actually did meet like this

47
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:38,677
How strange

48
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:41,137
Did we connect somehow?

49
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:44,682
You're still counting your chickens before they hatch

50
00:03:49,186 --> 00:03:49,813
Who?

51
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:54,860
Exactly what it looks like

52
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:58,530
Oh, did it already come to that?

53
00:03:59,655 --> 00:04:00,447
Hello

54
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,534
This is someone I've known for a long time, Iseop

55
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,369
I'm Lee Hyeonuk

56
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:06,829
Ah, yes...

57
00:04:09,373 --> 00:04:10,416
As you can see...

58
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,418
I'm Kim Wootae

59
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:19,175
Seems like a lot has changed since we last saw each other?

60
00:04:20,092 --> 00:04:21,635
I want to talk to you for a moment

61
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:23,429
Do you have time now?

62
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,891
I'm a bit busy right now

63
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:27,349
Really?

64
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:30,811
Then give me your number

65
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:32,480
It seems like your number changed

66
00:04:35,983 --> 00:04:36,775
Don't tell me you

67
00:04:36,775 --> 00:04:38,320
changed your number because of me

68
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:39,528
Right?

69
00:04:43,282 --> 00:04:44,159
Exactly!

70
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,579
Between ex-lovers, so pathetically...

71
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:50,498
Is there something you want to talk about separately?

72
00:04:50,998 --> 00:04:52,000
Hyung, let's go

73
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,384
Walk naturally

74
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,135
Let's go naturally

75
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:10,226
You can stop now

76
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:11,394
Ah, yes

77
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,731
Is that the person you met before?

78
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,610
I could tell immediately from hyung's expression

79
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,780
It seemed like even if you wanted to avoid it, you couldn't

80
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:23,447
I interfered a bit

81
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:29,329
Uh, but that person

82
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,579
was too shameless

83
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:31,706
Kind of

84
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,625
Just by looking, he's obviously a bad guy type, right?

85
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:34,960
No, it's his face, his face

86
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,835
Is it fun for you?

87
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:38,295
What?

88
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,048
I'll handle my own business

89
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,969
Don't talk like you know everything just because you know a little

90
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,177
Ah...

91
00:05:45,177 --> 00:05:46,762
Yes, I'm sorry

92
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:56,481
Why is everything so good, sorry, and easy for you?

93
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,817
People should show a bit that they dislike something

94
00:05:59,025 --> 00:05:59,733
Get upset and stuff

95
00:05:59,733 --> 00:06:01,735
So they won't see you as a pushover

96
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:06,240
I even held your hand first

97
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,659
What do you have to be sorry about?

98
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,911
People...

99
00:06:10,577 --> 00:06:12,579
You should live saying what you think

100
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:13,748
Just because you treat everyone nicely

101
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:14,873
Not everyone is like you

102
00:06:14,873 --> 00:06:16,208
You only get hurt

103
00:06:18,085 --> 00:06:20,463
But it's like a lottery

104
00:06:23,215 --> 00:06:23,925
What?

105
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,679
One of them turns out to be good

106
00:06:28,762 --> 00:06:30,347
If you treat ten people well

107
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:31,974
One of them

108
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:33,851
treats me sincerely

109
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:39,565
Instead of expressing my feelings

110
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,192
and creating uncomfortable situations

111
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,820
I prefer to handle things nicely

112
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,947
and blame myself, it's more comfortable

113
00:06:46,947 --> 00:06:49,409
Even if it seems stupid, what can you do

114
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,411
A person I didn't know at all

115
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,121
A hyung who ran over worried I might die

116
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,664
I don't think you're a bad person

117
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:56,875
Rather, I think you're a good person

118
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,918
That's why I helped you

119
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,215
If I thought it was meddling

120
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,257
I'm sorry

121
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:07,927
I'll be going now

122
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,155
One of them turns out to be good

123
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:31,076
If you treat ten people well

124
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,577
One of them

125
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,286
treats me sincerely

126
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:35,996
A person I didn't know at all

127
00:07:35,996 --> 00:07:37,414
A hyung who ran over worried I might die

128
00:07:37,664 --> 00:07:39,250
I don't think you're a bad person

129
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,460
Rather, I think you're a good person

130
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,509
Why are you so good with words too?

131
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:08,278
[I was too harsh with my words earlier. Sorry...]

132
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,618
[What are you doing?]

133
00:08:17,204 --> 00:08:20,625
[Oh, you read it right away?]
[Were you going to apologize to me?]

134
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,716
You're like a ghost

135
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,015
[Yeah]

136
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:46,400
Hello?

137
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:48,987
Huh?

138
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:50,947
Now?

139
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,493
I'm going out
