1
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:08,090
Waiting for someone?

2
00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:14,681
What brings you here?

3
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:17,351
I don't even have your number

4
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,186
To see you, I have to come find you directly

5
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:24,608
Should we go inside and talk?

6
00:00:25,733 --> 00:00:26,610
No

7
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,235
Let's talk here

8
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:34,952
I was pretty harsh that time, wasn't I?

9
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,913
But I had no choice either

10
00:00:39,246 --> 00:00:41,375
If I didn't cut you off like that

11
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:43,835
I wouldn't have been able to leave

12
00:00:44,835 --> 00:00:46,003
Even after 4 years together

13
00:00:46,003 --> 00:00:48,048
It wasn't easy breaking up like that

14
00:00:49,423 --> 00:00:51,175
In case you misunderstood

15
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,304
I don't really want to hear that story

16
00:00:55,262 --> 00:00:56,514
I'm fine now

17
00:00:57,014 --> 00:00:58,516
I don't really care about you

18
00:01:00,851 --> 00:01:01,769
Why?

19
00:01:02,728 --> 00:01:03,813
Because of him?

20
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,534
He didn't seem like your type

21
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:17,034
Are you just playing around with him?

22
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:19,996
Even so

23
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:22,289
Do I have to tell you about it?

24
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:25,043
What does that have to do with you?

25
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,295
You're feeling guilty

26
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:29,673
Thinking you hurt me

27
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:31,717
Afraid you might mess up some innocent person

28
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,760
Like you did to me

29
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:39,306
Hey...

30
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:41,768
You still think

31
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,353
you're someone special

32
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:45,563
What are you going to do?

33
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:46,898
You got it wrong

34
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:50,318
I'm not as shameless as you

35
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:52,737
I don't have a hobby of messing people up

36
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:56,992
Then what

37
00:01:58,242 --> 00:01:59,952
Do you really like him?

38
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:08,170
Huh?

39
00:02:09,253 --> 00:02:10,297
Do you like him?

40
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,215
No

41
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:15,760
He's just nothing

42
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:21,891
Then what's the problem

43
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,394
I came back

44
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:26,521
You're here

45
00:02:27,521 --> 00:02:29,106
But where am I?

46
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:32,152
I'm not here

47
00:02:34,528 --> 00:02:35,947
Ever since you abandoned me that time

48
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:37,907
I'm not here, I'm empty

49
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,242
You're asking who I like now?

50
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:42,871
Am I even capable of that?

51
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:45,414
I don't know anymore

52
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,543
I'm scared to be sincere with anyone

53
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:51,088
I don't want anyone close to me

54
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,215
Okay

55
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,382
Then I'll help you

56
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,677
So you can go back to how you were before

57
00:02:58,762 --> 00:02:59,471
Huh?

58
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:22,744
Don't make me laugh

59
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:25,413
It's not a spot you left empty for me to fill

60
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:26,664
You...

61
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,251
You're not in my options anymore

62
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,335
We were together for 4 years

63
00:03:31,335 --> 00:03:32,963
Is this really how it ends?

64
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:35,840
Seop...

65
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,425
Even if we had been together for another 4 years

66
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:38,717
It would have ended anyway

67
00:03:39,635 --> 00:03:40,594
I just...

68
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:43,181
I'm satisfied knowing I had

69
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,807
someone I loved with all my heart

70
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:46,059
So Hyeonwook

71
00:03:50,938 --> 00:03:51,940
Take care

72
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,652
Like you've been doing

73
00:03:58,445 --> 00:03:59,530
Seop

74
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:08,414
Have I ever properly told you

75
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,960
that I was sorry?

76
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,010
I was sorry

77
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:23,722
Back then

78
00:04:49,121 --> 00:04:51,958
[Wootae: Sorry, I don't think I can make it today]

79
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,556
Sorry, we're not open yet

80
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:25,742
Aren't you going to drink with me?

81
00:05:26,742 --> 00:05:28,119
I have to organize the display

82
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,081
Ah

83
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:36,753
Did something happen yesterday?

84
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,215
No

85
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:45,219
But how did you know I was here?

86
00:05:47,554 --> 00:05:48,847
You... well...

87
00:05:48,847 --> 00:05:50,391
I saw your Instagram

88
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,519
How did you find my Instagram?

89
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:58,942
I know a few models

90
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,693
It wasn't hard to find you

91
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:03,737
Ah...

92
00:06:03,737 --> 00:06:05,072
I see

93
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,494
You must be busy, go ahead

94
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,746
I'll just have coffee and go

95
00:06:12,871 --> 00:06:13,498
Yeah

96
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:35,103
I feel bad

97
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,813
Because of hyung

98
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:38,815
Huh?

99
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,777
I actually went to your place yesterday

100
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,239
I saw the whole conversation with that guy

101
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:48,867
Ah...

102
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:50,952
So...

103
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:53,246
No, I...

104
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:54,748
After hearing that conversation

105
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,750
I have no idea why I feel this way

106
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,336
That story about me being nothing to you

107
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:02,880
Why does it annoy me and make me so angry

108
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:06,967
It's so ridiculous and infuriating

109
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,385
Kim Wootae

110
00:07:08,385 --> 00:07:09,054
It's absurd

111
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,306
How long have we even known each other?

112
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:15,059
This just feels really strange

113
00:07:15,684 --> 00:07:17,103
and confusing to me

114
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:21,815
I like that you came to see me

115
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,527
But when I see you smiling without knowing how I feel

116
00:07:25,527 --> 00:07:26,862
it bothers me

117
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:36,748
I'm sorry

118
00:07:37,706 --> 00:07:38,958
I think I got caught up

119
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,501
in strange thoughts

120
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:44,213
Just pretend you didn't hear anything

121
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,675
Yesterday

122
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:53,764
I actually excluded you because I was conscious of you

123
00:07:58,394 --> 00:07:59,603
Without realizing it...

124
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,273
Because I kept thinking about you

125
00:08:03,148 --> 00:08:04,983
It was a defense mechanism

126
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:07,612
This kind of talk

127
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,032
Might be too much of a burden for you

128
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:14,828
Like you said, when have we even met?

129
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,622
Then...

130
00:08:18,288 --> 00:08:19,998
Did you think about me?

131
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,961
I did

132
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,130
What kind of thoughts?

133
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,384
Kissing you

134
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:32,595
Looking into your eyes and talking

135
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,181
Wondering if you'd think about me too

136
00:08:37,182 --> 00:08:39,101
But even if I think that way

137
00:08:40,185 --> 00:08:43,064
You probably don't see me like that at all

138
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:47,068
To you, I'm nothing

139
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,904
Just some hyung you know

140
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:56,911
Sorry

141
00:08:57,619 --> 00:08:59,456
For thinking about you that way

142
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,583
I won't come looking for you again

143
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:08,881
Close your eyes for 5 seconds

144
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,507
Huh?

145
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,177
Just 5 seconds

146
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:35,658
I'm telling you it's really strange

147
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:37,827
You...

148
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,329
This is my first time with something like this

149
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:41,663
It's really strange

150
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,001
I keep wanting to do things like this with you

151
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:47,921
I think I like you

152
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:52,759
Seems like it

153
00:09:54,801 --> 00:09:56,095
What kind of answer is that?

154
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,180
What about you?

155
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:58,597
What about you?

156
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,350
I already told you

157
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,145
That I keep thinking about you too

158
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,485
Me too...

159
00:10:12,694 --> 00:10:14,279
Can I like you?

160
00:10:16,448 --> 00:10:17,449
What's that supposed to mean?

161
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,791
This time it won't end in 5 seconds
