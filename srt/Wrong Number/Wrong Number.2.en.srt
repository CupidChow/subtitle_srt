1
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,949
I'm really sorry about yesterday

2
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:36,536
I'm not usually the type who

3
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,371
makes mistakes when drinking

4
00:00:39,246 --> 00:00:41,166
but yesterday I drank too much

5
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:47,338
Forty-five thousand won

6
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:49,132
Excuse me?

7
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,302
The bill from that bar yesterday

8
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:53,594
I was completely out of it

9
00:00:53,594 --> 00:00:54,762
so I paid and left

10
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:56,472
Oh, yes!

11
00:00:56,472 --> 00:00:58,141
I'll transfer it right away

12
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,898
Oh, by any chance yesterday...

13
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,233
nothing else special happened, right?

14
00:01:10,152 --> 00:01:11,362
What kind of thing?

15
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,367
Well, yesterday

16
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:17,159
I don't remember very well

17
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,204
I clearly remember calling you

18
00:01:20,204 --> 00:01:22,039
after drinking yesterday

19
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,626
but when I woke up in the morning

20
00:01:25,626 --> 00:01:27,211
I was undressed

21
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:30,548
and you were hugging me tightly

22
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,429
So maybe...

23
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:42,309
Do I look desperate?

24
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:44,271
Excuse me?

25
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,606
In your eyes

26
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,190
do I look so desperate that I'd

27
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,483
sleep with just anyone?

28
00:01:53,112 --> 00:01:54,030
No

29
00:02:16,385 --> 00:02:17,344
Phew

30
00:02:17,344 --> 00:02:18,512
Hold me...

31
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:20,389
Hold me

32
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,994
I just wanted to sleep

33
00:02:42,244 --> 00:02:42,913
What?

34
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,456
But you kept bothering me

35
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:46,083
so I had no choice but to tie you up and sleep

36
00:02:49,126 --> 00:02:50,878
I'm really sorry about everything

37
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,260
How long has it been since you broke up?

38
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:01,264
About a month

39
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,894
Well, it's not like I don't understand how hard it is

40
00:03:07,561 --> 00:03:08,813
but still, you shouldn't say

41
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:09,898
you want to die so easily

42
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,902
I'm going to drop the formalities

43
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:16,695
since you seem younger than me

44
00:03:17,905 --> 00:03:18,907
Ah, okay hyung

45
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,117
Sit comfortably

46
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,034
Yes

47
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:29,376
If you really thought about dying, you should do it quietly

48
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,753
without anyone knowing, planning it thoroughly

49
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,045
and executing it

50
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,713
If you threaten others saying you'll die

51
00:03:34,713 --> 00:03:36,257
you just become an easy person

52
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:38,425
Even when you go, you should

53
00:03:38,425 --> 00:03:39,760
remain as a cool person, shouldn't you?

54
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,186
I'm kidding

55
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,398
If you want to die

56
00:03:52,773 --> 00:03:54,608
stay busy enough to die

57
00:03:56,485 --> 00:03:59,405
Then this emotion will become dull

58
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:01,574
and memories will become hazy

59
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,704
Hazy memories don't have much power

60
00:04:07,496 --> 00:04:09,623
They just naturally get forgotten

61
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,710
without trying

62
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:20,467
Why?

63
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:24,264
Hyung, my stomach...

64
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:25,472
What?

65
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:27,516
Oh wait, wait!

66
00:04:27,516 --> 00:04:29,519
The bathroom is over there! Over there!

67
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:51,541
Go

68
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:54,543
Hey hyung

69
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,007
Um...

70
00:05:00,007 --> 00:05:01,760
Can I call you?

71
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:05,096
No

72
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:06,431
Don't do it

73
00:05:07,264 --> 00:05:08,349
If you do, you die

74
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:10,644
Okay

75
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:15,398
Maybe at least your name?

76
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:36,418
Yes, are you coming?

77
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:38,463
What?

78
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:42,007
If you say that now

79
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:44,469
Yes

80
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:45,804
Someone else is coming as a replacement?

81
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,474
I understand

82
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:50,849
Yes

83
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:05,824
Writer Choi Iseop?

84
00:06:07,157 --> 00:06:09,244
I came as a replacement model...

85
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,704
I'm Kim Wootae

86
00:06:19,211 --> 00:06:22,173
This is the concept for this shoot

87
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,217
Rather than poses or actions

88
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,552
emotional expression is important, so close-up...

89
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,137
Oh, you're a photographer

90
00:06:28,512 --> 00:06:30,347
Hyung, but

91
00:06:30,514 --> 00:06:32,434
is this studio rented?

92
00:06:33,809 --> 00:06:35,311
It's not personally owned, right?

93
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:37,896
I originally started this

94
00:06:37,896 --> 00:06:39,523
as a part-time job

95
00:06:40,065 --> 00:06:41,608
but somehow work kept coming in

96
00:06:41,608 --> 00:06:42,652
so I'm doing it now

97
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:45,112
But

98
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:47,114
Oh, but how do we meet like this?

99
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,615
Isn't it really amazing?

100
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:50,744
I originally today

101
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,077
when I got the replacement offer

102
00:06:52,536 --> 00:06:54,039
I was planning to rest today

103
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:55,414
But

104
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:56,416
you said

105
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,001
to stay busy enough to die

106
00:06:58,543 --> 00:06:59,960
And we meet like this

107
00:07:01,503 --> 00:07:02,713
Oh, right hyung

108
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:04,048
speak comfortably to me

109
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,800
Please take care of me today

110
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,295
Going to drink again?

111
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:45,590
No

112
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,340
I

113
00:07:46,673 --> 00:07:48,134
will drink water

114
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:52,554
Since we met again like this, it's fate

115
00:07:52,554 --> 00:07:54,181
it would be a shame to just part ways

116
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,393
Come on, cheers

117
00:07:57,434 --> 00:07:58,603
Cheers

118
00:08:05,025 --> 00:08:07,945
How did the photos turn out?

119
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:11,115
Since I don't have much experience yet

120
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:12,242
I've always been curious

121
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,078
Do I look too...

122
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,203
amateur?

123
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:18,206
Yeah

124
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:22,710
I like that you're honest, hyung

125
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:23,795
Ah

126
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,590
Can I call you hyung?

127
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:30,510
Or should I say photographer?

128
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,095
Whatever you want

129
00:08:33,637 --> 00:08:35,055
Okay, hyung

130
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,520
But hyung, don't you date?

131
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,855
You look like you'd be really popular

132
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:43,730
Right?

133
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:44,899
You're popular, right?

134
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,278
Well, it's not like there's nothing

135
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:50,154
I knew it

136
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:52,157
Then what about now? Are you single?

137
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:55,659
Why?

138
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,328
Going to introduce me to a girl?

139
00:08:58,912 --> 00:09:01,707
Oh, but I don't know many girls either

140
00:09:01,957 --> 00:09:03,835
What type do you like, hyung?

141
00:09:12,676 --> 00:09:13,720
I...

142
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,139
like men

143
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,434
Ah

144
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:21,895
I see

145
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:23,354
I'm leaving

146
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,652
I don't mind

147
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,826
Actually, there aren't people like that around me

148
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,994
so I never really thought about it

149
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,748
But people liking people, what's wrong with that?

150
00:09:43,248 --> 00:09:44,542
There's no reason why we can't

151
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:45,585
be friends, right?

152
00:09:52,841 --> 00:09:54,511
You...

153
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:56,136
weren't really thinking of dying, were you?

154
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,349
You were just being reckless, right?

155
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,770
You're right

156
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,480
Why did I do that then?

157
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:09,817
Good thing you answered

158
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,487
If Jiyoung had really answered...

159
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,365
I would be really embarrassed to death right now

160
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,034
I understand

161
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:21,496
I understand one hundred percent

162
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,791
How can you understand me, hyung?

163
00:10:25,582 --> 00:10:28,293
Have you ever loved someone to death too?

164
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:33,841
A cool guy like you, hyung?

165
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,385
You probably would have just

166
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,679
said bye coolly

167
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,140
I've had that experience too

168
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,603
Loving someone to death

169
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:52,234
I also screamed that I'd die, threatened

170
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:54,487
cried and acted pathetically

171
00:10:57,364 --> 00:10:59,408
I really thought the world was ending

172
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:04,956
Don't go

173
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,583
I miss you

174
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,310
Why am I being like this again?

175
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,730
Hyung...

176
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,024
Are you okay?

177
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,193
I should go sober up a bit

178
00:11:38,238 --> 00:11:38,948
Hyung

179
00:11:39,489 --> 00:11:41,033
Are you okay, hyung?

180
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:46,831
Are you okay?

181
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,127
I missed you

182
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:01,679
No, hyung

183
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,640
This right now...

184
00:12:05,557 --> 00:12:07,100
Whoever you are

185
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,645
I don't care
