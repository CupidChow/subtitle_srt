ARROWS IN POSSESSION

2
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,612
So you can't go over.

3
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:34,784
And…

4
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,706
There are actual walls here.

5
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:42,167
If there are walls, we can't get them.

6
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:45,170
Damn, these walls…

7
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:48,882
Shit.

8
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:50,633
-Can't we do the blue one?
-Not going to line up?

9
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,093
But I need to borrow one from you.

10
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,387
-Then you just do the blue one first.
-Yes.

11
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:55,847
-You can use this one.
-Can I?

12
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,307
-Yeah, go ahead.
-See you in a bit.

13
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,767
Okay. Let's go. Quickly.

14
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:01,644
Oh, here it is.

15
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:06,399
Would you like to stop exploring
and open the box?

16
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:07,734
Yes, I will open the box.

17
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:10,236
-I will show you the box.
-I have no choice.

18
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,488
Please check inside.

19
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:17,452
A CLUE TO REACH THE PURPLE BOX

20
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,415
You have 30 seconds left.

21
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,959
I will collect these arrows.

22
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,753
Would you like to continue exploring?

23
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:29,798
I will do this and explore.

24
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:31,299
-Would you like to see the sky blue box?
-Yes.

25
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:33,176
I will collect your arrow.

26
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:35,303
Please check inside.

27
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:38,723
THE RED AND ORANGE BOXES
DO NOT CONTAIN THE TREASURE

28
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:41,309
THE CLUES YOU SAW IN THOSE BOXES
WILL HELP YOU

29
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,230
7high, please leave the dealer room.

30
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:48,066
Hey, we're screwed.

31
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:48,983
Why?

32
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,735
7high just said they were screwed.

33
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,070
You can't go through walls.

34
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:54,030
You can't go through?

35
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,157
They are actual dividers.

36
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,617
Damn it.

37
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,329
So it's in 3D.

38
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,290
Like this.

39
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:07,669
It has to touch the red dot on the board.

40
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:11,798
It has to start and end on a red dot.

41
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:13,091
Darn it, the wall…

42
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:19,472
You have 1 minute and 30 seconds left.

43
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:20,557
Okay.

44
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:29,607
Can I get anything else?

45
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:31,609
Darn it, these 3D walls.

46
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,029
I just hope they fail
and don't find anything.

47
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:39,033
Regardless, we don't have anything
to open the high-value ones.

48
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:42,871
I found one.

49
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,623
Oh, sweet.

50
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,667
-Would you like to stop exploring?
-Yes.

51
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,918
I will now open the box.

52
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,297
A CLUE TO REACH THE RED BOX

53
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,508
"PART OF THE ARROW SHOULD BE ABOVE,
AND PART BELOW"

54
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,927
Son Eun-yu, please leave the dealer room.

55
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,137
All right.

56
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:03,933
Please proceed with exploring.

57
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:06,311
First, like this.

58
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,355
Would you like to stop exploring
and open the box?

59
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,899
Yes, I would.

60
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,692
THE RED AND ORANGE BOXES
DO NOT CONTAIN THE TREASURE

61
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,652
THE CLUES YOU SAW IN THOSE BOXES
WILL HELP YOU

62
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,446
-Would you like to keep exploring?
-Yes.

63
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:22,410
It must start
from the red end of the arrow.

64
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,080
Just a moment.

65
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,585
Is this possible?

66
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:33,421
Both ends always
have to be touching a red dot.

67
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,547
Understood.

68
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,799
Please proceed with exploring.

69
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,513
How do I do this…

70
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,808
How did I do this?

71
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,561
If I do it like this…

72
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,445
Can I do it like this?

73
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:58,529
That is not possible.

74
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:02,367
The ends of the arrow have to
be touching the red dots on the board.

75
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:06,412
First, I'll do this.

76
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,039
-Would you like to open the box?
-Yes.

77
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:09,958
Please check inside.

78
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:22,553
I'll do this.

79
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:23,930
-Would you like to open the box?
-Yes.

80
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,890
I will now open the green box.

81
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:27,600
Please check inside.

82
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,230
You have one minute left.

83
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:38,319
Okay, I'm done.

84
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:39,862
Would you like to stop exploring?

85
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:41,281
Yes.

86
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:42,824
-I have important news.
-What?

87
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:44,284
I opened the pink box.

88
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,201
How?

89
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,245
I must have amazing spatial perception.

90
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:48,705
-Did you figure it out there?
-Yes.

91
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,123
And it landed on pink.

92
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,041
Just by trying things?

93
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,252
Yes. If I have my arrows,
I can make it again.

94
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,214
I'm done.

95
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,216
-Would you like to open the pink box?
-Yes.

96
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,802
"PART OF THE ARROW SHOULD BE ABOVE,
AND PART BELOW"

97
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,470
Okay, got it.

98
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:07,724
The pink box says
"Part above and part below."

99
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,392
-Did you open the pink one then?
-Yes.

100
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:12,437
In order to get the red box,
partially above and partially below.

101
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,397
"Part above and part below."

102
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,482
-Surely, that must be about the arrow?
-Right.

103
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,775
Why say something so obvious?

104
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,403
Maybe it's about arrows like this.

105
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,738
But they're all like that.

106
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:26,159
ARROWS IN POSSESSION

107
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,293
I'm done.

108
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:36,669
-Would you like to open the box?
-Yes.

109
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,463
I will now show you the blue box.

110
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:39,797
Please check inside.

111
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:44,844
A CLUE TO REACH THE ORANGE BOX

112
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:48,723
-Would you like to stop exploring?
-Yes, I would.

113
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:53,811
What was that?

114
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,607
-I found a clue.
-What?

115
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,359
The way to get to the orange box.

116
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:03,738
You know the Pythagorean theorem?
Three, four, five? That's all there was.

117
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:04,947
Three, four, five?

118
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,283
Wow, it's real water.

119
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,285
But how do you get to this one here?

120
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:14,457
First, I will get
the basic one out of courtesy.

121
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,876
Would you like to stop exploring
and open the box?

122
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,754
-Yes, and then I'll do the rest.
-Yes, that's possible.

123
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:21,297
Please check inside the box.

124
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,343
"The red and orange boxes
do not contain the treasure."

125
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:27,804
No treasure. So no treasure in there.

126
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,306
"However, when you move
toward the treasure chest…"

127
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,725
Oh man, I was just…

128
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,560
The orange one is absolutely no joke.

129
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,145
There's no way to get there.

130
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:38,815
-Have you finished checking?
-Yes.

131
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,818
The clues may be helpful…

132
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,736
You have 1 minute and 30 seconds left.

133
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,198
I won't open the green one just yet.

134
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:48,491
Then this one…

135
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,452
goes like this.

136
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:54,831
And I'll do this.

137
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:55,957
You have one minute left.

138
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,916
I'm done.

139
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:58,668
Would you like to stop exploring
and open the pink box?

140
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,128
-Yes, please.
-I will show you.

141
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:01,921
What did you see?

142
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:03,673
I saw a clue about the purple box.

143
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,883
It said the way to get there is like this.

144
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:06,968
It was a picture?

145
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:09,470
Yeah, it was a picture.
It showed two shapes like this.

146
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:13,015
-Is there a shape like that?
-No, it's not that.

147
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,892
It means you can arrange arrows like this.

148
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,812
It's exactly this. That's what it means.

149
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,023
Well spotted.

150
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:24,110
Now we have an opportunity.
So that's what it was.

151
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:26,487
-That's the hidden workaround.
-That's right.

152
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:30,116
There was a five…

153
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,706
Hey, can't we go like this?

154
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,459
-Right? So, instead of like this…
-From where to where?

155
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:40,710
Go diagonally?

156
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,962
Just lay it down.
Wouldn't that be the right length?

157
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:44,088
That's right.

158
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,423
It goes like this.

159
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,633
It has to go like this.
That's what it's talking about, right?

160
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,261
-Must be.
-It's three, four, five.

161
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:52,096
If the length matches? Okay!

162
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,390
-In a straight line!
-If it fits inside 3-4-5…

163
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,435
If it fits inside 3-4-5,
we can place it like this.

164
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:58,478
That's it!

165
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,730
-So we can put this one this way instead?
-Exactly.

166
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,482
You're a genius. You're right.

167
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:03,983
We must try it.
We need to get some points.

168
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:05,026
You do it.

169
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:06,068
Should I go try?

170
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,320
Yeah, off you go.

171
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,866
Hello. Oh, so this is what it feels like.

172
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:14,744
But is there an arrow that fits in a 3x4?

173
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,287
We need to find it. I think it's this one.

174
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,831
-Four, three.
-Right, this is the only one.

175
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,334
On the next turn,
we're all getting one of these.

176
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,127
Then we can use this for the orange box.

177
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,047
First,

178
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,216
I will do this.

179
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,800
Would you like to stop exploring
and open the box?

180
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,511
-Yes.
-Please check inside.

181
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,181
Yes. Red, orange, okay.

182
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,646
Would you like to stop exploring
and open the box?

183
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,147
-Yes.
-Please check inside.

184
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,608
LET´S TRY TO FIND WHERE EACH
COLORED BOX (A TOTAL OF 10) IS LOCATED

185
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,068
Okay.

186
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:48,819
-Are you done checking?
-Yes.

187
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,405
Please proceed with exploring.

188
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,286
-Would you like to stop?
-Yes.

189
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,586
Would you like to stop exploring?

190
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:07,922
Did nothing happen?

191
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:10,091
Nothing happened.

192
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:11,217
Thank you.

193
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:12,969
I…

194
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,597
I would like to stop exploring.

195
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,308
I will collect your arrow.

196
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:25,523
Did nothing happen when I landed here?

197
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:26,732
Nothing happened.

198
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,693
I would like to stop exploring.

199
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:32,697
But was it a mistake to go all-in?
I'm starting to feel like that's the case.

200
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,283
Now that we've seen the clues,
it seems so. That's okay though.

201
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,618
The arrows we need
might be completely different now.

202
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,287
So, what's our plan now?

203
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,497
First, I'll figure out
the solution for purple.

204
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,165
-Okay.
-Because I have this clue.

205
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,547
I just realized I have…

206
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,631
Since I didn't play this…

207
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,341
I'm… I'm done.

208
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:56,429
No, Justin. To get 20 points,
you can just get four 5-pointers.

209
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:57,763
That will get you to 20.

210
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,849
But how do I get another five points?

211
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,183
There are four rounds of exploration.

212
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:04,270
-You're not done. Wait. Really.
-Wait.

213
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:06,439
The thing is, Justin has to get 25 points.

214
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:08,608
So, he has to target a 15-pointer.

215
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,527
Now that I've seen it for myself,
it's completely intuitive.

216
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,529
-Did you get the basic box?
-I did.

217
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,447
Tell me.

218
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,741
There is no treasure
in the red or orange boxes.

219
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:19,910
However, the method
you use to get there will be helpful

220
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,038
in reaching the treasure chest.

221
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,539
It was "above and below," right?

222
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,750
-What? The red one? Yes.
-Yes.

223
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:26,792
What could it mean?

224
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,503
So we need to figure out
how to get to the red one.

225
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,547
So what does it mean
to go "above and below?"

226
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:35,468
What I'm wondering is,
can we use this in 3D?

227
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:38,304
-Isn't it like this? Using them in 3D?
-To get across!

228
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,556
-We use them vertically to cross over.
-Is that allowed?

229
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:43,225
That's how it works!

230
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,895
I don't know. Just now, I… I see.

231
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,315
That must be right. That's how you do it.

232
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:51,525
Underneath the water.
With the one that Tinno took with him.

233
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,319
The board was 3D, so…

234
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:56,405
Then, in the next round,
let's check the points situation,

235
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,200
get points for people that need them,
get across the board, and try to end it.

236
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:00,826
That's insane.

237
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:04,205
-Tinno, we got it.
-It's over.

238
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:07,416
-It's over.
-You know how the board is 3D?

239
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,460
-Keep it down.
-We go straight through here.

240
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:12,088
There's water, right?
We can go across the water.

241
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,840
-Isn't that insane?
-Kyuhyun, we're gonna win.

242
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,843
Here are the points of each player.

243
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,805
Why do they have so many points?

244
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:21,931
Ten, ten, ten.

245
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:27,019
All players will be given
an additional basic arrow.

246
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,187
Kang Ji-yeong.

247
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,189
Thank you.

248
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:32,149
Tinno, I will return your arrows.

249
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,317
Thank you.

250
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,528
-This time, we'll get the orange.
-Yes.

251
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:38,531
-Let's decide who will get orange.
-Orange and also red.

252
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:40,991
Only I figured out the orange one.
Let's do it this time.

253
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,119
-Yoon So-hui.
-Thank you.

254
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:46,789
Justin, let's figure out
what you can get with that.

255
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,207
We can't do the auctions anymore.

256
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,876
I cannot believe that it didn't work.

257
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,462
-I risked everything for that.
-What did you end up doing?

258
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:58,092
The arrow auction of Round 5
will now begin.

259
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:00,594
So-hui got 12 points, right?
How did she get them?

260
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:01,679
She opened the blue one.

261
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:05,349
The ones that haven't been opened
are the 15-pointers and the white one.

262
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:08,269
-I'm really curious about this.
-Me too.

263
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:10,980
This is the only information they have
that we don't.

264
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,441
They went all-in,
so they don't have any chips left.

265
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:14,692
We can get it this time.

266
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:18,279
Tinno, please enter the auction booth.

267
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:21,449
Tinno, how many chips
would you like to bid?

268
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:22,533
Just one, please.

269
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:24,952
-You have bid one chip.
-Yes.

270
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:27,121
-I will bid three.
-You have bid three chips.

271
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,539
Justin and I have no chips left.

272
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:30,541
-You don't have any?
-I went all-in before.

273
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:32,209
I have to play with what I have.

274
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,878
How many should I bid?

275
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,755
Do you have nine? Then go with eight

276
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:38,507
and save one for the next round
to get anything you can.

277
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,468
Eight or nine won't make
much difference right now.

278
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:41,761
I will bid eight.

279
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,846
Yes, please put eight chips in.

280
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,974
But we have to do this quickly
so we can tell Ji-yeong what to do.

281
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:49,685
We're trying to find diagonals now. Quick.

282
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,771
So, the exploration round is
right after the auction.

283
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,898
Are we going to get the orange
then go for red?

284
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:56,317
Aren't you looking for a way
to get to red? Still figuring out.

285
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,319
-This is three, four, five.
-Yes.

286
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:00,654
No matter what you do,
this length here is five,

287
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:03,949
so I think it should be like this,
since the length is what matters.

288
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,619
But you can't go through this.
Can we just go over the wall?

289
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:08,454
Hang on, the wall was one space.

290
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:11,957
Can't we do it like this?
Wedge it in like a hook.

291
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,834
So, do it like this from here?

292
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,836
I think it will work if you put it right.

293
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,546
Yes, it has to go from this side.

294
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,216
Okay, this is mine. I'll get the red one.

295
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,258
Okay.

296
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:24,261
I know what I'm supposed to do,
but it isn't easy.

297
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,346
What do I bring this time?

298
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:26,889
Bidding? Just bid half of what you have.

299
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,766
They don't have many Pieces, so just half.

300
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:29,975
I will bid five.

301
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,685
Okay, please put five in the box.

302
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:32,937
All-in. I will bid one.

303
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,647
Yes, please put one in.

304
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,273
Kyuhyun, please put one in.

305
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:39,860
Here are the results of the arrow auction.

306
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:40,986
What should I get?

307
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,823
This is driving me crazy.

308
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,496
As of now,

309
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:55,876
I'm planning by myself for
So-hui and Kyuhyun to take some points.

310
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,004
I'm thinking of setting up the board

311
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:02,424
so that So-hui and Kyuhyun
can use the best moves.

312
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:03,551
I've done it.

313
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:04,969
-What?
-All of it.

314
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,011
-Who?
-Me.

315
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,972
-You take it.
-How?

316
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,682
Go straight like this,

317
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:10,933
then one,

318
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,017
then this.

319
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,228
-Are you saying to get purple?
-Yes.

320
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:15,813
-So with this one, right?
-Right.

321
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:16,897
Is that side open?

322
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:17,898
There's no wall here.

323
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:18,983
-There isn't?
-No.

324
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,443
-Oh, the water is open.
-Yes.

325
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,821
-What do you need?
-I need two basic ones

326
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:25,281
and the long basic one we just got.

327
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:28,033
-One of these.
-So you go like this and like this.

328
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,952
And lay this one down from here to here…

329
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,538
-Using this?
-…since its length is five.

330
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,915
But how do we get the white one?

331
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,084
You just need this one
to get the white one.

332
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:38,711
-With this in one go?
-Yes, in one go.

333
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:42,047
Kang Ji-yeong, please choose your arrow.

334
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,382
What should I get?

335
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,426
Don't we need this one?

336
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:47,970
Go with another one of these?
Wait, there's only one.

337
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,848
I tried it earlier.
It's not as useful as I thought.

338
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,558
You can go to green with it.

339
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,018
Did you get the green one?

340
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:56,020
-No, not yet.
-Exactly, you didn't get green yet.

341
00:14:58,606 --> 00:14:59,982
I'll take this one.

342
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,400
Let me affix a nametag.

343
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,193
-Please choose your arrow.
-This one?

344
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:04,904
-Let me affix a nametag.
-Sure.

345
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,488
-Please take it.
-Okay.

346
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,073
You may take it.

347
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:09,867
I'll take this one.

348
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,369
I choose number five.

349
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:15,956
7high, please choose your arrow.

350
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,253
My goodness.

351
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,047
We learned our lesson.

352
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,757
You guys were lining up here last time.

353
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,216
-We're following suit.
-We saw you do it.

354
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,593
Oh, well.

355
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:31,305
The arrow auction of Round 5
has concluded.

356
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,683
The exploration of Round 6 will now begin

357
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,977
and last for the next 40 minutes.

358
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:57,289
I was so bewildered because
the method I'd been told didn't work.

359
00:15:58,165 --> 00:15:59,333
Why doesn't this work?

360
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,352
-Would you like to stop exploring?
-Yes.

361
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:20,145
I will now show you the orange box.

362
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:25,234
I thought I'd better do something
while I was in there,

363
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:28,570
so I changed the starting spot,
and I saw a way in which it was possible.

364
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,031
So I put it down, waited,

365
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,075
and looked at the dealer, and he said,

366
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,411
"I will open the box for you."
So ecstatic.

367
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:37,579
Please check inside.

368
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:41,125
YOU CAN REACH THE TREASURE CHEST
BY USING TWO IDENTICAL ARROWS

369
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,918
Yes, okay. Thank you.

370
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:45,796
-It's different.
-What?

371
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,214
It didn't work?

372
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:49,216
-But I found a different way.
-How?

373
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:50,134
-Did you do it?
-Yes.

374
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,760
Can I put it like this?

375
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:52,970
You may.

376
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,933
Oh, it doesn't reach.

377
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,686
I have to put it on the red,
so this isn't working.

378
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:02,104
What do I do now?

379
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,564
It didn't work.

380
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:04,773
Did it touch the wall?

381
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,483
Please proceed with exploring.

382
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:11,864
Is this allowed?

383
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,907
The red dot is only on the upper surface.

384
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,617
It doesn't work. Damn it.

385
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:19,621
I came in because Hyun-gyu said
this was definitely it,

386
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:20,664
but he was wrong.

387
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:22,624
Is this allowed?

388
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,752
It is not touching the red dot.

389
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,629
It has to be exactly on the dot, right?

390
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,339
Yes. You are now out of time.

391
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,842
-Did you do it?
-I didn't get it either. It was blocked.

392
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:36,597
Is this allowed?

393
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,973
It is not touching.

394
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,684
Would this be allowed?

395
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:43,103
No, the red dot is
only on the upper surface.

396
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,646
Damn, this isn't right.

397
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,192
-Wouldn't that work?
-Hang on.

398
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:50,819
One, two, three. Then do this, here.

399
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,489
If you do this, doesn't it work? It works.

400
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,240
-This bit here is open.
-Here?

401
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,785
It opens up like this.
Yeah, then that works.

402
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,244
Hang on, I'll go and try it.

403
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,790
What? You're still in line?

404
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,541
They're spending a lot of time thinking.

405
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,377
Jeong Hyun-gyu, your time is up.
Please leave the dealer room.

406
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:09,838
Did you do it?

407
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:11,965
You look grim.

408
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,303
Your expression…

409
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:18,764
He didn't find it.
He brought back all his arrows.

410
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:20,349
-What's wrong?
-I didn't get anything.

411
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,768
Hey, what the heck?
He didn't get it either.

412
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:25,437
-It doesn't reach.
-Nothing works, does it?

413
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,856
-Hey, so the ones we want to get…
-I didn't even get 5 points.

414
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,109
-What was written in the orange box?
-In the orange box?

415
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:33,862
You will need two identical arrows
to reach the target.

416
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,697
-Identical?
-Maybe two basic ones?

417
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,116
Hang on.

418
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,994
-No.
-One of them would lift up then.

419
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,454
That's why it doesn't work.

420
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,414
So, who got the white?

421
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:45,833
Hyun-joon's trying for it.

422
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,503
First, I will take the white one.

423
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:51,088
-Would you like to stop exploring?
-Yes.

424
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:52,881
Please check inside the box.

425
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,883
TO REACH THE RED, ORANGE, PURPLE BOXES,
BE CREATIVE WITH THE ARROWS

426
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,010
THE PINK, BLUE, YELLOW BOXES WILL HAVE
CLUES TO REACH THOSE BOXES

427
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,721
-Would you like to stop exploring?
-Yes.

428
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:01,557
Please check inside.

429
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,434
A CLUE TO REACH THE PURPLE BOX

430
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:07,980
Please proceed with exploring.

431
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:08,897
I will open this one.

432
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:09,982
Please check inside.

433
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,525
LET´S TRY TO FIND WHERE EACH
COLORED BOX (A TOTAL OF 10) IS LOCATED

434
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,070
Oh, this was dug out.

435
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,739
No wonder I didn't remember this bit.

436
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:20,534
This won't work, then.

437
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:23,704
Let me just ask one thing. Are these
not allowed to touch the water at all?

438
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:26,498
All arrows must start
and finish on a red dot.

439
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,041
I'll have to try this several times.

440
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:34,923
Shit.

441
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,467
Your time is up.
Please exit the dealer room.

442
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,513
-Did you find it?
-Nothing worked.

443
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,182
It's not even close to fitting.

444
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,934
-You know the yellow clue.
-What is it? Tell us.

445
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,478
You didn't know?
I thought everyone had opened it.

446
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:51,106
The yellow clue is a clue
for how to get to the purple box.

447
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,066
There was a picture that showed that

448
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:56,445
this needs to be rotated on a plane.
So obliquely like this.

449
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,113
Not a three-dimensional rotation.

450
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,407
-I've got a good feeling.
-Like that.

451
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:03,118
-I've got a feeling. I think it's this.
-You have to turn this.

452
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,287
You have to rotate this.

453
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,080
Hey.

454
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,083
Oh! I found it!

455
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,418
That's it!

456
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,214
It was here. Then to get here…

457
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:17,299
One, two, three, it's this. Two of these.

458
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:18,800
One, two. One, two. Okay.

459
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,969
Hang on, then Kyuhyun
should go to purple this time.

460
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,640
-Would you like to stop exploring?
-Yes.

461
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:27,809
TO REACH RED, ORANGE, PURPLE BOXES
BE CREATIVE WITH THE ARROWS

462
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:30,437
-I'll do this one. Yes.
-Would you like to stop exploring?

463
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,688
I'll show you the sky blue box.

464
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:32,940
Thank you.

465
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,360
-I will stop exploring here.
-Are you done?

466
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:37,945
Please check inside the box.

467
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,196
Thank you.

468
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,906
I just saw the white one. It said

469
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:44,618
to get to red, orange and purple,
we need to think creatively.

470
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:47,246
Right, so that's why
we haven't been able to solve them so far.

471
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,830
I think it's about a pair.

472
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,832
Yellow tells you how to get to purple.

473
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:54,544
And the pink one I just saw
was about how to get to red.

474
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,755
So blue must be
about how to get to orange.

475
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,551
-Would you like to open the box?
-Yes.

476
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:02,803
Please check inside.

477
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,098
Yes.

478
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:09,476
The exploration for Round 6
has now concluded.

479
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:12,688
Here are the points of each player.

480
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,231
Wow, Eun-yu has 27 points.

481
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:17,109
Eun-yu opened the pink one
and got another three, making 27.

482
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:21,405
If I don't get purple, I'm in big trouble.
They haven't opened purple, right?

483
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:22,656
We have to hope not.

484
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:24,825
I really hope they didn't find it.

485
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:26,285
Hopefully, Eun-yu hasn't.

486
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,828
I got it.

487
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,079
Tell us.

488
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:30,872
Quickly.

489
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:33,125
I figured purple out.
And we have what we need.

490
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,085
We can solve it with just these three.

491
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:38,422
Which one looks the most impossible? Red?

492
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:42,551
Yes. To get to red,
part is above and part is below.

493
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,177
It comes in like this.

494
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:48,015
There must be a really good clue
to the treasure chest in the red box.

495
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:50,434
The fences around the red box
are so frustrating.

496
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:52,602
I'm going to get red for sure this time.

497
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:01,903
-Oh, damn it. This is it.
-Did you find something?

498
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,530
-Okay, hurry and find it.
-This is it.

499
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:07,492
A straight line. It's a direct route.
Isn't it this one? The 4-spacer?

500
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,453
-Right. It's four spaces.
-Is this four?

501
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:11,955
There are the walls there.
You can't get through there.

502
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,999
-Oh, right, You can't.
-There are walls.

503
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:15,083
-Here…
-This works.

504
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:19,212
After doing this, if you put it like this,
it works, doesn't it?

505
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,631
If you go this way, that's it.

506
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:30,766
I'm curious about something.
The purple one.

507
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,142
Can one of these two open it?

508
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:33,477
You've got 29 points, right?

509
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,312
-Yes, 27 points.
-Just give it to them.

510
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:36,563
How many points do you have?

511
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:37,981
Fifteen.

512
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:40,275
-She has four Pieces, but he only has one.
-Right.

513
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:45,030
Tinno, I have… Kyuhyun, I have a question.

514
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:46,281
Yes?

515
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,700
I'm curious about something.
I have something to ask.

516
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,369
Are you ending it this round?

517
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,412
-No, we can't.
-You can't? Are you certain?

518
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:54,831
-Just let me know that.
-We haven't found it.

519
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:57,918
The thing is,
Justin is struggling for points.

520
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:00,045
Okay, so he can get them
this round and next.

521
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:03,048
So, he still has time to get them?
The game's not going to end?

522
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:04,966
-We can't end it. Don't worry.
-Okay, that's fine.

523
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,927
Kyuhyun is here.

524
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,513
So, just don't worry.
You just do what you have to do.

525
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:10,472
Don't be afraid.

526
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,265
"Don't be afraid…"

527
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:14,101
You are not alone.

528
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:19,314
The arrow auction of Round 7
will now begin.

529
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:22,234
If you've already gotten to it,
can you just tell us one thing?

530
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:23,902
So they can get some points.

531
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:25,946
-How did you get this?
-The blue one. You already have it.

532
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,447
Justin, what arrows do you have?

533
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,241
You have two of these?

534
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:32,953
But you can't get there with these.

535
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,956
Can you get more arrows in the auction?

536
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:36,957
No.

537
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,584
So, if we lend him one,
can he still not make it?

538
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:42,295
Not with these.
It can't be done with just one arrow.

539
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:45,549
Kang Ji-yeong,
please enter the auction booth.

540
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:46,925
I will bid one.

541
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:51,513
They're really curious
about how we solved the blue one.

542
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,014
Really? So they don't know?

543
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,558
-They still don't know.
-That's good.

544
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:56,059
He said it's really difficult.

545
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:57,477
Do you need a lot of something?

546
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,271
So-hui probably solved it.

547
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:01,773
I hope they don't figure it out
this turn. Please.

548
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:05,777
What do you study at KAIST?
Do you have to be good at math?

549
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:09,072
No, to do this, I don't think
you need to be good at math too.

550
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:10,866
Hear that? He said "math too."

551
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,701
Damn it. I can only do arithmetic.

552
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:13,952
No, spatial awareness…

553
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:15,620
Choi Hyun-joon, you're up next.

554
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:17,205
-How many chips did everyone put in?
-One.

555
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,331
-Four.
-I haven't yet.

556
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:22,002
My last.

557
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:22,961
I'll put it in.

558
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:26,673
Here are the results of the arrow auction.

559
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:29,676
Who did we say was going to go
for the purple one?

560
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,261
-Me.
-You're going for it, right?

561
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:33,722
Then go first. Because according to that--

562
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,516
I can just go and stand in line right now,

563
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,810
since I don't have to collect any arrows.

564
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:39,728
Go quickly.

565
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:45,442
Yoon So-hui, please choose your arrow.

566
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:46,860
I will take this one.

567
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:48,028
-This one?
-Yes.

568
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:50,614
What do you need to get to pink?

569
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:51,865
After going to green.

570
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:54,367
The last one. Set number 2.

571
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:57,037
Okay, let me affix a nametag.

572
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:07,631
Kyuhyun, please choose your arrow.

573
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:08,590
I'll take this one.

574
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,425
Getting this one?

575
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:11,885
-Yes, I really need it.
-Do you?

576
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:13,053
Yes.

577
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:14,888
It won't work without this.

578
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,890
Do you need it?

579
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:23,063
I'll take this special set.

580
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:24,606
-You may now take it.
-Thank you.

581
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:28,193
Kang Ji-yeong, please choose your arrow.

582
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,320
If you get this, how many will you have?

583
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:33,365
-Don't tell them. It hasn't changed.
-I don't have to know.

584
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:35,075
Please proceed with exploring.

585
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,376
Just a moment.

586
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,884
It doesn't work.

587
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:58,223
Did you get it?

588
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,935
-It didn't work?
-It didn't.

589
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:04,563
-It didn't?
-You can't go to purple with that anyway.

590
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:06,314
It doesn't work.

591
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,527
Why is it so difficult?

592
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,909
Oh, no, Justin. There's no way
we can get two. What do we do now?

593
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:20,245
No, it's fine. It's really fine.

594
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,711
I'm so grateful to my team.

595
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:38,638
I will submit it like this.

596
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,223
-Would you like to stop exploring?
-Yes.

597
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:43,059
I will now show you the red box.

598
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:47,063
Please check inside the box.

599
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:51,860
YOU MUST USE THIS BASIC ARROW
TO REACH THE TREASURE CHEST

600
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:52,902
Okay.

601
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:55,655
You have two minutes left.

602
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:06,625
I will submit this.

603
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:09,377
-You have 1 minute and 30 seconds left.
-Okay.

604
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,421
I will submit this.

605
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:12,464
I will submit this.

606
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:14,132
I will now show you the white box.

607
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:15,717
Yes, I've finished looking.

608
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,093
You have one minute left.

609
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,893
-You're going for a lot.
-What?

610
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,561
I'm going to try every piece.

611
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:27,854
I always bring everything.

612
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:31,691
Honestly. How could I use all of these?
That doesn't make sense.

613
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:34,319
I take all of mine
so as not to give any hints.

614
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:35,320
Oh, you do?

615
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:38,573
-That makes sense. It really does.
-That's wise.

616
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:39,491
Words of wisdom.

617
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:41,368
What's 7high doing outside?

618
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:44,037
Can't he help Justin get to yellow?

619
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,705
He hasn't got yellow yet.

620
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,499
-I think he's standing in line.
-Is he?

621
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:48,583
Yes, but…

622
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:50,960
7high.

623
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,254
It didn't work.

624
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:55,965
-You know the diagonal one.
-Yeah.

625
00:27:56,049 --> 00:28:00,011
You can't put that one in
like that, the way we thought.

626
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:04,057
Okay.

627
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,934
-Would you like to stop exploring?
-Yes.

628
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:08,144
-I will now show you the purple box.
-Okay.

629
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:10,271
Please check inside the box.

630
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:12,941
THE SPACE CONTAINING THE TREASURE CHEST
IS ADJACENT TO TWO FENCES

631
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:15,110
"The space is adjacent to two fences."

632
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:16,736
-Okay.
-Are you done?

633
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,824
I will now show you the orange box.

634
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:23,118
Would you like to stop exploring?

635
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:26,413
The red one said we need to use this
to reach the treasure chest.

636
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,622
That's two of those then.

637
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:30,333
There was no mention of two.
It just said we must use it.

638
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:33,753
But one of the hints said
that we must use two of the same kind.

639
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:36,005
Oh, right. I measured the height.

640
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,424
It was about this tall.

641
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:41,177
Hang on, my basic, okay.
I'll see you in a bit.

642
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:44,848
Don't tell them about blue.
They probably don't have it yet.

643
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:48,101
-So, this is five.
-Okay.

644
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,437
Did you get purple?

645
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:52,647
-Bravo!
-Yay!

646
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:53,982
Nice!

647
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,567
Did you get it? Congrats.

648
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:56,943
There's a wall at 3.5 squares.

649
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,946
-One, two, three, and a half, right?
-I got it.

650
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:05,118
The space with the treasure chest
is adjacent to two fences.

651
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:06,536
-So it's here.
-Yes.

652
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,956
It's over. It's here.
This is 3.5 squares. Hang on a sec.

653
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:12,375
Justin, did you get the green one?

654
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:15,211
He didn't get the yellow one.
Go for the green one, Justin.

655
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:16,921
You can use this one.

656
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:18,548
You can use this one from the green.

657
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:20,091
But to get to the green,

658
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,302
you need one of those two
that Ji-yeong has.

659
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:25,180
But Justin can just go straight
to the green with these.

660
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:27,223
-After that, you can just borrow this one.
-Really?

661
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:29,434
-Then take that one and go.
-Take that and get yellow.

662
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:33,855
Would you like to stop exploring?

663
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:34,939
Yes.

664
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,570
-Would you like to stop exploring?
-Yup.

665
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:43,156
-Tinno, can you hold this?
-Sure.

666
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:46,034
A wall at 3.5, a wall at 4.5. Wait.

667
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:48,453
-You want me to play the role of a wall?
-4.5 is here.

668
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:50,455
-Hold the one he's giving you.
-Okay, I'll hold it.

669
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:52,081
At 4.5. Hold this here in the middle.

670
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:54,501
Is this for real?

671
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:56,419
We really have to
use two of these to get it.

672
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:57,754
But you have to go in the water.

673
00:29:57,837 --> 00:30:01,090
Then let's bring it up.
Let's hold them in midair.

674
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:02,550
-Kyuhyun, you too.
-Like this?

675
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,969
All of these obstacles…

676
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,012
Take them out?

677
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:09,599
I don't think I've got this one yet,
so I'll explore it.

678
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:11,267
-Would you like to stop exploring?
-Yes.

679
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:14,979
As I expected, there's no need for this…

680
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:17,398
Is this definitely 0.5?
Then come forward a bit.

681
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,068
Hold it still.

682
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,571
A little forward. A little more.

683
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:26,991
It doesn't work at all.

684
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:29,828
It's no good. If this worked,
I would've gotten it earlier.

685
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:31,412
Go in and do some research.

686
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,206
I'll give it a try. Hang on.

687
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:34,666
But I think this is right.

688
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,418
-This.
-Hold on.

689
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:40,255
-Would you like to stop exploring?
-Yes.

690
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:44,342
-Would you like to stop exploring?
-Yes.

691
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:45,927
I will now show you the blue box.

692
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,472
-Please open the box.
-Okay.

693
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,183
Please open the box.

694
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:55,061
Oh, that's right. Please open the box.

695
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:57,772
-Would you like to stop exploring?
-Yes. Thank you.

696
00:30:58,731 --> 00:30:59,774
Let me just try this.

697
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:06,906
This fits. It works.

698
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:15,164
Okay.

699
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:17,750
Thank you.

700
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:27,093
Anyone know the ratio for this?

701
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:29,596
-Ratio?
-Hey, right now we're…

702
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:30,805
Just try eyeballing it.

703
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,265
Try what?

704
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:34,392
This?

705
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:35,852
-I'll do it.
-I can do that.

706
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:37,437
-Hey, it works.
-What?

707
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,354
-It works.
-Right?

708
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:39,397
-Right?
-Okay.

709
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,066
Now we get the treasure chest.

710
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,736
Let's check the points
and take all of the Pieces.

711
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:46,821
Let's do that. And, So-hui, you take it.

712
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,865
-No, it's okay.
-Yeah, take it, So-hui.

713
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:51,367
-You do it, So-hui.
-You found the most.

714
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:53,119
The only one I found was blue.

715
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:55,121
How many points does everyone have?

716
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:56,998
-I'll check.
-We need to see. We're not sure.

717
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,880
Hyun-gyu, she says it works.

718
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:05,089
She says it works.

719
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:08,551
Hey, are you sure you need
something like that in this game?

720
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:10,553
-It works.
-He just wants to confirm it.

721
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:13,056
-Just trust So-hui.
-I need to figure it out.

722
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:17,226
I think he just wants to do the math
to make sure that the principle is right.

723
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,479
-Sure, he should.
-That's why I'm letting him be.

724
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:20,939
Tangent.

725
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:22,857
Half.

726
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:34,285
-Hey.
-That's it. You found it.

727
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,789
Take this and join this on and then this.

728
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:38,831
But…

729
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:40,667
This is right.

730
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:41,876
Right?

731
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,420
-Justin, come.
-Come here a sec.

732
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:47,757
-What do you have? Show us.
-Justin needs this one.

733
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:51,386
Oh, Justin doesn't have that one.

734
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:56,224
We found it.
We found the way to go to red.

735
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:57,725
-Did you take geometry?
-Yeah.

736
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:00,436
-You're probably the same as me.
-Yeah, I know.

737
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,647
Hyun-gyu. Let's get in line now,
just in case.

738
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:04,399
You remember yesterday?
Don't let your guard down.

739
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:05,858
Right, you never know.

740
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:11,614
-Would you like to stop exploring?
-Yes.

741
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,617
-Okay.
-Would you like to stop exploring?

742
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:23,960
The exploration for Round 8
has now concluded.

743
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:26,796
Here are the points of each player.

744
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:30,299
Kyuhyun has gone up to 35 points.
Hey, they've found something.

745
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:34,554
-They've all increased their points.
-They must've all taken one or two.

746
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:36,931
-I think they've got one each.
-Right, one each.

747
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:39,600
The exploration of Round 9 will now begin

748
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:41,352
and last for the next 40 minutes.

749
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,187
-Should I go first?
-Yeah, go ahead.

750
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:46,566
Players may enter the dealer room
and arrange their arrows.

751
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:51,446
Please proceed with exploring.

752
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:52,739
I'm done.

753
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:53,740
That is correct.

754
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,243
Please proceed with exploring.

755
00:33:57,326 --> 00:34:01,205
Yes, I will explore it like this.

756
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:02,915
-Would you like to stop exploring?
-Yes.

757
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,758
I don't want to
stand around doing nothing.

758
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:14,927
I thought there must be
one more thing Justin could get.

759
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:17,180
I'll just give it 10 more minutes.

760
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:21,809
I'm feeling a little riled up right now.

761
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,978
Either this one or the orange one.

762
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,189
I'm so riled up,
I'm going to try and find it.

763
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:28,483
I want to go there and do something.

764
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:31,861
I'm too riled up to end it like this.

765
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:36,741
-But, because of this fence right here.
-But we can't go here right now.

766
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:38,409
We need to come here.

767
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:42,288
But the problem is how to get there.
We haven't found that out yet.

768
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:44,582
Have we found the orange one?
We can also do that.

769
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:46,084
We can try the orange one.

770
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,210
Orange?

771
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:51,047
I will submit this.

772
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,632
-Would you like to stop exploring?
-Yes.

773
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:55,218
I will submit this.

774
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:57,011
-Would you like to stop exploring?
-Yes.

775
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,388
Tinno, please proceed with exploring.

776
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:01,599
Here you are. Yes.

777
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:03,518
-Would you like to stop exploring?
-Yes.

778
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,731
I'm feeling a bit down…

779
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:15,696
Should I give Ji-yeong an arrow?

780
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,864
-You can't now.
-You can't.

781
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,449
She can get another box, perhaps.

782
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:21,744
If she gets one more,
she won't lose any Pieces.

783
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:23,454
-Oh, really?
-That's enough.

784
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,581
-Then let's ask.
-Let's go and talk to her.

785
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:27,667
Who hasn't gone in yet?

786
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,252
-Just me.
-Everyone else went.

787
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,424
But that's not it.
Ji-yeong doesn't have it.

788
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:36,342
Ji-yeong.

789
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:39,554
You go and do it.
Ji-yeong is going to get pink, so you go.

790
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:43,224
-What?
-Have you figured out another one?

791
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:44,934
Me? No, I didn't.

792
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:46,435
-What is it?
-You can't get another one?

793
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:47,937
We'll tell you how to get one.

794
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,147
-What?
-We'll tell you one.

795
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,064
Tell me what?

796
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:52,608
I'm going to go and do this one.

797
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,112
They must be ready to end it.
Hurry and get one.

798
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:57,905
Get it quickly.
Just go and get anything. Now.

799
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,365
-Okay.
-Just get it.

800
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:01,492
-I have one I can get. I'm good.
-You do?

801
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:03,703
Then you need to do it quickly. Do it now.

802
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:05,705
Who is going to go?

803
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,456
Me.

804
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:09,625
See? Come here.

805
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:12,378
Don't worry. We can't do it.

806
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:14,172
There's no need to be like that.

807
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:16,174
-I'm waiting. Yes.
-Are you still waiting?

808
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:18,009
You're not ending it, are you?

809
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:20,761
I know exactly why you came.

810
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,763
But there's no need to be like that.

811
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:25,308
7high is mad.

812
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:26,559
7high is mad? Why?

813
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:28,227
He asked why we're taking it so far.

814
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,354
What does that mean?

815
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:31,689
He says he knows why we came.

816
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:33,482
Can you end it after I get one?

817
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:35,401
-How many points do you have?
-I'm on 27.

818
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:37,862
-Should I hold off?
-Give me a moment to get one.

819
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:39,238
-What…
-I don't know.

820
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:41,157
-We'll just get five points each.
-I'm at 20 points.

821
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,912
I know what you're doing.

822
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:49,290
Just let her get one Piece
and let her have her turn.

823
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:52,752
Since they can't go in as they want,
just let them do that before you end it.

824
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:54,545
-Go for it.
-That's okay, right?

825
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:57,423
That's why they're here,
so there's no need to be like that.

826
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:58,674
-Take it.
-It's so obvious.

827
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,259
I know he wasn't really angry.

828
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:03,554
He was just worked up.
Probably because he was so focused.

829
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:07,266
But I just tend to get tongue-tied
when that happens.

830
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:10,102
It seems 7high got really emotional.

831
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:13,105
Personally, I feel bad for them

832
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:15,107
for having suffered every day in prison,

833
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:17,735
but that's just a part of
the game and the show.

834
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:20,112
Okay. Ji-yeong, you go in first. Go ahead.

835
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:22,281
What are the two? Can you tell us?

836
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:23,783
Please proceed with exploring.

837
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:31,249
Would you like to finish?

838
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:32,375
Yes, thank you.

839
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:33,793
Please exit the dealer room.

840
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:49,058
Yes, I would like to stop.

841
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:50,810
-Would you like to stop exploring?
-Yes.

842
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,066
Did you get one?

843
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:58,401
-Yes.
-Good job.

844
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:03,656
I felt helpless.

845
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:08,119
Well, because I couldn't do anything.
I really tried hard today.

846
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,121
It was a total defeat.

847
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:12,540
So, I don't feel regret or anything,

848
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:16,252
I just realized,
"Oh, I totally suck at this part."

849
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:17,837
Just my own incompetence?

850
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,839
Partly because I wanted to save Justin,

851
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:23,009
but I think I was just so angry at myself.

852
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:35,313
Using these two…

853
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:47,700
Here.

854
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:49,910
Here.

855
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:51,996
-Would you like to stop exploring?
-Yes.

856
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:53,706
Yoon So-hui.

857
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:59,378
You have found the treasure chest.

858
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:00,504
Yes.

859
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,737
Please wait in the dealer room
for a moment.

860
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:36,540
Damn it.

861
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:38,626
You know, it should feel like…

862
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:41,629
Well, I didn't know
what prison would be like before I came.

863
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,464
Who knew they would give us
prison uniforms?

864
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,758
-He didn't prepare them.
-You must have been glad.

865
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:47,385
But he didn't even wear it.

866
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:48,886
He just wore a white t-shirt.

867
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:51,138
I guess he didn't like the color.

868
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,475
Well done.

869
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:56,852
Well played.

870
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:58,354
Did you already do it?

871
00:39:58,437 --> 00:39:59,897
-Yeah, I did.
-Oh, nice.

872
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:01,607
So you have 25?

873
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:03,025
-Yeah.
-Oh, great.

874
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:08,155
I feel bad.

875
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,574
Oh my God, why? Don't…

876
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:14,161
Oh my God.

877
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:16,997
-Why are you crying?
-No.

878
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,583
I feel so dumb.

879
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:21,627
Why?

880
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:24,338
Why?

881
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:26,132
It was a really hard game.

882
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:27,758
Yeah, it was.

883
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,718
I think I'm frustrated with myself.

884
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:31,720
-Yeah.
-Yeah, I feel like…

885
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:38,519
But really…

886
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,147
You were so good, honestly.

887
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,565
Why are you crying?

888
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:43,899
You're making me…

889
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:46,360
-No.
-No, honestly.

890
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:47,903
You were so amazing yesterday.

891
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:49,697
So ultimately,

892
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,740
Justin actually must've felt,

893
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:54,118
towards the end,

894
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:56,203
really helpless.

895
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,164
He must've been so lonely.

896
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:02,001
I am so glad
we got to play together, honestly.

897
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,170
Stop crying.

898
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:07,256
No, I stopped crying. I stopped. Okay.

899
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:22,605
Okay.

900
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:40,456
-Did you…
-Did you get it?

901
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:41,832
She did, she's empty-handed.

902
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:45,169
Yoon So-hui has opened the treasure chest.

903
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,672
That concludes Treasure Island.

904
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,343
Here are the final points of each player.

905
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:56,305
The players who accumulated
more than 31 points,

906
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:57,640
Son Eun-yu,

907
00:41:57,723 --> 00:41:58,766
Choi Hyun-joon,

908
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:01,936
and Yoon So-hui,
you are awarded one Piece each.

909
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:04,355
Those who got more than 41 points,
Kyuhyun,

910
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:05,564
Jeong Hyun-gyu,

911
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:08,526
and Tinno,
you are awarded two Pieces each.

912
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:13,739
A penalty will be imposed
on players with 20 points or less.

913
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:20,204
Justin Min, please give up one Piece.

914
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:22,873
-Oh, my God.
-You did well.

915
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:26,752
Justin Min has lost all his Pieces.

916
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:31,298
Accordingly,

917
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:36,053
Justin Min becomes the sixth player
eliminated from The Devil's Plan.

918
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:40,891
Justin Min,
please leave this place immediately.

919
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:50,359
It was a dream for me, but…

920
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:52,236
"Oh, it was never going to happen,"

921
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,529
is what I thought.

922
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:04,373
It's the first time that

923
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:08,294
I've really got to working
with Korean people on a Korean show.

924
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:10,879
I'm also a Korean,

925
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:14,341
but I was born in the US
and grew up there.

926
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:23,225
But after being on this show,

927
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:24,643
I realize like…

928
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:28,439
we have so many similarities.

929
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:31,609
And ultimately, we're all Korean.

930
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,291
See you.

931
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:16,320
THE DEVIL'S PLAN
DEATH ROOM

932
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:19,281
As the person who opened
the treasure chest, Yoon So-hui

933
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:21,116
shall be rewarded extra Pieces.

934
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:31,210
TAKE 4 PIECES FROM OTHER PLAYERS

935
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:40,844
Damn it.

936
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:47,851
Yoon So-hui may take
four Pieces from other players.

937
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:49,311
That's her reward?

938
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:54,942
Yoon So-hui, please state how many Pieces

939
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:57,778
you would like to take from which players.

940
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:00,489
I need to think it over.

941
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:03,117
To be honest,

942
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:07,121
I'm normally more comfortable
with getting hit than doing the hitting,

943
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:08,539
so it's not easy.

944
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:11,709
Can we talk?
I'll talk to you one at a time.

945
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:15,421
I'll have them ready in my hands.

946
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:18,215
But we can't afford to let two go.

947
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:20,426
No, I need to take Pieces in a way

948
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:22,678
that no one else gets eliminated.

949
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:25,806
I was thinking about it just now

950
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:27,766
and I'll take them from Hyun-joon.

951
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:31,228
I can't take any more
from the prison gang.

952
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:33,439
Why not?

953
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:36,024
It's kind of harsh, they already…

954
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:36,984
It's a game.

955
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:40,028
So, the thing is…

956
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:43,240
For them, there's not much difference
between having one or two.

957
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:44,742
I suppose that might be better.

958
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:48,328
-Taking from the prison gang is right.
-Considering the next game, right?

959
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:50,581
Okay. Then I can just tell the others.

960
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:51,832
Can you tell me too?

961
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:53,333
I will. I'm going to tell everyone.

962
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:55,461
Considering the next game,

963
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:57,504
I think that is probably better.

964
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,465
Leaving a clear gap between us.

965
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:01,633
Then I will…

966
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:07,848
take one Piece from Ji-yeong,
two Pieces from 7high,

967
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:09,933
and one Piece from Eun-yu.

968
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:11,852
They all played together,

969
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:15,606
so I assumed she would take them
from us rather than them.

970
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:16,899
I feel so bad.

971
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:20,152
You did good. This is not something
you need to feel bad about.

972
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:21,361
So-hui, don't feel bad.

973
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:23,071
It's not something to be sorry about.

974
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:25,282
-I really feel so bad.
-No, it's just part of the game.

975
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:29,161
Hey, jeez.

976
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:30,954
So-hui, don't be like that.

977
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:33,123
-You could've sent me home.
-Is it one?

978
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:35,209
Okay.

979
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:37,586
Yoon So-hui, here are your four Pieces.

980
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:40,881
Here are the prize mission results.

981
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:44,676
With the elimination of one player,
the prize mission was a success.

982
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,721
100 million won will be added
to the accumulated prize money,

983
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:49,932
which now stands at 280 million won.

984
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:51,600
We've stacked up a lot.

985
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:53,602
Please give us a big treat.

986
00:46:53,685 --> 00:46:56,605
Here is the current Piece count
of each player now.

987
00:46:56,688 --> 00:47:01,151
Kyuhyun, Jeong Hyun-gyu, and Tinno
have the same number of Pieces.

988
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:03,570
The player with the most Pieces,
Choi Hyun-joon,

989
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:06,907
please choose a player
to go to the prison block.

990
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:10,160
Hyun-joon, you can decide. We'll step out.

991
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:13,038
I'm already next to them.
I'm already one of the gang.

992
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:14,915
So-hui, can we discuss it?

993
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:16,542
-Sure.
-It's just that…

994
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:18,043
I don't really feel good.

995
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:19,419
People keep being eliminated.

996
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:22,673
To be honest, I thought
it would be fun to keep advancing.

997
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:25,133
-Me too, it sucks so much.
-But I feel like crap.

998
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:26,426
Let's just accept it.

999
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:30,264
How about this?
We write down the names and draw lots.

1000
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:32,891
In front of them.

1001
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:36,937
The reason I became close
and have been playing

1002
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,564
with Kyuhyun, Hyun-gyu, and Tinno

1003
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:40,315
is that the four of us started out

1004
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:42,568
as corrupt cops and thieves
in the first game.

1005
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:45,946
Hyun-gyu had no idea what was going on

1006
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:48,115
but tried really hard
and pulled it off well.

1007
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:51,243
And even though
I put Kyuhyun in a difficult situation,

1008
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:52,703
he played really well too.

1009
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:57,583
And Tinno had an alliance
that he made at the beginning.

1010
00:47:57,666 --> 00:48:00,127
I thought he might sell me out
so that I would get caught,

1011
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:03,338
but he firmly said, "No, let's
just trust each other and go for it."

1012
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:05,299
So I thought,
"Okay, then I'll trust him too."

1013
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:10,220
And I think we got closer as we spent
time together in the living area.

1014
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:16,310
This is a really tortuous decision.

1015
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:19,104
I think…

1016
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:22,024
I'm too closely linked to all of them,

1017
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:25,485
I do think I'd choose one of the three.

1018
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:27,321
Who would you choose?

1019
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:31,325
I don't think Kyuhyun would make it
through the death match.

1020
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:34,161
Then who do you think
is most likely to survive in prison?

1021
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:38,040
I think Tinno is most likely to survive,
based on how I've seen him play.

1022
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:41,001
To be honest, if I send Tinno,

1023
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:43,337
since 7high is there too,

1024
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:46,548
I think he will be able to
survive in prison and come back.

1025
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:47,549
Hyun-gyu.

1026
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:50,135
I don't want to go to prison.

1027
00:48:50,218 --> 00:48:52,471
I know. I know your stance.

1028
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:53,597
You want to send him?

1029
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,223
-No, it's not that.
-Who do you want to send?

1030
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:57,559
-Someone who'd make it back, of course.
-Right.

1031
00:48:57,643 --> 00:48:59,061
Just think about it, by yourself.

1032
00:48:59,144 --> 00:49:00,687
-It's up to you.
-Yes.

1033
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:04,816
But you know what?
I want to play with you more.

1034
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,234
It's totally up to you.

1035
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:07,152
Then…

1036
00:49:07,235 --> 00:49:08,862
Whatever you decide to do, I'll…

1037
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:13,158
Well, later if a similar situation arises,
will you save me?

1038
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:15,994
-Of course I will.
-No, be very precise.

1039
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:18,163
Will you act according
to this relationship or not?

1040
00:49:20,832 --> 00:49:24,544
-But will I ever end up in this situation?
-You can imagine it.

1041
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:26,129
If it happens, I'll save you.

1042
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:27,923
Whether it's robbery or elimination?

1043
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:30,300
Okay, I can promise you that.

1044
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:37,349
Since I already ended up
feeling so bad and sad anyway,

1045
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:39,184
I should try and win.

1046
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:41,019
So I made a deal and kept Hyun-gyu.

1047
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:42,896
-Let's go.
-Let's get it!

1048
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:45,816
I…

1049
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:51,530
I've decided on Tinno.

1050
00:49:51,613 --> 00:49:52,489
Let's get it.

1051
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:56,284
Goodness, it seems we've got new prey.

1052
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:57,869
Time to fight for your life.

1053
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:59,204
I'm sorry.

1054
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,289
Don't be. It's part of the game.

1055
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:03,375
I felt a bit like that from the start.

1056
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:06,837
"My team will win,
but I'll end up in prison,"

1057
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,547
was always in the back of my mind.

1058
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:12,551
I was already mentally prepared,
so I felt at ease to some degree.

1059
00:50:12,634 --> 00:50:13,510
Kang Ji-yeong,

1060
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:14,761
7high,

1061
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:15,846
Son Eun-yu,

1062
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:16,847
and Tinno…

1063
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:19,683
-You did so well.
-…you will be sent to the prison block.

1064
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:21,059
Well done.

1065
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:24,521
All players, please make your way
to your assigned accommodations.

1066
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:26,982
Welcome to prison. Let's go.

1067
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:28,650
-Don't get rid of Tinno.
-What?

1068
00:50:28,734 --> 00:50:29,776
Don't get rid of Tinno.

1069
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,319
The thing is, it's not like

1070
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:34,156
I can get rid of him even if I want to.
You know that.

1071
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:40,328
So this is how it feels.
The view from here.

1072
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:41,496
Bye-bye.

1073
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:43,540
See you tomorrow.

1074
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:45,375
-See you tomorrow.
-See you tomorrow, Tinno.

1075
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:47,085
-Make sure you come back safe.
-Bye.

1076
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:52,424
You go first. Go on.
Since it's your first time.

1077
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:56,219
-Is this how it feels?
-Tinno should head up first.

1078
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:04,102
It's pretty decent.

1079
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:05,937
-What the heck?
-It looks okay, right?

1080
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:07,064
It's luxurious.

1081
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:10,984
But it feels a bit sparse.

1082
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:13,904
So, where's my bunk?

1083
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:15,155
Well, mine is here.

1084
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:17,365
I'm next to 7high. We're roomies.

1085
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:19,493
No, Tinno, not anymore.

1086
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:22,204
-How many people have you killed so far?
-Me?

1087
00:51:22,287 --> 00:51:25,916
Why do you keep using your brain
to benefit others? It's driving me crazy.

1088
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:28,251
I'd understand if it were
for yourself or Kyuhyun,

1089
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:29,836
but didn't you see that crap?

1090
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,923
"I don't want to go to prison."
How could you just watch that?

1091
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:34,883
He suddenly looked at him and said,

1092
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:36,551
"I don't want to go to prison."

1093
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:38,595
I overheard it.

1094
00:51:38,678 --> 00:51:40,097
And I was like,

1095
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,348
"Look at this guy."

1096
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:43,934
Hyun-gyu kept saying
he really wanted to go to prison.

1097
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:45,310
Then he said he wanted to live.

1098
00:51:45,393 --> 00:51:47,062
But how did you end up here?

1099
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:48,063
Why you?

1100
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:51,108
-I heard them talking.
-I did too. Did you do something wrong?

1101
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:53,652
It's not that. There's only one reason.

1102
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:56,696
They think that Tinno is
the guy who most likely has the ability

1103
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,156
to make it back alive.

1104
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:00,200
Is that what Hyun-joon was talking about?

1105
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:01,326
-That too.
-That's it!

1106
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:04,704
For me, the biggest thing is
that I'm really sorry about

1107
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:06,373
what happened to this team yesterday.

1108
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:09,167
It's going to be three, three, three.
So one of those two will die.

1109
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:11,044
Tinno, are we playing as a nine?
No, right?

1110
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:12,671
Weren't the nine of us playing as one?

1111
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:14,256
We were originally
thinking of all nine of us.

1112
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:16,883
So we have the choice.
Six with you, or six with them.

1113
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:18,760
But I think we have no choice
but to go with them.

1114
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:22,222
I mean, seriously, you did betray us
yesterday. You have to admit that.

1115
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:24,766
But I don't want your apology.
So just keep feeling bad.

1116
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:26,268
Really? I apologize.

1117
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:31,106
I don't think it's something
that needs to be apologized for.

1118
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:33,275
No, it's just that I do feel bad.

1119
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:35,777
So…

1120
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:39,239
I just wanted to hear
their side of the story.

1121
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:41,825
Whether it be spite or gripe.

1122
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:44,786
It's really empty in here,
now that there are only four of us.

1123
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:48,957
-God, Tinno. He's such a nice guy.
-Then it'll be three on day 6.

1124
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:51,668
So two with most Pieces
are going to the final.

1125
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:54,629
Damn it,
we're talking about Tinno right now.

1126
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:56,840
You heartless punk.

1127
00:52:56,923 --> 00:52:58,884
We can be nice to him when we get out.

1128
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:00,927
-It's not like he'll die and vanish.
-You stone-cold punk.

1129
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:05,348
-Honestly, today we really sucked.
-Wasn't it hard?

1130
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:07,184
-It was so difficult.
-Yeah, it really was.

1131
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:10,061
If you get the hang of it, it gets easier,

1132
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:11,771
but it was hard to figure it out.

1133
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:14,816
-We assumed wrongly about the walls.
-We did.

1134
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,985
Today, we were all "Dumb and Dumber."

1135
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:19,571
All three of us have
bad spatial perception.

1136
00:53:19,654 --> 00:53:21,531
But who was the main player on your team?

1137
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:23,909
I mean, who figured out most of them?

1138
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:26,161
-Our team is like…
-Yes?

1139
00:53:26,244 --> 00:53:28,663
-Everyone has their own role. But…
-But…

1140
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:32,083
the main brain, I think, is So-hui.
So-hui is really the most…

1141
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:34,794
She's like a supercomputer.
You input something, she spits an answer.

1142
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:38,590
-Like a supercomputer.
-But So-hui and Hyun-gyu overlap.

1143
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:43,470
Why do I feel so weak?

1144
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:45,555
Am I that exhausted?

1145
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:48,600
Yeah, I'm not surprised
after playing games for four days.

1146
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:51,144
How can we liven things up a bit?

1147
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:52,646
Kyuhyun, can you teach us how to dance?

1148
00:53:53,146 --> 00:53:54,731
-What can we do?
-What would you like to know?

1149
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:57,400
How about "Sorry, sorry"?

1150
00:53:57,484 --> 00:53:58,693
You mean…

1151
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:00,195
-You can't just step into it.
-Okay.

1152
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:03,365
Bend your knees and bend over slightly.

1153
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:07,744
And bounce as you fold like this.

1154
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:12,415
-Two, two, three, four.
-Three, four.

1155
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:15,293
-Two, two, three, four.
-Two, two, three, four.

1156
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:17,963
Two, two, three, four.

1157
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:24,261
Tinno, dinner. That's our dinner.

1158
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:26,846
Holy moly! What's this?

1159
00:54:27,555 --> 00:54:28,390
This is dinner?

1160
00:54:28,473 --> 00:54:30,392
Someone said, "That's dinner,"
and when I looked,

1161
00:54:30,475 --> 00:54:32,018
there were a few hunks of bread.

1162
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:34,813
So the food in the living area
immediately came to mind.

1163
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:37,357
It's like when you're
on leave from the military,

1164
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,944
you eat something, like chicken,
and there are some leftovers.

1165
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:42,570
You keep thinking about it back at base.

1166
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:45,865
I felt like, "I should've eaten
one more spoonful this morning."

1167
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:50,495
Still, Tinno is the only person
who would listen to our anger.

1168
00:54:50,578 --> 00:54:51,621
-That's true.
-Yes.

1169
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:53,248
Kyuhyun might've done a good job too.

1170
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:54,624
If Kyuhyun were here,

1171
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:57,168
I would have really had a go at him again.

1172
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:59,087
It's Hyun-gyu that should be here.

1173
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:01,631
I was planning to have
a showdown with you tomorrow.

1174
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:02,966
-With me?
-Yeah.

1175
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:04,634
But?

1176
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:06,219
But we had that handshake.

1177
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:07,804
Oh, you're holding up your promise?

1178
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:09,681
If I were you, I would have sent me.

1179
00:55:09,764 --> 00:55:11,683
If you saw me as a threat.

1180
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:14,060
-To prison?
-That's the right thing to do. Yes.

1181
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:16,479
But I'm still having fun playing together.

1182
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:19,024
But our objective is to win.

1183
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:21,526
He said, "If I were you,
I would have booted you."

1184
00:55:21,609 --> 00:55:24,821
So I was like,
"Oh? He knows how I really feel."

1185
00:55:24,904 --> 00:55:26,072
"I'd better do as he says."

1186
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:28,325
I know he's rational,
but he's way too rational,

1187
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:30,368
so any sense of guilt I had is now gone.

1188
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:33,121
After all, he said it himself,
so he'll probably stick to it.

1189
00:55:33,204 --> 00:55:34,956
I hope he won't be too upset.

1190
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:40,045
20 HOURS LATER

1191
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:41,671
Do you know how to do arithmetic?

1192
00:55:46,551 --> 00:55:48,470
Listen to me. Please.

1193
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:53,099
I think I was too greedy.

1194
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:56,269
Well,

1195
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:58,063
we have to kill all of them.

1196
00:55:59,981 --> 00:56:03,026
I don't even know
what day of the week it is.

1197
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:06,404
Well, it feels like
I've lost touch with reality.

1198
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:10,283
I've forgotten about my life
as Kang Ji-yeong the newscaster.

1199
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:12,786
-And I…
-I keep reminding her.

1200
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:15,914
In here, I feel like
I'm just a nobody with a few Pieces.

1201
00:56:15,997 --> 00:56:17,332
A beggar.

1202
00:56:17,415 --> 00:56:19,793
Yes, a beggar. A downtrodden beggar.

1203
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:23,296
If you have any questions,
just ask our landlady. She's our landlady.

1204
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:24,964
-But today, I--
-Oh, you're the owner?

1205
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:26,633
-I--
-The boss.

1206
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:28,051
I'm renting you a bed each.

1207
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:29,010
Yes, boss.

1208
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:30,762
I felt really weird today.

1209
00:56:30,845 --> 00:56:32,305
When Justin left earlier.

1210
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:36,476
Everyone who played with me
are being eliminated one by one.

1211
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:40,772
Right. You might feel like
you're gradually losing allies.

1212
00:56:40,855 --> 00:56:44,401
Not all allies, but the people
I've played with are going one by one.

1213
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:46,945
Those who were originally
in prison with me are now gone.

1214
00:56:47,028 --> 00:56:51,157
Except for Hyun-joon in the living area,
everyone else is gone.

1215
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:52,951
All your childhood friends have left home.

1216
00:56:53,034 --> 00:56:55,662
-Well, I mean, they're gone.
-Since this is where you were born.

1217
00:56:56,454 --> 00:56:58,790
There's not long left now.

1218
00:56:58,873 --> 00:57:00,417
I wonder what game it will be.

1219
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:05,964
Considering the opponents today,
I'm going to have to raise my game.

1220
00:57:08,007 --> 00:57:12,095
The prison match will begin in 30 minutes.

1221
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:15,056
Here are the rules
for the fourth prison match

1222
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:17,642
that will decide
the seventh person to be eliminated.

1223
00:57:17,725 --> 00:57:18,893
So this is how you see it.

1224
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:20,979
Today's prison match is

1225
00:57:21,062 --> 00:57:22,647
Triple Dice.

1226
00:57:23,189 --> 00:57:24,149
It's dice.

1227
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:27,485
Triple dice is a game
where you must achieve

1228
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:30,405
the highest score possible
with three dice.

1229
00:57:31,072 --> 00:57:33,783
Each player shall be
provided nine white dice,

1230
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:36,578
one red die, and one blue die,

1231
00:57:36,661 --> 00:57:39,038
for a total of 11 dice.

1232
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:41,207
When the game begins,

1233
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:45,753
each player rolls their nine white dice.

1234
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:48,590
The white dice are open dice,

1235
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:52,343
and all players can see
what has been rolled.

1236
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:54,512
After rolling the open dice,

1237
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:58,183
each player rolls their red and blue dice

1238
00:57:58,266 --> 00:58:01,769
in the dice tower
of their respective color.

1239
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:04,814
These dice are hidden dice,

1240
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:09,611
and they are only visible to the player.

1241
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:15,492
The first player will look
at the results of their 11 dice

1242
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:19,787
and select three to submit
as their first combination.

1243
00:58:20,413 --> 00:58:23,625
The next player should submit
their own combination

1244
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:27,795
after considering what has been submitted
by the previous player.

1245
00:58:28,379 --> 00:58:32,675
If a player wants to submit
a combination including a hidden die,

1246
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:37,013
they should submit the colored marker
representing their die.

1247
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:40,975
It is possible to submit
both hidden dice at the same time.

1248
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:43,394
The hidden dice will be revealed

1249
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:47,649
once all players
have made their submissions.

1250
00:58:47,732 --> 00:58:50,193
After the first round of submissions
is complete,

1251
00:58:50,276 --> 00:58:52,237
the combinations shall be compared,

1252
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:56,574
and points shall be awarded
according to their ranking.

1253
00:58:57,283 --> 00:59:02,455
Here are the dice combinations
that value from highest to lowest.

1254
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:04,249
Triple.

1255
00:59:04,332 --> 00:59:07,293
All three dice must be the same number.

1256
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:08,336
Straight.

1257
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:12,257
All three dice
must be consecutive numbers.

1258
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:15,593
Six and one are not considered
to be consecutive.

1259
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:16,803
Double.

1260
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:20,848
Two of the three dice submitted
should be of the same number.

1261
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:21,933
Single.

1262
00:59:22,016 --> 00:59:28,147
The dice submitted do not form
any of a triple, straight, or double.

1263
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:30,191
Isn't this just cards that go up to six?

1264
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:33,820
In the event that multiple players
submit the same combination,

1265
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:38,032
ranking shall be determined
by who has the higher number.

1266
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:42,870
If the highest number
in the combinations are also the same,

1267
00:59:42,954 --> 00:59:47,125
the higher remaining die
shall determine the higher player.

1268
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:50,753
If all dice submitted are the same,

1269
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:52,505
it shall be declared a tie.

1270
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:54,674
Points shall be awarded according to rank,

1271
00:59:54,757 --> 01:00:01,055
6 points for 1st place, 3 points for 2nd,
1 point for 3rd, and none for 4th.

1272
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:03,725
The point gap is big for first and second.

1273
01:00:03,808 --> 01:00:07,228
If multiple players
submit exactly the same dice,

1274
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:11,232
the points for the corresponding ranks
shall be added up and divided among them.

1275
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:12,275
For example,

1276
01:00:12,358 --> 01:00:16,738
if two players share 1st place
with the same triple combination,

1277
01:00:16,821 --> 01:00:20,533
the points for 1st and 2nd place,
6 and 3 points, shall be added up,

1278
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:23,494
and each player shall receive 4.5 points.

1279
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:24,829
They even give decimals.

1280
01:00:24,912 --> 01:00:27,206
From the second submission onward,

1281
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:32,337
the player who ranked highest
in the previous submission shall go first

1282
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:35,632
by selecting three
of their remaining eight dice

1283
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:37,925
to submit
as their second dice combination.

1284
01:00:38,509 --> 01:00:40,094
Oh, so we don't roll again.

1285
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:44,766
In the event that multiple players
tied for first in the previous submission,

1286
01:00:44,849 --> 01:00:49,020
the player with the most points
shall go first.

1287
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:52,357
After the third submission,

1288
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:55,276
the remaining two dice shall be discarded,

1289
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,236
and the round comes to an end.

1290
01:00:58,029 --> 01:01:02,950
Before submitting
the first combination for each round,

1291
01:01:03,034 --> 01:01:07,872
each player shall submit
a score prediction card to the dealer,

1292
01:01:07,955 --> 01:01:10,625
predicting their own score for that round.

1293
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:12,001
That's so complicated.

1294
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:15,922
The following are
the four different score prediction cards.

1295
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:18,591
Zero, for zero points.

1296
01:01:19,133 --> 01:01:22,804
Minimum, for one to six points.

1297
01:01:23,554 --> 01:01:27,475
More, for seven to ten points.

1298
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:30,937
Maximum, for more than ten points.

1299
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:34,023
Players who successfully
predict their score

1300
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:37,151
shall be awarded additional points
at the conclusion of that round.

1301
01:01:37,235 --> 01:01:38,361
How many?

1302
01:01:38,444 --> 01:01:40,738
Players who successfully
predict their score

1303
01:01:40,822 --> 01:01:44,200
shall be awarded double the score
they achieved in that round.

1304
01:01:45,743 --> 01:01:49,580
However, a player
that successfully predicts a score of zero

1305
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:51,708
shall be awarded 40 points.

1306
01:01:53,084 --> 01:01:54,293
That means Zero is the best.

1307
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:57,004
It won't be easy.
You could go for Zero and end up dying.

1308
01:01:57,088 --> 01:01:59,090
The game consists of four rounds,

1309
01:01:59,173 --> 01:02:01,884
and the game ends after Round 4.

1310
01:02:02,635 --> 01:02:06,764
The player with the highest score
shall receive one Piece.

1311
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:07,890
They're giving Pieces today?

1312
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:11,811
If multiple players finish
with the same highest score,

1313
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:13,980
no Piece shall be awarded.

1314
01:02:14,689 --> 01:02:17,942
The player with the lowest score

1315
01:02:18,025 --> 01:02:20,945
will be eliminated from The Devil's Plan.

1316
01:02:21,863 --> 01:02:25,742
The prison match will begin in 30 minutes.

1317
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:28,369
The game's pretty good today. Dice.

1318
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:30,872
But the last one is really…

1319
01:02:30,955 --> 01:02:31,789
Right?

1320
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:32,957
Thank you.

1321
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:34,083
This is how they give it.

1322
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:36,419
-The guard is pretty scary. Is this it?
-Right? Yes.

1323
01:02:36,502 --> 01:02:37,420
Thanks.

1324
01:02:37,962 --> 01:02:39,797
Gosh.

1325
01:02:39,881 --> 01:02:41,632
Let's study up.

1326
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:47,180
Before that came out, I was like,
"So, what's today's game?"

1327
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:48,389
Jeez, predictions.

1328
01:02:48,473 --> 01:02:50,475
After yesterday's sniping, now predicting.

1329
01:02:50,558 --> 01:02:53,060
Having four ranges makes it so difficult.

1330
01:02:53,144 --> 01:02:54,729
Still easier than the lottery.

1331
01:02:55,396 --> 01:02:58,065
We'll predict and then struggle
to match our predictions.

1332
01:02:58,149 --> 01:03:00,026
Exactly. That won't be easy either.

1333
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:01,736
Doubling your score is amazing.

1334
01:03:01,819 --> 01:03:03,446
PLAYERS WHO PREDICT CORRECTLY
WILL RECEIVE DOUBLE POINTS

1335
01:03:03,529 --> 01:03:05,865
If you get more by accident,
it might be your loss.

1336
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:08,117
Getting the same ranking
will be so annoying.

1337
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:10,870
-Because you have to share the points.
-After calculating everything.

1338
01:03:10,953 --> 01:03:13,331
-Still, it's better than getting nothing.
-Right.

1339
01:03:13,414 --> 01:03:14,415
Exactly.

1340
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:17,126
Do you fully understand Triple Dice?

1341
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:18,753
Yeah, you have to distribute well.

1342
01:03:18,836 --> 01:03:20,546
Tinno is going to ace this.

1343
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:24,008
Ace? I talked with him
until 3 a.m. last night.

1344
01:03:24,091 --> 01:03:26,302
You see, Se-dol invented a board game.

1345
01:03:26,385 --> 01:03:29,013
And Tinno went to the unveiling of it.

1346
01:03:29,096 --> 01:03:31,808
-Tinno is the most serious about this.
-He is.

1347
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:45,696
So this is what it's like.
An academic atmosphere for 30 minutes.

1348
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:49,325
It's normally not like this,
but it's different today.

1349
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:56,541
I'm sad. I might be smiling,
but it doesn't mean I'm smiling.

1350
01:04:01,254 --> 01:04:02,880
Just my incompetence?

1351
01:04:05,299 --> 01:04:06,884
Lack of ability signifies incompetence.

1352
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:17,019
Can someone else go first? I'm so sorry.

1353
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:18,020
Darn it.

1354
01:04:22,733 --> 01:04:25,152
I'll just fight with everything I've got.

1355
01:04:25,236 --> 01:04:29,156
Although I am worried
that I don't have much left in me…

1356
01:04:31,993 --> 01:04:33,369
I have to try my best.

1357
01:04:37,665 --> 01:04:38,666
I don't get it.

1358
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:40,543
I'll just have to do it.

1359
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:46,090
The prison match will begin shortly.

1360
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:48,676
All players in the prison block,

1361
01:04:48,759 --> 01:04:51,262
please make your way to the death room.

1362
01:04:51,345 --> 01:04:53,014
Let's go, go, go.

1363
01:04:55,182 --> 01:04:56,976
I can't believe I'm here.

1364
01:04:57,727 --> 01:04:59,061
So this is what it's like.

1365
01:05:06,652 --> 01:05:08,321
Here I am again.

1366
01:05:08,946 --> 01:05:11,616
-Damn, two days in a row.
-I'm back again.

1367
01:05:13,701 --> 01:05:14,535
Tinno.

1368
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:16,454
Tinno's over there.

1369
01:05:16,537 --> 01:05:18,539
But how do you roll it in here?

1370
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:21,584
-No, you put the dice here like this.
-Oh, just the dice?

1371
01:05:21,667 --> 01:05:25,338
-You put it like this? You don't shake it?
-You just put it when you want to use it.

1372
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:27,089
Tinno is going to win.

1373
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:30,384
Because there are lots of board games
where you have to bet on your own points.

1374
01:05:30,468 --> 01:05:32,178
Is this Tinno's style of game?

1375
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:34,430
-Now, let's try and have some fun.
-Good luck.

1376
01:05:34,513 --> 01:05:36,390
-Good luck!
-Let's get it!

1377
01:05:36,474 --> 01:05:40,645
The fourth prison match,
Triple Dice, will begin.

1378
01:05:42,229 --> 01:05:44,857
Round 1 will now begin.

1379
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:47,610
First, we'll decide
which player will go first.

1380
01:05:47,693 --> 01:05:50,488
Please roll two dice on the dice tray.

1381
01:05:51,155 --> 01:05:52,281
Let's go.

1382
01:05:55,868 --> 01:05:59,872
7high and Son Eun-yu
both have the same lowest score.

1383
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:01,499
Would both of you please roll again?

1384
01:06:01,582 --> 01:06:02,959
-That's low.
-I'm higher.

1385
01:06:04,752 --> 01:06:07,672
By virtue of having the lowest score,
Son Eun-yu will go first.

1386
01:06:07,755 --> 01:06:10,007
Here are the score prediction cards.

1387
01:06:10,091 --> 01:06:11,634
-Oh, these.
-So these are it.

1388
01:06:15,179 --> 01:06:17,223
Please roll your nine open dice.

1389
01:06:18,891 --> 01:06:19,892
Please be good.

1390
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:21,936
-Come on.
-Let's roll something good. Please.

1391
01:06:22,019 --> 01:06:23,145
Don't be the first to die!

1392
01:06:23,229 --> 01:06:24,772
Don't betray me!

1393
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:28,734
So what now?

1394
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:30,444
Do they roll that many at once?

1395
01:06:30,528 --> 01:06:31,821
They choose from them.

1396
01:06:31,904 --> 01:06:33,155
Three times for one round.

1397
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:36,742
Please put the hidden dice in
their respective dice tower and roll them.

1398
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:47,044
Why are all yours so high?

1399
01:06:47,795 --> 01:06:49,714
Tell me about it. That's just how I roll.

1400
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:51,716
Tinno's hand is strong.

1401
01:06:59,098 --> 01:07:01,350
Please submit your prediction cards.

1402
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:03,894
Son Eun-yu, the first player,
please submit your card.

1403
01:07:03,978 --> 01:07:05,396
Well, okay.

1404
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:08,607
Zero, min, max. And there's also More.

1405
01:07:11,402 --> 01:07:15,197
For Round 1, my dice weren't that bad,

1406
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:18,451
so I thought I should
go for it and bet on Max.

1407
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:20,369
Tinno, please submit your card.

1408
01:07:21,787 --> 01:07:23,330
What would be good?

1409
01:07:23,831 --> 01:07:26,584
I think Tinno might go for Max.
I would if I were him.

1410
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:31,005
I will go with this one.

1411
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:34,341
7high.

1412
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:40,139
Aren't 7high's dice not that good?

1413
01:07:40,222 --> 01:07:41,599
I'm not sure.

1414
01:07:41,682 --> 01:07:43,976
Because we don't know
what his hidden dice are.

1415
01:07:53,277 --> 01:07:55,613
Kang Ji-yeong, please submit your card.

1416
01:07:59,033 --> 01:08:02,661
By the way,
Ji-yeong looks really worn out today.

1417
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:05,081
-It seems she wants to go home, I think.
-Really?

1418
01:08:05,164 --> 01:08:07,083
She seems different from yesterday, right?

1419
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:09,710
When you're in prison,
you become listless. Really.

1420
01:08:09,794 --> 01:08:12,421
-And I think it becomes a vicious cycle.
-I see.

1421
01:08:24,558 --> 01:08:27,019
Please submit
your first combination of dice.

1422
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:29,647
Son Eun-yu, the first player,
please submit your dice.

1423
01:08:30,564 --> 01:08:31,524
Let's go.

1424
01:08:37,571 --> 01:08:38,948
She'll get the first lot.

1425
01:08:39,031 --> 01:08:40,866
She's going hard right from the start.

1426
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:43,869
She's going for six points.
There's nothing to beat her there.

1427
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:46,997
-That's hard to compete against.
-You could still go for second place.

1428
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:49,208
Get second place for three points?

1429
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:51,252
Next, Tinno, please submit your dice.

1430
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:06,016
You have submitted your blue hidden dice.

1431
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:06,934
Yes.

1432
01:09:07,017 --> 01:09:09,436
Triple 4s? It must be.

1433
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:12,731
7high, please submit
your combination of dice.

1434
01:09:34,336 --> 01:09:36,755
Kang Ji-yeong, please submit your dice.

1435
01:09:39,758 --> 01:09:42,595
-7high must've predicted low.
-Then Ji-yeong should discard some.

1436
01:09:49,393 --> 01:09:51,061
-What?
-What?

1437
01:09:51,145 --> 01:09:53,397
-Is the red one useless?
-I guess so.

1438
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:55,482
Still, she should keep it
to use as a threat.

1439
01:09:55,566 --> 01:09:56,400
Exactly.

1440
01:09:56,483 --> 01:09:58,611
All submissions have been made.

1441
01:09:58,694 --> 01:09:59,904
Tinno and Kang Ji-yeong,

1442
01:09:59,987 --> 01:10:01,697
please reveal your hidden dice.

1443
01:10:08,746 --> 01:10:10,080
-Is that a 3?
-Yes.

1444
01:10:10,164 --> 01:10:11,707
-I think she just tossed it.
-Exactly.

1445
01:10:13,167 --> 01:10:14,960
Here are the current points.

1446
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:16,962
Son Eun-yu, six points.

1447
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:18,672
7high, three points.

1448
01:10:18,756 --> 01:10:20,341
Tinno, one point.

1449
01:10:20,424 --> 01:10:22,218
Kang Ji-yeong, zero points.

1450
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:25,638
With the highest points
in the previous submission,

1451
01:10:25,721 --> 01:10:27,806
Son Eun-yu will again go first.

1452
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:29,350
Eun-yu is really amazing.

1453
01:10:29,433 --> 01:10:31,477
-What's with her?
-Yes, she really is amazing.

1454
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:33,312
She's like the queen of the prison.

1455
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:35,397
-She's a superwoman.
-For real.

1456
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:37,024
Please submit your dice.

1457
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:50,162
Then Tinno will submit his triple 5s,
won't he?

1458
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:52,414
Unless Eun-yu submits triple 5s…

1459
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:53,999
She can't. She only has two.

1460
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:55,334
If she has a hidden one.

1461
01:10:55,876 --> 01:10:58,587
Small chance, but we don't know
if she has a 5 or not.

1462
01:11:14,478 --> 01:11:15,437
Tinno.

1463
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:19,525
Five, five, five.

1464
01:11:23,070 --> 01:11:24,196
7high.

1465
01:11:42,172 --> 01:11:44,550
As long as 7high doesn't play triple 5s.

1466
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:46,969
-Even if he does, they'll both get 4.5.
-Right. Yes.

1467
01:11:57,938 --> 01:11:59,898
It's nothing. He's just discarding dice.

1468
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:01,817
-Hey, he's…
-Yeah, tossing it.

1469
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:04,778
I guess he put his prediction
on one of the ambiguous ones.

1470
01:12:04,862 --> 01:12:07,448
Kang Ji-yeong, please submit your dice.

1471
01:12:18,542 --> 01:12:20,586
-Ji-yeong?
-Straight.

1472
01:12:20,669 --> 01:12:22,421
Straight? Wait, in that case…

1473
01:12:22,504 --> 01:12:23,630
Tinno wins for sure.

1474
01:12:23,714 --> 01:12:26,884
All players have now submitted their dice.

1475
01:12:26,967 --> 01:12:28,761
7high, Kang Ji-yeong,

1476
01:12:28,844 --> 01:12:30,262
please reveal your hidden dice.

1477
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:31,180
Let's see.

1478
01:12:32,431 --> 01:12:34,433
Come on, man.

1479
01:12:38,854 --> 01:12:39,730
What?

1480
01:12:40,439 --> 01:12:42,232
-It's a 3.
-Okay.

1481
01:12:42,316 --> 01:12:43,400
3, 4, 6?

1482
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:46,737
Shit.

1483
01:12:50,074 --> 01:12:51,658
What's Ji-yeong going to do?

1484
01:12:51,742 --> 01:12:53,535
Hasn't she used both her hidden dice?

1485
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:55,120
-She has.
-Yes.

1486
01:12:55,704 --> 01:12:57,331
Shit!

1487
01:12:59,583 --> 01:13:01,335
Relax. It's okay, Ji-yeong.

1488
01:13:06,048 --> 01:13:07,716
Here are the current points.

1489
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:09,343
Tinno, six points.

1490
01:13:09,843 --> 01:13:11,428
Son Eun-yu, three points.

1491
01:13:11,929 --> 01:13:13,555
7high, one point.

1492
01:13:14,139 --> 01:13:16,350
Kang Ji-yeong, zero points.

1493
01:13:16,433 --> 01:13:18,769
Tinno will go first.

1494
01:13:18,852 --> 01:13:20,354
Gosh. To think it's my turn.

1495
01:13:21,772 --> 01:13:23,232
Then, this time…

1496
01:13:24,024 --> 01:13:25,192
Where'd it go?

1497
01:13:33,867 --> 01:13:34,785
7high.

1498
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:38,622
-I think it's triple 5s.
-No.

1499
01:13:43,877 --> 01:13:44,878
Kang Ji-yeong.

1500
01:13:54,346 --> 01:13:56,014
Then Ji-yeong can't win.

1501
01:14:13,198 --> 01:14:14,825
I made a stupid mistake.

1502
01:14:16,368 --> 01:14:18,829
-It is what it is.
-Son Eun-yu, please submit your dice.

1503
01:14:30,924 --> 01:14:32,050
What's that?

1504
01:14:32,801 --> 01:14:35,179
-Two hidden dice?
-Could it be 3, 4, 5?

1505
01:14:35,262 --> 01:14:36,346
Anyone's game.

1506
01:14:44,104 --> 01:14:47,232
All players have now submitted their dice.

1507
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:49,151
Son Eun-yu, 7high,

1508
01:14:49,234 --> 01:14:50,819
please reveal your hidden dice.

1509
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:55,449
-Just as I thought.
-7high.

1510
01:14:58,660 --> 01:14:59,995
Oh, my God.

1511
01:15:00,078 --> 01:15:01,079
It's two 4s.

1512
01:15:02,956 --> 01:15:04,541
Both of them went for it at the end.

1513
01:15:04,625 --> 01:15:06,835
To be honest,
until I went to the prison match,

1514
01:15:06,919 --> 01:15:09,838
I didn't really care
who would get eliminated,

1515
01:15:09,922 --> 01:15:10,881
even if it was me.

1516
01:15:10,964 --> 01:15:13,509
I really just wanted to win
first place today.

1517
01:15:13,592 --> 01:15:16,386
I was focused on going forward
without keeping anyone in check.

1518
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:18,263
Here are the current points.

1519
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:19,806
7high, six points.

1520
01:15:19,890 --> 01:15:21,600
Son Eun-yu, three points.

1521
01:15:21,683 --> 01:15:23,310
Tinno, one point.

1522
01:15:23,393 --> 01:15:25,729
Kang Ji-yeong, zero points.

1523
01:15:26,313 --> 01:15:28,982
Here are the player's predictions.

1524
01:15:29,066 --> 01:15:30,234
I'm so curious.

1525
01:15:30,317 --> 01:15:31,610
Doubling is important.

1526
01:15:31,693 --> 01:15:32,653
Dear me.

1527
01:15:32,736 --> 01:15:33,820
7HIGH

1528
01:15:36,073 --> 01:15:38,116
7high, your prediction has succeeded.

1529
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:49,002
KANG JI-YEONG

1530
01:15:54,633 --> 01:15:56,885
Kang Ji-yeong,
your prediction has succeeded.

1531
01:17:24,514 --> 01:17:29,519
