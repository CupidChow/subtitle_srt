1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,340
Let me shuffle the cards.

2
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,224
Wow, Hyun-gyu,
it must be hard to count all those Pieces.

3
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:21,521
Sitting here, I feel nervous.

4
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:23,773
I feel more nervous sitting than
when I'm standing.

5
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:25,525
It's nice.

6
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:28,153
Here are your five cards each.

7
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,471
The first player, Jeong Hyun-gyu,

8
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,097
please make your prediction
and place your bet.

9
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:58,224
Yes, I'll be back in three minutes.

10
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:00,602
My cards are ridiculous.

11
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:02,270
This is what I have.

12
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:04,481
You have a few of the same. I'm baffled.

13
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,274
-You have one of each?
-Yes, it's crazy, right?

14
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:07,692
-You don't have this?
-Yeah.

15
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:10,445
I have two yellows, one blue,
and one purple.

16
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:11,529
Is that three?

17
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:14,824
Two, three, four, two, three, one.

18
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,078
-We have nothing to go for. It's tricky.
-It's tricky.

19
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,496
It's tough.

20
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:21,456
-Right.
-Let's do this quickly.

21
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:25,126
We have three purples plus two, so seven?

22
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,711
-Yes.
-I'll go with seven.

23
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:27,796
Okay.

24
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,135
You have two minutes left.

25
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,347
It's seven, right? Eleven…

26
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,516
I will go with seven purples.

27
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,477
You have predicted seven purples.

28
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,686
Seven purples?

29
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:45,897
Please place your bet as well.

30
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:48,691
I will wager 11 Pieces.

31
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:52,278
Hyun-gyu, you're scaring me.

32
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,535
Want to have another chat?

33
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:01,788
So he's gone for seven purples.

34
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:04,290
But to be frank,
seven purples is a pretty safe bet.

35
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:05,792
Right, that's playing it safe.

36
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,002
But if you're worried,

37
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:11,840
we can accept it and stick with purple,
and you change it to green on your turn.

38
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,967
Choi Hyun-joon, do you accept?

39
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,593
Don't be scared. It's only a game.

40
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:16,803
-I accept.
-That's right, man!

41
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:18,304
Choi Hyun-joon, you have accepted.

42
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,140
Please make your prediction
and place your bet.

43
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:24,102
I'll stick with purple
and raise it to eight.

44
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:26,479
You have predicted eight purples.

45
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:29,149
Yes, and I will bet one Piece.

46
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:31,025
Son Eun-yu, do you accept?

47
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,235
I accept.

48
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:36,823
I predict nine purples,
and I'll wager one Piece.

49
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:38,324
You're going to bet one Piece?

50
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,160
7high, do you accept?

51
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:42,203
I accept.

52
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:44,914
I accept for sure.

53
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,750
7high, please make your prediction
and place your bet.

54
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:53,423
I will go with ten greens.

55
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:56,426
-He's changed it.
-Green.

56
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,555
You have predicted ten greens.

57
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:06,019
Accept it.
Pass it on to me, and let's end it.

58
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,103
Okay, I'll accept.

59
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,022
Shall I give you one,
or will you give one to me?

60
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:10,607
-I'll give it to you.
-Okay, then just…

61
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,859
say 30 blues or something, for a laugh.

62
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,444
-30 blues? Okay.
-Done.

63
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,821
I will accept.

64
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,531
I look honest, right?

65
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,575
-Yes.
-I've been recognized as an honest player.

66
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:21,659
I'll accept.

67
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,870
Please make your prediction
and place your bet.

68
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:26,873
I will go with 30 blues.

69
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:29,542
You may not predict more than 20 cards.

70
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,336
That's taking it too far.

71
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,796
I know you're playing as a team,
but you can't just hand it to him.

72
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,592
Thirty blues? You're looking out for
each other too obviously. It's too much.

73
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:40,178
Honestly, 30 is just too much.

74
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:43,181
I'll bet one Piece.

75
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:44,474
-You have bet one.
-Yes.

76
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:47,018
-Jeong Hyun-gyu, do you accept?
-I'll doubt.

77
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:48,603
You have doubted. Please place your bet.

78
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,396
I'll call.

79
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,233
Jeong Hyun-gyu, you have bet one Piece.

80
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:57,070
Starting with 7high,
please reveal your cards.

81
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,906
What if there are actually 20 blues?

82
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:03,159
Blue?

83
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:04,786
Blue?

84
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:12,543
Made it. You could have had me
if you wanted.

85
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:16,047
Jeong Hyun-gyu, your doubt was successful.

86
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,465
Here is your Piece.

87
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,639
The order of play…

88
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:26,516
-It's good that it's like this.
-It's not bad.

89
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:31,604
It's good because you can reset
and we can just do one Piece each.

90
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:33,815
That was too much.

91
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,235
Here are your cards.

92
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:43,449
My cards are great.

93
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,371
The first player, Yoon So-hui,

94
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,707
please make your prediction
and place your bet.

95
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,542
Hey, we're in trouble.

96
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,919
If they play like that,
we're going to struggle.

97
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:57,797
-What shall we do? Seven blues?
-Not sure.

98
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,550
-What? Yes, let's do that.
-Seven reds?

99
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,593
No, I have to raise one.
Let's go with six.

100
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:03,845
Do it.

101
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:08,224
I will bet on six blues.

102
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,309
You have bet one Piece.

103
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,019
How many blues? Six?

104
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:12,687
I accept.

105
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,023
Please make your prediction
and place your bet.

106
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:17,233
On seven blues,

107
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,819
I will bet four Pieces.

108
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:22,238
-Can you give her a Piece?
-How?

109
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,364
We need to end it.

110
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:27,035
If they play like that,
it will go eight, nine, ten,

111
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:29,787
and So-hui will doubt for sure,
then we'll get caught out.

112
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,706
So give a Piece.
She can give it back later.

113
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,958
-Accept Hyun-gyu's bid. I'll--
-You want to doubt me?

114
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,419
I'll doubt you
after you predict something stupid.

115
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:37,837
I accept.

116
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,715
I'll go with 20 blues.

117
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:43,885
-You have predicted 20 blues.
-I cannot accept that.

118
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,303
You're so suspicious.

119
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:46,512
Well, I am a lawyer.

120
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:49,057
Son Eun-yu, your doubt was successful.

121
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,683
Here is your Piece.

122
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:51,768
Thank you.

123
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,355
Round 3 will now begin.
Here are your cards.

124
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:58,941
Please do me a solid
and give me some decent cards.

125
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,777
The first player, Choi Hyun-joon,

126
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,570
please make your prediction
and place your bet.

127
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:04,030
Hey, we have five reds?

128
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:06,324
Yes, so it'll be not bad to bet on red.

129
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,409
-We don't have many yellows.
-Do we have one yellow?

130
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,328
-Are we going to bluff on that?
-Could do that.

131
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:12,830
We can bluff so that So-hui takes the hit.

132
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:15,041
We could. Give it a try. You'll be okay.

133
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,086
This is an important moment.

134
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,462
Four, five, six, seven.

135
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,547
Let's turn the round over
and help each other out.

136
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,925
-Well, let's see what 7high does.
-Okay.

137
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:26,427
So how many?
What number do we want on So-hui's turn?

138
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,471
Let's make it four.

139
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:32,809
Because they might have five yellows
between them, or four, right?

140
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,060
-Right.
-Yes.

141
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,353
-Then--
-Hey, don't do that.

142
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:38,606
We have to get her this time.
So we need to raise the number.

143
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,316
-Then do five.
-Yeah, five.

144
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,401
Okay.

145
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,530
I will bet on five yellows.

146
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:48,950
I accept.

147
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:51,411
I'll bet on six yellows.

148
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:55,373
-I accept.
-You have accepted.

149
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:57,625
7high, please make your prediction.

150
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,211
They wouldn't have done that
without having any yellows.

151
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:03,047
-Should I doubt?
-If they go with seven.

152
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:05,299
Seven yellows.

153
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,095
Yes, call it.

154
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:11,055
Then how many Pieces shall I do
after calling?

155
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,515
How many shall I do? Two?

156
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:13,683
Raise two.

157
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:14,809
-Raise two?
-Yes.

158
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,025
I'll doubt.

159
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,862
You have doubted. Please place your bet.

160
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,576
You've been doubted.

161
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:32,660
One Piece.

162
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:35,037
-And you have bet an additional Piece.
-Yes.

163
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,789
7high, please place your bet.

164
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,752
Give me a second to think.

165
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:46,174
Is there any chance
they have four yellows?

166
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,760
-It's very low. Very low.
-Well, it is possible.

167
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:52,346
It is. Also, don't forget
about the rainbow cards.

168
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,098
No, we can't do that,

169
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:57,894
because I think they wouldn't have
bet on us not having any yellows.

170
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,937
They're just trying to catch us out.

171
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,482
So-hui.

172
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:06,736
You get them.

173
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:10,448
I'll fold.

174
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:12,033
-Will you fold?
-Yes.

175
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:14,076
Yoon So-hui, your doubt was successful.

176
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:20,041
Please return your cards
without revealing them.

177
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:22,376
-I'm curious.
-No, this is certain.

178
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,051
This game is fun.

179
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:31,969
Our places are making it more fun, huh?

180
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:33,513
The heavens helped me.

181
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:34,764
Round 4 will now begin.

182
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,140
The first player, 7high,

183
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,142
please make your prediction
and place your bet.

184
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:41,395
I will bet on nine greens.

185
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:43,689
You have bet two Pieces.

186
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:46,108
-We only have three greens.
-We have three.

187
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,360
-Let's just skip this one.
-Okay.

188
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:48,694
Yes, I accept.

189
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:51,656
I'll go with 15 greens.

190
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,366
Fifteen greens.

191
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:54,784
I'll doubt.

192
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,411
-They're ending it.
-Exactly.

193
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,998
With two people sitting
next to each other,

194
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:05,628
they can swap Pieces easily
with minimal attrition.

195
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:08,381
And they can end a round at any point.

196
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,136
Here are your cards.

197
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:26,274
The first player, Yoon So-hui,

198
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:28,651
please make your prediction
and place your bet.

199
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,321
I'm not getting good cards,

200
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,615
my strategy is shot
and I'm having no luck at all.

201
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,450
Let's see. You're really having no luck.

202
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:37,827
I'm having no luck with my cards.

203
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:41,622
One got a lot of one color, but
how come ours are so evenly distributed?

204
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,291
Why does this keep happening?

205
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:46,168
We have a ton of reds.
It'll be more than seven reds for sure.

206
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,005
Go for it. Do anything.

207
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,716
-Do one red.
-You want me to do one red?

208
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,301
I think they got a lot of reds.

209
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,970
I will go with one red.

210
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:58,973
You have predicted one red.

211
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:00,182
I'd better increase red.

212
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,892
-Yes, we can just increase red.
-Yes, okay.

213
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:05,104
-Jeong Hyun-gyu, do you accept?
-I accept.

214
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,523
Please make your prediction
and place your bet.

215
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,612
I will go with 11 yellows.

216
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:15,781
You have predicted 11 yellows.

217
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,408
-Get him.
-Get him.

218
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:18,492
-Quick.
-We have one yellow.

219
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,036
If he doesn't, he's dead.

220
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,370
I will bet as many as I can.

221
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,414
You have bet ten Pieces.

222
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:25,833
Choi Hyun-joon, do you accept?

223
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,501
Hyun-joon definitely won't do it.

224
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,587
No way they thought this through.

225
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,088
-We only have one of these.
-Exactly.

226
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:32,548
Hey, we have to get him now.

227
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,883
We've got him.

228
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:34,967
Why is that?

229
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,054
How many does he have?

230
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,264
Okay.

231
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:43,142
Hey, he screwed up. We've got him.

232
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:45,478
-Calm down.
-Hey, I'm so happy.

233
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:49,607
If you're wrong, you're losing Pieces.

234
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:53,653
-We have three yellows, right?
-Yes.

235
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:55,988
Their yellows…

236
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,657
So eight yellows…

237
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,158
-They might have.
-They have four rainbows.

238
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:02,370
I think they have a lot of rainbows,
so they just went for it.

239
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:04,455
They have many rainbows
and maybe three or four yellows.

240
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:06,082
I don't think
they'd have a lot of yellows.

241
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,249
I don't think so either.

242
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,001
You have 30 seconds left.

243
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,878
But we have to go for it.

244
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:13,381
They need to have a total
of eight yellows and rainbows

245
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:14,674
among their ten cards.

246
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:19,053
-The probability is quite low.
-Yes, the odds are really low.

247
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,179
Do you accept it?

248
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,807
-I think you should doubt and call it.
-You decide.

249
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,100
-Well, you decide.
-Okay.

250
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:44,412
I'll accept it for now. I'll accept it.

251
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,416
Okay, but it's a shame.

252
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,710
Still, you do what you want.
It's your decision.

253
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,294
Choi Hyun-joon, do you accept?

254
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,133
I accept.

255
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,300
You have accepted.

256
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,635
Jeong Hyun-gyu,
please take your Pieces back.

257
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,512
They're falling apart.

258
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,102
Choi Hyun-joon, please make
your prediction and place your bet.

259
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:10,521
-I don't know anymore.
-What shall I do?

260
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:14,275
-Let's discuss it. We have three minutes.
-Well, we have to bring it to a close now.

261
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,779
Then shall we give and take a Piece
among ourselves? Just like earlier?

262
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,031
-We'll take back one.
-Let's finish to go to the next round.

263
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,992
-I think that'll be better. Okay?
-It's all out anyway.

264
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:25,619
I will go for 20 yellows.

265
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:28,539
You have predicted 20 yellows.

266
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,501
You have bet one Piece.

267
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,670
Then, I may lose another Piece?

268
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:36,964
-Eun-yu?
-What? Yeah.

269
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:38,674
One of us will have to give you one.

270
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,634
But that leaves me with too few Pieces.

271
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:43,846
Otherwise I'll have to give one away.
So do it for now, and on the next turn…

272
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,183
It can't be helped. Are you okay with it?

273
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:50,853
If these positions don't change,
there's no chance for victory.

274
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,731
Well, I don't really have any choice.
I'll doubt.

275
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:55,524
-Are you just going to call?
-Yes.

276
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,693
Please reveal your cards.

277
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,320
Jeong Hyun-gyu, please reveal your cards.

278
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,168
-Wow, I almost died.
-You're right.

279
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,004
What a relief.

280
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:20,716
There was a chance for this to happen.

281
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,384
Son Eun-yu, your doubt was successful.

282
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,469
Okay.

283
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,265
Please return your cards.

284
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:34,855
But I think that really destroyed
Hyun-joon mentally.

285
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:35,940
I think so too.

286
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:37,942
He realized if he'd called,
he'd be going home.

287
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:41,028
Wow, I almost died.
I was almost on my way home.

288
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:43,531
I didn't think it through,
telling you to call on that.

289
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:46,408
-Well, I just had a bad feeling.
-Right, right.

290
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:47,910
Good call.

291
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,371
Given that we have to swap seats
after Round 10,

292
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:52,289
let's play it safe for now.

293
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,041
Round 6 will now begin.

294
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:55,751
I will go with nine greens.

295
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,378
-I'll doubt with one Piece.
-Jeong Hyun-gyu.

296
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:58,546
-You have doubted.
-Yes.

297
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,506
Please reveal your cards.

298
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:02,424
Jeong Hyun-gyu, your doubt has failed.

299
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,260
I will give the Piece to Yoon So-hui.

300
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,803
Round 7 will now begin.

301
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:10,057
Yes, I accept,
and I'll go with 11 purples.

302
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,475
Yoon So-hui, you have accepted.

303
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,560
I'll doubt.

304
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,061
They're ending it.

305
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:16,021
-They're ending it. Yes. I knew it.
-I knew it.

306
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,066
Jeong Hyun-gyu, your doubt has failed.

307
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,734
The Pieces go to Yoon So-hui.

308
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,319
Here are your cards.

309
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,916
Jeong Hyun-gyu, please make
your prediction and place your bet.

310
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:44,675
-My cards are okay. How are yours?
-What the heck?

311
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:46,594
-What's this? Is it this?
-Purples and yellows.

312
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:49,179
Yes, this.
Well, I'm going to have to go with this.

313
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,140
I'll try and hit them with this.

314
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,102
I'll bet one Piece on six reds.

315
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:57,438
He said six reds.

316
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,648
-Just accept it and pass it on.
-Yes.

317
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:00,733
The red.

318
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:03,861
I think there could be six reds.

319
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:08,741
-There probably are six reds, so accept--
-I don't think there are.

320
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:09,825
Hey, call him on it.

321
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,994
They're assuming
that six is a safe number.

322
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,830
If they had them,
they would've betted a lot.

323
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,290
That's how they've played.

324
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:17,583
No way they predicted…

325
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,501
-We have one.
-…that we only have one.

326
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:20,836
-Call it.
-Let's get them.

327
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,547
-It's five. They must have five cards.
-We have…

328
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,341
-Five?
-If you lose, it's one.

329
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,927
Still, five reds and rainbows
do come out quite often.

330
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,887
You think
they've just gone for total safety?

331
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,640
Yes, Hyun-gyu could have bet
on a number that he actually has.

332
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,975
But in that case,
we're just passing it on.

333
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,227
We'll be just playing as they want us to.

334
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,272
-I reckon we have to get So-hui first.
-Hyun-joon, one minute left.

335
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:43,525
-Our strategy must be to get So-hui first.
-Yes. So I'll pass it to you.

336
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,486
Passing it on
so you can get So-hui is the best…

337
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:47,404
-Seriously.
-How? They call everything.

338
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,823
Just wait and see.
There will definitely be six.

339
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,618
Hyun-gyu won't take any risks right now.

340
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,411
I'll accept.

341
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,538
If he accepts, you can get her.

342
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:57,790
I accept.

343
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:59,792
Choi Hyun-joon, you have accepted.

344
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,211
I will predict seven of the same color.

345
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,338
You're betting one Piece on seven reds.

346
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:05,464
-Correct?
-Yes.

347
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:09,677
I accept. I'll wager one Piece
on there being eight reds.

348
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,470
7high, do you accept?

349
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:12,805
I accept.

350
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,851
I will go for nine purples.

351
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,353
You have bet one slot chip.

352
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:21,397
Yoon So-hui, do you accept?

353
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,941
Shall we end it between the two of us?

354
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:27,653
-Purple is worth trying.
-How many purples should I die with?

355
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:29,738
-You want me to call him? 7high?
-Yes.

356
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,740
-Shall I doubt him? Okay, I will.
-Yes.

357
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,701
There probably aren't enough purples.

358
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,828
Let's leave it to fate.

359
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:37,287
Okay, I'll doubt.

360
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,331
Yoon So-hui, you have doubted.

361
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,666
Please make your bet.

362
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,001
-I will bet one.
-Okay.

363
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,585
-I got this.
-You have called with one.

364
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:44,837
That's a relief.

365
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,797
Son Eun-yu, please reveal your cards.

366
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,884
I thought it was high time
for them to make a mistake.

367
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,470
We've been playing it safe.

368
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:57,099
-Three.
-Choi Hyun-joon, please reveal your cards.

369
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,600
Four.

370
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,772
Jeong Hyun-gyu, please reveal your cards.

371
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:07,735
That was lucky.

372
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,446
-Hang on.
-Yoon So-hui, please reveal your cards.

373
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,824
-They don't have a single purple?
-They have one.

374
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:18,328
-I got it taken from me.
-7high, please reveal your cards.

375
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:29,006
-Isn't that perfect?
-Yoon So-hui, your doubt was successful.

376
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,508
-You're losing one. Just one.
-Nice.

377
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:34,470
-I'll exchange the slot chip for a Piece.
-You're losing one.

378
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:40,517
Do you have to give him two?

379
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:41,769
I'll doubt you.

380
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:42,936
I will fold.

381
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,481
You have folded.
The Pieces go to Choi Hyun-joon.

382
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:49,026
Things are back to how they were.

383
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,402
Round 10 will now begin.

384
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,117
The first player, Son Eun-yu,

385
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,702
please make your prediction
and place your bet.

386
00:17:58,786 --> 00:17:59,953
Okay.

387
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,288
My goodness.

388
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:03,957
Oh? We have quite a lot of blues.

389
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:12,508
If I start with yellows, you can switch
to blue and take a shot at So-hui.

390
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:14,760
In any case, right now…

391
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:17,137
But they might try and get us.

392
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:21,100
They might try to get us once more,
making use of this position.

393
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:24,311
Exactly. So I think we should just
pass it on with a safe call of five.

394
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,688
-Five? I'll just do six.
-Okay.

395
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:29,691
I don't know.

396
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:34,863
I will bet one Piece on five yellows.

397
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,324
You have bet one Piece.

398
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,576
7high, do you accept?

399
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:41,954
I accept.

400
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:44,665
7high, you have accepted.
Please make your prediction.

401
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:56,343
I will go for six blues.

402
00:18:56,927 --> 00:19:00,472
You have bet one chip on six blue cards.

403
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,724
What Eun-yu did doesn't mean anything.

404
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,144
-Yes, I think so too.
-Yes, we shouldn't even consider it.

405
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,396
When you start taking from us in Round 15,

406
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:10,149
do I get to choose what you take
or do you just take a Piece?

407
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,150
You will lose a Piece.

408
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,735
Hyun-joon will be too scared to do it.
I'll bet two.

409
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:14,820
Okay.

410
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:21,493
I accept.

411
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:22,911
Yoon So-hui, you have accepted.

412
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,913
Please make your prediction.

413
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,540
I will go for seven blues.

414
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:31,003
-You have bet one Piece on seven blues.
-Yes.

415
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:32,546
-I accept.
-You have accepted.

416
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,923
I will bet two Pieces on eight yellows.

417
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:38,135
You have bet two Pieces
on eight yellow cards.

418
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:40,596
Choi Hyun-joon, do you accept?

419
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,931
-They have to have six.
-Right, right.

420
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,725
But honestly,
there's no way that'd happen.

421
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:47,644
He bet two Pieces.
Do you want to try and go for it?

422
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:50,689
Listen. I'm fairly sure
I'm going to be leaving soon,

423
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:53,192
so I'll just be honest with you.

424
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,652
If you keep dragging it out like this,
you won't win anything.

425
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,112
Eun-yu, you'll end up dying.

426
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,281
You can't win this game unless you call.

427
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,866
They're just playing with you right now.

428
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:03,702
When they bet a lot and you fold.
They bet, you fold.

429
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,078
You keep accepting these.

430
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,414
That's the kind of mistake
that amateurs make.

431
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:09,082
-I'm telling you it's no good.
-Exactly.

432
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:12,294
-Well, come here a sec. See here.
-We need to mix things up.

433
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:16,089
They must think we have a lot of yellows
because we started betting with yellows.

434
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:19,468
And since they have a few yellows
and a few rainbows…

435
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:23,138
-Shall I call? I'll call.
-…they just raise the bid higher.

436
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,266
But what I'm wary of is,
he just bet two Pieces out of the blue.

437
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,643
That feels a bit off.

438
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:30,145
Perhaps he did that thinking
Hyun-joon would wimp out and accept?

439
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,022
Frankly, if we don't call now,
we can't call on anything.

440
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:33,523
-I'll call. Yes.
-Can you do it?

441
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,234
Well, I feel like this is the pinnacle.

442
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:37,194
-Exactly what I was thinking.
-This is a pinnacle moment.

443
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:39,988
Gosh. Hyun-gyu, you're good,
making it so thrilling.

444
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,241
I…

445
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:51,333
You have 30 seconds left.

446
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:55,170
I'll call.

447
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,088
Doubt.

448
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:58,340
-Would you like to doubt?
-Sorry?

449
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,425
You can only bet after raising a doubt.

450
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,177
-After doubting…
-After doubting, yes.

451
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,096
-Okay.
-Hey, do it with a bit of flair.

452
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:06,223
-"I'll doubt. I'll call."
-I'm just being cautious.

453
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:07,307
I'll doubt.

454
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:10,477
Starting with Yoon So-hui,
please reveal your cards.

455
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:22,155
Hey, I think we might have them.

456
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,116
-7high.
-We got them.

457
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,492
-Let's hustle up.
-Reveal your cards.

458
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:27,035
We'll know once we see our cards.

459
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:34,126
I have a fear that what happened earlier
will happen again.

460
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:36,336
Hyun-gyu was amazingly lucky earlier.

461
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,921
I was lucky too. That I accepted then.

462
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,965
-Well done.
-Choi Hyun-joon, please reveal your cards.

463
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,974
Jeong Hyun-gyu, please reveal your cards.

464
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:06,950
Choi Hyun-joon, your doubt has failed.

465
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:27,387
THE DEVIL'S PLAN
DEATH ROOM

466
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:29,264
Hey, really?

467
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,476
Choi Hyun-joon, your doubt has failed.

468
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,393
No way.

469
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,145
The Pieces go to Jeong Hyun-gyu.

470
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:37,064
But honestly,

471
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:40,609
Hyun-gyu is having unbelievable luck
with the cards today.

472
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,445
How is that even possible?

473
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:47,282
-How can that happen twice?
-How is that possible?

474
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:52,579
You will now draw lots
to determine your new positions.

475
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:54,122
I hope I get a good one.

476
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,167
7high, please draw a ball.

477
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:01,713
What have you got?

478
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,632
Four and five, wow.

479
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:04,883
God is on our side.

480
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:06,676
I'm number two.

481
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,303
Three.

482
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,431
How can they have so much luck?

483
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,731
So I can't really cooperate
with you guys in this round

484
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,108
like what I told you earlier.

485
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:23,276
I'm sorry.

486
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,364
If we carry on like this,
I'm going to end up dying.

487
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:28,365
I have no choice.

488
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:30,575
If we're stuck together in a row
as one, two, three,

489
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,369
there's nothing I can do in the middle.

490
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:35,288
If I try to do anything,
it would just be betraying Eun-yu.

491
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:37,582
Since I'd be going after
Eun-yu's Pieces, and I told her,

492
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,502
"If we stick together,
there's nothing we can do."

493
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:42,712
"We have to play individually."

494
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:45,882
That's what we ended up doing.

495
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,843
I have no choice.
There's nothing I can do.

496
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:50,929
What now? Shall we stick together?

497
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,013
Yes, we have to.

498
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,390
From 7high's point of view,

499
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:56,393
playing as an alliance
is just killing time until he leaves,

500
00:23:56,476 --> 00:24:01,148
and he was in the worst possible position
for being in an alliance with us,

501
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:04,734
so we accepted the fact
and decided not to play as a team anymore.

502
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:06,778
Round 11 will now begin.

503
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,906
-Good luck. Give it your all.
-Good luck.

504
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:17,914
The first player, Choi Hyun-joon,

505
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,666
please make your prediction
and place your bet.

506
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:23,420
My heart is breaking.

507
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:24,880
Our alliance is over.

508
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,548
-Sorry?
-I'm out of the alliance.

509
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,008
Remember that when you play.

510
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:31,011
We can just carry on as we have been.

511
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:34,264
If you go for three yellows…

512
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:36,641
If I kick off with three yellows,
Hyun-gyu will likely accept it

513
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:39,895
because normally we can expect
to have four.

514
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:42,355
7high is playing after me.

515
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,649
-Yes.
-You have to calculate what you can get.

516
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,776
Because if he and I go toe-to-toe,
between our chips,

517
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,987
-there isn't much of a difference.
-You have a minute left.

518
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,364
Okay, got it.
Yes, I'm ready to place my bet.

519
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:53,575
I will make my prediction for yellow

520
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:55,660
and bet one Piece
on there being three of them.

521
00:24:55,744 --> 00:25:00,790
Accept it and go for six blues.
No, seven is worth a try.

522
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,125
Then let's try seven.

523
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:04,085
-But just risk one Piece.
-Okay.

524
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:07,255
In any case, we have to play
until our numbers dwindle.

525
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:11,009
So ultimately, this is a game
where you have to doubt on others' bluffs.

526
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:13,512
If you only ever go with accepting,
the game will never end.

527
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,096
But what if they never try to bluff?

528
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,181
They can for now,

529
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:18,016
but once I'm out, things will change.

530
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:20,227
Stop saying you're leaving.

531
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,895
-Do you accept?
-I accept.

532
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:23,313
Jeong Hyun-gyu, you have accepted.

533
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:25,190
Please make your prediction
and place your bet.

534
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:28,151
I will bet one Piece
on there being four reds.

535
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:29,319
Yes, I accept.

536
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:30,403
You have accepted.

537
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:33,615
I will go for seven blues.

538
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,992
-How many Pieces would you like to bet?
-I will bet one.

539
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,161
Give us a minute.

540
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:43,333
No, we have two blues. The three of them…

541
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:45,919
But they have no reason to bluff.

542
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:50,590
However, if I just accept it,
7high will end up taking a Piece off me.

543
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:52,926
But if we call it here,

544
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:55,053
you might end up losing one to So-hui.

545
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:55,971
Right.

546
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,847
You have to choose who you'll give it to.

547
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:02,978
I accept.

548
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,729
Son Eun-yu, you have accepted.

549
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:07,399
Son Eun-yu, please make
your prediction and place your bet.

550
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:09,234
I will bet on eight yellows.

551
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:11,069
-You have bet one Piece.
-Yes.

552
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:13,280
7high, do you accept?

553
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,409
I'll doubt.

554
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:19,119
You have doubted. Please place your bet.

555
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:20,996
I'm going all-in.

556
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:25,709
You have bet one Piece
and three slot chips.

557
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:29,421
Son Eun-yu, please place your bet.

558
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:32,173
So I go all-in.

559
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,675
It's just you left.

560
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,802
Now, do you think you can call?

561
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:37,846
-It's not easy.
-Right.

562
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,848
To be honest,
the strategy of going all-in…

563
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:42,142
You only use it against someone
who'd feel the pressure.

564
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:48,773
Do you have a lot of yellows?

565
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:50,900
-Me?
-Yes.

566
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:55,614
Fourteen cards.

567
00:26:56,573 --> 00:27:00,910
If my cards were a little better,
I might have risked it.

568
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:03,413
But the probability,
based on my cards, was so low

569
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:05,415
that I thought
I shouldn't risk everything.

570
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,125
I'll fold.

571
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,251
You have folded.

572
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:10,378
The Pieces go to 7high.

573
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,130
To tell the truth, I had some yellows.

574
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:13,923
To be honest, if Eun-yu had called,

575
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:16,635
there was a high probability
that she would win.

576
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:19,763
So you can look at it two ways.
Of course, I went all-in to save myself.

577
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:22,557
But also, if I was called on my bluff,

578
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:26,102
then I'd be helping Eun-yu,
who has trusted me all along

579
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:27,896
and played with me as a team.

580
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:31,858
If things had carried on as they were,
both of us would have been eliminated.

581
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:34,194
-I'd like to buy a slot.
-Okay, please give me one Piece.

582
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:36,613
Here are your cards.

583
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:40,033
-How did our positions come out like this?
-That's what I'm saying.

584
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,744
Do we draw lots every ten rounds?

585
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,829
The first player, Son Eun-yu,

586
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,748
please make your prediction
and place your bet.

587
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:49,334
We have a lot of breathing space,
so let's see what happens.

588
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,294
I'm going to call four reds.

589
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:55,799
So if 7high changes the color
and increases it by one or even a lot--

590
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:57,384
Then we can change the color.

591
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:58,510
Then we can doubt.

592
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:00,303
We can change to yellow.

593
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,806
-Son Eun-yu, please make your prediction.
-Okay.

594
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:04,766
I will go for four reds.

595
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:07,644
-You have bet one Piece on four red cards.
-Yes.

596
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:10,105
-7high, do you accept?
-I accept.

597
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,564
7high, please make your prediction.

598
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,441
I will go with five blues.

599
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,402
You have predicted five blues.

600
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:17,862
-I accept.
-You have accepted.

601
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:22,659
I will bet one Piece
on there being seven yellows.

602
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:24,452
-I accept.
-You have accepted.

603
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,663
I will bet one Piece on eight yellows.

604
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:28,665
-I accept.
-You have accepted.

605
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:31,418
I will bet one Piece on nine greens.

606
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:32,836
You have bet one Piece.

607
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:35,714
-Nine greens?
-Son Eun-yu, do you accept?

608
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:37,424
My position sucks.

609
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:38,800
I accept that.

610
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:40,385
What are you considering?

611
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:42,303
I'm thinking of doubting.

612
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,431
Do you think it'll be successful?

613
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:45,432
Because we have--

614
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:47,350
-We have four greens.
-Four, right.

615
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:49,185
So they must have five.

616
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,271
So, for your doubt to be successful,

617
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:53,898
they can't have more than four.

618
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:56,484
-If I don't doubt and just carry on?
-Yes.

619
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,903
Then do I just go for ten yellows?

620
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,572
-In yellow?
-Yes.

621
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,240
I'm not sure about that.

622
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:03,825
-Then 7high will doubt me again.
-Exactly.

623
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:05,452
-And go all-in again.
-Probably.

624
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:06,828
So I'll keep losing Pieces.

625
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:09,998
Mr. Dealer, is this
what it'd feel like to starve to death?

626
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:13,376
I'm so sad.

627
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,794
I wish you good luck.

628
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:19,257
-Let me try my luck.
-Nine, eight…

629
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,092
-I'll doubt.
-Would you like to doubt?

630
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:23,678
-You have bet one Piece.
-Yes.

631
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:27,432
Starting with Jeong Hyun-gyu,
please reveal your cards.

632
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:32,812
7high, please reveal your cards.

633
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:42,322
Yoon So-hui, please reveal your cards.

634
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,369
Son Eun-yu, your doubt has failed.

635
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:52,791
You keep going all-in.
I don't really have a choice right now.

636
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:57,629
Dang, this here is the seat of death.
It's lethal.

637
00:29:57,712 --> 00:30:00,757
I mean, it's day six, and they made it
so that I yearn for prison.

638
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,759
Right, going to prison
means your survival.

639
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:04,594
I want to go back to prison.

640
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:06,763
I really wanted to see
the living area though.

641
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:09,057
You did. At the beginning
when we introduced ourselves.

642
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,266
Are you kidding me?

643
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,602
You introduced yourself very confidently.

644
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:14,521
Round 13 will now begin.

645
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:15,897
Let's do this.

646
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:18,024
Thank you.

647
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:19,442
The first player, Son Eun-yu,

648
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:21,194
please make your prediction
and place your bet.

649
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:25,698
I'm going to do five reds.

650
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,617
Then 7high will probably do six.

651
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,744
But he might raise it more.

652
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:32,664
Come to think of it,
it's meaningless for us to talk like this

653
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:33,957
since 7high is between us.

654
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,792
Yeah, right. This is so annoying.

655
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:37,585
So me going first
is completely meaningless.

656
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:41,005
-You have one minute left.
-Okay.

657
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:44,133
I will go for seven reds.

658
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,469
-You have bet one Piece.
-And I will bet one.

659
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:48,137
7high, do you accept?

660
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:50,473
I accept. I'll go with eight reds.

661
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:52,809
Choi Hyun-joon, do you accept?

662
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,897
It's definitely hard playing by myself

663
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:58,982
with no information.

664
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:01,609
It's hard playing as a duo too
when we're seated like this.

665
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:04,487
Yes, I accept.

666
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:05,864
-You have accepted.
-Yes.

667
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:07,824
Please make your prediction.

668
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:09,367
7high, can we talk for a minute?

669
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:12,495
So, I understand you
not working with us on the last turn,

670
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:14,914
but wouldn't it be okay
to share on this turn?

671
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,876
After all, it's Hyun-joon versus them.
Can't you share cards this turn?

672
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,878
-You have to go for nine, right?
-Yes.

673
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:22,922
Okay, I'll share. Here.

674
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:25,925
-Two reds.
-I'm just helping you here.

675
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,805
You're good at this. Geez.

676
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:33,224
I gave you a Piece earlier, old man.

677
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:35,518
It was taken from me.

678
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:38,688
I will bet one Piece on ten reds.

679
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:40,773
Jeong Hyun-gyu, do you accept?

680
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:42,191
Just a moment.

681
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,905
Why did he raise red by two?

682
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:50,783
I'm sure he doesn't have enough,
but why raise it by two? I'll go for it.

683
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,744
I'll doubt with one Piece.

684
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:55,830
Starting with Yoon So-hui,
please reveal your cards.

685
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:03,087
Jeong Hyun-gyu.

686
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:10,136
-You should've just done nine.
-Your doubt was successful.

687
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:12,805
-I was just trying to go a little more.
-A little more?

688
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:15,308
Shall we try and take Eun-yu's?

689
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:16,893
Gosh, that big jerk.

690
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,189
How many Pieces do you have?

691
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:23,232
Hang on a sec.

692
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:26,611
"Hang on a sec"? I'm so envious.

693
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:29,447
Rich people never know
their bank balance from what I've heard.

694
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:30,823
I see. Right.

695
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,617
This is a microcosm of society.

696
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,577
Round 14 will now begin.

697
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:36,037
Is it already Round 14?

698
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,622
AFTER ROUND 15, PLAYERS
RETURN 1 PIECE EVERY 5 ROUNDS

699
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:40,500
-We lose a Piece in 15 and 25?
-In Rounds 15, 20, 25, 30, and onward.

700
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:42,293
-We keep losing Pieces?
-Multiples of five.

701
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:44,295
-I'm screwed.
-Let's go!

702
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,842
The first player, Choi Hyun-joon,

703
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,928
please make your prediction
and place your bet.

704
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:55,848
Okay.

705
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,350
The least that we should go with is eight.

706
00:32:57,433 --> 00:33:00,228
I just checked,
and the average is correct.

707
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:02,605
-Right.
-If I'd gone for 9, I would've gotten it.

708
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:04,524
-So we have to be careful from 10 onwards.
-True.

709
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:06,150
-So what are you going to do?
-Six?

710
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:07,610
Shall I just do six blues?

711
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:08,736
Isn't that risky?

712
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:15,952
I will bet on six greens,
and I'll bet one Piece.

713
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:17,954
-I accept.
-You have accepted.

714
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:19,122
Please take your Piece back.

715
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:22,291
I will increase it by one for red.

716
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:24,210
-You have bet one Piece.
-Yes.

717
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:25,294
I accept.

718
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:26,462
-You have accepted.
-Yes.

719
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:29,340
I will go for eight blues.

720
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,343
Did she just do eight blues?

721
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,554
-Eight blues.
-Eight blues.

722
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:36,264
We're desperate for 7high's hand.

723
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,599
I believe in the odds. You'll be fine.

724
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:39,517
Trust the odds?

725
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,811
Yes, it's the only thing you can count on.

726
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,105
I accept.

727
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,690
-You have accepted.
-Yes.

728
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:47,483
Please take your Piece back.

729
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,944
Son Eun-yu, please make
your prediction and place your bet.

730
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,404
I will go for…

731
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:53,865
nine yellows.

732
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:57,869
You have bet one Piece
on nine yellow cards.

733
00:33:57,952 --> 00:33:58,786
Yes.

734
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,747
7high, do you accept?

735
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:04,125
Should we share our cards with 7high?

736
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,503
If we suggest teaming up,
will he go for it?

737
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:09,130
No, we're just going to tell him.

738
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:11,758
That we have two yellows
and he can use that information?

739
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,426
I can take some time to think, right?

740
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:14,594
-Just a moment.
-Of course.

741
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:18,139
-Are we really going to tell him?
-Yes.

742
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:22,018
I want to see them
fighting among themselves

743
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:23,770
in fear of their survival.

744
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:26,439
We have two yellows.

745
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:29,776
Use that however you want…

746
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:32,111
There must be a reason
Eun-yu made that bet.

747
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:36,699
I'm sure it reflected the number
of yellow cards they had between them.

748
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:41,120
So I thought
they probably had five or six.

749
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:49,212
7high's scary side…

750
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:52,381
I won't accept that.

751
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:54,592
-Would you like to doubt?
-I'll doubt.

752
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,260
Please place your bet.

753
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:02,600
You have bet one Piece
and four slot cards for a total of five.

754
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:04,393
I thought it was fifty-fifty.

755
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:07,230
When I did the math,
I saw there was a slight chance for me.

756
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:09,607
So I took the chance and went all-in.

757
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,738
Son Eun-yu, please place your bet.

758
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:28,668
I must have

759
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:31,003
above-average luck at least,
don't you think?

760
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,133
I'll call.

761
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:36,467
I'll call.

762
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:37,677
I'll call.

763
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,762
-Son Eun-yu, you have called.
-How many do you have?

764
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,639
I think it's right on the line.

765
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:43,266
It'll be eight or nine.

766
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:45,059
Please reveal your cards.

767
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:48,604
Damn it.

768
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:53,276
Choi Hyun-joon, please reveal your cards.

769
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,283
Wow.

770
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:02,869
7high, please reveal your cards.

771
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:12,628
Son Eun-yu, please reveal your cards.

772
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:28,311
7high, your doubt was successful.

773
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:31,939
I really agonized over it.

774
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:34,984
When I calculated it,
the odds were really similar.

775
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:38,154
I did it anyway because it was Round 15,

776
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:41,574
and from then on, we would be losing
one Piece every five rounds.

777
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:46,078
Besides, if 7high and I
kept having a similar number of Pieces,

778
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:48,414
both of us would end up being eliminated.

779
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:52,752
But this way, one of us
would end up doubling our Pieces.

780
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:57,131
I thought whichever of us survived
would have enough to take them on.

781
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:01,052
You went all-in, so I had no choice.

782
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,680
Is this Round 15?

783
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:06,182
That is correct. It's Round 15.

784
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:09,477
AFTER ROUND 15, PLAYERS
RETURN 1 PIECE EVERY 5 ROUNDS

785
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,436
It was such a shame.

786
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:12,605
When Round 15 is over,
it would be the end for me.

787
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,024
Can we talk for a moment?

788
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:20,821
Can you help me
so I can play just five more rounds?

789
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:23,449
I really wanted to play
just five more rounds.

790
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:25,952
I thought I'd really regret it
if I didn't do that.

791
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:29,413
Like, "I left such a fun game
because I was ashamed to ask that?"

792
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:30,539
-Can you doubt me?
-Doubt you?

793
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,875
Doubt me.
I'll say something really ridiculous.

794
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:35,044
-Just for this turn.
-I can do that for you. Yes, okay.

795
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:37,672
I'll regret so much if I leave like this.

796
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:40,591
-Okay, I can do that much for you.
-Thanks.

797
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:44,053
I will go for one purple.

798
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:45,972
-Please place your bet.
-I will bet a Piece.

799
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:47,265
You have bet one Piece.

800
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:49,267
-I'll doubt.
-You have doubted.

801
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,852
-Thanks, it's the last favor I'll ask.
-Don't mention it.

802
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:54,230
7high, your doubt has failed.

803
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:56,232
The Pieces go to Son Eun-yu.

804
00:37:57,483 --> 00:37:59,652
That concludes Round 15.

805
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:03,072
Please return one Piece each.

806
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:04,657
Gosh.

807
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,701
Is there any way?

808
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:09,036
Even if we both really raise the numbers,

809
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,788
they're not going to let just pass on it.

810
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:14,583
All we have to do is expand the pot.
So-hui can pass to me with a big number.

811
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,043
Then, I can doubt it.

812
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,795
But she has no reason to do that anymore.

813
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:20,339
You'll die soon anyway,
so why would she do that?

814
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:23,884
Round 16 will now begin.

815
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,261
The first player, 7high,

816
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:27,388
please make your prediction
and place your bet.

817
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,557
I will go for four reds.

818
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:33,144
You have bet one slot chip
on four red cards.

819
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:34,270
Choi Hyun-joon.

820
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:36,564
-I accept.
-Please make your prediction.

821
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:39,108
I will bet one Piece on six yellows.

822
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:40,109
I accept.

823
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:41,736
Jeong Hyun-gyu, you have accepted.

824
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:42,945
Please make your prediction.

825
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,363
Shall I give it to you or take it?

826
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:45,364
You take it.

827
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:46,365
-I take it?
-Yes.

828
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:48,701
I will bet one Piece on seven yellows.

829
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:50,077
I'll doubt.

830
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,121
You have doubted. Please place your bet.

831
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:54,498
I'll bet one.

832
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,250
Please reveal your cards.

833
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:59,128
Yoon So-hui, your doubt has failed.

834
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:01,047
The Pieces go to Jeong Hyun-gyu.

835
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:04,467
Well, even now,
Hyun-gyu is resolute and stable.

836
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,719
He's just preparing for the final.

837
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,434
Round 17 will now begin.

838
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:15,311
The first player, Yoon So-hui,

839
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:17,563
please make your prediction
and place your bet.

840
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:20,316
Is there really nothing I can do?

841
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:24,362
If they accept on either side of me,
there's nothing I can do.

842
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,822
If I want to get a chip…

843
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:31,410
I will bet one Piece on seven yellows.

844
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:33,537
Son Eun-yu, do you accept?

845
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,206
Hyun-joon, can I see your cards?

846
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,542
Good luck. What do you have?

847
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,419
-Blue.
-I see.

848
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:43,589
Yes, I accept.

849
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:45,257
Son Eun-yu, please make your prediction.

850
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:50,137
Well, the expected odds have changed
now that I'm down to one card.

851
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:53,265
I'll predict nine yellows.

852
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:55,101
7high, do you accept?

853
00:39:57,686 --> 00:39:59,397
If he accepts,
you can get a Piece, Hyun-joon.

854
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:03,317
Why did they predict seven?

855
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:09,031
I accept.

856
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:11,158
-You're not giving me a chance.
-Take your Piece.

857
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,701
I will go for ten yellows.

858
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:15,204
You have bet one Piece
on ten yellow cards.

859
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:16,997
Choi Hyun-joon, do you accept?

860
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:19,917
-I'll doubt.
-You have doubted.

861
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,794
Ten is unlikely because of me.

862
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:23,379
I think it's possible.

863
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:24,505
I'll bet one.

864
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:26,090
-You have called one.
-Yes.

865
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:29,135
Starting with Yoon So-hui,
please reveal your cards.

866
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,818
I'm really curious what 7high's got.

867
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:52,324
Choi Hyun-joon, your doubt has failed.

868
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:53,617
It's betrayed by the odds.

869
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,077
Yes, it is.

870
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:59,915
There's nothing I can do
in this situation.

871
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:04,295
"If I didn't win something
in the five rounds, I'd be finished."

872
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:06,380
"But they were not giving me any chance."

873
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:10,342
I thought it was a bit of a catch-22.

874
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:12,011
Round 18 will now begin.

875
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:14,138
I will bet on four greens.

876
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:15,890
-I accept.
-You have accepted.

877
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:17,516
I will bet on 20 reds.

878
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,226
You're just speeding through the rounds.

879
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,439
Wow, it's so humiliating.

880
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:25,691
-I'll doubt.
-You have doubted.

881
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:28,152
Yoon So-hui, your doubt was successful.

882
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:31,822
This is so degrading.
There's literally nothing we can do.

883
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:34,450
Round 19 will now begin.

884
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:37,328
The first player, Jeong Hyun-gyu,
please make your prediction.

885
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:39,413
-I think we should get rid of her ASAP.
-Right?

886
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:42,082
Yes, in this round.
We must reduce the number of players.

887
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:46,462
I will bet one Piece on three reds.

888
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:49,298
-You've bet one Piece on three red cards.
-Yes.

889
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:51,133
Yoon So-hui, do you accept?

890
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:52,510
I accept.

891
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:55,429
Yoon So-hui, you have accepted.
Please make your prediction.

892
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:59,517
I will bet one Piece on five greens.

893
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,977
You have bet one Piece
on five green cards.

894
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:04,271
Son Eun-yu, do you accept?

895
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,483
-Yes.
-Son Eun-yu, you have accepted.

896
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:09,485
Please make your prediction.

897
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:13,656
Hyun-joon, can I look?

898
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:17,326
I realized that it would be harmful
to Hyun-joon's strategy

899
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:20,079
if he showed me his cards.

900
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:24,416
Whatever I bet would reveal
Hyun-joon's hand to some extent

901
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,918
because I only had one card.

902
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:30,172
So at some point, I started feeling bad
about asking to see his cards.

903
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:34,718
If I wanted to find a winning move,
I had to check at least one thing.

904
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:36,053
Are you going to accept?

905
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:37,805
Don't be like that.

906
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:41,016
If you're going to accept it anyway,
there's no need for me to think.

907
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,852
If I think you're wrong,
I won't hesitate to doubt you.

908
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:46,897
You have 30 seconds left.

909
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:54,071
I will predict that there are ten yellows.

910
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:55,739
You have predicted ten yellows.

911
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,032
Ten?

912
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,661
As you only have one Piece remaining,
please bet one.

913
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:02,830
I thought if I did nine,
7high would accept it.

914
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:06,417
So I thought that to make him play,
I had no choice but to go for ten.

915
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,169
I just took a gamble
and hoped I'd get lucky.

916
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:11,422
7high, do you accept?

917
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:14,091
Gosh, give me a moment. I need to think.

918
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:22,433
I think Eun-yu just
drastically hiked it up.

919
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:25,060
But this doesn't make sense. Hang on.

920
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:27,271
Is there any reason to do that? Okay.

921
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:28,522
7high, you have two minutes left.

922
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:31,525
I don't accept.

923
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:33,736
You have doubted.

924
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:37,197
Starting with Yoon So-hui,
please reveal your cards.

925
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:49,918
Jeong Hyun-gyu.

926
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:58,218
I guess the odds
are not in my favor today.

927
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:00,763
7high.

928
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:12,232
7high, your doubt was successful.

929
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:16,612
-I'm done. I did the best that I could.
-Well played.

930
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:19,323
Son Eun-yu has lost all her Pieces.

931
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:21,116
-See you tomorrow.
-Yeah, good luck.

932
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:26,288
Son Eun-yu becomes the tenth player
eliminated from The Devil's Plan.

933
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:29,500
Son Eun-yu,
please leave this place immediately.

934
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:32,169
If I went to prison,
I'm confident I can make it through.

935
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:34,630
-Well played.
-Queen of prison, right?

936
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:37,675
I want to go to prison. Send me to prison.

937
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:40,344
I'm so sad
that I don't get to play any more games.

938
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:42,638
I think I was really into it every day,

939
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:47,351
to the extent that I didn't
even realize six days had passed.

940
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:50,896
To me, The Devil's Plan was like a mirror.

941
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:54,358
Showing me what kind of person I am
and how I come across…

942
00:44:54,441 --> 00:44:56,819
Why am I crying? Give me a moment.
What's wrong with me?

943
00:44:56,902 --> 00:45:00,072
You won't air this, right?
Are you going to show me crying?

944
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:03,534
What's wrong with me?

945
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:12,626
To me, The Devil's Plan was

946
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:16,755
something that I'd thought
would be a door to a new world,

947
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:18,424
but now that it's over,

948
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:20,926
I think it was a mirror
showing a reflection of me.

949
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:26,223
It was a mirror that clearly
and plainly showed who I am.

950
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:28,892
It was really tough spending
the whole time in prison,

951
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:30,310
but I never gave up,

952
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:34,273
and I think that's what will
live longest in my memory.

953
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:37,526
Good luck. Goodbye.

954
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:38,736
I had so much fun.

955
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:43,866
We played together for so long
that she really felt like a teammate.

956
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:45,743
So, I got a bit emotional,

957
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:49,204
and I felt really sad and disappointed,
to be honest.

958
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:50,998
Round 20 will now begin.

959
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:52,541
Here are your cards.

960
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:55,002
The first player, Yoon So-hui,
please make your prediction.

961
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:55,919
Yes.

962
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:59,715
I think this round is pretty meaningless.

963
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:03,177
If we're apart,
let's share information and play together.

964
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,053
-If we're apart? Okay.
-If we're apart, got it?

965
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:06,013
They have too many.

966
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:08,474
-They're giving back and forth.
-That doesn't matter.

967
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:11,059
If we're split apart,
we will stand a chance.

968
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:13,103
-From that point on, it's a game of skill.
-Okay.

969
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:15,189
Where we all have the same information.

970
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:17,483
-Okay, let's go with seven.
-Green will be better.

971
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:24,114
I will bet one Piece on seven greens.

972
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:25,532
I accept.

973
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:26,700
You have accepted.

974
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:28,202
I will bet on eight greens.

975
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:30,621
Choi Hyun-joon, do you accept?

976
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:32,247
I accept.

977
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:33,624
You have accepted.

978
00:46:33,707 --> 00:46:37,002
I will bet one Piece and increase
the prediction to nine greens.

979
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:38,796
Let's calculate this.

980
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:47,846
-You have one minute left.
-I accept.

981
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:50,390
Jeong Hyun-gyu, you have accepted.
Please make your prediction.

982
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:51,892
I'll go for ten greens.

983
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:53,101
I'll doubt.

984
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:54,269
You have doubted.

985
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:55,854
Please reveal your cards.

986
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:57,981
Yoon So-hui, your doubt was successful.

987
00:46:58,065 --> 00:46:59,399
Here are your Pieces.

988
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:01,568
That concludes Round 20.

989
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:05,072
Please return one Piece each.

990
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:07,032
I was down to my last Piece.

991
00:47:07,115 --> 00:47:09,451
It felt like I was back in prison.

992
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:11,954
To be honest,
I thought I had no chance of winning.

993
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:14,957
You will now draw lots
to determine your new positions.

994
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,291
Okay, I'm number one.

995
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:22,172
Great.

996
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:24,800
Round 21 will now begin.

997
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:26,844
-Can I get a Piece?
-Okay.

998
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:28,387
What the heck? You're taking a Piece?

999
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:31,306
-Yes, I'm going to take a Piece.
-Damn it. He's taking one.

1000
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:32,683
I will bet on there being one red.

1001
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:34,017
I'll doubt.

1002
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:36,270
Yoon So-hui, your doubt has failed.

1003
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:38,063
The Pieces go to Jeong Hyun-gyu.

1004
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:39,022
Okay.

1005
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:41,358
Round 22 will now begin.

1006
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:44,278
The first player, Yoon So-hui,
please make your prediction.

1007
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:45,362
Okay.

1008
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:51,243
-You use this.
-Huh?

1009
00:47:52,494 --> 00:47:53,662
What are they doing?

1010
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:00,711
Do you have a plan?

1011
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:02,212
What do you want?

1012
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,010
This is crazy.

1013
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:10,846
You? Is that what you have?

1014
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:17,019
Give it a go.

1015
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:19,438
-Purple and two rainbows.
-Okay, got it.

1016
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:30,949
-Shall we go for this? In purple?
-Yes.

1017
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:34,870
I will go for seven purples.

1018
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:35,954
I accept.

1019
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:39,666
Choi Hyun-joon, you have accepted.
Please make your prediction.

1020
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:43,253
I will bet on eight purples.

1021
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:46,006
7high, do you accept?

1022
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:48,133
So now it's one against three.

1023
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:51,887
Fine.

1024
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:54,681
They want to get rid of me.

1025
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:58,352
What would they do
to try to get rid of me?

1026
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:05,817
Goodness.

1027
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:08,153
Okay.

1028
00:49:08,236 --> 00:49:09,237
I will accept.

1029
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:11,156
-You're accepting?
-You have accepted.

1030
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:12,574
I thought he might.

1031
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:14,242
7high, please make your prediction.

1032
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:16,161
I will go with nine purples.

1033
00:49:16,244 --> 00:49:18,080
-Jeong Hyun-gyu.
-Yes, I'll doubt.

1034
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:20,499
You have doubted and bet one Piece.

1035
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:24,544
Starting from Choi Hyun-joon,
please reveal your cards.

1036
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:33,845
Yoon So-hui, please reveal your cards.

1037
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:42,479
Jeong Hyun-gyu, please reveal your cards.

1038
00:49:44,272 --> 00:49:45,524
7high.

1039
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:50,654
-Bring it to me!
-What a shame.

1040
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:51,697
Wow, for real?

1041
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:54,199
-Jeong Hyun-gyu, your doubt has failed.
-Seriously?

1042
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:55,784
He's indeed good.

1043
00:49:58,453 --> 00:49:59,621
Okay.

1044
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:01,581
I'm used to long, drawn out battles

1045
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:04,334
so I think I'll definitely get
some chances as we play.

1046
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:05,544
Here are your cards.

1047
00:50:16,221 --> 00:50:17,222
That'll be better.

1048
00:50:17,305 --> 00:50:19,433
Yes, I think that's better too.

1049
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:22,853
Hyun-joon.

1050
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:26,648
I'm sorry.

1051
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:33,613
The first player, Jeong Hyun-gyu,

1052
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:35,657
please make your prediction
and place your bet.

1053
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:46,835
What is it?

1054
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:48,128
-What?
-What's the reason?

1055
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:49,421
You have too few Pieces.

1056
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:51,923
We thought hard about it.

1057
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:54,551
Whether to make
7high with many Pieces finish third

1058
00:50:54,634 --> 00:50:55,844
or Hyun-joon.

1059
00:50:56,845 --> 00:51:00,891
When So-hui and I thought about who'd be
the easier opponent in the prison match,

1060
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:03,351
we felt more confident
going up against 7high

1061
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:06,104
as long as it wasn't betting games,
which we've played twice already.

1062
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:10,400
-I'll go with one red for now.
-Okay.

1063
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:13,028
Jeong Hyun-gyu, you have two minutes left.

1064
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:16,364
I will bet one chip on one red card.

1065
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:19,785
You have bet one Piece on one red card.

1066
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:21,578
Yoon So-hui, do you accept?

1067
00:51:21,661 --> 00:51:22,704
Yes, I accept.

1068
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:25,290
You have accepted.
Please make your prediction.

1069
00:51:25,373 --> 00:51:30,170
I will bet one Piece on six purples.

1070
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:33,215
You have bet one Piece
on six purple cards.

1071
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:34,132
Yes.

1072
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:36,134
Choi Hyun-joon, do you accept?

1073
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:38,345
7high.

1074
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:05,956
I accept.

1075
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:09,334
Choi Hyun-joon, you have accepted.
Please make your prediction.

1076
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,295
I will bet one Piece on seven purples.

1077
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:15,590
You have bet one slot chip
on seven purple cards.

1078
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:17,926
7high, do you accept?

1079
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:22,556
I'll call.

1080
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:24,599
-Would you like to doubt?
-I'll doubt.

1081
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:28,061
You have doubted. You have bet one Piece.

1082
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:30,188
-Have you doubted?
-Yes, I have.

1083
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:31,690
-Me?
-Yes.

1084
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:35,068
-Yoon So-hui, please reveal your cards.
-What is it? Okay.

1085
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:42,784
Jeong Hyun-gyu, please reveal your cards.

1086
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:48,123
7high, please reveal your cards.

1087
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:53,795
-Hang on.
-Choi Hyun-joon.

1088
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:03,471
7high, your doubt has failed.

1089
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:04,431
Nice.

1090
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:08,560
-What?
-Never mind.

1091
00:53:08,643 --> 00:53:12,606
They showed me what their cards were,

1092
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:15,066
suggesting we get rid of Hyun-joon,

1093
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:17,235
and I just had to accept it.

1094
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:19,821
But from my point of view,
Hyun-joon had done nothing wrong.

1095
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:24,576
So, I gave Hyun-joon a Piece, implying
they shouldn't try to control me, but…

1096
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:32,918
Please return your cards.

1097
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:34,419
You really won't play with me?

1098
00:53:34,502 --> 00:53:35,587
I'll play as you say.

1099
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:44,262
If you can, let me join you.
I can risk more if you tell me to.

1100
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:47,682
Will you? Let's do it together.

1101
00:53:49,851 --> 00:53:51,645
Let's do it 'cause I can do it.

1102
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:52,854
Okay.

1103
00:53:58,777 --> 00:53:59,778
I don't know.

1104
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:07,077
I think his desire to win
is really strong.

1105
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:11,248
It seems Hyun-joon is trying to survive
by any means necessary.

1106
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:14,334
So if that's what he chose to do
to survive, I respect it.

1107
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:16,503
I won't think any further than that.

1108
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:20,507
On a personal level,
I do feel bad about what I did to 7high,

1109
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:23,635
but this is The Devil's Plan,
and we're here to win.

1110
00:54:23,718 --> 00:54:26,137
We're here to survive,
not to give up and die.

1111
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:30,225
And I think I've gone through a lot more
than the others to get this far.

1112
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:34,479
I was so desperate,
so all I was thinking was,

1113
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:38,566
"I'll say anything to change the dynamics.
I can't go home."

1114
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:40,652
Round 24 will now begin.

1115
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:42,654
Well, I was just being practical.

1116
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:45,865
Even if it takes a long time,
we've agreed to play with Hyun-joon,

1117
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:47,909
so now we go back to the endless cycle.

1118
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:49,828
I will go for five blues.

1119
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:50,996
I accept.

1120
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:52,330
You have accepted.

1121
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:54,249
I will go for seven blues.

1122
00:54:54,332 --> 00:54:56,293
-I accept.
-You have accepted.

1123
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:01,715
That concludes Round 25.

1124
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:05,093
Please return one Piece each.

1125
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:08,013
-I will go for eight purples.
-I accept.

1126
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:10,557
Nine greens.

1127
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,684
-I accept.
-You have accepted.

1128
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:18,481
I'll bet one Piece on ten blues.

1129
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:19,649
I'll doubt.

1130
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:21,484
Choi Hyun-joon, your doubt was successful.

1131
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:24,112
-I'll go for 20 purples.
-I'll doubt.

1132
00:55:24,195 --> 00:55:25,405
I'll go for 20 reds.

1133
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:27,532
-I'll doubt.
-You have doubted.

1134
00:55:27,615 --> 00:55:30,076
That concludes Round 30.

1135
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,537
That concludes Round 35.

1136
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:36,041
Please return one Piece each.

1137
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:37,334
It's the worst.

1138
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:39,294
Every five rounds we each lose a Piece.

1139
00:55:39,377 --> 00:55:42,380
And it seems like
their strategy is just to kill time

1140
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:45,675
until I run out of Pieces and go home.

1141
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:48,470
The spirit of this game really is
The Devil's Plan.

1142
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:50,889
I think the devil will be
coming for me soon.

1143
00:55:50,972 --> 00:55:54,017
You're so good, so I just want
to make sure you have zero chance.

1144
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:56,394
Round 36 will now begin.

1145
00:55:56,478 --> 00:55:58,646
Yoon So-hui, your doubt has failed.

1146
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:00,523
Round 37 will now begin.

1147
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:02,275
Jeong Hyun-gyu, your doubt has failed.

1148
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:04,110
Round 38 will now begin.

1149
00:56:04,652 --> 00:56:05,862
I will go for eight blues.

1150
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:07,906
Eight blues.

1151
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:10,283
There's no need. Just assume he has five.

1152
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:11,409
I accept.

1153
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:12,452
You have accepted.

1154
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:15,080
There's nothing I can do.

1155
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:18,208
-What the heck?
-Tell me about it.

1156
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:21,628
There's nothing I can do.
I really had five.

1157
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:23,713
Jeong Hyun-gyu, your doubt was successful.

1158
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:24,923
Thank you.

1159
00:56:25,006 --> 00:56:27,092
Round 39 will now begin.

1160
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:30,387
I will bet one Piece on one yellow.

1161
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:32,555
You have bet one Piece on one yellow card.

1162
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:33,765
I'll doubt.

1163
00:56:33,848 --> 00:56:36,101
Jeong Hyun-gyu, your doubt has failed.

1164
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:40,188
Can I ask something?
Just out of curiosity.

1165
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:41,231
Sure.

1166
00:56:41,314 --> 00:56:42,649
Are you going to win?

1167
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:46,861
No, if one of the two makes it
to the final, we'll see then.

1168
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:49,906
No, I mean, is your strategy here
to finish first, second and third?

1169
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:51,116
Yes.

1170
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:52,700
How did you come to decide it like that?

1171
00:56:54,953 --> 00:56:56,663
Why are you always first?

1172
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:02,502
I'm just asking.
I'm not saying that it's bad.

1173
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:05,505
I'm just curious
on what basis you have decided

1174
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:06,589
who gets to be first.

1175
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:08,007
So-hui, is there a reason?

1176
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:11,594
Well, he gave me
some Pieces yesterday, so…

1177
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:14,556
-There's no specific reason.
-Okay.

1178
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:19,727
That concludes Round 40.

1179
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:23,481
Please return one Piece each.

1180
00:57:24,732 --> 00:57:26,651
So-hui, I should give you some Pieces.

1181
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:29,654
You will now draw lots
to determine your new positions.

1182
00:57:31,573 --> 00:57:32,574
I'm number two again.

1183
00:57:32,657 --> 00:57:34,784
It seems
the goddess of chance is drunk today.

1184
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:36,786
The two of us just need to switch seats.

1185
00:57:37,495 --> 00:57:39,330
Jeez.

1186
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:42,834
I think I should quit with
the calculations. The odds are all lies.

1187
00:57:45,378 --> 00:57:47,547
Round 41 will now begin.

1188
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:50,717
If you doubt me and raise,
then I can fold.

1189
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,343
When it's my turn, right?

1190
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:54,179
We don't even need
to look at the cards anymore.

1191
00:57:54,262 --> 00:57:58,516
-Eun-yu, Ji-yeong, I miss you!
-I miss Ji-yeong.

1192
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,310
I miss you.

1193
00:58:00,393 --> 00:58:03,605
Eun-yu, Ji-yeong, I miss you.

1194
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:05,773
Yoon So-hui, please make your prediction.

1195
00:58:05,857 --> 00:58:07,150
One red.

1196
00:58:07,233 --> 00:58:08,693
I'll accept. I'll just accept.

1197
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:11,112
-So quick to accept.
-I accepted.

1198
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:12,405
-I'm always quick to accept.
-Sure.

1199
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:13,948
You bet one Piece on one red.

1200
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:16,242
-There's nothing I can do.
-7high, you have accepted.

1201
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:19,120
-7high, please make your prediction.
-I will go for two yellows.

1202
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:21,164
I think you're probably right.

1203
00:58:21,247 --> 00:58:22,832
-I accept. Yes.
-You have accepted.

1204
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:24,501
Choi Hyun-joon,
please make your prediction.

1205
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:28,087
-I will bet on three yellows.
-Three.

1206
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:31,841
-I will bet two Pieces on four yellows.
-You bet two Pieces on four yellow cards.

1207
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:33,593
-I'll doubt.
-Would you like to doubt?

1208
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:35,011
-Yes.
-I'll fold.

1209
00:58:35,094 --> 00:58:37,013
Jeong Hyun-gyu, you have folded.

1210
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:40,099
Let me collect the cards now.

1211
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:41,518
Hyun-gyu's lost.

1212
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:43,895
Would you like some more?

1213
00:58:45,271 --> 00:58:47,357
Round 42 will now begin.

1214
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,192
Jeong Hyun-gyu,
please make your prediction.

1215
00:58:49,275 --> 00:58:51,569
I will bet one Piece on one red.

1216
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:53,154
You have bet one Piece on one red card.

1217
00:58:53,238 --> 00:58:54,989
Let's go all the way around
to give him a Piece.

1218
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:58,076
I will bet one Piece on two reds.

1219
00:58:58,159 --> 00:59:00,286
You have bet one Piece on two red cards.

1220
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:01,829
7high, do you accept?

1221
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:10,880
I'll doubt.

1222
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:15,677
I'll call one

1223
00:59:16,302 --> 00:59:17,762
and raise four.

1224
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:22,976
-All-in?
-All-in.

1225
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:28,606
Okay, see here. Let's do the math.

1226
00:59:29,315 --> 00:59:30,900
How many does he have?

1227
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:33,444
If you get all those,
will you have more than me?

1228
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:35,488
If you get all those,
you'll have more than me.

1229
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:40,034
I think he wants you to finish first
and us two to go to prison.

1230
00:59:43,162 --> 00:59:45,540
With our positions like this,
I think you're right.

1231
00:59:49,794 --> 00:59:51,546
So-hui, come over here for a moment.

1232
00:59:56,342 --> 00:59:58,136
You finish first and go to the living area

1233
00:59:58,219 --> 01:00:00,221
while these two go to prison
and fight for the final.

1234
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:01,764
That's the last thing I can do.

1235
01:00:01,848 --> 01:00:03,933
Just let me do something. And you win.

1236
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:07,979
I should get to play the game properly.

1237
01:00:08,062 --> 01:00:09,105
That's true.

1238
01:00:09,188 --> 01:00:10,815
This is what I want.

1239
01:00:10,898 --> 01:00:14,027
I finally realized,
"I can't turn things around here."

1240
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:17,572
Of course, Hyun-gyu might claim
that he found some way

1241
01:00:17,655 --> 01:00:23,369
of winning regardless,
a surefire way of winning this game,

1242
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:27,707
but in truth, I'm not someone
who wants to praise him for that.

1243
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:30,460
Also, Hyun-gyu had been
carefully managing his Pieces,

1244
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:33,087
there was a gap of six, so I was waiting.

1245
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:34,380
You raise, and I'll fold.

1246
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:37,342
-I'll fold.
-Jeong Hyun-gyu, you have folded.

1247
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:39,552
The moment he gave it to her, I realized,

1248
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:42,847
"If I give her my Pieces right now,
I can upset the applecart."

1249
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:44,307
And I made my move right away.

1250
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:46,726
If you let him finish first like he wants…

1251
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:47,977
What do you think they're talking about?

1252
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:52,273
I don't know. I think he might be
saying something like, "You finish first."

1253
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:53,733
What a twist!

1254
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:57,195
I don't have any options.

1255
01:00:57,278 --> 01:00:59,197
All I can do before I leave

1256
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,407
is chuck everything out there
so you finish first,

1257
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:04,494
and let Hyun-gyu suffer a bit
down there in prison.

1258
01:01:04,577 --> 01:01:08,039
That's why I'm doing this.
Do you get what I'm saying?

1259
01:01:08,122 --> 01:01:11,042
Yes. Can I have a moment
to think about it? Just a moment.

1260
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:14,045
Take it. I'm putting my life
on the line for you.

1261
01:01:14,128 --> 01:01:16,589
It's the last thing I can do.
Please take it.

1262
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:20,093
-Think it over.
-I just need a moment to think about it…

1263
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:32,647
I don't want to call on him.

1264
01:01:38,611 --> 01:01:41,072
-So-hui. What's wrong?
-Yes.

1265
01:01:44,617 --> 01:01:45,618
What's wrong?

1266
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:48,287
I mean,

1267
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:51,374
I want to win as much as the next person.

1268
01:01:51,457 --> 01:01:54,168
But I don't want to toss aside
what I've been doing with Hyun-gyu

1269
01:01:54,252 --> 01:01:56,337
because of that.

1270
01:01:58,297 --> 01:02:00,383
Because of what 7high proposed,

1271
01:02:00,466 --> 01:02:04,095
I might look like someone
who doesn't want to win

1272
01:02:04,178 --> 01:02:06,723
even though I have the chance to win.

1273
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:08,808
I have the chance not to go to prison,

1274
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:13,104
but I may be portrayed as a total fool
who would give up on that chance.

1275
01:02:13,771 --> 01:02:15,648
From 7high's perspective,

1276
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:18,735
this is the only thing he can do
to switch up the dynamics.

1277
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:22,613
It must have been so hard for him.
I would hate myself for denying him that.

1278
01:02:22,697 --> 01:02:25,324
So there are a thousand things
going through my mind right now.

1279
01:02:26,951 --> 01:02:27,952
Send me.

1280
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:32,623
It's okay to send me off.
This isn't betraying me.

1281
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:35,376
What about you?

1282
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:37,086
I'm fine.

1283
01:02:38,045 --> 01:02:40,089
You're just doing your best.

1284
01:02:49,348 --> 01:02:52,560
So-hui, just do
what you were planning to do.

1285
01:02:57,565 --> 01:02:59,901
I just wanted to switch things up.

1286
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:04,989
You can either make a bet or fold.

1287
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:10,703
-I'll call.
-Please bet five more.

1288
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:13,998
Congratulations, So-hui.

1289
01:03:14,081 --> 01:03:15,458
Everyone, enjoy the rest of the game.

1290
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:16,626
Well played, everyone.

1291
01:03:16,709 --> 01:03:17,710
I did my best.

1292
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:19,003
-I know.
-Choi Hyun-joon.

1293
01:03:19,086 --> 01:03:22,590
You get it, right? I just wanted
to mix things up a bit before I left.

1294
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:25,551
Good luck.

1295
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:27,428
Well played. See you tomorrow.

1296
01:03:28,387 --> 01:03:29,430
I'm going to miss you.

1297
01:03:29,514 --> 01:03:31,557
-7high.
-No hard feelings, you know that, right?

1298
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:34,560
-I just wanted to break things up.
-You have to play as hard as you can.

1299
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:35,770
-I'm sorry.
-Well played.

1300
01:03:35,853 --> 01:03:38,564
So-hui. It's okay. Well played. Okay?

1301
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:40,566
In the final, make sure
you play for yourself.

1302
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:41,734
Just for yourself, okay?

1303
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:45,071
7high has lost all his Pieces.

1304
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:51,577
7high becomes the eleventh player
eliminated from The Devil's Plan.

1305
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:53,830
It's really…

1306
01:03:54,705 --> 01:03:55,706
such a shame.

1307
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:58,584
What should I put?

1308
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:03,005
I think it was a week where I endured
the most emotional changes in my life,

1309
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:06,342
racked my brain so much,

1310
01:04:06,425 --> 01:04:09,303
and spent a lot of time worrying.

1311
01:04:09,387 --> 01:04:10,847
I have a lot of regrets.

1312
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:15,434
Well, not being able to control
my feelings and getting angry.

1313
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:19,438
My voice is loud enough as it is,
but I was getting louder still.

1314
01:04:20,898 --> 01:04:24,402
Still, I like to think
I play with my own beliefs and standards.

1315
01:04:24,485 --> 01:04:27,572
So I hope that when I play games,

1316
01:04:27,655 --> 01:04:30,116
people remember me as a gamer

1317
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:33,744
who plays games
with that kind of mind-set.

1318
01:04:33,828 --> 01:04:37,832
I'll remember Ji-yeong and Eun-yu a lot.

1319
01:04:37,915 --> 01:04:42,378
I toughed it out in prison bolstered by
the thought that one of us in the alliance

1320
01:04:42,461 --> 01:04:45,965
would end up sitting
on the victory throne.

1321
01:04:46,048 --> 01:04:48,885
Even though I wasn't good enough
to make that happen,

1322
01:04:48,968 --> 01:04:51,137
I hope they'll forgive me
when they see this.

1323
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:54,640
And I'm sorry and also grateful.

1324
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:58,311
7high, please
leave this place immediately.

1325
01:04:58,394 --> 01:04:59,937
Well played.

1326
01:05:00,021 --> 01:05:02,732
-Good luck. See you tomorrow.
-See you soon.

1327
01:05:02,815 --> 01:05:04,650
-Good luck.
-Bye.

1328
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:09,614
With two players having been eliminated,
there are three remaining players.

1329
01:05:09,697 --> 01:05:11,657
This concludes Doubt and Bet.

1330
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:12,909
Done.

1331
01:05:13,701 --> 01:05:17,204
Players' slots will now
be exchanged to Pieces.

1332
01:05:18,372 --> 01:05:19,415
Oh, my.

1333
01:05:19,498 --> 01:05:21,667
The player with the most Pieces,
Yoon So-hui,

1334
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:23,753
qualifies for the final match.

1335
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:28,841
Jeong Hyun-gyu and Choi Hyun-joon,

1336
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:31,052
it has been decided
that you will be in the prison block.

1337
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:32,303
So, I'm going back again.

1338
01:05:32,386 --> 01:05:34,347
Come back tomorrow. Promise me.

1339
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:38,434
All players, please make your way
to your assigned accommodations.

1340
01:05:38,517 --> 01:05:40,144
-We're going to have fun.
-Okay.

1341
01:05:40,227 --> 01:05:41,771
-It'll be fun, right?
-Yes, for me.

1342
01:05:41,854 --> 01:05:43,522
-It's one on one.
-It's going to be fun.

1343
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:45,441
-I can't wait.
-Exactly.

1344
01:05:45,524 --> 01:05:47,109
I don't have any personal effects.

1345
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:49,195
-Please check in your pockets.
-My pockets are empty.

1346
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:50,613
Then we will make our way.

1347
01:05:50,696 --> 01:05:52,573
-Good luck.
-Don't cry. Keep your promise.

1348
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:53,616
Bye.

1349
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:04,043
I'm back again.

1350
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:05,127
It's a cobweb.

1351
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:09,423
This isn't so bad.

1352
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:13,678
Well, you can't really call this
a prison, it's more like a field hospital.

1353
01:06:13,761 --> 01:06:18,432
I thought it would be oppressive
and basic, but it has beds.

1354
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:20,476
In fact, it has everything you might need.

1355
01:06:21,143 --> 01:06:25,064
Wow, Ha-rin really loved this.
A Knight's Tour.

1356
01:06:25,147 --> 01:06:26,524
-Ha-rin?
-Yes.

1357
01:06:26,607 --> 01:06:29,443
It's nice being back here after so long.

1358
01:06:29,527 --> 01:06:31,320
Right, now I remember this feeling.

1359
01:06:32,613 --> 01:06:35,366
These beds were all occupied.
By seven people.

1360
01:06:39,036 --> 01:06:41,497
The prison was quite special to me.

1361
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:43,791
It was a special place that gave me

1362
01:06:43,874 --> 01:06:49,005
the bitter taste of defeat
as well as the sweet taste of victory.

1363
01:06:49,088 --> 01:06:52,425
Since there were just the two of us
at the end, I was thinking,

1364
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:54,427
"One of us is crashing out here,

1365
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:58,347
so whether I take another step forward
or go home,

1366
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:00,474
let's make sure I'll have no regrets."

1367
01:07:00,558 --> 01:07:01,684
Do your best.

1368
01:07:01,767 --> 01:07:03,436
-Of course.
-That's the coolest thing to do.

1369
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:05,563
-I really want to make it to the final.
-Exactly.

1370
01:07:05,646 --> 01:07:06,939
Isn't that better?

1371
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:10,317
It's just a straight fight
regardless of the number of our Pieces.

1372
01:07:10,401 --> 01:07:12,695
So we can put it all on the line
and have a fair fight.

1373
01:07:12,778 --> 01:07:15,990
For this game, rather than thinking,
"I will win no matter what,"

1374
01:07:16,073 --> 01:07:17,825
I thought, "Just trust myself

1375
01:07:17,908 --> 01:07:19,785
and have a good go."

1376
01:07:49,523 --> 01:07:53,027
I wasn't feeling well
the whole time I was playing.

1377
01:07:53,110 --> 01:07:57,573
I just thought I had an upset stomach,
but it was hurting so much,

1378
01:07:57,656 --> 01:08:02,828
and it turned out I had stomach cramps,
and the pain isn't really going away.

1379
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:11,128
I've thought about
what the last game might be.

1380
01:08:11,212 --> 01:08:15,132
We've played cards,
we've done an auction, we've done betting.

1381
01:08:15,216 --> 01:08:17,343
We did a territorial game. Was it Wall Go?

1382
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:20,054
That was Wall Go,
so we've played a Go-like game.

1383
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:22,681
So what could it be?

1384
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:28,646
The prison match will begin in 30 minutes.

1385
01:08:28,729 --> 01:08:31,565
The winner of tonight's prison match

1386
01:08:31,649 --> 01:08:33,943
will not only qualify for the final

1387
01:08:34,026 --> 01:08:36,695
but also get to stay in the living area.

1388
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:37,947
That's great news.

1389
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:41,325
The defeated player will be
eliminated from The Devil's Plan.

1390
01:08:41,408 --> 01:08:42,993
If you end up going,
be sure to comfort So-hui.

1391
01:08:43,077 --> 01:08:45,955
Here is the sixth prison match

1392
01:08:46,038 --> 01:08:49,458
which will decide the final player
to be eliminated.

1393
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:50,918
Today's prison match is

1394
01:08:51,001 --> 01:08:52,753
Equation Pyramid.

1395
01:08:52,837 --> 01:08:55,214
Equation Pyramid is a game
that requires players to select

1396
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:58,676
three squares from the board
and combine the numbers in them

1397
01:08:58,759 --> 01:09:01,220
in an equation that will derive
a target number.

1398
01:09:01,303 --> 01:09:03,931
The game will take place over ten rounds.

1399
01:09:04,014 --> 01:09:08,811
When the game starts,
players will have been provided buzzers.

1400
01:09:08,894 --> 01:09:10,354
At the beginning of each round,

1401
01:09:10,437 --> 01:09:14,525
a pyramid-shaped board
and a target number will be revealed.

1402
01:09:14,608 --> 01:09:17,945
The game board consists of ten squares,

1403
01:09:18,028 --> 01:09:22,908
each containing one
of the four arithmetic operators

1404
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:27,204
of plus, minus, multiply and divide,
along with a number.

1405
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:29,081
When the board is revealed,

1406
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:33,294
each player shall choose three squares
and use them to make an equation

1407
01:09:33,377 --> 01:09:34,920
which comes out at the target number.

1408
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:38,924
Each square can only be used once,

1409
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:43,888
and the operator on the first square
in your equation will be disregarded.

1410
01:09:44,388 --> 01:09:46,765
The completed equation shall be calculated

1411
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:48,809
in accordance
with the order of operations.

1412
01:09:48,893 --> 01:09:51,520
For example, if the target number is nine,

1413
01:09:51,604 --> 01:09:54,815
the following combinations
are correct answers.

1414
01:09:54,899 --> 01:09:57,276
C, A, F.

1415
01:09:57,359 --> 01:09:59,278
D, E, H.

1416
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:01,989
F, A, C.

1417
01:10:02,072 --> 01:10:04,033
G, D, E.

1418
01:10:04,116 --> 01:10:06,368
These four combinations.

1419
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:09,705
Any player identifying a correct answer
shall press their buzzer

1420
01:10:09,788 --> 01:10:13,375
and give their answer within ten seconds.

1421
01:10:13,459 --> 01:10:16,420
If their answer is correct,
they are awarded one point.

1422
01:10:17,004 --> 01:10:20,549
If their answer is wrong,
they have one point deducted.

1423
01:10:20,633 --> 01:10:22,218
Hyun-gyu will be good at this.

1424
01:10:22,301 --> 01:10:25,054
Providing an answer
that has already been given

1425
01:10:25,137 --> 01:10:29,141
or failing to answer
within the allotted time

1426
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:31,518
shall also result
in a one-point deduction.

1427
01:10:31,602 --> 01:10:32,478
What a well-made game.

1428
01:10:32,561 --> 01:10:35,147
Once the round begins,
it shall last for three minutes

1429
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:40,277
or until both players have found
all possible correct answers.

1430
01:10:40,361 --> 01:10:42,446
Once ten rounds have been played,

1431
01:10:42,529 --> 01:10:45,199
the player with the lower points
shall be eliminated,

1432
01:10:45,282 --> 01:10:48,953
while the player with the higher points
shall move to the living area.

1433
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:53,666
The game will start in 30 minutes.

1434
01:10:53,749 --> 01:10:56,377
-Oh, my God.
-I suck at math.

1435
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:57,628
I'm no good either.

1436
01:10:57,711 --> 01:10:58,921
You're a math major.

1437
01:10:59,004 --> 01:11:01,298
I do, but I'm not good at calculations.
I only do proofs.

1438
01:11:01,382 --> 01:11:02,675
I'm screwed.

1439
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:05,135
Damn, I should have studied
harder as a kid.

1440
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:07,888
When I saw it, I thought
the most important thing

1441
01:11:07,972 --> 01:11:10,015
was the division card.

1442
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:12,059
This is an array of integers,

1443
01:11:12,142 --> 01:11:15,104
so for example, if there is
something like a divide by seven,

1444
01:11:15,187 --> 01:11:17,064
all numbers except seven, for example,

1445
01:11:17,147 --> 01:11:19,775
all numbers that are not divisible
by seven can't really be used.

1446
01:11:19,858 --> 01:11:23,028
So I realized, "We have to use seven
first, so there will be no division,"

1447
01:11:23,112 --> 01:11:25,197
and I thought that was a good thing
to know and use.

1448
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:27,491
You know, it's been about three minutes.

1449
01:11:27,574 --> 01:11:29,493
-I've found one.
-Same.

1450
01:11:29,576 --> 01:11:30,911
This is the easiest one, right?

1451
01:11:30,995 --> 01:11:32,496
-Isn't it that one?
-D, E… D, E, H.

1452
01:11:32,997 --> 01:11:34,707
I've got F, A, C.

1453
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:36,959
C, A, F and F, A, C are both correct.

1454
01:11:37,543 --> 01:11:39,461
-But they're different.
-Exactly.

1455
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:41,005
The order is important.

1456
01:11:41,505 --> 01:11:43,132
G, D, E is also on the answer sheet.

1457
01:11:43,632 --> 01:11:44,633
How does that work?

1458
01:11:44,717 --> 01:11:47,720
Eleven minus…

1459
01:11:47,803 --> 01:11:50,222
Wow, 11 minus two? Wow, damn.

1460
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:52,057
It's 10 permute 3.

1461
01:11:52,808 --> 01:11:55,769
Then if it's ten, nine, eight,
that makes 720 combinations.

1462
01:11:56,645 --> 01:11:59,189
It's so complicated because
it includes the four basic operations.

1463
01:11:59,273 --> 01:12:01,066
After seeing it,
I really thought I was screwed.

1464
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:05,070
"Moreover, he's a math major at KAIST,
so how am I going to beat him?"

1465
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:07,406
Honestly though, mathematicians
aren't very good at calculating.

1466
01:12:07,489 --> 01:12:10,367
I always do proofs to prove
the possibility of something,

1467
01:12:10,451 --> 01:12:11,785
but I don't know the answer itself.

1468
01:12:11,869 --> 01:12:13,954
Are you bluffing right now?

1469
01:12:16,707 --> 01:12:19,376
The prison match will begin shortly.

1470
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:24,381
All players in the prison,
please make your way to the death room.

1471
01:12:24,465 --> 01:12:27,176
Originally,
I could have ended up there myself.

1472
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:30,220
I just felt really uncomfortable.

1473
01:12:32,264 --> 01:12:33,265
Let's go.

1474
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:35,934
-Let's have some fun.
-Sure.

1475
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:37,311
I know you're bluffing.

1476
01:12:37,394 --> 01:12:38,645
I'm really not.

1477
01:12:49,615 --> 01:12:50,991
-Hello, So-hui!
-Stand where you'd like.

1478
01:12:51,075 --> 01:12:53,077
So-hui, don't cry.
I'm going to smash this.

1479
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:54,661
One of us will be joining you.

1480
01:12:54,745 --> 01:12:55,746
Good luck.

1481
01:12:56,288 --> 01:12:58,207
But really, I'm in big trouble.

1482
01:12:58,290 --> 01:13:00,667
Because there were so many mirrors,
it was so tough.

1483
01:13:00,751 --> 01:13:03,087
The psychological pressure
in the death room was immense.

1484
01:13:03,170 --> 01:13:04,254
What do I do?

1485
01:13:07,466 --> 01:13:11,470
After going through all that hardship
and surviving that far, I was thinking,

1486
01:13:11,553 --> 01:13:14,098
"Let's shake it all off
and play without regrets."

1487
01:13:14,181 --> 01:13:16,308
The sixth prison match,

1488
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:19,520
Equation Pyramid, will now begin.

1489
01:13:19,603 --> 01:13:20,479
Let's try our best.

1490
01:13:20,562 --> 01:13:21,688
Cool.

1491
01:13:21,772 --> 01:13:23,690
Here is the board for Round 1.

1492
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:33,158
Here is the target number.

1493
01:13:54,179 --> 01:13:55,973
-Jeong Hyun-gyu.
-J, B, D.

1494
01:13:56,056 --> 01:13:58,225
-J, B, D.
-B, D.

1495
01:13:58,308 --> 01:14:00,227
That is incorrect. You lose one point.

1496
01:14:04,064 --> 01:14:05,941
-Jeong Hyun-gyu.
-B, J, D.

1497
01:14:06,525 --> 01:14:09,319
That is correct.
You have acquired one point.

1498
01:14:09,403 --> 01:14:10,779
I can't believe it.

1499
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:11,864
The order.

1500
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:18,954
Jeong Hyun-gyu.

1501
01:14:19,037 --> 01:14:20,789
J, H, C.

1502
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:23,208
That is correct.
You have acquired one point.

1503
01:14:27,963 --> 01:14:29,715
-Choi Hyun-joon.
-I, G, C.

1504
01:14:29,798 --> 01:14:31,550
I, G, C.

1505
01:14:31,633 --> 01:14:34,303
That is correct.
You have acquired one point.

1506
01:14:40,851 --> 01:14:41,977
Jeong Hyun-gyu.

1507
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:43,353
A,

1508
01:14:43,437 --> 01:14:45,314
C, H.

1509
01:14:45,397 --> 01:14:46,940
A, C, H, that's correct.

1510
01:14:47,024 --> 01:14:49,401
That is correct.
You have acquired one point.

1511
01:14:49,902 --> 01:14:51,570
I can also see D, B, C.

1512
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:53,322
Choi Hyun-joon.

1513
01:14:53,405 --> 01:14:54,907
D, B, C.

1514
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:57,743
That is correct.
You have acquired one point.

1515
01:14:58,494 --> 01:15:00,579
I didn't care about Hyun-joon.

1516
01:15:00,662 --> 01:15:03,832
This was about
how much I believed in myself,

1517
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:05,584
so I was determined not to react

1518
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:09,630
to Hyun-joon pressing the buzzer
or getting one right.

1519
01:15:27,564 --> 01:15:28,899
You have ten seconds left.

1520
01:15:37,032 --> 01:15:38,659
That concludes Round 1.

1521
01:15:39,493 --> 01:15:40,869
Here are the scores.

1522
01:15:46,667 --> 01:15:47,751
This is fun.

1523
01:15:50,504 --> 01:15:53,090
Here is the board for Round 2.

1524
01:15:56,510 --> 01:15:58,512
Here is the target number.

1525
01:16:09,731 --> 01:16:11,066
Jeong Hyun-gyu.

1526
01:16:11,149 --> 01:16:12,276
G, D, C.

1527
01:16:12,901 --> 01:16:15,487
That is correct.
You have acquired one point.

1528
01:16:23,495 --> 01:16:24,496
Choi Hyun-joon.

1529
01:16:26,081 --> 01:16:27,165
F, G, I.

1530
01:16:28,792 --> 01:16:30,002
That is correct.

1531
01:16:30,085 --> 01:16:31,837
All correct answers have now been found.

1532
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:33,255
That concludes Round 2.

1533
01:16:33,797 --> 01:16:35,382
You're good.

1534
01:16:35,465 --> 01:16:37,301
Here are the scores.

1535
01:16:38,468 --> 01:16:39,469
You're doing well.

1536
01:16:39,553 --> 01:16:41,805
Here is the board for Round 3.

1537
01:16:42,973 --> 01:16:44,891
Here is the target number.

1538
01:16:47,060 --> 01:16:48,645
The numbers are getting bigger.

1539
01:16:55,235 --> 01:16:56,945
-Choi Hyun-joon.
-J, H, A.

1540
01:16:58,864 --> 01:17:01,992
That is correct.
You have acquired one point.

1541
01:17:02,075 --> 01:17:03,994
Wow, math department, I knew it!

1542
01:17:04,953 --> 01:17:06,997
My basic strategy was to take one number

1543
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:09,249
from the division
and multiplication group,

1544
01:17:09,333 --> 01:17:12,961
and one from the addition and
subtraction groups, and combine them.

1545
01:17:13,045 --> 01:17:14,796
Because if you do successive divisions,

1546
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:17,549
the probability of being divisible
by an integer is too low,

1547
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:19,009
and if you do successive multiplications,

1548
01:17:19,092 --> 01:17:20,802
the absolute value of the number
becomes too large,

1549
01:17:20,886 --> 01:17:21,970
so I didn't think that would work.

1550
01:17:22,054 --> 01:17:24,222
So whenever I was looking
at a multiplication number,

1551
01:17:24,306 --> 01:17:26,808
the next number I would go for
was an addition or a subtraction.

1552
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:32,064
-Jeong Hyun-gyu.
-A, J, D.

1553
01:17:32,689 --> 01:17:35,108
That is correct.
You have acquired one point.

1554
01:17:40,238 --> 01:17:42,074
What else is there?

1555
01:17:45,202 --> 01:17:46,620
You have one minute left.

1556
01:17:51,208 --> 01:17:52,209
Jeong Hyun-gyu.

1557
01:17:52,709 --> 01:17:53,877
E, I, C.

1558
01:17:54,586 --> 01:17:56,505
That is incorrect. You lose one point.

1559
01:17:57,047 --> 01:17:58,298
How is that incorrect?

1560
01:17:59,383 --> 01:18:01,551
Was my calculation… Is my brain shot?

1561
01:18:02,552 --> 01:18:03,553
Right.

1562
01:18:04,554 --> 01:18:05,681
You have ten seconds left.

1563
01:18:07,933 --> 01:18:13,146
This is really draining
because you have to keep searching.

1564
01:18:14,022 --> 01:18:15,691
That concludes Round 3.

1565
01:18:16,858 --> 01:18:18,527
Here are the scores.

1566
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:22,656
This is really difficult.

1567
01:18:23,490 --> 01:18:24,741
This is difficult.

1568
01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:31,456
I was confident when things were
neck and neck in the beginning.

1569
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:33,917
I was learning one round at a time.

1570
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:37,170
Here is the board for Round 4.

1571
01:18:39,756 --> 01:18:41,425
Here is the target number.

1572
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:46,680
Choi Hyun-joon.

1573
01:18:48,181 --> 01:18:49,891
D, I, B.

1574
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:53,562
No, I've made a mistake.

1575
01:18:53,645 --> 01:18:56,106
-That is incorrect.
-Well, I made… Then I'll do it again.

1576
01:18:56,189 --> 01:18:57,315
You lose one point.

1577
01:18:58,024 --> 01:18:59,359
-Choi Hyun-joon.
-Gosh.

1578
01:18:59,443 --> 01:19:01,445
Hyun-joon,
can't you even read the alphabet anymore?

1579
01:19:01,528 --> 01:19:02,946
D, I, A.

1580
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:04,614
That is correct.

1581
01:19:04,698 --> 01:19:06,199
You have acquired one point.

1582
01:19:06,783 --> 01:19:07,909
Cleverly placed.

1583
01:19:08,618 --> 01:19:12,748
Hyun-gyu, do 13 minus 8 divided by 4.

1584
01:19:12,831 --> 01:19:13,915
B, C, J.

1585
01:19:14,958 --> 01:19:16,084
Jeong Hyun-gyu.

1586
01:19:19,629 --> 01:19:21,339
I'll go with B, C, J.

1587
01:19:22,174 --> 01:19:25,051
That is correct.
You have acquired one point.

1588
01:19:25,135 --> 01:19:31,141
As I was playing Rounds 1 to 3…
Shall I call it a tip? I found something.

1589
01:19:31,224 --> 01:19:34,186
For example, you can't make
a prime number with multiplication.

1590
01:19:34,269 --> 01:19:36,271
You have to use plus or minus
no matter what.

1591
01:19:36,354 --> 01:19:38,982
Because of that,
I was trying to do multiplication first.

1592
01:19:39,816 --> 01:19:40,817
Jeong Hyun-gyu.

1593
01:19:40,901 --> 01:19:44,029
J, A, I.

1594
01:19:44,112 --> 01:19:46,782
That is correct.
You have acquired one point.

1595
01:19:52,370 --> 01:19:53,663
You have one minute left.

1596
01:20:03,965 --> 01:20:05,342
You have ten seconds left.

1597
01:20:06,134 --> 01:20:07,552
Wow, this is just…

1598
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:11,681
That concludes Round 4.

1599
01:20:13,642 --> 01:20:15,185
That mistake at the beginning. Damn.

1600
01:20:15,268 --> 01:20:16,937
Here are the scores.

1601
01:20:18,522 --> 01:20:21,817
It was neck and neck,
so every point was so important.

1602
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:23,527
D, I, B.

1603
01:20:23,610 --> 01:20:25,070
No, I've made a mistake.

1604
01:20:25,153 --> 01:20:29,157
But I threw away a point after I made
a mistake by reading the wrong letter.

1605
01:20:29,241 --> 01:20:31,243
Here is the board for Round 5.

1606
01:20:33,912 --> 01:20:35,831
Here is the target number.

1607
01:20:44,422 --> 01:20:45,423
Jeong Hyun-gyu.

1608
01:20:45,507 --> 01:20:47,509
I'll go with B, E, C.

1609
01:20:48,093 --> 01:20:50,595
That is correct.
You have acquired one point.

1610
01:20:51,555 --> 01:20:52,472
Jeong Hyun-gyu.

1611
01:20:55,475 --> 01:20:56,977
I'll go for E, C, F.

1612
01:20:57,060 --> 01:20:59,604
That is correct.
You have acquired one point.

1613
01:20:59,688 --> 01:21:01,189
You have one minute left.

1614
01:21:03,191 --> 01:21:05,694
I did things differently according to
the number we were aiming for.

1615
01:21:05,777 --> 01:21:08,363
Like this if it was a prime number.
Like that if there was a factor.

1616
01:21:08,446 --> 01:21:10,907
And something else
if the number was smaller than ten.

1617
01:21:10,991 --> 01:21:14,536
I think I found my own little way
of doing everything.

1618
01:21:14,619 --> 01:21:15,912
That concludes Round 5.

1619
01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:22,961
Here are the scores.

1620
01:21:24,170 --> 01:21:26,047
This happened
because I misread that letter.

1621
01:21:26,131 --> 01:21:27,966
Here is the board for Round 6.

1622
01:21:29,134 --> 01:21:30,927
Here is the target number.

1623
01:21:32,971 --> 01:21:34,556
This one is difficult.

1624
01:21:38,810 --> 01:21:39,811
Jeong Hyun-gyu.

1625
01:21:41,646 --> 01:21:43,982
I'll go for I, B, G.

1626
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:47,611
That is correct.
You have acquired one point.

1627
01:21:47,694 --> 01:21:48,695
Okay.

1628
01:21:50,822 --> 01:21:52,032
You have one minute left.

1629
01:21:54,951 --> 01:21:56,328
A, B, E.

1630
01:21:58,997 --> 01:21:59,998
Choi Hyun-joon.

1631
01:22:00,081 --> 01:22:02,876
A, B, E.

1632
01:22:02,959 --> 01:22:03,960
That is correct.

1633
01:22:04,669 --> 01:22:06,046
All correct answers have now been found.

1634
01:22:06,129 --> 01:22:07,714
That concludes Round 6.

1635
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:11,217
Wow, they're doing great.

1636
01:22:11,301 --> 01:22:13,470
-Good luck.
-Okay.

1637
01:22:13,553 --> 01:22:15,931
Here is the board for Round 7.

1638
01:22:19,059 --> 01:22:21,603
Here is the target number.

1639
01:22:26,816 --> 01:22:27,817
Jeong Hyun-gyu.

1640
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:31,363
I'll go for C, I, H.

1641
01:22:31,446 --> 01:22:34,574
That is correct.
You have acquired one point.

1642
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:38,161
Jeong Hyun-gyu.

1643
01:22:38,703 --> 01:22:40,705
I'll go for D, E, A.

1644
01:22:40,789 --> 01:22:43,750
That is correct.
You have acquired one point.

1645
01:22:45,961 --> 01:22:47,337
Jeong Hyun-gyu.

1646
01:22:47,420 --> 01:22:48,588
E, B, G.

1647
01:22:49,130 --> 01:22:51,925
That is correct.
You have acquired one point.

1648
01:22:53,218 --> 01:22:54,344
Jeong Hyun-gyu.

1649
01:22:54,427 --> 01:22:56,888
I'll go for G, B, F.

1650
01:22:56,972 --> 01:22:59,391
That is correct.
You have acquired one point.

1651
01:22:59,474 --> 01:23:01,101
Wow, he's nailing this.

1652
01:23:02,018 --> 01:23:04,980
With a points gap like this
and not many rounds left,

1653
01:23:05,063 --> 01:23:07,482
I thought
I might actually end up going home.

1654
01:23:07,565 --> 01:23:09,734
However, out of this season's players,

1655
01:23:09,818 --> 01:23:13,571
I think I was the one who most engendered
the spirit of The Devil's Plan

1656
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:16,366
in my gameplay,
and I'm quite proud of that.

1657
01:23:16,449 --> 01:23:18,827
So, I thought,
"I'd keep trying until the bitter end."

1658
01:23:20,620 --> 01:23:21,997
Choi Hyun-joon.

1659
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:23,331
D, C, E.

1660
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:26,292
That is correct.
You have acquired one point.

1661
01:23:30,213 --> 01:23:32,382
-Choi Hyun-joon.
-I, B, E.

1662
01:23:32,465 --> 01:23:35,427
That is correct.
You have acquired one point.

1663
01:23:36,553 --> 01:23:38,304
-Choi Hyun-joon.
-A, C, F.

1664
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:41,224
That is correct.
You have acquired one point.

1665
01:23:41,307 --> 01:23:42,600
You have ten seconds left.

1666
01:23:42,684 --> 01:23:43,685
You're good.

1667
01:23:46,438 --> 01:23:47,731
That concludes Round 7.

1668
01:23:52,819 --> 01:23:54,487
Here are the scores.

1669
01:23:59,826 --> 01:24:02,037
Here is the board for Round 8.

1670
01:24:03,204 --> 01:24:05,206
Here is the target number.

1671
01:24:07,834 --> 01:24:09,002
Jeong Hyun-gyu.

1672
01:24:09,085 --> 01:24:10,837
I'll go for E, C, I.

1673
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:12,005
That is correct.

1674
01:24:12,839 --> 01:24:13,923
Jeong Hyun-gyu.

1675
01:24:14,007 --> 01:24:15,842
I'll go for F, H, C.

1676
01:24:16,342 --> 01:24:18,845
That is correct.
You have acquired one point.

1677
01:24:21,097 --> 01:24:24,976
In that situation, my mind started
to go blank, and I started to panic a bit.

1678
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:28,021
And from that point on,
I started to lose the mental battle.

1679
01:24:29,522 --> 01:24:30,523
Jeong Hyun-gyu.

1680
01:24:31,649 --> 01:24:33,443
I'll go for D, H, C.

1681
01:24:34,277 --> 01:24:35,445
That is incorrect.

1682
01:24:39,991 --> 01:24:41,201
You lose one point.

1683
01:24:42,786 --> 01:24:44,412
What did I say?

1684
01:24:44,496 --> 01:24:46,247
You said D, H, C.

1685
01:24:46,790 --> 01:24:48,208
That concludes Round 8.

1686
01:24:50,794 --> 01:24:52,337
Here are the scores.

1687
01:24:58,968 --> 01:25:01,888
Here is the board for Round 9.

1688
01:25:07,602 --> 01:25:09,270
Here is the target number.

1689
01:25:29,332 --> 01:25:30,583
You have one minute left.

1690
01:25:33,461 --> 01:25:34,587
Jeong Hyun-gyu.

1691
01:25:38,049 --> 01:25:39,259
What did he find?

1692
01:25:44,430 --> 01:25:47,058
F, A, E.

1693
01:25:48,143 --> 01:25:49,477
That is correct.

1694
01:25:49,561 --> 01:25:51,020
All correct answers have now been found.

1695
01:25:51,104 --> 01:25:52,105
That concludes Round 9.

1696
01:25:52,188 --> 01:25:53,565
This is difficult.

1697
01:25:54,774 --> 01:25:56,192
Here are the scores.

1698
01:25:59,863 --> 01:26:02,657
Here is the board for Round 10.

1699
01:26:04,033 --> 01:26:05,869
Here is the target number.

1700
01:26:13,376 --> 01:26:14,377
Choi Hyun-joon.

1701
01:26:15,795 --> 01:26:17,130
F, C, A.

1702
01:26:17,797 --> 01:26:20,466
That is correct.
You have acquired one point.

1703
01:26:21,384 --> 01:26:23,052
-Choi Hyun-joon.
-I, E, G.

1704
01:26:23,595 --> 01:26:25,889
That is correct.
You have acquired one point.

1705
01:26:30,185 --> 01:26:31,186
Choi Hyun-joon.

1706
01:26:31,269 --> 01:26:32,437
E, F, D.

1707
01:26:33,146 --> 01:26:35,440
That is correct.
You have acquired one point.

1708
01:26:39,068 --> 01:26:42,405
J, E, F.

1709
01:26:52,498 --> 01:26:53,374
Jeong Hyun-gyu.

1710
01:26:56,085 --> 01:26:58,463
-J, E, F.
-I was just about to say that.

1711
01:26:58,546 --> 01:26:59,631
That's what I just saw.

1712
01:26:59,714 --> 01:27:02,050
That is correct.
You have acquired one point.

1713
01:27:03,092 --> 01:27:04,260
Jeong Hyun-gyu.

1714
01:27:04,802 --> 01:27:05,970
D, F, B.

1715
01:27:06,554 --> 01:27:08,514
That is correct.
You have acquired one point.

1716
01:27:09,140 --> 01:27:10,475
You have ten seconds left.

1717
01:27:17,649 --> 01:27:18,983
That concludes Round 10.

1718
01:27:20,401 --> 01:27:21,861
It was so difficult.

1719
01:27:23,196 --> 01:27:26,449
Good game. And that was so much fun.

1720
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:28,451
Good job.

1721
01:27:28,534 --> 01:27:30,161
The final results are

1722
01:27:30,245 --> 01:27:33,164
Jeong Hyun-gyu with 16 points

1723
01:27:33,248 --> 01:27:35,833
and Choi Hyun-joon with 11 points.

1724
01:27:35,917 --> 01:27:38,169
Consequently, Choi Hyun-joon

1725
01:27:38,253 --> 01:27:41,881
becomes the twelfth player
eliminated from The Devil's Plan.

1726
01:27:41,965 --> 01:27:43,883
-That was fun.
-It was fun. I don't have any regrets.

1727
01:27:43,967 --> 01:27:44,884
Choi Hyun-joon…

1728
01:27:44,968 --> 01:27:47,178
-I'm not even sad.
-…please leave this place immediately.

1729
01:27:47,262 --> 01:27:48,513
That's what I was hoping for.

1730
01:27:48,596 --> 01:27:51,975
I showed everything I could do
during The Devil's Plan.

1731
01:27:52,475 --> 01:27:56,145
And I've been so busy with life

1732
01:27:56,229 --> 01:28:00,149
that I haven't really had the opportunity
to figure out who I am.

1733
01:28:00,233 --> 01:28:01,776
But here, I realized,

1734
01:28:01,859 --> 01:28:07,323
"It's because I have that desperation
that I was able to last here this long."

1735
01:28:07,407 --> 01:28:13,579
Because I probably had the strongest
desire to survive in The Devil's Plan.

1736
01:28:13,663 --> 01:28:15,707
I was probably more earnest
than other people,

1737
01:28:15,790 --> 01:28:18,918
and it was really special
because not many people in the world

1738
01:28:19,002 --> 01:28:20,003
get to experience this.

1739
01:28:20,086 --> 01:28:26,718
I think I'll remember it forever.
Until the day I die.

1740
01:28:26,801 --> 01:28:28,052
Thank you.

1741
01:28:28,136 --> 01:28:29,971
When we get out, let's play board games.

1742
01:28:30,054 --> 01:28:30,888
See you.

1743
01:28:30,972 --> 01:28:32,473
I'll buy you some nice food.

1744
01:28:32,557 --> 01:28:33,558
See you tomorrow.

1745
01:28:33,641 --> 01:28:35,059
Enjoy the living area.

1746
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:39,856
That concludes the prison match.

1747
01:28:39,939 --> 01:28:43,192
Jeong Hyun-gyu,
please make your way to the living area.

1748
01:29:05,757 --> 01:29:06,924
It was tough.

1749
01:29:07,008 --> 01:29:08,593
I've played like a devil.

1750
01:29:09,719 --> 01:29:12,055
But I don't need to be a devil
in the final match.

1751
01:29:14,223 --> 01:29:16,017
Since it is the final,

1752
01:29:16,100 --> 01:29:19,812
I'm going to put everything down
and try to play with a smile on my face.

1753
01:29:28,279 --> 01:29:29,405
-Wow!
-Were you watching?

1754
01:29:29,489 --> 01:29:31,908
Hyun-gyu!
Of course I was watching. I knew it.

1755
01:31:16,345 --> 01:31:19,474
-I'm touched. It was fun.
-It was amazing. Yes.

1756
01:31:19,557 --> 01:31:21,267
It all feels like a dream.

1757
01:31:21,350 --> 01:31:22,351
Yes.

1758
01:31:23,311 --> 01:31:26,772
It really seems like the games have gone
in totally unexpected directions

1759
01:31:26,856 --> 01:31:28,941
with so many twists and turns.

1760
01:31:29,025 --> 01:31:31,277
-But hasn't it been fun?
-It's been a lot of fun.

1761
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:33,613
I was lying down earlier
and thinking about

1762
01:31:33,696 --> 01:31:35,531
everything that's happened
since the first day,

1763
01:31:36,282 --> 01:31:37,366
and everything was so fun.

1764
01:31:37,450 --> 01:31:38,451
-Right.
-Yes.

1765
01:31:40,786 --> 01:31:45,458
But looking back,
I kind of feel like I killed everyone.

1766
01:31:45,541 --> 01:31:46,918
That's not true.

1767
01:31:47,001 --> 01:31:49,837
So, when they all left…

1768
01:31:52,298 --> 01:31:54,967
I didn't really have
the courage to see them off.

1769
01:31:56,302 --> 01:31:59,305
Almost everyone
is a nice person to some people

1770
01:31:59,388 --> 01:32:01,140
and a bad one to others.

1771
01:32:01,224 --> 01:32:02,308
You're right.

1772
01:32:06,354 --> 01:32:08,439
I think my feelings
have become more honest.

1773
01:32:08,523 --> 01:32:11,234
Yes, I think I'm leaving here
having gained a lot.

1774
01:32:11,317 --> 01:32:12,401
Right.

1775
01:32:12,485 --> 01:32:15,071
Risk your life
and really go for it tomorrow.

1776
01:32:15,154 --> 01:32:20,743
I hope you'll play with the mind-set of
"I'll win even if I have to bust a gut."

1777
01:32:20,826 --> 01:32:24,914
I think that's a courtesy
to both me and Kyuhyun.

1778
01:32:24,997 --> 01:32:26,123
-Right.
-Yes.

1779
01:32:26,874 --> 01:32:28,543
Let's try our best tomorrow.

1780
01:32:29,335 --> 01:32:30,836
-We have to.
-Yes.

1781
01:32:33,506 --> 01:32:36,509
