1
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:17,684
I'm good.
I feel like I'm in great condition.

2
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:19,853
I feel a sense of relief.

3
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:25,525
Actually, I went to sleep quite late
after talking with Hyun-gyu.

4
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:28,445
Still, I feel like I slept well.

5
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,363
I'm in good shape.

6
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,457
Did you sleep well?

7
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,250
-It was okay.
-Did you go straight to sleep?

8
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,252
-I fell asleep almost straightaway.
-That's good.

9
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,130
-We'll be seeing Kyuhyun in a bit.
-I know.

10
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,591
-I think he'll be happy.
-I think so too.

11
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,844
Why don't I have an appetite?

12
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,265
Eat up.

13
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:00,060
I can't get it down.

14
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:04,939
I had been feeling a little heartburn,

15
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:09,652
and the smell of the food
was making my stomach turn.

16
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,489
If the chef sees this,
they would be so sad.

17
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:13,740
Perhaps…

18
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,785
-Because I hardly touched it?
-Exactly.

19
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,411
But I really can't stomach it.

20
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,080
I normally eat well.

21
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,296
I can't believe we're going home.

22
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:33,551
From the first meeting
for The Devil's Plan to this moment,

23
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:37,472
I've been going over everything, thinking,
"Just what have I been through?"

24
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:40,016
I'm getting a little nervous.

25
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,559
Hello.

26
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:42,852
KICKOFF MEETING

27
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,854
So it's a type of survival game

28
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:48,024
where a lot of smart people
are gathered together.

29
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:52,320
I'm wondering if I'd be able to do it.

30
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:55,365
I'm really competitive,
so it's all or nothing.

31
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,283
I can also be super tenacious.

32
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,702
If I have to eliminate someone,

33
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:03,915
and if it's a competition where
I have to put other people down,

34
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:06,042
I find that kind of thing really taxing.

35
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,002
-I want to win.
-Just flat out?

36
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:10,380
Yes, I don't want to be eliminated early.

37
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,215
Hello.

38
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,843
Hello. No wonder. He looked familiar…

39
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:15,760
MORNING, DAY 1

40
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,721
To be honest, I haven't seen EXchange.

41
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:22,142
Hello, I am 26-year old
college student Jeong Hyun-gyu.

42
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:24,853
I get the feeling that this season,

43
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:27,313
alliances won't really last that long.

44
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:31,276
The first main match of The Devil's Plan
is Corrupt Police.

45
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,406
-There's definitely a saboteur.
-Red keeps acting oddly.

46
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,699
-CHUU.
-Yes?

47
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:40,326
Please go up. And I'll go this way.

48
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,786
-Really?
-She's going back.

49
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,829
Really?

50
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:44,289
-Good for us.
-No way, she just…

51
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:48,793
Hyun-gyu has been amazing
from start to finish.

52
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,170
I feel that every time I see him.

53
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:52,672
So-hui and I are very similar.

54
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:53,590
EVENING, DAY 1

55
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,258
I don't think
it's the right time to go in.

56
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,927
-I'm willing to give up one of my Pieces.
-Me too.

57
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,430
So-hui has a touch of
madness about her. Just like me.

58
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,765
They're both clear
but with a touch of madness.

59
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,642
There's been a sort of synergy between us.

60
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:07,270
I tend to get caught up in one thing,

61
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:10,982
and So-hui stops me from
tipping over the edge or making mistakes.

62
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:12,483
Hey, doesn't that say "insert"?

63
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,611
-That says, "insert."
-Amazing.

64
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,196
It says, "insert," right?

65
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:19,490
She's very keen, super quick,
and has a firm mentality.

66
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:21,492
-47, 48, 49.
-You got it.

67
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:25,330
-Wow, amazing.
-That was so tough.

68
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:26,497
You're a natural.

69
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,166
-Well done.
-No, not at all.

70
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:30,084
It's Juliet.

71
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,753
Has anyone figured out the blue one?

72
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,713
-I found the blue one.
-Really?

73
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:35,882
She's smart. She really is a smart person.

74
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,884
She's a worthy opponent.

75
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:42,722
Hyun-gyu is quick at calculating
and good at anticipating moves.

76
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:43,806
You have succeeded.

77
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,893
Would they really use
a Piece and a Grenade to get one monster?

78
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:47,977
It's worth trying.

79
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,729
-You want me to call him? 7high?
-Yes.

80
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:51,231
When he makes a move,

81
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:54,901
he's already calculated in his head
what the other person is going to do.

82
00:03:57,153 --> 00:04:00,615
On the other hand,
when it comes to solving problems,

83
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:02,951
I might be a bit quicker.

84
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:05,703
He's really depressed and gutted now.

85
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:08,081
I just can't do that to Hyun-gyu.

86
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:09,916
I just need a moment to think about it…

87
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:13,169
I think her weak point is
that she's too soft.

88
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,129
To put it simply,

89
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:16,673
she's not a devil.

90
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,341
Whereas I'm a natural-born devil.

91
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,342
Then, you kill her.

92
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,678
However, you have to forfeit the item.

93
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:22,720
Spend some cash.

94
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,055
Do you know how to do arithmetic?

95
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:26,266
Hyun-joon. I'm sorry.

96
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:28,977
I would like to use
my reward from the hidden stage.

97
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:34,190
In here, everything goes
except theft and violence.

98
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,566
That's what The Devil's Plan is about.

99
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,904
And I think that so far,
I've played to fit the bill.

100
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:43,366
I know I've sounded
like I have no ambitions,

101
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,867
but I do.

102
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,537
The winner of today's main match
is Yoon So-hui.

103
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,914
The player with the most Pieces,
Yoon So-hui.

104
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:53,167
Yoon So-hui qualifies for the final match.

105
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:56,296
I've made it this far,
so I want to put up a good fight.

106
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,881
It was our aim to make it this far,

107
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:02,677
and now it's time
to fight fair and square.

108
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,597
I think it's time for me
to take off the devil's mask

109
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:10,101
and play mano a mano,
player versus player.

110
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:12,562
I feel good,
because I'm playing against So-hui.

111
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:16,899
I think it took our combined strength
to make it this far.

112
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:21,487
But now that it's just the two of us,
I won't give him an inch.

113
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:24,574
I'll play fair and square
using my skills to win.

114
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:32,081
-I hope Kyuhyun is first through the door.
-Me too.

115
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,249
Kyuhyun and Tinno.

116
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,712
-I want to chat with Sang-yeon as well.
-Right, Sang-yeon.

117
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:41,007
-I suppose Justin will be here too?
-I'm sure everyone will come.

118
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,759
I'm curious how Se-dol will react.

119
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,886
-I think he'll be funny.
-Really?

120
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:46,054
Who else is there?

121
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:48,389
7high is a bit…

122
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:51,309
I think I'll be happy to see him,
but I'm scared too.

123
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:53,102
Multiple emotions at the same time.

124
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,979
Things didn't turn out
the way he had hoped.

125
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,315
But I don't think anyone has
ill feelings towards you.

126
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:59,317
-I hope not.
-I'm sure they won't.

127
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,486
All I can do is hope.
I really behaved like a devil.

128
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:04,655
You weren't like a devil. You played well.

129
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,240
I think the name is perfect.

130
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:10,203
-"The plan of devils."
-Yeah.

131
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,581
Someone's here.

132
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:15,625
-Your majesty, please go in.
-Thank you very much.

133
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:16,709
-Hello, everyone.
-Follow her in.

134
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:17,794
DAY 6 ELIMINATION
SON EUN-YU

135
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,212
-Congratulations.
-Hello!

136
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:20,588
What? Is this how it is?

137
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,715
Hey, it really worked out
according to "The Devil's Plan."

138
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,133
Congratulations, So-hui.

139
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,551
-Congrats.
-Thanks.

140
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:26,803
Hey, Hyun-gyu.

141
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,138
-I'm sorry, Eun-yu.
-So what happened in the end?

142
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,099
-I went to prison.
-You finally ended up in prison?

143
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,017
-Yes.
-When did that happen?

144
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,143
You've been through a lot.

145
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,604
Yes, make sure you give it your all, okay?

146
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:38,231
-Okay, I will.
-Good.

147
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:40,400
-Well done.
-You managed to survive in prison?

148
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,235
-Go and do it. Make it interesting.
-Where did you sleep?

149
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:43,820
-Probably at home.
-I came right back.

150
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,197
-̨For three hours?
-You're what I imagine the Devil to be.

151
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,448
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

152
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,992
Everything went according your plan.

153
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,161
-"The Devil's Plan."
-Right, "The Devil's Plan."

154
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,538
How far does Hyun-gyu's plan go?

155
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:56,541
Today, it's not Hyun-gyu
that looks like the devil, it's you.

156
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,461
-Yeah, a bit.
-Because of your hair.

157
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,380
It's not that, I just look angry.

158
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,091
I've still got my mad face on.

159
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,262
DAY 5 ELIMINATION
KYUHYUN

160
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:11,931
-Oh, my God.
-There he is.

161
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:13,766
-I missed you.
-Ji-yeong.

162
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,017
Kyuhyun.

163
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,436
-Did you keep your promise?
-Huh?

164
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,312
-Did you keep your promise?
-Yes.

165
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,189
-It was really tough.
-Well done.

166
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,524
You stuck it out.

167
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:22,775
-So-hui.
-Kyuhyun.

168
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:24,861
-Did you make it through okay?
-Yes.

169
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,529
-Is it the two of you left?
-Yes.

170
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:29,657
-So then, that's how things turned out.
-Exactly.

171
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,534
-It's the two of you?
-Yes, it's the two of them.

172
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:32,827
It's you two?

173
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,037
This game turned out
exactly how the devil planned it.

174
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,540
I went up against Hyun-gyu
in the last death match and lost.

175
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:40,501
Watch it when it airs.
We really fought to the bitter end.

176
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:43,337
-I'm sure you did.
-We really tried so hard.

177
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:46,507
Justin!

178
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:47,925
-Hello.
-How have you been?

179
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,719
Justin, Tinno.

180
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,053
Oh, my God!

181
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,513
-Oh, my God!
-Welcome.

182
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:53,514
-Hi, Tinno.
-Justin.

183
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:54,724
It's so good to see you.

184
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:55,808
How are you?

185
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:58,144
-I'm so sorry. For sending you to prison.
-No, no, don't worry.

186
00:07:58,227 --> 00:07:59,437
DAY 4 ELIMINATION
TINNO

187
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,774
Unbelievable.

188
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,417
Justin, nice to see you again.

189
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,128
-Congrats, Congrats.
-Thank you.

190
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,172
I knew it. The two of you.

191
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:28,341
-You thought it would be us? Really?
-Yeah.

192
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:29,592
Thank you.

193
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:32,220
So-hui's finally smiling. At last.

194
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,515
Hello.

195
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:38,059
-Hi, Ha-rin.
-How has everyone been?

196
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,769
Ha-rin, you're looking so cute.

197
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,646
-Oh my, Ha-rin.
-She's not in a red dress.

198
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,689
-Hey, you're not in red.
-Hey, Ha-rin.

199
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,024
You look so cute.

200
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:46,108
Why are you wearing white?

201
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,152
-I'm dressed in white today.
-You have clothes like this?

202
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,779
It's time to leave the red behind.

203
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,572
I thought you only had red clothes.

204
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:54,033
-Ha-rin. You look so cute.
-How have you been?

205
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:55,826
-I'm sorry.
-What are you sorry about?

206
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,744
Ha-rin!

207
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:59,163
If you were truly sorry,
you should have given me a Piece.

208
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,207
Se-dol's here as well.

209
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,792
-You traitor!
-Hey, backstabber.

210
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,752
You should be over there.
What are you doing here?

211
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:06,254
-Se-dol.
-Hello.

212
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:08,756
You shouldn't be here.

213
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,383
She got through to the final.

214
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:12,009
-Right?
-Yes, she's in the final.

215
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,553
Thank you.

216
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:17,181
In my dressing room,
I kept saying So-hui would make it.

217
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,433
-Really? You thought she'd make it?
-Yes.

218
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:20,393
Hello.

219
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:21,936
Also a finalist.

220
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,980
Now he's befitting
of someone in the final.

221
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:24,981
Yes, a finalist.

222
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,527
-Sang-yeon.
-Sang-yeon!

223
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,861
DAY 2 ELIMINATION
PARK SANG-YEON, LEE SEUNG-HYUN

224
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:31,988
Seung-hyun!

225
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,282
-Goodness, Seung-hyun.
-Hello.

226
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,450
-Poor thing.
-What are you doing here?

227
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:37,994
7high, Sang-yeon is here.

228
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,579
-Hey.
-Sang-yeon's here!

229
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,872
Sang-yeon, do you know how much
I've been thinking about you?

230
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,791
-7high.
-Hey, you darn genius.

231
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:45,960
There's so much more you had to show.

232
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:48,588
Seung-hyun,
we didn't even get a chance to talk.

233
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:51,591
-Exactly.
-I feel so awkward right now.

234
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,426
What did you do while on the show?

235
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,970
I left in such horrible fashion.

236
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:57,054
I broke out of that.

237
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,931
Really? Amazing.

238
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:01,517
DAY 1 ELIMINATION
CHUU

239
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,435
Hello.

240
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:04,061
-CHUU, you're here!
-Hi!

241
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,730
-I missed you.
-Good to see you all.

242
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:06,897
CHUU!

243
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,858
CHUU!

244
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,819
I really missed you all.
You all made it out alive.

245
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:13,696
-CHUU.
-Kyuhyun.

246
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,573
-CHUU.
-Forget it!

247
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:16,991
I'm sorry.

248
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:20,077
-Honestly, CHUU, he's our public enemy.
-Eun-yu.

249
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,746
Are you still sore about that?

250
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:25,041
-That was the first day.
-He betrayed me three times.

251
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,125
-Three times?
-Ji-yeong!

252
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,711
CHUU, but after all that,
Ji-yeong ended up betraying me.

253
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,881
-Really?
-CHUU, I eliminated Kyuhyun.

254
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,884
-Oh my! Well done!
-I got my revenge.

255
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,927
I still gave you my Pieces.

256
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,596
You really didn't give them to me.

257
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,556
-I took them from you.
-You took them.

258
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,141
-They were my reward.
-Well done.

259
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:43,476
I'm so curious.

260
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:46,020
I'm really curious
what you're all talking about.

261
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:47,938
We weren't talking to each other.

262
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:50,691
-A lot has happened.
-We weren't speaking.

263
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:53,402
I'm so curious about these stories.
I don't know anything.

264
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,237
Still, it worked out well,
if you two made it.

265
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,991
I imagined you two getting to the final
and Eun-yu never getting out of prison.

266
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,494
Those two things
were what I thought would happen.

267
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,329
-And that's what's happened.
-I was in tears.

268
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:04,622
-You cried?
-Yes.

269
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:07,416
I knew So-hui was crying.
Your eyes were red too. Did you cry?

270
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,294
-He was crying. I was really surprised.
-Hey, you cried?

271
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,213
He was sitting there like this.

272
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:23,099
I thought you didn't cry.

273
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,850
But it was you leaving.

274
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:26,644
Sure.

275
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:28,229
Anyway,
I'm glad everything worked out well.

276
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:29,522
Thanks.

277
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,982
Remember you said we could do a 5x5?

278
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:34,568
Don't you think it'll be a 5x5 or 6x6?

279
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,987
When we get there, it might be an 8x8.

280
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:39,907
If that happens, we have to sue somebody.

281
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,368
It was 8x8.

282
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:43,828
-But when he went in…
-It was 8x8?

283
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:46,080
-But Hyun-gyu solved it. Yes.
-An 8x8?

284
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:48,165
-How did he solve an 8x8?
-He solved an 8x8.

285
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,750
-8x8?
-It was an 8x8.

286
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,503
-What was 8x8?
-An 8x8 Knight's Tour.

287
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,505
Here? No, it was 5x5, 6x6 and 7x7.

288
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:55,589
I did it.

289
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:56,590
Nice!

290
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:01,470
-What was the game?
-Just 5x5, 6x6 and 7x7. Blind.

291
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,347
-Was it not?
-He told me it was 6x6, 7x7, and 8x8?

292
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,224
Was it 7x7 and 8x8?

293
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:07,059
-That's impossible.
-That could also be a lie.

294
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,602
-It was 7x7 and 8x8.
-Wait a moment.

295
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,187
Ji-yeong, how many is it?

296
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,773
Has he done nothing but lie
from beginning to end?

297
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,233
-Hyun-gyu, that puzzle you solved,
-Yes.

298
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,277
-wasn't it 5x5, 6x7, and 7x7?
-It was up to 8x8.

299
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:18,946
I solved it with one minute to spare.

300
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,865
So you lied about that to us as well?

301
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:21,949
Yes.

302
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,868
Well, the reward was hidden Pieces…

303
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,286
-Ji-yeong.
-Honestly.

304
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:26,495
I'm sorry.

305
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,998
That was the only thing I lied about.
Nothing else.

306
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,166
-I'm sorry.
-Ji-yeong.

307
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,877
-Yeah?
-I didn't lie as much as you think.

308
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,920
-Well, you lied right to my face.
-I did lie right to your face.

309
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,547
-I did indeed.
-Yes, right to my face.

310
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,673
-Yes, you did.
-I'm sorry.

311
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,467
Whichever of you ends up winning,

312
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,595
-this is huge.
-Yes, that's why I feel at ease.

313
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,680
I hear you two made it through.

314
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,265
-Right.
-Congratulations.

315
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:49,185
I felt so bad
while watching the prison match.

316
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,644
-No need.
-Right hand, left hand.

317
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:53,314
-Yes, right.
-Oh, did you know?

318
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:54,440
Yes, we were watching.

319
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:55,775
-We watched it.
-Really?

320
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,359
-It looked really hard.
-You couldn't talk.

321
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,527
-Did you get some sleep?
-Yes.

322
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,321
-I slept well.
-Did you? That's good.

323
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:02,239
-After drinking a lot of beer.
-Really?

324
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,033
-He drank a lot.
-Really?

325
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,243
-I was so exhausted because of prison.
-Really?

326
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,870
I went to prison
for the first time yesterday.

327
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:10,164
Prison was quite extreme.

328
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:12,583
-Eun-yu was in prison for six days.
-Really?

329
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,126
What? Six days?

330
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,214
Eun-yu, you were in prison for six days?

331
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:21,717
Yes, after you left.

332
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,052
For six days?

333
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,971
But six days? I'm really shocked.

334
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,140
That shouldn't be allowed
on humanitarian grounds.

335
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,851
I was in prison until I got knocked out
in yesterday's main match.

336
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,770
-You never spent one night here?
-Not even one.

337
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:34,855
-So, just like me.
-That's right.

338
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,525
Now that you've made it to the final,
go win it.

339
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:38,734
That was your plan all along.

340
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,153
-We're both going to try our hardest.
-I'm sure.

341
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,072
But I'll be openly supporting you.

342
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:46,575
This was Hyun-gyu's plan,
and it worked out exactly how he wanted.

343
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,953
If he was that desperate to win,

344
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:52,873
I think it's only right that he wins.

345
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,959
Hey, everyone!
There's lots of good food here.

346
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:58,671
-Eun-yu, you go first. Dig in.
-This is my first time!

347
00:13:58,754 --> 00:13:59,755
I'm first.

348
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,173
You've never eaten this.

349
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,800
-Let's go.
-In here, you're number one.

350
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:05,469
I can't believe you had protein over here.

351
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,012
-Yes, we did.
-There's meat.

352
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,390
-We had it all the time.
-We only had balanced meals.

353
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:11,517
The food was really great.

354
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:17,481
I mean, you put me up
against people who had been eating that?

355
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:18,774
What's this?

356
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,487
Have you been eating like this every day?

357
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:25,948
Hey, have you noticed this?

358
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:28,284
The only people interested in the food
were the four prisoners.

359
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,077
Nobody else cares.

360
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,288
I think the game itself will be important.

361
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,331
If it's a game that Hyun-gyu likes…

362
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,750
-But…
-…or if it's a game that you like.

363
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:40,170
-We're both so different.
-You're different. She's very calm.

364
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,797
-Yes, she is.
-Yes, So-hui is calm.

365
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:45,342
Whenever I played with So-hui,
she never got emotional.

366
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:54,435
I think it would be really nice
if a woman got the achievement

367
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:57,271
of winning this kind of survival game.

368
00:14:57,354 --> 00:15:01,358
And since I've been connected to her
since the start,

369
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:07,239
I think If So-hui wins, it might feel
like I'm along for the ride too.

370
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,742
So, yes. I hope So-hui wins.

371
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:12,578
Hyun-gyu, I really hope you win.

372
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:16,206
I really wanted to help you out more.
It was such a shame what happened to you.

373
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,666
I have high hopes for you.

374
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:21,128
-Become the youngest winner ever.
-Is that true? Would I be?

375
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:23,672
I mean,
students like us have never won anything.

376
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,174
It'd be nice we won for once.

377
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,009
You have to eat before the big game.

378
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,511
But I can't really eat right now.

379
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,055
-Really?
-I've been feeling queasy.

380
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:33,057
Really? Then why don't you sit down?

381
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,183
Let's sit down.

382
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,601
Yes, sit down.

383
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:39,813
I don't know who I should support.
I've been supporting both of you so far.

384
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,148
Just enjoy the game.

385
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:43,776
You two are who I played the most with.

386
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:46,946
Hyun-gyu is really good
at understanding games.

387
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:51,158
He also has a good understanding
of how to strategize to win.

388
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,952
And he's quick at calculating moves.

389
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:58,165
As for So-hui, she plays a game once,
and she becomes scarily good at it.

390
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:01,210
And she's outstanding at math
and calculation-related things.

391
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:06,215
So, I'd be happy no matter who wins.

392
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,258
I'm so proud of my guys.

393
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,844
Exactly. I feel exactly the same.
"My guys."

394
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:13,347
-Yes, they're my guys.
-I do hope my guys do well.

395
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,766
Tinno, I talked about you so much
when we were drinking.

396
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:18,268
About how I found you
to be such a good friend

397
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:19,770
though we'd known for a short time.

398
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:21,397
Thanks for saying that.

399
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,232
I really missed hearing your voice.

400
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,359
So I listened to your songs before bed.
Seriously.

401
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:26,527
-My songs?
-Yes.

402
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:27,945
Yeah, while falling asleep.

403
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,489
I looked Justin up.

404
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:31,907
-Oh, me too.
-Justin.

405
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,743
I'm sorry. I didn't know…
He's really famous.

406
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:35,744
-Oh, really?
-No.

407
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,539
I didn't know you were in BEEF.

408
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:40,290
We're close, right?

409
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:42,334
We ate bread together.

410
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,795
-I poured you some milk.
-You're right.

411
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:47,214
-But you're lactose intolerant.
-Right.

412
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:49,758
It's nice to see Eun-yu
wearing regular clothes.

413
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:50,843
-Right?
-I feel so awkward.

414
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:53,303
When I was getting my makeup
and hair done,

415
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,014
it just felt awkward and wrong.

416
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,766
-Eun-yu. You look just like a lawyer.
-Right, you're a lawyer.

417
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,851
Hey!

418
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:02,479
You were the only one
whose job I couldn't remember.

419
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:03,981
-Really?
-Like, "Was she an inmate?"

420
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:07,693
Hey! Honestly, you're so mean.

421
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,530
Hyun-gyu, are you nervous?

422
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:12,698
-I'm really nervous.
-Of course.

423
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:16,368
Really? But you look so calm.

424
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:17,870
He's putting on a poker face.

425
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:20,414
Hyun-gyu's really good
at putting on a poker face.

426
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:23,417
-Good luck, Hyun-gyu.
-I'll play like I have so far.

427
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,128
Honestly, you were
the one person I respected.

428
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,963
-Let's play later.
-Good luck. Okay.

429
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:31,759
Amazing.

430
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:34,887
The final match will begin soon.

431
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,056
The two finalists,

432
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,558
please make your way to the game area.

433
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:40,642
Good luck!

434
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,187
-Good luck.
-Good luck, both of you.

435
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,480
Best of luck.

436
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:47,149
-So-hui, you're going to do fine.
-Good luck. You got this.

437
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,442
Off you go.

438
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:49,735
-You got this.
-I got this.

439
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:51,403
-Make it good.
-Give it your best shot.

440
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,781
We'll be watching closely.

441
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:54,740
We'll be right here,

442
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,533
-on the other side of the wall.
-Good luck.

443
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:00,162
-Good luck, Hyun-gyu.
-Give it your best.

444
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,663
-Good luck!
-Wow, we can't go in.

445
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,207
Good luck, both of you!

446
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,501
-Good luck!
-Stay strong!

447
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:06,418
See you!

448
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,922
-Now that I see it, this door is so cool.
-Yeah, so it is.

449
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:11,882
-Let's go for it.
-Okay.

450
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,219
Let's go.

451
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,939
So this is how it looks.

452
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:32,986
Greetings.

453
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:36,573
I congratulate both of you
on surviving all the way to the final

454
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,117
of The Devil's Plan.

455
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,537
Choi Hyun-joon was eliminated
in yesterday's prison match.

456
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:46,250
Hence, Yoon So-hui and Jeong Hyun-gyu
have advanced to the final match.

457
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,711
The total prize money accumulated
through the prize missions

458
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,798
amounts to 380 million won.

459
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:53,924
-380 million?
-That's crazy.

460
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:56,093
I think that's a pretty good haul
we've made.

461
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:58,220
-We really earned them a lot.
-I'd love to have 380 million.

462
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:02,057
The final match will proceed as follows.

463
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:05,477
Three games
will be played for the final match.

464
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,480
The first game of the final match
is Big or Small.

465
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:12,109
It is a betting game
that involves mind games.

466
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:14,361
-"Big or Small"?
-So it's a betting game.

467
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:16,572
The second game is Bagh Chal.

468
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:20,159
It is an abstract strategy game
with a long history.

469
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:23,537
The third game is Question and Truth.

470
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,997
What's that?

471
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:25,956
Must be a game of wits.

472
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:30,586
It is a game that requires problem-solving
skills and rapid deduction.

473
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:34,923
Whichever player wins two games first
will be the final winner,

474
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:38,927
and they will receive
the prize of 380 million won.

475
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:45,851
The final match to decide the winner
of The Devil's Plan will begin now.

476
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:09,833
THE DEVIL'S PLAN
DEATH ROOM

477
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:13,921
Here is the final Piece count
of the finalists.

478
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:16,298
Yoon So-hui has 14.

479
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,550
And Jeong Hyun-gyu has 11.

480
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,844
-So-hui has more.
-Wow, So-hui is in first?

481
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:21,929
Yes, I did that.

482
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:27,434
Here is the first game of the final match.

483
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:28,977
The first game of the final match is

484
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,229
Big or Small.

485
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:35,400
In Big or Small, one player contests
the dealer in a hand of cards,

486
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:40,489
while the other player bets
on the outcome.

487
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:46,536
Each player shall receive a deck of cards
numbered from 0 to 10 and 10 chips.

488
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,915
The dealer will use
a separate deck of cards

489
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:53,585
numbered from 1 to 9 for each player.

490
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:56,463
The game shall be played over 18 rounds.

491
00:20:56,546 --> 00:21:03,387
And each round, the contesting player
and the betting player shall swap roles.

492
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,638
This looks like fun.

493
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:05,973
Contest.

494
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:09,559
After shuffling the deck of cards
that is used for contesting,

495
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:13,563
the dealer plays the top card face up.

496
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:17,234
The contesting player checks
the dealer's card,

497
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:22,030
selects a card from their own deck,
and plays it face down.

498
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,157
Bet.

499
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,784
When both cards have been played,

500
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:28,787
the betting player must predict
the result of the contest.

501
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:32,708
If they think the contesting player's card
is higher than the dealer's card,

502
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:33,750
they shall bet big.

503
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:36,753
And if they think it's lower,
they shall bet small.

504
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,255
It's completely psychological.

505
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:42,175
Once the bet has been made,
the contesting player reveals their card.

506
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,304
The one with the higher card wins.

507
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:49,349
And if the contesting player wins,
they receive the same number of chips

508
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,435
as the difference in value
between the two cards.

509
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:56,356
If they lose or draw,
they receive no chips.

510
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,776
If the betting player's prediction
was correct,

511
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,820
they receive double the chips
they wagered.

512
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:06,116
If their prediction was wrong,
they lose all the chips they wagered.

513
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:09,870
And if it's a draw,
they receive their bet back.

514
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:11,538
Right, your ante gets returned.

515
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:16,335
The two cards used by the dealer
and the contesting player are removed.

516
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:20,130
The next hand will be played
with the remaining cards.

517
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:22,215
-Seems like it's countable.
-You have to memorize the cards.

518
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:25,969
The game shall end after all 18 rounds

519
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:31,391
or if either player loses all their chips.

520
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:37,189
Victory shall go to the player
with more chips.

521
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:42,110
The first game of the final match
will begin soon.

522
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:44,112
Seems difficult.

523
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:45,906
The betting.

524
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,408
He's nervous for the first time here.

525
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:49,368
Hyun-gyu is bricking it.

526
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:52,204
Wow, they both look nervous,
even through the screen.

527
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:56,708
You don't get new cards each round,

528
00:22:56,792 --> 00:23:00,587
you use the same cards all game
and lose one each round.

529
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,422
That means it's likely that

530
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:05,592
your opponent will be able to predict
more easily down the stretch.

531
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:08,428
So there's a risk of losing by betting.

532
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:11,181
And I think it's necessary
to keep that in mind.

533
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:13,350
If you look how Hyun-gyu plays,
when he bets,

534
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:17,020
he tries to read his opponent's moves,
so his betting is quite consistent.

535
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,355
Let's just skip this one.

536
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:20,190
No, I have to raise one.
Let's go with six.

537
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:25,570
So I will have to gamble in the middle
to be somewhat unpredictable.

538
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:28,240
I think So-hui will play it safe
with her bets.

539
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:34,413
My strategy will be to leave
as many big and small numbers as possible

540
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:39,709
and get rid of the ambiguous numbers in
the middle no matter which card comes out.

541
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:43,755
The contesting player must
be careful not to create a situation

542
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,341
where the outcome is certain
to be big or small.

543
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:50,470
For example, if the player has
already played all their high cards

544
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:53,890
and is unable to play a card
higher than the dealer's card,

545
00:23:53,974 --> 00:24:00,021
the betting player will be able to go
all-in on small and double their chips.

546
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:03,984
Your time is up.
Please gather in the hall.

547
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:09,656
I feel like they're quite similar
in many ways.

548
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,241
I'm curious what it'll be like.

549
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:15,036
-Yes, but it's a bit like fire and water.
-Yeah, right.

550
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,414
-So-hui is water, right?
-Yes, that's right.

551
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:19,458
Don't you really want to try that game?

552
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,251
Eun-yu, play it when you get home.

553
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:22,627
Sure, but Eun-yu,

554
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,296
there's prize money riding on this.

555
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:26,047
So you're playing it fully engaged…

556
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,008
Playing at home is different.

557
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:30,218
We thought we were dying.

558
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,387
When someone was eliminated,
it felt like they died.

559
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,722
That was what was surprising.

560
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,807
Of course we didn't die,
but it felt like we did.

561
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,142
I really felt like that.

562
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:42,230
The first game of the final match,
Big or Small, will now begin.

563
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:44,065
-It's starting.
-It's starting.

564
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,859
By virtue of having more Pieces,

565
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:51,364
Yoon So-hui shall choose
between contesting and betting in Round 1.

566
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:53,742
I will bet.

567
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,785
-Oh, betting.
-She's going to watch first.

568
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:59,789
Jeong Hyun-gyu
will be the contesting player,

569
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:04,044
and Yoon So-hui
will be the betting player in Round 1.

570
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:07,047
Round 1 will now begin.

571
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:10,008
Goodness. My throat is so dry.

572
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,053
Please draw a one.

573
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:14,846
If a difference in chips
opens up in Round 1,

574
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,223
it can really affect the momentum,

575
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:19,059
so I was praying
that the dealer would draw a one.

576
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:22,437
If the dealer plays a low card like a one,

577
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:28,360
the contesting player can play a high card
and earn a lot of chips in one go.

578
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:29,945
Here is the dealer's card.

579
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:31,154
One, one.

580
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:34,950
Three.

581
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:38,411
Jeong Hyun-gyu, please place
the card you wish to play face down.

582
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:41,706
I wasn't sure whether So-hui would try
and use reverse psychology

583
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,583
or go for an all-out attack when betting.

584
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,588
-She'll probably go for big, right?
-But it's a three.

585
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:51,174
-Isn't it too easy to predict?
-Yeah, this is too easy.

586
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:54,553
If Hyun-gyu wants to come out strong,
he could go for a one or two.

587
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:57,055
-As an unexpected play.
-If he thinks he might not win.

588
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:08,316
Yoon So-hui, please make your bet.

589
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,903
Yes, I will put two chips on small.

590
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,991
You have bet two chips on small.

591
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:18,910
She's gone for a twist on the play.

592
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:21,079
So-hui has nerves of steel.

593
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:25,125
I thought he'd play big to try
and get some chips right off the bat,

594
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:28,545
and I thought he would think
I would guess that and go for big,

595
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:30,755
so I went for small instead.

596
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,174
Jeong Hyun-gyu, please reveal your card.

597
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:35,635
Big.

598
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:38,221
Jeong Hyun-gyu, you have won the hand.

599
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:40,181
Here are your four chips.

600
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:44,269
First up, I decided to play big
to try and figure out So-hui's style.

601
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:47,772
So, I thought she'd think I'd think
she was going to go big and play small.

602
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:51,651
So I tried to use reverse,
reverse, reverse psychology.

603
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:54,904
So I played a hand to try
and secure a decent number of chips.

604
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:57,532
The contesting player for Round 2
is Yoon So-hui.

605
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,909
The betting player is Jeong Hyun-gyu.

606
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,578
Here is the dealer's card.

607
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:04,831
Mr. Choi's choice is also very important.

608
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:07,167
CHOI BYEONG-UN
DEALER

609
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:10,211
Yoon So-hui, please play a card.

610
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,630
-It's another seven.
-Is it a seven?

611
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:19,054
Since Hyun-gyu didn't do the unexpected,
I thought maybe I'd play a twist,

612
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,513
so I played a five.

613
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:23,266
Jeong Hyun-gyu, please make your bet.

614
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,353
She's just succumbed
to reverse psychology,

615
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:28,605
so I thought she'd go
for the opposite this time.

616
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,650
You have bet two chips on small.

617
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:35,153
Yoon So-hui, please reveal your card.

618
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:38,365
Small. Jeong Hyun-gyu,
your bet was successful.

619
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:40,200
-So-hui's off to a bad start.
-It's terrible.

620
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:41,284
It's an awful start.

621
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:43,912
The contesting player for Round 3
is Jeong Hyun-gyu.

622
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,373
The betting player is Yoon So-hui.

623
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:47,999
Here is the dealer's card.

624
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,461
Jeong Hyun-gyu, please play a card.

625
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,467
Yoon So-hui, please make your bet.

626
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:00,095
Shouldn't going small
be the obvious thing to do?

627
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:04,057
But after betting like that just now
and losing, she's probably torn.

628
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,266
So-hui must be confused

629
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,727
about whether or not
he's done the unexpected.

630
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,230
Darn.

631
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:12,899
You have bet two chips on small.

632
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:15,485
Jeong Hyun-gyu, please reveal your card.

633
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:17,904
It's a draw.

634
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:18,988
Darn it.

635
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:20,865
It's a six.

636
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:23,576
I guess he wanted to see
what So-hui would do.

637
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,619
That makes sense.

638
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,037
Well, given Hyun-gyu's style,

639
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:29,624
he must've thought that he should
get rid of six and seven early.

640
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:32,168
I think he's disregarding
the middle numbers.

641
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:34,170
He's decided
that the middle ones are useless.

642
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:36,798
Because my strategy was to
get rid of the numbers in the middle,

643
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:40,051
and because I didn't want to give her
any more chips, I played for the draw.

644
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,679
The contesting player for Round 4
is Yoon So-hui.

645
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:44,973
The betting player is Jeong Hyun-gyu.

646
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,349
So-hui looks nervous.

647
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,184
-Because things aren't working out.
-Yes.

648
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:50,270
Here is the dealer's card.

649
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:58,820
Jeong Hyun-gyu, please make your bet.

650
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:04,659
It would be really amazing
if he goes truly big on big.

651
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,247
You have bet three chips on big.

652
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:11,750
-He's gone for big.
-He reckons this is going to be a ten.

653
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:14,002
Yoon So-hui, please reveal your card.

654
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,464
It is a draw.

655
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:19,883
-Draw.
-I would've played a nine as well.

656
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,176
-Me too.
-Yes.

657
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,011
They're really quite similar.

658
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:24,846
So-hui had used
reverse psychology once already,

659
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:28,767
so I expected she might do it again
and bet on big.

660
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:32,437
I would have gained nothing by playing
something smaller than a nine,

661
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,899
and if he predicted that,
he would have got a lot of chips.

662
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:37,942
If I'd played a big card,
I'd get one chip,

663
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:41,404
but if he bet correctly,
he would have got more than that.

664
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,656
So I just played my nine for the draw.

665
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,159
The contesting player for Round 5
is Jeong Hyun-gyu.

666
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:47,952
The betting player is Yoon So-hui.

667
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,537
Here is the dealer's card.

668
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:54,250
Jeong Hyun-gyu, please play a card.

669
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:07,680
He went big just now, so…

670
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:14,062
You have bet two chips on small.

671
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:15,605
-She's gone for small.
-Well done.

672
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:17,982
Jeong Hyun-gyu, please reveal your card.

673
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:22,362
Small. Jeong Hyun-gyu,
you have lost the hand.

674
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:24,572
See, a one as I expected.
I thought he'd play low.

675
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:25,782
It was smart to play the one.

676
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:27,951
The dealer might play a one later,
so he's kept his zero.

677
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:30,537
Yoon So-hui, your bet was successful.

678
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,831
The contesting player for Round 6
is Yoon So-hui.

679
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:35,083
The betting player is Jeong Hyun-gyu.

680
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,043
Here is the dealer's card.

681
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:39,254
-It's a six.
-It'll be difficult for Hyun-gyu.

682
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,881
Yoon So-hui, please play a card.

683
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:48,847
Jeong Hyun-gyu, please make your bet.

684
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:00,984
Jeong Hyun-gyu,
you have bet three chips on small.

685
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:03,486
Yoon So-hui, please reveal your card.

686
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:07,574
Big.

687
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:08,658
See?

688
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,704
-Wow, what the heck?
-Now, Hyun-gyu will be rattled.

689
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:15,164
Has So-hui set a trap
and been lying in wait?

690
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:18,334
But now Hyun-gyu must know.
"So this is how she plays."

691
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:20,753
Yoon So-hui, you have won the hand.

692
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:22,672
Here are your four chips.

693
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:24,924
I never thought
So-hui would use her ten so soon.

694
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,676
Hang on, she has an eight.

695
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:29,178
So, Hyun-gyu never thought
she would play a ten.

696
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:31,180
That's why she played it and won big.

697
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:33,892
The contesting player for Round 7
is Jeong Hyun-gyu.

698
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:36,185
The betting player is Yoon So-hui.

699
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:37,770
Here is the dealer's card.

700
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:41,774
Jeong Hyun-gyu, please play a card.

701
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:43,693
He'll probably play a low card.

702
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:46,321
Because he already played high and high.

703
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,538
Yoon So-hui, please make your bet.

704
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,501
It's too obvious going for big here.

705
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:01,836
Hyun-gyu can't twist…

706
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,130
-Yes, Hyun-gyu can't.
-…so it's big.

707
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,675
You have bet two chips on big.

708
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:11,054
-Hyun-gyu can't do it. Not bad.
-So-hui knows it too.

709
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:13,806
Jeong Hyun-gyu, please reveal your card.

710
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:17,602
Small.

711
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:22,774
-Wow, he twisted here.
-Amazing.

712
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:25,276
Yoon So-hui, your bet has failed.

713
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,946
Was he trying to play it safe?

714
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:31,699
Because if he'd gone big and I bet big,
I'd get some chips too.

715
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:32,784
I see.

716
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,994
The contesting player for Round 8
is Yoon So-hui.

717
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:37,705
The betting player is Jeong Hyun-gyu.

718
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,290
Here is the dealer's card.

719
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:41,376
Yoon So-hui, please play a card.

720
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:42,460
I'm parched.

721
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:45,338
So-hui can only use her six or seven
if she's planning to play big.

722
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:48,132
-She has to save her eight.
-She has to save it.

723
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:56,808
Jeong Hyun-gyu, please make your bet.

724
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:12,073
You have bet two chips on big.

725
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:13,616
-What?
-What?

726
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,827
Yoon So-hui, please reveal your card.

727
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:17,704
Small.

728
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:20,999
Jeong Hyun-gyu, your bet has failed.

729
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:23,167
At this rate,
Hyun-gyu will be rattled too.

730
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:25,753
The contesting player for Round 9
is Jeong Hyun-gyu.

731
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:28,089
The betting player is Yoon So-hui.

732
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,882
Here is the dealer's card.

733
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:30,967
Is it a nine?

734
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:33,428
Goodness, this is too… Hey, this is a bit…

735
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,263
Do you think Hyun-gyu will play his ten?

736
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,185
Yoon So-hui, please make your bet.

737
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,566
-All in small all in?
-All in. All in on small.

738
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:48,818
Justin says he'd go all in on small.

739
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:51,070
Justin, you're eliminated again.

740
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:52,613
Again? Eliminated again?

741
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,699
-Me? Again?
-You've been eliminated again.

742
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:57,285
-Justin has been eliminated again.
-You're eliminated again.

743
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:58,745
A big bet on small?

744
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:01,414
You have bet two chips on small.

745
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:03,791
Jeong Hyun-gyu, please reveal your card.

746
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:06,919
It's a draw.

747
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:10,965
-It's a draw!
-I thought that might happen.

748
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,384
The contesting player for Round 10
is Yoon So-hui.

749
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:15,553
The betting player is Jeong Hyun-gyu.

750
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:17,221
Here is the dealer's card.

751
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,809
It's got to be big.

752
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:26,647
Jeong Hyun-gyu, please make your bet.

753
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:29,567
You have bet two chips on big.

754
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,819
Yoon So-hui, please reveal your card.

755
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:36,449
Big. Yoon So-hui, you have won the hand.

756
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:38,117
Here are your two chips.

757
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:41,829
Jeong Hyun-gyu, your bet was successful.
Here are your chips.

758
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:48,252
But I think it's better to bet
cautiously early on and go hard later.

759
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:49,337
That's the right thing to do.

760
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:52,381
Whoever uses their cards wisely
will win because of the betting.

761
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:55,176
The contesting player for Round 11
is Jeong Hyun-gyu.

762
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,220
The betting player is Yoon So-hui.

763
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:58,805
Here is the dealer's card.

764
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:01,265
Jeong Hyun-gyu, please play a card.

765
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:06,938
Yoon So-hui, please make your bet.

766
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,066
Doesn't she need to bet small here?

767
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:11,818
I don't think Hyun-gyu played his ten.

768
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:13,653
If he did,
that leaves him with no big cards.

769
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:17,240
You have bet two chips on small.

770
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:19,158
Right, that's rational.

771
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:21,494
Jeong Hyun-gyu, please reveal your card.

772
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,497
-Small.
-See?

773
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:27,208
-Hyun-gyu is straightforward.
-Hyun-gyu's style is straightforward.

774
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,918
I think he's not twisting it on purpose.

775
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:31,754
Yoon So-hui, your bet was successful.

776
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:34,674
The contesting player for Round 12
is Yoon So-hui.

777
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:37,176
The betting player is Jeong Hyun-gyu.

778
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,678
Here is the dealer's card.

779
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:39,929
-One?
-One?

780
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:41,639
Yikes, she still has her zero.

781
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:42,723
Right?

782
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:50,398
Jeong Hyun-gyu, please make your bet.

783
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,358
It's tense in there right now.

784
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:04,871
You have bet two chips on big.

785
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:09,083
Yoon So-hui, please reveal your card.

786
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:11,294
Small.

787
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:15,590
-She's a real gambler.
-But there's something about her.

788
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:17,550
-So-hui is playing well.
-Right.

789
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:19,760
So-hui is really calm.

790
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:22,638
I think she's figured out
that Hyun-gyu is trying to play it safe.

791
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:25,349
She'd know that because she's played
with him the whole time.

792
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:27,894
Jeong Hyun-gyu, your bet has failed.

793
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:32,398
The contesting player for Round 13
is Jeong Hyun-gyu.

794
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:34,442
The betting player is Yoon So-hui.

795
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:37,028
-Here is the dealer's card.
-Seven.

796
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:38,738
He played his seven earlier, so no draw.

797
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:41,199
Jeong Hyun-gyu, please play a card.

798
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,744
I'm screwed, damn it.

799
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:50,374
My handwriting really sucks. But I made
a mistake while counting So-hui's cards.

800
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:54,170
I thought, "Did I write them all wrong?
Did I get top and bottom confused?"

801
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,426
-Oh no, he's flummoxed.
-He smiled.

802
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:02,345
-There it is.
-He's facing a reality check.

803
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:03,930
Yes.

804
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:15,399
-Oh, no.
-He's panicking.

805
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,528
He's struggling with his calculations.

806
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:21,155
I think he missed a number earlier.

807
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,449
-He's lost track of a number.
-He's lost track of something.

808
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:24,867
-He's lost track of one.
-Yes.

809
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:35,294
Yoon So-hui, please make your bet.

810
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:39,048
But this…

811
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:42,009
What could it be?

812
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,679
Then if I do this…

813
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:47,974
-So-hui will probably go big, right?
-Gosh.

814
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:50,101
This format is really suffocating.

815
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:58,734
-She's gone for small.
-She only bet one.

816
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:01,654
She thinks it might be dangerous,
so she's gone for one.

817
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:04,448
Jeong Hyun-gyu, please reveal your card.

818
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:07,159
Big.

819
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:10,121
-I thought he'd go big here.
-You're right.

820
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:12,832
Jeong Hyun-gyu, you have won the hand.

821
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:14,625
Here are your three chips.

822
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:17,586
Yoon So-hui, your bet has failed.

823
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:20,506
The contesting player for Round 14
is Yoon So-hui.

824
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:22,675
The betting player is Jeong Hyun-gyu.

825
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:24,343
Here is the dealer's card.

826
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:26,679
Yoon So-hui, please play a card.

827
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:27,680
It's a three.

828
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:30,349
For a three, she's still got a hand.
She has a one as well.

829
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:32,226
This is confusing.

830
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:36,939
But as long as
the gap in chips doesn't get too big,

831
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:39,483
the right bet could turn the tables
at the end.

832
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:42,236
But the problem is
that since So-hui bet in Round 1,

833
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,738
Hyun-gyu bets on the last round.

834
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:50,661
Jeong Hyun-gyu, please make your bet.

835
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:56,208
-He's going.
-He's doing it.

836
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:57,918
You're playing so well.

837
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:00,755
Not a single error.

838
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:03,382
You have bet two chips on big.

839
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:05,634
Yoon So-hui, please reveal your card.

840
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:07,970
Small.

841
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:10,556
-Wow, that settles it.
-Oh, my God!

842
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,433
-Okay.
-Hyun-gyu's not on his game.

843
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:13,726
Oh, my God!

844
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:16,354
Jeong Hyun-gyu, your bet has failed.

845
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:18,022
This isn't easy.

846
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:23,611
At the time, I thought Hyun-gyu
would think I was going to go for big,

847
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:25,112
so I thought it was worth a punt.

848
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,114
That's why I played the one.

849
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,658
7high, from now on,
So-hui has no need to risk it, right?

850
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:32,286
Well, assuming they both know
what cards the other has,

851
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,789
-she has to hit him first and double up.
-Make sure he can't catch up.

852
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:36,791
And she has to keep
the difference in mind.

853
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:39,543
The contesting player for Round 15
is Jeong Hyun-gyu.

854
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:41,796
The betting player is Yoon So-hui.

855
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,506
Here is the dealer's card.

856
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:45,800
Jeong Hyun-gyu, please play a card.

857
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:48,010
-Hyun-gyu played his one.
-Yes.

858
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:49,678
Doesn't he have
middling numbers right now?

859
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:54,350
Hyun-gyu had a zero,
two, five and eight left,

860
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:57,353
and he couldn't afford to play the zero.

861
00:39:57,436 --> 00:40:00,689
I thought in that situation,
he'd probably go for the draw.

862
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,695
It was half and half,
since I had cards on both sides.

863
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:08,447
I had no idea what So-hui would do.

864
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:12,660
Wait a minute.

865
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:16,622
-He's torn.
-Hyun-gyu, you got this.

866
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:18,457
I've never seen Hyun-gyu like this before.

867
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:24,213
Yoon So-hui, please make your bet.

868
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:25,840
Isn't it better to bet 2?

869
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:27,842
So that the next turn…

870
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,985
You have bet two chips on big.

871
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:48,362
Jeong Hyun-gyu, please reveal your card.

872
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:51,115
It is a draw.

873
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:52,741
Pass. She gets them back.

874
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:55,536
It doesn't matter. It was the same
whether she bet two or ten.

875
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:58,664
The contesting player for Round 16
is Yoon So-hui.

876
00:40:58,747 --> 00:41:00,416
The betting player is Jeong Hyun-gyu.

877
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:02,001
Here is the dealer's card.

878
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:12,178
Hyun-gyu would've thought
I'd definitely go for big,

879
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:13,971
so I thought of playing small.

880
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:15,222
But then I thought,

881
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:18,142
it's important for me to gain chips
as well as it is for him to lose them.

882
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:29,278
Jeong Hyun-gyu, please make your bet.

883
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:34,867
This really isn't easy.

884
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:44,502
You have bet two chips on big.

885
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:46,962
Yoon So-hui, please reveal your card.

886
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,131
Big.

887
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:51,884
Yoon So-hui, you have won the hand.

888
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:53,594
I will give you two chips.

889
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:55,971
Jeong Hyun-gyu, your bet was successful.

890
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:58,682
-So-hui's been caught.
-I can't tell what you're doing.

891
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:00,893
I hope not.

892
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:03,562
This has gotten really serious.

893
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:06,732
The contesting player for Round 17
is Jeong Hyun-gyu.

894
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:08,609
The betting player is Yoon So-hui.

895
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:11,445
The dealer will play an eight in Round 18,

896
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:15,157
and So-hui has a three, seven and eight.

897
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:19,495
Since it is certain that she will play
her eight to get a draw,

898
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:24,250
Round 17 is effectively the last contest.

899
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,584
Here is the dealer's card.

900
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:28,045
-Is it a one?
-Goodness.

901
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:29,213
Does Hyun-gyu have a zero?

902
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:44,019
Yoon So-hui, please make your bet.

903
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:45,145
Go wild.

904
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:53,279
There was a risk in betting
if Hyun-gyu played a zero.

905
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:55,698
Since if I bet three, I would lose three,

906
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:59,785
I thought, "If I bet that much,
at least I won't lose."

907
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:07,209
This is for victory.

908
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:08,294
She's going.

909
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:13,632
You have bet three chips on big.

910
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:15,884
Jeong Hyun-gyu, please reveal your card.

911
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:19,847
Honestly…

912
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:23,642
Unbelievable. How could we
end up with a one-chip difference?

913
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:26,145
Big.

914
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:29,356
-This is why So-hui should've…
-Right.

915
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,649
She got her calculations wrong.

916
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,901
Right, that's why
she should've gone all in.

917
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:35,362
-It was wrong to bet three.
-She should have bet a lot.

918
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,823
-She should have bet more.
-Why didn't she go all in?

919
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:39,116
-Exactly.
-Exactly.

920
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:41,619
Jeong Hyun-gyu, you have won the hand.

921
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:42,953
Here are your seven chips.

922
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,582
Yoon So-hui, your bet was successful.

923
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:49,460
I kept thinking about how I might lose,

924
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:51,420
so I momentarily missed the fact

925
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:54,506
that Hyun-gyu could get seven
by playing his eight.

926
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:57,009
I really regret it so much.
I really don't know why I did that.

927
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:59,595
Even thinking about it now,
why did I do that?

928
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:04,350
The contesting player for Round 18
is Yoon So-hui.

929
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:06,810
The betting player is Jeong Hyun-gyu.

930
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:08,562
Here is the dealer's card.

931
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:12,816
Jeong Hyun-gyu, please make your bet.

932
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,737
-All in. He's going to go all in.
-All in?

933
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:17,821
But it's a draw.

934
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:19,615
-What now?
-Don't lose heart.

935
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:21,408
Her expression shows it's a draw.

936
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:25,746
Why did you do that?

937
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:27,915
I messed up. Right at the end.

938
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:35,172
That was so hard.

939
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:37,675
I messed up my calculations.

940
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:40,135
Yoon So-hui, please reveal your card.

941
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:43,722
It's a draw.

942
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:50,020
That concludes Round 18.

943
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:55,776
Jeong Hyun-gyu ends with 21 chips
and Yoon So-hui with 20.

944
00:44:56,819 --> 00:45:00,864
Jeong Hyun-gyu has won
the first game of the final match.

945
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:04,576
The second game of the final match
will begin soon.

946
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,954
Of all the games
I played so far at The Devil's Plan,

947
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:08,747
that was the most intense, most difficult,

948
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:11,166
and the one I felt
I came closest to losing.

949
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:14,336
Somehow, after losing,
I feel even more determined to win.

950
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:19,299
So, I'm going to smash the second game
and do my best in the third as well.

951
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:22,761
Let me introduce the second game.

952
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:26,140
The second game of the final match is

953
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:27,599
Bagh Chal.

954
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:30,811
Bagh Chal is an abstract strategy game

955
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:32,271
from ancient Nepal.

956
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:37,401
The tigers must catch the goats
while the goats try to pen in the tigers.

957
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:39,611
-What's this?
-This really looks like fun.

958
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:43,699
There are four tiger counters
and twenty goat counters.

959
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:46,243
The game starts

960
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:50,873
with the four tiger counters positioned
on the four corners of the board.

961
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:52,332
When the game starts,

962
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:57,212
the player playing as the goat
has 90 seconds to place a goat counter

963
00:45:57,296 --> 00:46:00,549
on one of the empty spaces on the board.

964
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:03,969
After all 20 goats have been placed,

965
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:07,139
the goat player moves
one of the goat counters

966
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:09,683
one space along the lines
marked on the board.

967
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:11,769
On the tiger player's turn,

968
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:17,608
they must either move one of
their counters or capture a goat.

969
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:19,193
Looks a bit like Nine Men's Morris.

970
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:23,530
The tiger counter can be moved one space
along the lines marked on the board.

971
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:28,118
If there is a goat next to a tiger
with an empty space on the other side,

972
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:32,998
the tiger can capture the goat by
leaping over it and into the empty space.

973
00:46:33,081 --> 00:46:37,127
When that happens, the goat counter
is removed from the board.

974
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:40,255
There are two ways for the game to end.

975
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:43,926
First, if the tiger captures five goats,

976
00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:47,721
the game ends in victory
for the tiger player.

977
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:52,434
Second, if none of the tiger counters
can no longer move,

978
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:56,021
the game ends in victory
for the goat player.

979
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:57,898
It's more difficult to play as goats.

980
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:01,902
This game will be played
simultaneously on two boards.

981
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:03,237
-That's difficult.
-There are two?

982
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,655
-At the same time?
-Right.

983
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:07,574
The two players will stand
facing each other

984
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:11,328
and shall play goats
on the board to their left,

985
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:15,249
and tigers on the board to their right
simultaneously.

986
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:19,545
The player with more Pieces
will decide who goes first,

987
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:22,214
and the game shall begin
with each player taking a turn

988
00:47:22,297 --> 00:47:25,259
moving their respective counters
on the board

989
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:28,303
on which the player going first
is playing goats.

990
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:32,599
Next, the players will make
two moves on the board on which

991
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:36,228
the player going second is playing goats.

992
00:47:36,311 --> 00:47:39,231
Thereafter, the players will switch
from board to board

993
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:41,316
playing two turns at a time.

994
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:46,113
If one of the matches ends,

995
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:49,825
the game will end in victory
for whichever player wins the match.

996
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:52,077
Whoever wins first wins overall.

997
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:56,456
You may both select
one of the players in the living area

998
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:59,126
to practice with for 30 minutes.

999
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:04,256
-They're going to practice.
-They get to practice.

1000
00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:08,302
Yoon So-hui, please choose
who you would like to practice with.

1001
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:09,887
-Definitely Se-dol, right?
-Exactly.

1002
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:12,472
-No, I don't play that.
-It's got to be Se-dol for sure.

1003
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:13,599
It must be the GOAT, Se-dol.

1004
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:15,142
I will…

1005
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:17,269
choose Kyuhyun.

1006
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:18,395
-Me?
-Oh, good!

1007
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:20,814
-Not me!
-Goodness.

1008
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:24,359
I chose Kyuhyun because
when we were in the living area,

1009
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:26,445
we played Wall Go a few times,

1010
00:48:26,528 --> 00:48:29,197
and I felt like he had
a good understanding of the game

1011
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:31,199
and was good at making strategies.

1012
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:32,618
I will choose Tinno.

1013
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:36,997
Since it's a board game,
Tinno would probably be quite good.

1014
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,666
-What am I supposed to do about this?
-Do your best.

1015
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:42,044
-I'll… Yes, mind.
-Mental.

1016
00:48:42,127 --> 00:48:44,171
-Help as much as you can.
-Good luck.

1017
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:47,132
-Kyuhyun, help her prepare mentally, okay?
-Okay.

1018
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:51,470
Kyuhyun, Tinno, please make your way
to the game area.

1019
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:54,348
Wow, I can't believe
we're back here like this.

1020
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:55,682
-So-hui.
-Yes?

1021
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:58,310
-Why did you choose me, not Se-dol?
-Exactly.

1022
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:01,897
-Damn.
-What do you mean, "damn"?

1023
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,441
Se-dol, do you think if you played this,

1024
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:06,568
you'd have a good understanding of it?

1025
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:10,322
-Se-dol always says things like that.
-Hey, hey.

1026
00:49:10,405 --> 00:49:11,406
He's smiling.

1027
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:13,909
Let's do this.

1028
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:17,746
It might be confusing
playing two games at the same time.

1029
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:20,123
Do I have to play goats here
and then tigers here?

1030
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:21,959
Yeah. I think that might be confusing.

1031
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:24,962
First up, I'll put a goat in the middle.
You play tigers.

1032
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:26,713
-You've moved forward.
-You have to block.

1033
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:28,757
So I'll put one in behind,
since they can jump.

1034
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:31,134
-This has to come from both sides.
-Right.

1035
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:34,972
When playing goats, you don't
want to be attacked simultaneously.

1036
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:38,016
-The game ends if I capture five goats?
-Yes.

1037
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,352
-I'll try something a bit risky.
-Okay.

1038
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:42,521
I'm curious what happens
if I put this in the middle.

1039
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:46,608
That doesn't seem risky.
I think that's a smart move.

1040
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:47,818
If you can lead your opponent on,

1041
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:49,736
you can make it so
the tigers can't do anything.

1042
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:53,365
-Hyun-gyu will realize that too.
-It's not easy playing against Hyun-gyu.

1043
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:55,701
One strategy could be to play quickly.
To pressure your opponent.

1044
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:58,870
-Your time is up.
-Already?

1045
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:03,000
Kyuhyun, Tinno,
please return to the living area.

1046
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:04,918
-I'll do my best.
-Good luck.

1047
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:08,088
-I'll try not to make any mistakes.
-As I always say, watch out for mistakes.

1048
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:10,132
-I know.
-Take another look. Don't be in a rush.

1049
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:14,594
If So-hui loses again,
it's all over for her.

1050
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:19,725
So if I try to end it quickly,
she's bound to make a mistake.

1051
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:21,309
That's what I'm aiming for.

1052
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:26,064
The second game of the final match,
Bagh Chal, will now begin.

1053
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:28,358
I'm so nervous.

1054
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:31,445
The player going first will play goats.

1055
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:33,113
By virtue of having more Pieces,

1056
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:37,325
Yoon So-hui shall decide
who will go first.

1057
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:39,369
I will go first.

1058
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:41,830
Going first means playing goats first.

1059
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:44,332
I think the position of
the goats is important.

1060
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:45,417
Shake.

1061
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:48,587
-Good luck.
-I have to do well.

1062
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:50,338
Good luck, So-hui.

1063
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:51,840
Good luck, Hyun-gyu.

1064
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:55,635
Yoon So-hui, please place a goat counter.

1065
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:56,720
Okay.

1066
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:01,308
Where is a good place to put the goats?

1067
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:05,645
If you do this,
he will come out to block it.

1068
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:06,855
Then that's done for.

1069
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:09,399
When you're a goat, it seems better
not to start in the middle.

1070
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:10,317
Right.

1071
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,110
Because it can come for him like this,

1072
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:15,238
so I think it's better
to start off on the side.

1073
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:16,531
-I'll put it here.
-Okay.

1074
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:19,242
Good. Right. Then one should go here.

1075
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:21,411
-Put it here.
-Then they're invincible.

1076
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:23,330
-For now.
-I definitely have to start here.

1077
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:25,332
Right, stick to the line.

1078
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:27,626
That's a good move.
Moves around the corner are good.

1079
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:30,170
-Yes.
-I think it'll be great to go here first.

1080
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:37,844
Jeong Hyun-gyu, you have 90 seconds
to move one of your tiger counters.

1081
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:39,763
I'll be quick as a flash.

1082
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:41,932
Did you do that when you were practicing?

1083
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:44,476
Yes, we went for a side start.
Exactly the same.

1084
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:45,811
Please come over to this table.

1085
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:49,356
Jeong Hyun-gyu,
please place a goat counter.

1086
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:53,485
Yoon So-hui,
please move one of your tiger counters.

1087
00:51:58,156 --> 00:51:59,366
She's going on the diagonal.

1088
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:02,077
Jeong Hyun-gyu,
please place a goat counter.

1089
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:07,457
Yoon So-hui,
please move one of your tiger counters.

1090
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:13,588
If you fill the corners and sides,
you're safe.

1091
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:16,424
Yoon So-hui, please place a goat counter.

1092
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:22,097
Jeong Hyun-gyu,
please move one of your tiger counters.

1093
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:26,393
Yoon So-hui, please place a goat counter.

1094
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:30,939
Jeong Hyun-gyu,
please move one of your tiger counters.

1095
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:34,609
The tigers can't do anything.
I feel so sorry for the tigers.

1096
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,486
Tiger!

1097
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:41,908
Jeong Hyun-gyu,
please place a goat counter.

1098
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:46,746
Yoon So-hui,
please move one of your tiger counters.

1099
00:52:47,455 --> 00:52:49,082
It is Jeong Hyun-gyu's turn.

1100
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:50,542
It is now Yoon So-hui's turn.

1101
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:53,628
Jeong Hyun-gyu,
please move one of your tiger counters.

1102
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:55,922
Right, there's nothing the tigers can do.
Poor things.

1103
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:58,383
You're really empathizing with the tigers.

1104
00:52:58,466 --> 00:52:59,843
The tigers have to move smart.

1105
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:04,306
Yoon So-hui, please place a goat counter.

1106
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:08,810
Jeong Hyun-gyu,
please move one of your tiger counters.

1107
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:11,980
Jeong Hyun-gyu,
please place a goat counter.

1108
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:14,316
Yoon So-hui,
please move one of your tiger counters.

1109
00:53:14,399 --> 00:53:17,152
-The tigers here look pitiful too.
-Honestly, Kyuhyun.

1110
00:53:17,235 --> 00:53:18,904
I was a tiger in our last practice game.

1111
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:21,323
Yoon So-hui, you have 30 seconds left.

1112
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:30,081
Yoon So-hui, please place a goat counter.

1113
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:36,338
Jeong Hyun-gyu,
please move one of your tiger counters.

1114
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:38,882
Yoon So-hui, please place a goat counter.

1115
00:53:43,094 --> 00:53:46,598
I feel like it's important
not to yield the corners.

1116
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:48,350
You're talking about like this?

1117
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:51,144
If the corners are blocked,
they'll be trapped.

1118
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:53,688
Let me try a strategy
where we move all the tigers out.

1119
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:54,606
Okay.

1120
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:59,236
Good. If you do that,
there's no good move for me.

1121
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:03,114
Hey, So-hui. The right. Why?

1122
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:05,825
-She'll go to the corner.
-Yes, that's it. Right.

1123
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:08,203
-So-hui's pretty good at this.
-She's good.

1124
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:10,247
Once she understands the rules,
she's good.

1125
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:11,998
But understanding the rules…

1126
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:13,583
-Is she quick?
-Not at all.

1127
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:16,878
-She's not that quick?
-But once she understands, she's great.

1128
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:22,300
As expected, So-hui picked up
on the main point of this game,

1129
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:24,886
but there was one point where we differed.

1130
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:26,680
So-hui was filling up the corners,

1131
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:29,391
whereas I thought
it was better to save them

1132
00:54:29,474 --> 00:54:31,559
since goats could go there at any time.

1133
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:35,313
I think it's a huge advantage for Hyun-gyu
to leave the corners open,

1134
00:54:35,397 --> 00:54:37,107
I think that's a good strategy.

1135
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:39,985
Jeong Hyun-gyu,
please move one of your tiger counters.

1136
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:44,823
Jeong Hyun-gyu,
please place a goat counter.

1137
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:50,662
Yoon So-hui,
please move one of your tiger counters.

1138
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:04,676
Please place a goat counter.

1139
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:07,387
Please move one of your tiger counters.

1140
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:11,474
Yoon So-hui, please place a goat counter.

1141
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,519
It's confusing going back and forth.

1142
00:55:14,602 --> 00:55:16,896
-Whoever makes the first mistake…
-Yes. Me too.

1143
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,315
So I think part of the game

1144
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:20,525
is coping with two tables.

1145
00:55:20,608 --> 00:55:22,527
The moment one of them makes a mistake…

1146
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:24,321
If you lose it, you make a mistake.

1147
00:55:25,238 --> 00:55:27,949
-Jeong Hyun-gyu.
-We're going to fill up all the sides.

1148
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:28,908
I think so.

1149
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:31,536
Yoon So-hui, please place a goat counter.

1150
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:33,621
Tinno, once the sides are full,

1151
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:35,790
-there's nothing the tigers can do.
-Right.

1152
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:37,375
I thought it was advantageous to go first.

1153
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:40,754
I guess when there's only
one space left and the board is full,

1154
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:44,799
it seems like it will be impossible
for the tigers to capture a goat.

1155
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:48,219
Jeong Hyun-gyu.

1156
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:51,514
It is Jeong Hyun-gyu's turn.

1157
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:53,141
Please place a goat counter.

1158
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:59,397
Yoon So-hui,
please move one of your tiger counters.

1159
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:04,277
Is So-hui feeling sick again?

1160
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:06,446
-I guess she's feeling the stress.
-Oh, no.

1161
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:08,531
When you get stressed, your stomach…

1162
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:11,076
I guess she feels it
as soon as she gets stressed.

1163
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:11,993
Right.

1164
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:14,954
Yoon So-hui, please move
one of your tiger counters.

1165
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:23,296
Jeong Hyun-gyu,
please place a goat counter.

1166
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,965
Yoon So-hui,
please move one of your tiger counters.

1167
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:32,806
Yoon So-hui, please place a goat counter.

1168
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:38,353
Jeong Hyun-gyu,
please move one of your tiger counters.

1169
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:41,731
Yoon So-hui.

1170
00:56:46,277 --> 00:56:49,155
Jeong Hyun-gyu,
please place a goat counter.

1171
00:56:56,871 --> 00:56:59,958
Yoon So-hui,
please move one of your tiger counters.

1172
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:08,967
-He's finished.
-You're right.

1173
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:11,594
-If Hyun-gyu puts his piece there…
-If he does that, it's over.

1174
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:13,763
-If he puts it here, she can block it.
-It's done.

1175
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:17,016
Jeong Hyun-gyu,
please place a goat counter.

1176
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:22,105
I've made a mistake.

1177
00:57:23,064 --> 00:57:24,816
I thought it'd be over
if I took the middle.

1178
00:57:24,899 --> 00:57:26,276
If you occupy the middle,

1179
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:29,487
the tigers can go back and forth
and end up dying.

1180
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:30,697
I've made a mistake.

1181
00:57:31,906 --> 00:57:32,907
Okay.

1182
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:38,329
Yoon So-hui,
please move one of your tiger counters.

1183
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:42,542
Yoon So-hui has captured a goat.

1184
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,920
I was waiting for him to make a mistake.

1185
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:48,798
I thought that once he made a mistake,

1186
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:51,217
it wouldn't take long
for it all to fall apart.

1187
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:54,679
So I was watching him
and willing him to make a mistake.

1188
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:59,559
Yoon So-hui, please place a goat counter.

1189
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:06,107
-So-hui is doing well by playing it safe.
-Exactly.

1190
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:07,984
There's really nothing the tigers can do.

1191
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:10,653
Jeong Hyun-gyu,
please move one of your tiger counters.

1192
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:13,406
Yoon So-hui, please place a goat counter.

1193
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:16,034
-Doesn't So-hui's line look really solid?
-The top is very solid.

1194
00:58:16,117 --> 00:58:18,244
She's building up at the top
and working her way down.

1195
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:21,080
Jeong Hyun-gyu, please move
one of your tiger counters.

1196
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:27,670
Jeong Hyun-gyu,
please place a goat counter.

1197
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:29,881
He has to think of a way
to firm up his line.

1198
00:58:29,964 --> 00:58:32,091
Exactly, but I don't think
he's trying to fill in the gaps.

1199
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:33,718
You have 30 seconds left.

1200
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:37,764
Once you lose one,
it seems like there's no end to it.

1201
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:39,682
Once you lose one,
you just keep collapsing.

1202
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:44,521
Seven, six, five, four…

1203
00:58:47,815 --> 00:58:49,484
But he can't put that there.

1204
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:52,654
-I think he's toast. He's totally toast.
-If he goes there. Exactly.

1205
00:58:52,737 --> 00:58:57,242
So-hui likes to play it safe,
and I'm a bit more adventurous.

1206
00:58:57,325 --> 00:58:59,244
I had no choice but to sacrifice a goat.

1207
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:04,457
So when So-hui took my goat, I thought
I might be able to trap three tigers.

1208
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:07,460
Yoon So-hui,
please move one of your tiger counters.

1209
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:10,880
Yoon So-hui has captured a goat.

1210
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:15,510
Jeong Hyun-gyu,
please place a goat counter.

1211
00:59:15,593 --> 00:59:18,096
Yoon So-hui,
please move one of your tiger counters.

1212
00:59:18,179 --> 00:59:19,764
She must be wary of getting penned in.

1213
00:59:19,847 --> 00:59:20,765
Yeah.

1214
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:23,101
Oh, no.

1215
00:59:31,693 --> 00:59:33,695
I should have filled in the sides.

1216
00:59:33,778 --> 00:59:36,573
Yoon So-hui, please place a goat counter.

1217
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:41,035
Jeong Hyun-gyu,
please move one of your tiger counters.

1218
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:43,121
He needs to get his tiger out of the way.

1219
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:45,039
He needs to move that tiger in the corner.

1220
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:46,666
If she fills the space with a goat…

1221
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:54,257
Jeong Hyun-gyu,
please place a goat counter.

1222
00:59:55,174 --> 00:59:57,635
So, when you're playing a game
you're unfamiliar with,

1223
00:59:57,719 --> 00:59:59,512
it's best to play it safe.

1224
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:01,306
She's just sticking to the basics.

1225
01:00:02,223 --> 01:00:05,518
So-hui played it so safe,
and I took a bit of a risk,

1226
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:07,645
but since neither of us
really understood the game,

1227
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:11,858
it would have been better to play it safe,
but I tried something.

1228
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:16,154
It's Yoon So-hui's turn.
Please move one of your tiger counters.

1229
01:00:19,365 --> 01:00:21,576
Why not take the one down below?
There's one down there.

1230
01:00:21,659 --> 01:00:24,162
-It doesn't matter if she does that.
-She can leap over it now.

1231
01:00:24,245 --> 01:00:26,956
-She can just jump over it now.
-So-hui, look! Please check carefully.

1232
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:32,211
Yoon So-hui, please move
one of your tiger counters.

1233
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:36,799
Yoon So-hui has captured a goat.

1234
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:37,717
I'd better take this.

1235
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,011
Yoon So-hui, please place a goat counter.

1236
01:00:40,094 --> 01:00:40,928
This is over.

1237
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:43,681
-She'll get another one on her next turn.
-Yeah, this is game over.

1238
01:00:43,765 --> 01:00:44,766
-This one is captured.
-Yes.

1239
01:00:44,849 --> 01:00:47,727
You're right. He can't defend it.
So that one is going to get taken.

1240
01:00:48,936 --> 01:00:50,063
Jeong Hyun-gyu.

1241
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:53,191
Yoon So-hui.

1242
01:00:54,692 --> 01:00:57,445
Jeong Hyun-gyu,
please place a goat counter.

1243
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:08,164
Yoon So-hui,
please move one of your tiger counters.

1244
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:13,503
Yoon So-hui has captured a goat.

1245
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:18,341
-He can't defend from here. He can't.
-He can't stop it.

1246
01:01:18,424 --> 01:01:20,218
It's overwhelming this time.

1247
01:01:20,301 --> 01:01:21,302
I'm screwed.

1248
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:28,685
I thought I could play my counters
to shepherd the tigers,

1249
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:30,978
but my judgment was clouded
when I made a risky move,

1250
01:01:31,062 --> 01:01:32,480
and I made a huge mistake.

1251
01:01:37,902 --> 01:01:40,446
Yoon So-hui,
please move one of your tiger counters.

1252
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:48,371
Yoon So-hui's tigers have now captured
five of Jeong Hyun-gyu's goats.

1253
01:01:48,454 --> 01:01:49,956
I shouldn't have lost even one.

1254
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:54,043
Yoon So-hui has won
the second game of the final match.

1255
01:01:58,131 --> 01:01:59,841
-You did great.
-GG.

1256
01:01:59,924 --> 01:02:03,928
The third game of the final match
will begin soon.

1257
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:06,723
I'm glad it finished a lot quicker
than I was expecting.

1258
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:09,600
And since I won the second game,
I now get to play a decider.

1259
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:13,396
Well, So-hui made a mistake, and so did I.
Now it's even.

1260
01:02:15,314 --> 01:02:17,692
-I'm tired.
-Me too.

1261
01:02:17,775 --> 01:02:19,110
You must be feeling worse.

1262
01:02:19,193 --> 01:02:22,363
No, you looked like
you were having a rough time too.

1263
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:25,450
Here is the third game of the final match.

1264
01:02:25,533 --> 01:02:28,035
The third game of the final match is

1265
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:29,912
Question and Truth.

1266
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:31,372
You figure out by asking questions.

1267
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:34,584
Question and Truth is a game
where you must ask pertinent questions

1268
01:02:34,667 --> 01:02:37,920
to ascertain the order
of your opponent's cards.

1269
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:39,130
At the start of the game,

1270
01:02:39,213 --> 01:02:43,718
each player will
be given a deck of cards and ten tokens.

1271
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:49,307
When the game starts, each player
selects eight cards from their deck

1272
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:54,145
and arrange them in the spaces
at their rostrum.

1273
01:02:54,228 --> 01:02:55,772
When arranging your cards,

1274
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:58,441
you must ensure
that cards of the same suit

1275
01:02:58,524 --> 01:03:00,943
are arranged lowest to highest
from left to right.

1276
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:05,823
It is not necessary
to place them next to each other,

1277
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:09,869
nor do they need to be in numerical order
with cards of other suits.

1278
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:11,788
They have to be
in numerical order within the suit.

1279
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:15,166
For the purpose of this,
aces shall be considered face cards,

1280
01:03:15,249 --> 01:03:17,919
and face cards, namely the ace,
jack, queen, and king,

1281
01:03:18,002 --> 01:03:21,631
shall be assigned values
of 1, 11, 12, and 13 respectively.

1282
01:03:21,714 --> 01:03:25,468
For example,
when arranging this hand of cards,

1283
01:03:25,551 --> 01:03:29,680
cards of the same suit
such as the ace, five and six of clubs

1284
01:03:29,764 --> 01:03:32,433
should be arranged in ascending order.

1285
01:03:32,517 --> 01:03:36,854
The seven, five and king of diamonds
are currently not in ascending order,

1286
01:03:36,938 --> 01:03:40,525
and must be rearranged
as five, seven, king.

1287
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:45,404
The rounds shall begin when both players
have finished arranging their cards.

1288
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:51,494
First, both players shall take
their ten tokens and submit some of them.

1289
01:03:51,994 --> 01:03:55,665
Players have up to 30 seconds
to decide how many tokens to submit,

1290
01:03:55,748 --> 01:03:58,626
and the number of tokens submitted
is not revealed.

1291
01:03:58,709 --> 01:04:02,380
At this time,
if a player has five tokens or less,

1292
01:04:02,463 --> 01:04:04,924
a warning light will come on.

1293
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:07,844
If both players submit
the same number of tokens,

1294
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:10,471
the dealer will take the submitted tokens,

1295
01:04:10,555 --> 01:04:15,685
and the players will receive two tokens
and then resubmit.

1296
01:04:15,768 --> 01:04:19,730
Whichever player submits more tokens

1297
01:04:19,814 --> 01:04:23,985
shall have the opportunity
to ask a question or state the truth.

1298
01:04:24,902 --> 01:04:26,571
If they choose to ask a question,

1299
01:04:26,654 --> 01:04:31,826
they must choose one of a list
of 11 questions to ask their opponent.

1300
01:04:31,909 --> 01:04:34,370
The list consists of questions
that may be used

1301
01:04:34,453 --> 01:04:37,582
to deduce the order
of your opponents cards,

1302
01:04:37,665 --> 01:04:40,668
and the same question
may be asked more than once.

1303
01:04:40,751 --> 01:04:42,879
-You can only ask certain things.
-This is amazing.

1304
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:46,007
The player being asked the question
must answer truthfully,

1305
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:48,885
and once they have given their answer,
the round ends.

1306
01:04:48,968 --> 01:04:51,804
The next round begins
with both players submitting tokens again.

1307
01:04:52,597 --> 01:04:53,973
If the player chooses truth,

1308
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:56,809
they must guess
the order of their opponent's cards.

1309
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:59,645
They make their guess
by stating the numbers

1310
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:02,732
and letters of their opponent's cards
in order.

1311
01:05:02,815 --> 01:05:05,484
For the purpose of guessing,
suits are irrelevant.

1312
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:10,364
If the player's guess is correct,

1313
01:05:10,448 --> 01:05:13,576
it will end in victory for that player.

1314
01:05:13,659 --> 01:05:18,831
If their guess is wrong, players
shall submit tokens to begin a new round.

1315
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:20,666
Each time they submit tokens,

1316
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:24,003
each player shall be given
an additional two tokens.

1317
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:27,506
When the number of tokens held
by a player whose warning light is on

1318
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:31,636
goes back above five,
the warning light will switch off.

1319
01:05:31,719 --> 01:05:35,181
The game will continue
until one player correctly guesses

1320
01:05:35,264 --> 01:05:39,060
the order of their opponent's cards,

1321
01:05:39,143 --> 01:05:44,523
and the winner of this game will be
the final winner of The Devil's Plan.

1322
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:49,028
The third game of the final match
will begin soon.

1323
01:05:49,111 --> 01:05:51,447
They must be nervous. Good luck!

1324
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:52,949
Guess eight cards and it's over.

1325
01:05:53,032 --> 01:05:55,493
Don't need to know the suit,
just the numbers.

1326
01:05:55,576 --> 01:05:57,119
The questions are important.

1327
01:05:57,203 --> 01:05:58,746
So, how are we going to join forces?

1328
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:01,749
-Are we going to play here?
-How shall we do this?

1329
01:06:01,832 --> 01:06:03,125
Ji-yeong, do you trust me?

1330
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:05,044
Shall I trust you? For the fourth time?

1331
01:06:05,544 --> 01:06:07,922
So, can you arrange your cards
however you like?

1332
01:06:08,005 --> 01:06:09,757
-You pick your own cards.
-You choose what you want.

1333
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:11,550
It's not random.
You get to choose yourself?

1334
01:06:11,634 --> 01:06:14,679
But I think making the deck itself
is a battle of minds.

1335
01:06:14,762 --> 01:06:17,014
-There is that. You're right.
-That's the point.

1336
01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:18,599
You have to make it last long.

1337
01:06:18,683 --> 01:06:19,892
Something confusing.

1338
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:21,435
Guessing right is not all.

1339
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:23,396
Right, even if you know, if you can't…

1340
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:25,022
You have to bid well.

1341
01:06:25,106 --> 01:06:29,610
You have to
keep the warning light on or off.

1342
01:06:29,694 --> 01:06:32,905
If the warning light
keeps going on and off, it's too obvious.

1343
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:35,074
This last game feels
like a mixed martial arts fight.

1344
01:06:35,157 --> 01:06:37,410
-Really?
-The betting is going to be so important.

1345
01:06:38,911 --> 01:06:41,956
Since the red light comes on
when we get down to five tokens,

1346
01:06:42,039 --> 01:06:45,251
I'm planning to save my tokens
so I never get that low.

1347
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:47,920
By doing that, I think
I'll be able to bid with certainty.

1348
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:51,465
And since the winner of The Devil's Plan
will be decided with this,

1349
01:06:51,549 --> 01:06:53,259
I'm going to give it my all.

1350
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:56,429
I'm more confident
with deduction than betting.

1351
01:06:56,512 --> 01:06:59,306
I think the questions regarding position
are going to be most useful.

1352
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:01,642
Since cards will be in ascending order,

1353
01:07:01,726 --> 01:07:03,811
I think that will make it easy
to find them.

1354
01:07:03,894 --> 01:07:06,022
I think I need to find out
their position first.

1355
01:07:06,105 --> 01:07:08,107
Your time is up.

1356
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:10,484
Please gather in the hall.

1357
01:07:23,164 --> 01:07:24,623
Poor So-hui.

1358
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:26,917
-Are you sure So-hui is okay?
-I know.

1359
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:29,879
-Her stomach must be turning.
-She looks pretty beat up.

1360
01:07:29,962 --> 01:07:31,881
I guess these seven days
have been tough on her.

1361
01:07:34,633 --> 01:07:37,011
The pain doesn't seem to be going away,

1362
01:07:37,094 --> 01:07:40,973
but I want to do my best to win.

1363
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:42,016
I…

1364
01:07:44,226 --> 01:07:46,103
I'm going to give it my best shot.

1365
01:07:46,687 --> 01:07:50,441
Currently, Yoon So-hui and Jeong Hyun-gyu
have won one game each.

1366
01:07:50,524 --> 01:07:55,905
The winner of this game shall be
the final winner of The Devil's Plan.

1367
01:07:55,988 --> 01:07:57,364
-Let's do this!
-Good luck!

1368
01:07:57,448 --> 01:08:03,370
The third game of the final match,
Question and Truth, will now begin.

1369
01:08:03,454 --> 01:08:05,372
Please begin to assign your cards.

1370
01:08:18,844 --> 01:08:21,430
You know, setting your cards out
takes skill too.

1371
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:23,766
-Yes. You're right.
-Determining which order to put them in.

1372
01:08:23,849 --> 01:08:25,309
You can't make it too obvious.

1373
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:29,939
To be honest,
the face cards have such high values

1374
01:08:30,022 --> 01:08:32,983
that I thought if he asked something
like the sum of my face cards,

1375
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:38,114
it might be too easy to deduce my cards,
so I tried not to pick too many of them.

1376
01:08:39,031 --> 01:08:42,118
Asking about consecutive numbers
is the strongest.

1377
01:08:42,201 --> 01:08:44,995
So, I tried to arrange them
so whichever numbers she chose,

1378
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:46,539
they were evenly distributed.

1379
01:08:49,416 --> 01:08:50,751
There's no luck involved in this.

1380
01:08:50,835 --> 01:08:52,253
-Right, no luck involved.
-You're right.

1381
01:08:52,336 --> 01:08:53,546
That makes it more difficult.

1382
01:08:53,629 --> 01:08:55,840
The number of questions to be asked
is determined by your skill.

1383
01:08:55,923 --> 01:08:56,924
Right.

1384
01:08:58,551 --> 01:09:00,553
Have you both
finished arranging your cards?

1385
01:09:00,636 --> 01:09:01,887
-Yes.
-Yes.

1386
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:03,889
Wow, I wonder how they made their cards.

1387
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:05,766
I hope they both make a good fist of it.

1388
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:06,851
With no regrets.

1389
01:09:06,934 --> 01:09:08,978
Round 1 will now begin.

1390
01:09:09,061 --> 01:09:11,480
Both players, please submit your tokens.

1391
01:09:19,655 --> 01:09:21,031
Two or three?

1392
01:09:22,741 --> 01:09:25,035
Since we only get
two additional tokens per round,

1393
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:26,954
I decided to bet two first up,

1394
01:09:27,037 --> 01:09:29,707
and by seeing whether
I got to ask a question or not,

1395
01:09:29,790 --> 01:09:32,710
determine how many Hyun-gyu was betting…

1396
01:09:32,793 --> 01:09:37,923
Five, four, three, two, one.

1397
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:39,800
All tokens have been submitted.

1398
01:09:39,884 --> 01:09:44,096
Yoon So-hui, please choose whether
to ask a question or state a truth.

1399
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:45,514
Question, please.

1400
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:47,099
You have chosen question.

1401
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:49,185
Yoon So-hui, please ask your question.

1402
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:55,065
I will ask which positions are occupied
by consecutive numbers or face cards.

1403
01:09:58,277 --> 01:09:59,612
You're not allowed to bluff.

1404
01:09:59,695 --> 01:10:01,197
Of course not!

1405
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,741
-The first thing you think about is lying.
-Then the game would never end.

1406
01:10:03,824 --> 01:10:05,117
It's called Question and Truth.

1407
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:07,536
You're just a natural-born liar.

1408
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:10,789
Second and seventh.

1409
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:12,124
-Two, seven.
-Two, seven?

1410
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:14,585
-So, he only has two consecutive cards.
-Only two and seven?

1411
01:10:14,668 --> 01:10:16,587
We don't know whether
they're numbers or face cards?

1412
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:17,880
We don't know. Right.

1413
01:10:17,963 --> 01:10:20,883
I guess he tried to avoid that
as much as possible.

1414
01:10:20,966 --> 01:10:22,676
That concludes Round 1.

1415
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:24,428
Round 2 will now begin.

1416
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:26,180
Please submit your tokens.

1417
01:10:26,764 --> 01:10:27,848
This is tough.

1418
01:10:38,984 --> 01:10:44,365
Five, four, three, two, one.

1419
01:10:45,157 --> 01:10:46,909
All tokens have been submitted.

1420
01:10:46,992 --> 01:10:50,287
Jeong Hyun-gyu,
please choose question or truth.

1421
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:52,623
I will ask a question.

1422
01:10:52,706 --> 01:10:56,794
My strategy was to target
the face cards first.

1423
01:10:57,503 --> 01:10:59,838
How many face cards are there?

1424
01:11:00,673 --> 01:11:02,967
There's only one face card.

1425
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:04,969
-One?
-So-hui.

1426
01:11:05,052 --> 01:11:09,431
Asking for the sum of the face cards
is one of the most critical questions.

1427
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:15,479
Since there are only 4 face cards
and they have values of 1, 11, 12, and 13,

1428
01:11:15,562 --> 01:11:17,856
by asking the card count and their sum,

1429
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:21,610
it is easily possible
to deduce what they are.

1430
01:11:22,861 --> 01:11:25,572
Since I only used one face card,

1431
01:11:25,656 --> 01:11:29,159
even if he asks what the sum is,
I'm just giving up one card.

1432
01:11:29,243 --> 01:11:32,830
I thought he'd ask that,
and lo and behold, he did.

1433
01:11:32,913 --> 01:11:34,790
Round 3 will now begin.

1434
01:11:34,873 --> 01:11:36,417
Please submit your tokens.

1435
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:44,508
All tokens have been submitted.

1436
01:11:45,259 --> 01:11:48,554
Yoon So-hui,
please choose question or truth.

1437
01:11:48,637 --> 01:11:50,848
I will ask a question.

1438
01:11:50,931 --> 01:11:56,395
What is the sum of the cards
in first, second, and third?

1439
01:11:56,478 --> 01:12:00,065
It is 12.

1440
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:02,192
-That's a good question.
-Yes, well done.

1441
01:12:02,276 --> 01:12:03,861
Because they're in ascending order.

1442
01:12:03,944 --> 01:12:05,988
Round 4 will now begin.

1443
01:12:06,071 --> 01:12:07,448
Please submit your tokens.

1444
01:12:10,367 --> 01:12:15,247
Five, four, three, two, one.

1445
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:17,291
All tokens have been submitted.

1446
01:12:17,374 --> 01:12:20,377
Jeong Hyun-gyu,
please choose question or truth.

1447
01:12:20,461 --> 01:12:22,713
This is just like ping pong.
Back and forth.

1448
01:12:23,505 --> 01:12:26,967
I will ask
what the sum of all the hearts is.

1449
01:12:28,093 --> 01:12:29,803
It's 26.

1450
01:12:29,887 --> 01:12:31,680
Twenty six? That's a lot.

1451
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:32,765
This is difficult.

1452
01:12:32,848 --> 01:12:34,433
Round 5 will now begin.

1453
01:12:34,516 --> 01:12:36,101
Please submit your tokens.

1454
01:12:41,774 --> 01:12:46,528
Five, four, three, two, one.

1455
01:12:47,279 --> 01:12:50,699
Yoon So-hui, please choose whether
to ask a question or state a truth.

1456
01:12:50,783 --> 01:12:52,368
They're ping-ponging back and forth.

1457
01:12:53,077 --> 01:12:58,332
What position are any cards
of the same number in?

1458
01:13:02,002 --> 01:13:06,256
Sixth and eighth.

1459
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:10,094
If six and eight are the same,
two of the highest numbers are the same.

1460
01:13:10,177 --> 01:13:11,220
Right.

1461
01:13:11,303 --> 01:13:13,847
Then that can be specified
as a characteristic.

1462
01:13:13,931 --> 01:13:15,641
Bigger numbers later…

1463
01:13:15,724 --> 01:13:18,268
But he said he only has one face card.
No, hang on.

1464
01:13:18,352 --> 01:13:20,229
-Wasn't that So-hui? Yes.
-That was So-hui.

1465
01:13:20,312 --> 01:13:23,273
She hasn't asked that yet,
so she could ask that now.

1466
01:13:23,899 --> 01:13:25,776
Round 6 will now begin.

1467
01:13:25,859 --> 01:13:27,653
Please submit your tokens.

1468
01:13:35,702 --> 01:13:41,667
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five,

1469
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:45,212
four, three, two, one.

1470
01:13:45,963 --> 01:13:47,297
All tokens have been submitted.

1471
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:51,552
Yoon So-hui,
please choose question or truth.

1472
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:53,679
So-hui's going again?

1473
01:13:53,762 --> 01:13:55,973
-That's good for her.
-It's So-hui's turn.

1474
01:13:56,056 --> 01:13:59,059
How many face cards are there?

1475
01:13:59,143 --> 01:14:00,060
Good.

1476
01:14:00,144 --> 01:14:03,021
Yes, she's going for it right away.
She's twigged straightaway.

1477
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:05,107
She's smart.
Did she get him all figured out?

1478
01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:07,401
There are three face cards.

1479
01:14:07,901 --> 01:14:09,778
-Three?
-He has three.

1480
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:13,323
So, if there are three face cards,
and two of them are in sixth and eighth,

1481
01:14:13,407 --> 01:14:16,326
-then seventh is probably a face card too.
-At the end there. Six, seven, eight.

1482
01:14:16,410 --> 01:14:18,454
-Well, seventh might not, though.
-It might not be.

1483
01:14:18,537 --> 01:14:20,539
They might even be the same number.

1484
01:14:20,622 --> 01:14:21,999
So six and eight are just face cards.

1485
01:14:22,082 --> 01:14:24,334
-Right?
-There's a high probability.

1486
01:14:24,418 --> 01:14:26,044
I think So-hui is doing quite well.

1487
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:28,005
Round 7 will now begin.

1488
01:14:28,088 --> 01:14:29,756
Please submit your tokens.

1489
01:14:35,596 --> 01:14:38,307
Three, two, one.

1490
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:40,809
All tokens have been submitted.

1491
01:14:40,893 --> 01:14:41,935
Jeong Hyun-gyu.

1492
01:14:42,019 --> 01:14:43,562
I will ask a question.

1493
01:14:43,645 --> 01:14:47,149
What position are any hearts in?

1494
01:14:47,232 --> 01:14:50,527
Second, fourth and fifth.

1495
01:14:50,611 --> 01:14:51,653
He's focusing on hearts.

1496
01:14:51,737 --> 01:14:54,615
Since the hearts add up to 26, he might
be trying to confirm the face card.

1497
01:14:54,698 --> 01:14:56,408
Round 8 will now begin.

Please submit your tokens.

1499
01:14:58,285 --> 01:14:59,912
All tokens have been submitted.

1500
01:14:59,995 --> 01:15:01,163
Yoon So-hui.

1501
01:15:01,246 --> 01:15:05,792
What position are any clubs in?

1502
01:15:06,585 --> 01:15:11,423
First, third, fifth and sixth.

1503
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:12,424
What?

1504
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:14,510
-That many?
-Has he put a lot in one suit?

1505
01:15:15,385 --> 01:15:17,262
Round 9 will now begin.

1506
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:18,931
Please submit your tokens.

1507
01:15:19,556 --> 01:15:21,016
All tokens have been submitted.

1508
01:15:21,099 --> 01:15:22,100
Jeong Hyun-gyu.

1509
01:15:22,184 --> 01:15:24,520
What position are any diamonds in?

1510
01:15:24,603 --> 01:15:27,773
First and seventh.

1511
01:15:27,856 --> 01:15:29,566
Round 10 will now begin.

1512
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:31,276
Please submit your tokens.

Jeong Hyun-gyu.

1514
01:15:32,486 --> 01:15:34,905
What position are any clubs in?

1515
01:15:34,988 --> 01:15:36,949
Third and eighth.

1516
01:15:37,032 --> 01:15:39,034
So, Hyun-gyu's trying to find out
the suits first.

1517
01:15:39,117 --> 01:15:43,664
I wanted to find the position
and number of each suit, then their sum,

1518
01:15:43,747 --> 01:15:46,375
and use that to calculate the numbers.

1519
01:15:46,458 --> 01:15:48,210
There's one space.

1520
01:15:49,586 --> 01:15:50,546
Is it spade?

1521
01:15:50,629 --> 01:15:52,130
-Spade.
-Spade.

1522
01:15:52,214 --> 01:15:53,215
Sorry.

1523
01:15:54,132 --> 01:15:56,093
Round 11 will now begin.

1524
01:15:56,176 --> 01:15:57,553
Please submit your tokens.

four, three, two, one.

1527
01:16:08,522 --> 01:16:10,107
All tokens have been submitted.

1528
01:16:10,190 --> 01:16:11,316
Yoon So-hui.

1529
01:16:16,947 --> 01:16:20,826
What position are any hearts in?

1530
01:16:20,909 --> 01:16:25,914
There are hearts in seventh and eighth.

1531
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:30,002
Round 12 will now begin.

1532
01:16:30,085 --> 01:16:31,336
Please submit your tokens.

1533
01:16:37,050 --> 01:16:43,140
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five,

01:16:43,223 --> 01:16:47,436
four, three, two, one.

1535
01:16:47,519 --> 01:16:48,895
All tokens have been submitted.

1536
01:16:48,979 --> 01:16:52,524
Yoon So-hui,
please choose question or truth.

1537
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:53,609
It's So-hui again?

1538
01:16:54,318 --> 01:16:59,740
What is the sum of all face cards?

1539
01:16:59,823 --> 01:17:02,034
It's 25.

1540
01:17:02,909 --> 01:17:05,037
I think So-hui must have a vague idea.

1541
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:07,456
If she asks about totals
another three times, it'll be over.

1542
01:17:07,539 --> 01:17:09,124
-So-hui, right?
-Yes.

1543
01:17:09,207 --> 01:17:11,251
Round 13 will now begin.

1544
01:17:11,335 --> 01:17:12,919
Please submit your tokens.

1545
01:17:13,003 --> 01:17:18,008

01:17:18,091 --> 01:17:20,010
All tokens have been submitted.

1547
01:17:20,093 --> 01:17:21,094
Jeong Hyun-gyu.

1548
01:17:21,178 --> 01:17:22,846
I'll ask a question.

1549
01:17:22,929 --> 01:17:26,099
What is the sum of any diamonds?

1550
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:28,769
It's 12.

1551
01:17:28,852 --> 01:17:30,145
Hyun-gyu's still quite far off.

1552
01:17:30,228 --> 01:17:35,025
Hyun-gyu asked a question that would
take him further away if he was unlucky.

1553
01:17:35,108 --> 01:17:36,943
Round 14 will now begin.

1554
01:17:37,027 --> 01:17:38,487
Please submit your tokens.

1555
01:17:41,281 --> 01:17:47,454

1556
01:17:47,537 --> 01:17:51,124
four, three, two, one.

1557
01:17:52,584 --> 01:17:54,127
All tokens have been submitted.

1558
01:17:54,211 --> 01:17:57,464
Yoon So-hui,
please choose question or truth.

1559
01:17:57,547 --> 01:17:59,007
I guess his chest feels tight.

1560
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:00,884
-Oh, dear.
-Look at him hitting it.

1561
01:18:00,967 --> 01:18:03,220
His heart's racing,
like it's about to explode.

1562
01:18:07,349 --> 01:18:13,980
What is the sum of the cards
in first, second, and seventh?

1563
01:18:17,442 --> 01:18:18,777
It's 16.

1564
01:18:19,569 --> 01:18:20,779
Sixteen?

1565
01:18:20,862 --> 01:18:22,531
That concludes Round 14.

1566
01:18:24,825 --> 01:18:26,451
Round 15 will now begin.

1567
01:18:26,535 --> 01:18:28,286
Please submit your tokens.

1568
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:33,333

All tokens have been submitted.

1570
01:18:35,127 --> 01:18:37,838
Jeong Hyun-gyu,
please choose question or truth.

1571
01:18:37,921 --> 01:18:39,214
I will ask a question.

1572
01:18:39,923 --> 01:18:42,884
What is the sum of any clubs?

1573
01:18:42,968 --> 01:18:47,222
The sum of all clubs is 14.

1574
01:18:47,305 --> 01:18:49,391
-14.
-14.

1575
01:18:49,474 --> 01:18:51,476
Round 16 will now begin.

1576
01:18:52,144 --> 01:18:53,311
Please submit your tokens.

1577
01:18:56,690 --> 01:19:00,944
Five, four, three, two, one.

1578
01:19:01,695 --> 01:19:03,822
You have submitted
the same number of tokens.

1579
01:19:03,905 --> 01:19:07,534
Those tokens will be kept,
and two new ones will be given.

1580
01:19:08,118 --> 01:19:09,953
Round 17 will now begin.

1581
01:19:10,036 --> 01:19:11,163
Please submit your tokens.

1582
01:19:15,167 --> 01:19:18,837
Eight, seven, six, five,

1583
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:22,966
four, three, two, one.

1584
01:19:23,049 --> 01:19:24,926
All tokens have been submitted.

1585
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:27,387
-Oh, her red light's come on.
-Her red light's on.

1586
01:19:27,471 --> 01:19:30,098
I knew my red light would come on,

1587
01:19:30,182 --> 01:19:32,517
but I felt something else
was more important.

1588
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:36,813
I already knew a fair bit of information,
so I wanted to get some more.

1589
01:19:38,732 --> 01:19:44,070
What is the sum of the cards
in fourth, fifth, and sixth?

1590
01:19:44,154 --> 01:19:46,782
It's 27.

1591
01:19:46,865 --> 01:19:49,201
The red light comes on
when you have no more than five tokens?

1592
01:19:49,284 --> 01:19:50,327
That is correct.

1593
01:19:51,203 --> 01:19:53,872
Feels like she's asking questions
after already figuring out a lot.

1594
01:19:53,955 --> 01:19:55,207
-She's narrowing it down.
-Almost there.

1595
01:19:55,290 --> 01:19:56,708
I think she's just confirming things.

1596
01:19:58,794 --> 01:20:00,837
Round 18 will now begin.

1597
01:20:00,921 --> 01:20:02,631
Please submit your tokens.

1598
01:20:06,134 --> 01:20:10,555
Five, four, three, two, one.

1599
01:20:11,056 --> 01:20:12,682
All tokens have been submitted.

1600
01:20:12,766 --> 01:20:13,767
Jeong Hyun-gyu.

1601
01:20:13,850 --> 01:20:16,436
What is the sum of any spades?

1602
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:17,562
Four.

1603
01:20:17,646 --> 01:20:19,523
-The sum of all spades is four?
-Yes.

1604
01:20:19,606 --> 01:20:22,484
Spades, four.
So the card in position six is a four.

1605
01:20:22,567 --> 01:20:24,110
That concludes Round 18.

1606
01:20:30,909 --> 01:20:32,786
Round 19 will now begin.

1607
01:20:32,869 --> 01:20:34,079
Please submit your tokens.

1608
01:20:39,584 --> 01:20:45,674
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five,

1609
01:20:45,757 --> 01:20:49,469
four, three, two, one.

1610
01:20:49,553 --> 01:20:51,346
All tokens have been submitted.

1611
01:20:51,429 --> 01:20:52,430
Yoon So-hui.

1612
01:20:52,514 --> 01:20:54,140
I will ask a question.

1613
01:20:56,601 --> 01:20:58,270
Oh, I messed up.

1614
01:21:03,275 --> 01:21:07,571
What is the sum of any diamonds?

1615
01:21:07,654 --> 01:21:10,699
After figuring out the position
of all the hearts and clubs,

1616
01:21:10,782 --> 01:21:12,284
I was left with two spaces.

1617
01:21:12,367 --> 01:21:17,998
So those spaces should be either diamonds,
spades or one of each.

1618
01:21:18,081 --> 01:21:23,253
So, I picked one of them and asked
what the sum of all the diamonds was.

1619
01:21:23,336 --> 01:21:25,380
It's 18.

1620
01:21:26,506 --> 01:21:29,050
Since you need two cards to make 18,

1621
01:21:29,134 --> 01:21:32,178
so I thought,
"Both of these are diamonds."

1622
01:21:32,262 --> 01:21:33,597
There are two.

1623
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:35,849
Yes, there must be two diamonds
if it's 18.

1624
01:21:35,932 --> 01:21:39,102
Card number two plus card number four
should be 18.

1625
01:21:39,185 --> 01:21:44,024
If card number two is a 7,
that means card four must be a face card.

1626
01:21:44,107 --> 01:21:46,234
Round 20 will now begin.

1627
01:21:46,318 --> 01:21:50,906
After asking eight or nine questions,
I mostly knew what the numbers were.

1628
01:21:50,989 --> 01:21:53,825
But I needed to check a few things, so…

1629
01:21:53,909 --> 01:21:55,118
Maybe not?

1630
01:21:55,911 --> 01:21:58,455
So-hui didn't look
like she was quite on track.

1631
01:21:58,538 --> 01:22:00,332
If I could sort things out a bit,

1632
01:22:00,415 --> 01:22:02,417
I could squeeze her out with tokens

1633
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:05,420
and get to ask a lot of questions
for minimal betting.

1634
01:22:05,503 --> 01:22:06,671
Jeong Hyun-gyu.

1635
01:22:06,755 --> 01:22:09,090
How many 2s are there?

1636
01:22:09,174 --> 01:22:11,301
There is just one 2.

1637
01:22:11,384 --> 01:22:14,638
By doing that,
I think I saved a lot of tokens.

1638
01:22:14,721 --> 01:22:19,768
What is the sum of the cards
in first, third, and sixth?

1639
01:22:19,851 --> 01:22:23,313
The total of the cards
in first, third, and sixth is 12.

1640
01:22:23,396 --> 01:22:25,148
That concludes Round 21.

1641
01:22:25,231 --> 01:22:26,483
This is not like Hyun-gyu.

1642
01:22:26,566 --> 01:22:28,276
We're just watching right now,

1643
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:31,363
but if Hyun-gyu has calculated
all the positions and sums

1644
01:22:31,446 --> 01:22:33,073
and all the possible combinations,

1645
01:22:33,156 --> 01:22:35,325
he might have figured out
a few specific numbers.

1646
01:22:35,408 --> 01:22:36,660
But I can't be sure.

1647
01:22:37,911 --> 01:22:39,871
I started narrowing down
the possibilities.

1648
01:22:39,955 --> 01:22:42,040
But I was running out of time,

1649
01:22:42,123 --> 01:22:45,085
and it was coming down to a fight
to confirm a few number cards.

1650
01:22:45,168 --> 01:22:47,128
Round 22 will now begin.

1651
01:22:47,212 --> 01:22:48,713
Please submit your tokens.

1652
01:22:48,797 --> 01:22:55,679
Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.

1653
01:22:55,762 --> 01:22:57,639
You have submitted
the same number of tokens.

1654
01:22:57,722 --> 01:23:01,017
Those tokens will be kept,
and two new ones will be given.

1655
01:23:01,559 --> 01:23:03,478
Round 23 will now begin.

1656
01:23:03,561 --> 01:23:05,647
You have submitted
the same number of tokens.

1657
01:23:05,730 --> 01:23:08,274
In the middle, there were a few rounds
where I didn't bet

1658
01:23:08,358 --> 01:23:10,276
and checked what I'd calculated so far.

1659
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:12,153
I'd been feeling really terrible,

1660
01:23:12,237 --> 01:23:16,074
but in that moment,
I was really able to concentrate.

1661
01:23:16,157 --> 01:23:19,577
I felt a rush of joy, and just for a bit,
my stomach didn't hurt,

1662
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:21,705
while I was doing those calculations.

1663
01:23:21,788 --> 01:23:23,707
Round 24 will now begin.

1664
01:23:23,790 --> 01:23:25,667
Please submit your tokens.

1665
01:23:28,545 --> 01:23:33,425
Five, four, three, two, one.

1666
01:23:33,508 --> 01:23:36,052
Jeong Hyun-gyu,
please choose question or truth.

1667
01:23:36,136 --> 01:23:37,679
I will ask a question.

1668
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:42,475
What is the sum of the cards
in first, second, and third?

1669
01:23:42,559 --> 01:23:44,477
The sum is 13.

1670
01:23:45,103 --> 01:23:46,646
From the certain clues,

1671
01:23:46,730 --> 01:23:50,817
I discovered it while going back
through the questions I'd asked.

1672
01:23:50,900 --> 01:23:54,320
Jeong Hyun-gyu's strategy of asking about
positions and sums of different suits

1673
01:23:54,404 --> 01:23:56,990
has the advantage
of allowing him to infer numbers

1674
01:23:57,073 --> 01:23:59,451
by dint of the rule
that numbers must be in ascending order.

1675
01:23:59,534 --> 01:24:01,619
By cross-checking the answers
to his questions so far

1676
01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:03,913
and correctly deducing
just one specific number,

1677
01:24:03,997 --> 01:24:05,874
he can easily figure out the numbers

1678
01:24:05,957 --> 01:24:08,418
without having
to worry about their position.

1679
01:24:08,501 --> 01:24:14,841
Now, he has just two spaces to deduce
and only three possible combinations.

1680
01:24:14,924 --> 01:24:18,261
Since I knew the order of each suit,

1681
01:24:18,344 --> 01:24:19,554
from that point on,

1682
01:24:19,637 --> 01:24:24,059
I could find the answer
using equations or process of elimination.

1683
01:24:24,142 --> 01:24:26,311
Round 25 will now begin.

1684
01:24:26,394 --> 01:24:27,771
Please submit your tokens.

1685
01:24:31,274 --> 01:24:37,072
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five,

1686
01:24:37,155 --> 01:24:40,617
four, three, two, one.

1687
01:24:41,326 --> 01:24:42,702
All tokens have been submitted.

1688
01:24:44,037 --> 01:24:46,873
Yoon So-hui,
please choose question or truth.

1689
01:24:47,749 --> 01:24:49,626
I will go for truth.

1690
01:24:51,586 --> 01:24:54,422
-She's going for truth.
-Here comes a truth.

1691
01:24:55,757 --> 01:24:59,719
1, 8, 4, 10, 5, 12, 7, 12.

1692
01:25:05,642 --> 01:25:06,643
Yoon So-hui.

1693
01:25:07,852 --> 01:25:10,438
-Yoon So-hui, that is incorrect.
-Goddamn it.

1694
01:25:11,231 --> 01:25:14,526
The numbers that So-hui called out
were all correct except for one,

1695
01:25:14,609 --> 01:25:16,194
so if she got another chance, I'd be dead.

1696
01:25:17,570 --> 01:25:18,988
It's not 1, 8, 4.

1697
01:25:19,072 --> 01:25:20,782
That concludes Round 25.

1698
01:25:20,865 --> 01:25:22,575
What did I do wrong?

1699
01:25:22,659 --> 01:25:24,035
Round 3 will now begin.

1700
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:29,499
What is the sum of the cards
in first, second, and third?

1701
01:25:29,582 --> 01:25:32,836
It's 12.

1702
01:25:33,419 --> 01:25:35,630
She must have written that down as 13.

1703
01:25:36,965 --> 01:25:38,133
It's really not this?

1704
01:25:39,092 --> 01:25:40,510
Have I done something wrong?

1705
01:25:41,219 --> 01:25:44,556
I was thinking, "There's no way
it can be wrong. I've calculated it."

1706
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:47,475
So if it's incorrect,
then something's gone wrong.

1707
01:25:47,559 --> 01:25:49,644
Round 26 will now begin.

1708
01:25:49,727 --> 01:25:51,146
Please submit your tokens.

1709
01:25:53,148 --> 01:25:54,941
What have I done wrong?

1710
01:25:55,024 --> 01:25:57,610
That'll make you completely lose it.
You don't know where it went wrong.

1711
01:25:57,694 --> 01:25:59,571
But it's easy to mess up.

1712
01:25:59,654 --> 01:26:01,114
Something's gone awry.

1713
01:26:07,787 --> 01:26:08,746
I messed up.

1714
01:26:09,497 --> 01:26:10,498
"What could it be?"

1715
01:26:10,582 --> 01:26:12,876
I was so certain, but when I looked down,

1716
01:26:12,959 --> 01:26:16,129
the sum of the first, second,
and third cards was 12

1717
01:26:16,212 --> 01:26:17,505
and I'd written it as 13.

1718
01:26:17,589 --> 01:26:18,590
Damn it.

1719
01:26:18,673 --> 01:26:22,594
Five, four, three, two, one.

1720
01:26:22,677 --> 01:26:24,179
All tokens have been submitted.

1721
01:26:26,848 --> 01:26:29,017
You have submitted
the same number of tokens.

1722
01:26:29,642 --> 01:26:33,771
Those tokens will be kept,
and two new ones will be given.

1723
01:26:36,107 --> 01:26:37,942
Round 27 will now begin.

1724
01:26:38,568 --> 01:26:40,278
Please submit your tokens.

1725
01:26:42,697 --> 01:26:44,616
Or I've got to die.

1726
01:26:51,998 --> 01:26:57,587
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five,

1727
01:26:57,670 --> 01:27:01,716
four, three, two, one.

1728
01:27:02,217 --> 01:27:04,093
All tokens have been submitted.

1729
01:27:04,177 --> 01:27:05,845
You have submitted
the same number of tokens.

1730
01:27:07,055 --> 01:27:10,058
Those tokens will be kept,
and two new ones will be given.

1731
01:27:11,226 --> 01:27:12,393
What? Then…

1732
01:27:12,477 --> 01:27:14,812
Round 28 will now begin.

1733
01:27:16,564 --> 01:27:18,316
Please submit your tokens.

1734
01:27:23,446 --> 01:27:26,616
Jeong Hyun-gyu,
please choose question or truth.

1735
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:34,207
I will go for truth.

1736
01:27:34,290 --> 01:27:35,458
What? Truth?

1737
01:27:36,793 --> 01:27:37,961
I think he'll get it.

1738
01:27:38,044 --> 01:27:39,170
Please state your answer.

1739
01:27:40,713 --> 01:27:43,841
I should just say the numbers
from first to eighth in order?

1740
01:27:43,925 --> 01:27:44,884
That is correct.

1741
01:27:46,928 --> 01:27:49,097
2, 5, 6

1742
01:27:49,180 --> 01:27:51,683
10, J, 4…

1743
01:27:55,812 --> 01:27:57,105
10, 8.

1744
01:27:59,023 --> 01:28:00,275
Jeong Hyun-gyu.

1745
01:28:00,358 --> 01:28:02,110
-It must be right.
-He's right.

1746
01:28:04,487 --> 01:28:05,321
Jeong Hyun-gyu,

1747
01:28:05,405 --> 01:28:06,364
that is incorrect.

1748
01:28:11,828 --> 01:28:12,829
That is incorrect.

1749
01:28:12,912 --> 01:28:14,372
But what we just saw…

1750
01:28:14,872 --> 01:28:17,625
-Then is it this?
-Just the ones in the middle.

1751
01:28:17,709 --> 01:28:18,876
It's either of these two.

1752
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:20,253
So what was in the middle?

1753
01:28:20,336 --> 01:28:23,506
Then whatever happens,
it's going to end within two turns.

1754
01:28:23,589 --> 01:28:25,800
Round 29 will now begin.

1755
01:28:25,883 --> 01:28:27,302
Please submit your tokens.

1756
01:28:30,305 --> 01:28:34,434
Eight, seven, six, five,

1757
01:28:34,517 --> 01:28:38,313
four, three, two, one.

1758
01:28:38,396 --> 01:28:40,690
You have submitted
the same number of tokens.

1759
01:28:41,524 --> 01:28:44,277
Those tokens will be kept,
and two new ones will be given.

1760
01:28:44,777 --> 01:28:46,571
Round 30 will now begin.

1761
01:28:46,654 --> 01:28:48,197
Please submit your tokens.

1762
01:28:51,868 --> 01:28:53,703
You have submitted
the same number of tokens.

1763
01:28:53,786 --> 01:28:55,872
Round 31 will now begin.

1764
01:28:55,955 --> 01:28:57,874
You have submitted
the same number of tokens.

1765
01:28:57,957 --> 01:29:00,335
Round 32 will now begin.

1766
01:29:00,418 --> 01:29:01,878
You have submitted
the same number of tokens.

1767
01:29:01,961 --> 01:29:03,296
They must have the same number left.

1768
01:29:03,379 --> 01:29:05,673
-They keep chucking the same number in.
-Right.

1769
01:29:05,757 --> 01:29:07,467
They're going to keep throwing two.

1770
01:29:07,550 --> 01:29:09,719
You have submitted
the same number of tokens.

1771
01:29:10,428 --> 01:29:13,598
Those tokens will be kept,
and two new ones will be given.

1772
01:29:14,807 --> 01:29:16,225
I guess this is a stalemate.

1773
01:29:20,980 --> 01:29:21,981
Reset again?

1774
01:29:22,982 --> 01:29:25,109
-Yeah.
-She's worked it out.

1775
01:29:25,193 --> 01:29:28,154
-That's why she's not doing anything.
-So-hui's not doing anything. She knows.

1776
01:29:28,237 --> 01:29:33,076
I was so frustrated that I wanted
to go somewhere and buy a token.

1777
01:29:33,159 --> 01:29:35,620
If I could get the chance, I was done.

1778
01:29:35,703 --> 01:29:38,623
So, I just kept wandering around.

1779
01:29:38,706 --> 01:29:40,917
I had nothing more to figure out.

1780
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,044
I really agonized over it.

1781
01:29:43,127 --> 01:29:44,128
Should I keep going like this,

1782
01:29:44,212 --> 01:29:46,422
or should I step back for a turn

1783
01:29:46,506 --> 01:29:50,009
and give the correct answer
on the next turn since I'd have four.

1784
01:29:51,552 --> 01:29:56,516
I had a fifty-fifty chance,
whereas So-hui was certain,

1785
01:29:56,599 --> 01:29:59,685
so I thought
I was going to lose by one turn,

1786
01:30:00,686 --> 01:30:02,188
and I hated it.

1787
01:30:02,271 --> 01:30:03,815
Please submit your tokens.

1788
01:30:15,410 --> 01:30:21,332
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five,

1789
01:30:21,416 --> 01:30:25,420
four, three, two, one.

1790
01:30:25,503 --> 01:30:27,171
All tokens have been submitted.

1791
01:30:28,381 --> 01:30:31,509
Jeong Hyun-gyu,
please choose question or truth.

1792
01:30:35,304 --> 01:30:36,472
Jeong Hyun-gyu.

1793
01:30:36,556 --> 01:30:38,683
I guess So-hui is planning
to bet more on the next turn.

1794
01:30:38,766 --> 01:30:42,228
I suddenly thought,
"Whatever happens is fate."

1795
01:30:42,311 --> 01:30:46,315
He was calculating furiously, which meant
that he didn't know for certain

1796
01:30:46,399 --> 01:30:49,944
while I hadn't done any calculations
for several rounds.

1797
01:30:50,027 --> 01:30:53,197
So I thought, "Whatever happens next,
that's my destiny."

1798
01:30:54,157 --> 01:30:56,033
I had to choose one of two,

1799
01:30:56,117 --> 01:30:58,327
so I kept thinking,
while I was so frazzled.

1800
01:30:58,411 --> 01:31:00,455
Then I thought,
"What would I do if I were So-hui?"

1801
01:31:00,538 --> 01:31:03,541
I thought that she wouldn't
have chosen consecutive numbers.

1802
01:31:03,624 --> 01:31:08,588
There was a question
for figuring out consecutive numbers.

1803
01:31:08,671 --> 01:31:10,715
So I thought that
since she's really smart,

1804
01:31:10,798 --> 01:31:13,509
she wouldn't have chosen
consecutive numbers.

1805
01:31:23,561 --> 01:31:24,562
It's been fun.

1806
01:31:25,354 --> 01:31:26,355
Until now.

1807
01:31:28,024 --> 01:31:28,941
Truth.

1808
01:31:30,735 --> 01:31:37,617
2, 5, 6, 8, 13, 4, 10, 8.

1809
01:31:39,452 --> 01:31:40,661
-Is that it?
-Please.

1810
01:31:41,287 --> 01:31:42,788
Please.

1811
01:31:48,211 --> 01:31:49,504
Jeong Hyun-gyu,

1812
01:31:49,587 --> 01:31:50,880
that is the correct answer.

1813
01:31:53,591 --> 01:31:57,136
The final winner of The Devil's Plan is

1814
01:31:57,220 --> 01:31:58,304
Jeong Hyun-gyu.

1815
01:32:01,349 --> 01:32:03,100
-He was good.
-Congratulations.

1816
01:32:05,186 --> 01:32:06,187
Oh, my gosh.

1817
01:32:08,231 --> 01:32:09,232
Congratulations.

1818
01:32:11,025 --> 01:32:12,485
-Well played.
-Good job.

1819
01:32:12,568 --> 01:32:14,237
-Well played.
-Congratulations.

1820
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:15,571
Really well played.

1821
01:32:18,157 --> 01:32:20,451
Good job. That was a long ride.

1822
01:32:20,535 --> 01:32:24,580
Winning by any means necessary
is what The Devil's Plan is all about.

1823
01:32:24,664 --> 01:32:26,749
I think I enjoyed the whole thing.

1824
01:32:26,832 --> 01:32:28,584
And it was so much fun.

1825
01:32:28,668 --> 01:32:30,127
That's just who I am.

1826
01:32:30,211 --> 01:32:34,966
I just try and do my best at everything
in the way I want.

1827
01:32:35,049 --> 01:32:36,425
It's such a shame.

1828
01:32:36,509 --> 01:32:38,177
I was so disappointed that I didn't win.

1829
01:32:38,261 --> 01:32:41,305
I tried so hard,
so I was pretty downhearted.

1830
01:32:41,389 --> 01:32:44,058
Still I was so glad
that I got to play with Hyun-gyu.

1831
01:32:44,141 --> 01:32:45,768
I really feel like

1832
01:32:45,851 --> 01:32:47,270
I won the lottery this week.

1833
01:32:47,353 --> 01:32:48,396
That's exactly how I feel.

1834
01:32:50,231 --> 01:32:55,945
Jeong Hyun-gyu will receive
380 million won as the final prize.

1835
01:32:59,699 --> 01:33:03,202
I really did a lot of bad things.

1836
01:33:05,037 --> 01:33:06,455
This is that kind of place.

1837
01:33:06,539 --> 01:33:08,499
And having done so many bad things,

1838
01:33:08,583 --> 01:33:11,460
I ended up winning The Devil's Plan.

1839
01:33:11,544 --> 01:33:12,962
Thank you.

1840
01:33:13,629 --> 01:33:16,132
Well played, everyone.

1841
01:33:16,215 --> 01:33:18,134
Well played! Everyone did their best!

1842
01:33:18,217 --> 01:33:19,677
-Well played.
-Congrats.

1843
01:33:21,220 --> 01:33:22,305
Congratulations.

1844
01:33:22,388 --> 01:33:24,974
The Devil's Plan has come to an end…

1845
01:33:25,057 --> 01:33:28,019
-Hey, you kept your promise.
-…with Jeong Hyun-gyu's victory.

1846
01:33:28,102 --> 01:33:29,186
Hyun-gyu, congrats.

1847
01:33:29,270 --> 01:33:32,440
Thank you to all the players
who participated.

1848
01:33:32,523 --> 01:33:34,025
Great job, everyone.

1849
01:33:34,108 --> 01:33:35,943
-Well played. Really.
-Everyone was fantastic.

1850
01:33:36,027 --> 01:33:37,987
-Still, I'm so happy.
-Well played.

1851
01:33:38,070 --> 01:33:39,363
To me, The Devil's Plan…

1852
01:33:39,447 --> 01:33:42,450
…was a big challenge
that took a lot of courage.

1853
01:33:42,533 --> 01:33:44,201
Where I met a lot of great people…

1854
01:33:44,285 --> 01:33:45,953
And learned a lot of things…

1855
01:33:46,037 --> 01:33:49,999
And it's given me a lot of inspiration.

1856
01:33:50,082 --> 01:33:54,962
I've thought a lot about where else
I'd experience something like this,

1857
01:33:55,046 --> 01:33:56,839
where else I'd feel these emotions.

1858
01:33:56,922 --> 01:34:00,718
I challenged myself
for the first time in a long time,

1859
01:34:00,801 --> 01:34:02,386
and I'm so grateful for that.

1860
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:04,722
I think participating in The Devil's Plan

1861
01:34:04,805 --> 01:34:06,474
is probably the best thing
I've done recently.

1862
01:34:06,557 --> 01:34:11,228
I think it's given me the base
to become a better poker player.

1863
01:34:11,312 --> 01:34:13,939
There were a lot of frustrating moments,
but I never gave up,

1864
01:34:14,023 --> 01:34:16,942
and I hope I'll remember that
for a long time

1865
01:34:17,026 --> 01:34:18,819
and get me through tough times
in the future.

1866
01:34:18,903 --> 01:34:22,156
I think I was able to make this far
because of my eagerness.

1867
01:34:22,239 --> 01:34:25,117
And even with that,
I might not make it all the way,

1868
01:34:25,201 --> 01:34:29,205
but I'd be able to
get close to reaching my goal.

1869
01:34:29,288 --> 01:34:31,666
I realized that once again
thanks to this show.

1870
01:34:31,749 --> 01:34:33,209
I realized that I like games

1871
01:34:33,292 --> 01:34:35,670
and that I really like playing games
with other people.

1872
01:34:35,753 --> 01:34:38,798
For the first time in ages,
the joy of participating as a player.

1873
01:34:38,881 --> 01:34:40,383
The Devil's Plan is over,

1874
01:34:40,466 --> 01:34:42,927
but it's leaving me
with the disappointment

1875
01:34:43,010 --> 01:34:44,595
and curiosity of an unfinished book.

1876
01:34:44,679 --> 01:34:47,431
It was short, but it's given me
a lot of precious memories.

1877
01:34:47,515 --> 01:34:49,350
From now on,
I'm going to lead an honest life.

1878
01:34:49,433 --> 01:34:51,268
I've built up too much bad karma.

1879
01:34:51,352 --> 01:34:53,771
One last time. One, two, three!

1880
01:34:55,231 --> 01:34:58,067
-Okay.
-Great job!

1881
01:39:42,476 --> 01:39:47,481
