1
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:14,597
Greetings.

2
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:17,142
Welcome to the hidden stage.

3
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:21,312
If you fail the mission here
in the hidden stage,

4
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:23,690
you will have to relinquish

5
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:26,026
all your Pieces except one.

6
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:28,737
Should've given them away. Damn it.

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,032
Let me explain the hidden stage mission.

8
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:35,201
The hidden stage mission is

9
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:36,995
Knight's Tour.

10
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:42,834
The Knight's Tour involves
moving the knight around the chessboard

11
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:44,961
according to
the proper rules of the knight,

12
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:48,131
passing through
each and every square only once.

13
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:51,885
The object in front of you right now
is a knight.

14
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:56,848
The player will have to
physically move the knight.

15
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:00,769
And the knight must be moved
in an "L" shape,

16
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:03,229
two spaces in one direction

17
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:06,107
and one space to the side.

18
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:08,985
If you land on a square
you have already visited

19
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,781
or cannot make any more valid moves
before completing the board,

20
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:17,202
the board will be reset,
and you must start that round again.

21
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,080
The mission consists
of three rounds in total.

22
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:25,752
And you will play on a 6x6,
7x7, and 8x8 chessboard

23
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:29,214
with the difficulty level getting higher
as the rounds progress.

24
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:31,925
Damn it, I should have tried an 8x8.

25
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:35,595
If you finish all three rounds
within 60 minutes,

26
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:37,555
you will have passed the mission.

27
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:42,727
Here is the chessboard
for Round 1 of the Knight's Tour.

28
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:02,288
Four, five, six,

29
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,706
eighteen, twenty-three.

30
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:08,670
Well, I'd completely
memorized 6x6 and 7x7.

31
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:15,176
You have successfully completed Round 1.

32
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,971
Here is the chessboard for Round 2.

33
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:26,312
One, two, three,

34
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:29,190
four, five, six,

35
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,192
nine, ten,

36
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,443
fifteen…

37
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,156
Fifteen…

38
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,074
Hang on, what came next again?

39
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,325
I was a little confused.

40
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:42,495
Doing it on paper
and doing it on the board

41
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:45,206
while standing on it
were completely different.

42
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,543
Three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten,

43
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:50,920
11, 12, 13, 14, 15,

44
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,882
16, 17, 18,

45
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:56,843
19, 20, 21,

46
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:59,512
22, 23, 24.

47
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:08,855
25, 26, 27, 28,

48
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:12,275
31, 37, 41.

49
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:20,783
Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

50
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:26,581
Two, three, four,

51
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:29,000
five, six,

52
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:32,253
seven, eight, nine.

53
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,840
You have successfully completed Round 2.

54
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:39,135
Here is the chessboard
for the third and final round.

55
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,596
Let's give this a go.

56
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:44,432
Let's see, four, eight…

57
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:46,768
That's 36 for one lap.

58
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:53,358
When So-hui derived
the pattern for how it changes…

59
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:55,235
So where the pattern falls apart…

60
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,278
I'm not positive, but for the 9x9 one,

61
00:03:57,362 --> 00:04:00,323
a 7x7 minus 1 is
where the pattern falls apart.

62
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:04,035
Though I don't know for certain
the principle behind it…

63
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:08,373
And 14, 15, 16, 17.

64
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:09,540
Okay, go here.

65
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:12,001
So no going backwards? Only going forward?

66
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,921
-It turns at 24. It turns at 24 and…
-Pivot here.

67
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:17,215
-Ah, it turns there.
-And then…

68
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:18,633
One,

69
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,177
two,

70
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:23,304
three,

71
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,641
four,

72
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:28,643
five,

73
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,145
six,

74
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,773
seven, eight,

75
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:36,234
nine, ten.

76
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:39,988
11, 12, 13,

77
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:43,574
14, 15, 16,

78
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,952
17, 18,

79
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:49,372
19, 20, 21,

80
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:52,917
22, 23, 24…

81
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,296
This one? 24.

82
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,343
At 25 on the 7x7 board…

83
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:04,304
Hang on.

84
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:09,309
One, two, three, four…

85
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:13,730
As I went around the board,
the pattern I used stopped working at 25.

86
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,690
"If I could solve 5x5, 6x6, and 7x7,

87
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:17,275
there's no need to practice an 8x8."

88
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:18,693
I regretted it so much.

89
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:21,446
18, 19, 20,

90
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:24,032
21, 22, 23,

91
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:24,991
now what?

92
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,285
Darn it, I should have tried an 8x8.

93
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,704
Why didn't I? Damn.

94
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:30,872
13…

95
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,418
I didn't do it right.

96
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:42,300
Take it slow.

97
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:50,558
I'm worried it'll be a big problem
if Hyun-gyu doesn't come back.

98
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:51,768
Why's that?

99
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,896
If he ends up on the other side,
that's trouble for us.

100
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:55,938
A barracuda.

101
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:59,609
If Hyun-gyu ends up on that side, it'll be
dangerous for us in tomorrow's main match.

102
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,486
20,

103
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:03,529
21, 22,

104
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,865
23, 24.

105
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,037
So that's 24.

106
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,872
When it's symmetrical,

107
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:16,125
stick to the middle.

108
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,251
Five.

109
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:19,337
Four.

110
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,465
If you take the wrong path,
you end up getting so far off.

111
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:26,594
So you need 15 or so moves in advance
and then scope things out.

112
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:31,140
Three, four, five, six, seven…

113
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,309
Damn it, I'm getting confused.

114
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:39,607
Here, here…

115
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,984
There's a limit
to how far you can go like that.

116
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:45,947
So, I was thinking how I might be able to
mark it, if I'd brought anything with me.

117
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,615
I only have blotting paper.

118
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,043
Next.

119
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,472
I should go a whole lap.

120
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:29,657
Damn, are they blowing in the draft?

121
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:34,871
Pattern, symmetrical, center.

122
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,833
Okay, let's check it again.

123
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,003
Jeez.

124
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,840
Has it been about 20 or 30 minutes?

125
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,633
It doesn't feel like that long.

126
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,469
It's been 20 minutes,
and he isn't out yet?

127
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,012
-Has it?
-Is it taking him that long?

128
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,274
Don't sigh.

129
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:05,067
-No, never mind. I…
-Stop being all serious.

130
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,195
I was just sighing to relieve stress.

131
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:15,661
In Round 3,
after moving the knight 40 times,

132
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:18,623
he spends a lot of time thinking.

133
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:22,126
Is it perhaps because
he's already gone the wrong way

134
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,671
and there's no path to the end?

135
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,466
There's nowhere to go.

136
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:30,968
Damn it.

137
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:39,810
One.

138
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,522
I'm not very good at exams.

139
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:45,608
When I took my third CSAT,
I didn't get into my first-choice college

140
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:48,152
because I made a silly error
in marking my answer sheet.

141
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,654
It reminded me of that time.

142
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:50,738
One.

143
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,074
Two.

144
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,410
One.

145
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:57,745
How did I get here?

146
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,582
Just one more. One more.

147
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:02,792
One.

148
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:04,961
Why is there one left over?

149
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,552
It's been so long. Hyun-gyu…

150
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,053
-He must've gone over, right?
-Yes.

151
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:16,722
Well, I don't know
whether he's gone or not.

152
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,183
-If it's been this long.
-But I think the result has been decided.

153
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,352
I think it's over.

154
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:24,438
Anyway, he hasn't been eliminated,
so we'll just have to wait until tomorrow.

155
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:25,815
On our side, we…

156
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,359
I mean, he doesn't have to come
and take his luggage now.

157
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:30,236
-He's just not coming back tonight.
-I guess so.

158
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:32,488
I think he's most likely
not coming back tonight.

159
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,799
I feel like I wasted a lot of time.

160
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:55,386
I think I could have solved it quickly
if I'd had some paper,

161
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:56,887
but I didn't.

162
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:16,657
It's so confusing.

163
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,873
Hang on. Wait a sec.

164
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:28,753
Wait a sec. One, two…

165
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:30,046
I think I just got it.

166
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,632
Three, four…

167
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,218
Again.

168
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:38,929
Stuck again.

169
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,851
If I go here first, I can't go there,

170
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:45,895
and if I go here, that one's a problem.

171
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,813
Should I have started over?

172
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:54,236
Okay, calm down. Last try.

173
00:10:55,821 --> 00:11:00,201
Then, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15…

174
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:01,243
Hold up.

175
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,384
This is the last chance. Damn.

176
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:23,140
One, two, three…

177
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:27,770
four, five, six…

178
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,314
What was next?

179
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:34,652
One, two, three, four, five, six…

180
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:35,778
Hang on.

181
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,031
Surely not.

182
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:46,497
Calm down, calm down. You've got it.

183
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:15,818
Keep calm.

184
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,653
Don't slip up.

185
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,062
You have succeeded.

186
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:12,500
THE DEVIL'S PLAN
DEATH ROOM

187
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:21,926
I was confident about the pattern
that brought me to that point.

188
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:24,136
Because it was the symmetrical pattern
I was expecting.

189
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,554
If you look at Knight's Tour,

190
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:29,475
after every lap,
it makes a symmetrical layout.

191
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:31,560
When I followed that order,

192
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,730
it showed the pattern
that I'd seen when I solved it.

193
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,857
So I was confident.

194
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,318
I think my style of play will change.

195
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:42,863
I'd better not end up in prison,
even though I'd like to go.

196
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,089
I'm going to go in here tomorrow.

197
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,675
Hey, that's a completely different matter.

198
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:05,052
-We all want in.
-I'm going in there tomorrow.

199
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,470
We need to decide it.

200
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:09,390
By the way, did you really think
we were betraying you, Justin?

201
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:10,808
During the main match?

202
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,977
You did betray me. The two of you.

203
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,270
They betrayed you?

204
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:18,399
In the game we just played,
the three of them betrayed us.

205
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:20,276
-Who did?
-These three.

206
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,906
I declined to play five against one.

207
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,950
Then I got a new offer and accepted it.

208
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,869
Because these two were already aiming to--

209
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:33,455
Then what did you do, the three of you?
What did you agree to do?

210
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:36,417
We divided it into multiples of three.
She took Rounds 1 and 4.

211
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,085
-Ha-rin took 2 and 5.
-I had no choice.

212
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:40,379
They were going for half each,
if I didn't join.

213
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:41,839
Think about it.

214
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:44,717
If you three banded together,
there's a low chance you'd be eliminated.

215
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,260
But then, what about us?

216
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:50,097
Se-dol, what do you make of it?
The three of them betraying us.

217
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,223
No wonder.

218
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:55,185
There was an alliance, a secret alliance.

219
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:58,355
All I did was
run for the finish line and get killed.

220
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:03,402
I thought it would be good
to team up with Hyun-joon and Eun-yu

221
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:08,282
because during the day,
we had trouble communicating with Se-dol,

222
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:11,535
which caused a lot of trouble for us
with the other team.

223
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,370
There really wasn't during the main match!

224
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:16,790
I mean, of course I want to tell him
it wasn't like that,

225
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:19,418
but then,
you formed a secret alliance just now.

226
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,462
You can't say that it wasn't.

227
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:24,924
I don't know if it was because of the
alliance, but the results turned out well.

228
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:28,552
In the end, I didn't finish first,
and Sang-yeon was eliminated.

229
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,262
I don't think it's right.

230
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:33,432
Se-dol is the only one I trust.

231
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:35,517
But, look. See here--

232
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,938
But we never helped the other team.
In fact, we asked them for help.

233
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,856
Bringing up what happened yesterday.

234
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:44,985
From now on,

235
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:48,113
the only person I trust is Se-dol.

236
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,741
Anyway, what are we
going to do about this?

237
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:52,284
Justin says he's going to go in.

238
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,495
-What are you talking about?
-I'm going in.

239
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:55,913
I want to go in too.

240
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,122
Ha-rin, what about you?

241
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:00,417
Well, I'm just so shocked
by what Justin said.

242
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:03,379
So if he wants to go in, I say go for it.

243
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,631
Okay, you're not going in.
That leaves four.

244
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:07,883
If anyone's going to go for it,

245
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:11,011
I think we should give the person
with the least Pieces

246
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,846
the chance to get some extra.

247
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,099
And that happens to be me and Eun-yu.

248
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:20,354
But I think we're both struggling
with a vague fear of what's in store.

249
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:23,315
Now, how should we decide who goes in?

250
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,110
Rock, Paper, Scissors? Or Remove One?
Or Muk-jji-ppa?

251
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:28,529
I never want to hear Remove One
ever again.

252
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:30,698
We have plenty of time, so--

253
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,241
-You want to play a tournament?
-Sure.

254
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:38,914
He's back!

255
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,624
Hyun-gyu!

256
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,626
-Hey!
-Your clothes… What happened?

257
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,752
I did it.

258
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:44,962
Nice!

259
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:45,921
Yep.

260
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,756
But I don't get anything right now.

261
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,966
What? Then what was it for?

262
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:52,011
Well, they'll give me something
helpful in the final round…

263
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,471
-Oh, they'll give it to you then?
-Yes.

264
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:56,390
If you don't get there, you get nothing?

265
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:58,392
-Right.
-Wow, goodness me.

266
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,185
Awesome!

267
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,104
-I did it.
-Did it go smoothly?

268
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,480
We can stop memorizing it now.

269
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:04,398
Amazing.

270
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:05,733
-Congrats.
-Then no Pieces at all?

271
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:06,734
-No.
-Damn.

272
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:09,987
For a moment,
I thought I was seeing things.

273
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,740
When suddenly,
someone so pale stepped out.

274
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:13,824
I'm exhausted.

275
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,452
Oh, my.

276
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,996
-Oh, it's 11 p.m.
-That gave me a fright.

277
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,456
-I thought…
-Another elimination.

278
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,499
-That startled me.
-Me too.

279
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,084
Hyun-gyu, is there another area?

280
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,377
It was a different place altogether.

281
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:28,672
Pitch black.
I couldn't even see my counter well.

282
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,299
You marked it with your hand?

283
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:31,717
No, with my body.

284
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,427
You had to physically move yourself?

285
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,721
So I used all my blotting sheets.

286
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:37,097
I used them as markers.

287
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:39,308
-Is he back?
-He's back!

288
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,101
He's back!

289
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:42,853
Give him a hug.

290
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:48,692
I'm so happy.
The feeling of seeing one of us come back…

291
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,360
-It's nice.
-Truly.

292
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,613
Okay, then Rock, Paper, Scissors?

293
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:55,074
Since there are four of us,
the first to two wins

294
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,617
just to make it interesting.

295
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,534
Fine by me.

296
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,995
Given that one of us was
definitely going to go,

297
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,290
we decided to play something
quick and simple to save our energy.

298
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:04,583
So we did Rock, Paper, Scissors.

299
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,336
As befits The Devil's Plan,
fair and square.

300
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:08,962
-Okay, will you be the referee?
-Okay.

301
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:09,963
I'm surprisingly nervous.

302
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,882
Your life could be riding on this.

303
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:14,718
Right. If you don't play, you lose.
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

304
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,680
Wow, how could you all go for paper?

305
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,809
Again. If you don't play, you lose.
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

306
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,021
No, I should've gone with rock.

307
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,981
If you don't play, you lose.
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

308
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,316
Rock, paper…

309
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:31,276
I can't bear to watch this.

310
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,153
Hang on, why don't you stand back to back?

311
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,614
If you don't play, you lose.
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

312
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,493
One win. One win?

313
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,578
It's okay, it's just one win.

314
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,456
If you don't play, you lose.
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

315
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,916
Wow, I lost.

316
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:46,834
Nice!

317
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:49,837
Why do you all like your fists so much?

318
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,047
If you don't play, you lose.
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

319
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,800
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

320
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:56,426
Hyun-joon.

321
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,636
Seriously.

322
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:58,762
Okay, one win each.

323
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:01,431
I'm actually scared about going down.

324
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,725
Now I'm just scared of everything.

325
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,103
-Let's do it.
-I have to be in first place.

326
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,689
If you don't play, you lose.
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

327
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:09,857
What the heck?

328
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,316
The rest are all fists.

329
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,568
You win.

330
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:15,154
It was good while it lasted.

331
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,699
-Really?
-Well played.

332
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:21,493
I won, so I'll be the one that goes down.

333
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:25,747
I hope you get ten Pieces and
come back to play with us tomorrow.

334
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,083
I have no idea what's down there, so…

335
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,042
Are you okay?

336
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,127
Well, I have to be.

337
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:34,047
I considered Seung-hyun to be
one of the aces in our prison gang.

338
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,049
She was honest and smart,

339
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:39,720
so I thought she would succeed
and come back in a blaze of glory.

340
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:42,097
I honestly have no idea what game awaits

341
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,183
or what is lurking down there.

342
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:47,311
Bottoms up! Cheers! Bottoms up!
You've been through a lot.

343
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:48,270
Well done.

344
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,355
We've made it safely to the second night.

345
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:53,025
It's nice to hang out
after accomplishing something.

346
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:55,110
I was hoping
for something like this yesterday.

347
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,737
We were exhausted the first night.

348
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,531
We were already tired when we arrived.

349
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,241
Right, we survived thanks to that.

350
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:05,078
But the people who are in prison
have been there the whole time.

351
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:08,165
If they come here
and get to experience this world,

352
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:10,834
-they'd be overjoyed.
-Of course, it must be a huge contrast.

353
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:13,212
I think prison would be depressing.

354
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:16,131
-Not at all.
-It's the second day, the mood over there…

355
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,593
Even though they're suffering physically,
they've still formed close bonds.

356
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:22,763
-I bet the bond is similar to ours.
-It seemed they got closer.

357
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:26,183
I hope none of us end up there,
although that's unlikely.

358
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,977
It's really moving
to hear Hyun-gyu say that.

359
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:32,105
To be honest, we were
desperately waiting for Hyun-gyu.

360
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,107
I'm the youngest now. I see.

361
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:36,652
-Kyuhyun was really waiting for you.
-I was.

362
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,445
Anything you need, just ask.

363
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:39,821
Should've said that earlier.

364
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:43,867
Se-dol, you kept saying
we had to attack one of them.

365
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:44,993
Yeah.

366
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:49,164
Then if I go after someone tomorrow,

367
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,500
would you be willing to help me?

368
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,543
Oh, I love that kind of thing.

369
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:55,504
Really?

370
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,131
By the time you're suggesting it,
I've already got them.

371
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,718
I'm planning to be tougher
starting tomorrow.

372
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,553
I was a bit scared of Ha-rin today.

373
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,138
I think she's pretty unique.

374
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:06,306
-Yes, she is.
-She sure is.

375
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:09,601
Like one of those
scary dolls that walk around.

376
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,687
She comes and whispers,
"I'm going to kill you."

377
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,480
No, we need to kill him via 126.

378
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:15,607
We need to just kill them all.

379
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,693
If you're up against her in a game…

380
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,070
-I'm telling you, she's vicious.
-I agree.

381
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:21,822
She's no picnic.

382
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:23,073
I'd like to give her a go.

383
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:26,118
It'd be a lot of fun to see
Ha-rin and Hyun-gyu face off.

384
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:27,536
She's nailed her character.

385
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,621
I think they've all
got their own character.

386
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:32,457
I think I'm too normal.
I come across as just a regular guy.

387
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,042
What's the basis for regular?

388
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,878
Ordinary people.
That's what we said. "We're too ordinary."

389
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,630
-Too ordinary.
-We're quite normal.

390
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,841
Yes, I really am.
No, So-hui is extraordinary.

391
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:41,925
You think you're normal?

392
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:46,138
-Hey, So-hui.
-I saw you on your bed earlier.

393
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:49,016
-We both saw it.
-You were lying down facing the floor.

394
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:51,143
"Me. I solved it."

395
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:52,894
She really got us to the finish line.

396
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,564
-Yep, let's go to bed.
-Amazing. It's beautiful.

397
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:59,776
Honestly, you really are such a character.

398
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,695
You can't be considered normal.

399
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:02,946
Kyuhyun, are you jealous?

400
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,489
-Are you jealous of that?
-Kyuhyun.

401
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:07,576
Kyuhyun, you're a normie! You're ordinary!

402
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,161
This is unfair!

403
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:11,204
Why was I born so ordinary?

404
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,248
-We have to be go-getters.
-Your expression…

405
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,876
Your expression's saying,
"Hey, where's my spotlight?"

406
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:18,086
I don't care about that.
I just don't like being ordinary.

407
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,005
I don't need the spotlight.

408
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,923
You have a great voice instead.

409
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,884
-Shall we wrap things up?
-Sure.

410
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,594
We need to save ourselves for tomorrow.

411
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:26,887
That was fun.

412
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,805
-Yes, fun time today.
-Good job, everyone.

413
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,432
-Have a good night.
-Night!

414
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,517
-Good night. Sweet dreams.
-Good night.

415
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,394
-Night, everyone.
-Good night.

416
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:35,520
Good night, Kyuhyun!

417
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:38,774
Let's worry about tomorrow
when tomorrow comes.

418
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,484
Good night.

419
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:44,029
Let's do our best tomorrow.
As you said, let's kill it tomorrow.

420
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:45,489
Let's go for it.

421
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:48,492
Let's try something different tomorrow.

422
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:50,994
-I want to stick with you.
-Okay.

423
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:53,413
And maybe team up with Ha-rin too.

424
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:56,124
She's got a touch of
craziness about her, but the good kind.

425
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,542
Something like that.

426
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,211
Can you do that thing before we sleep?

427
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:00,629
What thing?

428
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:04,633
See you in the morning.

429
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:16,978
You can move one or two squares,
and then put up a wall.

430
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:20,440
Interesting?

431
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:21,817
Time to eat.

432
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,152
Oh, is breakfast here already?

433
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,695
Should we wake Hyun-joon?

434
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:28,156
Hyun-joon's a really heavy sleeper.

435
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:33,995
I might be at my lightest weight ever
by the time I get out of here.

436
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,167
I'm feeling nervous.

437
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:44,756
I mean, I am putting my life
on the line after all.

438
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,842
I'm always ready to step in.

439
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,136
I'm ready too.

440
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,638
Let's do Rock, Paper, Scissors again.

441
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,357
Did you sleep well?

442
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:03,942
Yeah, better than yesterday.

443
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:06,445
Anyhow, even if someone
from the living area ends up here,

444
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:09,489
it'll be one or two of them at most.

445
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:14,578
So, all we have to do is
bury them in the prison match.

446
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:16,246
"Bury them"? Dr. Kim.

447
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:18,415
Is it okay to bury someone
under the Hippocratic Oath?

448
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:21,918
Hey, what does Hippocrates have to do
with any of this?

449
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:24,171
Didn't we do that already
in the prison match yesterday?

450
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:26,006
I think I should definitely go for it.

451
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:28,300
Rather than barely clinging on here,

452
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:30,760
I should see what's in there
even if I end up going home.

453
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:32,429
Though I don't want to go home.

454
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,848
Yes. I am quite nervous right now.

455
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,851
Is the ceiling about ten meters high?
Goodness.

456
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,022
Good morning.

457
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:44,399
I can't help but check
if anything's announced.

458
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:46,818
The challenge…

459
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,529
-I don't think they did it.
-They didn't?

460
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:52,657
You think Se-dol didn't try it
with his personality?

461
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:53,867
I don't know.

462
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:55,494
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

463
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:56,745
He's ready.

464
00:24:57,954 --> 00:25:00,540
Come back.
Make sure to come back, Hyun-joon.

465
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,753
May God's blessing be upon me.

466
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,798
I've got goose bumps.

467
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,425
Goose bumps.

468
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,594
This might be the last time I see you.
It was nice having you.

469
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:16,681
-Good luck.
-We've been together since the first day.

470
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:17,933
You played well.

471
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,435
Even if I don't make it,
let's meet again when this is all over.

472
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,811
You've got to come back.

473
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:23,897
When you get back, let's wipe them out.

474
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,482
Is now the time?

475
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:26,441
All right.

476
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,026
Am I really going in here?

477
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:28,985
You can do it.

478
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:30,195
You got this!

479
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:31,821
Make sure to close the cover behind me.

480
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:32,864
Okay.

481
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:36,826
-See you.
-Bye.

482
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,370
-Bye.
-Bye-bye.

483
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,248
Good luck!

484
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:42,666
Come back alive!

485
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:47,879
I hope he nails it.

486
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:58,223
FILMED IN INFRARED AS IT IS PITCH BLACK

487
00:25:58,306 --> 00:25:59,266
What is this?

488
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:03,812
What the heck?

489
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:10,318
I can't see anything.

490
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:14,739
Is this right?

491
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:23,331
Oh, what the heck?

492
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:25,625
What's that noise?

493
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,674
What is it? Damn it.

494
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,385
Please, no.

495
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:38,930
What is that?

496
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:46,813
I kept thinking, "It wouldn't be called
the hidden stage for nothing."

497
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:49,149
Since I was putting my life on the line,

498
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:50,442
the reward would be huge,

499
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:54,404
but I thought the probability of success
would also be low.

500
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:56,031
I crawled in, thinking,

501
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,783
"Today really might be my last day."

502
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,626
What the heck is this?

503
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:11,504
What the heck?

504
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:16,968
I mean…

505
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:28,313
Is this right?

506
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:35,945
It felt like the cargo hold of a ship,
and I thought to myself,

507
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:39,157
"Are they going to make me play
in this narrow space?"

508
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,034
"Then what kind of challenge is it?"

509
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,248
What on earth is this?

510
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:55,715
What on earth is this?

511
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:59,469
Hold on… What's going on?

512
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,407
What is this?

513
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:23,451
Oh, my.

514
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:29,999
Until I got inside, I was convinced
it was going to be Knight's Tour,

515
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,960
and I'd been memorizing the order

516
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,629
right up to the moment
I went into the manhole cover.

517
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:37,173
But when I saw something
completely different,

518
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:38,842
I was flummoxed.

519
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,136
"I'm in deep trouble."

520
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:44,180
The first thing that caught my eye

521
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:47,475
was that there were pictures
drawn on some of the blocks.

522
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,978
Pictures of objects and animals.

523
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:52,981
Like a fox, ice, an arrow,

524
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:54,482
something like a xylophone,

525
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:58,278
and the lowermost blocks
had colors on them.

526
00:28:58,361 --> 00:28:59,779
My first thought was,

527
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:02,574
"How are all these blocks different,
and what do they mean?"

528
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,078
Damn it, that startled me.

529
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:08,371
Welcome.

530
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:10,457
Welcome.

531
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:14,002
This is the prison block's hidden stage.

532
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:16,004
The mission is simple.

533
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:19,632
To succeed, you must put the key
in the keyhole you see in front of you

534
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:21,843
and open the safe.

535
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,429
You have ten minutes.

536
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:29,309
Please focus only on the given task.

537
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:33,480
You will be given a hint
to help you pass this hidden stage.

538
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:44,699
Water.

539
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:46,993
Is it filling up with water?

540
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:51,498
Looking around, there were
all sorts of murals on the walls,

541
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:53,625
and the surroundings felt different.

542
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:55,752
And the water. It was raining so much.

543
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:58,338
I thought I might have to
make the sun rise to stop it,

544
00:29:58,421 --> 00:29:59,964
so I pressed the stone with a sun on it.

545
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:07,722
But I realized an emotional approach
was the wrong way to go about this.

546
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:08,765
What the heck?

547
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,727
I felt the pressure
to do something quickly,

548
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:15,605
and the distraction of water
dripping on my head.

549
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:19,359
I don't think this is right.

550
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,613
The water level kept rising.

551
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:25,532
I was okay until it came up to my calves,

552
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:28,993
but as it continued to rise, I thought,

553
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:32,205
"I'm not doing this right. What do I do?"
And I started to panic.

554
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:34,958
I need to find the key. The key.

555
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,299
What do I need to press?

556
00:30:58,022 --> 00:30:59,482
Your time is up.

557
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:01,860
You have failed the mission.

558
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:03,653
Lee Seung-hyun,

559
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,156
please leave the Devil's Plan immediately.

560
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:19,961
A fox, and the sun, and a question mark.

561
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:21,462
What could these be?

562
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:31,681
What the heck?

563
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:39,147
If I push them, they come out.

564
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,565
Since it said "Find the key,"

565
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:43,484
I thought there might be a key
hidden in one of the blocks,

566
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,570
and I started pushing all of them.

567
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:51,367
That's all of them.

568
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,120
Fox.

569
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:56,331
The first block I saw was the fox.

570
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:57,999
On the Pieces, there were snakes.

571
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:00,001
Out of the various animals,
there was a fox.

572
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:02,503
Then, next to it,
there was a lightning bolt.

573
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,797
And underneath that was the sun.

574
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:08,343
At first I thought, "Is it trying
to tell me some kind of fairy tale?

575
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:12,221
Is it about a fox that got struck by
lightning and something happened to him?"

576
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:14,432
Fox, lightning, sun.

577
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:16,559
The fox, and "find the key."

578
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,436
The fox.

579
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,481
The fox.

580
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:23,107
The cat.

581
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,525
Bird,

582
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,027
elephant,

583
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,362
dog,

584
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:28,404
pig.

585
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:30,406
Once upon a time, there was a cat.

586
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:32,700
Question mark.

587
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,077
"Find the key."

588
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,370
What does it mean?

589
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,121
What the heck?

590
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:45,588
Do I climb them up?

591
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:04,941
What the heck? A bird and a heart.

592
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:13,658
"Find the key."

593
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:19,330
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

594
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,499
"Find the key", ten letters.

595
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:23,918
One, two, three,

596
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,587
four, five, six,

597
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,715
seven, eight, nine,

598
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:30,049
ten, damn it.

599
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:33,136
There were ten letters,
but there were more than ten blocks,

600
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:36,305
so I thought, "Oh, that means
I have to press specific blocks."

601
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:37,348
Okay.

602
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:40,476
First, let's put them all back in.
Push them all back.

603
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:44,689
Put them all in. All of them!

604
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:46,607
I can do it!

605
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,110
Put them all in.

606
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:55,158
Find. F must be fox.

607
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:57,493
I started looking for a picture

608
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:59,746
that started with the same letter
as "Find the key."

609
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:02,081
What's I? That's a sun.

610
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,500
What's I?

611
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:05,460
Ice.

612
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:09,088
Find, F, fox.

613
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,300
Ice. Find.

614
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:14,469
So where's the N? N.

615
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,721
Zebra.

616
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:18,431
This is an orange.

617
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:20,516
Bird, cat.

618
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,281
I can't see.

619
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:42,663
Nose, nose.

620
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:46,501
N. D. B.

621
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:53,132
D! This is direction, right? Direction!

622
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:55,968
T! Tree!

623
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:59,514
H!

624
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:00,973
H.

625
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:02,725
H.

626
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:04,685
Does this mean "hear"?

627
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:17,532
When the water came up above my waist,
it was hard to focus.

628
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:19,200
I couldn't think clearly.

629
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:20,952
This is… This is dog?

630
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,704
And since it's T, "thunder."

631
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:26,374
This is zebra.

632
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,251
Pig.

633
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:30,419
But the real problem

634
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:33,297
was that there were some blocks
that were low down,

635
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:37,802
and I couldn't see them from above,

636
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:43,307
so I thought, "Oh, this is only going to
get worse the longer I take."

637
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,279
I can't see.

638
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,044
There's a heart.

639
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:15,047
Beneath the dog was a heart.

640
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:17,175
I realized, "This is the H."

641
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:22,597
I don't think "direction" is it.
It should be "dog."

642
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:24,849
T!

643
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,018
I've done tree. I've done tree.

644
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:29,395
Is this thunder or tree?

645
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:32,648
I think it's more likely to be tree.

646
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,276
H!

647
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:37,737
I've done heart.

648
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:39,906
E! E!

649
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:44,619
E!

650
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:46,370
Elephant!

651
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,372
K!

652
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:51,375
Knife!

653
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:55,087
This is yellow.
I can barely see it. Yellow.

654
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:57,256
Why isn't it moving?

655
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:01,886
I can't see yellow anymore.

656
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:05,598
It's getting fainter and fainter.

657
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:33,751
What's going on?

658
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:36,337
What's going on? What's this?

659
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:40,299
What's this supposed to be?

660
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:41,509
A block floated up,

661
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,970
and I thought it had
fallen off from somewhere,

662
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:45,388
and I saw a green light.

663
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:48,224
Since it was open,
there was bound to be something in there.

664
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:49,642
So I went down one final time.

665
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:32,351
-What the heck?
-You have passed the mission.

666
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:36,731
What the…

667
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:38,399
Wow! Is this the key?

668
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:46,574
I actually did it!

669
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:54,874
When the door opened,
my emotions were all over the place.

670
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:58,127
I don't think my body was even
functioning properly.

671
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:01,047
I also thought,
"What's so special about these Pieces

672
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,423
that made me do this?"

673
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:04,258
"Is this really happening to me?"

674
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,802
"Did I really beat the hidden stage?"

675
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:08,220
I really couldn't believe it.

676
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:10,681
I was surprised at myself.

677
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:11,724
I can do it!

678
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:17,646
I never thought I'd push myself
to go underwater like that.

679
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:21,609
I think this was one time
when I really tested my limits.

680
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:25,196
And I'll be able to go back to prison
and face my friends with pride.

681
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:29,825
Take the ten Pieces
and return to the living space.

682
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:33,496
I'm never, ever going to do
A Knight's Tour ever again. Honestly.

683
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:36,415
I'm so curious.

684
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:40,669
If it's Knight's Tour, I wonder if you
have to do it on a life-sized chessboard.

685
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:43,547
Open the door!

686
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,424
Hey!

687
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:47,593
Where is that coming from?
I think it's over here.

688
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:48,511
Help me!

689
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:49,720
-What?
-Where is he?

690
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,180
Guys, open the door!

691
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:52,431
It's here!

692
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:53,516
Wow, amazing!

693
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,393
Unbelievable! How do we open it?

694
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:56,352
Hyun-joon!

695
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:57,520
You're alive?

696
00:39:58,187 --> 00:39:59,105
What the heck?

697
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:02,775
-Your hair…
-What happened?

698
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:04,151
What's going on?

699
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,361
It wasn't Knight's Tour.

700
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:06,612
-Then what?
-Why are you wet?

701
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:08,364
Honestly, it was so scary.

702
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:10,408
-Really?
-What was it? What happened?

703
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,868
You're locked in a well.

704
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:15,079
It fills with water
falling on you from above.

705
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:17,706
There are a bunch of clues
all over the walls.

706
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:20,418
But in ten minutes, it fills with water,
so all the clues become submerged.

707
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:21,836
Did you have to swim underwater?

708
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,629
You can't see because they're underwater.

709
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:26,006
So that's why your face is so wet.

710
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,092
Can you open your eyes underwater?

711
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:29,176
Yeah, I had to.

712
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,012
I would have failed.

713
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,222
-Hyun-joon.
-You did great.

714
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:35,808
-Just wow, Hyun-joon.
-So what about your reward?

715
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:38,477
When I opened the safe,
there were some Pieces inside.

716
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:40,855
Let's open it.

717
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:41,981
Well done!

718
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:43,232
Okay!

719
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:46,444
-Wow, that's really amazing.
-I might even cry.

720
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:47,486
There are ten.

721
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,822
Five, six, seven, eight…
Yeah, ten in total.

722
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:52,074
-You're in first place now.
-You're set!

723
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:53,576
-Hyun-joon!
-You're set!

724
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:55,327
Let's win this!

725
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,372
I'm so envious of Hyun-joon.

726
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:01,375
When else would you experience this?

727
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,043
I was quite disappointed.

728
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,837
On the first day,
when we found the hidden stage,

729
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,964
I hadn't contributed much,

730
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:09,800
so I felt too bad to say I'd go in.

731
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,552
Well, there's nothing I can do about it.

732
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:15,890
Ji-yeong, how are you
communicating with the other team?

733
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:17,850
Well, I was on the same team as Eun-yu.

734
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:19,977
So that's why you have a connection.

735
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,687
It's the same with Kyuhyun.

736
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:25,024
-Right, on the Blue Team…
-So, that's what the connection was.

737
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:26,066
So,

738
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:28,486
it's Ha-rin or Eun-yu today?

739
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:30,237
Let's go with Ha-rin.

740
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:31,197
Definitely?

741
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,866
Yes, because
I've played with her once before.

742
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:36,660
Oh, on the Green Team?
I'll talk to Eun-yu as well.

743
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,787
Sure, let's play it by ear.

744
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:40,414
Yeah, Eun-yu is also really good.

745
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,666
Hyun-joon, this is what we discussed.

746
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:45,044
Let's not waste any time
talking to the other team

747
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:46,670
and just quickly strategize
among ourselves.

748
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:49,256
We're not saying we have to
be a team no matter what.

749
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,843
But yesterday, Ji-yeong
and some of the others came to our room

750
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:55,012
and acted like
they were going to play with us,

751
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:57,348
but ended up sticking with the others
and got first place.

752
00:41:57,431 --> 00:42:00,351
I hope nothing like that happens today.
It's okay to communicate, but…

753
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:02,978
-We need to stop giving them information.
-Exactly.

754
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:04,939
So be careful about leaking information,

755
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:07,399
but without offending them
too much, right?

756
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:10,653
Since I have a lot of Pieces,
they're definitely going to approach me.

757
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:12,029
-Right.
-They definitely will.

758
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:14,448
I'll chat with them
and see what I can learn.

759
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:17,868
There are a lot of highly strategic people
on that side,

760
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:21,497
so I think we have to prevent them
from keeping their alliance.

761
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,207
For our survival.

762
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:25,668
To be honest, when I heard that
I thought of something.

763
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:29,588
I'm really hesitant to bring this up
since I have the least Pieces,

764
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:34,468
but each of us should have a certain
amount of Pieces going into today's game.

765
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:38,305
I'm not asking you to give me some,
but maybe you could lend me some?

766
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:41,850
I can lend some, and you can pay me back

767
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:43,519
when you have three or more.

768
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:45,729
Having one Piece or two
makes a big difference.

769
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:46,897
Give her one, then.

770
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:49,942
I think they might eliminate
whoever has the fewest Pieces today.

771
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:51,235
Yes, I think so too.

772
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:52,611
Now we are, well…

773
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:53,696
You're a good sport.

774
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:55,948
-I feel so ashamed. Thank you.
-Good job.

775
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:56,907
No worries.

776
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,534
I'll pay you back ASAP.

777
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:00,077
So-hui.

778
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:04,331
I want to give you a Piece
for helping me open that door.

779
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:05,708
-Are you sure?
-It's fine.

780
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:07,793
-Did you get some Pieces?
-No, I didn't.

781
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:09,336
-No, you keep it.
-Still…

782
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,839
It might be elimination,
not just prison today.

783
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:14,592
-Exactly. You never know. So you keep it.
-Just take one.

784
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:18,345
Okay. After this is over,
I'll accept it if we end up here.

785
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:21,056
Okay. Kyuhyun, I'll give you one too
when I earn some more.

786
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:21,974
Sure.

787
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:23,934
Thanks.

788
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:26,645
Half of us are going to
end up in prison, aren't we?

789
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:28,731
-I think we might even be eliminated.
-Right.

790
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:30,441
We have to fight that hard.

791
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:32,484
So that I won't regret it
if I get eliminated.

792
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:34,653
Yeah, I think two will get sent off
during the main match.

793
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:37,740
We should've spilled some blood yesterday
and just exiled them.

794
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:40,117
If we'd done that, they'd all be dead.

795
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,870
-We could have killed them all.
-To be honest, that's true.

796
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:45,039
It's unlikely we'd be killed,
for the most part.

797
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:47,041
Why do I have so many regrets
about yesterday?

798
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:50,461
-But we didn't feel like this yesterday.
-No, we didn't.

799
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:53,464
I think we feel this way
because we watched poor Sang-yeon

800
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:56,800
go there alone and shake in his boots
as they killed him.

801
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:58,010
You're right.

802
00:43:58,093 --> 00:44:00,638
And I think we need to
try and eliminate Se-dol.

803
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:01,722
That's true.

804
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:05,059
That'd work better for us, down the line.

805
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:07,603
We should get rid of those
who we think might be variables.

806
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:09,897
But rather than strong contenders,

807
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,107
those who aren't a good fit
when we play together.

808
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:15,361
Exactly, that's what I mean.
But I just expressed it as a variable.

809
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:17,571
Exactly, the person who…

810
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:21,033
who is least likely to cooperate with us.
That's our main enemy.

811
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:22,368
Too much of a variable.

812
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,244
Let's go.

813
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,748
The main match will begin shortly.

814
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:30,918
All players, please make your way
to the game area.

815
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,169
Okay, let's go.

816
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:33,837
Eun-yu, please don't betray me.

817
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:36,674
Betrayal? The three of us are
already labeled as betrayers,

818
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:38,300
-so I can't afford to do it.
-Eun-yu.

819
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:39,843
Help me when I need it.

820
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:40,886
Of course.

821
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:44,098
Somehow, standing here,
I feel just like a gladiator.

822
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:47,142
Let's play really well
in today's main match.

823
00:44:48,977 --> 00:44:50,688
There's nothing set out.

824
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:52,272
Oh? Hello.

825
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:54,858
-We're here.
-There you are.

826
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:57,027
What's happened since we saw you?

827
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:59,947
Thank you. Thanks for the protein drink.

828
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:00,948
We saw you.

829
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:04,284
Yes, it was really impressive. Honestly. I
thought, "How did he do that?"

830
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:10,040
You went through a lot, honestly.

831
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:12,209
Did anything happen
on your side yesterday?

832
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:13,752
On our side? Hyun-gyu…

833
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:15,921
-Did he go?
-Yes, he solved something.

834
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:16,964
-Really?
-Yes.

835
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:18,549
Good morning.

836
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:22,386
The third main match
of The Devil's Plan will begin now.

837
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:24,847
As a result of yesterday's prison match,

838
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:27,015
Park Sang-yeon was eliminated,

839
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:30,185
which leaves 11 players still in the game.

840
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,855
Before we start today's game,

841
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:35,899
here is the current Piece count
of each player now.

842
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:37,484
CHOI HYUN-JOON

843
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:39,486
-Was it Hyun-joon?
-It's Hyun-joon?

844
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:40,821
Hyun-joon.

845
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:45,576
Currently,
Choi Hyun-joon possesses the most Pieces.

846
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:46,660
He survived his ordeal.

847
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:50,748
Let me introduce the third main match.

848
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:52,583
Let's go!

849
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:54,543
Today's main match is

850
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:56,420
Halloween Monster.

851
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:57,963
-Goodness.
-What? What's that?

852
00:45:58,046 --> 00:46:01,467
Halloween Monster is a game where you
defeat monsters on the battlefield

853
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:03,927
to earn victory points and loot.

854
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:05,095
-Loot?
-Monster?

855
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:06,305
Before the game starts,

856
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:08,932
each player will be given
five victory points

857
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:11,935
and a basic weapon card, the Dagger.

858
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:15,147
During the hour before the game starts,

859
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:17,566
players will have only one opportunity

860
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:21,361
to go to the dealer room to institute
an alliance with whomever they wish.

861
00:46:22,362 --> 00:46:27,034
An alliance may have
a maximum of three members.

862
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:30,746
Each player may only belong
to one alliance,

863
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:34,666
and once an alliance is formed,
it cannot be dissolved or changed.

864
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,835
-It's an overt alliance.
-It's very important.

865
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:38,253
When a round starts,

866
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:40,964
you will have 20 minutes
to visit the dealer room

867
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:43,425
and transfer your victory points
to another.

868
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:46,303
You may only share points
within your alliance,

869
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:51,433
and you must ensure
that each player has at least one point.

870
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:53,644
Once all transfers have been completed,

871
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:56,063
the order of turn to attack
shall be determined

872
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:58,982
in order of victory points
from highest to lowest.

873
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:01,276
If there is a tie,

874
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,279
the order shall be determined
by drawing lots.

875
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:06,615
Once the game starts,

876
00:47:06,698 --> 00:47:09,660
the battlefield and the reserve pool
will be revealed.

877
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:14,414
These targets are
the very monsters you must defeat.

878
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:17,251
Each monster has
a different amount of victory points

879
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:21,755
and loot such as Pieces
or special weapon cards.

880
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:25,217
Each monster has health
equal to its victory points,

881
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:28,053
which are represented
by a heart and a number.

882
00:47:28,136 --> 00:47:29,429
This is going to be fun.

883
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:33,058
Now, let me explain
how to attack a monster.

884
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:36,520
The battlefield is marked
with a double solid line,

885
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:41,400
and players can only attack targets
that are on the battlefield.

886
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:45,320
You must attack once when it is your turn.

887
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:47,698
You may not forfeit an attack.

888
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:51,577
For 30 minutes,
players may enter the dealer room,

889
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:55,581
choose a number on the battlefield
marked by the double solid line,

890
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:58,458
and present a weapon card to use
for their attack.

891
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:02,170
Only one weapon card may be used per turn.

892
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:04,756
The basic weapon card, the Dagger,

893
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,592
can be used every round

894
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:08,635
and will be returned
to the player after use.

895
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:13,891
Special weapon cards will be discarded
after a single use.

896
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:18,729
Each weapon card
has a different attack power,

897
00:48:18,812 --> 00:48:22,149
and when used,
the battlefield monster's health decreases

898
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:25,110
by the attack power of that weapon card.

899
00:48:25,193 --> 00:48:28,280
When the monster's health reaches 0,
it dies.

900
00:48:28,363 --> 00:48:29,323
It's HP. Hit points.

901
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,617
Let me explain about weapon cards.

902
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,076
This is the basic weapon card.

903
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,370
Dagger, 3 attack power.

904
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:39,249
It reduces the health of the monster
that it is used against by 3.

905
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:42,085
The following are special weapon cards.

906
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:44,421
Poison, 1 attack power.

907
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:47,257
The health of the monster
that this is used against

908
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:51,887
reduces by 1 on every player's turn
until it dies.

909
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:55,432
Ice, 3 attack power.

910
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:59,019
The health of the monster that this is
played against reduces by 3,

911
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:02,481
but the monster will not be affected
by attacks from other players

912
00:49:02,564 --> 00:49:07,819
until the player who played the Ice card
has their next turn.

913
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:11,990
Dual Swords, 4 attack power.

914
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:15,535
It can be wielded
on either one or two battlefields.

915
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:19,414
If used against one monster,
that monster loses 4 health points.

916
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:23,335
If used against two monsters,
they lose 2 health points each.

917
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:24,252
Oh, Dual Swords.

918
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:26,672
Grenade, 6 attack power.

919
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:30,926
Any monster this card is played against
loses 6 health points.

920
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:33,679
Dynamite, 10 attack power.

921
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:37,099
The monster that is in the battlefield
that the card is used against

922
00:49:37,182 --> 00:49:40,686
will lose 10 health points
on the player's next turn.

923
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:44,606
Once every player has finished
selecting their target and weapon,

924
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:49,152
the attacks are initiated automatically in
sequence according to the order of attack.

925
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:52,280
If a weapon card with an attack power

926
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:55,617
is greater than the monster's
remaining health is played,

927
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:59,413
the monster dies
and the excess attack power is lost.

928
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:03,000
When attacks are carried out,
the monster's remaining health points,

929
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:07,921
the player who attacked it
and the weapon they used are not revealed.

930
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:09,965
However, when a monster is killed,

931
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:13,802
the player who delivered the final blow
is revealed,

932
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:17,973
and that player is awarded
the monster's victory points and loot.

933
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:21,810
The dead monster is immediately removed
from the battlefield,

934
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:24,938
and the monster on the first spot
of the reserve pool

935
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:27,733
automatically takes the empty spot
on the battlefield.

936
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:30,610
From then on,
the attacks of any subsequent players

937
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,946
who selected to play
against the dead monster

938
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:36,366
shall be carried out on the new monster
in its place.

939
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:41,204
In addition, players can pay one Piece
to purchase a special item.

940
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:45,292
The Scouter card can be used
before the transfer of victory points,

941
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:48,545
and allows the player
to go to the dealer room

942
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:51,506
and check the health points
of each monster on the battlefield.

943
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:55,761
The Change the Order card shall be
submitted together with your weapon card,

944
00:50:55,844 --> 00:51:01,016
and allows the player to change
their order to whenever they wish.

945
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:05,353
All special items and weapon cards,
except for the Dagger,

946
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:08,690
can be transferred or exchanged
regardless of alliances.

947
00:51:09,357 --> 00:51:13,278
The round ends when
all players' attacks have been initiated.

948
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:16,239
Round 2 begins in the same way

949
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:19,409
with the members of each alliance
transferring victory points.

950
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:20,827
Starting from Round 2,

951
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:23,747
if multiple players have
the same number of victory points,

952
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:28,043
they will be placed in reverse order
to their turn in the previous round.

953
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:32,672
The game ends when
all the monsters from the reserve pool

954
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:34,841
move to the battlefield
and have been killed.

955
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:36,301
When the game ends,

956
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:39,638
the points of players in an alliance
shall be added up

957
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:43,642
and divided by the number of players
in the alliance and shared equally.

958
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:48,146
At this time, points will be calculated
to one decimal place.

959
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:52,943
The player with the highest final score
shall earn six Pieces.

960
00:51:53,026 --> 00:51:56,655
In the event there are multiple players
with the highest score,

961
00:51:56,738 --> 00:51:59,241
the Pieces shall be shared equally
among them.

962
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:02,285
Now, let me explain today's prize mission.

963
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:03,495
No killing, then?

964
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:05,413
At the end of the main match,

965
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:08,583
100 million won will be added
to the prize fund

966
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:10,210
if only one player is eliminated.

967
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:11,586
One person eliminated?

968
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:16,049
You now have one hour to form alliances.

969
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:17,926
Players wishing to form an alliance,

970
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:22,305
please go together to the dealer room
to register your alliance.

971
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:25,976
I had a gut feeling the prize mission
would be something like that.

972
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:26,977
The funny thing is,

973
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:29,604
they didn't reveal anything
about how you get eliminated.

974
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:33,358
I still don't know how people can be
eliminated based on the current rules,

975
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:36,987
so I think I'll have to think about
who to eliminate and how.

976
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:38,196
I'll have to ask.

977
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:41,449
I haven't yet heard
how someone can be eliminated,

978
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:43,743
but we have to send
at least one person home today.

979
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:45,412
Too bad it's only one person.

980
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:47,289
What's the plan here?

981
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:50,208
We're thinking Kyuhyun,
or maybe three like this.

982
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:52,544
We're talking about
how to divide into threes,

983
00:52:52,627 --> 00:52:54,462
because there will be two people left.

984
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:57,382
Then are you two going
to make a three with Kyuhyun?

985
00:52:57,465 --> 00:52:59,718
That's what we're thinking for now.

986
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:03,054
Because the two of us have no connection
with the prison block.

987
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:06,099
So you being over there is better.

988
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:08,685
-Don't you want to be in a three?
-Me?

989
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:10,604
-Three is better.
-First up, I'm looking for three.

990
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:12,564
No. What I mean is,

991
00:53:12,647 --> 00:53:14,566
after we form the three, is that all?

992
00:53:14,649 --> 00:53:18,320
See, this may sound harsh,
but that's the only way it can go.

993
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:21,114
It's going to be three teams of three.
So one of the two will die.

994
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:22,908
The two-man team?

995
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:25,243
Se-dol and Justin.

996
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:27,662
The lethal blow gets the points.

997
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:29,873
Yes, the final hit gets the points.

998
00:53:29,956 --> 00:53:31,791
But it might be dead already.

999
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:35,712
It might be dead and you might
end up attacking another one.

1000
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:39,174
The dead monster is removed
from the battlefield,

1001
00:53:39,257 --> 00:53:42,135
and a new monster takes its place.

1002
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:45,180
Players further down the order
who attack the same spot

1003
00:53:45,263 --> 00:53:48,725
will automatically attack the new monster,

1004
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:53,146
so cooperation as part of
a reliable alliance is essential.

1005
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:56,942
I wanted to team up with you.

1006
00:53:57,025 --> 00:54:02,030
Because you were a corrupt cop, so
you kept a low profile in the first game.

1007
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:05,408
We don't really know you,
but from what we watched,

1008
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:07,535
we think you did pretty well.

1009
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:08,495
But,

1010
00:54:09,454 --> 00:54:12,374
I want to stick up for Kyuhyun and So-hui.

1011
00:54:12,457 --> 00:54:14,501
So you three agreed to work together?

1012
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:16,962
No, we didn't. We agreed to mix things up.

1013
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:18,713
Let's team up with Ha-rin.

1014
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:21,132
-Do you think that'll work?
-Yes.

1015
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:22,842
Ha-rin is quite calm,

1016
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:26,054
but what you have to think about is
that she has three Pieces.

1017
00:54:26,137 --> 00:54:30,725
I'm not sure if it's good to use
a lot of Pieces to buy these things.

1018
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:32,894
You can't make Ha-rin buy them.

1019
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:34,854
You have loads. Spend some cash.

1020
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:36,815
But you can't just
ask me to spend my cash.

1021
00:54:36,898 --> 00:54:39,484
-That's true. That would be wrong.
-I should get something.

1022
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:41,361
Something I get if it goes well.

1023
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:42,946
I was just saying. Hey, what did you do?

1024
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:44,906
-Are you curious?
-Yeah.

1025
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:47,492
I did Wall Go.

1026
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:48,827
You did Wall Go?

1027
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:49,786
What did you do?

1028
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:52,205
-I played a game I've never seen before.
-What?

1029
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:53,665
I was trapped in a well.

1030
00:54:53,748 --> 00:54:56,501
Originally, I wanted to play
with Kyuhyun and So-hui,

1031
00:54:56,584 --> 00:54:59,504
but if we formed a team,
I thought things might get complicated.

1032
00:54:59,587 --> 00:55:02,299
So I decided to try working
with those from the prison block.

1033
00:55:02,924 --> 00:55:04,843
-Let's play together.
-The three of us?

1034
00:55:04,926 --> 00:55:06,970
Yes, the three of us.

1035
00:55:07,053 --> 00:55:08,847
-I think--
-Let's go to a room and chat.

1036
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:12,892
In my opinion, it's definitely
advantageous for three-man alliances.

1037
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:16,396
If you play alone, your turn will be
fixed in the middle of the pack,

1038
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:19,524
and everyone will play
knowing that information.

1039
00:55:19,607 --> 00:55:22,027
I'm going to play
with Hyun-joon and Ha-rin.

1040
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:24,112
Then I'll put Eun-yu in there.

1041
00:55:24,195 --> 00:55:27,032
And let's just play
as a six like that, because--

1042
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:28,408
Not as a nine?

1043
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:31,244
Let's play as a six
and get rid of Se-dol's team.

1044
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:33,163
I agree with that. Deal.

1045
00:55:33,246 --> 00:55:35,123
If I make it to the final,

1046
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:38,084
the person I least want to face is Se-dol.

1047
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:41,254
I don't think it'll be easy to beat him
in a one-on-one.

1048
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:43,298
They were talking
about getting rid of Se-dol.

1049
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:47,177
First, I didn't catch their meaning,
but later I understood.

1050
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:51,681
To be honest, I don't want to see him go,
so I hope he will play well today.

1051
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:55,560
Right. As I said,
I think the two of you should go

1052
00:55:55,643 --> 00:55:58,938
and make a team of three with Eun-yu.

1053
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:00,482
Let's make a three with Eun-yu.

1054
00:56:00,565 --> 00:56:01,649
What about you?

1055
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:04,110
I'm going to go with Kyuhyun and So-hui.

1056
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:06,237
But she has to okay the plan.

1057
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:07,864
I'm just going to put it out there.

1058
00:56:07,947 --> 00:56:09,824
There are three teams of three,

1059
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:12,118
and I think one of the remaining two
will end up leaving.

1060
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:15,288
Hyun-gyu has proposed
trying to get rid of Se-dol.

1061
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:18,958
The guys in the living area
had already agreed

1062
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:20,251
to get rid of Se-dol.

1063
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:22,045
Ha-rin is going to play with Hyun-gyu.

1064
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:24,089
-Ha-rin's playing with Hyun-gyu?
-Yes, with Hyun-joon.

1065
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:26,841
I didn't have any options.

1066
00:56:27,592 --> 00:56:30,136
What do we do?
We don't have to do what they decide.

1067
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:33,390
Are we obliged to do
whatever that team decides for us?

1068
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:35,892
-Isn't that what we just agreed to?
-It is.

1069
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:39,562
Do teams of three, three, and three
mean we're in an alliance of nine?

1070
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:40,647
-Sort of.
-Right?

1071
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:43,149
Then do we have to share
what we're going to play?

1072
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:45,360
We haven't discussed that in detail.

1073
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:48,071
So, we have to formalize our alliance
to be able to do that.

1074
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:50,448
-So that there'll be no take-backs.
-Exactly. Let's go.

1075
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:51,491
Hello.

1076
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:52,659
Hello.

1077
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:54,369
Do you all agree to the alliance?

1078
00:56:54,452 --> 00:56:55,412
-Yes.
-Yes.

1079
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:58,498
Son Eun-yu, 7high, and Kang Ji-yeong,

1080
00:56:58,581 --> 00:56:59,916
your alliance has been formed.

1081
00:56:59,999 --> 00:57:02,585
Kim Ha-rin, Jeong Hyun-gyu,
and Choi Hyun-joon,

1082
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:03,962
your alliance has been formed.

1083
00:57:04,045 --> 00:57:06,339
Kyuhyun, Yoon So-hui, and Tinno,

1084
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:07,757
your alliance has been formed.

1085
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:11,136
CURRENT ALLIANCES

1086
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:13,388
What are you doing?

1087
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:16,474
We're discussing what to go after first.

1088
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:17,809
Tell me.

1089
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:20,395
We don't know yet either.
Have you got an alliance?

1090
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:22,439
-I'm one.
-One by yourself?

1091
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:25,817
So you're going to play as a trio.
I thought you'd play by yourself.

1092
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:28,695
If I were you, I'd play by myself.

1093
00:57:31,322 --> 00:57:33,450
Even just playing as a twosome
would be better.

1094
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:35,160
We've already made it.

1095
00:57:35,243 --> 00:57:36,870
-You registered?
-Yes.

1096
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:40,457
They're playing as a three.
Hyun-joon says he's playing as three.

1097
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:42,834
Then how about we play as a two?

1098
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:45,879
How about playing as individuals
but sharing information?

1099
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:48,965
Okay, let's do that then.

1100
00:57:49,674 --> 00:57:52,260
Oh, that's right.
I wasn't looking at the items.

1101
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:54,137
Yes, let's figure out the items.

1102
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:55,889
We need to look at these.

1103
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:59,142
"But the monster will not be affected
by attacks from other players…"

1104
00:57:59,225 --> 00:58:00,185
What the heck?

1105
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:01,728
Exactly, the Ice is strange.

1106
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:05,815
Attacks against a monster
that has been frozen will have no effect

1107
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:09,068
until the person who played the Ice card
has their next turn.

1108
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:10,987
Ice is unpredictable.

1109
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:12,572
But isn't the Poison good too?

1110
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:15,825
If it dies with your Poison's effect,
you get all the points, right?

1111
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:17,577
Use the Poison on the Witch,

1112
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:20,830
and if we counted it right,
we can get all the points in one go.

1113
00:58:21,414 --> 00:58:25,960
Poison takes one health point
from the monster each turn.

1114
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:28,338
It is possible to kill a strong monster

1115
00:58:28,421 --> 00:58:31,090
by correctly calculating
when to use the Poison,

1116
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:35,136
but another player could also interfere
and steal the loot.

1117
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:36,888
The Poison is -1.

1118
00:58:36,971 --> 00:58:39,432
If the next player uses a Dagger,
does the -3 get taken first?

1119
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:40,475
The -3 is first.

1120
00:58:40,558 --> 00:58:42,936
The Poison comes after
all other special items.

1121
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:45,855
-The Dynamite doesn't go off right away.
-Nope.

1122
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:48,066
But the player who uses it

1123
00:58:48,149 --> 00:58:51,236
will reap the benefit on their next turn.

1124
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:56,032
I think this will have a huge impact
on the elimination mission,

1125
00:58:56,115 --> 00:58:58,826
because everything else is open.

1126
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:01,204
I doubt they used a question mark

1127
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:02,664
just to hide the points.

1128
00:59:02,747 --> 00:59:03,706
I agree.

1129
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:05,875
I think I got it.

1130
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:08,836
When the Grim Reaper enters
the reserve pool, the loot is revealed.

1131
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,756
So maybe the loot is
something that can kill someone.

1132
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:13,508
The team with it can kill someone.

1133
00:59:13,591 --> 00:59:15,301
-That's why it's revealed then.
-Right.

1134
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:16,636
Damn, I think he's right.

1135
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:18,346
It might also be stealing Pieces.

1136
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:20,431
Since no Pieces means elimination.

1137
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:23,268
-That's logical. After all, a Grim Reaper.
-Wow, goose bumps.

1138
00:59:23,351 --> 00:59:24,435
Yes, the Grim Reaper.

1139
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:27,146
-The loot is someone else's Pieces.
-Stealing Pieces.

1140
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:28,314
That makes sense.

1141
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:29,399
I got chills.

1142
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:32,986
I think we can use loot to make
someone leave The Devil's Plan.

1143
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:34,279
Hence the Grim Reaper.

1144
00:59:34,362 --> 00:59:37,031
There's a lot we can do
if the six of us work together.

1145
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:37,949
Exactly.

1146
00:59:38,032 --> 00:59:41,744
We can inflict 3 damage per person
for a total of 18.

1147
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:44,330
Don't you think something's a bit off?

1148
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:46,958
Why are the other guys meeting without us?

1149
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:51,796
I think they're strategizing
to win something for themselves.

1150
00:59:51,879 --> 00:59:53,881
Anyway, there's a major variable now.

1151
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:58,136
Hyun-joon picked up ten Pieces in prison,

1152
00:59:58,219 --> 01:00:01,806
and now he's formed an alliance
with one of the players

1153
01:00:01,889 --> 01:00:04,058
from the side of the living area.

1154
01:00:04,142 --> 01:00:05,685
Looking at it objectively,

1155
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:09,105
that means the center of gravity
has leaned toward that alliance,

1156
01:00:09,188 --> 01:00:11,899
so my team is now in a situation

1157
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:14,110
where we have no choice but to be careful.

1158
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:17,405
Halloween Monster will now begin.

1159
01:00:17,488 --> 01:00:21,492
First, you will all be provided a Dagger,
the basic weapon card.

1160
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:23,995
Dagger.

1161
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:27,832
Round 1 will now begin.

1162
01:00:27,915 --> 01:00:32,003
Currently, all players have
five victory points.

1163
01:00:32,086 --> 01:00:34,964
You now have 20 minutes

1164
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:38,509
to go to the dealer room
to transfer any points.

1165
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:42,722
-It's better to be in a room, right?
-Yes.

1166
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:48,019
-It's important to get a good start.
-Yes.

1167
01:00:48,102 --> 01:00:51,314
If we can't achieve anything
in the first two rounds,

1168
01:00:51,397 --> 01:00:52,482
we're done for.

1169
01:00:55,443 --> 01:00:57,028
We're formulating our strategy.

1170
01:00:57,111 --> 01:00:59,864
Oh, then are we not
sharing any information at all?

1171
01:00:59,947 --> 01:01:01,282
What's up?

1172
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:04,827
Because that was what the three of us
assumed when we made our strategy.

1173
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:06,704
But if you're not going
to share any information,

1174
01:01:06,788 --> 01:01:08,998
then we have to strategize accordingly.

1175
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:11,125
But we're an alliance of two.

1176
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:13,586
-Just with them?
-Yes.

1177
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:15,672
Tinno, are we playing as a nine?
No, right?

1178
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:17,173
I'm here to talk about that.

1179
01:01:17,256 --> 01:01:18,758
Didn't we agree to play as a nine?

1180
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:21,219
I need to talk with him.
Hyun-gyu, can you come out?

1181
01:01:21,302 --> 01:01:23,096
Weren't the nine of us playing as one?

1182
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:24,597
I have no idea.

1183
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:27,141
I just focused
on the three of us as my priority.

1184
01:01:27,225 --> 01:01:29,560
Are you set in stone about six?
You're not for nine?

1185
01:01:29,644 --> 01:01:31,396
Yes, it's impossible to win with nine.

1186
01:01:31,479 --> 01:01:34,649
Then let's go with six,
and I'll tell the others.

1187
01:01:34,732 --> 01:01:37,443
Hey, 7high, Ji-yeong. I'm really sorry.

1188
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:40,071
You should have told us
before we formed an alliance.

1189
01:01:40,154 --> 01:01:41,364
But the thing is,

1190
01:01:41,447 --> 01:01:43,700
we were originally
thinking of all nine of us.

1191
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:46,119
I wanted to work together,
but Hyun-gyu said no.

1192
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:48,746
So we have the choice.
Six with you, or six with them.

1193
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:51,874
But I think we have no choice
but to go with them.

1194
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:53,501
What do you mean you have no choice?

1195
01:01:53,584 --> 01:01:54,961
One of them will come out on top.

1196
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:57,422
-Definitely. They'll win.
-So?

1197
01:01:57,505 --> 01:01:59,382
So we'll make them use
as many Pieces as possible.

1198
01:01:59,465 --> 01:02:02,385
And we've already decided
Se-dol will be the one to go.

1199
01:02:02,468 --> 01:02:03,970
I can tell you that much.

1200
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:05,430
We have no power right now.

1201
01:02:05,513 --> 01:02:08,099
-That's true.
-They have the upper hand.

1202
01:02:08,182 --> 01:02:11,269
Once you form an alliance,
it can't be broken.

1203
01:02:11,352 --> 01:02:13,521
So when they just said that
out of the blue,

1204
01:02:13,604 --> 01:02:15,648
I thought,
"They're betraying us so easily."

1205
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:17,024
What I'm trying to say is,

1206
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:20,319
if you had said
that you decided to go as a six…

1207
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:22,113
-Let's get out of here.
-We need to calculate this.

1208
01:02:22,196 --> 01:02:24,323
…we wouldn't have made
an alliance like this.

1209
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:25,450
Anyhow…

1210
01:02:26,784 --> 01:02:29,287
-You know what I'm saying?
-I know what you mean.

1211
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:34,292
What's done is done.

1212
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:38,171
All we can do is try and defend ourselves
as much as possible.

1213
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:41,466
I think they'll use a Piece
in the first round for sure.

1214
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:43,760
If they get the Witch,
they get their Piece back.

1215
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:47,180
So I think they'll set themselves up
to take the Witch.

1216
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:49,515
I'll use one too. I'll do it.

1217
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,894
Let's get a Change the Order card
and use it to get the Witch.

1218
01:02:52,977 --> 01:02:53,978
So, what…

1219
01:02:54,061 --> 01:02:55,062
We're talking. Just a sec.

1220
01:02:55,146 --> 01:02:57,940
The others just came in kicking up a fuss.

1221
01:02:58,024 --> 01:02:59,942
Asking us why we aren't working with them.

1222
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:01,110
So what's your plan?

1223
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:03,863
For this round,
let's focus on getting the Dracula.

1224
01:03:03,946 --> 01:03:05,740
Where's the Dracula? This?

1225
01:03:05,823 --> 01:03:07,658
The one that comes out
after we clear the Jack?

1226
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:09,327
The Piece is attractive,

1227
01:03:09,410 --> 01:03:11,078
so I think they'll go for that,

1228
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:13,122
so let's just hit No. 1.

1229
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:15,541
So let's go with two players with 13
and four with one each.

1230
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:18,377
I'm creating a strategy
to divide into the front and the end.

1231
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:21,380
The two at the front
will go for the Jack-o'-lantern,

1232
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:23,966
and we'll try to position our four
at the very end

1233
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:27,428
in order to consecutively hit the Dracula,

1234
01:03:27,512 --> 01:03:28,846
thus getting both monsters.

1235
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:31,933
If they go for 13 just like us,
will you use a Piece then?

1236
01:03:32,016 --> 01:03:34,519
If they send someone with 13,

1237
01:03:34,602 --> 01:03:37,605
the order in which we go
will be decided by drawing lots.

1238
01:03:37,688 --> 01:03:39,732
As long as they're not second, it's fine.

1239
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:41,484
As long as they're not in the middle.

1240
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:43,653
If they go in the middle,

1241
01:03:43,736 --> 01:03:45,863
-their attack could steal it?
-Yes.

1242
01:03:45,947 --> 01:03:48,783
If that happens, we can't strike first
or they'll get the Jack.

1243
01:03:48,866 --> 01:03:51,744
That's just down to chance.
It's not something we can control.

1244
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:52,870
Let's go with this for now.

1245
01:03:52,954 --> 01:03:54,539
-Go with 13.
-We'll go and transfer points.

1246
01:03:56,582 --> 01:03:58,501
-Hello.
-Hello.

1247
01:03:58,584 --> 01:04:00,545
-Do you want to transfer points?
-Yes.

1248
01:04:00,628 --> 01:04:02,421
How many points
will be transferred to whom?

1249
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:04,298
We'd like to go with 13, 1, and 1.

1250
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:06,676
Oh, 13 going to him is better.

1251
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:10,972
Take good care of your Dagger.
If you lose it, that's it.

1252
01:04:11,722 --> 01:04:12,849
You left it behind.

1253
01:04:12,932 --> 01:04:13,850
Oh, shit.

1254
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:15,601
Forgetting my sword to war.

1255
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:17,770
We will change to 13, 1, and 1.

1256
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:20,231
-Transfer has been confirmed.
-Thank you.

1257
01:04:20,314 --> 01:04:23,317
You have five minutes
for transferring points.

1258
01:04:23,401 --> 01:04:25,361
We can't transfer any even if we want to.

1259
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:29,198
We just have to decide what to attack.

1260
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:32,451
Won't it be fine if we just win one?

1261
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:35,037
If we can kill a monster
in the first two rounds,

1262
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:36,330
that'd be amazing.

1263
01:04:36,914 --> 01:04:39,417
A solo player isn't necessarily
at a disadvantage

1264
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:41,252
compared to a 3-person alliance.

1265
01:04:41,335 --> 01:04:44,088
In the end, a 3-person alliance
has to split their points

1266
01:04:44,171 --> 01:04:46,549
equally among all three players,

1267
01:04:46,632 --> 01:04:48,718
so a 3-person alliance

1268
01:04:48,801 --> 01:04:53,097
needs three times as many points
as a solo player.

1269
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:56,058
The time for transferring points
is now up.

1270
01:04:57,268 --> 01:04:58,477
Do we have to go and do it?

1271
01:04:58,561 --> 01:05:00,354
It's over. We're stuck with five each.

1272
01:05:03,316 --> 01:05:04,567
So that's how it goes.

1273
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:07,361
We spent a lot of time
discussing how to divide our points

1274
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:10,114
and ended up
being stuck with three 5s. But…

1275
01:05:10,197 --> 01:05:12,742
However the order is decided,
we'll be somewhere in the middle.

1276
01:05:12,825 --> 01:05:15,077
It's not bad.
Though it's not something we planned.

1277
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:17,496
Players with the same score

1278
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:21,000
will now draw lots to decide their order.

1279
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:24,378
Kyuhyun, Choi Hyun-joon,
please draw a ball.

1280
01:05:24,462 --> 01:05:25,755
Okay.

1281
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:33,971
Number five.

1282
01:05:35,222 --> 01:05:36,641
It's meaningless for us.

1283
01:05:38,517 --> 01:05:41,771
Here is the order of attack for Round 1.

1284
01:05:41,854 --> 01:05:44,732
For the next 30 minutes,

1285
01:05:44,815 --> 01:05:48,986
you may proceed with informing the dealer
of your choice of weapon and target.

1286
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:51,238
-Okay, we need to decide.
-Let's talk. Yes.

1287
01:05:52,406 --> 01:05:54,492
They've pushed two forward with 13.

1288
01:05:54,575 --> 01:05:57,495
But the three that are all 5
didn't change anything.

1289
01:05:57,578 --> 01:06:00,247
Why is that? When they're a team of three?

1290
01:06:00,331 --> 01:06:02,291
-We got the Jack.
-Yep, we did.

1291
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:05,127
If we go like this,
they won't go for the witch.

1292
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:06,420
-They won't.
-Right?

1293
01:06:06,504 --> 01:06:08,631
It bothers me that Se-dol is in the front.

1294
01:06:08,714 --> 01:06:11,050
I'm curious what Se-dol is going for.

1295
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:13,260
But what's weird about this is that

1296
01:06:13,344 --> 01:06:16,222
-it feels like they're aiming for this.
-Yes, it does.

1297
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:18,057
They're definitely getting the Jack.

1298
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:21,435
So, that will drop out,
and the Dracula comes into play.

1299
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:26,691
Then here they have one, two, three.

1300
01:06:26,774 --> 01:06:29,026
That makes exactly nine points.

1301
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:31,529
So they'll go for this. Nine points.

1302
01:06:31,612 --> 01:06:34,490
If I hit it, it's six.
And if she hits it, it's out.

1303
01:06:34,573 --> 01:06:35,700
The Treant dies.

1304
01:06:35,783 --> 01:06:38,869
-Then the Werewolf…
-It'll come out.

1305
01:06:38,953 --> 01:06:41,831
It'll be dead, but 7high won't know that,
so he'll hit it again.

1306
01:06:41,914 --> 01:06:44,458
And if you hit it again after that,

1307
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:46,002
you get it.

1308
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:47,128
That's what'll happen.

1309
01:06:47,211 --> 01:06:48,754
Best-case scenario.

1310
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:50,548
That's the best case, but…

1311
01:06:50,631 --> 01:06:51,757
Okay.

1312
01:06:53,175 --> 01:06:55,386
Please say the battlefield number
you'd like to attack

1313
01:06:55,469 --> 01:06:56,929
and present your weapon.

1314
01:06:57,555 --> 01:06:59,557
I will attack Battlefield No. 1.

1315
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:01,642
Battlefield No. 1 with a Dagger.

1316
01:07:01,726 --> 01:07:03,310
Battlefield No. 1 with the Dagger.

1317
01:07:03,394 --> 01:07:05,021
Yes, with my Dagger.

1318
01:07:05,104 --> 01:07:06,313
No. 1 with the Dagger.

1319
01:07:06,397 --> 01:07:08,315
Battlefield No. 1 with the Dagger.

1320
01:07:08,399 --> 01:07:10,026
I will attack No. 1 with my Dagger.

1321
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:12,069
I will attack No. 1.

1322
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:15,948
Then after that, if you get the Grenade…

1323
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:17,033
Of course.

1324
01:07:17,116 --> 01:07:20,828
…then give me the Grenade,
which would give me six attack points.

1325
01:07:20,911 --> 01:07:23,831
We can think about using that
to get something else.

1326
01:07:23,914 --> 01:07:27,334
On Battlefield No. 2,
I will use my Dagger.

1327
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:30,379
Yes, I will use my Dagger
on Battlefield No. 2.

1328
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:34,133
As I said, Kyuhyun and Hyun-joon
are going for the Jack-o'-lantern.

1329
01:07:34,216 --> 01:07:35,051
Just that one.

1330
01:07:35,134 --> 01:07:37,511
-Yes.
-So how about we go for the Treant?

1331
01:07:37,595 --> 01:07:39,346
I'm saying let's go for the Treant.

1332
01:07:45,644 --> 01:07:47,813
All three of you go for No. 2.

1333
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:48,981
Why?

1334
01:07:50,024 --> 01:07:52,568
Then you're bound to get the Treant.

1335
01:07:54,695 --> 01:07:58,616
I told 7high's team to go for No. 2
because I didn't want them

1336
01:07:58,699 --> 01:08:00,785
dealing damage on weird spots.

1337
01:08:00,868 --> 01:08:03,370
Besides,
it wasn't going to hurt us that much.

1338
01:08:03,454 --> 01:08:05,956
They're definitely going for the Jack.
So, that's gone.

1339
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:07,583
And if we go all in on No. 2,

1340
01:08:07,666 --> 01:08:10,002
it doesn't matter what Se-dol does,
he can't collect anything.

1341
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:11,879
So if we hit No. 2 three times,

1342
01:08:11,962 --> 01:08:15,591
they will think we're cooperating
with them, and it's good for us.

1343
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:20,513
If we'd have done this,
we could have taken this.

1344
01:08:20,596 --> 01:08:23,682
If the five of us combined together,
we could have had the Witch.

1345
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:25,434
That would have been worth a shot.

1346
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:27,269
Of course, that's if they'd agree.

1347
01:08:27,353 --> 01:08:28,562
It's hard to tell.

1348
01:08:28,646 --> 01:08:30,689
-If they could've had it, they would have.
-Yes.

1349
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:34,443
But it would have gone to us,
so it wouldn't have worked.

1350
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:37,446
And you know what they're like.
"If you get that,

1351
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:40,407
you have to do something for us,
or give us a Piece."

1352
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:42,535
Things would've gotten complicated.

1353
01:08:42,618 --> 01:08:46,372
You have five minutes remaining
to choose your weapon and target.

1354
01:08:48,707 --> 01:08:50,251
I will go for Battlefield No. 2.

1355
01:08:50,334 --> 01:08:51,836
-No. 2.
-No. 2.

1356
01:08:51,919 --> 01:08:54,213
-Your Dagger on Battlefield No. 2.
-Yes.

1357
01:08:54,296 --> 01:08:57,716
Apparently, it was different for them.
What was it called?

1358
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,510
-What was different? Oh, the mission?
-Yes.

1359
01:08:59,593 --> 01:09:01,554
It was something beyond human imagination.

1360
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:03,472
Since you've cleared it, it's over, right?

1361
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:05,432
-Yes, it's done now.
-Closed off.

1362
01:09:05,516 --> 01:09:07,476
You two should have swapped
and given it a go.

1363
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:08,727
He played Wall Go.

1364
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:09,895
Actually, it wasn't Wall Go.

1365
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:11,272
Oh, what the heck?

1366
01:09:11,355 --> 01:09:13,482
Did you have to move on a chessboard

1367
01:09:13,566 --> 01:09:15,109
-like you were the chess piece?
-Right.

1368
01:09:15,192 --> 01:09:16,777
So it was the Knight's Tour.

1369
01:09:16,861 --> 01:09:19,697
It's obvious why he told me
he played Wall Go.

1370
01:09:19,780 --> 01:09:22,158
He did something similar
to the Knight's Tour,

1371
01:09:22,241 --> 01:09:24,535
but he told me he played Wall Go

1372
01:09:24,618 --> 01:09:27,872
so that we'd waste more time
doing the Knight's Tour

1373
01:09:27,955 --> 01:09:32,293
while he'd be the only one to know
Wall Go would come out at some point.

1374
01:09:32,376 --> 01:09:34,628
I could see through him.

1375
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:36,672
Your time is up.

1376
01:09:36,755 --> 01:09:39,049
Please gather in the hall.

1377
01:09:39,133 --> 01:09:40,551
Let me win one!

1378
01:09:40,634 --> 01:09:41,468
What happened?

1379
01:09:41,552 --> 01:09:46,140
Here are the results
of all attacks being applied in order.

1380
01:09:46,223 --> 01:09:48,809
The Jack-o'-lantern on Battlefield No. 1

1381
01:09:48,893 --> 01:09:51,478
was killed by Choi Hyun-joon.

1382
01:09:51,562 --> 01:09:52,897
-As expected.
-Hyun-joon got it?

1383
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:55,900
You are awarded five points
and the Poison.

1384
01:09:57,276 --> 01:10:02,072
The Treant on Battlefield No. 2
was killed by Kang Ji-yeong.

1385
01:10:02,615 --> 01:10:05,409
-You're awarded nine points, the Grenade…
-Thank you.

1386
01:10:05,492 --> 01:10:07,036
…and the Dual Swords.

1387
01:10:08,412 --> 01:10:11,040
The Werewolf on Battlefield No. 2

1388
01:10:12,124 --> 01:10:14,585
was killed by Justin Min.

1389
01:10:14,668 --> 01:10:17,922
You are awarded five points
and the Grenade.

1390
01:10:18,005 --> 01:10:20,090
-Everything happened as expected.
-Yes.

1391
01:10:20,174 --> 01:10:22,343
They've definitely joined hands.

1392
01:10:22,426 --> 01:10:25,095
The Dracula on Battlefield No. 1

1393
01:10:25,179 --> 01:10:27,640
was killed by Tinno.

1394
01:10:27,723 --> 01:10:31,143
You are awarded ten points, the Ice,
and the Dual Swords.

1395
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:32,353
Thank you!

1396
01:10:32,436 --> 01:10:34,230
My inventory is full to bursting.

1397
01:10:34,313 --> 01:10:36,357
Round 2 will now begin.

1398
01:10:37,024 --> 01:10:40,361
You have 20 minutes to go

1399
01:10:40,444 --> 01:10:43,405
to the dealer room to transfer any points.

1400
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:44,823
Did they join those two?

1401
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:46,533
-I think so.
-Ji-yeong and Justin took them.

1402
01:10:46,617 --> 01:10:48,702
I mean, they hit the Treant
three times in a row.

1403
01:10:48,786 --> 01:10:50,120
-Yes.
-They joined hands.

1404
01:10:50,204 --> 01:10:52,581
That's not it. Se-dol helped him.

1405
01:10:52,665 --> 01:10:56,001
He knew that he couldn't win
anything from position four,

1406
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:59,755
and he expected us to go for the Treant,
so he attacked it after us.

1407
01:10:59,838 --> 01:11:01,298
That means the two joined hands.

1408
01:11:01,382 --> 01:11:02,925
They really hit it.

1409
01:11:04,385 --> 01:11:05,511
We were lucky.

1410
01:11:06,387 --> 01:11:09,807
Now, Ji-yeong got the Grenade
and Dual Swords from the Treant,

1411
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:13,811
and Justin got two Grenades.

1412
01:11:13,894 --> 01:11:15,354
They'll probably go for the Witch next.

1413
01:11:15,437 --> 01:11:16,855
Yes. This is so difficult.

1414
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:19,650
-Do you want me to speak realistically?
-Yes.

1415
01:11:19,733 --> 01:11:21,527
-Should we go for something else?
-Yes.

1416
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:23,612
Then our points will be
eight, eight, eight.

1417
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:25,572
And we have to attack either one or two.

1418
01:11:25,656 --> 01:11:26,615
But the problem is,

1419
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:30,327
if we're next to one another
and another alliance comes behind us,

1420
01:11:30,411 --> 01:11:32,162
they can gobble it up like just now.

1421
01:11:32,246 --> 01:11:33,914
It'll get easy to calculate.

1422
01:11:33,998 --> 01:11:37,042
They'll easily assume
we'll all go for the same target.

1423
01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:39,712
So if they go for eight, eight, eight,

1424
01:11:39,795 --> 01:11:42,798
whether they go
for the Frankenstein or the Mummy,

1425
01:11:42,881 --> 01:11:44,591
we just need two hits in.

1426
01:11:44,675 --> 01:11:46,051
First, let's transfer points.

1427
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:47,511
Would you like to transfer points?

1428
01:11:47,594 --> 01:11:49,847
-You got one, right?
-I got the Jack-o'-lantern.

1429
01:11:49,930 --> 01:11:51,557
Then, let's do 18, 1, and 1.

1430
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:52,766
Let's go with that.

1431
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:55,436
Oh, that's how we already are.
We'll stick with that.

1432
01:11:55,519 --> 01:11:58,105
You're not sharing anything, right?

1433
01:11:58,188 --> 01:12:00,566
-No.
-You can't share anything this round.

1434
01:12:00,649 --> 01:12:03,444
I mean, they've already caught on to us.

1435
01:12:03,527 --> 01:12:07,072
I mean, once we're sure we're winning,
we can share our info

1436
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:09,825
-Right.
-but at this early stage, it's not…

1437
01:12:09,908 --> 01:12:11,201
Would you like to transfer points?

1438
01:12:11,285 --> 01:12:15,414
Yes, So-hui and Kyuhyun would like
to give all of our points to Tinno.

1439
01:12:15,497 --> 01:12:17,583
Kyuhyun can transfer 12 points to Tinno,

1440
01:12:17,666 --> 01:12:20,252
-and So-hui has no points to transfer.
-Oh, right.

1441
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:23,505
-You can't.
-Just as is. If I give it, I die.

1442
01:12:24,256 --> 01:12:25,674
Let me just ask one thing.

1443
01:12:25,758 --> 01:12:28,719
How many of you
have between 5 and 8 points?

1444
01:12:28,802 --> 01:12:30,262
Among the six of you?

1445
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:32,097
Is the plan to position up front and back?

1446
01:12:32,681 --> 01:12:34,391
-Right now, that's a bit…
-So you can't tell us.

1447
01:12:34,475 --> 01:12:35,309
No.

1448
01:12:35,392 --> 01:12:38,312
We're asking this because
we want to get away from Se-dol.

1449
01:12:38,395 --> 01:12:40,439
-Between 5 and 8 points?
-Aren't you in an alliance with him?

1450
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:42,232
What are you talking about? No way.

1451
01:12:42,316 --> 01:12:44,651
Just listen to me. Go with 8, 8, 8.

1452
01:12:44,735 --> 01:12:47,363
See, if we go with these attacks,

1453
01:12:47,446 --> 01:12:50,574
we'll end up giving ten points to Se-dol,
which we don't want to do.

1454
01:12:50,657 --> 01:12:52,284
So you don't want them going behind you.

1455
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:53,327
Hang on a second.

1456
01:12:53,410 --> 01:12:56,455
We have no choice. If we don't,
the two of them will be in a row.

1457
01:12:56,538 --> 01:12:59,541
Let's go for 8, 8, 8.
Or the two of them will be together.

1458
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:01,335
There's no one with 5 to 10 points.

1459
01:13:01,418 --> 01:13:03,462
If they all go 8 points,
that's good for us.

1460
01:13:03,545 --> 01:13:05,172
Exactly, so it's okay to tell them.

1461
01:13:05,255 --> 01:13:07,549
-Yes, that's why I told them.
-Yes, right.

1462
01:13:07,633 --> 01:13:10,010
Hey, I've got some info.
They didn't join hands.

1463
01:13:10,094 --> 01:13:12,221
What's certain is that
they've started using us.

1464
01:13:12,304 --> 01:13:14,431
They now know that
we don't want the solos to take any.

1465
01:13:14,515 --> 01:13:17,267
They thought they had no choice
but to keep us in check,

1466
01:13:17,351 --> 01:13:19,353
so they tried to control us
at the front and end.

1467
01:13:19,436 --> 01:13:22,272
The time for transferring points
is now up.

1468
01:13:22,356 --> 01:13:25,484
Here is the order of attack for Round 2.

1469
01:13:25,567 --> 01:13:27,027
What would Tinno go for?

1470
01:13:27,111 --> 01:13:29,071
Judging by the items,
he'll go for the Mummy.

1471
01:13:29,154 --> 01:13:30,155
The Mummy?

1472
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:32,408
Or maybe he'll use the Ice
to hold it down.

1473
01:13:32,491 --> 01:13:34,243
I can't tell how they'll use the Ice.

1474
01:13:34,326 --> 01:13:36,662
And the Poison is also a headache.

1475
01:13:36,745 --> 01:13:40,624
It might even be good for another team,
as it drops by one each turn.

1476
01:13:40,707 --> 01:13:41,750
Yes, you're right.

1477
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:43,419
He might not use Poison at all.

1478
01:13:43,502 --> 01:13:45,504
The same goes for the Ice.

1479
01:13:45,587 --> 01:13:47,673
I think they'll go
for the Witch this round.

1480
01:13:47,756 --> 01:13:48,966
Going for the Witch?

1481
01:13:49,049 --> 01:13:50,300
Yeah, but I think

1482
01:13:50,384 --> 01:13:52,052
they would attack it once early on

1483
01:13:52,136 --> 01:13:54,304
and then hit it four times in a row
at the end,

1484
01:13:54,388 --> 01:13:56,348
because they think
no one else will go for it.

1485
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:58,934
But however we arrange ourselves,
we can't get the Witch.

1486
01:13:59,017 --> 01:14:01,854
-There is one way.
-Yes, I'm thinking the same thing.

1487
01:14:01,937 --> 01:14:04,106
-Justin.
-With Justin. Not Se-dol.

1488
01:14:04,189 --> 01:14:06,567
Yes, we join hands with Justin.

1489
01:14:06,650 --> 01:14:08,944
-But what does Justin gain by helping us?
-Right.

1490
01:14:09,027 --> 01:14:11,363
Regardless of alliance, we're allowed to

1491
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:13,699
-transfer weapons.
-Just give him the Dynamite?

1492
01:14:15,909 --> 01:14:17,703
I guess that's what that means.

1493
01:14:17,786 --> 01:14:20,372
-Can we talk for a bit?
-Sure, come in. Please do.

1494
01:14:26,336 --> 01:14:28,297
If these two go for the Mummy,

1495
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:31,091
-you three can easily get Frankenstein.
-Yes, we know that.

1496
01:14:31,175 --> 01:14:32,009
To be honest…

1497
01:14:39,808 --> 01:14:41,351
If we take this…

1498
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:47,983
-Oh, you want him to hit it.
-Attack it just once.

1499
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:52,112
We're capable of hitting 6, 3, 3,
for a total of 12.

1500
01:14:52,196 --> 01:14:54,656
If you can hit it for 3,
we can get the Witch.

1501
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:57,951
I think that's the only way
we can shake up the game.

1502
01:14:58,035 --> 01:15:01,872
Well, I normally really hate this
kind of thing, but give us a Piece.

1503
01:15:01,955 --> 01:15:03,415
-Not the Dynamite?
-Yes.

1504
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:05,459
In fact, we can't transfer Pieces here,

1505
01:15:05,542 --> 01:15:07,794
but later when we get back after the game,

1506
01:15:07,878 --> 01:15:09,338
you can give it to us then.

1507
01:15:09,421 --> 01:15:11,298
I will discuss it
with the rest of my team.

1508
01:15:15,844 --> 01:15:19,139
But, just momentarily,
this thought crossed my mind.

1509
01:15:19,223 --> 01:15:20,390
"What if they don't give it to us?"

1510
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:24,686
When I offered the Dynamite,
they asked for a Piece.

1511
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:26,063
That's their condition.

1512
01:15:26,146 --> 01:15:27,272
They want a Piece?

1513
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:30,567
You have ten minutes
to select your target and weapon.

1514
01:15:31,068 --> 01:15:32,444
Let's go and make our attacks.

1515
01:15:37,658 --> 01:15:40,577
Please tell me the number of
your target and your weapon of choice.

1516
01:15:40,661 --> 01:15:41,745
No. 2.

1517
01:15:42,246 --> 01:15:43,413
I will use my Dagger.

1518
01:15:43,497 --> 01:15:45,999
You have used your Dagger
on Battlefield No. 2.

1519
01:15:47,834 --> 01:15:50,837
I just thought of something worse.

1520
01:15:50,921 --> 01:15:54,216
What if we all attack the Witch,
but Justin doesn't? What do we do then?

1521
01:15:54,299 --> 01:15:55,509
Then Se-dol can collect it.

1522
01:15:55,592 --> 01:15:59,555
Justin could ally with Se-dol,
and Se-dol ends up getting the Witch.

1523
01:15:59,638 --> 01:16:01,348
We should've never proposed it.

1524
01:16:01,431 --> 01:16:03,308
We've revealed our hand.

1525
01:16:03,392 --> 01:16:06,019
Well, it's not really of my concern,

1526
01:16:06,103 --> 01:16:09,940
but if we don't do what they want,
what will they do then?

1527
01:16:10,023 --> 01:16:12,609
Since he hasn't come back,
I guess the deal's off.

1528
01:16:12,693 --> 01:16:14,152
Never mind then.

1529
01:16:14,236 --> 01:16:16,238
-We'll go for one and you go for two.
-I'll do two.

1530
01:16:16,321 --> 01:16:17,739
We're betting on it.

1531
01:16:17,823 --> 01:16:19,700
If we fail, we're going home.

1532
01:16:19,783 --> 01:16:21,410
-One, one, two.
-Okay.

1533
01:16:21,493 --> 01:16:24,454
I will attack Battlefield No. 2
with my Dagger.

1534
01:16:24,538 --> 01:16:25,706
No. 1…

1535
01:16:25,789 --> 01:16:27,791
I will use this on No. 1.

1536
01:16:27,874 --> 01:16:30,919
The Ice is so…
It's so difficult to predict.

1537
01:16:31,003 --> 01:16:33,297
I'm feeling the bitter taste
of capitalism.

1538
01:16:33,380 --> 01:16:34,965
-The bitter taste of capitalism?
-Yes.

1539
01:16:35,048 --> 01:16:36,508
Like we're in different classes.

1540
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:39,553
I'm most worried about you right now.

1541
01:16:39,636 --> 01:16:42,264
Because I think you're really valuable.

1542
01:16:42,347 --> 01:16:43,432
-Me too.
-Yes.

1543
01:16:43,515 --> 01:16:47,686
But to be honest,
I'm only asking because I'm not sure.

1544
01:16:50,147 --> 01:16:51,690
Is that the same dress?

1545
01:16:51,773 --> 01:16:52,649
-Me?
-Yes.

1546
01:16:52,733 --> 01:16:56,069
Yes, I've been wearing this
for three days now.

1547
01:16:56,153 --> 01:16:58,614
I thought perhaps the color was
slightly different.

1548
01:16:58,697 --> 01:17:00,365
Maybe brighter red or pink.

1549
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:03,076
It's scary, having the same dress
in different colors.

1550
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:04,244
I wasn't sure.

1551
01:17:04,328 --> 01:17:08,498
All players have now finished
selecting their weapons and targets.

1552
01:17:09,082 --> 01:17:13,754
Here are the results of
all attacks being applied in order.

1553
01:17:18,550 --> 01:17:20,510
The Witch on Battlefield No. 3…

1554
01:17:20,594 --> 01:17:22,763
WITCH

1555
01:17:22,846 --> 01:17:25,140
…was killed by Jeong Hyun-gyu.

1556
01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:29,353
Let's try to predict what they will do.

1557
01:17:29,436 --> 01:17:32,064
And how about we throw the Poison
at the Witch?

1558
01:17:34,066 --> 01:17:38,445
What they can do is
target the Mummy or the Frankenstein.

1559
01:17:38,528 --> 01:17:40,572
Maybe we should freeze the Frankenstein.

1560
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:43,992
That's a good plan.
I don't think they'd go for the Witch.

1561
01:17:44,743 --> 01:17:46,328
If we use the Poison,

1562
01:17:46,411 --> 01:17:50,165
if they want to nab our poisoned monster,

1563
01:17:50,248 --> 01:17:53,669
they would have to
use everything they have.

1564
01:17:53,752 --> 01:17:56,922
Going all-in like that is
very difficult for them to commit to.

1565
01:17:57,005 --> 01:17:58,882
The one going first uses the Poison,

1566
01:17:58,965 --> 01:18:01,510
and the two going last
will strike the Witch.

1567
01:18:01,593 --> 01:18:03,220
Poison on Battlefield No. 3.

1568
01:18:03,303 --> 01:18:05,180
I will freeze the Frankenstein.

1569
01:18:05,263 --> 01:18:08,058
Dagger on No. 3.

1570
01:18:08,141 --> 01:18:09,851
I will use this on No. 1.

1571
01:18:09,935 --> 01:18:12,688
I'll use my Dagger on No. 1.

1572
01:18:12,771 --> 01:18:15,899
I will attack Battlefield No. 2
with my Dagger.

1573
01:18:15,982 --> 01:18:18,068
I will attack No. 3 with my Dagger.

1574
01:18:18,151 --> 01:18:20,946
I will attack Battlefield No. 3
with my Dagger.

1575
01:18:21,029 --> 01:18:24,866
I will attack Battlefield No. 2
with my Dagger.

1576
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:26,910
-With my Dagger.
-On Battlefield No. 3…

1577
01:18:26,993 --> 01:18:29,579
I will attack Battlefield No. 2.

1578
01:18:29,663 --> 01:18:32,332
-Dagger on Battlefield No. 2.
-Yes.

1579
01:18:32,416 --> 01:18:37,254
You will be awarded
15 points, a Piece, and the Dynamite.

1580
01:18:42,801 --> 01:18:45,303
The Mummy on Battlefield No. 2

1581
01:18:45,387 --> 01:18:47,514
was killed by Kyuhyun.

1582
01:18:47,597 --> 01:18:51,768
You are awarded seven points,
the Grenade and the Poison.

1583
01:18:51,852 --> 01:18:53,103
-Best-case scenario.
-Amazing.

1584
01:18:53,186 --> 01:18:54,312
Okay, okay.

1585
01:18:54,896 --> 01:18:57,190
Round 3 will now begin.

1586
01:18:59,067 --> 01:19:00,527
The Grim Reaper's been revealed.

1587
01:19:00,610 --> 01:19:02,028
Its loot is two Pieces.

1588
01:19:02,612 --> 01:19:04,322
GRIM REAPER

1589
01:19:04,406 --> 01:19:06,158
You now have 20 minutes
to go to the dealer room…

1590
01:19:06,241 --> 01:19:08,452
-So it wasn't stealing Pieces.
-What?

1591
01:19:08,535 --> 01:19:09,995
It's two Pieces.

1592
01:19:10,078 --> 01:19:11,163
There's no elimination?

1593
01:19:11,246 --> 01:19:13,373
The loot for the Grim Reaper
is two Pieces.

1594
01:19:13,457 --> 01:19:15,959
Then the condition for being eliminated
is something else.

1595
01:19:16,042 --> 01:19:18,712
My guess was that
when the reaper was revealed,

1596
01:19:18,795 --> 01:19:22,966
the loot would be taking Pieces
off whichever player you want,

1597
01:19:23,049 --> 01:19:26,636
but when it was revealed,
the reward turned out to be two Pieces.

1598
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:28,472
That means it's not the Grim Reaper.

1599
01:19:28,555 --> 01:19:31,475
The way to eliminate a person
hasn't come out.

1600
01:19:31,558 --> 01:19:33,602
GRIM REAPER

1601
01:19:33,685 --> 01:19:35,896
Just tell me one thing.
Did you attack No. 1?

1602
01:19:35,979 --> 01:19:37,397
Did you attack the Frankenstein?

1603
01:19:37,481 --> 01:19:39,816
Did we attack the Frankenstein?
With an item?

1604
01:19:41,109 --> 01:19:42,194
Did you freeze it?

1605
01:19:42,277 --> 01:19:44,696
-We had no reason to do anything to it.
-Exactly.

1606
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:47,866
That's why I'm asking. I'm just checking.
It's so freaking important to us.

1607
01:19:47,949 --> 01:19:49,868
But how can I tell you that?

1608
01:19:49,951 --> 01:19:51,995
-I can't tell you that right now.
-So you did?

1609
01:19:52,078 --> 01:19:53,872
I can't tell you anything at all.

1610
01:19:55,165 --> 01:19:56,458
They froze the Frankenstein.

1611
01:19:56,541 --> 01:19:58,043
Exactly as I expected.

1612
01:19:58,126 --> 01:19:59,669
-They used the Ice?
-I'm sure of it.

1613
01:19:59,753 --> 01:20:01,505
Nothing we did had any effect.

1614
01:20:01,588 --> 01:20:04,216
-They say it was the best-case scenario.
-Exactly.

1615
01:20:05,550 --> 01:20:08,470
We have the Poison, Grenade,
Dynamite, and Dual Swords.

1616
01:20:08,553 --> 01:20:10,514
And the Ice on the Frankenstein
will melt now.

1617
01:20:10,597 --> 01:20:13,558
Hyun-joon, the Ice loses its effect
as soon as you go in, right?

1618
01:20:13,642 --> 01:20:17,145
Yes, then shall our first two players
go after the Frankenstein?

1619
01:20:17,229 --> 01:20:20,982
Yes. Then it has 6 health points left.
If we use the Grenade, we can get it.

1620
01:20:21,066 --> 01:20:22,234
Then you can go first,

1621
01:20:22,317 --> 01:20:24,653
melt the Ice
and use the Poison on the Zombie.

1622
01:20:24,736 --> 01:20:27,697
Then So-hui can use the Grenade
to get No. 1,

1623
01:20:27,781 --> 01:20:29,950
and the rest of us will mop up the Zombie.

1624
01:20:30,033 --> 01:20:31,618
But I'm not sure about something.

1625
01:20:31,701 --> 01:20:35,163
They know we're going to be
taking the first two turns.

1626
01:20:35,247 --> 01:20:36,456
And they also have the Grenade.

1627
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:37,707
But we're first and second.

1628
01:20:37,791 --> 01:20:39,584
But they could use a Piece
to change the order.

1629
01:20:39,668 --> 01:20:40,544
You're right.

1630
01:20:40,627 --> 01:20:44,381
Let them use it. Then we can spend some
in the next round.

1631
01:20:44,464 --> 01:20:46,967
But would they really use
a Piece and a Grenade

1632
01:20:47,050 --> 01:20:48,260
to get one monster?

1633
01:20:48,343 --> 01:20:49,427
Are they that bold?

1634
01:20:49,511 --> 01:20:52,305
Well, no, I don't think they will.

1635
01:20:52,389 --> 01:20:54,224
Then let's decide how we'll divide points.

1636
01:20:54,307 --> 01:20:56,935
-Can't we go in whichever order we want?
-Yes.

1637
01:20:57,018 --> 01:20:58,395
Our numbers are way bigger now.

1638
01:20:58,478 --> 01:21:01,106
We do. That's why we can
definitely get the first and last.

1639
01:21:01,189 --> 01:21:02,566
It's better to be at the back
because of the Poison.

1640
01:21:02,649 --> 01:21:06,903
It's 30, 3, 2 now, so you only need 29.
For whoever that goes first on your team.

1641
01:21:06,987 --> 01:21:08,405
-So, 29, 2, and 1?
-Yes.

1642
01:21:08,488 --> 01:21:09,990
And we'll try to take the Zombie.

1643
01:21:10,073 --> 01:21:12,742
The Zombie
probably isn't at 13 points now.

1644
01:21:12,826 --> 01:21:13,869
Earlier the Witch was No. 3.

1645
01:21:13,952 --> 01:21:16,037
They would have dealt extra on the Witch.

1646
01:21:16,121 --> 01:21:18,665
The Zombie would have sustained
some damage.

1647
01:21:18,748 --> 01:21:21,918
You have five minutes
for transferring points.

1648
01:21:22,002 --> 01:21:23,295
What do we do about points?

1649
01:21:23,378 --> 01:21:25,422
See here. As 7high said earlier,

1650
01:21:25,505 --> 01:21:27,591
if Justin's between us,
it's not good for us.

1651
01:21:27,674 --> 01:21:30,302
Because if we play in a row,
there's a chance we could get it,

1652
01:21:30,385 --> 01:21:33,597
but if Justin's between us,
he could get it instead.

1653
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:36,933
-Let's stay like this.
-I don't like it but it's better.

1654
01:21:37,017 --> 01:21:39,519
Kim Ha-rin, 2 points.
Jeong Hyun-gyu, 3 points.

1655
01:21:39,603 --> 01:21:42,147
Choi Hyun-joon, 30 points.
Is that correct?

1656
01:21:42,230 --> 01:21:46,359
Yoon So-hui, 29 points,
then 2 for Kyuhyun, and 1 for me.

1657
01:21:46,443 --> 01:21:49,070
The time for transferring points
is now up.

1658
01:21:49,154 --> 01:21:52,407
Here is the order of attack for Round 3.

1659
01:21:52,490 --> 01:21:55,243
You now have 30 minutes

1660
01:21:55,327 --> 01:21:58,955
to go to the dealer room
and choose your weapon and target.

1661
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:01,666
Now when I start, the Ice on Frankenstein
has now been lifted.

1662
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:03,293
And you put the Poison on the Zombie.

1663
01:22:03,376 --> 01:22:04,544
Right, I do that.

1664
01:22:04,628 --> 01:22:07,714
Then So-hui gets the Frankenstein,
which brings the Clown into play.

1665
01:22:07,797 --> 01:22:09,215
Let's talk about that.

1666
01:22:09,299 --> 01:22:11,551
I don't think
we'll have many rounds after this,

1667
01:22:11,635 --> 01:22:12,928
so let's use the Dynamite.

1668
01:22:13,011 --> 01:22:15,764
Let's do that.
They will never expect that.

1669
01:22:15,847 --> 01:22:18,266
I will use the Poison on number three.

1670
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:21,519
I will use the Grenade
on Battlefield No. 1.

1671
01:22:21,603 --> 01:22:24,189
-The Grenade on Battlefield No. 1.
-Yes.

1672
01:22:24,272 --> 01:22:27,943
Our current assumption is
that they will go for this one

1673
01:22:28,026 --> 01:22:29,694
because they want to get another one.

1674
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:32,364
So isn't it better for us
to just go for this one?

1675
01:22:32,447 --> 01:22:33,573
Then what about them?

1676
01:22:33,657 --> 01:22:36,326
Do they have two Grenades?
Don't they just have one?

1677
01:22:36,409 --> 01:22:39,245
-Oh, this one. Right.
-They have the Dual Swords too.

1678
01:22:39,329 --> 01:22:41,915
Then they can go for the Zombie.

1679
01:22:41,998 --> 01:22:43,416
I want to go for the Zombie.

1680
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,085
Did we calculate it right just now?

1681
01:22:45,168 --> 01:22:47,921
-Kyuhyun got a card at the end.
-Yes.

1682
01:22:48,004 --> 01:22:51,132
Wait, are we sure that the Zombie
took a hit and lost some points?

1683
01:22:51,216 --> 01:22:53,718
We have to speculate
on top of speculation on everything.

1684
01:22:53,802 --> 01:22:56,846
It feels like we've got too much
unverified information.

1685
01:22:56,930 --> 01:22:59,224
We have to use our Grenade here.

1686
01:22:59,307 --> 01:23:00,850
Sure. Let's use it.

1687
01:23:00,934 --> 01:23:03,687
They can have the Frankenstein,
and we'll take the Gargoyle.

1688
01:23:03,770 --> 01:23:06,064
Finally, we've made a decision. Let's go.

1689
01:23:06,147 --> 01:23:07,941
Dagger on No. 2.

1690
01:23:08,024 --> 01:23:11,403
I will use the Grenade on No. 2.

1691
01:23:15,156 --> 01:23:16,199
Ji-yeong.

1692
01:23:17,951 --> 01:23:19,619
You've betrayed me twice now.

1693
01:23:19,703 --> 01:23:20,620
I betrayed you?

1694
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:22,789
You did. You ditched our alliance.

1695
01:23:22,872 --> 01:23:25,625
How could you do it
after we'd already formed an alliance?

1696
01:23:25,709 --> 01:23:26,751
That's not betrayal.

1697
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:30,130
We're really lonely. Honestly,
we're really playing by ourselves.

1698
01:23:31,256 --> 01:23:33,675
If we ask something,
you say you don't know or can't tell us.

1699
01:23:33,758 --> 01:23:34,968
What the heck is that?

1700
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:38,263
Ultimately, that's betrayal.

1701
01:23:41,433 --> 01:23:43,268
I will use the Grenade on No. 2.

1702
01:23:43,351 --> 01:23:46,271
I will attack Battlefield No. 2
with my Dagger.

1703
01:23:48,064 --> 01:23:50,275
-Yes, but… Right, right.
-You take it.

1704
01:23:51,651 --> 01:23:52,736
Can I come in?

1705
01:23:52,819 --> 01:23:54,738
-Yeah, come on in.
-I'm scared.

1706
01:23:57,824 --> 01:23:58,950
I'm so scared.

1707
01:24:00,076 --> 01:24:02,203
So, what is it that you guys want?

1708
01:24:02,287 --> 01:24:03,580
What we want right now?

1709
01:24:03,663 --> 01:24:06,207
Right now, this is
what we can help you with.

1710
01:24:06,291 --> 01:24:07,208
What is it?

1711
01:24:07,292 --> 01:24:09,044
If you cooperate with us,

1712
01:24:09,127 --> 01:24:11,671
we can make Se-dol and Justin
fail to get anything,

1713
01:24:11,755 --> 01:24:13,423
and give it all to your team.

1714
01:24:13,506 --> 01:24:14,841
Think it over.

1715
01:24:15,925 --> 01:24:17,552
There are no alternatives right now.

1716
01:24:17,635 --> 01:24:19,554
Then, we'll give you something next time.

1717
01:24:20,263 --> 01:24:21,306
That tone!

1718
01:24:21,389 --> 01:24:23,099
The way Hyun-gyu speaks.

1719
01:24:23,183 --> 01:24:25,602
However, you have to forfeit the item.

1720
01:24:26,644 --> 01:24:28,438
You'll only give us the points?

1721
01:24:28,521 --> 01:24:31,149
Since 7high and Ji-yeong are on that team,

1722
01:24:31,232 --> 01:24:35,236
giving them the Clown and making them
come in third is a good deal for us.

1723
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:37,030
-After this round.
-Talk with them.

1724
01:24:37,113 --> 01:24:39,449
-We'll see what happens this round.
-Okay, okay.

1725
01:24:39,532 --> 01:24:42,368
They'll give us the points,
but we have to let them have the weapon.

1726
01:24:42,452 --> 01:24:44,913
And they're talking
about giving us the Clown.

1727
01:24:44,996 --> 01:24:46,581
They wanted to take all the Pieces.

1728
01:24:46,664 --> 01:24:49,793
-They're worried that we might take one.
-Yes, they don't like it.

1729
01:24:49,876 --> 01:24:51,628
Time is up.

1730
01:24:51,711 --> 01:24:53,463
Everyone, please gather in the hall.

1731
01:24:53,546 --> 01:24:56,382
What do you think happened?
Do you think they got the Zombie?

1732
01:24:56,466 --> 01:25:01,012
Here are the results of
all attacks being applied in order.

1733
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:03,765
The Frankenstein on Battlefield No. 1

1734
01:25:03,848 --> 01:25:06,017
was killed by Yoon So-hui.

1735
01:25:07,811 --> 01:25:10,313
You are awarded nine points, the Dynamite…

1736
01:25:10,396 --> 01:25:12,607
-That worked out.
-…and Dual Swords.

1737
01:25:12,690 --> 01:25:14,192
I wonder who got the Zombie.

1738
01:25:14,275 --> 01:25:16,444
The Gargoyle on Battlefield No. 2…

1739
01:25:18,822 --> 01:25:21,241
…was killed by Kang Ji-yeong.

1740
01:25:23,034 --> 01:25:26,704
You are awarded nine points
and the Dynamite.

1741
01:25:26,788 --> 01:25:27,872
Good job.

1742
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:30,542
If I hit No. 3, I think
either Ji-yeong or I will get the Zombie.

1743
01:25:30,625 --> 01:25:32,961
What do you think?
Shall we go for the Zombie?

1744
01:25:33,044 --> 01:25:35,130
We thought the Zombie
would have 7 or 10 points left,

1745
01:25:35,213 --> 01:25:37,507
so we were thinking of going for it.

1746
01:25:37,590 --> 01:25:39,509
But someone ahead of us might get it.

1747
01:25:39,592 --> 01:25:40,468
Then let's do this.

1748
01:25:40,552 --> 01:25:43,763
Let's hit the Frankenstein once
and guarantee ourselves nine

1749
01:25:43,847 --> 01:25:46,683
by using the Grenade and the Dagger
on the Gargoyle.

1750
01:25:46,766 --> 01:25:50,019
Those in front wouldn't go for it,
so we'll definitely get the Gargoyle.

1751
01:25:50,103 --> 01:25:52,939
I will use my Dagger on Battlefield No. 1.

1752
01:25:53,022 --> 01:25:56,526
I will use the Grenade on No. 2.

1753
01:25:56,609 --> 01:25:58,903
-The Dagger on Battlefield No. 2.
-Yes.

1754
01:26:00,989 --> 01:26:02,407
The Zombie is important now.

1755
01:26:02,490 --> 01:26:04,534
The Zombie on Battlefield No. 3

1756
01:26:05,577 --> 01:26:07,453
was killed by Jeong Hyun-gyu.

1757
01:26:07,537 --> 01:26:08,371
Nice.

1758
01:26:08,454 --> 01:26:12,542
You are awarded 13 points,
the Ice and the Grenade.

1759
01:26:12,625 --> 01:26:14,752
I will use my Poison on Battlefield No. 3.

1760
01:26:14,836 --> 01:26:16,754
I will use my Grenade
on Battlefield No. 1.

1761
01:26:16,838 --> 01:26:18,381
Dagger on No. 2.

1762
01:26:18,464 --> 01:26:19,716
On Battlefield No. 1.

1763
01:26:19,799 --> 01:26:20,717
On No. 2…

1764
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:22,510
-No. 2.
-No. 2 for me.

1765
01:26:22,594 --> 01:26:24,721
I will use my Dagger on Battlefield No. 3.

1766
01:26:24,804 --> 01:26:26,806
Everything turned out
just like we expected.

1767
01:26:28,516 --> 01:26:31,019
We used our Grenade, the only item we had.

1768
01:26:31,102 --> 01:26:34,105
We should have turned things in our favor
on that last one.

1769
01:26:34,189 --> 01:26:35,523
But we failed.

1770
01:26:35,607 --> 01:26:37,859
Round 4 will now begin.

1771
01:26:37,942 --> 01:26:40,236
You have 20 minutes

1772
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:43,740
to go to the dealer room
to transfer any points.

1773
01:26:43,823 --> 01:26:47,744
If you take the Clown, you get ten points.

1774
01:26:47,827 --> 01:26:49,037
What's up?

1775
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:51,497
That's just a sop
while you get all the Pieces.

1776
01:26:51,581 --> 01:26:54,334
But we still don't know
what causes elimination.

1777
01:26:54,417 --> 01:26:56,002
The way things are, your team could…

1778
01:26:56,085 --> 01:26:56,920
Be in danger?

1779
01:26:57,003 --> 01:27:00,173
It might be dangerous
for those that haven't killed a monster,

1780
01:27:00,256 --> 01:27:03,843
so it might be safe to give the Clown
to a teammate who doesn't have a kill yet.

1781
01:27:03,927 --> 01:27:06,638
How's that for a deal?
And give us the Grenade?

1782
01:27:06,721 --> 01:27:08,640
-I'll talk to the others.
-Okay.

1783
01:27:08,723 --> 01:27:11,017
How will elimination be decided?

1784
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:12,602
Exactly. I have no idea.

1785
01:27:12,685 --> 01:27:16,272
The Grim Reaper has been revealed,
but it's nothing to do with elimination.

1786
01:27:16,356 --> 01:27:18,274
We're probably not completely in the dark.

1787
01:27:18,358 --> 01:27:20,902
They're bound to have
given us some clues already.

1788
01:27:21,861 --> 01:27:24,072
But what could they be?

1789
01:27:24,155 --> 01:27:26,074
-This is too weird.
-What?

1790
01:27:26,157 --> 01:27:29,535
We thought elimination would have
something to do with the Grim Reaper.

1791
01:27:29,619 --> 01:27:31,829
-But it's not.
-No, it isn't.

1792
01:27:31,913 --> 01:27:33,414
So how does one get eliminated?

1793
01:27:33,498 --> 01:27:36,000
Speaking of which,
what I've noticed that's strange

1794
01:27:36,084 --> 01:27:37,418
is that next to our points,

1795
01:27:37,502 --> 01:27:38,962
-we have hearts.
-Yes, hearts.

1796
01:27:39,045 --> 01:27:41,297
I think they're our own health points.

1797
01:27:41,381 --> 01:27:42,507
It's just so strange.

1798
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:45,093
For now,
let's make the best choice we can.

1799
01:27:45,176 --> 01:27:49,264
Their plan right now is
to give us the Clown.

1800
01:27:49,347 --> 01:27:52,100
So we now just need to think
about how to get the Grim Reaper.

1801
01:27:52,183 --> 01:27:54,227
But don't you think
we can actually get it?

1802
01:27:54,310 --> 01:27:55,979
If we use our Dynamite.

1803
01:27:56,062 --> 01:27:58,523
The Dokkaebi and the Medusa
are useless to us.

1804
01:27:58,606 --> 01:28:00,358
They'll use Ice on them this time.

1805
01:28:00,441 --> 01:28:03,194
-Because they have two Ices?
-Yes, they want both of those.

1806
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:04,570
I guess so.

1807
01:28:04,654 --> 01:28:07,240
They will use Ice on the Dokkaebi
and the Medusa. So we just…

1808
01:28:07,323 --> 01:28:10,076
Isn't it better just to claim them
straight away if they can?

1809
01:28:11,577 --> 01:28:13,121
-I've got it.
-What?

1810
01:28:13,204 --> 01:28:17,750
Can you make me go first in Round 5?
First turn.

1811
01:28:17,834 --> 01:28:19,002
-First?
-Yes.

1812
01:28:19,085 --> 01:28:20,503
We can. But why?

1813
01:28:20,586 --> 01:28:21,963
I'm not sure if I'm right,

1814
01:28:22,046 --> 01:28:24,507
but say they give us the Clown here.

1815
01:28:24,590 --> 01:28:27,468
If they freeze these,
what are they going to do next?

1816
01:28:27,552 --> 01:28:29,304
They'll all hit the Clown's position.

1817
01:28:29,387 --> 01:28:31,389
That means hitting the Grim Reaper
in advance.

1818
01:28:31,472 --> 01:28:33,683
Their next starters
will kill the Grim Reaper,

1819
01:28:33,766 --> 01:28:36,811
so that whatever we attack,
we don't get anything in Round 5.

1820
01:28:36,894 --> 01:28:40,356
Then we can't put you in first place.
They'll catch on.

1821
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:43,651
Then as soon as the door opens, we must
change the order and get No. 1.

1822
01:28:43,735 --> 01:28:45,028
So we should take the Clown?

1823
01:28:45,111 --> 01:28:46,112
Yes, we should.

1824
01:28:46,195 --> 01:28:48,531
Then we must give them all of the weapons,
as they asked.

1825
01:28:48,614 --> 01:28:50,533
Then we have to betray them on that.

1826
01:28:50,616 --> 01:28:52,368
Just lock our door and not give it up?

1827
01:28:52,452 --> 01:28:53,786
Why would we lock the door?

1828
01:28:53,870 --> 01:28:55,371
We can just not give it to them?

1829
01:28:55,455 --> 01:28:57,332
-Since they can't steal or use violence?
-Yes.

1830
01:28:57,415 --> 01:28:59,083
There's only one way
to turn things around.

1831
01:28:59,167 --> 01:29:01,627
Take the Clown
and not give them the Dynamite.

1832
01:29:01,711 --> 01:29:06,299
And tell them,
"Sorry, but it's our turn to betray you."

1833
01:29:06,382 --> 01:29:07,550
They betrayed us first.

1834
01:29:07,633 --> 01:29:08,718
If this strategy is right,

1835
01:29:08,801 --> 01:29:10,511
if we betray them after Round 4,

1836
01:29:10,595 --> 01:29:11,721
there's nothing they can do

1837
01:29:11,804 --> 01:29:13,723
since they've set up the Grim Reaper
for themselves.

1838
01:29:13,806 --> 01:29:15,016
Okay, let's sort it out.

1839
01:29:15,099 --> 01:29:16,225
We use the Dynamite

1840
01:29:16,309 --> 01:29:18,811
and then the Dual Swords
to get the Dokkaebi.

1841
01:29:18,895 --> 01:29:21,064
The Dokkaebi?
Isn't it better to use the Grenade?

1842
01:29:21,147 --> 01:29:23,566
-Let's use it on the Grim Reaper.
-On one target?

1843
01:29:24,150 --> 01:29:27,278
-Hang on a sec. I've got a funny feeling.
-Have you found something?

1844
01:29:27,362 --> 01:29:30,114
What if we're going to go up
where the monsters are?

1845
01:29:30,198 --> 01:29:31,657
Up there? In the reserve pool?

1846
01:29:31,741 --> 01:29:33,451
-It feels off.
-I think you're right.

1847
01:29:33,534 --> 01:29:35,745
-It's weird, with the hearts.
-I got chills.

1848
01:29:35,828 --> 01:29:38,373
They look the same.
Why would they design it like that?

1849
01:29:38,456 --> 01:29:40,666
Well, they do always exceed expectations.

1850
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:42,668
Anyhow, we still have to play hard

1851
01:29:42,752 --> 01:29:44,754
and get as many monsters as we can.

1852
01:29:44,837 --> 01:29:46,255
That hasn't changed.

1853
01:29:46,339 --> 01:29:47,757
I've sorted it all out.

1854
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:49,634
-Where are you going?
-Hang on.

1855
01:30:01,479 --> 01:30:02,980
Do we have to kill people later?

1856
01:30:03,481 --> 01:30:04,857
It is possible.

1857
01:31:41,287 --> 01:31:46,292
