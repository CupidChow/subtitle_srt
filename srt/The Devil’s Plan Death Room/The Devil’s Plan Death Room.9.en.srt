1
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:17,475
Kang Ji-yeong,
your prediction has succeeded.

2
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:18,476
I knew it.

3
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,652
It's luck. It was luck.

4
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:30,196
I wasn't feeling that great,

5
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,450
so I knew I would lose my concentration
as the game went on.

6
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:34,868
Looking at the rules,

7
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:37,203
I realized I could get the most points

8
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:38,955
by correctly predicting Zero.

9
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,665
When I looked at the dice,

10
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:43,918
the others had dice
that were mostly high numbers.

11
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:48,214
I thought, "If I get this early on,
I'll feel a lot more comfortable,"

12
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:50,341
so I went for it.

13
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:51,259
Bravo!

14
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:53,595
Son Eun-yu, your prediction has succeeded.

15
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:54,721
That's amazing.

16
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,099
Tinno, your prediction has failed.

17
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:02,854
Hang on, did Eun-yu get it right?

18
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:04,397
Yes, she did.

19
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,191
Let me return your prediction cards.

20
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:07,400
Okay.

21
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,319
Round 2 will now begin.

22
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:11,780
You can do it, Tinno.

23
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:13,782
Please roll your nine open dice.

24
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:31,841
-That is unbelievable.
-I can't believe it myself.

25
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,970
That's amazing. Eun-yu's dice.

26
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,972
That's crazy. She has five 6s.

27
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:41,559
Please place your hidden dice
in their respective towers and roll them.

28
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:47,857
With another 6,
she'd have two sets of all 6s.

29
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,736
Please submit your prediction cards.

30
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,490
7high, the first player,
please submit your prediction card.

31
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:57,826
This is going to take me ages. Sorry.

32
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:00,787
The prediction is going to
take a long time to choose.

33
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:03,623
God, this is so difficult.

34
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,587
7high's dice do seem pretty hard.

35
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,173
To be honest, things were looking bad.

36
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:15,510
Eun-yu had rolled really good dice,

37
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:17,470
and so were Tinno's.

38
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,848
And I believe Ji-yeong's were good too.

39
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:24,102
I thought there was almost no chance
to win a lot of points.

40
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:25,603
Good luck.

41
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:27,689
Bad luck.

42
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:29,649
Bad luck? That's a bit harsh.

43
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:31,484
Kang Ji-yeong, please submit your card.

44
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,361
Surely Ji-yeong won't go for Zero again.

45
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:42,287
Darn it, it's really difficult to tell
what everyone will choose this round.

46
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:46,958
Son Eun-yu,
please submit your prediction card.

47
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:48,793
Eun-yu will go for Max.

48
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:49,711
Yes, she has to.

49
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:51,379
She even has a Straight.

50
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:56,426
The dice came out really well again
for Round 2.

51
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:59,345
So, I thought, "That's a relief,"

52
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:00,805
and went for Max again.

53
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,640
Tinno, please submit your card.

54
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:04,517
Okay, here I go.

55
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:07,854
What do you think Tinno will play?

56
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:09,606
If I were him…

57
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,734
Minimum or the next one up.

58
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:15,195
Please submit
your first combination of dice.

59
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,655
7high will go first.

60
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:20,116
One, one, one.

61
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,910
These are the only good dice I have.

62
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:24,287
Just let me win one round.
Please. I beg you!

63
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,039
7high, you're being really sus.

64
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:27,874
-Am I?
-Yes, really sus.

65
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,252
Kang Ji-yeong, please submit your dice.

66
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,546
Now that Ji-yeong's
been in prison for two days,

67
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,548
she somehow seems different.

68
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:38,593
We said they looked scary.
On the second day, was it?

69
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:39,886
Now, she looks scary too.

70
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:41,095
I'm scared of her.

71
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,640
I guess you become scary in prison.

72
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:44,557
Yeah.

73
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,523
She has a Straight.

74
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,320
Son Eun-yu, please submit your dice.

75
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,740
Are you going for it?

76
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:01,658
I just have so many.

77
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,993
Jeez, you have so many.

78
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,286
Must be nice to be rich.

79
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,871
Tinno, please submit your dice.

80
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,461
-He probably went for the middle one.
-I can't even guess.

81
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:15,213
He could just play his Triple 1s.

82
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,426
-Triple 5s.
-Must be Triple 5s.

83
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,054
All players have now submitted their dice.

84
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:25,390
Tinno, please reveal your hidden dice.

85
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:26,557
Okay.

86
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:33,940
Here are current points.

87
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:35,483
Son Eun-yu scores six points,

88
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:36,776
Tinno three points,

89
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:38,653
7high one point,

90
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:40,321
and Kang Ji-yeong zero points.

91
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,240
Surely Ji-yeong isn't doing it again.

92
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:43,449
I know, right?

93
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:45,910
That's what it smells like.

94
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,496
-Next, Son Eun-yu will go first.
-You're both suspicious.

95
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:50,915
Please submit
your second combination of dice.

96
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,834
Tinno can see what Eun-yu plays
and go with Triple 6s.

97
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:55,378
But we don't know what Tinno bet on.

98
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,095
That is definitely Max.

99
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:05,847
Tinno.

100
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:09,892
Hang on, what do I do about Ji-yeong?

101
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:15,648
No idea, I'll leave it up to 7high.

102
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:21,529
-Has he gone for Min? I don't think so.
-I think so.

103
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,990
7high, please submit your dice.

104
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,828
-Don't do it.
-Surely not. Hey.

105
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:30,872
7high.

106
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:34,125
How long did you think
I would stand idly by?

107
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,712
There's no need for bluffing.
I think they both got Triple 6s.

108
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:40,423
Kang Ji-yeong, please submit your dice.

109
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:54,228
I'm going to do that
if I end up in prison block.

110
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,189
Don't. You'll embarrass yourself.

111
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,196
What the heck is that?

112
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,493
Jeez, she's confusing everyone.

113
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:11,162
All players have now submitted their dice.

114
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:12,497
Son Eun-yu,

115
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,707
7high, Kang Ji-yeong,

116
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,376
please reveal your hidden dice.

117
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,835
Let's see what you've got.

118
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:19,629
Dear me.

119
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,135
Good job.

120
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,763
Kang Ji-yeong,
please reveal your hidden dice.

121
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:30,598
Ji-yeong is playing well.

122
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:34,477
Oh, my God.

123
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,899
Oh, my God.

124
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:42,235
Smells fishy.

125
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:43,653
Here are current points.

126
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:46,572
Son Eun-yu and 7high get 4.5 points each.

127
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,241
Tinno gets one point,

128
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:50,201
and Kang Ji-yeong gets zero points.

129
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:51,702
-I guess she's gone for Zero.
-Exactly.

130
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,246
Won't somebody stop her?

131
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:55,164
But they also
have to get their own points.

132
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:58,251
It's not easy to stop her since
they have their own predictions to make.

133
00:06:58,334 --> 00:06:59,836
Still, they can't just let her be.

134
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,256
-No, not again…
-Ji-yeong really has nerves of steel.

135
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,591
-Don't get it twice in a row.
-What are you talking about?

136
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:08,136
The only thing she can get now
is Triple 5s.

137
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:10,721
Hey… what about that?

138
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,350
If she goes with that…

139
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,686
It's Zero. I can feel it.

140
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,521
It's Zero.

141
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:23,443
As the player with the most points,
Son Eun-yu will go first.

142
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,153
The order is driving me nuts.

143
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,155
How do I block it?

144
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:29,657
Gosh.

145
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,211
It's all you.

146
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:48,217
I don't know. Well, it's your choice.

147
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,851
A 5 and 4?
But there's nothing smaller than a 1.

148
00:07:58,769 --> 00:07:59,604
Why did she do that?

149
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:01,272
If that's a 1, what a legend.

150
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:03,816
If she has a 1
but played it like that to hide it?

151
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,152
If it's 5, 4, 1,
then Ji-yeong can't score.

152
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,321
Tinno, please submit your dice.

153
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:19,248
7high, please submit your dice.

154
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:23,169
He has to block her
because Ji-yeong definitely went for Zero.

155
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,464
Let's try to read what Ji-yeong did.

156
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,549
Look into my eyes.

157
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,349
Really?

158
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,019
She's done it again?

159
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:42,188
You're truly amazing.

160
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:44,273
-She's gone for Zero again?
-She has.

161
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,151
Her expression just now. It's a Zero.

162
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,570
I can't block her.

163
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:57,119
There's no turning back.

164
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,246
There's nothing I can do.

165
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,122
Kang Ji-yeong, please submit your dice.

166
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,667
Is it going to be 1, 4, 5?
Ji-yeong's hands just "rat-a-tat."

167
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,630
What is there to think about?
That's even scarier.

168
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:14,720
-See? It couldn't be Zero, dummy.
-You're right.

169
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,139
It didn't make any sense
for it to be Zero.

170
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,601
She's not stupid. She already got 40
points, why would she go for Zero again?

171
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,436
Please reveal your hidden dice.

172
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,401
Here are current points.

173
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:29,902
Tinno gets six points,

174
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,446
Ji-yeong three points,

175
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,491
7high and Son Eun-yu
get half a point each.

176
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,994
Here are the player's predictions.

177
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:40,955
7high, your prediction has succeeded.

178
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:45,001
Kang Ji-yeong,
your prediction has succeeded.

179
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:45,918
Son Eun-yu,

180
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:48,421
your prediction has succeeded.

181
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,090
-What about Tinno?
-Tinno…

182
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,509
Tinno,

183
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:55,511
your prediction has succeeded.

184
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:57,847
That's a relief.

185
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,891
What the heck? When did she get 46 points?

186
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:02,560
Ji-yeong must be petrified.

187
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:03,728
She's coming for her.

188
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,396
She can't afford to score just a few.

189
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,482
Round 3 will now begin.

190
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,484
I hate going first.

191
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,278
Please roll your open dice.

192
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:15,573
Well, Eun-yu got a successful Max,

193
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:17,116
and Ji-young got a Zero,

194
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:20,494
so the two of them were
quite safe with a high score.

195
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,747
7high and I were just four points apart,

196
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,374
so I went into Round 3 thinking,

197
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,919
"It's going to be a fight
to the death with this guy."

198
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:31,589
This is the first time I've had
sweaty hands at a prison match.

199
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,758
Really? Fingers crossed.

200
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,683
From one extreme to the other.

201
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,018
That's no good.

202
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:49,398
Ji-yeong looks good for Zero.

203
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:50,941
-Goodness me.
-Seriously?

204
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:51,901
Darn.

205
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,235
Gosh.

206
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,195
What's this?

207
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:56,155
Eun-yu and Ji-yeong both can try for Zero.

208
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:58,824
7high definitely has to go for Max.

209
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,412
Please submit your prediction cards.

210
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,831
Tinno will go first.

211
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,875
-Seriously…
-Please submit your prediction card.

212
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,252
If Ji-yeong and Eun-yu
both have their eyes on Zero…

213
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,089
-Right?
-…that would be super fun to watch.

214
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,216
I have no idea what Ji-yeong will go for.

215
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:18,302
-Seriously. This is driving me crazy.
-I can't tell what she's doing.

216
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,221
I can't predict it.

217
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:22,264
It's not the combination you can read.

218
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:29,814
Please submit
your first combination of dice.

219
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,607
Tinno will go first.

220
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:35,611
Hang on, what should I play?

221
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,535
No. Better to not go first next time.

222
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:43,911
That'll be reassuring.

223
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:48,916
The order of play is
very important in Triple Dice

224
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:51,043
because ultimately,

225
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:55,631
the person who goes last
slightly influences the ranking.

226
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:59,552
Kang Ji-yeong succeeded
in getting Zero in the first round

227
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:04,098
partly due to the benefit of going last

228
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:06,684
in two of the three turns.

229
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:11,856
On the other hand, Tinno, who went
first or second in all three turns,

230
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:14,942
must have felt very frustrated.

231
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:20,865
What's this?

232
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:26,871
-If that's a 3, it's a Straight.
-Right.

233
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:29,665
7high, please block it for me.

234
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:30,750
Please.

235
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,461
7high, please submit your dice.

236
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,968
Kang Ji-yeong, please submit your dice.

237
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,688
-She's not going for Zero. It's Min.
-Yeah, must be Minimum.

238
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,232
Son Eun-yu, please submit your dice.

239
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,784
Oh, come on! Please!

240
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,328
I hate it too.
Why are you playing your dice like this?

241
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:08,746
What do you hate?

242
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:11,957
Going first. I don't want to
go first or second. I hate being first.

243
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,334
She wants to go this way.

244
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:16,504
I don't really want to play this.

245
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,380
-You have to.
-Jeez.

246
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:22,259
I have no choice.

247
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,470
All players have now submitted their dice.

248
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:26,597
What is it? Oh, she's gone with a Triple.

249
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,432
Please reveal your hidden dice.

250
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,351
I did whatever I could to not go first.

251
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:31,769
But now, she's going first.

252
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,187
And I still go second.

253
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,980
It was only one turn ahead.

254
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,233
7high, please reveal your hidden dice.

255
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,109
Seriously…

256
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,153
-Straight!
-So the points are…

257
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,655
Son Eun-yu six points,

258
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:45,366
7high, Kang Ji-yeong two points each.

259
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:47,159
Tinno, zero points.

260
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:50,079
-Those two split. Tinno gets nothing.
-No points.

261
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,206
This time, Son Eun-yu will go first.

262
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:54,333
I really didn't want to go first.

263
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:59,630
I was trying to lose,
and I still ended up going second. Damn.

264
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,382
What did you predict, Tinno?

265
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:03,300
Was it Zero?

266
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:04,385
What the heck?

267
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:07,429
I didn't have the nerve to do that…

268
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:11,308
-Was it Zero?
-…in my situation since I'm in last place.

269
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:14,061
-You have to act bold.
-Let me just get one.

270
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:16,355
My dice are terrible this round.

271
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:18,023
You just want to get one round?

272
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,693
If you let me, I'd be grateful. Just one.

273
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:21,735
Just one.

274
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:27,950
Is that right?

275
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,959
Tinno, please submit your dice.

276
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,336
Now we'll find out what Tinno has.

277
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,922
Please just one opportunity.

278
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,758
-Just one opportunity.
-I had no idea you'd play that.

279
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:46,468
Just once.

280
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:52,725
-7high, please submit your dice.
-See? Darn it.

281
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:54,059
He must've chosen Zero.

282
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,645
-But the bad thing is that…
-Yes?

283
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,814
7high will block it for sure.

284
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,399
Ji-yeong can, too.

285
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:01,317
You're right.

286
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,444
There's no way it'll work. What can he do?

287
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,574
Tinno went for Zero.

288
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:12,786
Do you think Tinno's bluffing
or went for Minimum?

289
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,539
-It could be Minimum.
-Yeah?

290
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,833
Because he has Triple 4s.

291
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,836
Hang on. There's a lot riding on this,
so I'll take my time.

292
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,636
So the point gap is very small.

293
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,056
I think that's it.

294
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,475
So I'll just…

295
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:44,318
Do you think 7high is agonizing
over whether or not to block it?

296
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:48,322
He might have chosen More.
His dice are pretty good.

297
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,158
Okay.

298
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,242
I'll do it.

299
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:06,423
Nice.

300
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,843
Okay. I'm done. I think I got it.

301
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:10,970
Okay.

302
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,431
Kang Ji-yeong, please submit your dice.

303
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:16,976
Okay.

304
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,477
Two hidden dice?

305
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,521
All players have now submitted their dice.

306
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:22,856
Please reveal your hidden dice.

307
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:34,410
Son Eun-yu,
please reveal your hidden dice.

308
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:36,704
It's a 5.

309
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,080
Did they just tie?

310
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,457
Kang Ji-yeong and Son Eun-yu
get 4.5 points,

311
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,750
Tinno gets one point,

312
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,419
and 7high gets zero points.

313
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:47,089
If Eun-yu had gone for Max,
that would've been amazing.

314
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,049
Why doesn't the lead-off change?

315
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:51,677
I played that thinking
I would hand it over. Seriously.

316
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,595
Just stop winning.

317
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,223
Why does no one else get to go first?

318
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:58,434
This time, Son Eun-yu will go first.

319
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,185
Please submit your dice.

320
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,066
Tinno, please submit your dice.

321
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:11,905
7high.

322
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:19,413
Kang Ji-yeong, please submit your dice.

323
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:27,421
7high, please reveal your hidden dice.

324
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,506
Six.

325
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:31,508
Nice 6.

326
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,052
Good!

327
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:34,845
Good, good.

328
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:36,889
7high gets six points.

329
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:38,182
Tinno gets three,

330
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:41,143
Son Eun-yu gets one point,

331
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,187
and Kang Ji-yeong gets zero.

332
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,148
Here are the player's predictions.

333
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,691
7high,

334
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,193
your prediction has succeeded.

335
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:51,487
Did 7high predict correctly?

336
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,363
Kang Ji-yeong,
your prediction has succeeded.

337
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,407
-What the heck? Everyone's correct.
-And Eun-yu?

338
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:56,575
Son Eun-yu,

339
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:58,911
your prediction has failed.

340
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,371
Tinno…

341
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,958
Tinno, please be Min.

342
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,003
Tinno, your prediction has failed.

343
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,214
Come on! Seriously.

344
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:14,718
He predicted Zero?

345
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:20,099
I consider Tinno to be the de facto leader
of the living area's team.

346
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:24,603
Despite that,
I couldn't afford to lose that round,

347
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:26,980
so I had to ding him a bit.

348
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,690
At the start of the round,

349
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:34,613
I thought this might be the round
where Tinno went all out for victory.

350
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:38,075
So I thought I had to counter
every move he made during Round 3

351
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:40,661
in order to widen the point gap
between us.

352
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:43,705
And when he played
the 2, 4, and a hidden number,

353
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,083
I was certain that he was going for Zero.

354
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,418
I really hoped
your hand wasn't going for that 2.

355
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:50,337
-That's why I agonized over it.
-You did great.

356
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,714
Oh, Tinno.

357
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,468
If you think about it,
7high blocked everything Tinno did.

358
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:57,386
Good!

359
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,555
-The game's not over yet.
-Exactly.

360
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:02,224
Round 4 will now begin.

361
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,810
-All Tinno can do is go for Zero, right?
-Right.

362
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:06,854
And they just have to
stop him once from getting it.

363
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:08,564
-They'll gang up on him.
-I know.

364
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,775
Please roll your nine open dice.

365
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,944
Will the heavens forsake me?

366
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,030
Good luck takes skill too!

367
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:31,295
Okay.

368
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:33,380
What an iffy set.

369
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:35,799
-He has two 4s.
-1, 3 and 4…

370
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,927
Well, it's not impossible.
But the others won't just stand idly by.

371
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,262
Of course they wouldn't.

372
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,764
There's a 1, 2, and 4 on that side too.

373
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,433
All three have something to block with.

374
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:47,728
Please roll your hidden dice
inside the towers.

375
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:53,025
I think it's worth going for Max.
If he has a hidden 4 and 5.

376
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:55,402
So if he goes for Max with 4 and 5,

377
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:57,821
then 12 points, which makes 24…

378
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:01,825
If he can overtake 7high,
can't he make it?

379
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,244
Please submit your prediction cards.

380
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:06,914
7high, the first player,
please submit your card.

381
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:14,546
An 8-point difference…

382
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,882
If I want to prevent that gap…

383
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,091
Gotta pray.

384
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,052
When calculated, it was an 8-point gap.

385
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:22,471
In the case he succeeded
in doubling his points,

386
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,473
I had to consider a strategy

387
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:28,018
where Tinno could accumulate
as many points as possible,

388
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:31,521
while I still had the dice
to keep him from getting Zero.

389
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:34,775
What can I do? He's got the point.

390
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,493
Kang Ji-yeong,
please submit your prediction card.

391
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,996
Don't you think Ji-yeong could go for Max?

392
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,836
Hey, there's a fight for first.

393
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,421
Jeez.

394
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:59,925
There are two matches going on,
one for first and one for last.

395
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,927
Ji-yeong's dice were so strong.

396
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,763
When we threw the dice for Round 4,
all I saw was Ji-yeong's.

397
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:12,521
Son Eun-yu,
please submit your prediction card.

398
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,565
The air of the match is different.

399
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:24,992
Tinno, please submit your card.

400
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,209
Tinno must be agonizing over this
since it's the last round.

401
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,420
Why did his dice have to be so bad?

402
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:37,587
Three Doubles.

403
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:50,017
Please submit
your first combination of dice.

404
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,770
7high, the first player,
please submit your dice.

405
00:21:58,734 --> 00:21:59,568
Triple 4s?

406
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:02,070
Maybe he just played Double 4s

407
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,780
but is luring them to play Triple 5s.

408
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:06,074
Could be.

409
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,827
Kang Ji-yeong, please submit your dice.

410
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:20,505
Everyone's playing hidden dice
from the get-go.

411
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,883
Son Eun-yu, please submit your dice.

412
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,179
It's driving me nuts.

413
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:28,764
It sure does.

414
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,854
Okay.

415
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,407
Next, Tinno. Please submit your dice.

416
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,537
Whichever way I did the math,

417
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:55,415
even with Max and six points
on all three turns, I'd have 18 in total.

418
00:22:55,499 --> 00:23:00,629
As long as 7high got six points,
he would have beaten me.

419
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,714
Tinno, please submit your card.

420
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,515
I had no choice but to go for Zero,

421
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:13,892
and I'm sure everyone else knew that.

422
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:15,227
But luckily for me,

423
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,520
I was going last.

424
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:21,149
Going last, I had to make it look like
I was playing a strong combination.

425
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,318
Eun-yu played 3, 5, and a hidden die.

426
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:27,614
The highest dice combo
I could play was 3, 5, and 6.

427
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:29,157
I had to play that

428
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:32,411
or get rid of 1 or 2, which was a part
of the best combination that I had.

429
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:35,664
But if I did that,
I would be screwed on the next turn.

430
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,502
You're doing well.

431
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:42,421
Okay, then…

432
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:47,467
All players have now submitted their dice.

433
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:49,261
Please reveal your hidden dice.

434
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,012
Let's see.

435
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:55,851
What do we have?

436
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:58,061
I could not predict that.

437
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,273
That was unexpected. Look at that.

438
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:03,275
That's what I'm talking about!

439
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:04,568
Let's go.

440
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:06,987
Son Eun-yu,
please reveal your hidden dice.

441
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:10,991
Here are the current points.

442
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:12,617
Kang Ji-yeong gets six points,

443
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,035
7high gets three points.

444
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:16,329
Son Eun-yu gets one point,

445
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,582
and Tinno gets zero points.

446
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,918
Please submit
your second combination of dice.

447
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,753
Kang Ji-yeong will go first.

448
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:31,178
Is she trying to block?

449
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,471
No, she isn't.

450
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:35,265
She must want to use those 4s
to get six points.

451
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:36,308
Then is that a 4?

452
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:38,143
-No, she has a 5.
-It must be a 5.

453
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:44,524
Son Eun-yu, please submit your dice.

454
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:49,112
Why are you looking at me like that?

455
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,872
If I played 1, 2, and 4,

456
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:02,167
that would confirm Tinno's departure.

457
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,252
Though I thought
it was right to get rid of him,

458
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:07,756
it was really tough
when I realized he'd get eliminated by me.

459
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,845
Block it or not?

460
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:17,933
Let's play just one more turn.

461
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:26,691
Tinno, please submit your dice.

462
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:36,284
Can I change my dice?

463
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:39,246
You can't change.

464
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:40,747
Your turn is over already.

465
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:44,000
I really made a mistake at that point.

466
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,961
I should have just played a Double,

467
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:49,506
but my dice were so bad
that I thought I'd get second place.

468
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:54,636
So I thought, "Oh, if I'm going to
get second place, I'll just bet Zero."

469
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:57,389
But in the first round, I got one point,

470
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:59,391
and my Zero was gone.

471
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:00,600
So my new strategy was…

472
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:04,354
The number of turns was fixed,
so I'll prevent his Zero in the next turn.

473
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:08,692
On this turn, I wanted points
so that I could go first on the next turn.

474
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:13,405
So I used my 4 in a Straight
to get as many points as possible.

475
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:17,450
I was contemplating
how to play my 4 in the next turn,

476
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:18,827
but it was gone.

477
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,581
This is driving me mad.

478
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:27,544
Wow, I can't believe
it's come down to the two of them.

479
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,591
I checked the other players' dice first

480
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:35,302
because I didn't have
the dice to block him on my own.

481
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:38,471
I checked Ji-yeong and Eun-yu's dice,
and they both had 1, 2, and 4.

482
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:42,601
So I thought, "Oh, they're bound
to realize and block him,"

483
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:47,022
but they didn't keep him in check,
so I was actually quite flabbergasted.

484
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:06,583
7high, please submit your dice.

485
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:22,599
GG.

486
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:28,355
All players have now submitted their dice.

487
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:29,606
He wins if it's a 1.

488
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:31,232
Please reveal your hidden dice.

489
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:49,334
Good.

490
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,131
Very good.

491
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:56,841
Here are the current points.

492
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,301
Son Eun-yu scores six points,

493
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,553
Kang Ji-yeong three points,

494
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:01,846
Tinno one point,

495
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:04,015
and 7high zero points.

496
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:09,187
My dice were all so high.
There was nothing I could do.

497
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:13,149
If only there was a one in that cup,
then Tinno would be back here.

498
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,485
Still, I'm glad it was you
that dealt the coup de grâce.

499
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,321
I liked him the most here.

500
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:21,282
My match with him was very meaningful

501
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:24,911
because I considered him
to be the best at these games.

502
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:28,373
And I was able to
win the match against him,

503
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:31,126
so that's why
it was pretty meaningful to me.

504
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,920
Son Eun-yu, please submit your dice.

505
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:36,172
Tinno.

506
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:39,217
7high.

507
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:43,471
Kang Ji-yeong.

508
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,268
All players have now submitted their dice.

509
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:49,853
Please reveal your hidden dice.

510
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:53,982
Kang Ji-yeong gets six points,

511
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,025
7high gets three points.

512
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:56,985
Good job.

513
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,319
Son Eun-yu gets one point,

514
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,904
and Tinno gets zero points.

515
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:02,907
Good job, 7high.

516
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:05,785
Here are the player's predictions.

517
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:07,328
7high, your prediction has succeeded.

518
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,288
Nice.

519
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:10,248
Kang Ji-yeong, your prediction has failed.

520
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:12,625
Son Eun-yu, your prediction has failed.

521
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:15,128
Tinno, your prediction has failed.

522
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,799
That concludes the game.

523
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:22,677
Here are the results of the game.

524
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:25,054
Really well played.

525
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:27,098
The player with the highest points,

526
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:30,852
Kang Ji-yeong will be awarded one Piece.

527
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:31,770
Nice.

528
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:33,563
Ms. Kang Ji-yeong, here is your Piece.

529
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:36,441
The player with the lowest points,

530
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:39,819
Tinno becomes the seventh player
eliminated from The Devil's Plan.

531
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:40,820
Well played.

532
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:44,699
Tinno, please
leave this place immediately.

533
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:45,992
Thank you.

534
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:47,076
Can I get a hug?

535
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,496
Eun-yu, it was nice
to get to play with you like this.

536
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:50,914
-Ji-yeong.
-Thank you.

537
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:52,791
-Get me a vitamin next time.
-Okay.

538
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,959
-As for us, you know. Next time.
-I know.

539
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:55,960
See you again.

540
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,588
God, I hate this.

541
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:01,049
We're losing people one by one.

542
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:04,552
I feel like it's my fault.

543
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,429
Why would you say that?

544
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,306
Because Hyun-joon asked me.

545
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,145
We're all in it together.

546
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:18,107
Oh! I should have given…

547
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:20,735
-No, no.
-I…

548
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:23,029
It's okay.

549
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:25,323
-Okay. I'm outta here!
-Rules are rules.

550
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:26,741
-Thank you.
-See you soon!

551
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,535
-Well done.
-Get home safely.

552
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:32,455
My time at The Devil's Plan
was truly a blessed time for me.

553
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,874
Because for a board gamer,

554
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:40,004
it's such a joy to be
forced to play games like this.

555
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,549
It was like a dream.

556
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:45,218
I wanted to go all the way
and play more games,

557
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:49,556
so I regret not being able to
play with some of the other guys.

558
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:54,018
I really hope that either
Kyuhyun, 7high, or So-hui

559
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:58,356
will make it to the final
and emerge as the winner.

560
00:30:58,439 --> 00:30:59,607
Take care.

561
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:25,508
THE DEVIL'S PLAN
DEATH ROOM

562
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:28,219
That concludes the prison match.

563
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:31,681
All players,
please return to the living space.

564
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:32,682
Thank you.

565
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:34,142
-Bye.
-Thank you.

566
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:36,311
I'm so sorry, 7high.

567
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:39,188
Why are you apologizing?

568
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,816
Anyone could make a mistake
while focusing on their own game.

569
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:46,362
I just felt a little stressed
because of the situation I was in.

570
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:47,363
I am so sorry.

571
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:49,115
Don't be. Why do you keep apologizing?

572
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:51,826
I set the game up,
and I could have ended it myself.

573
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,536
No. It's okay.

574
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,372
Anyone can make a mistake.

575
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:57,498
Still, I'm really…

576
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,751
-The results weren't bad. We're alive.
-You were so reliable. Thank you.

577
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,210
-Thank you.
-I'm so sorry.

578
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:04,172
Why apologize to me?
You were playing your own game.

579
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,758
It's not that.
At the end, I made that mistake--

580
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:09,135
Not at all. Don't worry about it.

581
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:13,389
Now those guys in the living area
will definitely be on edge.

582
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:16,976
They've now seen two of their guys
come here and get eliminated.

583
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:20,939
I think this is the time
we have to show our strength.

584
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:24,567
You think you can send Tinno here
like he's on a prison jaunt?

585
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:25,735
Fine, come bring it.

586
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:41,334
Well, to be honest, if it was anyone else,
I wouldn't be feeling like this.

587
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,802
Kyuhyun, what are you up to?

588
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:52,553
Just thinking.

589
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,014
Do you want to be alone?

590
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,641
No, just taking a moment.

591
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:03,231
You know, So-hui can sleep standing up?
So-hui's sleep method.

592
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:08,486
Everyone, please leave my room.

593
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:11,280
He's being cute right now. Our cat.

594
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:14,325
As long as you maintain your balance,
this is quite comfortable.

595
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:15,326
Yes, it is.

596
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:19,914
We don't have much time.
We might all be in prison tomorrow.

597
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:22,041
Right.

598
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:24,127
That's right.

599
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,795
-Are you leaving because of us?
-Let's go, Kyuhyun.

600
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:28,214
It feels quite lonely
because there's no one talking.

601
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:30,091
-We need to start talking loudly.
-Right.

602
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:33,136
It has to be somewhat rowdy in here.

603
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:35,638
Normally when you're home alone,
you don't feel lonely, right?

604
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:39,142
But being in here,
when someone like that leaves,

605
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:42,145
you really feel lonely all of a sudden.

606
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,773
I normally don't feel like that,
but now I'm all, "What is this?"

607
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,073
Why are you following me?

608
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:56,784
-Shall we do ten laps around here?
-Shall we?

609
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,494
Why are you following me around?

610
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:02,498
Gosh, honestly…

611
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:04,834
How fun.

612
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:09,630
I should go wash up.

613
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:11,299
He's running away.

614
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:15,511
My goodness.

615
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,388
-Oh, the lights.
-You get surprised every time.

616
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,475
Yes, every time. I'm always like this.

617
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:23,644
On the one hand,

618
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:28,274
since I know what kind of message
we've sent to the guys in the living area…

619
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:31,861
Honestly, we got rid of their leader.

620
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:33,571
We've deposed their leader

621
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:37,241
who was in the middle
controlling everything.

622
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:38,868
When you lose your leader,

623
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:43,915
your teamwork can break
causing you to get anxious,

624
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:46,542
and there is a higher chance
to make mistakes.

625
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,711
So we need to take advantage of that.

626
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:51,464
We finally have an opportunity,
for the first time.

627
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:54,133
We'd better get
a good night's rest tonight.

628
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:55,968
Let's sleep early today.

629
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:58,221
We didn't get much sleep last night.

630
00:34:58,304 --> 00:34:59,472
Sounds good.

631
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,225
Well played today. Good job, everyone.

632
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:08,439
Today's game was the kind of game
that I really suck at,

633
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:12,360
so I think whatever we play tomorrow,
it's bound to be better than today.

634
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:20,034
I feel a bit upset, for some reason.

635
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:23,162
Like I betrayed him in some way.

636
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:24,956
Betrayed how? You didn't betray him.

637
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:29,335
I know we were just playing the game,
but given the way things turned out,

638
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:30,795
I think we were a bit crappy.

639
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,965
We found a way to survive
that maybe wasn't the most honorable.

640
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:35,383
A way with a higher chance.

641
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,009
To be honest, So-hui,

642
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:39,512
you just did what
Tinno and I told you to do.

643
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:40,763
That was my choice.

644
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:43,474
It's just that the timing was right,
so I agreed.

645
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:46,686
In any case,
even if it wasn't the four of us,

646
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:48,521
anyone would've ended up like this.

647
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:49,564
That's the way I see it.

648
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,567
We need to break the curse of the prison.

649
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:56,320
Yeah.

650
00:35:57,196 --> 00:36:00,658
We've been drinking for a while,
but it's only past 1 a.m.

651
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:02,535
Sleep well.

652
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:04,203
-Okay, sleep well.
-Okay.

653
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:13,754
Every morning I would go to the gym,

654
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,883
and he would greet me brightly by asking,
"Did you sleep well?"

655
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:19,594
And he was always
trying to keep our spirits up.

656
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:23,222
He always put others before himself.

657
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:27,685
Because I've seen all that,
it was quite hard for me to see him go.

658
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:07,975
Thank you.

659
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:51,811
Why are you sitting there like that?

660
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:52,937
I only just got up.

661
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:53,854
Did you?

662
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,365
I'm scared of today's game.

663
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:05,866
I wonder what it might be.

664
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:08,786
Don't you think Eun-yu would be

665
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:13,708
lacking vitamins, protein,
and essential nutrients?

666
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,627
Chicken rice porridge?

667
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:19,171
And peach slices.

668
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:26,846
-We have peaches today.
-What?

669
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:29,682
I'm looking forward to
having my peaches for dessert.

670
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:32,893
I dropped mine on the floor
as soon as it came, but I still ate it.

671
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:35,229
"This I can't afford to lose!"

672
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:47,825
Don't be like that.

673
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:50,161
What was I supposed to do?
They only gave us two slices.

674
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:54,665
I didn't know it was chicken porridge.
I only realized after I started eating it.

675
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:57,752
I got excited and then
found a big chunk of chicken.

676
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:59,128
I have a good feeling about today.

677
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:01,797
What are you talking about?

678
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,174
That's nonsense.

679
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:06,510
I found a huge chunk of chicken.

680
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:18,064
I have a good feeling about today.

681
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,816
So, do you want to play
four against three today?

682
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,860
Eun-yu, you do what you want.

683
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:24,153
Just let each other know.

684
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:27,323
I said this last time too,
but they didn't keep to it.

685
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:29,075
I don't mean to break our alliance.

686
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:31,494
-You want to bring someone over?
-Yes.

687
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:33,079
Who do you have in mind?

688
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:34,705
We need to see what the game is,

689
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:36,916
but rather than
who we want to have on our team,

690
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:39,460
if we consider
who we could realistically bring over…

691
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:41,128
Either Kyuhyun or So-hui.

692
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:46,217
What reason can we give to convince
Kyuhyun or So-hui to join us?

693
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:49,095
"What are you getting
by working with them?"

694
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:50,679
"Look what happened to Tinno."

695
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:53,391
Wait, do they have
different relations to Hyun-gyu?

696
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:55,226
How do they all fit together?

697
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:57,103
Tell me about the politics there.

698
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:58,938
Okay, let's go through the politics.

699
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:01,565
What happened was,
do you remember the second game?

700
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:02,775
During the second game,

701
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:04,944
Ji-yeong got three Pieces and I got one,

702
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:06,946
-so we were in the living area.
-Okay.

703
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:10,699
From the point of view
of those with four Pieces,

704
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:13,619
they were helping those with one Piece,

705
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:14,995
namely me and Ji-yeong.

706
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,623
But Hyun-gyu said he was opposed to that.

707
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:19,333
-Hyun-gyu didn't like that?
-Yeah.

708
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,251
Are you pushing her?

709
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:23,421
If you tell me to.
I was just talking with Kyuhyun.

710
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,256
Of course,
I don't want to get blood on my hands.

711
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:26,590
If you don't, she'll win.

712
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:28,300
Right, but we'll see.

713
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:32,054
Kyuhyun, from now on,
let's not make teams like this.

714
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:35,099
Even at the start,
I was never on the same side as Mr. Poker.

715
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:38,436
As we were playing, he realized
there was nothing in it for him.

716
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:42,064
So we talked on the second day.

717
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:43,482
DAY 2
AFTER THE UNKNOWN MATCH

718
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:45,568
We're talking and sharing things,

719
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:51,115
but in fact, Hyun-gyu doesn't feel like
he's in a proper alliance with you.

720
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:53,242
He's not certain about it.

721
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:57,663
Anyhow, we just formed a team like this
while living here together,

722
00:40:57,746 --> 00:40:59,832
but I'm not sure how tightknit it is.

723
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:01,333
Plus you two didn't talk much.

724
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:03,794
It doesn't matter to me.
And I already knew.

725
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:08,757
So, we wanted to make
a new alliance from the third day.

726
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:12,428
Tomorrow, I think it would be better
for us to not be divided like this.

727
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:14,889
It's getting too polar.
The prison versus the living area.

728
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:17,766
I just hope we can avoid
this sort of vibe.

729
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,560
So, okay, fine.

730
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:21,479
That's what was agreed,

731
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,314
but as soon as the game started…

732
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:24,815
Hyun-joon's ten Pieces.

733
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,025
He came with ten Pieces.

734
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:27,860
And suddenly the two were together.

735
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:30,196
But in truth, a lot of things
had changed overnight

736
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:32,281
because the two are potential winners.

737
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:35,659
They both have a real advantage
when it comes to victory.

738
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:39,371
And in any case, from our perspective,

739
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:41,832
he was one of the prison gang,
but suddenly,

740
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,751
he made an alliance with our main guys.

741
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,085
So that's why I was like…

742
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,462
So, you… right. Oh.

743
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:48,547
So that's when I started thinking,

744
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:52,801
"Oh, even Tinno and So-hui
are on that side."

745
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:55,179
The way I saw it,
they were just using them.

746
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:57,806
So we have the choice.
Six with you, or six with them.

747
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:00,309
But I think we have no choice
but to go with them.

748
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:01,685
One of them will come out on top.

749
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:05,105
I realized that they were
trying to maintain the winner's privilege

750
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:07,149
with the number of Pieces they had.

751
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:09,318
And that's how things have been so far.

752
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,445
What about after that?

753
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:12,780
After what?

754
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:15,199
After that, I ended up here.

755
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:16,283
Oh, right. I see.

756
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:20,746
By the way, we should sort things out.

757
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:22,790
We always make the same mistakes.

758
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,875
No one was really keeping order.

759
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:26,877
-Tinno did a lot to keep order.
-Yes.

760
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:29,922
But we all just say what we want,
and I don't listen--

761
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:31,173
You!

762
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:32,800
-Darn it.
-He does it his way.

763
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:33,926
From now on…

764
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:35,886
Watch it for yourself later.

765
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,721
Just how much you ignored me.

766
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:42,226
Hyun-gyu, did you use that shape just now?
The arrow that I lent you.

767
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:43,894
This one with the basic arrow like this?

768
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:45,062
See? He doesn't listen.

769
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:46,564
Did you use that arrow earlier?

770
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:48,357
-What about this?
-Hey, damn it.

771
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,316
Jerk.

772
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,151
Me? What is it? I'm sorry.

773
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:52,820
I'm sorry.

774
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,990
You know how some people
can't listen when they're studying.

775
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:57,575
-I know.
-I'm that type of person.

776
00:42:57,658 --> 00:43:00,327
I don't hear even if
someone is speaking directly to me.

777
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:01,412
You have to tap me.

778
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:04,373
I'm scared of Ji-yeong's glare.

779
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,333
How about Kyuhyun?

780
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:08,961
He told me he wasn't sure if it was right.

781
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:12,673
He's been saying that since day one,
and he'll be unsure to the end.

782
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:14,842
-So he isn't trustworthy?
-He has no idea.

783
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:18,721
Not now. Not ever. He'll have
no idea until the moment he's gone.

784
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:21,599
-Why would he?
-What do you think about So-hui?

785
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:24,935
To be honest, I don't know
what So-hui's really thinking.

786
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:27,563
So-hui is very passively
on the aggressive.

787
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:30,399
She clearly knows her position.

788
00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:32,318
She knows she's smart.

789
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:36,030
She knows she can use that
and that she's still a lot of use.

790
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:37,323
So, she just sits there

791
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:40,075
and lets others take care of things
without getting blood on her hands.

792
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:44,121
So we need to recognize So-hui
as a legitimate threat?

793
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:47,166
In her head,
So-hui may consider Hyun-gyu an enemy,

794
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:50,336
planning what to do
if she ends up playing against him.

795
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:52,880
We're not even in her sights
because we don't have many Pieces.

796
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:55,549
That's it. That's the sad part.

797
00:43:56,967 --> 00:44:00,554
All of our Pieces combined,
and we still don't outnumber any of them.

798
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:02,014
How many do we have? Seven?

799
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:04,058
It's four, two, two. That's all.

800
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:05,017
We have eight.

801
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:07,770
-What are you thinking?
-Right now?

802
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:10,981
Yes, are you going to keep
playing with the people here? Or…

803
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:11,899
Me?

804
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:13,776
What is your current mindset?

805
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:16,236
In any case,
this will break apart at some point.

806
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,989
When it does, it does. Of course.

807
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:20,115
That's a given.

808
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:21,450
But until that happens,

809
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:25,204
you're thinking of sticking together
and going for a resounding victory?

810
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:27,414
What I think will happen is this.

811
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:29,833
I mean, there's no guarantee we'll win,

812
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:34,088
but I think we're bound
to be divided later.

813
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:36,799
I don't think it's necessarily good.

814
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:38,509
Neither is it really advantageous.

815
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:41,637
We always have to send one of us away.

816
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:45,599
Even today, one of us may end up down
there while one of them comes up here.

817
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:48,519
I don't know if that'll be the case today,

818
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:51,146
but if I can get rid of someone,
it'd be Hyun-joon.

819
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:55,192
I think it's important
where you spend the night.

820
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:56,276
Yes, I think so too.

821
00:44:56,777 --> 00:45:01,115
They've been living here from the start,
and I was the only one that moved in.

822
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:05,619
So I couldn't help but feel
that them-versus-me feeling,

823
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:07,705
and I still feel it to some degree.

824
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:09,039
From the first day,

825
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:13,168
I wanted to bring the prison gang here
and get one of them eliminated.

826
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:17,131
But I've been very cautious
about trying anything like that

827
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:19,633
because if I get rid of one of them,

828
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:22,594
the rest of them in their alliance
will start targeting me.

829
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:25,222
So what I have to think about from now on

830
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:28,809
is whether I'll be able to beat those
who are left if I get rid of someone.

831
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:31,186
Once I figure that out, I'll make a move.

832
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:33,397
A tectonic shift has to happen. Quickly.

833
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:36,942
I think today's game is
going to be really intense.

834
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:38,318
I've got a feeling.

835
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:40,821
Kyuhyun, those feelings of yours
are always right.

836
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:44,450
What I'm most worried about is,
what if we have to play in teams of three?

837
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:46,285
-Oh, you're right.
-Three at the most.

838
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:47,453
Right.

839
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:49,788
Then one person will
just have to play separately.

840
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:50,789
Right.

841
00:45:51,373 --> 00:45:53,834
But you know, I don't think today's game

842
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:57,212
will be one where having few Pieces
will be a huge disadvantage.

843
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:58,255
Me too.

844
00:45:58,338 --> 00:46:00,841
Realistically, I consider
today's main match to be my death match.

845
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:02,426
So do I.

846
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:04,887
I think the same. All of us here
are hanging by a thread.

847
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:06,597
Exactly. Hanging by a thread.

848
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,307
Play another prison match tonight?

849
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:10,559
-That's not an option for me anymore.
-Me too.

850
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:11,769
I want my clothes back!

851
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:15,355
-I wanna go change.
-How can you say that in front of me?

852
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:19,276
Hey, I'm sorry to say this,
but those just feel like your clothes now.

853
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,320
-Oh, come on.
-Yeah.

854
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:24,364
I mean, you're the only one left
from the original prison members.

855
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:26,617
-Exactly.
-Hyun-joon is over on the other side.

856
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,243
He shimmied his way out.

857
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:29,578
"Shimmied his way out"?

858
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:31,497
Except for him, you're the only one left.

859
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,290
Yeah, that was his lifeline.

860
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:35,167
But about those in the living area…

861
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:39,004
I mean, what I don't understand is
that even after hearing about that,

862
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:42,299
-people don't seem to be wary of Hyun-gyu.
-Because Hyun-gyu was fixated on it.

863
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:44,760
He put a lot of effort
into opening that door.

864
00:46:44,843 --> 00:46:46,386
So when he actually opened it,

865
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:49,765
no one could
really oppose to him entering it.

866
00:46:49,848 --> 00:46:52,392
What I mean is… I can understand that.

867
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:56,355
The outcome was a hint
about the final match, right?

868
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:58,190
But if you think about it,

869
00:46:58,273 --> 00:47:01,360
you'll be playing against
only one in the final.

870
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:02,277
He's the worst.

871
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:05,656
So I keep thinking, "Shouldn't everyone
want to get rid of Hyun-gyu first?"

872
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:07,407
But it seems like nobody…

873
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:09,952
I'm alone in wondering why
no one wants to get rid of him.

874
00:47:10,035 --> 00:47:11,954
Well, he is really dealing well
with it politically.

875
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:12,871
Is he?

876
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:16,959
But I think people will
try to keep him in check today.

877
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:18,794
-Hyun-gyu?
-Yes, Hyun-gyu.

878
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:21,630
I mean, if you think about the final,

879
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:24,633
-getting rid of Hyun-gyu is only right.
-He has to go!

880
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:27,052
He's the one to get rid of
before the final.

881
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:30,013
That's why I was thinking it would've
been great if he'd ended up here.

882
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:31,139
That's so funny.

883
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:34,059
So what I wanted to say to both of you

884
00:47:34,142 --> 00:47:36,937
is that I want
to get one of them to join us.

885
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,939
-That's what I keep saying.
-So who?

886
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:39,898
Hyun-joon.

887
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:41,733
Is that possible?

888
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:43,151
-Hyun-joon?
-Hyun-joon?

889
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:46,488
For me, Hyun-joon is the one person
I think I could win over.

890
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:50,784
Hyun-joon is the one person who has
always been consistent, at least to me.

891
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:54,037
Don't you think Hyun-joon might
feel like he's joining a daycare center?

892
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:56,081
-What's that?
-The 2-2-4 daycare center.

893
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:57,875
He has to work to keep us fed.

894
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:00,043
We'll convince him by saying,

895
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:04,256
"Hyun-joon, you have the most Pieces,
so you're going to end up in the final."

896
00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:06,592
"Do you want to end up in the final
with Hyun-gyu?"

897
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:09,720
We have to tell him that working
with Hyun-gyu is not so good for him.

898
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:11,430
"You're most likely going to the final."

899
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:13,682
"If you keep playing with Hyun-gyu,

900
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:16,476
you're helping him get to the final,
like a pushover."

901
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,437
"Is that what you want?"
That should be our take.

902
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,147
Or how about I go there and he comes here?

903
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:22,649
No, Hyun-gyu won't come. He'll never come.

904
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:24,610
-Hyun-gyu will never come here.
-Never.

905
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:27,863
He will stick to the people
that are most beneficial to him.

906
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:30,699
However, Kyuhyun doesn't
have much leverage over there.

907
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:31,867
Out of the four of them.

908
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:34,912
-True.
-So, Kyuhyun is most likely to join us.

909
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:37,706
It's great if he joined us,
but I think he's dangerous.

910
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:39,958
-He might spy on us.
-I don't trust him at all.

911
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:42,002
Kyuhyun might play both sides.

912
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:43,795
I don't trust him. Let me just reiterate,

913
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:47,382
he's already screwed me over twice,
so I'm not inclined to trust him again.

914
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:49,676
I have no reason to trust him.

915
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,138
What can he do?
What can he do to regain your trust?

916
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:55,015
He can't. I don't think it's possible.

917
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:56,391
It's in shambles.

918
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:59,102
I'm going to go and wash up.

919
00:49:03,398 --> 00:49:06,193
It fits slightly different,
even though it looks the same.

920
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:07,611
How's this outfit?

921
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:11,281
I'll give you the once-over.

922
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,743
Asking about the same exact attire.

923
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:22,167
-The main match will begin shortly.
-I'm sure they're so determined.

924
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:25,337
All players,
please gather in the game area.

925
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,089
-Good luck.
-Good luck.

926
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:28,674
Has everyone got their Pieces?

927
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:30,342
-Yes.
-Yes, I've got mine.

928
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:34,054
Do I look okay?
I didn't look in the mirror.

929
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:37,224
-No, you don't look weird. Not at all.
-You look fine.

930
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:38,976
-What's this?
-What do we have here?

931
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:42,896
Let's see, white and black.

932
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:46,441
This one has a D and this one an A,
so I guess it's "devils" and "angels."

933
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:49,194
Three colors. Each in turn.

934
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:52,406
Morning.

935
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:53,490
-Morning.
-Hey.

936
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:55,409
-Can I get a protein drink too?
-Thanks.

937
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:56,910
Here you are, Ji-yeong.

938
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:58,704
-Did you sleep well?
-This tastes good.

939
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:01,456
-That was so cool. The Zero.
-Thanks.

940
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,417
I bet it was tough seeing Tinno go.

941
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:07,129
It is what it is. In a game like that,
it could happen to anyone.

942
00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:10,007
We had to get rid of him.
I did it all for you guys.

943
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:11,299
Tinno was a strong player.

944
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:12,217
Good morning.

945
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:16,972
The fifth main match
of The Devil's Plan will begin now.

946
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:20,767
Tinno was eliminated
in last night's prison match,

947
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:24,980
and now only seven of you remain.

948
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:26,773
Before the game begins,

949
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:30,277
here is the current Piece count
of each player now.

950
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:35,532
Currently,
Choi Hyun-joon has the most Pieces.

951
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:39,870
Here are the rules of today's main match.

952
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:43,665
The fifth main match
of The Devil's Plan is

953
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:45,667
Balance Mancala.

954
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:46,585
Mancala?

955
00:50:46,668 --> 00:50:48,211
Balance Mancala is a game

956
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:50,797
where you have to move
your own and opponent's counters

957
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:54,801
to collect three types
of color points evenly.

958
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:57,804
The board consists of 14 spaces in total,

959
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:02,225
12 color spaces and 2 special spaces.

960
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:05,937
The color spaces are
either red, blue or green,

961
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:09,024
and they are arranged in order.

962
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:12,944
The special spaces are one angel space

963
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:15,072
and one devil space.

964
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:16,865
Before the game begins,

965
00:51:16,948 --> 00:51:19,868
players shall draw lots
to decide the order of play,

966
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:23,914
and each player shall
be given four counters.

967
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:28,126
Once the order has been decided,
beginning with whoever is going first,

968
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:31,088
players shall place
their counters on the board in turn.

969
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:35,884
This process shall be repeated four times
until all counters are on the board.

970
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:40,680
At this time, no more than two counters
can be on any one space.

971
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:44,017
Once all counters are placed,
the game shall begin.

972
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:48,730
The first player shall choose
a space with one of their counters on,

973
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:51,066
pick up all the counters on that space,

974
00:51:51,149 --> 00:51:56,196
and place them one by one on the next
spaces in a clockwise direction.

975
00:51:56,863 --> 00:51:59,533
When they place the final counter
in their hand on the board,

976
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,868
the owner of that counter shall be

977
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:05,163
awarded points corresponding
to the number of counters on that space

978
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:07,332
and to the color of that space.

979
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:09,042
For example,

980
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:13,839
player A picks up two counters from
a red space containing one of his counters

981
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:16,341
and places them
one each on the next two spaces.

982
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:19,261
The last counter he places
belongs to player C

983
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:21,221
and is placed on a green space

984
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:24,141
that already
contains three other counters.

985
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:28,520
In this case, player C
is awarded four green points

986
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:31,356
by the total number of counters
on the space including his own.

987
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:34,693
If the last counter is placed
on one of the two special spaces,

988
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:37,654
points are awarded in the following way.

989
00:52:37,737 --> 00:52:38,989
The angel space.

990
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:41,241
The owner of the counter is awarded

991
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:43,285
a number of points
equal to the number of counters

992
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:46,371
on the angel space in
the color of which they have least points.

993
00:52:47,622 --> 00:52:48,832
The devil space.

994
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:51,251
The owner of the counter is awarded

995
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:53,170
a number of points
equal to the number of counters

996
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:56,756
on the devil space in
the color of which they have most points.

997
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:01,928
If more than one color is eligible
to score points from a special space,

998
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:05,473
the player that moved
the counter shall choose the color.

999
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:10,645
As players move their and their opponents'
counters around the board,

1000
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:13,481
they must endeavor to
maintain balance between their scores.

1001
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:17,444
If any one player reaches 30 points
in any one color,

1002
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:21,114
the game shall end immediately.

1003
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:23,617
When the game is over,

1004
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,952
each player's final score
shall be calculated

1005
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:28,038
based on their color scores.

1006
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:30,498
FINAL SCORE
FEWEST COLOR - (MOST COLOR - FEWEST COLOR)

1007
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:35,545
The final score equals the difference
of the player's highest and lowest score,

1008
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:39,174
subtracted from their lowest score.

1009
00:53:39,257 --> 00:53:43,386
Thus, you must accrue evenly high points
across all three colors

1010
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:46,264
to get a high final score.

1011
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:50,852
Any player with 15 points or less
when the game ends

1012
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:54,022
shall forfeit half of
their Pieces as a penalty.

1013
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:58,735
Finally, the player
with the highest final score

1014
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:04,574
shall take five Pieces from
the player with the lowest final score.

1015
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:08,745
If that player does not have five Pieces,

1016
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:11,665
they will give up
all their remaining Pieces.

1017
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:16,378
Today's prize mission will be revealed
after the end of Round 5.

1018
00:54:17,003 --> 00:54:18,213
Oh, my God.

1019
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:19,422
Before the game begins,

1020
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:23,093
players shall draw lots
to determine the order of play.

1021
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:24,386
I will now conduct the draw.

1022
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:26,721
-The order seems to be very important.
-Exactly.

1023
00:54:35,188 --> 00:54:39,109
The game will start in one hour.

1024
00:54:39,192 --> 00:54:42,320
Spend this time as you wish.

1025
00:54:42,404 --> 00:54:44,739
Since anyone
that fails to get over 15 points

1026
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:47,534
has to give up half of their Pieces,

1027
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:49,744
I think I'll have to keep on my toes

1028
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:51,955
even while playing as part of an alliance.

1029
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:54,165
Giving up half of our Pieces
is tough for us,

1030
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:56,668
but it's even worse
for those with more Pieces.

1031
00:54:56,751 --> 00:55:01,756
So I think this game provides us
with a golden opportunity.

1032
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,842
The game is called Balance Mancala,

1033
00:55:03,925 --> 00:55:07,470
and I hope it'll make
all the players balance out.

1034
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:09,431
I think this is about taking Pieces.

1035
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:11,516
Exactly. There's no way
to spend our Pieces.

1036
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:14,811
Because you lose half,
those guys don't have much to lose.

1037
00:55:14,894 --> 00:55:16,688
If you have three Pieces,
you only lose one.

1038
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:19,441
-So the more you have, the more you lose.
-Right.

1039
00:55:19,524 --> 00:55:22,068
You lose Pieces
if you get less than 15 points,

1040
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:25,572
and if you finish last, you lose
more Pieces, so it could be the end.

1041
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:28,408
If a player's final score is
15 points or less,

1042
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:30,493
they lose half of their Pieces.

1043
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:35,623
Whoever finishes last
will also lose an additional five Pieces.

1044
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:39,377
If no players exceed 15 points,

1045
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:41,755
the Pieces count will change as follows.

1046
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:47,135
The results of this game will cause
fluctuations in the current standings.

1047
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:49,596
-If you lose half and then five more…
-It's over.

1048
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:52,223
I calculated it and it's big.
How many Pieces do you have?

1049
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:53,600
-Eight?
-Eight. I'd be dead.

1050
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:55,143
Exactly, this is huge.

1051
00:55:55,226 --> 00:55:58,229
Hyun-joon, you have 13, right?
So, you'd lose 6.

1052
00:55:58,313 --> 00:56:00,357
-That'd put you in danger.
-It's dangerous.

1053
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:03,151
-We must take first place.
-Right. One of us has to get it.

1054
00:56:03,234 --> 00:56:04,527
One of us must.

1055
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:06,237
The order is important

1056
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:09,407
because your moves will be determined

1057
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:12,077
to some extent
by where they put your counters.

1058
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,120
So it's a game of negotiation

1059
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:17,123
with the person ahead of you

1060
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:19,209
and the person who follows you.

1061
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:21,378
Balance Mancala

1062
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:24,881
sees each player choosing one of the
spaces containing one of their counters

1063
00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:27,467
and picking up all the counters it holds,

1064
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:30,261
and placing them one at a time
clockwise starting in the next spaces,

1065
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:34,808
with the person whose counter is placed
last getting a number of points equivalent

1066
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:38,103
to the number of counters in that space
in the color of that space.

1067
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:43,108
The last counter you place
doesn't need to be your own.

1068
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:48,988
In other words, you can help or hinder
other players by giving them points.

1069
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:52,242
My strategy is
to provoke the guys at the top

1070
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:54,994
and tell them this is the only
chance to send them somewhere else.

1071
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:57,997
And it's best if we get that.
So we say, "You make me win."

1072
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:01,668
"And if you make me win,
I'll take their Pieces for you."

1073
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:02,752
Right, to Hyun-joon.

1074
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:05,880
After that, we decide later
who to take from. Okay?

1075
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:07,757
Who we'll take from? Exactly.

1076
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:12,220
We'll decide who to kill.
Because it never works out as promised.

1077
00:57:13,012 --> 00:57:16,850
With nothing to lose and full of spite,
we've been in prison for a long time.

1078
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:19,185
So we've started to feel
we have nothing to lose,

1079
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:21,479
and we were starting to just let loose.

1080
00:57:21,563 --> 00:57:23,857
So you and I have to attack No. 3.
Who is that?

1081
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:25,191
Who is No. 3?

1082
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:26,568
Let's find out.

1083
00:57:26,651 --> 00:57:28,695
But how come they already
made their alliance?

1084
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:33,533
Can we come in
and check everyone's numbers?

1085
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:35,118
-Sure.
-Let's see your numbers.

1086
00:57:35,201 --> 00:57:37,036
Oh, I'm No. 6.

1087
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,705
Hyun-joon, we need to do a lot of talking.

1088
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:39,873
Who's No. 1?

1089
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:41,416
-Hyun-gyu.
-So-hui is No. 3.

1090
00:57:41,499 --> 00:57:43,877
-So-hui is No. 3?
-Yes, No. 3.

1091
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:47,130
So-hui, can we talk for a minute?

1092
00:57:47,213 --> 00:57:48,173
Why?

1093
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:51,593
What's your objective for this game?

1094
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:53,720
-My objective for this game?
-Yes.

1095
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:55,138
Not to lose any Pieces.

1096
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:57,724
-Not to lose any Pieces? To play defense?
-Yes.

1097
00:57:57,807 --> 00:58:02,604
Then help either me or Eun-yu win.

1098
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:04,564
How?

1099
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:06,733
This is the kind of game

1100
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:10,528
that allows us to band together
and screw whoever we want.

1101
00:58:10,612 --> 00:58:11,821
Then it's game over.

1102
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:13,698
We can control the points.

1103
00:58:13,781 --> 00:58:15,116
Okay, just between us?

1104
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,202
Yes, you help us control the points.

1105
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:20,121
Give points to whoever we decide.

1106
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:22,373
Then what we can do for you

1107
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:24,792
is take five Pieces from
whichever player you decide.

1108
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:28,838
So-hui, right now,
you should take five Pieces off

1109
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:31,007
whichever player you want to keep at bay.

1110
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:33,134
It's better for you
to have more Pieces than them.

1111
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:34,511
-That's true.
-Right?

1112
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:38,389
Okay, I think it's okay to do
what you say and take five,

1113
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:41,726
but we already agreed
to play together today,

1114
00:58:41,809 --> 00:58:42,852
so I'll talk to them.

1115
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:45,313
No, what you need to understand is that

1116
00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:49,150
you're sandwiched between us, so
we have some degree of control over you.

1117
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:51,861
So what I'm saying is,
we can work together in peace,

1118
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:53,696
or we will play as enemies.

1119
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:55,532
That's what I wanted to ask you.

1120
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:57,242
Of course I'd rather be at peace.

1121
00:58:57,325 --> 00:59:00,578
Then you can't work with them
because we have to take from them.

1122
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:03,623
Do you understand?
Our target has to be one of these three.

1123
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:05,250
Then I choose him.

1124
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:07,627
-You want to attack Hyun-joon?
-Hyun-joon.

1125
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:11,756
-But let me talk it over with them first.
-Oh, that doesn't matter.

1126
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:15,385
But if you say no,
then we'll have to find another strategy.

1127
00:59:15,468 --> 00:59:19,931
But as I said just now,
if you decide to do it,

1128
00:59:20,014 --> 00:59:21,808
we'll be really strong.

1129
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:23,101
This is the strongest.

1130
00:59:23,184 --> 00:59:24,811
If we do this,

1131
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:26,354
we'll be even stronger.

1132
00:59:26,437 --> 00:59:27,814
Then let's include him.

1133
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:29,691
Going one after another is much stronger.

1134
00:59:29,774 --> 00:59:31,150
-Include Kyuhyun?
-Yes.

1135
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:33,236
He's really been
wanting to play with Eun-yu.

1136
00:59:33,319 --> 00:59:35,822
-So, you want to play like this?
-Yes, that'll be better.

1137
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,659
So what are you going to do?

1138
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:41,869
Yes, we have to fall apart at some point.

1139
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:44,706
Of course you do!
I really don't understand.

1140
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:47,709
What good is killing us? We have no power.

1141
00:59:47,792 --> 00:59:49,711
It's time for you
to start going after each other.

1142
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:57,010
If it gets to a certain point,
it'll make a big difference.

1143
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:58,052
From ten points…

1144
00:59:58,136 --> 01:00:00,013
If we do it like this…

1145
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:01,973
-Yes.
-…we can kill one of these two.

1146
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:04,976
If we band together like this,

1147
01:00:05,059 --> 01:00:06,978
we can control the points however we want.

1148
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:08,438
Let's do it.

1149
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:14,777
If we do this,
you can keep your Pieces and take others'.

1150
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:18,114
You have to keep them at bay.
Hey, one has a hint about how to win,

1151
01:00:18,197 --> 01:00:21,075
and one has,
what, twelve or thirteen Pieces.

1152
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:22,201
What are you going to do?

1153
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:25,121
All you'll be doing is being stuck
between them waiting to die.

1154
01:00:25,204 --> 01:00:26,289
So-hui has 11 as well.

1155
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:29,876
So you have to reign them in.
All the more reason to.

1156
01:00:34,505 --> 01:00:37,550
As long as you're not
looking to keep So-hui at bay.

1157
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:46,601
I need to think it over.

1158
01:00:46,684 --> 01:00:47,518
Okay.

1159
01:01:03,242 --> 01:01:05,411
I think this is the perfect time
to get rid of Hyun-gyu.

1160
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:07,288
-Fill me in too.
-Right.

1161
01:01:07,372 --> 01:01:08,873
The order is bad for Hyun-gyu.

1162
01:01:08,956 --> 01:01:10,291
So, I went over there.

1163
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:11,918
I asked So-hui,

1164
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:15,338
and what she said was
to include Kyuhyun as well.

1165
01:01:15,421 --> 01:01:17,632
The four of us together, like this.

1166
01:01:17,715 --> 01:01:19,384
And we can control here at the end.

1167
01:01:19,467 --> 01:01:22,011
Then we can definitely kill these two.

1168
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:24,430
But if we go with him as well,
we can control all of this.

1169
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:27,809
But see here. The problem is
that So-hui wants to kill him.

1170
01:01:27,892 --> 01:01:29,227
Not Hyun-gyu?

1171
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:32,772
What do you think?

1172
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:37,694
He's not wrong. He makes a lot of sense.

1173
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:40,238
Yes, I think that might be better.

1174
01:01:40,321 --> 01:01:43,366
Because if we stick together,
we'll just end up fighting each other.

1175
01:01:43,449 --> 01:01:44,867
-That's true.
-Yes.

1176
01:01:47,328 --> 01:01:48,538
This is going to be fun.

1177
01:01:48,621 --> 01:01:49,580
Today?

1178
01:01:50,164 --> 01:01:51,165
What is it?

1179
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:53,835
-What is it?
-What do you mean?

1180
01:01:53,918 --> 01:01:54,961
It's not easy.

1181
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:55,920
Why not?

1182
01:01:56,003 --> 01:01:58,214
This is not the sort of game
we were expecting.

1183
01:01:58,297 --> 01:02:01,092
Well, I was expecting big changes today.

1184
01:02:01,175 --> 01:02:03,094
-I suppose. They won't stand still.
-Right.

1185
01:02:03,177 --> 01:02:05,138
Well, we just need to play fair.

1186
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:07,014
If they cause a fuss, then we stop them.

1187
01:02:07,098 --> 01:02:10,309
We're all under the same conditions,
so isn't it a fair fight?

1188
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:11,561
Honestly,

1189
01:02:11,644 --> 01:02:15,356
I didn't want to be
on the opposing side of Hyun-gyu,

1190
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:19,277
and I didn't want to feel
like I was betraying him, so…

1191
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:20,611
This is driving me crazy.

1192
01:02:21,195 --> 01:02:25,616
But Hyun-gyu also thinks
similarly about us.

1193
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:26,534
That's what I'm saying.

1194
01:02:26,617 --> 01:02:27,910
So that's the point.

1195
01:02:27,994 --> 01:02:31,289
Do we keep playing as good people

1196
01:02:31,372 --> 01:02:34,292
by staying loyal and not betraying him,

1197
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:37,295
and go down in glory
on the verge of the final?

1198
01:02:37,378 --> 01:02:40,715
Or do we turn bad and stab him in the back

1199
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:43,634
to increase our chances
of getting to the final?

1200
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:48,139
Can we talk for a moment?

1201
01:02:48,222 --> 01:02:49,056
Okay.

1202
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:51,726
Hyun-joon, give us a moment?

1203
01:02:55,563 --> 01:02:56,439
Hyun-gyu.

1204
01:02:56,522 --> 01:02:59,025
Are they joining hands? 7high and Kyuhyun?

1205
01:02:59,108 --> 01:03:01,235
-Well, then so be it.
-We just have to play.

1206
01:03:02,904 --> 01:03:04,822
Are they forming an alliance now?

1207
01:03:04,906 --> 01:03:06,240
They told me to get lost.

1208
01:03:06,324 --> 01:03:08,993
-Did they?
-Doesn't that mean they're an alliance?

1209
01:03:09,076 --> 01:03:10,828
I guess I'm the target. Of course.

1210
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:13,498
-Because you have a lot of Pieces.
-I suppose.

1211
01:03:13,581 --> 01:03:14,499
Come over here.

1212
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:18,711
Can No. 4 and No. 6 communicate?
You and me? Because we're one apart.

1213
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:21,547
I think me and Kyuhyun at No. 5
will be talking a lot.

1214
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:22,757
What do you want to do?

1215
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:25,051
I need you to negotiate with Kyuhyun.

1216
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:27,762
Well, I'm not sure about Kyuhyun.
Why has he gone in there?

1217
01:03:27,845 --> 01:03:29,388
Is he trying to screw me over?

1218
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:32,934
To be frank, what you're right about
is that if we join you,

1219
01:03:33,017 --> 01:03:35,645
we can ensure that we stay
in the living area tonight.

1220
01:03:35,728 --> 01:03:38,189
And the chance that one of us
gets to the final increases.

1221
01:03:38,272 --> 01:03:43,194
Right, but in truth, Hyun-gyu really
trusts us and is relying on us a lot.

1222
01:03:43,277 --> 01:03:46,656
So are we going to betray his trust

1223
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:49,116
so one of the two of us
can get to the final?

1224
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,035
-Or…
-Wait, but I--

1225
01:03:51,118 --> 01:03:52,245
I know what you mean.

1226
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:55,540
It's not that. I think there's
a flaw in that way of thinking.

1227
01:03:55,623 --> 01:03:58,334
Why can't you be good friends if you win?

1228
01:03:58,417 --> 01:04:01,754
In any case, we're playing games
to decide only one winner.

1229
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:04,590
Why do you keep bringing
these kinds of feelings into it?

1230
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:06,050
When he said those things,

1231
01:04:06,133 --> 01:04:09,220
I can't help but agree with him. Because…

1232
01:04:09,303 --> 01:04:12,807
If you're aiming to win this show,
shouldn't you crush these two?

1233
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:15,601
Even if we help you, two of us
will go back to prison again anyway.

1234
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:18,688
Even if we get some Pieces,
we still might end up in prison.

1235
01:04:18,771 --> 01:04:20,773
If either of us gets five Pieces,
then we'd have seven.

1236
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:22,066
-That's still prison.
-He's right.

1237
01:04:22,149 --> 01:04:24,610
And Hyun-gyu even has
a hint about the final match.

1238
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:27,613
Yes, he has some kind of advantage,
but he hasn't told us what it is.

1239
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:28,990
If you're here to win,

1240
01:04:29,073 --> 01:04:31,993
you must weaken these two now.

1241
01:04:32,076 --> 01:04:34,328
Otherwise, how on earth
are you planning to win?

1242
01:04:34,412 --> 01:04:36,622
In any case, I came here thinking,

1243
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:40,376
"I want to go all the way
without betraying anyone,"

1244
01:04:40,459 --> 01:04:43,671
but now I'm thinking, "I don't
want to just be seen as a good person."

1245
01:04:43,754 --> 01:04:47,425
I don't want people
thinking I'm just a fool.

1246
01:04:47,508 --> 01:04:50,219
That would be
disrespectful to the other players.

1247
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:52,597
He's not wrong.
In fact, he's exactly right.

1248
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:55,141
Doing that to be safe.

1249
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:59,020
I could win or at least have
a chance to make it to the final,

1250
01:04:59,103 --> 01:05:00,187
and if I don't take it,

1251
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:03,482
the people watching this show
will probably think I'm a fool.

1252
01:05:07,028 --> 01:05:08,321
Then shall we join them?

1253
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:11,157
Just wait here a second.

1254
01:05:15,369 --> 01:05:17,163
-Those guys…
-Yes?

1255
01:05:17,246 --> 01:05:21,417
…keep saying, "Are you just here as a
peanut gallery? Don't you want to win?"

1256
01:05:22,209 --> 01:05:23,586
Damn it.

1257
01:05:23,669 --> 01:05:25,463
What they're saying is right. It is.

1258
01:05:25,546 --> 01:05:27,798
You do whatever you think is right.
So-hui as well.

1259
01:05:29,967 --> 01:05:32,178
-You know what I'm like.
-Yes, I know.

1260
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:33,930
So just do whatever you want.

1261
01:05:35,014 --> 01:05:36,515
Then can I go for it today?

1262
01:05:37,058 --> 01:05:38,059
Of course.

1263
01:05:38,643 --> 01:05:40,895
-Are you sure?
-Yes, if you want to, go for it.

1264
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:44,398
-Just us two will work together.
-What?

1265
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:46,067
Let's work together today.

1266
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:48,152
I'll join you of course,
because I promised you.

1267
01:05:48,235 --> 01:05:50,029
-I think they're ganging up on us.
-What?

1268
01:05:50,112 --> 01:05:51,238
They're ganging up on us.

1269
01:05:51,322 --> 01:05:53,240
Then we're going to see
how far we can take it.

1270
01:05:53,324 --> 01:05:54,367
Of course.

1271
01:05:57,828 --> 01:05:59,789
-So we're definitely in the crosshairs?
-I think so.

1272
01:05:59,872 --> 01:06:01,248
-All right.
-I think so.

1273
01:06:01,332 --> 01:06:03,459
We'd be idiotic if we don't do this here.

1274
01:06:03,542 --> 01:06:05,252
-I understand. I get it.
-Right?

1275
01:06:05,336 --> 01:06:08,631
Okay. I feel a lot better now.

1276
01:06:08,714 --> 01:06:11,050
Well, I might get betrayed later,

1277
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:13,761
and if I do, I've brought it
upon myself, I think.

1278
01:06:13,844 --> 01:06:16,472
For now I'm just going
to focus on winning today.

1279
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:27,566
Let's do it.

1280
01:06:29,151 --> 01:06:31,404
-How did you leave things?
-It's over. I told them.

1281
01:06:31,487 --> 01:06:32,947
What did you tell Hyun-joon and Hyun-gyu?

1282
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:34,824
That we'll attack one of the two.

1283
01:06:34,907 --> 01:06:36,200
We can get both of them.

1284
01:06:36,283 --> 01:06:38,995
Make one finish last
and the other lose half of their Pieces.

1285
01:06:39,078 --> 01:06:42,373
But I don't think
their alliance will work well.

1286
01:06:42,456 --> 01:06:46,502
They have to make sure
they allocate their colors properly.

1287
01:06:46,585 --> 01:06:49,213
So, there's no need for us to be scared.

1288
01:06:49,296 --> 01:06:50,965
I'm not scared, just…

1289
01:06:51,048 --> 01:06:54,260
Do you know what's actually
more advantageous to us?

1290
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:56,679
As they try and get us,
we might get more points.

1291
01:06:56,762 --> 01:06:59,890
So we should put as many of
our remaining counters as possible here,

1292
01:06:59,974 --> 01:07:01,058
on the angel space.

1293
01:07:01,142 --> 01:07:05,563
-For us to come here?
-Yes. This is kind of like a potion to us.

1294
01:07:06,564 --> 01:07:09,358
The angel space adds
the number of points equivalent

1295
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:12,653
to the number of counters on it
to whichever color is your lowest score,

1296
01:07:12,737 --> 01:07:14,572
helping to maintain a balanced score.

1297
01:07:14,655 --> 01:07:16,073
On the devil space,

1298
01:07:16,157 --> 01:07:20,327
it adds a score equivalent to the number
of counters on it to your highest score,

1299
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:22,663
which could ruin your scores balance.

1300
01:07:22,747 --> 01:07:25,708
Making use of the angel and devil spaces

1301
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:29,128
is the key to this
battle of unequal alliances.

1302
01:07:30,212 --> 01:07:34,467
If we want to cover all possibilities,
we need to split up as much as possible.

1303
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:36,594
We should be spread out
over all 14 spaces,

1304
01:07:37,094 --> 01:07:39,388
Right. Because
we have to get their counters.

1305
01:07:39,472 --> 01:07:40,473
Right.

1306
01:07:40,556 --> 01:07:41,474
Since we have 20,

1307
01:07:41,557 --> 01:07:44,268
we should put the remaining six
around the devil and angel ones.

1308
01:07:44,351 --> 01:07:46,353
But I don't think they'll put them here.

1309
01:07:46,437 --> 01:07:49,565
I think they'll avoid
the three spaces before the devil one.

1310
01:07:49,648 --> 01:07:52,526
You mean since it plays clockwise,
they'll avoid this area?

1311
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:54,445
And target this area, right?

1312
01:07:54,528 --> 01:07:55,446
At least initially.

1313
01:07:55,529 --> 01:07:58,074
They'll try to put them clockwise
after the devil space.

1314
01:07:58,157 --> 01:07:59,575
First, get some points on the board.

1315
01:07:59,658 --> 01:08:01,744
And when we think
our points are under control,

1316
01:08:01,827 --> 01:08:03,829
we'll keep pushing them
on to the devil space.

1317
01:08:04,413 --> 01:08:06,499
Your time is up.

1318
01:08:06,582 --> 01:08:08,793
All players, please assemble in the hall.

1319
01:08:08,876 --> 01:08:11,629
Balance Mancala will now begin.

1320
01:08:12,213 --> 01:08:13,714
You will now place your counters.

1321
01:08:14,215 --> 01:08:17,426
Jeong Hyun-gyu, the first player,
please place your counter one at a time.

1322
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:18,636
I'm so curious.

1323
01:08:20,554 --> 01:08:22,348
I thought he might do that.

1324
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:24,683
7high, please place your counter.

1325
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:27,394
Yun So-hui.

1326
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:29,188
Son Eun-yu.

1327
01:08:30,022 --> 01:08:30,898
Kyuhyun.

1328
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:32,858
Choi Hyun-joon.

1329
01:08:33,651 --> 01:08:34,610
Kang Ji-yeong.

1330
01:08:35,694 --> 01:08:38,072
Jeong Hyun-gyu,
please place your second counter.

1331
01:08:43,869 --> 01:08:45,079
Why put them all there?

1332
01:08:45,162 --> 01:08:46,914
I want to keep two together

1333
01:08:46,997 --> 01:08:48,707
-then spread them out.
-Spread them out?

1334
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:49,708
Choi Hyun-joon.

1335
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:54,672
Jeong Hyun-gyu,
please place your third counter.

1336
01:09:01,053 --> 01:09:03,472
Green, red, blue.

1337
01:09:04,014 --> 01:09:06,016
You will now place
your fourth and final counter.

1338
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:07,643
Jeong Hyun-gyu will go first.

1339
01:09:09,687 --> 01:09:10,938
He's smart.

1340
01:09:11,021 --> 01:09:13,315
-That's what I was thinking.
-He's indeed smart.

1341
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:16,193
Since the devil space is here
and it's clockwise,

1342
01:09:16,277 --> 01:09:18,195
we thought Hyun-gyu would
put them this side.

1343
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:20,197
But he did something totally unexpected.

1344
01:09:20,281 --> 01:09:22,324
Wow, that was really smart.

1345
01:09:22,408 --> 01:09:24,535
Since everyone is all spread out anyway.

1346
01:09:24,618 --> 01:09:26,245
At first it's fine to land on the devil.

1347
01:09:26,328 --> 01:09:27,329
7high.

1348
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:29,707
Then where don't I have covered?

1349
01:09:35,379 --> 01:09:36,672
I don't have any choice.

1350
01:09:39,758 --> 01:09:41,552
Round 1 will now begin.

1351
01:09:41,635 --> 01:09:43,721
Jeong Hyun-gyu will go first.

1352
01:09:43,804 --> 01:09:45,306
Please move the counters.

1353
01:09:51,979 --> 01:09:55,149
Jeong Hyun-gyu gets three blue points.

1354
01:09:55,232 --> 01:09:57,526
We must make him keep
getting points on that color.

1355
01:09:57,610 --> 01:09:59,445
Whatever we do, it has to be blue.

1356
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:02,031
It is now 7high's turn.
Please move the counters.

1357
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:09,830
So-hui is No. 3,
so it's best for her to get the points.

1358
01:10:18,923 --> 01:10:22,593
Jeong Hyun-gyu gets four red points.

1359
01:10:22,676 --> 01:10:25,095
It is now Yoon So-hui's turn.
Please move the counters.

1360
01:10:31,936 --> 01:10:34,897
Yoon So-hui gets three red points.

1361
01:10:35,814 --> 01:10:38,609
What? That wasn't the plan.
Why didn't you move that one?

1362
01:10:38,692 --> 01:10:40,819
I told you to move that one.

1363
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:43,447
I didn't know you meant that one.

1364
01:10:44,323 --> 01:10:46,659
We're still in the early stages,
so it's okay.

1365
01:10:46,742 --> 01:10:49,245
But I set that up
for you to get points, okay?

1366
01:10:49,328 --> 01:10:51,622
Now they can get
whatever points they want.

1367
01:10:52,122 --> 01:10:54,083
Son Eun-yu, please move the counters.

1368
01:10:58,504 --> 01:11:01,465
Son Eun-yu gets three blue points.

1369
01:11:01,548 --> 01:11:03,759
Kyuhyun, please move the counters.

1370
01:11:05,678 --> 01:11:07,012
It's a pointless move.

1371
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:09,265
I think it'd be better
not having a lot on the angel.

1372
01:11:09,348 --> 01:11:10,975
Yes, I think so too. That will be better.

1373
01:11:11,058 --> 01:11:14,812
Kyuhyun gets one point on blue.

1374
01:11:14,895 --> 01:11:18,315
Choi Hyun-joon, please move the counters.

1375
01:11:18,399 --> 01:11:21,860
Hyun-gyu had three on blue,
and we ended up giving him four on red.

1376
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:24,655
Right now, Hyun-gyu will
be looking to get green points.

1377
01:11:24,738 --> 01:11:27,116
But Hyun-gyu has no way
to get green points.

1378
01:11:28,075 --> 01:11:29,285
Break up those four.

1379
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:33,330
See. There aren't
enough greens at the moment.

1380
01:11:34,164 --> 01:11:35,791
Okay, I'll split this one up.

1381
01:11:38,711 --> 01:11:39,753
Put me here.

1382
01:11:39,837 --> 01:11:42,214
Then I'll put you here.
And I'll have this one.

1383
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:44,049
Damn it.

1384
01:11:45,384 --> 01:11:48,554
One, two, three. He comes here.
He's getting green points.

1385
01:11:48,637 --> 01:11:49,680
When he's No. 1?

1386
01:11:49,763 --> 01:11:51,932
Like that. So giving them
an opportunity like that…

1387
01:11:52,433 --> 01:11:54,852
We can't gather a lot
where Hyun-gyu and Hyun-joon are

1388
01:11:54,935 --> 01:11:56,186
because they can move further.

1389
01:11:56,270 --> 01:11:57,730
This game is fun.

1390
01:11:57,813 --> 01:11:59,648
I need this. I don't have any points.

1391
01:12:00,274 --> 01:12:01,150
It's still early.

1392
01:12:01,233 --> 01:12:02,651
Still, I've got to be certain.

1393
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:04,862
We have to keep giving both of them blue.

1394
01:12:04,945 --> 01:12:07,031
Choi Hyun-joon gets four points on blue.

1395
01:12:07,114 --> 01:12:08,991
Kang Ji-yeong, please move the counters.

1396
01:12:09,074 --> 01:12:11,452
Yes, put them there and get some points.

1397
01:12:13,704 --> 01:12:16,749
Kang Ji-yeong gets four points on red.

1398
01:12:16,832 --> 01:12:18,542
That concludes Round 1.

1399
01:12:18,625 --> 01:12:19,460
Okay.

1400
01:12:20,961 --> 01:12:22,755
Round 2 will now begin.

1401
01:12:22,838 --> 01:12:24,798
Jeong Hyun-gyu, please move the counters.

1402
01:12:31,930 --> 01:12:34,767
Jeong Hyun-gyu gets three green points.

1403
01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:36,018
Nice and neat.

1404
01:12:36,727 --> 01:12:39,855
For now, we have to be
greedy and get lots of points.

1405
01:12:39,938 --> 01:12:41,648
I'll try and get a lot.

1406
01:12:41,732 --> 01:12:44,026
But we can't give them
too many points either.

1407
01:12:44,109 --> 01:12:45,235
-Yes, right.
-It's dangerous.

1408
01:12:45,319 --> 01:12:47,780
Yes, so we need to do that
towards the end.

1409
01:12:47,863 --> 01:12:49,656
7high, please move the counters.

1410
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:53,285
Hey, at the beginning,
we need to get points for ourselves.

1411
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:56,455
Yes, right. That's what I'm thinking.
Just keep tabs on them.

1412
01:13:01,085 --> 01:13:04,046
7high gets five green points.

1413
01:13:04,129 --> 01:13:05,631
Oh, you got a lot.

1414
01:13:05,714 --> 01:13:08,008
It is now Yoon So-hui's turn.
please move the counters.

1415
01:13:10,928 --> 01:13:11,845
Leave them together.

1416
01:13:11,929 --> 01:13:14,515
Yes, I think it'll be good
to put Hyun-gyu's like that.

1417
01:13:14,598 --> 01:13:17,643
Yoon So-hui gets six green points.

1418
01:13:17,726 --> 01:13:18,894
It is now Son Eun-yu's turn.

1419
01:13:18,977 --> 01:13:20,312
Eun-yu.

1420
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:22,356
There are too many
on that green one right now.

1421
01:13:22,439 --> 01:13:23,482
Shall I move that one?

1422
01:13:23,565 --> 01:13:26,402
Yes, because we can't let
anyone get a lot of points in one go.

1423
01:13:26,485 --> 01:13:28,362
-We need to split it up.
-Yes.

1424
01:13:28,445 --> 01:13:29,822
Really? Then…

1425
01:13:31,115 --> 01:13:33,325
Gosh, what a hassle just to get these two.

1426
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:36,120
Gosh, it's so hard. Such tough opponents.

1427
01:13:36,203 --> 01:13:38,414
-Son Eun-yu gets one blue point.
-Okay.

1428
01:13:38,497 --> 01:13:40,290
Kyuhyun, please move the counters.

1429
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:43,001
-They're clearing everything.
-What?

1430
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:45,796
They're clearing all the spaces
in front of us.

1431
01:13:45,879 --> 01:13:48,632
Then we can just take our time.

1432
01:13:48,715 --> 01:13:49,633
Okay.

1433
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:54,638
-What?
-Nothing.

1434
01:13:54,721 --> 01:13:56,473
Make sure you take care of yourself.

1435
01:13:56,557 --> 01:13:58,725
You'll try and end it
as soon as possible, right?

1436
01:13:58,809 --> 01:14:00,185
-Of course.
-Right.

1437
01:14:00,936 --> 01:14:02,438
Will you give me some points?

1438
01:14:02,521 --> 01:14:04,565
-What?
-Will you give me some points?

1439
01:14:04,648 --> 01:14:05,649
What will you go for?

1440
01:14:05,732 --> 01:14:08,235
Well, I can't right now.
You've cleared everything away.

1441
01:14:08,318 --> 01:14:10,863
All your counters are clustered together.
Try to spread them out.

1442
01:14:10,946 --> 01:14:12,239
They're too easy to clear out.

1443
01:14:12,739 --> 01:14:14,992
-I'm going.
-Yes, that's right. Okay. That's right.

1444
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:17,411
Okay. I think that's the right move.

1445
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:20,664
Kyuhyun gets two green points.

1446
01:14:25,002 --> 01:14:28,380
Choi Hyun-joon gets one blue point.

1447
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:30,966
Kang Ji-yeong, please move the counters.

1448
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:36,138
Kang Ji-yeong gets two blue points.

1449
01:14:36,221 --> 01:14:37,723
That concludes Round 2.

1450
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:43,687
You and So-hui concentrate
on getting yourself points.

1451
01:14:43,770 --> 01:14:46,899
Because I think the three of us
might end up in a situation

1452
01:14:46,982 --> 01:14:49,026
where we have to blow things up
even before reaching 15.

1453
01:14:49,109 --> 01:14:50,777
That would be the worst.

1454
01:14:50,861 --> 01:14:53,447
We need to hit and kill him.
We don't have any choice.

1455
01:14:53,530 --> 01:14:56,700
So, when that happens,
since you have a lot of Pieces,

1456
01:14:56,783 --> 01:14:58,368
-you two need to make a run for it.
-Okay.

1457
01:14:58,452 --> 01:15:01,788
Just trust me and focus on going for it.
We'll do the rest of the blocking.

1458
01:15:01,872 --> 01:15:03,373
Round 3 will now begin.

1459
01:15:04,249 --> 01:15:06,418
Jeong Hyun-gyu, please move the counters.

1460
01:15:18,555 --> 01:15:20,641
Hyun-gyu is trying
to avoid getting points.

1461
01:15:22,935 --> 01:15:26,188
7high gets one green point.

1462
01:15:26,271 --> 01:15:28,565
7high, please move the counters.

1463
01:15:30,317 --> 01:15:33,820
7high gets seven red points.

1464
01:15:33,904 --> 01:15:36,323
It is now Yoon So-hui's turn.
Please move the counters.

1465
01:15:36,406 --> 01:15:39,451
Kyuhyun gets seven red points.

1466
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:40,661
It is now Son Eun-yu's turn.

1467
01:15:40,744 --> 01:15:42,996
-Can I just take this one here?
-Yes.

1468
01:15:44,706 --> 01:15:47,876
Son Eun-yu gets five red points.

1469
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:49,711
It is now Kyuhyun's turn.

1470
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:51,838
-I need to go there. Yes.
-Yes. It's better to empty that one.

1471
01:15:51,922 --> 01:15:53,340
I'll do it.

1472
01:15:53,423 --> 01:15:57,177
Put one here.

1473
01:15:57,261 --> 01:15:58,595
This is better, right?

1474
01:15:58,679 --> 01:15:59,846
Having them together.

1475
01:16:00,889 --> 01:16:02,266
There's not much I can do.

1476
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:04,351
Let's see.

1477
01:16:07,604 --> 01:16:10,566
Yoon So-hui gets red one point.

1478
01:16:10,649 --> 01:16:13,193
Let's keep getting each other
points for now, okay?

1479
01:16:13,277 --> 01:16:15,529
Choi Hyun-joon, please move the counters.

1480
01:16:19,408 --> 01:16:22,494
Choi Hyun-joon, which color points
would you like for yourself?

1481
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:24,496
I will choose green.

1482
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:27,874
Choi Hyun-joon gets four green points.

1483
01:16:27,958 --> 01:16:29,751
We had no choice.
We should've split it up.

1484
01:16:29,835 --> 01:16:30,877
It's fine.

1485
01:16:30,961 --> 01:16:32,629
It is now Kang Ji-yeong's turn.

1486
01:16:32,713 --> 01:16:35,424
Let's look at that side first.

1487
01:16:35,924 --> 01:16:37,634
One, two, three, four.

1488
01:16:39,052 --> 01:16:39,928
Three points.

1489
01:16:40,012 --> 01:16:41,847
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

1490
01:16:42,681 --> 01:16:44,766
Both get three points.

1491
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:47,102
-Hyun-gyu will take three points.
-Isn't that okay?

1492
01:16:47,185 --> 01:16:49,855
Hold on. One, two, three, four.

1493
01:16:50,647 --> 01:16:52,316
He probably won't want red.

1494
01:16:52,399 --> 01:16:54,192
-How are you going to distribute them?
-Over there.

1495
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:56,194
-You want to get the green?
-Yes, and then…

1496
01:16:56,278 --> 01:16:58,488
And what are you going to do
with the rest?

1497
01:17:00,824 --> 01:17:02,117
There are too many of them.

1498
01:17:03,410 --> 01:17:05,662
What do you mean?
There were more of you yesterday.

1499
01:17:05,746 --> 01:17:07,623
I mean, this isn't
a great game for alliances.

1500
01:17:09,124 --> 01:17:11,460
How will you all manage
to share the points evenly?

1501
01:17:14,254 --> 01:17:15,422
-I don't know either.
-Exactly.

1502
01:17:21,345 --> 01:17:24,514
Or how about spreading these two out?

1503
01:17:24,598 --> 01:17:26,933
-These?
-Yes, like this. One each.

1504
01:17:27,434 --> 01:17:29,936
-And give them three points?
-We have to give three points anyway.

1505
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:31,355
One, two, three, four.

1506
01:17:31,438 --> 01:17:33,815
But rather than spreading these out…

1507
01:17:33,899 --> 01:17:34,900
Split that up?

1508
01:17:40,530 --> 01:17:44,117
Kang Ji-yeong gets one blue point.

1509
01:17:44,201 --> 01:17:45,702
That concludes Round 3.

1510
01:17:48,789 --> 01:17:50,415
Round 4 will now begin.

1511
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:51,458
Jeong Hyun-gyu.

1512
01:17:52,626 --> 01:17:55,045
I'm just surprised by Hyun-gyu's attitude.

1513
01:17:55,128 --> 01:17:58,507
The nonchalance of saying,
"I can do it by myself."

1514
01:17:58,590 --> 01:18:01,134
So I was curious
about how he was going to play.

1515
01:18:01,218 --> 01:18:04,680
You never know. He's definitely
capable of springing a surprise.

1516
01:18:04,763 --> 01:18:06,348
Which, to be frank, is even scarier.

1517
01:18:13,939 --> 01:18:16,650
Choi Hyun-joon gets two red points.

1518
01:18:16,733 --> 01:18:17,567
Thank you.

1519
01:18:17,651 --> 01:18:18,944
It is now 7high's turn.

1520
01:18:21,655 --> 01:18:24,366
7high gets two blue points.

1521
01:18:24,449 --> 01:18:25,992
It is now Yoon So-hui's turn.

1522
01:18:26,076 --> 01:18:28,120
Oaky. That's not bad.

1523
01:18:28,203 --> 01:18:30,997
7high gets three green points.

1524
01:18:32,290 --> 01:18:35,377
Son Eun-yu gets four green points.

1525
01:18:38,296 --> 01:18:40,966
Kyuhyun gets two blue points.

1526
01:18:41,049 --> 01:18:42,384
It is now Choi Hyun-joon's turn.

1527
01:18:42,467 --> 01:18:44,469
Come here. Spread that one.

1528
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:47,764
If you do that, these two will go to red.

1529
01:18:47,848 --> 01:18:49,307
So spread that one out. That's best.

1530
01:18:49,391 --> 01:18:51,935
-But if I get more blue…
-You don't need to get it.

1531
01:18:52,018 --> 01:18:53,854
But I need to get points.

1532
01:18:53,937 --> 01:18:55,647
Come on, it's still early.

1533
01:18:55,731 --> 01:18:59,651
Also, they have too few blue points.
Look at the blue.

1534
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:02,362
Two people can go from green to blue.

1535
01:19:02,446 --> 01:19:04,614
But I'm going to go to green
so they won't go for blue.

1536
01:19:04,698 --> 01:19:06,742
Still, I don't really
want to get more blue.

1537
01:19:06,825 --> 01:19:08,952
-Right. Just leave him be.
-I also have my own thoughts.

1538
01:19:09,035 --> 01:19:12,581
-Yeah, KAIST.
-Hyun-joon went to KAIST as well.

1539
01:19:12,664 --> 01:19:15,417
But Hyun-joon is a bit timid,

1540
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:16,877
not capable of making bold moves.

1541
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:18,837
Hyun-joon.

1542
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:21,548
If you get too many of one color
at the start, you'll be a target.

1543
01:19:21,631 --> 01:19:23,467
It's going to be one of you two.

1544
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:26,052
Hyun-gyu knows that.
That's why he wants you to get more.

1545
01:19:26,136 --> 01:19:28,263
So play it safe and just get one green.

1546
01:19:28,346 --> 01:19:31,641
If you get one green,
you'll be less of a target to the others.

1547
01:19:31,725 --> 01:19:33,226
-Okay.
-So try to maintain a balance.

1548
01:19:37,731 --> 01:19:39,691
Since I was here, I'll put these back.

1549
01:19:40,817 --> 01:19:42,277
What are you going to do?

1550
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:43,278
To get a green.

1551
01:19:44,070 --> 01:19:45,322
Are you scared?

1552
01:19:45,405 --> 01:19:46,531
I want to get a green first.

1553
01:19:47,407 --> 01:19:48,366
Well, if you're scared…

1554
01:19:51,077 --> 01:19:54,664
Choi Hyun-joon gets one green point.

1555
01:19:54,748 --> 01:19:56,333
It is now Kang Ji-yeong's turn.

1556
01:19:56,917 --> 01:19:57,751
Is it me?

1557
01:19:59,586 --> 01:20:02,172
Then Ji-yeong can get the green.
Why did you do that?

1558
01:20:02,964 --> 01:20:06,718
Well, it didn't feel right
to just keep getting blue ones.

1559
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:07,636
Are you scared?

1560
01:20:07,719 --> 01:20:09,262
Still. They have the majority.

1561
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:13,141
In fact, what I felt
when Hyun-gyu objected was

1562
01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:15,519
that he tends to try to control the game.

1563
01:20:15,602 --> 01:20:18,980
He's the kind of person that
tries to sway the free will of others.

1564
01:20:22,943 --> 01:20:25,403
Kang Ji-yeong gets five green points.

1565
01:20:25,487 --> 01:20:27,113
That concludes Round 4.

1566
01:20:27,614 --> 01:20:28,782
This is tough.

1567
01:20:30,826 --> 01:20:32,577
So we're waiting for our chance.

1568
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:36,665
For example, Hyun-gyu makes
a mistake and gets several red ones.

1569
01:20:36,748 --> 01:20:39,960
The moment he does,
we swoop in and keep giving him reds.

1570
01:20:40,043 --> 01:20:41,878
So we can get rid of him once and for all.

1571
01:20:42,796 --> 01:20:44,631
Round 5 will now begin.

1572
01:20:44,714 --> 01:20:46,967
Jeong Hyun-gyu, please move the counters.

1573
01:20:50,929 --> 01:20:54,432
Jeong Hyun-gyu gets one red point.

1574
01:20:54,516 --> 01:20:55,767
It is now 7high's turn.

1575
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:57,519
We don't have many blue points, right?

1576
01:20:57,602 --> 01:20:58,645
That's right.

1577
01:21:02,899 --> 01:21:04,818
No, So-hui needs to get this.

1578
01:21:04,901 --> 01:21:06,486
-She can go for it.
-So-hui needs these.

1579
01:21:06,570 --> 01:21:07,904
Wait, see here.

1580
01:21:07,988 --> 01:21:09,865
If I get this and put this here,

1581
01:21:09,948 --> 01:21:13,201
we can move two like this,
and she can get six.

1582
01:21:13,285 --> 01:21:15,036
-Right.
-So we can both get points, right?

1583
01:21:17,289 --> 01:21:20,500
7high gets five blue points.

1584
01:21:20,584 --> 01:21:21,918
Yoon So-hui, it's your turn.

1585
01:21:23,086 --> 01:21:26,131
Yoon So-hui gets six blue points.

1586
01:21:26,214 --> 01:21:27,841
Six points? That's not bad.

1587
01:21:28,341 --> 01:21:29,593
It is now Son Eun-yu's turn.

1588
01:21:29,676 --> 01:21:31,386
I will take green.

1589
01:21:31,469 --> 01:21:34,472
-So Eun-yu gets one green point.
-Okay.

1590
01:21:34,556 --> 01:21:35,891
It is now Kyuhyun's turn.

1591
01:21:35,974 --> 01:21:37,893
What I'm thinking is,

1592
01:21:37,976 --> 01:21:39,895
because I'm close with Hyun-gyu…

1593
01:21:41,396 --> 01:21:43,315
Because Hyun-gyu is handsome…

1594
01:21:46,276 --> 01:21:47,861
Why not say anything about 7high?

1595
01:21:47,944 --> 01:21:49,529
He's… he's cool.

1596
01:21:50,030 --> 01:21:51,573
You're stuttering an awful lot.

1597
01:21:52,198 --> 01:21:54,075
-How's that?
-I think it's okay.

1598
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:58,246
Kyuhyun gets two blue points.

1599
01:21:58,330 --> 01:21:59,164
Okay.

1600
01:21:59,247 --> 01:22:00,498
It is now Choi Hyun-joon's turn.

1601
01:22:00,582 --> 01:22:02,834
-Do whatever you want.
-Okay.

1602
01:22:04,169 --> 01:22:05,670
I'll land on red.

1603
01:22:07,047 --> 01:22:09,799
Choi Hyun-joon gets three red points.

1604
01:22:09,883 --> 01:22:11,384
Three points is better than nothing.

1605
01:22:11,468 --> 01:22:12,928
It is now Kang Ji-yeong's turn.

1606
01:22:15,388 --> 01:22:16,640
God, it's over.

1607
01:22:16,723 --> 01:22:19,559
Kang Ji-yeong gets two blue points.

1608
01:22:19,643 --> 01:22:21,728
That concludes Round 5.

1609
01:22:22,979 --> 01:22:24,689
That was Round 5. Now the prize mission…

1610
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:27,150
Here is today's prize mission.

1611
01:22:27,233 --> 01:22:31,488
This will be the last prize mission
in The Devil's Plan.

1612
01:22:31,988 --> 01:22:33,031
This is the last one?

1613
01:22:33,114 --> 01:22:36,451
Send another player's counter
to the devil space

1614
01:22:36,534 --> 01:22:40,830
and increase the score of their highest
color by five points or more at once.

1615
01:22:40,914 --> 01:22:43,959
If you complete this mission five times,

1616
01:22:44,042 --> 01:22:48,046
100 million won will be
added to the prize money.

1617
01:22:48,129 --> 01:22:50,966
-Is that possible?
-It's not bad if we do it early on.

1618
01:22:51,049 --> 01:22:52,968
-I think it'll be okay.
-We have to do it now.

1619
01:22:53,051 --> 01:22:56,513
Round 6 will now begin.

1620
01:22:56,596 --> 01:22:59,307
-It won't be too bad if we do it early on.
-Right, because…

1621
01:22:59,391 --> 01:23:01,101
If someone goes in there,
it's five points.

1622
01:23:01,184 --> 01:23:02,936
-Yes, it is.
-Right. Good.

1623
01:23:03,019 --> 01:23:05,313
Jeong Hyun-gyu, please move the counters.

1624
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:14,990
Jeong Hyun-gyu gets two blue points.

1625
01:23:15,073 --> 01:23:16,324
It is now 7high's turn.

1626
01:23:18,952 --> 01:23:19,786
7high,

1627
01:23:19,869 --> 01:23:21,830
which color would you like your points on?

1628
01:23:21,913 --> 01:23:23,039
Red, please.

1629
01:23:23,123 --> 01:23:26,001
7high gets three red points.

1630
01:23:28,253 --> 01:23:31,715
Yoon So-hui gets four red points.

1631
01:23:31,798 --> 01:23:33,425
It is now Son Eun-yu's turn.

1632
01:23:33,508 --> 01:23:35,176
Kyuhyun, you and I can do this.

1633
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:37,721
I'll play this one.
Then I can place them like this.

1634
01:23:37,804 --> 01:23:40,974
Then you play this here
and put my counter in here

1635
01:23:41,057 --> 01:23:42,308
to complete the mission once.

1636
01:23:45,979 --> 01:23:49,858
7high gets one green point.
It is now Kyuhyun's turn.

1637
01:23:49,941 --> 01:23:53,403
I'm not sure about the others,
but you can send me to the devil space.

1638
01:23:53,486 --> 01:23:55,280
You go here and send me there.

1639
01:23:55,947 --> 01:23:59,909
Kyuhyun, which color points
would you like for Son Eun-yu?

1640
01:23:59,993 --> 01:24:01,036
Do green.

1641
01:24:01,119 --> 01:24:02,370
I will choose green.

1642
01:24:02,454 --> 01:24:05,790
Son Eun-yu gets five green points.

1643
01:24:06,374 --> 01:24:08,835
The mission has been
accomplished for the first time.

1644
01:24:10,003 --> 01:24:11,254
First tick in the box.

1645
01:24:11,921 --> 01:24:13,256
It is now Choi Hyun-joon's turn.

1646
01:24:13,798 --> 01:24:16,468
-Well, I will…
-It would be better for you to clear this.

1647
01:24:16,551 --> 01:24:19,262
But if I clear it,
can they just fill it up again?

1648
01:24:19,345 --> 01:24:21,556
But even if you move this,
you only get one blue point.

1649
01:24:21,639 --> 01:24:23,933
That's not a good move for you to make.

1650
01:24:24,017 --> 01:24:26,394
-Don't do it.
-Don't you want to do the prize mission?

1651
01:24:26,478 --> 01:24:28,646
-Yes, let's finish the mission ASAP.
-The prize mission?

1652
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:32,067
Because we have to collect them again.
I mean, they'll be gone in one go.

1653
01:24:32,650 --> 01:24:33,943
Do whatever you want.

1654
01:24:40,033 --> 01:24:42,994
Choi Hyun-joon,
which color points would you like?

1655
01:24:43,078 --> 01:24:44,370
Five points on green.

1656
01:24:44,454 --> 01:24:46,623
Choi Hyun-joon gets five green points.

1657
01:24:46,706 --> 01:24:47,582
Thank you.

1658
01:24:47,665 --> 01:24:48,875
It is now Kang Ji-yeong's turn.

1659
01:24:49,459 --> 01:24:52,170
Maybe we should just leave the angel.
They can't get them anyway.

1660
01:24:52,253 --> 01:24:53,713
So leave it so we can get points?

1661
01:24:53,797 --> 01:24:55,840
We need to increase our points quickly.

1662
01:24:55,924 --> 01:24:57,550
Let's not clear the angel space.

1663
01:24:57,634 --> 01:24:59,469
Oh, then let's do that.

1664
01:24:59,552 --> 01:25:02,097
Let's just leave both ends.

1665
01:25:02,180 --> 01:25:05,600
We can just control it
to make sure they can't even touch it.

1666
01:25:05,683 --> 01:25:08,895
Then they can't get that pile,
and we can make the gap bigger.

1667
01:25:08,978 --> 01:25:11,940
Ji-yeong, you're okay to get green
or get one point on blue.

1668
01:25:12,023 --> 01:25:13,817
I think it's okay either way for you.

1669
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:20,698
Kang Ji-yeong gets three green points.

1670
01:25:20,782 --> 01:25:22,367
That concludes Round 6.

1671
01:25:22,450 --> 01:25:24,285
Round 7 will now begin.

1672
01:25:24,369 --> 01:25:25,703
It is now Jeong Hyun-gyu's turn.

1673
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:33,795
Jeong Hyun-gyu gets four green points.

1674
01:25:33,878 --> 01:25:35,505
It is now 7high's turn.

1675
01:25:37,549 --> 01:25:40,260
7high gets one green point.

1676
01:25:40,343 --> 01:25:41,761
It is now Yoon So-hui's turn.

1677
01:25:41,845 --> 01:25:44,389
Let's think of a way
to get So-hui some points.

1678
01:25:44,472 --> 01:25:48,101
I'm thinking of playing this one
to put Kyuhyun here.

1679
01:25:48,184 --> 01:25:49,018
Kyuhyun here?

1680
01:25:49,102 --> 01:25:52,188
Yes, because he doesn't have
many green points.

1681
01:25:52,272 --> 01:25:54,399
-Eun-yu, I think you should do it.
-Oh, really?

1682
01:25:54,482 --> 01:25:55,733
You go get that.

1683
01:25:55,817 --> 01:25:57,443
And you get this. You need points.

1684
01:25:57,527 --> 01:25:59,988
Eun-yu can move Kyuhyun here.

1685
01:26:00,071 --> 01:26:01,865
How many is that? Seven, right?

1686
01:26:01,948 --> 01:26:03,283
It's 15 points anyway.

1687
01:26:03,366 --> 01:26:05,535
-To get that, you need all of that.
-Okay, I will.

1688
01:26:05,618 --> 01:26:07,996
-You can't do it by balancing. Get these.
-Okay then.

1689
01:26:08,079 --> 01:26:09,873
I'll just play this one then.

1690
01:26:10,623 --> 01:26:13,751
Yoon So-hui gets seven red points.

1691
01:26:13,835 --> 01:26:15,253
It is now Son Eun-yu's turn.

1692
01:26:15,336 --> 01:26:17,213
Gosh, that's a lot. One.

1693
01:26:18,631 --> 01:26:21,092
Son Eun-yu gets three red points.

1694
01:26:21,176 --> 01:26:22,427
It is now Kyuhyun's turn.

1695
01:26:23,094 --> 01:26:24,888
-Good job. Well done. Nice.
-Good.

1696
01:26:24,971 --> 01:26:27,390
Kyuhyun gets eight green points.

1697
01:26:27,473 --> 01:26:28,808
It is now Choi Hyun-joon's turn.

1698
01:26:28,892 --> 01:26:29,893
Let's see.

1699
01:26:31,436 --> 01:26:32,604
You need to break this one.

1700
01:26:32,687 --> 01:26:34,606
If he breaks it, Hyun-joon will go to red.

1701
01:26:34,689 --> 01:26:36,691
Or you can take this one.

1702
01:26:36,774 --> 01:26:39,736
Or shall I take another six points?
On green?

1703
01:26:39,819 --> 01:26:43,031
Because of the prize mission,
isn't it better to get them now?

1704
01:26:43,114 --> 01:26:43,948
Give her the points.

1705
01:26:44,032 --> 01:26:46,117
Let's get the prize mission. Is that okay?

1706
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:47,994
-Give it to her.
-Yes.

1707
01:26:48,077 --> 01:26:49,537
I'll put it here.

1708
01:26:49,621 --> 01:26:51,915
Son Eun-yu gets six green points.

1709
01:26:51,998 --> 01:26:53,166
Thank you.

1710
01:26:53,249 --> 01:26:55,877
The mission has been
accomplished for the second time.

1711
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:58,463
-I'm taking a hit for the prize.
-It is now Kang Ji-yeong's turn.

1712
01:26:58,546 --> 01:26:59,422
I'll put it here.

1713
01:27:00,924 --> 01:27:04,052
Kang Ji-yeong gets five red points.

1714
01:27:04,135 --> 01:27:06,095
That concludes Round 7.

1715
01:27:06,179 --> 01:27:07,805
Round 8 will now begin.

1716
01:27:07,889 --> 01:27:09,098
It is now Jeong Hyun-gyu's turn.

1717
01:27:14,562 --> 01:27:16,314
-He's going to clear it.
-Yes.

1718
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:21,819
He knows
it's really disadvantageous to him.

1719
01:27:23,696 --> 01:27:26,282
Jeong Hyun-gyu gets one blue point.

1720
01:27:26,366 --> 01:27:27,575
It is now 7high's turn.

1721
01:27:27,659 --> 01:27:29,744
Let's see then. Hang on.

1722
01:27:29,827 --> 01:27:31,496
What's up with the devil space?

1723
01:27:31,579 --> 01:27:32,956
He won't go in of his own accord.

1724
01:27:33,039 --> 01:27:35,250
-It's too high.
-It really is.

1725
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:37,710
Hyun-joon and I are safe.

1726
01:27:37,794 --> 01:27:40,922
You can't move that one
because this one will just get bigger.

1727
01:27:41,005 --> 01:27:42,632
Then Ji-yeong will die.

1728
01:27:42,715 --> 01:27:43,883
Think carefully.

1729
01:27:43,967 --> 01:27:45,426
You need to release this one.

1730
01:27:45,510 --> 01:27:47,804
No way. Why would we?

1731
01:27:47,887 --> 01:27:50,139
We have to increase points on that,
no matter what.

1732
01:27:53,476 --> 01:27:54,978
What are we going to do?

1733
01:27:55,061 --> 01:27:58,356
I'm contemplating where to go
and who I should give points to.

1734
01:27:58,439 --> 01:28:00,275
I think we should give
as many points as possible.

1735
01:28:00,358 --> 01:28:02,235
Kyuhyun can go for that.

1736
01:28:02,318 --> 01:28:03,528
Get that?

1737
01:28:03,611 --> 01:28:05,947
How many is it? It's six.
Isn't it going there?

1738
01:28:06,030 --> 01:28:08,032
Definitely.
One person has to take the points.

1739
01:28:08,116 --> 01:28:10,201
Exactly. If you release that one,
we get four here.

1740
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:13,621
Then after that,
So-hui can hit me with the devil points.

1741
01:28:13,705 --> 01:28:15,498
-Then there will be three here.
-Right.

1742
01:28:15,581 --> 01:28:19,085
Then we can do this and get one more.
Then we can clear the devil space.

1743
01:28:19,168 --> 01:28:20,128
Good, good.

1744
01:28:20,211 --> 01:28:22,130
Is there anyone we can use to clear it?

1745
01:28:22,213 --> 01:28:23,715
Hyun-joon can do it.

1746
01:28:23,798 --> 01:28:26,426
Yes, Hyun-joon will clear it
because he won't go to the devil.

1747
01:28:26,509 --> 01:28:28,219
So, Hyun-joon will clear it. Let's do it.

1748
01:28:28,303 --> 01:28:30,638
-Look at mine. It's frustrating.
-Okay. I'm doing it.

1749
01:28:30,722 --> 01:28:32,473
Ji-yeong, were all four of yours there?

1750
01:28:33,433 --> 01:28:34,642
I'll put Kyuhyun here.

1751
01:28:37,103 --> 01:28:38,563
Kyuhyun, why are you taking it?

1752
01:28:39,897 --> 01:28:41,065
Are you going to take that?

1753
01:28:41,733 --> 01:28:43,359
-What?
-Are you going to take that?

1754
01:28:43,443 --> 01:28:45,361
Because it has to be
someone else's counter.

1755
01:28:45,445 --> 01:28:46,988
One color does get really high.

1756
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:53,202
Kyuhyun gets eight green points.

1757
01:28:54,329 --> 01:28:57,248
The mission has been
accomplished for the third time.

1758
01:28:57,332 --> 01:28:58,416
Will it be even possible?

1759
01:28:58,499 --> 01:28:59,709
-Two more times?
-Yes.

1760
01:28:59,792 --> 01:29:02,086
If we break this,
we have to amass them again.

1761
01:29:02,170 --> 01:29:04,297
-That'll take time.
-I think we need to clear this.

1762
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:06,591
I think it should be cleared…

1763
01:29:06,674 --> 01:29:08,843
There are way too many on that space.

1764
01:29:08,926 --> 01:29:10,720
We plan on clearing it afterward.

1765
01:29:13,973 --> 01:29:16,392
It feels scary putting it here,
for some reason.

1766
01:29:16,476 --> 01:29:19,520
7high gets nine green points.

1767
01:29:19,604 --> 01:29:22,357
The mission has been
accomplished for the fourth time.

1768
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:23,483
It is now Son Eun-yu's turn.

1769
01:29:23,566 --> 01:29:26,444
Since So-hui has so many,
I'll put Ji-yeong's in.

1770
01:29:29,238 --> 01:29:32,325
Kang Ji-yeong gets ten red points.

1771
01:29:32,408 --> 01:29:35,203
The mission has been
accomplished for the fifth time.

1772
01:29:35,286 --> 01:29:37,372
You have successfully
completed the prize mission.

1773
01:29:37,455 --> 01:29:38,790
That's amazing.

1774
01:29:39,457 --> 01:29:42,627
100 million won has been added
to the accumulated prize money,

1775
01:29:42,710 --> 01:29:44,420
which now stands at 380 million won.

1776
01:29:44,504 --> 01:29:46,464
Whoever wins The Devil's Plan…

1777
01:29:46,547 --> 01:29:47,382
Congratulations.

1778
01:29:47,465 --> 01:29:51,886
Those guys practically committed mass
suicide just to get that prize money up.

1779
01:29:51,969 --> 01:29:53,554
How many Pieces do you have?

1780
01:29:53,638 --> 01:29:54,806
Thirteen.

1781
01:29:54,889 --> 01:29:56,808
-Why do you ask?
-Let's end this.

1782
01:29:57,850 --> 01:30:01,312
I'm planning to end the game by destroying

1783
01:30:01,396 --> 01:30:03,231
Ji-yeong and 7high.

1784
01:30:03,314 --> 01:30:05,441
They successfully
completed the prize mission,

1785
01:30:05,525 --> 01:30:08,152
but the scores of the alliance
have gotten quite close

1786
01:30:08,236 --> 01:30:10,154
to the limit of 30 that ends the game.

1787
01:30:10,238 --> 01:30:13,866
Now this is when the real game
of Balance Mancala starts.

1788
01:30:13,950 --> 01:30:15,034
It is now Kyuhyun's turn.

1789
01:30:15,118 --> 01:30:16,661
Kyuhyun, let's clear this.

1790
01:30:16,744 --> 01:30:19,288
-Hyun-joon might not do it. You do it.
-Me? Okay, I'll do it.

1791
01:30:19,372 --> 01:30:20,957
We're finally breaking it. Damn.

1792
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:22,166
That feels much better.

1793
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:23,584
There are way too many in here.

1794
01:30:23,668 --> 01:30:25,420
But how will you distribute them?

1795
01:30:25,503 --> 01:30:29,465
-Everything rests in your hands.
-I know, there are too many in here.

1796
01:30:29,549 --> 01:30:33,511
First, let me see where mine will go.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

1797
01:30:33,594 --> 01:30:34,512
Why is it so far?

1798
01:30:34,595 --> 01:30:36,639
That's green. I don't want to go to green.

1799
01:30:36,722 --> 01:30:38,975
-Who wants to go to green?
-Me.

1800
01:30:39,058 --> 01:30:40,393
You can give it to So-hui.

1801
01:30:40,476 --> 01:30:42,145
I'm doing it. There's no problem, right?

1802
01:30:42,228 --> 01:30:43,229
-No.
-No.

1803
01:30:46,274 --> 01:30:49,026
Yoon So-hui gets one green point.

1804
01:30:49,110 --> 01:30:50,361
It is now Choi Hyun-joon's turn.

1805
01:30:50,445 --> 01:30:53,197
I was planning to get red on this turn.

1806
01:30:53,281 --> 01:30:54,866
So I think I should move this one.

1807
01:30:54,949 --> 01:30:57,410
-Yes, move it. I think that's right.
-Yes, I think that'll be better.

1808
01:30:58,077 --> 01:31:01,038
Choi Hyun-joon gets two red points.

1809
01:31:01,122 --> 01:31:02,457
It is now Kang Ji-yeong's turn.

1810
01:31:02,540 --> 01:31:04,041
Then I will go with this one.

1811
01:31:05,877 --> 01:31:08,588
Kang Ji-yeong gets two green points.

1812
01:31:08,671 --> 01:31:10,131
That concludes Round 8.

1813
01:31:10,214 --> 01:31:11,716
Round 9 will now begin.

1814
01:31:12,467 --> 01:31:14,594
So, I'm going to blow things up.

1815
01:31:14,677 --> 01:31:17,930
Now let's see. You have 14,
how many Pieces? Thirteen?

1816
01:31:18,014 --> 01:31:20,349
-So that would leave you with seven?
-Yes.

1817
01:31:20,433 --> 01:31:23,311
That would leave you in first,
So-hui in second,

1818
01:31:23,394 --> 01:31:25,354
and everyone else under five.

1819
01:31:25,438 --> 01:31:28,065
If we give the others points
and end the game,

1820
01:31:28,149 --> 01:31:29,984
-that will effectively mean we win.
-I know.

1821
01:31:30,067 --> 01:31:31,861
As long as none of them finishes first.

1822
01:31:31,944 --> 01:31:33,988
-All right.
-But you need to calculate their points.

1823
01:31:34,071 --> 01:31:35,823
See if any of them
are able to finish first.

1824
01:31:35,907 --> 01:31:36,741
Nobody.

1825
01:31:36,824 --> 01:31:38,242
First will be either you or me.

1826
01:31:38,826 --> 01:31:40,411
Hyun-joon will do it for sure.

1827
01:31:40,495 --> 01:31:42,121
It's to his own benefit.

1828
01:31:42,205 --> 01:31:44,624
Jeong Hyun-gyu, please move the counters.

1829
01:31:50,922 --> 01:31:53,257
Kyuhyun gets two green points.

1830
01:31:53,341 --> 01:31:54,550
It is now 7high's turn.

1831
01:31:55,051 --> 01:31:57,553
Aren't there too many gathered there?

1832
01:31:57,637 --> 01:32:00,014
-I'd like to clear it.
-Two, four, six, eight, nine.

1833
01:32:00,097 --> 01:32:02,642
I'm uneasy about that.
Green is too dangerous for us.

1834
01:32:04,352 --> 01:32:07,813
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight. So it's nine?

1835
01:32:07,897 --> 01:32:08,814
It'll come to here.

1836
01:32:08,898 --> 01:32:10,358
That will work. Okay.

1837
01:32:13,402 --> 01:32:15,988
7high gets three red points.

1838
01:32:16,072 --> 01:32:19,200
Yoon So-hui gets four green points.

1839
01:32:19,283 --> 01:32:20,409
It is now Son Eun-yu's turn.

1840
01:32:20,493 --> 01:32:22,495
She gets four red points.

1841
01:32:22,578 --> 01:32:23,704
It is now Kyuhyun's turn.

1842
01:32:23,788 --> 01:32:25,665
We need to be careful about that.

1843
01:32:25,748 --> 01:32:30,586
They might try and give you or 7high
10 points to end the game.

1844
01:32:30,670 --> 01:32:32,755
-They might try to send you to prison.
-You're right.

1845
01:32:32,838 --> 01:32:34,757
So be careful when you place his counter.

1846
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:36,467
Yes, I've been thinking about that.

1847
01:32:37,093 --> 01:32:39,971
Kyuhyun gets three blue points.

1848
01:32:40,054 --> 01:32:41,430
It is now Choi Hyun-joon's turn.

1849
01:32:42,181 --> 01:32:43,391
Let's see.

1850
01:32:52,149 --> 01:32:54,193
Give 7high some green points.

1851
01:33:07,290 --> 01:33:09,208
Listen to me. Please.

1852
01:33:12,336 --> 01:33:14,046
I was thinking of doing this one.

1853
01:33:14,130 --> 01:33:14,964
Why?

1854
01:33:15,965 --> 01:33:17,925
What are you trying
to achieve by doing that?

1855
01:33:18,009 --> 01:33:20,720
-I want to get some blue points.
-Why?

1856
01:33:20,803 --> 01:33:22,638
Doesn't Hyun-joon have to
get some blue points?

1857
01:33:22,722 --> 01:33:24,599
Right, his blue points are the lowest.

1858
01:33:24,682 --> 01:33:26,142
You want to get to 15 points?

1859
01:33:26,225 --> 01:33:27,059
For now.

1860
01:33:27,143 --> 01:33:29,520
If those guys make their move
and start getting points,

1861
01:33:29,604 --> 01:33:30,855
we're going to lose out.

1862
01:33:30,938 --> 01:33:33,524
-I'll give you all the Pieces.
-I'm not doing this for Pieces.

1863
01:33:33,608 --> 01:33:35,318
You are. You want to save your Pieces.

1864
01:33:35,401 --> 01:33:36,694
You don't have to give me any.

1865
01:33:36,777 --> 01:33:38,237
We're still in the clear.

1866
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:42,992
When we're holding a knife to their neck,
you can start earning points then.

1867
01:33:43,075 --> 01:33:44,827
I know what you're trying to say.

1868
01:33:49,165 --> 01:33:52,168
He was agonizing over it,
but I didn't understand why.

1869
01:33:53,336 --> 01:33:54,795
Do you know how to do arithmetic?

1870
01:33:54,879 --> 01:33:56,631
-Yes.
-Shall we do the math?

1871
01:33:56,714 --> 01:34:00,092
No, I get it. I know what you're saying.

1872
01:34:00,176 --> 01:34:02,970
Are you sure you used
the same decimal system?

1873
01:34:03,054 --> 01:34:03,888
Yes.

1874
01:34:03,971 --> 01:34:05,306
Which benefits you more?

1875
01:34:06,015 --> 01:34:08,351
Then is it because
you feel sorry for them?

1876
01:34:13,564 --> 01:34:16,025
Hyun-gyu needs to go today.

1877
01:34:17,151 --> 01:34:19,570
3 HOURS EARLIER

1878
01:34:19,654 --> 01:34:21,364
Let's get rid of someone later.

1879
01:34:21,864 --> 01:34:23,783
-Let's get rid of someone together.
-Exactly.

1880
01:34:23,866 --> 01:34:25,409
I talked to Hyun-joon,

1881
01:34:25,493 --> 01:34:27,578
and he suggested first
we should get rid of one of them.

1882
01:34:27,662 --> 01:34:28,871
Then what we can do for you

1883
01:34:28,954 --> 01:34:31,499
is take five Pieces from
whichever player you decide.

1884
01:34:31,582 --> 01:34:32,917
Then I choose him.

1885
01:34:33,417 --> 01:34:36,712
But see here. The problem is
that So-hui wants to kill him.

1886
01:34:36,796 --> 01:34:38,089
Not Hyun-gyu?

1887
01:34:38,172 --> 01:34:40,841
-But that's not the issue.
-We can just decide that.

1888
01:34:40,925 --> 01:34:43,302
Let's go with whatever So-hui decides.

1889
01:34:43,386 --> 01:34:46,097
Or we can discuss it again at the end.

1890
01:34:46,180 --> 01:34:47,556
-Let's turn our crosshairs.
-Right.

1891
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:49,767
-Then turn and go this way.
-This way.

1892
01:34:49,850 --> 01:34:53,396
So, we can't be in an open alliance
with Hyun-joon. That's the key point.

1893
01:34:53,479 --> 01:34:56,148
Well, I'm not sure about Kyuhyun.
Why has he gone in there?

1894
01:34:56,232 --> 01:34:57,566
Is he trying to screw me over?

1895
01:34:58,109 --> 01:35:01,862
We'll make it seem so at first,
then we'll send Hyun-gyu home today.

1896
01:35:01,946 --> 01:35:03,698
Have you guys all agreed on that?

1897
01:35:03,781 --> 01:35:05,282
Yeah, we talked. We all know.

1898
01:35:05,366 --> 01:35:06,367
-7high too?
-Yes.

1899
01:35:06,450 --> 01:35:07,785
Can I join you?

1900
01:35:07,868 --> 01:35:10,079
-Yes.
-Yeah. Of course.

1901
01:35:10,162 --> 01:35:11,414
Four, six.

1902
01:35:11,497 --> 01:35:13,374
We're talking about
how we should communicate.

1903
01:35:13,457 --> 01:35:16,460
Hyun-gyu is going to be the most
dangerous person to face in the final.

1904
01:35:16,544 --> 01:35:19,255
It's not just
that he's a really smart player,

1905
01:35:19,338 --> 01:35:21,132
but he has this unrevealed reward.

1906
01:35:21,215 --> 01:35:22,717
-Why do you ask?
-Let's end this.

1907
01:35:23,592 --> 01:35:25,344
Hyun-gyu keeps pushing me.

1908
01:35:25,428 --> 01:35:27,054
What's he pushing you to do?

1909
01:35:27,138 --> 01:35:29,014
To end it. Like he's Thanos.

1910
01:35:29,098 --> 01:35:32,309
7high, Hyun-gyu wants to
give you points to end the game.

1911
01:35:32,393 --> 01:35:34,895
I'm trying to drag things out,
but I can't last long.

1912
01:35:35,855 --> 01:35:37,648
We can even eliminate him right here.

1913
01:35:37,732 --> 01:35:40,025
There's no need for him to
have a go at the prison match.

1914
01:35:40,109 --> 01:35:45,197
So I discussed it
with Eun-yu, Ji-yeong, and 7high,

1915
01:35:45,281 --> 01:35:48,033
and agreed to eliminate Hyun-gyu
if possible.

1916
01:35:54,915 --> 01:35:56,125
You're so frustrating.

1917
01:35:57,793 --> 01:35:59,086
Just do what you want.

1918
01:36:01,172 --> 01:36:02,715
Yes, I'm done.

1919
01:36:02,798 --> 01:36:06,343
Choi Hyun-joon gets two blue points.

1920
01:36:06,427 --> 01:36:08,387
Eun-yu, my alliance is now over.

1921
01:36:09,138 --> 01:36:10,890
I'm going to show my true colors.

1922
01:37:39,395 --> 01:37:44,400
