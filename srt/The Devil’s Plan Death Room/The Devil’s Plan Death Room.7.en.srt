-Good luck.
-Let's make it fun.

3
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,847
Here are your personal cards.

4
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,727
They must be feeling so much pressure.

5
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,021
Wow, that kind of pressure.

6
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:22,605
Here are the first community cards.

7
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:23,898

Kim Ha-rin calls.

25
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:08,985
Justin Min.

26
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:14,199
-That's a big bet.
-Gosh, Justin.

27
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:18,703
Justin Min, you have called one
and raised four.

28
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:19,788
7high.

29
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:28,213
Call.

30
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:29,923

Oh, what about the seven…

35
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:46,272
-Two possible straights between 2 and 7.
-Yes, 7 Straight.

36
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:48,233
One.

37
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,735
Kim Ha-rin calls.

38
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:51,861
Justin Min.

39
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:55,949
Wow, he must be torn.

40
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:57,450
This is a big hand.

41
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:02,705
Okay, I'll call.

42
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:03,915
You have called.

43
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:05,542
The sniping will now begin.

44
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,544
7high, please make your snipe.

45
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,097
5 One Pair.

46
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,473
5 One Pair.

47
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,475
You have sniped 5 One Pair.

48
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,018
That's my choice.

49
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,270
5 One Pair?

50
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:27,105
-I can't read the mind of a master.
-Was it 7 and 5?

51
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,690
You have sniped 5 One Pair.

52
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,150
That's my choice.

53
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,484
Kim Ha-rin.

54
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,778
I will snipe 4 One Pair.

55
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,905
You have sniped 4 One Pair.

56
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,031
Justin Min.

57
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,286
7 One Pair.

58
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:42,996
What? I guess Justin's got nothing.

59
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,330
I think everyone's bluffing.

60
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:47,208
Seriously?
No one has a straight? Or a triple?

61
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:50,170
You have sniped 7 One Pair.

62
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:52,964
Justin Min, please reveal your cards.

63
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:55,925
9, 10. He was bluffing.

64
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,177
-He's bluffing.
-Bluffing on a ten.

65
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,803
Ten high card.

66
00:02:58,887 --> 00:02:59,888
Kim Ha-rin.

67
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:01,598

00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:02,724

00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:07,187
7high.

71
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:11,024
7 One Pair.

72
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:13,193
Justin Min wins this round.

73
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:16,905
-With a 10 High Card.
-Look. Both 7 and 5 One Pairs were sniped.

74
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:20,825
I will give you 21 chips.

75
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:25,455
What's amazing is, he went
for it with nothing but a ten high.

76
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:28,583
Yes. He got them fight
and came out top dog with a ten high.

77
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:29,667
With his sharp shooting.

78
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,380
Here are your personal cards.

79
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,716
-Kim Ha-rin, please place your bet.
-Fold.

80
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:37,926
You have folded.

81
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,510
Here are your personal cards.

82
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:40,929
Fold.

83
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,180
You have folded.

84
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:45,058
Ha-rin can't afford to
keep wasting chips like that.

85
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:48,019
Right now, Ha-rin is
stuck between two card sharks.

86
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:49,896
Here are the remaining community cards.

87
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,440
7high, please place your second bet.

88
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:54,984
One. Kim Ha-rin.

89
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,696
One. Justin Min.

90
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:02,158
You have called one and raised six.

91
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,076
Kim Ha-rin.

92
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,535
Fold.

93
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:05,662
You have folded.

94
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,914
What? Tonight, our queen…

95
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:12,085
It must be torture for her
because it's her third time.

96
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:14,254
She was so sure that she would be here,
but there she is.

97
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:17,257
-Because of that last Grim Reaper.
-That must be a big emotional hit.

98
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,300
I think the sense of loss would be big.

99
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:23,846
Here are your personal cards.

100
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,893
Here are the first two community cards.

101
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:34,148
Kim Ha-rin, please place your bet.

102
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:38,695
You have bet two.

103
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:41,990
You have folded.

104
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:44,951
Wait, so it's going
to be 7high against Ha-rin?

105
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:46,160
7high.

106
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:48,997
You have called.

107
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,999
Here are the remaining community cards.

108
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,336
Kim Ha-rin, please place your bet.

109
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:04,512
Two chips.

110
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:06,264
What? She's going to play?

111
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:07,849
7high, please place your bet.

112
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:11,811
Ten more.

113
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:15,648
You have called two and raised ten.

114
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,900
Ten? Why has he gone so hard?
What, ten more?

115
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:18,943
He's raised ten more?

116
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,029
-Wow, that's…
-He's coming on strong.

117
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:22,238
Kim Ha-rin.

118
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,747
What's up with Ha-rin?

119
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:33,833
I'll call.

120
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:34,751
You have called.

121
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,587
Ha-rin must be confident.

122
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,213
She's really going for it.

123
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,673
The sniping will now begin.

124
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,301
Kim Ha-rin, please make your snipe.

125
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,098
Ha-rin is getting tired.

126
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,975
-Is she sniping?
-Isn't she?

127
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,727
She looks different, right?

128
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,776
I will snipe 8 Two Pair.

129
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,903
I will snipe 8 Two Pair.

130
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:04,364
You have sniped 8 Two Pair.

131
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,366
7high, please make your snipe.

132
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:15,375
I will snipe 5 One Pair.

133
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,460
You have sniped 5 One Pair.

134
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,462
Kim Ha-rin, please reveal your cards.

135
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:23,925
I have 10 One Pair.

136
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:25,218
I have 10 One Pair.

137
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:26,302
10 One Pair.

138
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,179
I have 10 One Pair.

139
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,060
7high, 8 Two Pair.

140
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,355
-That's crazy.
-Amazing.

141
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,483
Kim Ha-rin, your snipe was successful.

142
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:41,943
Kim Ha-rin wins this round.

143
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:46,989
Wow, Ha-rin lives on.

144
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,033
I'm really learning how to play Poker,

145
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,077
thanks to such good teachers.

146
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,413
The moment I heard Ha-rin say

147
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:58,209
that she would snipe 8 Two Pair,

148
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:01,379
I panicked a bit because I realized

149
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:05,591
she was far better than I'd taken her for.

150
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:15,810
7high won't lose, would he?

151
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,690
Here are the first community cards.

152
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,608
7high, you have folded.

153
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,527
Here are the remaining community cards.

154
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,029
7high, you have folded.

155
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,906
Here are the first community cards.

156
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,075
7high, you have folded.

157
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,910
Kim Ha-rin, please reveal your cards.

158
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,287
1 One Pair.

159
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,455
7high

160
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,498
also has 1 One Pair.

161
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:40,376
After comparing your secondary cards,
Ha-rin wins this round.

162
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:44,005
Don't you get the feeling
that 7high is losing his pace?

163
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,718
Here are the first two community cards.

164
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,553
Kim Ha-rin, you have bet one.

165
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:51,929
Justin Min.

166
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,222
7high,

167
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,348
you have folded.

168
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,017
Here are the remaining community cards.

169
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,727
I will snipe 8 One Pair.

170
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,520
I will snipe 6 One Pair.

171
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,772
7high, please reveal your cards.

172
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:02,690
7 High.

173
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:03,983
-7 High.
-7 High?

174
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:05,234
Kim Ha-rin.

175
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,152
4 One Pair.

176
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,281
Kim Ha-rin wins this round.

177
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:12,909
When there were four or five of us,

178
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:16,120
although it was a bit
different from Texas Hold'em,

179
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:18,873
it didn't deviate much from the concept,

180
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:21,918
so I assumed
it was a game I couldn't lose.

181
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,253
But as the side rules started to kick in,

182
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,965
I realized that this game wasn't
what I thought it was.

183
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:31,677
-Personally, I hope that Ha-rin survives.
-Me too.

184
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,054
I hope 7high makes it.

185
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:35,306
It's absurd if he loses playing Hold'em.

186
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:38,017
I just realized
they've been standing there for two hours

187
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,644
after playing the game with us all day.

188
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:41,437
Here are your personal cards.

189
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,112
Here are the first community cards.

190
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,827
7high, you have bet one.

191
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,079
Kim Ha-rin, one.

192
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,248
Justin Min,

193
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,167
you have called one and raises three.

194
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,418
7high.

195
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,754
What's wrong?

196
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,714
I'm just tired.

197
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,591
Because we've been playing so long?

198
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:13,469
You have called.

199
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,554
Kim Ha-rin.

200
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,847
You have called.

201
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,808
Here are the remaining community cards.

202
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,477
7high, please place your second bet.

203
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,654
You have bet eight.

204
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,698
Oh, he's raised again?

205
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:35,366
Wow, he's going for it.

206
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:36,492
Kim Ha-rin.

207
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,289
You have called.

208
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,083
Justin Min.

209
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,127
I'll call.

210
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,045
You have called. Please bet eight.

211
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,755
-That's too…
-This is a big pot.

212
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,174
The sniping will now begin.

213
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,885
I will snipe 10 Straight.

214
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,679
You have sniped 10 Straight.

215
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,979
I will snipe 9 Two Pair.

216
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:07,481
-You have sniped 9 Two Pair.
-Yes.

217
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,400
-I think 7high's been sniped out.
-Really?

218
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:11,402
He raised his chin when he heard it.

219
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:12,653
Justin Min.

220
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:14,989
I will snipe 10 Pair.

221
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:16,866
-10 One Pair?
-Yes.

222
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,327
Justin Min, please reveal your cards.

223
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,582
It's 9 Two Pair.

224
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:25,625
Kim Ha-rin.

225
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,543
7 One Pair.

226
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,878
7 One Pair.

227
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:32,965
3 Three of a Kind, nice!

228
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,384
That was worth a punt.

229
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:40,931
Three of a Kind for 7high.

230
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,475
7high wins this round.

231
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,605
7high, well played!

232
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,024
-Should've betted more.
-I think you're done.

233
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:50,941
Not yet.

234
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,318
Oh, you're not done yet.

235
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,199
Still, I feel a bit relieved now.

236
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:00,743
I was so nervous earlier
that I couldn't move.

237
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,707
Here are the first community cards.

238
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,668
I got scared
when I saw the three of a kind.

239
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:11,003
Kim Ha-rin, please place your bet.

240
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,255
You have folded.

241
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,342
Justin Min wins by virtue of
having the highest card.

242
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:18,761
Here are the remaining community cards.

243
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,263
Justin Min, please place your second bet.

244
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:25,142
-Four chips.
-Gosh.

245
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,227
7high.

246
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,646
You have folded.

247
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:30,439
-Kim Ha-rin has folded.
-Nice.

248
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:31,524
Justin Min wins.

249
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,275
You still can't leave?

250
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,070
Justin's going to finish soon as well.

251
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:38,155
Here are the first community cards.

252
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:39,907
7high.

253
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:41,450
Three chips.

254
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,577
Kim Ha-rin has folded.

255
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,579
Justin Min has folded.

256
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:46,997
7high wins.

257
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,875
What was it that Ji-yeong regularly had?

258
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,836
Are you feeling a bit hungry?

259
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:55,423
No, it's to take with us tomorrow.
Some chocolate for Ha-rin if she makes it.

260
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:56,966
I really wanted to get her some.

261
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,468
I really hope
Ha-rin could stay here at least once.

262
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,470
Because she really loves to eat.

263
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,516
Here are the first two community cards.

264
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,643
Kim Ha-rin, please place your bet.

265
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:11,689
You have folded.

266
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,482
Justin Min, one.

267
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,151
7high.

268
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,779
You have called one and raised two.

269
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:20,948
Call.

270
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,285
Here are the remaining
two community cards.

271
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:26,412
Justin Min, please place your bet.

272
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:29,915
Four chips.

273
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,959
7high.

274
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,172
Call.

275
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,548
The sniping will now begin.

276
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:40,092
Justin Min, please make your snipe.

277
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,051
5 Two Pair.

278
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:43,220
You have sniped 5 Two Pair.

279
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,388
7high.

280
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,227
So he sniped 5 Two Pair…

281
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:52,855
Like a scene from a movie.

282
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:57,276
Don't you think we need
some imposing background music here?

283
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:59,320
No, it's like a scene from 007.

284
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:02,823
He looks so cool.
It's like he's a movie star.

285
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:05,284
-What's with you guys?
-He should do a movie.

286
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:09,371
-Wow, and the angle of this shot.
-7high paints a pretty picture!

287
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,333
The cameraman is good too,
filming him in the mirror like that.

288
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,918
-It's a great shot.
-Yeah.

289
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,173
That expression.

290
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,300
-That's some movie acting.
-Hey!

291
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:22,718
Hey, hey!

292
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,887
Justin's supposed to
be the Hollywood actor.

293
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,138
Jeez, 7high.

294
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,278
This is the most screen time
he's gotten so far!

295
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:43,697
What's he doing with his neck?

296
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,157
It's so erotic!

297
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,368
Please stop touching your neck.

298
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,453
That was so sexy just now. Look at that.

299
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:51,247
-Look at that vein.
-Hey!

300
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,207
He did that on purpose.

301
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,501
No wonder he wore a shirt
with a deep neckline.

302
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,628
It's intentional. Gosh, 7high.

303
00:13:58,212 --> 00:13:59,797
5 Full House.

304
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,550
You have sniped 5 Full House.

305
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:03,968
Yes, that's my target.

306
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:05,344
7high, please reveal your cards.

307
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,096
Triple fives.

308
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,853
7high wins this round.

309
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,271
Can you still not leave?

310
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,188
Nope, I can't.

311
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,773
-Still?
-No.

312
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,900
See that?
7high has regained his composure.

313
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,736
Yeah, when he speaks English,
he gets better. He needs more of that.

314
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,946
He's got it.

315
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,156
But that spells danger for Ha-rin.

316
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,825
Here are your personal cards.

317
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,787
Here are the first community cards.

318
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,873
It would be great if you had a 10.

319
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:38,544
One.

320
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:39,879
7high.

321
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:43,132
You have called one and raised two.

322
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,133
Kim Ha-rin.

323
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:45,759
Call.

324
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:46,927
Justin Min.

325
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:48,971
Call.

326
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:49,930
Go with it?

327
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,766
-He's in. I've got a feeling it's big.
-Ten?

328
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,477
-Ten chips minimum.
-All three are in it with more to reveal.

329
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,396
Here are the remaining community cards.

330
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:58,564
Justin Min.

331
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,066
One.

332
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,359
7high.

333
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:12,369
You have called one and raised four.

334
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:13,996
-Five?
-He raised.

335
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,707
That's insane. He's aiming to kill Ha-rin.

336
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,417
Kim Ha-rin.

337
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:29,887
Do I just need to bet another four?

338
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,263
If you want to call, it's five.

339
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,933
If you want to raise,
you have to bet more than that.

340
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:34,850
Call.

341
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:37,436
Justin Min.

342
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,979
I'll call too. Four more down?

343
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,606
Yes, put four more down.

344
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:41,523
Call.

345
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,942
They've all put in.

346
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,319
Did 7high think this through?
I think 30 is enough.

347
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:46,862
With 20 in each stack, that makes 60.

348
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,364
The sniping will now begin.

349
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,950
Justin Min, please make your snipe.

350
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,409
Triple twos.

351
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:55,079
You have sniped 2 Three of a Kind.

352
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,122
7high.

353
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,808
This is also a competition
of physical endurance.

354
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,768
I don't think he's one to get tired.

355
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,520
But now he's sitting down.

356
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,335
-I think Ha-rin has 10 Two Pair.
-Yeah, I think so too.

357
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:46,130
I will snipe 10 Two Pair.

358
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:49,049
7high has sniped 10 Two Pair.

359
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,135
10 Two Pair?

360
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:55,806
-Oh, I think you're right.
-Her expression says so, right?

361
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:59,768
I will snipe 2 Full House.

362
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,312
You have sniped 2 Full House.

363
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,023
I think Ha-rin has a Two Pair.

364
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,817
She probably sniped a Full House
because she has Two Pair.

365
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,819
Justin Min, please reveal your cards.

366
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:10,362
10 Two Pair.

367
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,865
Kim Ha-rin.

368
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,122
-2 Two Pair.
-2 Two Pair.

369
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:22,875
7high.

370
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:26,295
-What?
-See?

371
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:29,089
-It's anyone's game!
-Look. Two 2s!

372
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:31,967
Is it a Full House?

373
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,094
2 Three of a Kind.

374
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:37,806
Kim Ha-rin wins this round.

375
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:46,690
Ha-rin came in and took the pot
with 2 Two Pair.

376
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:50,652
I was flustered earlier because I thought
she really could've read my cards.

377
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:54,406
But this time, she played with cards
that neither of us could have guessed,

378
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,700
so I was shocked to see her win.

379
00:17:56,784 --> 00:18:00,162
Anyway, I think
that was Ha-rin's strategy,

380
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,581
and it came as a bit of a shock.

381
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:04,750
I had two good teachers next to me,

382
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,628
so I learnt a lot in real time.

383
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,129
Luck is also a skill.

384
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,801
-Ha-rin really played well.
-Ha-rin won?

385
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,761
What did Ha-rin have?

386
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:18,180
She had 2 Two Pair and won.

387
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,515
Nothing could've…

388
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:21,975
The lights are going out.

389
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,728
-They want us to watch in the dark.
-Really?

390
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,105
But this is way better.

391
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,440
-But this is bad for your eyes.
-True.

392
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:31,902
This is the first time the game has
lasted until lights out, right?

393
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,028
It's 11 o'clock.

394
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,613
Isn't it so fun today?

395
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,283
Here are the first community cards.

396
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,911
7high. Two chips.

397
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,705
Kim Ha-rin calls.

398
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,666
Justin Min calls.

399
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:47,417
Here are the remaining community cards.

400
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:50,045
-Wow, again?
-There's a Pair already.

401
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,214
-This is really difficult.
-Two, three, three…

402
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,466
It can make all kinds of hands.

403
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,884
There are so many options to snipe.

404
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,137
7high.

405
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,763
Unbelievable.

406
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:02,391
Why do the cards
keep coming out like that?

407
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,017
Is it a trick by the Devil?

408
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,064
One. Kim Ha-rin.

409
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,109
Call. Justin Min.

410
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:16,488
You have called one and raised two.

411
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:18,323
7high.

412
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,450
Why do you keep increasing the pot?

413
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,045
How many has he bet?

414
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,463
What the heck?

415
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:34,464
Ten?

416
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:35,424
Insane.

417
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,426
-He's just going for victory.
-Right.

418
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:38,677
You have bet a total of 11.

419
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,970
-Eleven!
-Eleven?

420
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:41,513
He wants Ha-rin to cough up ten chips.

421
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,140
-I think Ha-rin will fold.
-She should.

422
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:44,558
No, I don't think she'll play.

423
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:52,733
Eleven?

424
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,276
Eleven?

425
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,615
She's going for it.

426
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:00,532
No way.

427
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,576
Do I just need to bet an extra ten?

428
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:04,119
That'll be ten if you wish to call.

429
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,330
Call.

430
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:10,667
Justin Min folds.

431
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:12,920
The sniping will now begin.

432
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:14,004
7high.

433
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:22,387
Ha-rin looks surprisingly relaxed.
Does she have a good hand?

434
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,847
She might be pretending to.

435
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,732
I will snipe 10 Two Pair.

436
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:35,901
You have sniped 10 Two Pair.

437
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:37,611
Kim Ha-rin.

438
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:39,613
I will snipe a triple three.

439
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:41,990
-You have sniped Three of a Kind of 3.
-Yes.

440
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,618
Kim Ha-rin, please reveal your cards.

441
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:56,630
Kim Ha-rin wins this round.

442
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:57,631
Even though I raised…

443
00:20:57,714 --> 00:21:00,509
That's your third time having pockets.

444
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:04,638
There's no way that happened.
She got it again like that.

445
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:06,640
-Was it a Full House?
-She had pocket 4s.

446
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,478
Now I get it.

447
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:14,231
You know what?
Justin must be in shock now.

448
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:17,651
Because he had as many as 70,
and now he's lost a lot.

449
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:19,444
That's a lot of psychological pressure.

450
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,738
He was almost there
and has now dropped off.

451
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,699
Justin Min, you have folded.

452
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,118
7high, your snipe was successful,

453
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:27,327
and you win this round.

454
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:29,454
Justin Min, you have folded.

455
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,580
Justin Min,

456
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:32,040
you have folded.

457
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,667
7high wins this round.

458
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,045
They both almost died

459
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,172
and were brought back
from the brink of death.

460
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,590
Justin's in trouble now.

461
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:43,093
But if Justin takes their chips again…

462
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:44,678
Here are your personal cards.

463
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,938
Here are the first community cards.

464
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,023
Kim Ha-rin,

465
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:57,107
one.

466
00:21:58,859 --> 00:21:59,818
Justin Min, one.

467
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:00,986
7high.

468
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,159
You have raised three more.

469
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,994
Kim Ha-rin calls.

470
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:10,704
Justin Min.

471
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,500
-He's going to play.
-Justin too?

472
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,294
He bet even more. No?

473
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,593
You have bet a total of ten.

474
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:25,719
7high.

475
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:26,970
Wow, he did.

476
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:30,599
I think Justin is thinking,
"Those willing to die shall live."

477
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:36,313
Call.

478
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,440
-Kim Ha-rin.
-Fold.

479
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:39,691
You have folded.

480
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,110
Here are the remaining community cards.

481
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,904
Justin Min, please place your bet.

482
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:45,822
One.

483
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:46,948
7high.

484
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:52,079
Hang on, if 7high wins this, he's done.

485
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:55,582
Call.

486
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:57,125
The sniping will now begin.

487
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,127
Justin Min, please make your snipe.

488
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:04,091
I will go for 6 Pair.

489
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,759
-6 One Pair.
-Yes.

490
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:07,010
You have made your snipe.

491
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,220
7high.

492
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:10,680
I will snipe a 3 One Pair.

493
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:12,682
You have sniped 3 One Pair.

494
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:16,311
7high, please reveal your cards.

495
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:21,942
10 High Card.

496
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:22,859
10 High?

497
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:23,902
A 10?

498
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:25,320
-It's a 10 High.
-High Card?

499
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,328
-10 High Card?
-10 High Card.

500
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:55,350
THE DEVIL'S PLAN
DEATH ROOM

501
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,478
-10 High Card?
-10 High Card.

502
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,523
-That was precise.
-Good hand.

503
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,191
-7high wins the round.
-I did it.

504
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,235
You went for it with a 10 High Card?

505
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:08,321
-Both a 10 high, but…
-He won with that 8. That's insane!

506
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:10,824
7high has now secured more than 75 chips.

507
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:15,871
Well played. That was fun.

508
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:17,622
Please give me 75 of your chips.

509
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:21,001
You may give the remaining chips
to players of your choice.

510
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:23,211
I want to see this play out a bit longer.

511
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,007
Good luck.

512
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,967
-Well played.
-Everyone's so good.

513
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:35,348
7high, you have secured your survival.

514
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,559
Please return to the living space.

515
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:41,396
Wow, well done.

516
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,981
He isn't surprised.

517
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:45,025
It's not that. It's just so exhausting.

518
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:46,359
Right? Isn't it?

519
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:50,197
I mean, as I played,
I realized it wasn't really like Poker.

520
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,114
What?

521
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,782
When there were five of us…

522
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,910
-It was like Poker.
-…it was just like Poker.

523
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:57,662
But with less people,
it didn't really feel like Poker.

524
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,164
Please place your ante.

525
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:02,959
Here are your personal cards.

526
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,131
Here are the first community cards.

527
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,592
Justin Min, please place your bet.

528
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:13,720
Two chips.

529
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:15,597
Call.

530
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:19,392
Here are the remaining community cards.

531
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:20,393
Justin Min.

532
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:24,814
Three chips.

533
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:25,941
Kim Ha-rin.

534
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:33,198
Call.

535
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:34,699
The sniping will now begin.

536
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,785
Justin Min, please make your snipe.

537
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:42,290
-I'll snipe 9 Two Pair.
-You have sniped 9 Two Pair.

538
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:43,959
Kim Ha-rin, please make your snipe.

539
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:47,128
I will snipe 9 Full House.

540
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,548
You have sniped 9 Full House.

541
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:51,800
Kim Ha-rin, please reveal your cards.

542
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:54,594
-Triple nines.
-Triple nines.

543
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:58,056
Justin Min, 10 Two Pair.

544
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,100
Kim Ha-rin wins this round.

545
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:04,729
Justin has so few chips.

546
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:10,318
-When you have as few chips as that…
-You get antsy.

547
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,444
No, rather than that,

548
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:14,072
you're in a situation
where you don't really have control.

549
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:16,616
Right, from now on,
Ha-rin will just play it safe.

550
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,201
Here are your cards.

551
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,540
Here are the first community cards.

552
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:28,545
One chip.

553
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,006
Call.

554
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,591
Here are the remaining community cards.

555
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:37,178
Justin Min.

556
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:39,931
Four chips.

557
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,689
How many chips do you have left?

558
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,149
He has 14 chips left.

559
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,405
Oh? Is she going to bet all 14?

560
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,374
Amazing.

561
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:09,085
She's bold.
She must be super certain about it.

562
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:13,131
I have to bet 14 plus 4
if I want to raise, right?

563
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:16,134
-Since he bet four.
-Are you calling 4 and raising it by 14?

564
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:17,093
Yes.

565
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:19,929
You have raised 14 more.

566
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:26,269
Justin Min, you have folded.

567
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:28,605
He just folded.

568
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:38,615
Here are your cards.

569
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:40,533
Justin Min has folded.

570
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:41,910
Justin Min.

571
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,120
You have folded.

572
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:46,790
Wait, Justin doesn't even have ten chips?

573
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:48,958
I don't know, but he doesn't have many.

574
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,511
What are you doing?

575
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:02,555
Justin.

576
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,641
-You were so cool.
-For sure.

577
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,771
Here are the first community cards.

578
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,564
Kim Ha-rin.

579
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:12,982
One.

580
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:14,943
All in.

581
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:18,863
-See? I told you he would.
-All in?

582
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:21,658
I mean, he has such a
good understanding of the game.

583
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:26,037
You have gone all in with nine.

584
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:32,085
Fold.

585
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:33,294
You have folded.

586
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:36,506
Justin Min.

587
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,425
All in.

588
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:42,303
-You just keep on…
-Eleven chips.

589
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:46,015
I don't really have much choice.

590
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:47,142
-Since you don't…
-No.

591
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,935
-Fold.
-Kim Ha-rin has folded.

592
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:50,103
Justin Min.

593
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:52,981
-You will go on?
-All in.

594
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:54,023
Fold.

595
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:55,024
You have folded.

596
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,572
It's still anyone's game.

597
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:04,284
When Justin comes out strong like that,
Ha-rin can't help but get scared and fold.

598
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:05,744
Unless she's holding something.

599
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:07,036
Are you feeling tired?

600
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,204
A little bit.

601
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,582
Here are the first community cards.

602
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:13,668
Justin Min.

603
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,005
All in.

604
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:21,593
That's 14 chips.

605
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:25,221
I'm feeling so tired now, so…

606
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:30,018
Call.

607
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,436
-Did she call?
-Yes.

608
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:34,063
-She called.
-Is it game over?

609
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:37,859
Here are the remaining community cards.

610
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:41,988
The sniping will now begin.

611
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,409
There's a 3 One Pair on the table.

612
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:47,535
Justin Min.

613
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,251
8 Two Pair.

614
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:57,086
You have sniped 8 Two Pair.

615
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:58,963
Kim Ha-rin.

616
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:03,301
I will snipe 3 One Pair.

617
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:05,845
-You have sniped 3 One Pair.
-Yes.

618
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:07,388
Oh, no.

619
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,641
Will a High Card end it?

620
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:11,518
Kim Ha-rin, please reveal your cards.

621
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:13,728
It's 8 Two Pair.

622
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:14,687
8 Two Pair.

623
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:17,565
Justin Min.

624
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:20,944
3 One Pair.

625
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:23,112
You have both been sniped.

626
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,322
It is a draw.

627
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:30,328
Wow, that round was a great battle.

628
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:40,964
It's already midnight.

629
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:42,423
It's 12 o'clock.

630
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,217
It must be so tough for them.

631
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,468
Here are your cards.

632
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:51,891
Here are the first community cards.

633
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:54,811
Kim Ha-rin.

634
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:56,688
One.

635
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:57,730
Justin Min.

636
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:00,441
You have raised two more.

637
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:04,445
Kim Ha-rin.

638
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:06,447
Call.

639
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,241
Here are the remaining community cards.

640
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:11,953
-What the heck?
-That's 7, 6, 8, 9.

641
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:15,748
Wow, that's insane.

642
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:16,833
Kim Ha-rin.

643
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:25,300
One.

644
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:27,552
All in.

645
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:30,805
That's 11 chips.

646
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:38,688
Do you have a straight?

647
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:52,827
I'll fold.

648
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,078
I'll fold.

649
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:55,622
-You have folded.
-Yes.

650
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:57,290
I can't believe those cards.

651
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:01,336
I was stoked when I got a straight,

652
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:05,840
but it was so obvious
that it was bound to be sniped.

653
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,387
What's going on?
He's somehow got back up to 20.

654
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:12,805
She's not in her game.

655
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:15,183
Here are the remaining community cards.

656
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:18,436
Justin Min.

657
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:20,939
Five chips.

658
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:22,065
Kim Ha-rin.

659
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:23,232
-I will fold.
-Fold.

660
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:26,778
-Kim Ha-rin.
-I'll fold.

661
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:27,862
You have folded.

662
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:28,947
Justin Min.

663
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,033
You have raised five.

664
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:34,160
Kim Ha-rin.

665
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:35,328
-I'll fold.
-Fold.

666
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:41,167
Because she was scared,
I think she folded a lot.

667
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:47,840
The one being chased starts to get tired,

668
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:49,759
and the chaser gets revitalized.

669
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:52,804
Right, and then you start to get anxious.

670
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:54,722
Here are your cards.

671
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:03,106
Here are the first community cards.

672
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:04,482
Justin Min.

673
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:09,070
One.

674
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:10,530
Call.

675
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:13,574
Here are the remaining community cards.

676
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,327
Justin Min.

677
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:19,038
One.

678
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,123
Kim Ha-rin.

679
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,252
The killer expression has come out.

680
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,212
When she licks her lips like that.

681
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:29,841
You have called.

682
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:31,300
The sniping will now begin.

683
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:32,844
Justin Min.

684
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:35,596
-You don't wish to snipe?
-No.

685
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,848
You have forfeited your snipe.

686
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:43,896
Kim Ha-rin.

687
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:48,401
I will snipe 2 One Pair.

688
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:50,570
You have sniped 2 One Pair.

689
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:51,904
Kim Ha-rin, please reveal your cards.

690
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:54,866
A 5 High Card.

691
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:56,034
Justin Min.

692
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,539
2 One Pair.

693
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:03,875
Kim Ha-rin, your snipe was successful.

694
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,418
You win this round.

695
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:07,003
Well played.

696
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:08,504
-That's crazy.
-Did she win?

697
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:11,132
Yeah, she sniped the 2 One Pair
and won with a High Card.

698
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:14,385
I guess she sensed it
when he forfeited his snipe.

699
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:17,472
She must've trusted her snipe and called.

700
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:18,598
Yeah, her snipe.

701
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:26,105
Ha-rin is really amazing.

702
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:30,610
I don't know how she's playing so well,

703
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:34,030
when she has never played Poker before.

704
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:35,615
She's really good.

705
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:36,824
Here are your cards.

706
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,413
Here are the first community cards.

707
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:45,124
-I will fold.
-Kim Ha-rin has folded.

708
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,834
Here are your cards.

709
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,172
Here are the first community cards.

710
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:52,965
Justin Min.

711
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:54,509
I will fold.

712
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:56,219
You have folded.

713
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:58,304
For a beginner like me,

714
00:34:58,387 --> 00:35:01,724
I thought the right thing to do
was to play modestly.

715
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:04,602
To decrease the chances
that I fell for my opponent's bluffs,

716
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:07,814
I made an active effort to fold

717
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:11,109
when I had hands
that had a low probability of winning.

718
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:13,027
Let's stay up all night.

719
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:15,780
How can they keep playing
for three and a half hours?

720
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:17,698
I know, it's a battle of endurance.

721
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,450
Here are your cards.

722
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:26,874
Here are the first community cards.

723
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:29,418
Kim Ha-rin.

724
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:32,088
One.

725
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:33,673
Justin Min.

726
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:37,969
You have raised four.

727
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:42,348
Call.

728
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,518
Here are the remaining community cards.

729
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:54,986
Wow, three ones have come out.

730
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:56,696
Unbelievable.

731
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:04,120
-I think he'll go all in again.
-She's licking her lips again.

732
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:05,204
Kim Ha-rin.

733
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:20,553
One.

734
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:21,679
Justin Min.

735
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:25,641
All in.

736
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:29,437
-Good.
-Of course, he should go hard.

737
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:34,901
You can bet an extra 15.

738
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:36,611
Fifteen…

739
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,369
Ha-rin is going for it.

740
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:46,579
She's thinking about it.

741
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:48,998
Just do it, Ha-rin.
I hope she goes for it.

742
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:54,837
Here are 15.

743
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:57,673
Call.

744
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,136
It's over.

745
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:06,599
Is it over if she wins this?

746
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:08,684
It is. I reckon this is it.

747
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,144
The sniping will now begin.

748
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,313
Kim Ha-rin, please make your snipe.

749
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,732
As the player going first,

750
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:19,028
I also had to snipe first,
which has the risk of revealing my hand.

751
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:22,323
So I had to proceed cautiously
with my sniping.

752
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,158
I will not snipe.

753
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,409
You don't wish to snipe?

754
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:26,369
No.

755
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:28,037
-Oh, she's not doing it?
-What?

756
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,164
-Justin Min?
-Me neither.

757
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,916
You don't wish to snipe?

758
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:33,167
He's not sniping?

759
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,460
Could it be a winning hand?

760
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:35,962
Kim Ha-rin, please reveal your cards.

761
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:39,465
1 Full House.

762
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:42,385
Justin Min.

763
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,269
1 Full House.

764
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:54,272
After comparing your secondary cards,
Justin wins this round.

765
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:55,606
8 High!

766
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,441
-Wow, this game…
-Amazing.

767
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,986
How can it be like that? It's insane.

768
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:01,696
Seriously, this is…

769
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,239
I mean, what the heck?

770
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:04,490
This is unbelievable.

771
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:09,495
But Ha-rin also had a good hand.

772
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:12,957
That was huge.

773
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:15,459
That was a huge round.

774
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:18,379
Seriously. He just won after going all in.

775
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,172
The tables have turned.

776
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:22,008
-He overtook her?
-Yeah.

777
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:26,220
That will be 44 chips.

778
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:35,855
Even though I had fewer chips,
I wasn't worried.

779
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:42,403
Wow, Justin is awesome.

780
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:43,738
That's amazing.

781
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:44,947
So cool.

782
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:45,948
Ha-rin,

783
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,492
don't let it get to you.

784
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:51,787
Here are your cards.

785
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:54,165
-Kim Ha-rin.
-I'll fold.

786
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:55,207
You have folded.

787
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:56,500
Justin Min.

788
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,378
Three chips. Kim Ha-rin.

789
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:00,296
Fold.

790
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:01,213
You have folded.

791
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:03,090
Justin Min wins this round.

792
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,925
You're good.

793
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,719
Gosh, Justin takes it again.

794
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:08,804
Justin has got a second wind.

795
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:14,977
Here are your personal cards.

796
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:18,439
Here are the first community cards.

797
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:21,984
Kim Ha-rin.

798
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:24,320
One.

799
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:25,404
Justin Min.

800
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:28,824
You have raised four.

801
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:31,827
Call.

802
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,122
Here are the remaining community cards.

803
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:37,750
Kim Ha-rin.

804
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:41,879
One. Justin Min.

805
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:57,853
-Trying to draw her in?
-Yeah, I think so.

806
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:59,730
If he looks too confident, she might fold.

807
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:02,358
I guess Justin has something.

808
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:09,949
You have called one and raised seven.

809
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:12,660
I think he might have a good hand.

810
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:13,786
Kim Ha-rin.

811
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:15,246
Seven more?

812
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:21,335
Call.

813
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:24,171
That's crazy.

814
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:26,715
The sniping will now begin.

815
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:29,552
Kim Ha-rin, please make your snipe.

816
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,974
I will snipe 6 One Pair.

817
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:37,393
-You have sniped 6 One Pair.
-Yes.

818
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:38,394
Justin Min.

819
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:42,940
I will snipe 3 One Pair.

820
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:45,734
You have sniped 3 One Pair.

821
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,194
Kim Ha-rin, reveal your cards.

822
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:50,781
3 One Pair.

823
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:51,782
Justin Min.

824
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,790
Justin Min, your snipe was successful.

825
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:01,584
You win this round.

826
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,171
That's crazy. He sniped 3 One Pair.

827
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:06,755
How did he do that?

828
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:08,466
Justin is so cool.

829
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:11,051
-So is Ha-rin. She went for it.
-Exactly.

830
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:19,935
Please place your ante.

831
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,688
Here are your cards.

832
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,234
Here are the first community cards.

833
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:32,031
Kim Ha-rin.

834
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:34,950
One.

835
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:36,076
Justin Min.

836
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:39,747
You've called one and raised four.

837
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:40,664
Kim Ha-rin.

838
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:43,626
I'll match you.
I don't have much of a choice.

839
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:45,169
-All right. Yes.
-Right?

840
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:46,837
Here are the remaining community cards.

841
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:50,007
One, four, nine, six.

842
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:53,052
There's no Straight,
so it's a fight between Pairs.

843
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:54,220
Kim Ha-rin.

844
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:58,933
One.

845
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:00,518
Justin Min.

846
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:03,896
She has five left.

847
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:05,356
Okay, I will raise five more.

848
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:08,567
You have called one and raised five.

849
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,778
He's making her go all in.

850
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:14,740
Kim Ha-rin, all in.

851
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:16,408
-Wow, all in?
-Focus.

852
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:21,705
The sniping will now begin.

853
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,791
Kim Ha-rin, please make your snipe.

854
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,751
I will snipe 4 One Pair.

855
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:28,128
You have sniped 4 One Pair.

856
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:29,129
Justin Min.

857
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:31,507
6 One Pair.

858
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:33,676
You have sniped 6 One Pair.

859
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:35,219
Kim Ha-rin, please reveal your cards.

860
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:42,268
3 One Pair.

861
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:43,519
3 One Pair.

862
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:44,603
Justin Min.

863
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:50,276
9 One Pair.

864
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:53,404
Justin Min wins the match.

865
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:54,905
Well played.

866
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:57,491
Well played. Honestly.

867
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,118
-I'm sorry.
-So well played.

868
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:01,453
-Don't be.
-Really, you played really well.

869
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:02,371
It was fun.

870
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:04,164
-Oh, no.
-Ha-rin.

871
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:06,750
-She played really well.
-She was right earlier.

872
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:10,254
-She was against two Poker players.
-Yeah, on either side of her.

873
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:11,672
Considering that, she did really well.

874
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:15,718
Justin Min is the last player
to secure his survival.

875
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:19,346
Really well played.

876
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,557
Having been unable to
secure her own survival,

877
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:26,478
Kim Ha-rin becomes the fifth player
eliminated from The Devil's Plan.

878
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:27,813
ELIMINATED
KIM HA-RIN

879
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:30,024
I'm the only one who gets to
say goodbye to you?

880
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:32,860
Thank you.

881
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:37,448
That's heartbreaking.
They were prison mates the entire time.

882
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:38,407
You're right.

883
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:40,826
-You played so well.
-Thank you, thank you.

884
00:43:40,909 --> 00:43:42,745
-You've done well.
-Yes.

885
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:47,833
Actually, I've always really liked shows
where you have to use your brain.

886
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:50,669
When I was in middle and high school,

887
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:53,339
I was only allowed to watch TV
for two hours a week,

888
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:54,715
because of my studies.

889
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:56,842
But of those two hours,

890
00:43:56,925 --> 00:44:00,638
I used an hour and a half
watching shows like this

891
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:03,599
and watched anime
for the remaining 30 minutes.

892
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:08,395
I've always put the things I had to do

893
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,439
before the things I wanted to do,

894
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:12,608
so I've been feeling anxious and chased.

895
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:14,610
I think my life has been like that.

896
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:17,613
The Devil's Plan was really…

897
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:22,242
I think

898
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:24,870
it was the first time in my life
I'd chosen

899
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:29,541
something that I wanted to do
rather than I had to do.

900
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:32,044
It was so much fun.

901
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:38,008
Kim Ha-rin, please
leave this place immediately.

902
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:53,065
Ha-rin, well played!

903
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:55,651
-Well played, Ha-rin.
-Well played.

904
00:44:57,903 --> 00:45:00,155
Justin, seriously…

905
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:04,868
That was amazing, Justin.

906
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:05,786
Bravo.

907
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:07,579
It feels like the return of the king.

908
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:24,763
What will Ji-yeong say to me tomorrow?

909
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:27,558
-She's not gonna trust you at all.
-She'll go at it again.

910
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:30,686
One of my musical numbers
at the end of Act One,

911
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:33,939
is called "Once Again" from Frankenstein,
the one that you saw.

912
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:34,857
"Once Again."

913
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:38,277
So, the song is called "Once Again,"
and the lyrics…

914
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:40,070
The lyrics go,

915
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:44,742
Is the curse starting again?

916
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:45,784
I remember now.

917
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:50,706
I struggled to escape that fate

918
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:56,378
As if I am stuck in a loop

919
00:45:56,462 --> 00:46:01,717
Hey, it would be amazing if that was added
as background music with your voice.

920
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:02,843
That's so funny.

921
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:05,888
I think the curse will start tomorrow.

922
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:08,974
I feel like I'll end up in prison
with Ji-yeong tomorrow.

923
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:11,560
During the main match,

924
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:13,896
it felt like we were
making an alliance to bulk up

925
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:17,691
and become the huge corporation
that bullies small business owners.

926
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:21,653
But I thought
it was actually disadvantageous.

927
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:22,946
If you think about it,

928
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:26,950
maybe we didn't understand the first
and second main matches properly,

929
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:28,494
so we couldn't find the loophole.

930
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:29,912
But today,

931
00:46:29,995 --> 00:46:32,039
I realized that there's always a loophole.

932
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:35,375
-There is. Yeah, I thought the same.
-No matter how big or small,

933
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,586
I just thought there was something there.

934
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:38,837
I thought so too.

935
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:40,923
The big thing about today's game was that

936
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:43,467
if you eliminated someone,
you got their Pieces.

937
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:47,095
That was a huge opportunity
we were given today,

938
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:48,096
in the main match.

939
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:50,307
-Right.
-But we only knew…

940
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:51,558
After it was over.

941
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:52,851
We didn't realize it.

942
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:54,061
We didn't know.

943
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:56,396
Moreover, we could have even won.

944
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,356
Exactly.

945
00:46:57,439 --> 00:46:59,233
In many ways, the game was so balanced.

946
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:02,528
We didn't think ahead and
attempted a nine-man alliance, right?

947
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:04,488
But now that I think about it,

948
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:06,073
it wasn't exactly their fault.

949
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:08,951
I was also tempted by
the forbidden fruit that they offered.

950
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:10,953
I thought that
if I just played along with them…

951
00:47:11,036 --> 00:47:12,746
That you'd be safe for a while.

952
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,456
…that the herd would be thinned out.

953
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:17,709
And when the time comes,
I could start taking it seriously.

954
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:19,002
I was being complacent.

955
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:21,922
But what I felt today was that

956
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:25,425
there's no reason
for those with many Pieces to do that.

957
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:27,803
Well, it's 1:30 now. For another day…

958
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:28,720
Let's go to bed.

959
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:31,014
Whew, what a day.
Let's have one last toast.

960
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:33,642
-Congrats for surviving another day.
-Good luck tomorrow.

961
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:35,102
-Good job.
-Good luck.

962
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:36,937
Today is done.

963
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,146
Well done today.

964
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:41,024
We really went through a lot.
And, Hyun-joon, welcome to this side.

965
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:42,693
-Well played.
-Well played.

966
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:44,486
What a long day.

967
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:56,874
I need to get rid of him.

968
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:59,042
Did something happen
between you and Justin today?

969
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:00,252
He killed Ha-rin.

970
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:02,629
To be honest, I think you have to do it.

971
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:03,547
Why?

972
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:05,757
I was in prison with them both.
They both mean a lot to me.

973
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:07,092
Don't worry about that.

974
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:09,928
-Don't worry.
-Just be practical?

975
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:11,179
-For sure.
-Okay.

976
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:13,682
There are no eternal enemies
or eternal friends.

977
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:16,977
If you like someone, you can be friends
with them once we get out of here.

978
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,729
You can't get confused about that.

979
00:48:18,812 --> 00:48:19,855
We're all

980
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:22,024
here to win.

981
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:23,025
True.

982
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:25,027
Normally, if you betray or lie,

983
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:29,698
you'll get hurt
and your relationship will be ruined.

984
00:48:29,781 --> 00:48:31,658
But in here,

985
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:33,410
it's allowed.

986
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:36,079
In fact, it's what
we're supposed to do to win.

987
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:37,122
ROOM 2

988
00:48:37,205 --> 00:48:39,207
What will happen tomorrow?

989
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:42,502
You know, I find it funny
that we're always talking like this.

990
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:45,881
-Yes, Kyuhyun.
-Our chat at the end of every day.

991
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:49,134
We can't do anything
about that friend tomorrow, but…

992
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:53,055
I just hope you and So-hui
will be here tomorrow.

993
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:55,390
I think I'll be in jail tomorrow.

994
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:57,017
I can't avoid it.

995
00:48:57,684 --> 00:48:59,019
Always a possibility.

996
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:00,437
Let's get some sleep.

997
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,688
Get some sleep, Hyun-joon.

998
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:04,483
I'm glad we're sharing a room
and had the chance to chat.

999
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:07,402
ROOM 1

1000
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:23,085
We get a different dish here
every morning.

1001
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:25,045
We even have kimchi.

1002
00:49:30,884 --> 00:49:33,595
Don't you think this is the best
breakfast we've had so far, Justin?

1003
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:34,763
-Right.
-Really?

1004
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:36,223
This porridge is the tastiest.

1005
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:37,849
This is like hotel room service.

1006
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:39,851
-They even bring it all the way here.
-Yes.

1007
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:41,061
I've been meaning to ask.

1008
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:43,855
When you leave prison
and go to play the game,

1009
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:48,026
you know how we've been
bringing you food from the living area?

1010
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:50,195
Personally, I needed some protein.

1011
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:53,407
We don't get any protein over here.

1012
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:56,785
So I was really grateful
when you brought protein.

1013
00:49:56,868 --> 00:50:00,288
I saw him zombie over
to the protein drink in my hand.

1014
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:02,958
He walks to me
while eyeing the protein drink.

1015
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:04,668
Right, that's right.

1016
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:06,628
This is so delicious.

1017
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:08,463
He really means it.

1018
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:10,716
-I only had porridge there.
-Just porridge?

1019
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:12,342
Bread for dinner
and porridge for breakfast?

1020
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:14,136
-They don't give you any protein?
-No protein.

1021
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:15,804
That's why you all asked for protein.

1022
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:17,514
The fishcake soup is really good.

1023
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:20,142
Even though I know I should be eating…

1024
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:22,185
-I can't.
-Right?

1025
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:24,396
You've all been here so long,
you can't eat.

1026
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:27,649
I'm a bit self-conscious
because I've spent too long in prison.

1027
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:29,860
I have to be very careful right now.

1028
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:31,236
About everything I do.

1029
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:33,739
I'm worried they might say something
in the bathroom

1030
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:35,866
or when they're working out,

1031
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:37,951
so I joined them lifting weights.

1032
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:39,453
Two! Okay.

1033
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,371
Well done.

1034
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:44,416
You never know
if today might be your last day.

1035
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:47,961
Valentino, Valentino.

1036
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:51,298
-Did you call me?
-Oh, no, I was talking to myself.

1037
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,509
What are we going to do about Hyun-joon?

1038
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:56,762
Hyun-joon didn't say anything
about playing together,

1039
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:58,305
but anyway,

1040
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:02,934
I think Hyun-gyu, you,
and So-hui are totally in sync,

1041
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:04,853
and we shouldn't forget about 7high.

1042
00:51:04,936 --> 00:51:07,939
So, 7high and Hyun-joon
are a little bit more on the outside?

1043
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:09,191
Well, I do like 7high,

1044
00:51:09,274 --> 00:51:12,444
but he tends to come on strong,
so the others are wary of him.

1045
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:13,779
Is this the deal we made earlier?

1046
00:51:13,862 --> 00:51:14,988
Can you handle me?

1047
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:18,075
If this is what you decide,
I will destroy all of you.

1048
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:21,036
He says he did so because
he didn't know on the first day,

1049
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:24,289
but still, if he'd been less aggressive,
it would've been okay.

1050
00:51:24,372 --> 00:51:28,794
7high and I never had anything.
I was just following after you.

1051
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:30,504
I would've switched sides for a Piece.

1052
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:32,881
I don't think 7high and Hyun-gyu can be

1053
00:51:32,964 --> 00:51:35,550
-on the same team ever.
-It's over for them?

1054
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:41,765
Why is everyone so quiet this morning?

1055
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:42,724
Here?

1056
00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:44,726
It's never been this quiet before.

1057
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:46,561
It feels different from yesterday,
doesn't it?

1058
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:50,649
Yes, today I feel like I want to have
a showdown or something.

1059
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:52,818
Right? You're all fired up now, right?

1060
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:53,860
A little bit, yes.

1061
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:56,029
I don't fear being in prison now.

1062
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:58,406
It's the fourth day, and I think

1063
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:00,450
it's going to be a decisive day for me.

1064
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:03,912
The way I see it,
we're all carrying a shiv on us now.

1065
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:06,832
Of course. My thoughts
have changed after coming here.

1066
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:10,043
I think that game yesterday was huge.
It awakened me.

1067
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:11,878
I need to be more active.

1068
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:14,339
-You're right.
-I shouldn't be swayed by those guys…

1069
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:16,466
I realized while
watching Justin yesterday.

1070
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:18,468
There are people like him competing alone,

1071
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:22,055
so why was I so scared
to act the way I did?

1072
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:25,350
Still, let's play together today.

1073
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:29,229
I'm sure they think
they can dominate the board right now.

1074
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:31,648
I definitely think there'll be a gap,

1075
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:34,359
a spot that can
completely change the game.

1076
00:52:34,442 --> 00:52:36,862
And when we find it,
if any of us need help,

1077
00:52:36,945 --> 00:52:38,321
we should definitely…

1078
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:40,699
And I'm only asking this
because of Justin.

1079
00:52:40,782 --> 00:52:43,827
Justin, do you feel
more comfortable playing alone?

1080
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:46,454
-Much more comfortable.
-You prefer playing by yourself?

1081
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:50,041
Justin will help
if there's good reason for it.

1082
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:02,179
I have no idea what'll happen today.

1083
00:53:02,929 --> 00:53:04,097
Let's go.

1084
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:05,932
Gosh, time for the main match?

1085
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:08,685
The main match will begin shortly.

1086
00:53:09,394 --> 00:53:11,938
All players, please make your way
to the game area.

1087
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:12,981
I'm scared!

1088
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:21,031
-Good morning!
-There's a table.

1089
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:23,617
-It's an auction today.
-An auction.

1090
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,368
-What?
-There's an auction booth.

1091
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:28,413
We'll have to fix the auction.
We have to fix it.

1092
00:53:29,998 --> 00:53:31,291
Welcome!

1093
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:33,877
Our numbers sure have dwindled.

1094
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:34,961
There's not many of us.

1095
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:36,546
Let the game begin, shall we?

1096
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:37,589
Welcome.

1097
00:53:37,672 --> 00:53:38,590
Let's do this!

1098
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:39,883
-Thank you.
-Well played.

1099
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:42,886
Take two. Well played.
We watched everything yesterday.

1100
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:45,889
Good job yesterday.

1101
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:46,848
7high!

1102
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:48,141
I made you some coffee.

1103
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:49,309
Thankies.

1104
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:50,227
You were great yesterday.

1105
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:52,771
-Would you like some tteokbokki?
-Oh, amazing. Thanks.

1106
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:55,148
-Can I really eat this? Thank you.
-Sure.

1107
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:56,650
Isn't the living area nice?

1108
00:53:56,733 --> 00:54:00,695
No, I wanted to be together,
so I felt a bit bad.

1109
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:02,113
Good morning.

1110
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:06,451
The fourth main match
of The Devil's Plan will begin now.

1111
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:08,745
Kim Ha-rin was eliminated

1112
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:10,705
in yesterday's prison match,

1113
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:14,501
which leaves nine surviving players.

1114
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:16,836
Before we begin,

1115
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,965
here is the current Piece count
of each player.

1116
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:25,553
Currently,
Choi Hyun-joon possesses the most Pieces.

1117
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:26,930
They split their Pieces six each.

1118
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:30,976
Let me introduce the fourth main match.

1119
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:33,478
Today's main match is

1120
00:54:33,561 --> 00:54:35,313
Treasure Island.

1121
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:39,442
Treasure Island is a game
where you have to place arrows on a board

1122
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:41,820
to find a treasure chest.

1123
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:46,616
The board consists
of a total of 81 squares,

1124
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:49,244
and there are land squares,

1125
00:54:49,327 --> 00:54:50,996
water squares,

1126
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:52,414
fences,

1127
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:54,332
and walls.

1128
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:58,420
There are a total of ten boxes
on the land squares,

1129
00:54:58,503 --> 00:55:00,880
one of which is a treasure chest.

1130
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:06,678
The ten boxes contain clues
to find the treasure chest,

1131
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:10,473
and you will receive varying amounts
of points each time you open one.

1132
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:14,352
The game will be played
over a total of nine rounds,

1133
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:19,482
consisting of five arrow auction rounds
and four exploration rounds.

1134
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:22,402
You get arrows in the auctions

1135
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:24,904
and use them in the exploration rounds

1136
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:27,157
to try and find the treasure chest.

1137
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:30,076
Before the game starts,

1138
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:33,621
each player will be given one arrow.

1139
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:38,752
First, here are the rules
of the arrow auction round.

1140
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:41,171
In the auction,

1141
00:55:41,254 --> 00:55:45,300
11 to 13 arrows will be put up for sale.

1142
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:52,182
Each player is given 20 auction chips
that can be used during the auction.

1143
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:56,686
Auction chips shall be stored
in the auction booth

1144
00:55:56,770 --> 00:56:00,106
and shall be taken out and
submitted to the dealer when bidding.

1145
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:03,568
At this time, you must submit

1146
00:56:03,651 --> 00:56:06,696
at least one chip to bid on an arrow.

1147
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:09,699
And the number of chips you submit

1148
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:12,285
is not disclosed to other players.

1149
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:14,746
After all players have submitted chips,

1150
00:56:14,829 --> 00:56:20,585
players take the arrow they want
in order of biggest to lowest bid.

1151
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:23,171
When multiple players submit the same bid,

1152
00:56:23,254 --> 00:56:26,132
priority shall be given to
the player with more Pieces.

1153
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:27,300
No fair!

1154
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:29,886
If multiple players have
the same number of Pieces,

1155
00:56:29,969 --> 00:56:32,180
they shall draw lots to decide the order.

1156
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:34,474
Auction chips
cannot be transferred to other players,

1157
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:37,727
and arrows may not be modified or damaged.

1158
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:41,689
Next, here are the rules
of the exploration round.

1159
00:56:42,273 --> 00:56:46,277
When the exploration round starts,
players can enter the dealer room

1160
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:50,907
and place the arrows they have
on the game board to explore.

1161
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:55,370
At this time, arrows cannot
be transferred or exchanged,

1162
00:56:55,453 --> 00:56:58,540
but they can be borrowed
and used by mutual agreement

1163
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:01,000
but only one per exploration round.

1164
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:04,712
Each exploration round shall last
a total of 40 minutes,

1165
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:08,091
and players may enter at any time
during those 40 minutes.

1166
00:57:08,716 --> 00:57:11,928
Players may stay in the dealer room
for a maximum of three minutes,

1167
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:15,515
and they must complete the placement of
their arrows within that time.

1168
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:21,020
The first arrow must always
be placed on the starting spot.

1169
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:27,152
All arrows must start and end
with the red dot on the arrow

1170
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:30,947
being in contact
with a red dot on the game board.

1171
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:34,284
Players can connect a new arrow
to the end of an existing arrow,

1172
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:37,954
and there is no limit to the number of
arrows that can be connected in this way.

1173
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:41,207
However, except for
the start and end points,

1174
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:43,460
arrows must not touch each other.

1175
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,671
When the arrowhead reaches a box,

1176
00:57:46,754 --> 00:57:49,090
the player can open the box.

1177
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:51,676
At this time, they may also choose

1178
00:57:51,759 --> 00:57:55,930
to continue to connect another arrow
to another box without opening the box.

1179
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:59,392
If your arrow connects
to your desired box,

1180
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:02,937
you can open that box
to get a clue and some points.

1181
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:07,859
Arrows that have been used once
are temporarily withheld

1182
00:58:07,942 --> 00:58:10,487
and cannot be reused in the same round.

1183
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:14,240
Withheld arrows
shall be returned to players

1184
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:15,825
at the start of the next round.

1185
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:18,703
If, after opening a box,
a player has arrows remaining,

1186
00:58:18,786 --> 00:58:21,915
they may connect those arrows
from the starting point

1187
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:24,209
and attempt to explore a new box.

1188
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:30,173
At this time, you cannot open a box
that you have already opened.

1189
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:33,593
When all players
have finished the exploration round,

1190
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:36,304
the player who opened each box first

1191
00:58:36,387 --> 00:58:39,599
will get the points
corresponding to that box.

1192
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:43,937
Thereafter, the points for opened boxes
shall be fixed at five points,

1193
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:48,441
and subsequent players opening those boxes
shall get five points.

1194
00:58:49,108 --> 00:58:53,571
Players may check the clues in any box
during the game by paying one Piece.

1195
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:56,908
Checking a box in this way
shall not accrue any points.

1196
00:58:57,534 --> 00:59:00,411
The game shall end in one of two ways.

1197
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:01,621
First,

1198
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:05,250
if one of the players
finds the treasure chest.

1199
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:06,376
Second,

1200
00:59:06,459 --> 00:59:08,753
if no one finds the treasure chest

1201
00:59:08,836 --> 00:59:11,923
by the time
the last exploration round ends.

1202
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:15,301
The player who opens the treasure chest

1203
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:18,096
shall be given a special Piece reward.

1204
00:59:18,179 --> 00:59:19,013
Okay.

1205
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:22,225
I will explain in detail
what the special Piece reward is

1206
00:59:22,308 --> 00:59:25,019
if the treasure chest is opened.

1207
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:27,355
When the game ends,

1208
00:59:27,438 --> 00:59:30,692
players with a final score of 31 points
or more shall receive a Piece,

1209
00:59:30,775 --> 00:59:34,487
players with 41 points or more
shall receive 2 Pieces.

1210
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:39,701
Players scoring 20 points or less
shall pay a penalty.

1211
00:59:39,784 --> 00:59:42,245
One Piece must be submitted
for a score of 20 points or less,

1212
00:59:42,328 --> 00:59:45,248
and two Pieces
for a score of 10 points or less.

1213
00:59:46,457 --> 00:59:48,418
Next, here are rules
of today's prize mission.

1214
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:53,715
If only one player is eliminated
by the end of today's main match,

1215
00:59:53,798 --> 00:59:56,342
100 million won will be added
to the final prize.

1216
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:58,219
It's a lot. It's 100 million again.

1217
00:59:58,303 --> 00:59:59,637
And it will be, it seems.

1218
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:03,850
The game will start in an hour.

1219
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:07,061
Spend this time as you wish.

1220
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:09,188
My first thought is

1221
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:12,650
that it's important to do well
in the auctions.

1222
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:14,777
An auction is a battle of numbers anyway,

1223
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:18,489
so I thought that it'd be better
to be in a loose alliance

1224
01:00:18,573 --> 01:00:20,366
without strict conditions

1225
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:23,161
so that I could get information and help
from more people.

1226
01:00:23,244 --> 01:00:25,288
Tinno, what are you thinking?

1227
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:27,624
But it seems like you guys are together.

1228
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:30,627
No, we're in the same position,
that's why we were talking.

1229
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:31,919
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

1230
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:35,131
No, no, I was genuinely asking. It's okay.

1231
01:00:35,214 --> 01:00:36,758
First of all,

1232
01:00:36,841 --> 01:00:39,886
I've been playing with Kyuhyun,
Hyun-gyu, and So-hui all along.

1233
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:42,639
So, you want to stick with that?
Okay, got it.

1234
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:44,891
I don't think there'll
be any alliance with Tinno.

1235
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:53,733
A Piece for a score of 20 points or less,

1236
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:56,611
and two Pieces
for a score of 10 points or less.

1237
01:01:03,618 --> 01:01:06,162
Justin, I think
we have to play this as a team

1238
01:01:06,245 --> 01:01:09,123
because it's going to be so hard
if we don't share clues.

1239
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:11,626
The clue, the clue? Yeah.

1240
01:01:11,709 --> 01:01:14,504
And we should also
work together for the auctions.

1241
01:01:14,587 --> 01:01:16,339
If you go it alone,

1242
01:01:16,422 --> 01:01:18,925
you probably won't be
able to get the arrows you need.

1243
01:01:19,717 --> 01:01:20,593
Here it is.

1244
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:29,352
-I found it. Come quickly.
-What is it?

1245
01:01:29,435 --> 01:01:31,729
There should be ten.
But let's count. How many are there?

1246
01:01:31,813 --> 01:01:34,148
It's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

1247
01:01:34,232 --> 01:01:36,317
-And?
-1, 2, 3, 4… there's one missing, right?

1248
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:38,444
So which color is missing? I kept looking.

1249
01:01:39,737 --> 01:01:42,115
It's brown. The same color as the board.

1250
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:44,492
-It's on empty land somewhere.
-You're right. It's hidden.

1251
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:46,661
The ultimate goal of the game

1252
01:01:46,744 --> 01:01:50,873
is to find the one treasure chest
among the ten boxes.

1253
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:54,252
Consequently, the location of the box
that has not been revealed

1254
01:01:54,335 --> 01:01:57,171
must be treasure chest.

1255
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:58,339
It's somewhere here.

1256
01:01:58,423 --> 01:01:59,757
So we have to dig it up.

1257
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:00,883
Exactly. We have to dig.

1258
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:02,427
Come quickly, come quickly.

1259
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:04,303
Come quickly, this is important.

1260
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:06,139
It's all bait, but ultimately,

1261
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:08,099
the brown is dirt.

1262
01:02:08,182 --> 01:02:09,726
-It's where the treasure is.
-Yeah.

1263
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:12,645
You can cross over the water.

1264
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:13,980
Oh, you can?

1265
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:15,898
Because you just have to
arrive on a red dot.

1266
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:16,899
Oh, right.

1267
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:18,651
So you can cross over the water,

1268
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:22,029
but there are no red dots, so I think it's
okay as long as you don't end on water.

1269
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:24,282
So you can't join two arrows over water.

1270
01:02:24,365 --> 01:02:25,199
You can't.

1271
01:02:25,283 --> 01:02:27,618
So these are all the treasure boxes?

1272
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:29,662
Right. It's these.

1273
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:32,457
Then the route… Are all these bait?

1274
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:35,376
But to be honest,
you can get this sky blue one right away.

1275
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:38,546
Yes, but if you go for this one,
I think you get five points

1276
01:02:38,629 --> 01:02:39,922
and some basic information.

1277
01:02:40,506 --> 01:02:43,301
Each box is assigned
a different amount of points.

1278
01:02:43,384 --> 01:02:45,344
For the first person to open the box,

1279
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:47,847
the green and sky blue boxes
have five points,

1280
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:50,516
the yellow, white, and brown boxes
have eight points,

1281
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,769
the pink and blue have 12 points,

1282
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:57,857
and the red, orange,
and purple boxes have 15 points.

1283
01:02:57,940 --> 01:03:01,652
Points for subsequent visitors
that open boxes are fixed at five points,

1284
01:03:01,736 --> 01:03:05,698
so it's important to take
the high-value boxes quickly.

1285
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:09,619
If you're going to get one,
this blue one behind it is worth 12.

1286
01:03:09,702 --> 01:03:11,120
So it's better to get this.

1287
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:13,289
You have to go far. This is a freebie.

1288
01:03:13,372 --> 01:03:14,957
They're just giving it to us.

1289
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:16,334
You can borrow arrows?

1290
01:03:16,417 --> 01:03:18,002
You can do it each round, right?

1291
01:03:18,085 --> 01:03:18,920
Yes, but if I use it,

1292
01:03:19,003 --> 01:03:21,088
you can't use it in the same round,

1293
01:03:21,172 --> 01:03:22,590
because it is kept temporarily,

1294
01:03:22,673 --> 01:03:26,093
so it's good to have various arrow pieces.

1295
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:29,764
This works. This one. Like this.

1296
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:37,480
The starting point is here.
It starts from the other side

1297
01:03:37,563 --> 01:03:39,607
You have to start from the red dot.

1298
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:42,610
You've got it back to front.
We can't afford to get that confused.

1299
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:44,695
But can't we flip it over?

1300
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:46,697
-Can we reverse them?
-I think we can.

1301
01:03:46,781 --> 01:03:48,783
-You mean to invert it?
-Yes, like a mirror.

1302
01:03:49,742 --> 01:03:52,203
Excuse me, there are arrows

1303
01:03:52,286 --> 01:03:55,373
shaped like this,
and others shaped like this.

1304
01:03:55,456 --> 01:03:57,458
Can we flip it like this?

1305
01:03:58,793 --> 01:04:01,045
Can we use it like that?
Changing its direction.

1306
01:04:01,128 --> 01:04:04,882
Each arrow must
start and end on a red dot.

1307
01:04:07,301 --> 01:04:08,427
I know that.

1308
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:11,347
So you're saying this can't be flipped…

1309
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:14,183
Or we can if we want?

1310
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:16,769
Each arrow must
start and end on a red dot.

1311
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:17,770
Right.

1312
01:04:21,899 --> 01:04:22,775
How about you?

1313
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:24,193
The arrow must start

1314
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:25,736
-and end on a red dot.
-And end on a red dot.

1315
01:04:29,073 --> 01:04:30,324
I understand.

1316
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:40,543
I think it's okay

1317
01:04:40,626 --> 01:04:43,379
because I kept asking if we could flip it.

1318
01:04:44,255 --> 01:04:46,340
"Each arrow must
start and end on a red dot."

1319
01:04:46,424 --> 01:04:49,886
Then there are no restrictions
on how to use the arrow.

1320
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:53,556
Oh, damn. I guess we can't go outside
the boundaries of the board, right?

1321
01:04:54,765 --> 01:04:56,309
That was such a stupid question.

1322
01:04:56,392 --> 01:04:57,560
Can we not?

1323
01:04:57,643 --> 01:04:58,853
I don't think so.

1324
01:04:58,936 --> 01:05:00,354
Does it work if we do?

1325
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:03,065
-If we can do it like this?
-Is that allowed?

1326
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:04,942
-I'll go and ask.
-Just ask that one thing.

1327
01:05:07,612 --> 01:05:10,364
Is it okay to go out
like this and come back in?

1328
01:05:10,948 --> 01:05:14,493
Each arrow must
start and end on a red dot.

1329
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:15,411
Thank you.

1330
01:05:15,494 --> 01:05:17,705
The answer is "Each arrow
must start and end on a red dot."

1331
01:05:19,498 --> 01:05:20,374
I think it works.

1332
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:23,461
That's it.
We have to calculate it like this.

1333
01:05:23,544 --> 01:05:26,672
Because they said red to red,
it's possible, right?

1334
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:27,757
Let's think about that.

1335
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:30,092
As long as it reaches its end,
it doesn't matter?

1336
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:31,886
Let's consider it a possibility.

1337
01:05:31,969 --> 01:05:33,930
So, we'll just skip the first auction?

1338
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:37,516
We'll just pick two or three
from whatever's left.

1339
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:41,312
After we do one, the rest is hearsay.
One and two overlap anyway.

1340
01:05:41,395 --> 01:05:43,773
What I'm saying is,
let's save our auction chips.

1341
01:05:43,856 --> 01:05:45,691
It's all meaningful
to get these leftovers.

1342
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:46,776
For sure.

1343
01:05:46,859 --> 01:05:50,071
It doesn't really matter
what order we get in Round 1 to 3.

1344
01:05:50,154 --> 01:05:51,948
Exploration is in Round 4.

1345
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:54,450
We could make them get some
at a high price

1346
01:05:54,533 --> 01:05:56,869
and go for the next one at a low price.

1347
01:05:56,953 --> 01:06:00,122
This requires a very complex strategy,
but anyway,

1348
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:03,000
the most important thing
is to find the right combination,

1349
01:06:03,084 --> 01:06:04,418
so just keep working on it.

1350
01:06:04,502 --> 01:06:06,253
I mean this green one is easy.

1351
01:06:06,337 --> 01:06:08,631
That's just one of these
and then one of these, right?

1352
01:06:08,714 --> 01:06:10,091
No, it's just one piece.

1353
01:06:10,174 --> 01:06:12,385
If you have this arrow, see?

1354
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:13,719
-You're right.
-Yup, just one.

1355
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:15,596
-How do you get to green?
-With just one arrow.

1356
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:16,722
-Nice.
-Which one?

1357
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:19,100
This is the key arrow,
if you have this guy.

1358
01:06:19,183 --> 01:06:20,726
And with just four goes…

1359
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:22,603
-You mean four arrows, right?
-Yes.

1360
01:06:22,687 --> 01:06:24,563
Go here with this. Okay. Then like this.

1361
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:27,650
Exactly. Yes, go down. Here, like this.

1362
01:06:27,733 --> 01:06:29,819
That one that is shaped like a C?

1363
01:06:29,902 --> 01:06:32,947
During the auction,
if we can't get this one,

1364
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:35,324
then we need to get
these two, no matter what.

1365
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:38,202
So, this one is a must-have.
One of us must get this one.

1366
01:06:38,285 --> 01:06:41,539
How do we get to the blue one?
I want to know the route to get to it.

1367
01:06:41,622 --> 01:06:43,374
We can get to it
if we lend each other a basic arrow.

1368
01:06:43,457 --> 01:06:45,042
It won't work even with a basic arrow.

1369
01:06:45,126 --> 01:06:47,920
It does, like this and like…

1370
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:50,172
No, that's putting it like this.

1371
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:52,341
-Then, these two overlap.
-Oh, it doesn't reach.

1372
01:06:52,425 --> 01:06:54,260
There's a reason that's worth a lot.

1373
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:56,178
Has anyone figured out the blue one?

1374
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:59,306
-I'm trying right now.
-The blue one is tricky.

1375
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:00,683
So-hui will find it for us.

1376
01:07:01,475 --> 01:07:03,019
-Your time is up.
-Oh, no!

1377
01:07:04,562 --> 01:07:06,856
Everyone, please gather in the hall.

1378
01:07:06,939 --> 01:07:09,275
-Here's your starting arrow.
-Thank you.

1379
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:10,818
-Kyuhyun.
-Thank you.

1380
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:17,992
It's still much better.

1381
01:07:18,075 --> 01:07:19,243
This one like that.

1382
01:07:19,326 --> 01:07:22,955
The arrow auction of Round 1
will now begin.

1383
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:25,708
We have to get hold of this twisty one,
no matter what.

1384
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:27,334
Within these three turns.

1385
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:29,003
Yes, we need that one.

1386
01:07:29,086 --> 01:07:32,339
Kang Ji-yeong,
please enter the auction booth.

1387
01:07:32,423 --> 01:07:34,091
Since we only have four people,

1388
01:07:34,175 --> 01:07:37,094
we have to save a lot for
when we concentrate our firepower.

1389
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:39,972
Bid three for now.
Let's not be greedy in the beginning.

1390
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:42,224
-Because at this stage… Yes.
-Okay, three?

1391
01:07:43,768 --> 01:07:44,852
Hello.

1392
01:07:46,729 --> 01:07:47,605
Is that three?

1393
01:07:47,688 --> 01:07:48,564
Yes, three.

1394
01:07:48,647 --> 01:07:50,316
Kang Ji-yeong, you have bid three.

1395
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:53,110
-It's absolutely massive.
-What?

1396
01:07:53,194 --> 01:07:55,821
Does this actually fit anywhere?
It gets blocked by the fences.

1397
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:57,448
Right.

1398
01:07:57,531 --> 01:07:59,784
-How do we use it?
-I feel like I'm taking an exam.

1399
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:02,661
-I found the orange one.
-Let's go. What have you got?

1400
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:05,039
-Two basic arrows are enough.
-Two basic ones?

1401
01:08:05,122 --> 01:08:07,708
One, two. One, two, three, four.

1402
01:08:07,792 --> 01:08:10,086
One, two, three. One…

1403
01:08:10,169 --> 01:08:12,505
Yup. You can get to orange with this.

1404
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:15,049
-This big one doesn't fit. This one.
-Which one?

1405
01:08:15,132 --> 01:08:18,010
I couldn't figure it out.
Why did they even give it to us?

1406
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:19,970
-It can't be there for no reason.
-Really?

1407
01:08:20,054 --> 01:08:23,516
Exactly, it must
be necessary for something.

1408
01:08:23,599 --> 01:08:26,560
-Exactly. This one doesn't make sense.
-It fits in here.

1409
01:08:26,644 --> 01:08:27,478
-Where?
-Where?

1410
01:08:27,561 --> 01:08:30,106
One, two, three, four, five.
Oh, you're right.

1411
01:08:30,189 --> 01:08:31,774
Yeah, it does fit.

1412
01:08:31,857 --> 01:08:33,984
Perfect. Then you can
get to white in two goes.

1413
01:08:34,568 --> 01:08:36,821
That's it. You can get to white in two.

1414
01:08:36,904 --> 01:08:37,947
Really? If you do this?

1415
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:39,990
One, two. One, two, three, four.

1416
01:08:40,074 --> 01:08:41,659
One, two, three. One, two.

1417
01:08:41,742 --> 01:08:42,868
Amazing, right?

1418
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:44,537
So-hui's a genius.

1419
01:08:45,287 --> 01:08:46,413
-So-hui's the best!
-Indeed!

1420
01:08:46,497 --> 01:08:48,040
I knew the KAIST graduate could do it.

1421
01:08:51,043 --> 01:08:52,002
Is anyone in here?

1422
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:54,046
Oh, there you are.

1423
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:55,673
I'm here.

1424
01:08:57,007 --> 01:08:59,969
Kyuhyun, how many chips
would you like to bid?

1425
01:09:00,052 --> 01:09:01,470
I will bid one.

1426
01:09:01,554 --> 01:09:02,847
I will bid one.

1427
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:04,014
I will bid two.

1428
01:09:04,098 --> 01:09:05,891
Son Eun-yu, you have bid two.

1429
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:07,518
I will bid one.

1430
01:09:07,601 --> 01:09:09,103
Please put one chip in.

1431
01:09:09,186 --> 01:09:11,147
-One.
-I will bid one.

1432
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:12,273
I will bid one.

1433
01:09:12,356 --> 01:09:13,941
Yes, please put one chip in.

1434
01:09:14,024 --> 01:09:16,735
Jeong Hyun-gyu, how many chips
would you like to bid?

1435
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:17,653
Two.

1436
01:09:18,237 --> 01:09:20,197
-I have something to ask.
-Yes?

1437
01:09:20,281 --> 01:09:22,116
Can we go over these fences

1438
01:09:22,199 --> 01:09:24,785
as long as our arrow
starts and ends on a red dot?

1439
01:09:24,869 --> 01:09:28,622
Each arrow must
start and end on a red dot.

1440
01:09:28,706 --> 01:09:29,540
Okay.

1441
01:09:29,623 --> 01:09:32,501
Here are the results of the arrow auction.

1442
01:09:33,002 --> 01:09:34,003
You're number one?

1443
01:09:34,753 --> 01:09:35,838
I knew this would happen.

1444
01:09:35,921 --> 01:09:38,090
-Just one?
-I think everyone just bid one.

1445
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:40,968
Please take your arrows in order.

1446
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:43,429
-Hang on, is this right?
-Yes, that one.

1447
01:09:43,512 --> 01:09:45,389
-Kang Ji-yeong, is this correct?
-Yes, this is right.

1448
01:09:45,472 --> 01:09:47,141
-Just a moment.
-Let me affix a nametag.

1449
01:09:47,808 --> 01:09:49,602
She's taking that one. Damn.

1450
01:09:49,685 --> 01:09:50,853
Shit.

1451
01:09:51,604 --> 01:09:52,938
Of course she figured it out.

1452
01:09:53,606 --> 01:09:56,400
-Jeong Hyun-gyu, please select your arrow.
-Okay.

1453
01:09:59,111 --> 01:10:00,154
Thank you.

1454
01:10:02,114 --> 01:10:02,948
Son Eun-yu.

1455
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:05,618
-I will take this one.
-Yes, let me affix a nametag.

1456
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:09,997
I think they're going after the pink one.

1457
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:12,708
Because, look. It's one, two, three.

1458
01:10:12,791 --> 01:10:16,837
From here. If they just get this one,
they can get pink right away.

1459
01:10:16,921 --> 01:10:19,089
-That one? Then I'll take it.
-Shall we get all of those?

1460
01:10:19,173 --> 01:10:20,549
I'll take the 7-shaped one.

1461
01:10:20,633 --> 01:10:22,885
Shall we monopolize them for now?

1462
01:10:22,968 --> 01:10:23,928
Choi Hyun-joon.

1463
01:10:25,596 --> 01:10:26,680
I'll take this one.

1464
01:10:27,181 --> 01:10:28,432
Thank you.

1465
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:31,977
I'll take this one.

1466
01:10:32,645 --> 01:10:36,190
"Did you really have to take all those?"

1467
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:41,403
I'm so pissed. We all bid one chip,
so did you really have to take all those?

1468
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:42,529
Yes!

1469
01:10:43,781 --> 01:10:46,575
But if one of these is left, what happens?

1470
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:48,786
-It'll be scrapped.
-Is it just scrapped?

1471
01:10:48,869 --> 01:10:50,246
-Justin Min.
-Yes.

1472
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:55,334
The arrow auction of Round 1
has concluded.

1473
01:10:56,001 --> 01:10:59,088
The arrow auction of Round 2
will now begin.

1474
01:10:59,171 --> 01:11:00,256
Again? Right away?

1475
01:11:00,339 --> 01:11:01,840
We need to put some in this time.

1476
01:11:01,924 --> 01:11:04,635
Choi Hyun-joon, how many chips
would you like to bid?

1477
01:11:04,718 --> 01:11:06,679
Well, I will…

1478
01:11:06,762 --> 01:11:08,305
I will bid four.

1479
01:11:08,389 --> 01:11:09,682
I will bid eight.

1480
01:11:09,765 --> 01:11:11,100
I will bid three.

1481
01:11:11,183 --> 01:11:12,643
I will bid four.

1482
01:11:12,726 --> 01:11:14,103
Okay, you have bid four.

1483
01:11:14,186 --> 01:11:17,690
Can you guys listen to me
and see if it makes sense?

1484
01:11:17,773 --> 01:11:19,692
I asked if we could go over the fences.

1485
01:11:20,234 --> 01:11:22,653
He replied it must go
from red dot to red dot.

1486
01:11:22,736 --> 01:11:24,738
I think the fences and walls are all fake.

1487
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:26,448
I was just thinking the same.

1488
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:29,201
I think we need to
think outside the box here.

1489
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:31,495
Exactly. I think that's good.
I think you're right.

1490
01:11:31,578 --> 01:11:34,707
Well, that's very persuasive,

1491
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:37,084
because if we get all of these,
we have a lot of options.

1492
01:11:37,167 --> 01:11:39,712
If we can really go over the fences

1493
01:11:39,795 --> 01:11:41,755
and if we just secure these two,

1494
01:11:41,839 --> 01:11:44,591
we can get all of these before they do.

1495
01:11:44,675 --> 01:11:46,635
-This… Of course.
-The yellow one too?

1496
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:48,887
-It's like a knight chess piece.
-Oh, since it reaches here.

1497
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:50,889
We can just go here
with this knight arrow.

1498
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:52,182
So the knight is crucial.

1499
01:11:52,266 --> 01:11:54,226
It's really important throughout the game,

1500
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:57,438
so let's throw a
decisive blow here and scoff…

1501
01:11:57,521 --> 01:11:58,731
-"Eat."
-Eat them all.

1502
01:11:58,814 --> 01:12:00,566
But what about those that come after…

1503
01:12:00,649 --> 01:12:01,650
Justin Min.

1504
01:12:01,734 --> 01:12:02,651
Son Eun-yu.

1505
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:04,069
7high.

1506
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:05,571
Kang Ji-yeong.

1507
01:12:05,654 --> 01:12:07,906
How many chips would you like to bid?

1508
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:09,450
I will go for seven.

1509
01:12:09,533 --> 01:12:11,493
Hey, this knight is really difficult.

1510
01:12:11,577 --> 01:12:15,122
It makes no sense. I mean,
if it faced the other way, it'd work.

1511
01:12:15,205 --> 01:12:16,582
Then shall we give up the knight?

1512
01:12:16,665 --> 01:12:19,293
But since it's there,
there must be a way to use it.

1513
01:12:19,376 --> 01:12:21,003
I found the blue one.

1514
01:12:21,587 --> 01:12:23,714
-But you have to go a really long way.
-Really?

1515
01:12:23,797 --> 01:12:24,840
How many times?

1516
01:12:24,923 --> 01:12:27,134
-Four? Hang on, like this.
-Four is fine.

1517
01:12:27,217 --> 01:12:29,053
You go like this.

1518
01:12:29,136 --> 01:12:30,471
Okay, did we use this?

1519
01:12:30,554 --> 01:12:32,890
-Yeah, then you go like this…
-Like this?

1520
01:12:32,973 --> 01:12:34,183
…like this, like this.

1521
01:12:34,266 --> 01:12:36,226
Nice. Two L-shapes. Nice.

1522
01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:37,519
Genius.

1523
01:12:37,603 --> 01:12:38,854
-This…
-I knew it.

1524
01:12:38,937 --> 01:12:40,439
We must get this one.

1525
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:41,357
Which number is it?

1526
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:42,524
Then I'll bid a lot.

1527
01:12:43,067 --> 01:12:46,570
Kyuhyun, how many chips
would you like to bid?

1528
01:12:48,614 --> 01:12:49,823
I think it's overkill.

1529
01:12:50,616 --> 01:12:54,161
Considering there are
three rounds still left,

1530
01:12:54,244 --> 01:12:56,080
I can bid up to 16, right?

1531
01:12:57,456 --> 01:13:00,584
So that's… 16.

1532
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:02,503
Seems like overkill.

1533
01:13:07,883 --> 01:13:10,135
Why now… Hey, Hyun-joon. Damn.

1534
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:12,221
Isn't it number seven
in the second auction?

1535
01:13:12,304 --> 01:13:13,138
-Yes.
-Yes.

1536
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:16,392
You can get two of them as
a special set in the third auction.

1537
01:13:16,475 --> 01:13:17,434
You're right.

1538
01:13:17,518 --> 01:13:20,604
It'd be better to get two then
than going all in on this. Damn.

1539
01:13:21,188 --> 01:13:22,648
Because we need that after this.

1540
01:13:22,731 --> 01:13:25,275
-Yes, after the third one.
-Can't we tell him now?

1541
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:27,528
I really hope he hasn't bid 15 right now.

1542
01:13:27,611 --> 01:13:28,904
I hope he only bid ten.

1543
01:13:28,987 --> 01:13:30,572
I will bid 16.

1544
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:35,202
-Please go back to the hall.
-Thank you.

1545
01:13:36,036 --> 01:13:37,579
Oh, please, no.

1546
01:13:37,663 --> 01:13:39,123
Kyuhyun, you only bid ten, right?

1547
01:13:39,206 --> 01:13:40,207
Why?

1548
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:42,292
How many did you bid?

1549
01:13:42,376 --> 01:13:43,502
-Why do you ask?
-Please.

1550
01:13:43,585 --> 01:13:45,546
I thought about it
and then put them all in.

1551
01:13:45,629 --> 01:13:46,588
Good job.

1552
01:13:46,672 --> 01:13:48,298
-What is it?
-We can still make it up.

1553
01:13:48,382 --> 01:13:50,008
Here, they give two of them here.

1554
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:52,511
Damn it. Hey, this…

1555
01:13:54,054 --> 01:13:57,349
Here are the results of the arrow auction.

1556
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:58,475
BIDDING ORDER

1557
01:13:58,559 --> 01:14:01,854
Gosh, they've used even more.
Seven wasn't safe enough.

1558
01:14:01,937 --> 01:14:03,313
I used seven.

1559
01:14:03,397 --> 01:14:06,108
Please take your arrows in order.

1560
01:14:06,650 --> 01:14:07,693
I will take this one.

1561
01:14:07,776 --> 01:14:08,986
-This one?
-Yes.

1562
01:14:11,989 --> 01:14:14,032
Jeong Hyun-gyu, please select your arrow.

1563
01:14:17,244 --> 01:14:18,328
We've lost all of them.

1564
01:14:18,412 --> 01:14:20,706
God, we're screwed.
We should have bid more.

1565
01:14:20,789 --> 01:14:22,708
-One more would've been enough, right?
-No.

1566
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:24,334
I think a lot more than that.

1567
01:14:24,418 --> 01:14:27,463
I'm so annoyed.
I wasn't planning to use that many.

1568
01:14:28,338 --> 01:14:30,048
Oh, they've really bet a lot.

1569
01:14:30,549 --> 01:14:32,134
I'll take this one.

1570
01:14:32,217 --> 01:14:33,677
I'll take this one.

1571
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:35,721
I'll take this one, please.

1572
01:14:35,804 --> 01:14:37,306
I'll take this one. Oh, right.

1573
01:14:39,975 --> 01:14:41,977
Then I can take the long one?

1574
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:43,187
You want the long one?

1575
01:14:43,270 --> 01:14:44,354
Yeah.

1576
01:14:44,938 --> 01:14:46,523
I'm all about gambling anyway.

1577
01:14:47,024 --> 01:14:50,402
The arrow auction of Round 2
has concluded.

1578
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:54,031
The arrow auction of Round 3
will now begin.

1579
01:14:58,535 --> 01:15:00,537
Has everyone decided on their targets?

1580
01:15:00,621 --> 01:15:03,665
One person can go for yellow and green.
I'll go for pink.

1581
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:06,460
Green doesn't matter anyway.
The order doesn't matter for it.

1582
01:15:06,543 --> 01:15:08,712
So yellow first. Who'll get it?

1583
01:15:08,795 --> 01:15:11,215
-Hyun-joon? Kyuhyun, okay, okay.
-No, it should be him.

1584
01:15:11,298 --> 01:15:12,716
-I'm white.
-Yes.

1585
01:15:12,799 --> 01:15:14,968
Then So-hui can go for blue.

1586
01:15:15,052 --> 01:15:17,554
I can't see a route to orange.
I want to try for orange.

1587
01:15:17,638 --> 01:15:20,349
I can't figure out
orange or purple. Or this one.

1588
01:15:20,432 --> 01:15:22,309
Hang on, then we're securing these clues.

1589
01:15:22,392 --> 01:15:24,269
One, two, three.

1590
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:25,771
-Justin will get this one.
-Yeah.

1591
01:15:25,854 --> 01:15:27,773
-What are you going for?
-I'm going for this one.

1592
01:15:27,856 --> 01:15:28,982
-Pink?
-Yes.

1593
01:15:29,066 --> 01:15:31,568
I can get this one too.
Pick one for me to get.

1594
01:15:31,652 --> 01:15:35,531
Can you tell me this one?
Do I get this blue one using the knight?

1595
01:15:35,614 --> 01:15:37,616
But we must get this in the next round.

1596
01:15:37,699 --> 01:15:38,825
Will you go all in on this?

1597
01:15:38,909 --> 01:15:39,952
-Which one?
-This one.

1598
01:15:40,035 --> 01:15:41,537
Are you bidding 13?

1599
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:43,539
Yes, I'm going all in with 13.

1600
01:15:43,622 --> 01:15:45,832
-Who's next?
-Everyone else's done here.

1601
01:15:45,916 --> 01:15:47,459
You go all in, except for two.

1602
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:49,378
-Then it's So-hui after that.
-All in except for two.

1603
01:15:49,461 --> 01:15:53,340
Two, four, six, eight, ten, twelve.

1604
01:15:53,423 --> 01:15:54,883
I will bid a total of 14.

1605
01:15:57,302 --> 01:15:58,595
Son Eun-yu.

1606
01:15:58,679 --> 01:15:59,805
Justin Min.

1607
01:15:59,888 --> 01:16:02,391
How many chips would you like to bid?

1608
01:16:02,474 --> 01:16:05,644
Here are the results of the arrow auction.

1609
01:16:06,144 --> 01:16:09,273
BIDDING ORDER

1610
01:16:09,356 --> 01:16:12,025
7high, please select your arrow.

1611
01:16:14,987 --> 01:16:16,238
Wow, what the heck?

1612
01:16:16,321 --> 01:16:17,614
They've gone all in.

1613
01:16:17,698 --> 01:16:19,241
None of them have bid one.

1614
01:16:19,324 --> 01:16:22,202
They've all bid at least one or two
so they have 17 at most.

1615
01:16:24,621 --> 01:16:26,456
Making a winning move in the third round?

1616
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:29,960
If it fails, we'll just stand back
and watch the screen again.

1617
01:16:30,043 --> 01:16:31,461
-It can't be helped, okay?
-Got it.

1618
01:16:31,545 --> 01:16:32,379
Let's go.

1619
01:16:33,964 --> 01:16:36,300
7high, how many chips
would you like to bid?

1620
01:16:36,383 --> 01:16:37,801
I will bid 17.

1621
01:16:37,884 --> 01:16:39,720
Yes, please put 17 chips in.

1622
01:16:39,803 --> 01:16:41,263
I will bid all 17.

1623
01:16:41,346 --> 01:16:43,140
Please put 17 chips in.

1624
01:16:43,223 --> 01:16:44,933
Yes, you have 17 left.

1625
01:16:45,017 --> 01:16:45,892
I'll bid all of them.

1626
01:16:45,976 --> 01:16:48,729
-They're giving up the remaining auctions.
-You're right.

1627
01:16:49,896 --> 01:16:50,731
Damn it.

1628
01:16:52,357 --> 01:16:53,525
-Are you choosing that one?
-Yes.

1629
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:55,736
-That's what we missed earlier.
-Damn, they know.

1630
01:17:01,825 --> 01:17:02,951
This one.

1631
01:17:03,035 --> 01:17:04,411
Let me affix a nametag.

1632
01:17:04,995 --> 01:17:08,457
Can we stand in line?
Can we stand in line for Round 4?

1633
01:17:08,540 --> 01:17:09,416
You may stand here.

1634
01:17:11,043 --> 01:17:12,294
-Are you standing in line?
-Yes.

1635
01:17:13,879 --> 01:17:15,672
Kyuhyun, you need to get your arrow. Move.

1636
01:17:15,756 --> 01:17:16,590
I have them.

1637
01:17:17,674 --> 01:17:19,301
What? Despite your order?

1638
01:17:19,384 --> 01:17:21,678
-It does matter. Go get it.
-You have to get it.

1639
01:17:21,762 --> 01:17:24,973
You haven't fetched your arrow yet.
The one for this round.

1640
01:17:25,057 --> 01:17:27,559
-I'm going second.
-We paid for this position as well.

1641
01:17:29,728 --> 01:17:31,104
Or buy this spot with chips.

1642
01:17:31,188 --> 01:17:32,314
We're screwed.

1643
01:17:32,397 --> 01:17:33,940
You can only stand in line after this.

1644
01:17:35,233 --> 01:17:39,571
For Round 4, the exploration round,
entry is first-come-first-served,

1645
01:17:39,655 --> 01:17:44,534
but you can't line up before collecting
your arrow from the third auction.

1646
01:17:44,618 --> 01:17:45,827
As 7high noted,

1647
01:17:45,911 --> 01:17:49,373
it seems the auction of Round 3
also decides the order

1648
01:17:49,456 --> 01:17:51,375
for exploration in Round 4.

1649
01:17:51,458 --> 01:17:53,877
So we get this with the knight, right?
Damn it.

1650
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:56,171
-Just take it. What's with you?
-Give me a minute.

1651
01:17:56,254 --> 01:17:58,465
Hey, let's come from behind.
Let's do this.

1652
01:17:58,548 --> 01:18:00,425
-Still, this is really fun.
-Yes.

1653
01:18:00,509 --> 01:18:02,928
So amazing.
I was so impressed by So-hui.

1654
01:18:03,011 --> 01:18:04,930
The exploration of Round 4 will now begin

1655
01:18:05,013 --> 01:18:07,849
and last for the next 40 minutes.

1656
01:18:07,933 --> 01:18:12,145
Players shall enter the dealer room
and place their arrows.

1657
01:18:12,229 --> 01:18:14,606
Each player can stay in the dealer room

1658
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:17,651
for a maximum of three minutes,

1659
01:18:17,734 --> 01:18:21,613
and each player may only enter
the dealer room once during this time.

1660
01:18:21,697 --> 01:18:23,824
You have to do it in three minutes.
Can you do it?

1661
01:18:27,577 --> 01:18:30,038
7high, please begin your exploration.

1662
01:20:09,596 --> 01:20:14,601
