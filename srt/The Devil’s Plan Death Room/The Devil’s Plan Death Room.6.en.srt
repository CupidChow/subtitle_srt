1
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:11,219
Excuse me.

2
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,516
Do we have to kill people later?

3
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,476
It is possible.

4
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:25,108
I felt like I'd been hit in the head and
thought, "This is what the real game is."

5
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:27,110
"We were wrong about it all along."

6
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:30,280
Our cards look exactly the same,
including the health.

7
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:34,451
When you lose all your health,
you must be dead.

8
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,161
What are you worried about?

9
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:39,664
I've got shivers going down my spine.
I hope it isn't the case.

10
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:42,167
If we are given the choice,
should we kill two people

11
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,752
-or just one?
-We can actually stab people.

12
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:45,170
Then we'd probably only kill one.

13
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:47,213
Let's decide
whether to freeze the Clown first.

14
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:49,924
Because we'll change our strategy
based on that.

15
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:52,218
-I'll go and check quickly.
-Okay.

16
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:55,263
I don't know how they arranged
their points. Can we check?

17
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:56,806
Let's add that up.

18
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:57,807
Okay, then…

19
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,351
Have you checked
how many points the Clown has?

20
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,062
-I Don't know.
-We didn't touch it.

21
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,980
So we expect it to be either 9 or 12.

22
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,816
If no one's attacked it, it's 12.
That's why I'm asking.

23
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,027
-Didn't we hit it before?
-Did you?

24
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,571
-Right, we hit it after it was cleared.
-Without knowing So-hui had it.

25
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:12,781
Good. That's great.

26
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,866
Then you guys can go in and play 3, 3, 3.

27
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:16,242
Okay, okay.

28
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:17,827
Just in case, use the Dagger,

29
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,872
and then whoever is last to go in gets it.

30
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:22,957
Eun-yu, you need to ponder over this.

31
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,834
I'm telling you this because I trust you.

32
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:29,130
The human cards and the monster cards
look exactly the same, with health on top.

33
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:31,549
That means you can use items on people.

34
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,802
That's how their health drops
and gets eliminated.

35
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:39,140
I want to try it out
with a sneak attack on someone.

36
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:41,351
If you do,
you should just get rid of them.

37
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:42,352
I should.

38
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,938
Hyun-gyu is really dangerous.
You can't trust him.

39
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:47,816
This morning he told me
he completed the bonus round.

40
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:49,776
I did Wall Go.

41
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:51,194
You did Wall Go?

42
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:54,072
He told me he played Wall Go,
but that wasn't it.

43
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:58,201
It's actually quite dangerous for me
to be in an alliance with Hyun-gyu.

44
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,995
So, I thought I could just kill him
and pretend like I didn't,

45
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,164
then no one would know why he died.

46
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:05,166
How many points is he
going to have in this round?

47
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,127
You keep going 1, 1, 1.

48
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,087
-I'll try to keep them low.
-That way--

49
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,713
-Then attack just once.
-On Hyun-gyu?

50
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,341
Yes, attack him just once.
Or maybe I will.

51
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:15,718
You do it. Because right now,
we're following your strategy.

52
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,971
And we don't have much leeway.

53
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:20,849
We can only attack the Clown.
So you do 3 points at him.

54
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:22,100
Okay, I'll give it a go.

55
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,858
-But the Medusa…
-Then give them the Medusa,

56
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:33,278
and we can keep the Dokkaebi
for ourselves.

57
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,321
We can just do 2 and 2, and then…

58
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,489
How many points for you?

59
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,366
We should inflict
the fatal blow on the Dokkaebi.

60
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,076
We need to go last.

61
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,787
We can go 1 and 1,
and then go for the Medusa.

62
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,205
That's 44, 2, and 2?

63
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,166
I'll be 44. You two are both 2.

64
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,293
Okay.

65
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:50,503
Let's go and transfer our points.

66
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:51,921
Don't worry too much.

67
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:55,008
Yeah. But I just hope that's not it.
It'd be nice if it wasn't.

68
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:57,218
But if they do that, it would be so cruel.

69
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,595
So, so cruel.

70
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,598
-First, let's get our points transferred.
-How many was it? 40, 44…

71
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,600
What we decided was 44, 2, and 2.

72
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:07,520
But is there a specific reason
not to go with 1 and 1?

73
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:08,688
So the others can go last.

74
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:11,024
-Right, so they can get the monster.
-Okay.

75
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:14,736
I'm likely to end up back in prison,
so can I take the Dokkaebi?

76
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:17,572
-Then, 44, 2 and 2.
-Yes, 44 for me.

77
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,742
Would you like to transfer any points?

78
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:23,578
-Yes, 44, 2, 2.
-We'll split them 44, 2, 2.

79
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:25,663
-Jeong Hyun-gyu, 2…
-Yes.

80
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,207
…Choi Hyun-joon, 2,

81
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,250
Kim Ha-rin, 44, is that correct?

82
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:30,460
Yes, that's right.

83
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:31,628
Hit the Medusa.

84
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,171
Yes, the transfer is complete.

85
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:35,256
We hit the Medusa. Okay, good.

86
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,175
-How many points do they have?
-Who?

87
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:39,260
If they do 1, 1,
can they still finish top?

88
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,473
-No, they can't.
-Why not?

89
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:44,682
Can we change it?

90
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:45,642
It is possible now.

91
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:46,893
-We need to change it.
-Why?

92
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:48,978
Their points in total are less than yours.

93
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,481
-You mustn't be in first place.
-You're right.

94
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,857
They have 41 points in total.

95
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,735
After taking 1 point each for two of them,
that leaves 39.

96
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,654
You need to have 38.

97
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,949
Since we have 48 in total,
that means 38, 5, 5.

98
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,784
We'll take 38, 5, 5.

99
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:04,035
Kim Ha-rin, 38,

100
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:05,870
and 5 each for you two. Correct?

101
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:06,871
Yes.

102
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:09,749
Yes?

103
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:13,002
Are you doing okay?

104
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,672
-No idea.
-How can we be? This is just GG.

105
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:16,798
Do whatever you want.

106
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:19,384
I think he feels sorry for me.

107
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,972
-Do you have a Grenade?
-A Grenade?

108
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:25,848
I got Hyun-gyu to reduce his points to 5.

109
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,935
Why does it have to be 5?
Even 4 would have been okay.

110
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:31,938
Then you attack Hyun-gyu with me. 3, 3.

111
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,148
But then we can't get the Clown.

112
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,025
Let's just give it a go.

113
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:41,406
If we can get Hyun-gyu eliminated,
that will be good for all of us.

114
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:43,866
-That's true.
-He's too strong.

115
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,327
So let's try it. Let's give it a shot.

116
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,704
Let's do it on the next turn.

117
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,789
-For sure on the next turn?
-I'll do it for sure.

118
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:51,165
Then I'll get him to go low again.

119
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:52,667
I'll do it, no matter what.

120
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,253
Hi.

121
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:57,046
What are you guys up to?

122
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,965
What are you doing?

123
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:00,675
-No. Okay, okay.
-Yo, what are you doing?

124
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:02,969
It won't be easy
for you guys to get all four.

125
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:05,388
Many on our team already
have a lot of Pieces,

126
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:08,266
so I'm kind of cautious of them, honestly.

127
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:09,475
But you'll share them.

128
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,227
You'll share them all out, no?

129
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,605
Well… I don't know
if we'll really share them out.

130
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:17,108
-If you're in an alliance, you have to.
-Do you think?

131
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:19,319
Why are we speaking about the obvious?

132
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:22,405
Please, please, please.

133
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:59,692
You have five minutes left
for transferring points.

134
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,278
But now we're planning
to give the Medusa, right?

135
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,364
-Let's give the Dokkaebi instead.
-Right?

136
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,574
If they take the Clown,
that's 45 points in total.

137
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:09,035
So if we… Since the Medusa is certain?

138
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:11,913
-Okay. I don't mind either way.
-Deal.

139
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:14,123
So, So-hui gets the Dokkaebi?

140
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:17,627
-But with the Dokkaebi, Se-dol…
-Then we get the Medusa?

141
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,588
Okay. Then Kyuhyun goes in
and throws the Dynamite.

142
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:24,634
You'll have gone in first and
used your Dagger on the Medusa, right?

143
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,511
Right. Then throw the Grenade.

144
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,388
Then we have to
attack the Medusa before that.

145
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,430
That's at least a 6.

146
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,808
Then you'll get the Medusa.

147
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,434
-Then I'd better go later in line.
-Okay.

148
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,311
-Yes, 21, 13, 6.
-Let's go.

149
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,105
We want to change.

150
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:39,190
The transfer of points cannot be changed.

151
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:40,983
-All right.
-We can't change it anymore.

152
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,527
Then we can't use it this time.

153
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,987
-We'll do ours.
-It's not worth using a Piece on, is it?

154
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,531
No, this isn't worth a Piece.

155
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:48,866
It'd be nice to get
the Grim Reaper at the end.

156
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,326
Kyuhyun, 21 points,

157
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,121
-So-hui, 14 points.
-Yes, 14.

158
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,623
-Tinno, 6 points.
-6 points.

159
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:57,667
Ji-yeong will give 3 points to 7high,

160
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,585
and I will take the remaining 4 points.

161
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:02,672
The time for transferring points
is now up.

162
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:05,800
Here is the order of attack for Round 4.

163
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:08,594
You now have 30 minutes

164
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,055
to select your weapon and target.

165
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:13,349
Oh? Se-dol is here.

166
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,643
First attack… second and third.

167
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:17,854
Then this is where it dies.

168
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,188
Then I will freeze it.

169
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,399
Then Hyun-gyu will freeze it
and strike the final blow.

170
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:22,400
That'll leave it with 3.

171
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:24,110
It's time you stayed in the living area.

172
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:26,779
-But the living area--
-I want to go too. I've never been there.

173
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,698
-Me neither.
-We're so sad.

174
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:29,991
Can you give me the Ice?

175
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:33,870
So, let's bury the Grim Reaper, go to the
living area, and divide up the Pieces.

176
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,205
-Give her a Grenade.
-And I hit the Medusa.

177
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,000
Hey, I found something.

178
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,502
Hey, hey, this is dangerous. See here.

179
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,838
-Damn, this is crazy. Look.
-What is it?

180
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:46,924
These three here, including So-hui.

181
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,594
They'll attack the Dokkaebi or the Medusa.

182
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,679
I think they'll attack the Medusa.

183
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:54,932
If that's the case,
then the Grim Reaper will come here.

184
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:58,519
So, it's too risky to hit this.

185
00:07:58,603 --> 00:07:59,729
What are you doing?

186
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,080
The biggest problem is that

187
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,958
all three of us have to
attack the Clown to get it.

188
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,753
But if we do that,
we'll have no other moves.

189
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,087
No chance at the Grim Reaper.

190
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:29,008
The only way of getting it
is to set the Dynamite on it.

191
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,635
So we can only do 6 now.

192
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:33,971
Hang on, why are there suddenly
three people ahead of us?

193
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,973
We're going for both
the Dokkaebi and the Medusa.

194
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:38,935
-By using the Dynamite.
-We're not going to go for the Clown.

195
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,187
So that's why
you've pushed in front of us?

196
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,022
-We won't touch the Clown.
-We won't go for it.

197
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:44,941
-Seriously.
-Just give us the Grenade later.

198
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,735
You don't have to worry about that.

199
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:51,280
You have two minutes
to select your target and weapon.

200
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:55,284
It seems like either Ha-rin or Kyuhyun
is going to set the Dynamite.

201
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,579
When monster 2 or 3 drops,
the Grim Reaper will come out.

202
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,206
What do you think they'll kill first?

203
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:02,083
Let's hit the Clown twice
and use the Dynamite.

204
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,251
What if we can't get the Clown?

205
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:04,627
Can't we…

206
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,754
-Have you all done yours?
-Not yet.

207
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:09,257
-Only two minutes left. Hurry up.
-Really?

208
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:12,093
Hey, I just…

209
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:13,761
I just saved your butts.

210
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:16,097
These people need someone to manage them.

211
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,598
I will use my Dagger on No. 1.

212
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:20,059
I will use my Dagger on No. 1.

213
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:22,520
-Dagger on Battlefield No. 1.
-Yes.

214
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:24,063
Should we attack No. 2 or 3?

215
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:26,649
What is there to gain?
We can't get it anyhow.

216
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,693
What are they agonizing over?

217
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:32,363
I don't think they believe
that we're not going for the Clown.

218
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:34,156
Though we're really not.

219
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,909
But we have to try.
There's no other play we can make.

220
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,537
So just choose between 2 and 3,
and go for it. Quickly.

221
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,872
Please let me know your weapon and target.

222
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,124
DYNAMITE

223
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,458
No. 3, please.

224
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:47,295
-The Dynamite on Battlefield No. 3?
-Yes.

225
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,297
Your time is up.

226
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,966
Everybody, please gather in the hall.

227
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:56,220
Here are the results of
all attacks being applied in order.

228
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,306
The Dokkaebi on Battlefield No. 2…

229
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,810
was killed by Kyuhyun.

230
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:03,894
-What?
-Kyuhyun.

231
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:06,606
But So-hui…

232
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:07,732
You are awarded 18 points,

233
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:10,860
-a Piece, and the Grenade.
-What's going on? I got it?

234
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,987
The Clown in Battlefield No. 1…

235
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:18,826
was killed by Justin Min.

236
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:19,785
What?

237
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:21,662
How?

238
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:25,416
You are awarded 12 points
and two Grenades.

239
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,209
What the heck?

240
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,671
I will attack No. 3 with my Dagger.

241
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,673
I will use the Dynamite
on Battlefield No. 2.

242
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:35,217
I will use the Grenade
on Battlefield No. 2.

243
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,886
I will use my Dagger on No. 1.

244
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:37,845
No. 3, please.

245
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:39,639
I will use my Dagger on No. 1.

246
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,891
I'll use my Dagger on No. 1.

247
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,435
-The Dagger on Battlefield No. 1.
-Yes.

248
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:46,062
That was a good move.

249
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,856
Se-dol, we might survive just yet.

250
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,031
On Battlefield No. 10,

251
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:58,699
Lee Se-dol has been

252
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,077
killed by Choi Hyun-joon.

253
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,536
On Battlefield No. 10,

254
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:06,957
Lee Se-dol has been
killed by Choi Hyun-joon.

255
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,418
What… what just happened?

256
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:30,564
THE DEVIL'S PLAN
DEATH ROOM

257
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,650
What… what just happened?

258
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:34,944
How is that possible?

259
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:42,785
The Pieces and special weapon cards
held by Lee Se-dol

260
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,745
will be awarded to Choi Hyun-joon as loot.

261
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:45,705
What…

262
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:48,916
Lee Se-dol, please
hand in your Pieces and cards.

263
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,963
I messed up.

264
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,005
Dude!

265
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:58,676
30 MINUTES EARLIER

266
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:03,055
Hey, I found something.

267
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,433
Hey, hey, this is dangerous. See here.

268
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,351
Damn, this is crazy. Look.

269
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:09,729
Where is it?

270
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,731
"The battlefield
is marked with a double solid line."

271
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:14,859
The battlefield is marked
with a double solid line…

272
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,444
These two are battlefields.

273
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,028
It's marked with solid lines.

274
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,197
There are solid lines here,
but they're also here.

275
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:23,701
That means, if we attack here, he dies.

276
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,162
Wow, damn, this is insane.

277
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,664
-So, if we attack No. 10 or 11, they die?
-That's nuts.

278
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,835
Players may only attack targets
on the battlefield,

279
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,671
and the battlefield is marked
with double solid lines.

280
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:41,051
Thus, the last two spaces in the order of
play are actually additional battlefields,

281
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:44,263
and if players attack them
for the amount of victory points

282
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:46,015
indicated next to the heart,

283
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:50,352
they can take all the Pieces
and weapons that that player has.

284
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:55,316
That means from Round 1 until now,
all the players in positions 10 and 11

285
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:58,235
could have been killed
with one thrust of a Dagger.

286
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:01,614
At first,
I thought you could kill any player.

287
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:04,492
But when Tinno said the double solid lines
signify the battlefield,

288
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:07,077
I thought,
"Then I'm in grave danger right now,"

289
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,370
because I was in last place.

290
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:11,707
So from then on, I started
thinking what to do, and luckily…

291
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,375
Want to try attacking Se-dol?

292
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,418
Hey.

293
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,470
I will use my Dagger
on Battlefield No. 10.

294
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:28,015
I will attack Lee Se-dol
on Battlefield No. 10

295
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:29,600
with my Dagger.

296
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,852
Choi Hyun-joon, here is your loot.

297
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:34,980
I have given you two Pieces.

298
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,442
Wow, I've got goosebumps.

299
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:42,905
Lee Se-dol has lost all his Pieces.

300
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,032
Consequently, Lee Se-dol

301
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:48,619
becomes the fourth player
eliminated from The Devil's Plan.

302
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:51,831
-Thanks for everything. Well played.
-You've been through a lot.

303
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:55,167
Lee Se-dol,
please leave this place immediately.

304
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,961
-Well played.
-Well played.

305
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:59,004
I'm so sorry.

306
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,840
-Gosh.
-I really am.

307
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:02,716
Keep it up.

308
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,097
You played so well.

309
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,849
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

310
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,144
Well, to be honest, I feel relieved.

311
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:16,397
I came to gain experience
and enjoy the game,

312
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,358
and I think I'm going home
with a lot of good memories.

313
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:20,693
The only regret I have is

314
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:23,821
that I didn't get to try the hidden stage.

315
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:26,282
Even if I were to fail, I wanted to.

316
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:30,327
I regret that I didn't say,
"Oh, I will definitely go."

317
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:31,745
That's my one regret.

318
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:32,872
Thank you.

319
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:39,503
I'm very upset

320
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,839
that Se-dol has been eliminated,

321
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:45,301
and I'm sorry that I wasn't good enough.

322
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,972
Round 5 will now begin.

323
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,688
They already knew
if they did that intentionally.

324
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:00,024
Darn it, what use is all this?

325
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,817
But who attacked Se-dol?

326
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,068
-Hyun-joon.
-Hyun-joon.

327
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:05,988
Hyun-joon took out Se-dol?

328
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,490
Yes. That's why five points
went to Hyun-joon.

329
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,868
Wait, Hyun-joon took out Se-dol?

330
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:11,785
Yeah.

331
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,748
Right now, I'm a little…

332
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:18,584
We need to use a Piece
to get the two Pieces on the Grim Reaper.

333
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:22,212
It's better to use a Piece
to secure turns 1, 2, 3,

334
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:23,672
then kill the Grim Reaper.

335
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,258
Isn't that the right thing to do?

336
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,218
I'm just so sorry about Se-dol.

337
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,348
Justin, are you enjoying the game?

338
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,891
I don't think he is now.

339
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:41,023
So, four's going to prison tonight?
Is it five?

340
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:41,982
Five.

341
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,609
Probably the lowest five.

342
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,362
But they are also in a dilemma right now.

343
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,280
They played together
as two teams of three.

344
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:49,406
One will end up in prison.

345
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,908
-You're right.
-Which is a good thing.

346
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:53,077
There will be five
in the living area today.

347
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,708
I have to get the Grim Reaper
so I don't end up back in prison.

348
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,336
-That's why I want to get it.
-Okay, you take it.

349
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:03,921
Then on his next turn,

350
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,756
if Kyuhyun throws his Dynamite, it's done.

351
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,800
We don't know how many points
the Grim Reaper has left.

352
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:09,677
We have to try and calculate it.

353
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,136
Did any of them hit it?

354
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:16,767
Can you tell me how many of you
hit the Grim Reaper? From your team?

355
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:20,062
-Sorry?
-Did you hit the Grim Reaper?

356
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,897
Didn't you attack the Grim Reaper?

357
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,315
I don't know.

358
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:33,784
Didn't she spend time
in the prison block with Se-dol?

359
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:38,956
But she's walking around asking that
when Se-dol's only just gone?

360
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,791
-Does that fit this mood right now?
-Ha-rin?

361
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,626
-Ha-rin?
-I don't get it.

362
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,587
They wouldn't tell me
what they used on the Grim Reaper.

363
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:46,547
We'll just use a Piece.

364
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:49,091
So let's just use one of our Pieces.

365
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,010
Since So-hui went third,
they might've hit it.

366
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,220
-Yes, they might have.
-Or we can use the Scout.

367
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:58,058
Hang on, I should purchase the Scout.
I have an extra Piece.

368
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,476
Why would you do that?

369
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,437
You don't need to use your Piece. Keep it.

370
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,982
In any case, if we let them win,
you two are safe.

371
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:08,819
Yes. In any case, I'll go with 7high.

372
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:10,988
Of course, since five of us
have to go to jail,

373
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:13,449
we had to let Hyun-joon choose.

374
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:17,202
I realized that one of Kyuhyun,
me, and So-hui had to go to jail,

375
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,038
and since 7high was already going,

376
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,749
I thought it was only right
for me to go with him.

377
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:24,001
The 9-person fiasco earlier as well.

378
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:26,336
I feel responsible for that.
So it's only right.

379
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,298
No, I think you had a really tough time
mediating in the middle.

380
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,550
Exactly. I was just thinking that.

381
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,719
We would like to use the Scout.

382
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:35,095
Please give me one Piece.

383
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:37,848
-Would you like to use it now?
-Yes.

384
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:39,099
What are we going to do?

385
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,684
Do we just stick with it?

386
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,603
Shouldn't we just use all of them?

387
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,354
You have some special weapons cards?

388
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,523
Yes, I have the Dual Swords. I'll use it.

389
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,859
We were saving that
to use on the Grim Reaper.

390
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:51,111
-I even set the Dynamite.
-Exactly.

391
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:53,947
I'm actually quite angry. Aren't you?

392
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,908
7high, shall we make Justin finish first?

393
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,160
Is that possible?

394
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,537
It's possible,
if we muck things up for them.

395
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,581
They have to be at least 66 points.

396
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:06,460
The cards have 14 and 6 left.

397
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:09,338
-Then our calculation was right?
-They're 14 and 6.

398
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,216
When our points are divided by 3,
Justin ends up finishing first.

399
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,634
-So…
-Really?

400
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:16,428
Justin gets all 22 points,
but we have to divide ours up.

401
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:19,765
So, if you get both cards, you'll be fine.

402
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:23,393
If we go before Justin,
we can kill the Medusa with the Grenade,

403
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,521
then Kyuhyun's Dynamite goes off
and he hits it once.

404
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,981
Ha-rin comes in with the Dual Swords
to finish it off.

405
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:31,360
But if Justin throws the Grenade
at the Grim Reaper,

406
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:32,569
that's the worst for us.

407
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,655
Then Justin will get it, right?

408
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:37,074
That means both have to go
in front of Justin.

409
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:38,867
Then I'll change the order
and go in front.

410
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:42,329
Your team should go 27, 16, 16
with Kyuhyun being 27.

411
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:46,458
Our team will go 26, 24, and 3,

412
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:47,876
and send 3 to the front.

413
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,797
Kyuhyun 27, So-hui 16, Tinno 16.

414
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,591
We are 26, 24, and 3.

415
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:57,469
But is the order revealed
and then we make our attacks?

416
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:00,597
You can change it
when you make your attack.

417
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:01,890
The transfer is complete.

418
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,183
Okay, thank you.

419
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:06,436
But if Justin uses a Piece
to move himself to the front,

420
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,063
that would make him a legend.

421
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,190
No, he can't afford to do that.

422
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,818
-I think he'll do it.
-Why would he?

423
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:16,029
Well, you'll need to use
the Change the Order card.

424
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:20,033
That's exactly it.
I'm sure he'd risk it to get 6 Pieces.

425
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:22,369
-Yo, yo.
-Someone else?

426
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:23,954
This much is certain.

427
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:25,622
Though there isn't much we can help,

428
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:26,790
you gotta gamble right now.

429
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:28,876
You just randomly go somewhere

430
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:31,378
in the order on a turn
they thought they'd have

431
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:32,963
and throw your Dynamite.

432
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:34,798
Kill it? Good. If not? So be it.

433
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:37,134
-That's true. That's what I've been doing.
-Right, think about it.

434
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:40,012
You have five minutes left
for transferring points.

435
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:42,222
Then do we just leave our points as is?

436
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,557
Is there any way we can help?

437
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,018
Not really. Even if we help,
it's not certain.

438
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:48,061
If we make it obvious we're messing it up,

439
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:49,521
they'll just play it safe.

440
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:50,647
-Right.
-Let's stick with it.

441
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,107
Yo. Try.

442
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,818
The time for transferring points
is now up.

443
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:58,280
Here is the order of attack for Round 5.

444
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:01,491
They didn't do it. It's exactly the same.

445
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:04,536
You now have 30 minutes

446
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,496
-to go to the dealer room…
-Do I have to buy that now?

447
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,123
Now. Quickly.

448
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,166
-And then what?
-Hurry.

449
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,925
You go first and attack the Medusa.

450
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:22,346
I'd like to change the order.

451
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,681
-Do you want to purchase a special item?
-Yes, yes.

452
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,266
Please give me one Piece.

453
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:28,435
Hyun-joon, go in and do it.

454
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:30,354
Can I go? Did you do it?

455
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:31,480
Just a moment.

456
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,608
-What position would you like to move to?
-First.

457
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:37,361
Please tell me the target you'd like to
attack and present your weapon.

458
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,696
But I need my card.

459
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,323
-Didn't you bring it with you?
-No.

460
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:44,326
Hyun-joon took it, right? The item.

461
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,286
-Yeah.
-Hey, did you bring that thing?

462
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,789
-Did you bring the item?
-Yeah, yeah.

463
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,796
Please choose your target and weapon.

464
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:58,257
I would like to use a Piece
to move myself up to first.

465
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:03,762
I will go for Battlefield No. 2.

466
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:05,806
Even though I can't win it,
I stabbed the Grim Reaper.

467
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,474
Me too, I'm going to go for it too.

468
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,184
There's no point in saving this.

469
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:12,271
I will use my Dagger on No. 3

470
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,897
where I set the Dynamite earlier.

471
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:16,275
-Your Dagger on Battlefield No. 3?
-Yep.

472
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,360
Your time is up.

473
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,779
Everyone, please gather in the hall.

474
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:27,661
Here are the results of
all attacks being applied in order.

475
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:30,289
Change the Order had been used.

476
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:33,667
Here is updated order of attack.

477
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,294
-What the heck?
-Huh?

478
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:38,297
Justin Min has moved up to second.

479
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,757
-Oh, you're right. What the heck?
-He moved up.

480
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,135
Here are the results of attacks
applied in the new order.

481
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,888
The Grim Reaper on Battlefield No. 2…

482
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,181
Go!

483
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:51,476
…was killed by Kyuhyun.

484
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,228
-Me? Why?
-Darn, I'm back to jail.

485
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:56,606
-You are awarded 20 points and 2 Pieces.
-Because Justin moved up.

486
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:57,607
What the heck?

487
00:21:57,691 --> 00:22:00,110
-Exactly, I'm back to jail.
-What happened?

488
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:02,112
The Medusa on Battlefield No. 3…

489
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:07,034
was killed by 7high.

490
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:07,951
What the heck?

491
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:11,538
-You are awarded 15 points and one Piece.
-It was killed by 7high?

492
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:13,582
How did 7high end up with it?

493
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:14,875
Oh, my God.

494
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:18,545
Here are the final points for each player.

495
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:20,589
KYUHYUN, SO-HUI, TINNO
26.3

496
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,466
Players with the highest score,

497
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:23,633
Kyuhyun,

498
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,010
Yoon So-hui,

499
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:26,553
and Tinno,

500
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:28,388
are awarded two Pieces each.

501
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:30,182
Here is your reward.

502
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:32,100
But this time,
I didn't attack the Grim Reaper.

503
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,560
Did we get our calculations wrong?

504
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,270
No, but we should've gotten the Medusa.

505
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,689
Did you use the Dynamite
instead of the Grenade?

506
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:38,815
I gave you the Grenade.

507
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:41,610
-That's what I used.
-That must be it. Or it doesn't add up.

508
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,904
Check your pockets. See what's left.

509
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:45,655
I don't have anything in my pockets.

510
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,449
What's going on?

511
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:50,577
Here is the order of attack for Round 4.

512
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,703
Tinno freezes it.

513
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:54,498
He freezes, then Hyun-joon and I
will attack it once each.

514
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:56,583
I would like to use the Ice
on Battlefield No. 3.

515
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,794
You have used the Ice
on Battlefield No. 3.

516
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:03,340
Lee Se-dol becomes the fourth player
eliminated from The Devil's Plan.

517
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:05,717
Round 5 will now begin.

518
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,844
I will toss a Grenade
onto Battlefield No. 3.

519
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:10,472
And I will use a Piece
to change my order to first.

520
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:14,851
I will change the order of play
and use the Grenade on the Grim Reaper.

521
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:18,105
I will attack Battlefield No. 2
with a normal attack.

522
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:20,023
I will use the Dagger on No. 3.

523
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,274
I'll go for No. 2.

524
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:24,236
I will use my Dagger on Battlefield No. 3.

525
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,946
I will attack with my Dagger.

526
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,823
-Is that on Battlefield No. 2?
-Yes, No. 2.

527
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:31,451
I will use my Dagger on No. 3
where I set the Dynamite earlier.

528
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,745
-Your Dagger on Battlefield No. 3?
-Yep.

529
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,789
Hey, Hyun-joon, I figured it out.

530
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:37,207
Tinno's Ice was still in effect.

531
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:39,668
Sweet.

532
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,837
Wow, that's unbelievable.

533
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,338
But it doesn't really matter.

534
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,048
-It's a relief that Kyuhyun got it.
-Yes.

535
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,843
Here are the results of the prize mission.

536
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,387
With the elimination of one player,

537
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:53,056
the prize mission was a success.

538
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:56,935
100 million won has been added
to the accumulated prize money,

539
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:59,271
which now stands at 180 million won.

540
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:00,605
Let's go!

541
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:04,109
Here is the current Piece count
of each player now.

542
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,277
Kang Ji-yeong,

543
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,528
7high,

544
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:09,030
and Jeong Hyun-gyu
have the same number of Pieces.

545
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:12,033
The player with the most Pieces,
Choi Hyun-joon,

546
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:15,662
please choose one player
who will go to the living area.

547
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:20,500
Let's play again tomorrow.
Let's promise that.

548
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:21,877
Of course.

549
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:25,547
He's a good player
to be in an alliance with,

550
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:29,551
because the way I see it,
I'm the most "F" person in the world,

551
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:34,598
and Hyun-gyu said himself
that he's 100% pure "T."

552
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:37,392
It's very much a love-hate relationship.

553
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:41,146
I will take
Jeong Hyun-gyu to the living area.

554
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:44,858
Kang Ji-yeong,

555
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:45,942
Kim Ha-rin,

556
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,068
Son Eun-yu,

557
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,236
7high,

558
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,488
and Justin Min.

559
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:51,740
It has been decided
that you will be in the prison block.

560
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:55,702
Still, we did get some Pieces.
We'll give you some when you're back.

561
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:56,661
To the living area?

562
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:59,581
The living area and
prison block assignments

563
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:01,208
have been finalized.

564
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:04,794
All players, please make your way
to your assigned accommodations.

565
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,963
-Let's go.
-Bye. See ya.

566
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:09,508
Today's prison match is going to be fun.

567
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:11,760
-Justin!
-Bye.

568
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:14,304
-Let's go, Justin.
-Justin, you were the problem.

569
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:16,264
-Ji-yeong, Ha-rin.
-I'm off.

570
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,892
You'll share the Pieces when I get out?

571
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:21,311
The ones we got today,
share them when I get out.

572
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:22,646
-Good luck, Justin.
-Bye.

573
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:24,064
Bye, bye.

574
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:25,732
-7high, good luck.
-Yup.

575
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:29,319
-This might not be real.
-Let's go and talk about it.

576
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:30,737
This is all of us now?

577
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,908
The Ice. They said
they forgot about the Ice.

578
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:36,201
Apparently, Tinno used the Ice.

579
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,203
He used the Ice?

580
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,914
-So this is what it's like.
-Oh, it's fine.

581
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:41,998
It's nice and spacious.

582
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,043
There are more than enough beds.

583
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:47,587
Home sweet home.

584
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:50,340
-This is my third night in this bed.
-Exactly, I won't use that.

585
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:52,175
Oh, we're all standing by ours.

586
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:54,678
Hey, this is so realistic.
There are even blankets.

587
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:56,054
So this is what prison is like.

588
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:01,977
He's explaining.

589
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,812
Oh, do I have to wear this now too?

590
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:04,938
Yeah.

591
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:07,649
Oh, we even have towels.

592
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:10,193
It's a bit more comfortable
than I was expecting.

593
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:11,403
The living area

594
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:15,031
felt like the staff tried so hard
to make it look like a home.

595
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,616
Here, there's a theme.

596
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,535
The space is much more interesting.

597
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:19,452
Justin!

598
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:23,707
What's so funny is that Ha-rin keeps
trying to explain herself to Justin.

599
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:26,585
He accused me of betraying him
in yesterday's main match.

600
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:29,421
-He said I helped the opposing team.
-Oh, right. Can you tell him?

601
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,799
Did we cooperate with you
in yesterday's main match?

602
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:34,009
They didn't help us.

603
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,135
I was a bit angry, right?

604
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:36,469
I was like mad.

605
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,179
-He keeps saying I helped you.
-Us versus them.

606
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:39,973
-Really.
-Yeah.

607
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:41,641
I don't know.

608
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,268
-He doesn't believe you.
-I don't know.

609
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:45,228
-Just leave him be.
-He doesn't believe it.

610
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:46,771
Just leave him be.

611
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:50,525
I guess your trust in people drops
if you spend a lot of time in prison.

612
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:53,320
But you know what?
I feel more at ease here.

613
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:55,280
Why? Did you feel uncomfortable
in the living area?

614
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:56,197
I like it.

615
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,366
It was nicer and more fancy there,

616
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,826
but I felt empty.

617
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:03,496
You're just there. You feel like,
"We survived again, so what now?"

618
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,623
But you feel down here too.

619
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,041
You end up thinking,

620
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:09,044
"I should have done this or that
in today's game."

621
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:10,712
We felt that kind of regret.

622
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,797
-It's the same there as well.
-Really?

623
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:15,175
Because you're left with a bad aftertaste.

624
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:17,052
Right, absolutely.

625
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:19,971
Goodness. How long has it been?

626
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:22,098
Wow, my roommate has
been changed to Hyun-joon.

627
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,475
Welcome, you've been through a lot.

628
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:25,226
-Oh, this is nice.
-So-hui.

629
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,311
Welcome.

630
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:27,771
Will you be okay by yourself?

631
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:30,231
-Let's get on well together.
-You have your own room now?

632
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,067
This morning in prison, I told myself,

633
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,444
"If you want to die, you live,
if you want to live, you die",

634
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:37,364
so I went there with the intention
of dying, and I came back alive.

635
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:38,990
I really can't believe it.

636
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:41,785
Wow, I'm the only one
from the prison gang to come here.

637
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:43,703
We never expected this.

638
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:47,457
-We had no idea.
-We thought it would be max three of us.

639
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,501
The secrets hidden in this game were…

640
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:51,252
unbelievable today.

641
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:55,256
We figured it out
with unbelievable timing.

642
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,966
The double solid line. The battlefield.

643
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,386
Lee Se-dol, Choi Hyun-joon.

644
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:03,306
If someone else had figured it out
and used it on you, you would've died.

645
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,224
Exactly.

646
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:08,019
And to be honest,
we messed up the calculation in the end.

647
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:10,647
It was a game with a lot of variables.

648
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,858
But our calculation error
created another variable,

649
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,902
so I feel like
I stole the result off someone.

650
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:18,321
-Let's divide the Pieces as discussed.
-Let's do that.

651
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:20,156
We got ten,

652
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,159
so we can take one each.

653
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:25,453
Let's calculate Ha-rin's share as well.

654
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:26,871
Let's give it to her later.

655
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:29,791
But there are only five,
so one person has to forgo one.

656
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,459
I won't take it. You have it.

657
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:32,919
I'll give you one, So-hui.

658
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:36,923
No, I'm fine. I was just helping you
out of the goodness of my heart.

659
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:39,175
-I wasn't doing it for a Piece. Keep it.
-Even so.

660
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:40,927
If you take it, hey…

661
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:43,555
-So I'll give one to So-hui.
-It's okay.

662
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:45,056
-Just take it.
-Isn't that Ha-rin's?

663
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,057
Ha-rin's is here.

664
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:49,185
Take it. Give it to her.
Then everyone will be at ease.

665
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,271
-You helped me open it.
-Exactly, that's true.

666
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:53,022
But I didn't do it to get a Piece.

667
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:54,733
We know, but he's still giving you one.

668
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,484
And one of mine is Ha-rin's.

669
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,027
We were a team of six.

670
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:00,071
But with one of us in prison,

671
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:03,408
I'm holding on to Ha-rin's Piece
for the moment to give it to her later.

672
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:06,244
And I also gave one to So-hui
for helping me open the door.

673
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:07,996
I'm a bit worried about Ji-yeong,

674
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:10,582
because Ha-rin,
the legend of the prison match,

675
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:12,375
is there again today.

676
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:14,335
I mean, she's the queen of the prison.

677
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:19,132
-It's time to get changed.
-Are you getting changed?

678
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:20,175
You have a routine.

679
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:23,094
I only wear this
when I go for the main match.

680
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,012
Okay, I've got it.

681
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,180
This is my dress of blood.

682
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:27,056
You did spill a lot of blood.

683
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,476
Bread!

684
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,147
"Bread!"

685
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:36,900
What kind is it today?

686
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:38,818
-It's a new kind of bread.
-What is this?

687
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:40,945
This really is a different kind of bread.

688
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:42,363
Yo, no jam?

689
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:43,698
Is this really all we get?

690
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,784
But without milk,
you might break your teeth.

691
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,702
It might be okay soaked in milk.

692
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,079
Why is it so hard today?

693
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:51,372
How have you been surviving?

694
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,291
-It's an upgrade.
-Are you sure about that?

695
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:55,210
The bread looks great.

696
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:56,836
I love bread!

697
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,923
We ate a bit of bread now,
and some rice porridge in the morning.

698
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:02,634
Hey, does anyone
need any nails hammering in?

699
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:05,303
Wow, it looks really tasty.

700
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:06,387
Watch this.

701
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:10,350
See?

702
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:12,352
It doesn't leave a mark. Not even a dent.

703
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:15,230
You know what that means, right?
This is stronger than that.

704
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,232
If you toss it,
it might punch a hole in the wall.

705
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:21,319
But still, isn't it quite tasty?
I like this kind of plain bread.

706
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:23,655
Have you ever eaten bread soaked in tears?
I have.

707
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:26,533
Anyone who's never eaten tear-soaked bread
shouldn't expound on life.

708
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:29,786
I don't think I had something like that

709
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:31,663
even during my military service.

710
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:35,166
The food really made me realize
that I was in prison.

711
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,627
People kept saying,

712
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:41,214
"You're going to go to the living area
and get some tasty food today."

713
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:43,258
But I didn't quite believe it,

714
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,468
so I went around eating all the food.

715
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:48,304
I felt a kind of premonition at the end,

716
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:51,391
so I went around all the break rooms

717
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:54,519
hoovering up all the finger food.

718
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:55,687
Baguette.

719
00:30:57,313 --> 00:31:00,650
Having the foresight to tuck in like that
in case I ended up back in prison.

720
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:03,528
I'm amazed at my preparedness.

721
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:06,489
I'm finally here!

722
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:09,409
I thought I was going crazy.

723
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:12,704
I haven't looked in the mirror in ages.
Wow, is that how I look?

724
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:14,914
You know,
I was only in prison for two days.

725
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,041
So when I looked in the mirror,

726
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:19,544
I was a different person.
I'd lost a lot of weight.

727
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:20,587
Hyun-joon, you should eat a lot.

728
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,130
-I'm okay.
-Are you having that?

729
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,506
-No.
-Me neither.

730
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,424
Enjoy your dinner.

731
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:26,259
Bon appétit! Enjoy!

732
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,220
-How is it?
-It's so good.

733
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:31,222
It had been so long since I'd eaten rice.

734
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:34,225
They even gave us slices of avocado,
so when I saw that,

735
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:37,228
I thought,
"Wow, this is really luxurious."

736
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:40,148
In fact, when I was in prison,
I never thought about avocado,

737
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:43,151
I was just grateful
for any protein at all, but oh my,

738
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:46,446
here we had so many high-quality fats,
proteins, and things like that.

739
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:49,240
It was a really gorgeous experience

740
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:51,993
that washed away
all the hardships I'd been through.

741
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:53,077
Why aren't you eating?

742
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:55,038
Well, with 7high and everything,
I feel a bit…

743
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,081
I can't really stomach it.

744
00:31:57,165 --> 00:32:00,168
He hardly ate anything.
I ate almost everything on my plate.

745
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:03,046
And I'm not sure what So-hui ate.

746
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:05,715
Anyhow, I felt like
they were all taking it for granted.

747
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:08,301
So, I think they need
to experience prison.

748
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,219
Do you want more rice?

749
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:11,471
No, I'm full right now.

750
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:13,056
Help yourself to anything you like.

751
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:15,308
-I've let go of my resentment.
-Really?

752
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:18,102
So, today, are we just going it alone?

753
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:19,187
I guess we have to.

754
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:22,732
By the way, in yesterday's game
when Sang-yeon died,

755
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:23,858
did you perhaps…

756
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:24,901
-No.
-You didn't, right?

757
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:31,741
I never knew he was so enthusiastic.

758
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:38,373
That's a first.

759
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,416
Five of us is like, except Sang-yeon?

760
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:48,675
But I said, "Five against one
seems wrong. Let's not do it."

761
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:53,221
Then, everyone on their own.

762
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,640
-I said we shouldn't.
-Yeah, to each their own.

763
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:00,728
Yes, Hyun-joon, me and Ha-rin did it.

764
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,231
Because it increases the possibility
of one of you winning, right?

765
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:11,572
Yesterday we were like, "Stop it already,"
and now he's at it again.

766
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,866
We told him to drop it, but he won't.

767
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,327
I think Justin likes that kind of teasing.

768
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:18,162
-Yes, you're right.
-You're a teaser.

769
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,832
But yesterday it wasn't teasing.

770
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:24,335
-It was rage.
-But you really did betray me!

771
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:25,962
Those two…

772
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:27,422
He's starting again.

773
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:28,965
Three of you.

774
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:30,591
Give it a rest. I'm sorry.

775
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,552
I've triggered him again.

776
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:35,054
Before we started the prison match,

777
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:38,141
we were all like,
"Prison Team, let's do our best!"

778
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:39,892
Not during the main match yesterday.

779
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:41,477
That's so hilarious.

780
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,479
He's so funny.

781
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:44,522
I'm so annoyed.

782
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:46,482
It's so funny.
The chemistry between you two.

783
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:49,902
Honestly, the prison matches
are so ingenious.

784
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:52,530
But yesterday's one was
quite simple, right? The time one.

785
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:54,365
Simple but super fun.

786
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,784
Eun-yu, you really
seem like a natural-born fighter.

787
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,912
What are you talking about?
I haven't won anything at all.

788
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:03,624
Your fighting spirit. You come across
as a real leader on the battlefield.

789
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:04,751
That's because…

790
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:06,210
M&A.

791
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,843
You keep seeing it, right? That's why…

792
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:17,263
7high, who are you
going to play with this evening?

793
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:18,931
How are you playing the prison match?

794
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:23,102
Let's play as a team, the three of us.
In the prison match.

795
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:25,938
-Okay, let's play together.
-Let's do it together.

796
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:28,900
But if we have to get rid of someone,
I'd like to save Justin.

797
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:30,151
-You want to save Justin?
-Yes.

798
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:31,861
Save Justin, not Ha-rin?

799
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:33,863
-Then it's been settled?
-Okay.

800
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:37,909
I'm looking to build a new alliance.

801
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:39,368
They have a lot of Pieces,

802
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:43,206
so if I go to the living area,
they'll probably go with me.

803
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:45,541
So I think we can
play together again next time.

804
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,627
Can I let you in on a secret?

805
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,463
A secret? About where you went?

806
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:51,547
Yes.

807
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:57,929
-That's good.
-It is.

808
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,848
-I wanted to tell you and So-hui only.
-Okay.

809
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,851
-But I'm going to keep it from the rest.
-Sure, I won't tell anyone.

810
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,020
I'm tight-lipped.

811
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,897
-Still, I…
-I hope you don't end up in prison.

812
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,233
I hope you do well until the end.

813
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:12,235
-But you never know what will happen.
-That's amazing.

814
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:16,989
Are they telling us about tonight's game?

815
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:17,907
Yes.

816
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:21,494
The prison match will begin in 30 minutes.

817
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:24,330
Here are the rules
of the third prison match,

818
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:27,917
which will decide
the fifth player to be eliminated.

819
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,710
Today's prison match is

820
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,504
Sniper Hold'em.

821
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:33,297
-I knew Hold'em would come out.
-7high!

822
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,382
7high!

823
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:37,885
Sniper Hold'em is
a game where you win chips

824
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:41,889
to ensure your survival
by sniping your opponent's hand.

825
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:45,268
The player who draws the highest number

826
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:49,021
from between 1 and 5 shall go first,

827
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:51,899
and the game will proceed clockwise.

828
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:56,988
Sniper Hold'em uses four decks of cards
numbered from 1 to 10,

829
00:35:57,071 --> 00:36:00,616
and each player
shall be given 60 betting chips.

830
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,326
This is going to take ages.

831
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,244
Really?

832
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:04,620
Starting with the first player,

833
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:07,582
each lays down one chip
as their opening ante.

834
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:11,794
After the antes have been put up,
the dealer shuffles the 40 cards

835
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:14,672
and gives each player two cards.

836
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:19,343
These cards are personal cards
that are not revealed to other players.

837
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:25,183
After the personal cards are dealt,
the dealer reveals two more cards.

838
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:29,437
These cards are community cards
that can be used by all players.

839
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,272
So far it's regular Hold'em.

840
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:34,150
Once the two community cards
have been revealed,

841
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:37,695
the first player
shall make their first bet.

842
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:40,865
At this time,
the maximum bet that can be placed

843
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:45,870
shall not exceed the number of chips
held by the player with the fewest chips.

844
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:49,248
When the number of chips bet
by all players is the same,

845
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:51,375
the first round of betting ends.

846
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:56,464
Then, the dealer will reveal
two more community cards,

847
00:36:56,547 --> 00:37:00,134
and the second round of betting
will take place in the same manner.

848
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,677
Once the second round is complete,

849
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:06,015
using the two personal cards
and the four community cards,

850
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:08,517
the best combination possible
will make the player's hand.

851
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:10,519
You need to have played this before.

852
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:12,021
Hold'em players have a leg up.

853
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:15,566
Here are the winning hands
recognized in Sniper Hold'em

854
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:18,319
in order from highest to lowest.

855
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:21,113
Four of a Kind,

856
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:22,990
Full House,

857
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:24,909
Straight,

858
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:26,869
Three of a Kind,

859
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:28,579
Two Pair,

860
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:30,039
One Pair,

861
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:32,458
and lastly, High Card.

862
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:37,088
In Sniper Hold'em,

863
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:40,383
immediately before cards are revealed
to determine the winner,

864
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:42,927
players are given the opportunity
to shake things up.

865
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,929
-What's this?
-What is it?

866
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:46,305
Each round,

867
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:50,685
each player may predict
a certain combination of cards to snipe.

868
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,561
Oh, a prediction.

869
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:54,146
When sniping,

870
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:57,942
you must identify the highest number
of the combination.

871
00:37:58,025 --> 00:38:02,238
For example, a hand containing
4, 5, 6, 7, 8 is called 8 Straight,

872
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:06,075
and a hand containing 7, 7, 5, 5
is called 7 Two Pair.

873
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:10,538
A hand containing 4, 4, 4, 8, 8
is called 4 Full House,

874
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:14,792
with references the number
of the three matching cards.

875
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:20,214
When the sniping is over,
all players reveal their personal cards.

876
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:25,469
If any of the players
have a hand that was sniped,

877
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:28,097
they are automatically ranked last.

878
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:29,765
When you get sniped.

879
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:33,769
The highest ranking hand
that wasn't sniped

880
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:36,397
shall take all the chips that were bet.

881
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,358
So, you must snipe someone
who you think has a better hand than you.

882
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:42,486
If multiple players have hands
of the same ranking,

883
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:46,365
the player with the highest number wins.

884
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:50,661
If multiple players have the same hand
with the same numbers,

885
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:53,622
the player with the higher number
in their personal cards

886
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:55,875
shall be declared the winner.

887
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:58,377
If that still doesn't
distinguish a winner,

888
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:02,590
the next tie-break will be the sum
of the players' two personal cards.

889
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:05,801
If at this point, multiple players have
the same cards in their hand,

890
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:08,346
or all hands have been sniped,

891
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:12,391
the round shall be deemed a draw,
and the chips shall be shared equally.

892
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:15,186
If there are any chips left
after shared equally,

893
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:19,023
starting with the player who bet first,
players shall take a chip at a time.

894
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:22,610
During the game,
if any player accumulates 75 chips,

895
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:27,531
they will secure their survival
and return 75 chips to the dealer.

896
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,200
Seventy five…

897
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:32,078
If after returning 75 chips,
they still have chips remaining,

898
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:35,206
they may distribute them to the player
or players of their choice.

899
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:36,248
Hand them out?

900
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:41,962
However, they must give at least one chip
to any player who has no chips.

901
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:47,301
The game shall end when all players
except one have secured survival.

902
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:52,181
The last remaining player shall
be eliminated from The Devil's Plan.

903
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:56,102
The game will start in 30 minutes.

904
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:57,645
No extra Pieces starting today.

905
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,438
You're right.

906
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:02,024
-It's just a matter of survival then.
-Just survival.

907
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:06,278
But isn't this game so advantageous
to the Poker player, honestly?

908
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:09,281
I won't deny that, because I know
the ins and outs of betting.

909
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:11,367
I will endeavor to demonstrate

910
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:15,871
how I can make use of that
empirical advantage to ensure my survival.

911
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:18,791
So, no matter how bad your hand is,
you can still win.

912
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:21,293
You survive by
having a good hand not get sniped

913
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:23,462
or by having a terrible hand
and sniping someone.

914
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:25,047
You mustn't be obvious.

915
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:26,424
Let's give it a try.

916
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:28,175
Okay, here we go.

917
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:31,429
-Two cards to start.
-Right, and then look.

918
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,141
Then, two cards revealed like this.

919
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:36,642
Reveal the community cards.

920
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:38,227
And then, the betting starts.

921
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,812
-I'll bet two.
-Two? Okay.

922
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:40,896
I'll go two. Yes.

923
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,690
-I'll take two as well.
-That makes six.

924
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,150
Then I'll reveal the next two.

925
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,610
In this case…

926
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:49,989
The possible hands that can be made from
the community cards are

927
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:52,450
Four of a Kind,
Full House, Three of a Kind,

928
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:54,535
Two Pair, and One Pair.

929
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:56,662
Since Hyun-gyu went first,
we'll do another round.

930
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:57,788
I'll raise three.

931
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:58,998
I'll bet three too.

932
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:01,083
-Call?
-Okay, call. First call.

933
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:02,501
I'll raise 20.

934
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:04,253
Wow, yours must be good.

935
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:05,379
No, 30.

936
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:06,922
I have to fold if it's 30.

937
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:08,674
No, I think he's bluffing.

938
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:09,800
I'll do 40.

939
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:12,261
-Since we're sniping, 40 is fine.
-Then let's do this.

940
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:15,264
Let's snipe 8 Three of a Kind
and 8 Full House.

941
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:17,349
Since there are multiple 8s
in the community cards,

942
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:21,729
sniping hands that include 8
offers a high chance of success.

943
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,481
I'll do 8 Full House.

944
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:26,358
-Okay. Then you'll do 8 Four of a Kind?
-I'll take 8 Three of a Kind.

945
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:28,027
Really? Then I'll do 8 Two Pair.

946
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:30,738
-Okay, you're in? In for 40?
-Let's do 40.

947
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:31,947
Let's do this!

948
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:33,574
I have 8 Two Pair.

949
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:36,202
That's dead. Okay.

950
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:38,120
-I sniped it with the 8.
-You lost.

951
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:40,331
-This is mine. I had nothing.
-A 5 and 7.

952
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:41,540
I had 8 Three of a Kind.

953
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:43,459
Wow, you got sniped.

954
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:45,586
If he'd done 8 Four of a Kind,
I wasn't going to do it.

955
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:48,214
-What about you?
-I have 2 Full House. So I win it all.

956
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:51,717
-So this is how it works. This is fun.
-Nicely done.

957
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,886
-So, 40 from each of you, so I have 120.
-You survive.

958
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:56,931
If this Full House had been
successfully sniped as well,

959
00:41:57,014 --> 00:42:01,185
victory could have been achieved with
the lowest ranking hand of 8 One Pair.

960
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,151
Right.

961
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:11,487
I've played a bit of Poker,

962
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:13,739
so I knew roughly what was going on.

963
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:14,907
I was happy.

964
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,461
Let's go!

965
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:30,589
The prison match will begin shortly.

966
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:34,760
All players in the prison block,
please proceed to the death room.

967
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:54,905
They got a proper Hold'em table.

968
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:05,958
Wow, chips!

969
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:10,045
-Look at him playing with his chips.
-He looks like a master.

970
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:12,923
Because, you know,
this is 7high's wheelhouse.

971
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:15,509
He's going to really go for it.
He'll stake his reputation.

972
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,970
The third prison match,

973
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:19,555
Sniper Hold'em,

974
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:20,931
will now begin.

975
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:23,517
We will now draw cards
to decide the order of play.

976
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:24,560
Deciding who's first.

977
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:26,854
-Yes, the order is important.
-There's luck in the order.

978
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:29,857
Please take one card each.

979
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:39,199
From my left, please arrange
yourselves in the order of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

980
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:45,623
How did you feel there?

981
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:47,499
When you're standing there,

982
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,293
you're very careful
about each little thing.

983
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:51,670
But ironically,
that's what makes you make mistakes.

984
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:53,714
Your survival is dependent
on each move you make.

985
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:54,673
Right.

986
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:56,675
Please lay one chip as your ante.

987
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:02,723
So that's how Poker players bet.

988
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:07,144
Here are your personal cards.

989
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:21,325
Here are the first community cards.

990
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:26,914
The first player, 7high,
please place your bet.

991
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,290
Oops, I will fold.

992
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:29,625
You have folded.

993
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:31,543
I think 7high's quite nervous.

994
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:32,878
Why did he fold?

995
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:34,963
Because he wants to
assess everyone's character.

996
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:36,590
He wants to see how they play.

997
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:38,008
Fold.

998
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:39,468
Kim Ha-rin has folded.

999
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,180
Justin Min has bet one chip.

1000
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:45,766
Son Eun-yu has bet one chip.

1001
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:47,101
I'll do one as well.

1002
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:48,602
Kang Ji-yeong has bet one chip.

1003
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,604
Here are the remaining community cards.

1004
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:55,401
8, 1, 3, 1.

1005
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:58,153
A 1, 8, or 3 Full House are all possible.

1006
00:44:58,237 --> 00:44:59,530
Shouldn't they snipe triple 1s?

1007
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:01,240
Then 8 One Pair has a chance to win.

1008
00:45:01,323 --> 00:45:03,367
You could also just win with a high card.

1009
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:05,869
You have to find the probability
of all possible hands.

1010
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:07,996
Justin Min, please place your bet.

1011
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:14,503
You have bet two chips.
Son Eun-yu, please place your bet.

1012
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:23,804
You have bet two chips.

1013
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:25,264
Kang Ji-yeong, please place your bet.

1014
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:26,557
I will fold.

1015
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,808
You have folded.

1016
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:30,894
The sniping will now begin.

1017
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:33,313
Justin Min, please make your snipe.

1018
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:37,025
You have sniped 8 Two Pair.

1019
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:38,777
Son Eun-yu, please make your snipe.

1020
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:45,993
I will go for 3 Two Pair.

1021
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,911
You have sniped 3 Two Pair.

1022
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:51,206
Son Eun-yu, please reveal your cards.

1023
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:56,295
You sniped what I was going to snipe.

1024
00:45:56,378 --> 00:45:57,629
It's 6 Two Pair.

1025
00:45:58,213 --> 00:46:01,133
Justin Min has 2 Two Pair.

1026
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:02,801
Son Eun-yu wins this round.

1027
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:04,720
There's no way to guess that.

1028
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:06,930
-I will now give you 12 chips.
-Eun-yu.

1029
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:08,056
You'll be out in no time.

1030
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,975
-Good hand.
-Well played!

1031
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:19,485
Are you sucking up to me
now that I have close to 75 chips?

1032
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:21,862
-All of a sudden.
-Take it easy.

1033
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:23,781
The players chat this time.

1034
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:25,491
I think there'll be a lot of bluffing.

1035
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:26,784
For sure.

1036
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:28,410
Please place your ante.

1037
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,874
Here are your personal cards.

1038
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:46,011
Here are the first community cards.

1039
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:49,181
Got 1 One Pair already.

1040
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:50,557
Two 1s.

1041
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:52,726
-Don't they have to go for this one?
-Snipe 1 Four of a Kind.

1042
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:56,063
The first player, Kim Ha-rin,
please place your bet.

1043
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:04,988
I will bet two.

1044
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:06,114
You have bet two.

1045
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:07,491
Justin Min.

1046
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:19,795
You have folded.

1047
00:47:20,462 --> 00:47:21,421
Son Eun-yu.

1048
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:28,804
Can I bet more?

1049
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:29,888
Yes, you may.

1050
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:34,101
I will bet four.

1051
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:36,353
You have called two and raised two.

1052
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:38,272
Kang Ji-yeong.

1053
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:45,279
I will fold.

1054
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:46,530
You have folded.

1055
00:47:47,614 --> 00:47:48,657
7high.

1056
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:00,752
You have bet nine chips.

1057
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:01,795
Nine?

1058
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:03,255
Wow, really?

1059
00:48:03,338 --> 00:48:06,800
But with so few people,
you can't really do a lot of sniping.

1060
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,051
I bet he knew that.

1061
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:09,344
-Kim Ha-rin.
-I will fold.

1062
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:10,262
You have folded.

1063
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,475
I think if I were there,
I would've folded a lot too…

1064
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:17,019
-Me too.
-…unless you're certain.

1065
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:19,146
Son Eun-yu.

1066
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:24,526
I will…

1067
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:25,444
fold.

1068
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:29,573
Everyone has folded,
and 7high wins this round.

1069
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:31,074
I will give you 11 chips.

1070
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:36,830
Well played?

1071
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:39,499
You took them back.

1072
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:44,463
-Wow.
-He's indeed different.

1073
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:45,589
That's not bad either.

1074
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:48,383
See two cards and end things
before they go too far.

1075
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:49,635
Is there an alliance?

1076
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:53,263
I think 7high keeps
glancing furtively at Ji-yeong.

1077
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:55,015
Here are your personal cards.

1078
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:13,951
Here are the first community cards.

1079
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:19,456
The first player, Justin Min,
please place your first bet.

1080
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:25,587
You have bet one chip.

1081
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:27,881
Son Eun-yu has called.

1082
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:28,924
Kang Ji-yeong.

1083
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:38,141
I will…

1084
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:42,646
bet four.

1085
00:49:43,605 --> 00:49:46,817
Raise. You have called one
and raised three.

1086
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:49,486
-You're really going for it.
-7high.

1087
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:51,446
You have folded.

1088
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:54,700
I have to die, if you say so.

1089
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:56,368
Then why not earlier?

1090
00:49:56,451 --> 00:49:59,246
She's the symbol of trust and faith.
She just raised, so of course…

1091
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:00,789
Gosh, I'm hurt.

1092
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:03,125
Since Ji-yeong has bet,
he's not fighting with her.

1093
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:06,086
Also when 7high folds, they can't help
but feel the weight of him folding.

1094
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:07,421
Kim Ha-rin.

1095
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:08,380
I'll fold.

1096
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:09,297
You have folded.

1097
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:11,299
Justin Min has also folded.

1098
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:14,845
The symbol of faith and trust?
But I can't quit now.

1099
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:20,017
-You have called.
-Yes.

1100
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,186
I'll decide after I see the cards.

1101
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:25,689
Here are the remaining community cards.

1102
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:29,776
Don't you just need to snipe a straight?

1103
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,319
I don't think there would be a straight.

1104
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:33,947
-It's a fight between pairs.
-They started with 9 and 6.

1105
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:35,198
I think it'll be pairs.

1106
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:39,369
Son Eun-yu, please place your second bet.

1107
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:52,049
I will bet three chips.

1108
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:53,258
You have bet three.

1109
00:50:53,341 --> 00:50:54,342
Kang Ji-yeong.

1110
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:58,055
I will call.

1111
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:01,892
The sniping will now begin.

1112
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:04,144
Son Eun-yu, please make your snipe.

1113
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:20,660
I will snipe 7 Straight.

1114
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:22,788
You have sniped 7 Straight.

1115
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:25,957
Kang Ji-yeong, please make your snipe.

1116
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:31,421
But does whoever wins this get to leave?

1117
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:32,923
I haven't counted the chips yet.

1118
00:51:34,299 --> 00:51:35,717
It's 20, so that makes it exact.

1119
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:36,843
There's nothing left?

1120
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,303
It's exactly 20.

1121
00:51:39,554 --> 00:51:42,057
-It makes 75.
-I wanted to leave my extra for you guys.

1122
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,357
I will go for 9 Straight.

1123
00:51:51,316 --> 00:51:52,776
I will go for 9 Straight.

1124
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:55,987
Kang Ji-yeong has sniped 9 Straight.

1125
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:59,116
Kang Ji-yeong, please reveal your cards.

1126
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:00,158
That is 9 One Pair.

1127
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:03,161
You have nerves of steel.

1128
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:04,788
You did that with just a 9 One Pair?

1129
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:07,082
Son Eun-yu, please reveal your cards.

1130
00:52:07,165 --> 00:52:09,459
Kang Ji-yeong, your snipe was successful.

1131
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:13,171
-Amazing!
-Is that 8 and 7?

1132
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:15,507
Ji-yeong won with only a 9 One Pair.

1133
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:17,884
That changes everything

1134
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:20,846
because you could go in
knowing that you have the worst hand.

1135
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:24,015
I'll now give you 20 chips.

1136
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:26,101
-This is why we snipe.
-She called the 9 straight.

1137
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:27,811
9 straight, so she canceled out.

1138
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:31,565
I've got 69. I lost some at the beginning.

1139
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:33,733
There are more ups and downs
than I thought.

1140
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:35,569
Here are the first community cards.

1141
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:36,778
You have folded.

1142
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:38,071
Kim Ha-rin calls.

1143
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:39,656
You have folded.

1144
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:41,658
Here are the remaining community cards.

1145
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:44,995
After being shafted once when betting,
I'm scared to get to the sniping stage.

1146
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:46,079
I'll fold.

1147
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,081
Ha-rin.

1148
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:51,293
Good hand?

1149
00:52:51,376 --> 00:52:52,294
Good…

1150
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:56,882
I kept folding,
so I should go for it this time.

1151
00:52:56,965 --> 00:52:58,508
During this prison match,

1152
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:00,260
she's always smiling like this.

1153
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:04,848
I will fold.

1154
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:06,391
Kim Ha-rin wins this round.

1155
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:08,059
Here are the first community cards.

1156
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:09,561
-I'll fold.
-7high.

1157
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:11,396
You have bet two.

1158
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:12,439
I'll fold.

1159
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:13,356
You've folded.

1160
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,566
I'll fold as well.

1161
00:53:14,649 --> 00:53:17,235
Everyone has folded,
and 7high wins this round.

1162
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:18,945
He won that through sheer will.

1163
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:20,697
Here are the first community cards.

1164
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:21,781
You have folded.

1165
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:22,824
You have folded.

1166
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:24,576
You have bet three.

1167
00:53:25,785 --> 00:53:26,870
I will fold.

1168
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:28,872
Here are the remaining community cards.

1169
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:31,374
Justin Min, please place your bet.

1170
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:34,920
You have bet nine.

1171
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:36,755
Do you have a Straight?

1172
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:42,636
It's a big pot.

1173
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:43,637
She went for it?

1174
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,931
-Wow, this is…
-Eun-yu.

1175
00:53:46,014 --> 00:53:48,558
Justin Min, please make your snipe.

1176
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:51,353
7 One Pair.

1177
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:53,647
Is that how you see me?

1178
00:53:54,856 --> 00:53:55,690
All right.

1179
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:57,859
I will snipe 9 Straight.

1180
00:53:57,943 --> 00:54:00,320
You have sniped 9 Straight.

1181
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:02,447
Two Pair.

1182
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:04,366
Hey, oh, it's back to front.

1183
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:05,992
I was bluffing.

1184
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:08,411
5, 3. Oh, that was a gut shot.

1185
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:11,122
5 and 3. It was a bluff.

1186
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:12,332
Son Eun-yu wins this round.

1187
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:14,000
-Well played.
-This is really scary.

1188
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:15,502
7 and 4 makes it 7 High.

1189
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:16,920
When you have two cards,

1190
00:54:17,003 --> 00:54:18,463
-7 and 4 is "7high."
-So it is!

1191
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:19,798
That's me.

1192
00:54:20,298 --> 00:54:21,675
Here are your personal cards.

1193
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:33,728
Here are the first community cards.

1194
00:54:35,313 --> 00:54:37,649
Why do the cards
keep coming out like this?

1195
00:54:37,732 --> 00:54:39,442
What do you have…

1196
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:41,194
-Seriously.
-Keep your comments to yourself!

1197
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:43,905
-That good?
-Why are they like this?

1198
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:45,532
Kim Ha-rin, please place your bet.

1199
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:48,702
Hey, Ha-rin's going hard.

1200
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:51,162
Will she go for it or not?

1201
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:52,956
She's done it.

1202
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:54,124
Oh, four.

1203
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:56,126
You have folded.

1204
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:58,086
Why's everyone going for it?

1205
00:54:58,169 --> 00:54:59,004
Son Eun-yu.

1206
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:01,131
Yes. I will call.

1207
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:02,465
You have called four.

1208
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:04,301
Kang Ji-yeong.

1209
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:06,011
I don't do big bluffs.

1210
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:09,681
I'm in.

1211
00:55:09,764 --> 00:55:10,765
You have called four.

1212
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:13,226
-What's with everyone?
-7high has folded.

1213
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:17,480
So this is when you're supposed to fold.

1214
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:19,399
"So this is when"? You're learning?

1215
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:21,985
-I'm learning in real time.
-Here are the remaining community cards.

1216
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:30,493
Kim Ha-rin, please place your second bet.

1217
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:38,501
She's licking her lips? Huh?

1218
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:39,836
What is that expression?

1219
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:41,463
She must be tasting blood.

1220
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:45,133
-You can't tell what she's thinking.
-"Looks tasty!"

1221
00:55:45,216 --> 00:55:46,885
She must be smelling blood.

1222
00:55:46,968 --> 00:55:49,596
All kinds of techniques are coming out.

1223
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:51,806
I don't take them for beginners.

1224
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:54,893
I think everything is intentional.
I've put my goggles on now.

1225
00:55:54,976 --> 00:55:56,603
It's my first time playing Poker.

1226
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:58,063
You have bet three chips.

1227
00:55:58,146 --> 00:56:00,607
Oh, three? Why did you do that?

1228
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:01,733
She's doing it again.

1229
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:03,943
Why?

1230
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:07,697
-Stop running your mouth.
-Ji-yeong, are you going for it?

1231
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:09,240
I'm thinking.

1232
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:10,575
You're thinking?

1233
00:56:10,658 --> 00:56:12,660
Once you're done, can you let me know?

1234
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:15,997
Huh? Are you in or out?

1235
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:18,375
I call three and raise two.

1236
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:22,420
You have called three and raised two.

1237
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:25,924
Kang Ji-yeong.

1238
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:27,050
I will call.

1239
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:31,096
What? What's with Ji-yeong?

1240
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:32,514
This round is really big.

1241
00:56:32,597 --> 00:56:33,681
Kim Ha-rin.

1242
00:56:33,765 --> 00:56:34,849
I will fold.

1243
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:35,767
You have folded.

1244
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:37,811
What's with Ha-rin?

1245
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:40,522
Ha-rin was bluffing.
That lip-licking was a bluff.

1246
00:56:40,605 --> 00:56:42,816
These two don't go for it
unless they have something.

1247
00:56:43,858 --> 00:56:44,818
What the heck?

1248
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:46,653
Why is it always the two of you?

1249
00:56:47,278 --> 00:56:49,155
Son Eun-yu, please make your snipe.

1250
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:52,992
Win this hand and you're out of here.

1251
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:55,203
-Really?
-Graduation for either one of you.

1252
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:00,708
I guess Eun-yu isn't quite certain either.

1253
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:03,211
Gosh, sniping is so difficult.

1254
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:14,180
I just want to guess it right.

1255
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:18,810
Do you have One Pair again?

1256
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:21,062
One Pair?
Or did you bring another pair this time?

1257
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:23,398
-You two are amusing.
-You brought two pairs this time?

1258
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:24,357
I don't know.

1259
00:57:28,027 --> 00:57:30,029
I will snipe 5 One Pair.

1260
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:32,615
You have sniped 5 One Pair.

1261
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:34,242
-Kang Ji-yeong, please make your snipe.
-I'll get this.

1262
00:57:34,325 --> 00:57:35,827
Wow, snipe for One Pair?

1263
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:40,874
I'll snipe 5 Two Pair.

1264
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:43,418
You have sniped 5 Two Pair.

1265
00:57:43,501 --> 00:57:45,462
In any case, one of them is going to win.

1266
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:46,588
Give me your leftovers.

1267
00:57:46,671 --> 00:57:48,631
Kang Ji-yeong, please reveal your cards.

1268
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:52,510
She has 6 Two Pair.

1269
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:58,850
I was really agonizing
between 6 One Pair and 6 Two Pair.

1270
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:01,311
I have…

1271
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:03,897
a bunch of nothing.

1272
00:58:08,109 --> 00:58:10,278
-It was a bluff?
-Yeah, it was.

1273
00:58:10,361 --> 00:58:12,447
It's scary how fearless she is.

1274
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:14,365
How do you go that far with nothing?

1275
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:17,577
Kang Ji-yeong,
you have secured your survival.

1276
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:21,164
Wait, Eun-yu gifted that to her.

1277
00:58:21,247 --> 00:58:24,250
Excluding 75 chips,
you have ten left over.

1278
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:25,627
Ten.

1279
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:29,422
I have great expectations.

1280
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:31,424
Here, and also to 7high.

1281
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:33,009
Just give me three. Just three.

1282
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:34,802
Thank you.

1283
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:42,602
Kang Ji-yeong,
please return to the living space.

1284
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:45,605
Well played, Ji-yeong.

1285
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:47,357
Here, take some of my energy.

1286
00:58:50,401 --> 00:58:51,653
-Justin.
-Congrats.

1287
00:58:52,153 --> 00:58:52,987
Do your best.

1288
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:54,072
I'll fight to the end.

1289
00:58:54,155 --> 00:58:56,074
-Well played. I knew you'd be good.
-You're a player.

1290
00:58:56,157 --> 00:58:57,408
I don't worry about you.

1291
00:58:57,492 --> 00:58:58,326
She's good.

1292
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:04,499
Goodness me.

1293
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:07,669
Here are your personal cards.

1294
00:59:22,433 --> 00:59:24,060
Here are the first community cards.

1295
00:59:28,606 --> 00:59:29,983
There's a One Pair already.

1296
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:31,442
I think everyone will jump in.

1297
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:36,406
Justin Min, please place your first bet.

1298
00:59:36,489 --> 00:59:38,241
So we're starting with 9 One Pair?

1299
00:59:42,328 --> 00:59:43,329
I fold.

1300
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:44,330
You have folded.

1301
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:46,332
Son Eun-yu, please place your bet.

1302
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:48,209
I'll play honestly.

1303
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:52,130
I'm betting three.

1304
00:59:52,213 --> 00:59:53,548
You have bet three.

1305
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:55,049
7high.

1306
00:59:56,509 --> 00:59:57,927
If I win this, am I out of here?

1307
00:59:59,345 --> 01:00:00,555
How many is that?

1308
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:02,807
What?

1309
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:06,060
Why are you being like that?

1310
01:00:07,478 --> 01:00:09,814
-Why has he bet so many?
-I would have too.

1311
01:00:09,897 --> 01:00:10,732
The battle begins.

1312
01:00:10,815 --> 01:00:12,692
-You have called three and raised three.
-Oh, come on.

1313
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:14,402
I will get out of here.

1314
01:00:14,485 --> 01:00:15,862
How many do you have right now?

1315
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:18,406
If I win, I'm out.
So I went for it, fair and square.

1316
01:00:18,489 --> 01:00:20,158
-Seriously.
-Kim Ha-rin, please place your bet.

1317
01:00:20,908 --> 01:00:24,329
-If you win this, you're out, right?
-I am. That's why I bet truthfully.

1318
01:00:24,412 --> 01:00:25,496
Because I have them. Yes.

1319
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:29,626
You two have bluffed so much.
I don't trust either of you.

1320
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:33,046
Nice.

1321
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:35,048
Jeez, 7high.

1322
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:38,635
Gosh, you want to leech off me.

1323
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:41,054
Yeah, because you have a lot,
I don't have a choice.

1324
01:00:42,847 --> 01:00:44,599
Here are the remaining community cards.

1325
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,100
I'm nervous.

1326
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,314
-What the heck?
-Too many possibilities.

1327
01:00:51,397 --> 01:00:53,816
Three of a Kind or a Full House.
This is no good.

1328
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:57,403
Son Eun-yu, please place your second bet.

1329
01:00:58,446 --> 01:01:00,573
God, that's nuts.

1330
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,703
First up, I'll bet five.
And one moment please.

1331
01:01:05,787 --> 01:01:06,746
Five and…

1332
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:13,252
I'll see five

1333
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:14,712
and raise five.

1334
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:18,216
-You have bet a total of ten.
-Ten.

1335
01:01:18,299 --> 01:01:19,133
7high.

1336
01:01:20,259 --> 01:01:21,302
You're playing this?

1337
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:23,137
-Really?
-Called ten.

1338
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:25,640
You're playing this?

1339
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:28,643
Kim Ha-rin.

1340
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:34,524
So right now, 7high wants you
to think that he has a Full House.

1341
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:37,819
Do you have a Full House?

1342
01:01:37,902 --> 01:01:38,736
Do you really?

1343
01:01:40,154 --> 01:01:41,989
-What's with you?
-You have a Full House?

1344
01:01:42,073 --> 01:01:44,659
-Not a Full House. Four of a Kind?
-Just go already.

1345
01:01:44,742 --> 01:01:47,412
Aren't the odds of coming out
incredibly low for both?

1346
01:01:47,495 --> 01:01:49,330
But you're both betting like this?

1347
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:01,884
This is ridiculous.

1348
01:02:01,968 --> 01:02:04,512
-Whoever gets this is done.
-It's the biggest pot yet.

1349
01:02:04,595 --> 01:02:07,181
-How big is it right now?
-So-hui, it's really big right now.

1350
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:09,100
-What?
-I think it's more than 30.

1351
01:02:09,183 --> 01:02:10,685
The sniping will now begin.

1352
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:14,313
Son Eun-yu, please make your snipe.

1353
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:15,940
What are you going to snipe now?

1354
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:20,862
What were my cards again?

1355
01:02:21,612 --> 01:02:26,325
If you say that, it means
you're betting with nothing again.

1356
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:35,710
I will snipe 9 Full House.

1357
01:02:35,793 --> 01:02:37,754
-9 Full House.
-Yes.

1358
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:39,422
You have made your snipe. 7high.

1359
01:02:39,505 --> 01:02:41,007
I will snipe 9 Two Pair.

1360
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:42,759
You have sniped 9 Two Pair.

1361
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:44,677
Kim Ha-rin.

1362
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:48,556
So, the snipes were
a 9 Full House and a 9 Two Pair.

1363
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:51,309
Darn, 9 Full House and 9 Two Pair?

1364
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:56,355
There's also a 1 Full House.

1365
01:02:56,439 --> 01:02:58,858
-Exactly, but 1 seems…
-I don't think there'll be a 1.

1366
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:00,610
There's no chance anyone has a 1.

1367
01:03:00,693 --> 01:03:03,112
-Not with those bets before the reveal.
-But seeing as Eun-yu raised…

1368
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:04,572
Because of her confidence then?

1369
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:06,949
Eun-yu has 9 Two Pair.

1370
01:03:08,075 --> 01:03:09,118
I'm sure of it.

1371
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:10,703
-I have 9 Two Pair?
-Yes.

1372
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:12,538
-I… Really?
-Yes.

1373
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:14,457
Because you can't remember your own cards.

1374
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:15,917
-I have zip in my hand?
-Yes.

1375
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,085
If you don't remember,
that means you have nothing.

1376
01:03:18,169 --> 01:03:19,587
Anyhow, you can't win either.

1377
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:21,172
At this rate, none of us can win.

1378
01:03:21,255 --> 01:03:22,423
Is it a draw?

1379
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:25,551
Well, the chance of it
being Four of a Kind is so low.

1380
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:27,470
It's just so low.

1381
01:03:27,553 --> 01:03:29,388
You're already out of the equation.

1382
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:31,265
You can't win anyway, so just do it.

1383
01:03:31,349 --> 01:03:34,101
I'll tell you what I have.
I have 1 Full House.

1384
01:03:34,185 --> 01:03:37,480
Right, right.
You're better off getting rid of that.

1385
01:03:38,981 --> 01:03:41,025
-The 1 Full House?
-Yes.

1386
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:42,777
You have a 9, right?

1387
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:44,737
If you snipe the 1 Full House,
it's a chop.

1388
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:47,907
-Nobody can win, then.
-What he's saying is right.

1389
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:49,408
-That's true.
-I have 1 Full House.

1390
01:03:50,868 --> 01:03:52,912
I will snipe 1 Full House.

1391
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:55,623
-You have sniped 1 Full House.
-It's a chop.

1392
01:03:56,207 --> 01:03:58,167
Whip out a 1 Four of a Kind,
and I'll respect you.

1393
01:03:58,876 --> 01:04:00,920
If she really does, wow…

1394
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:02,964
I told you I have 1 Full House.

1395
01:04:03,047 --> 01:04:05,007
Kim Ha-rin, please reveal your cards.

1396
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:07,343
I have 9 Full House. I play honestly.

1397
01:04:07,426 --> 01:04:08,678
9 Full House.

1398
01:04:10,346 --> 01:04:11,180
I have, what's this?

1399
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:13,850
It's minimum chop,
so I was just messing around.

1400
01:04:14,809 --> 01:04:15,893
-9 Two Pair.
-A big nothing.

1401
01:04:15,977 --> 01:04:18,479
Right, so what did you say my cards were?

1402
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:20,731
A big, fat nothing?

1403
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:25,695
Could it be pocket 10s?

1404
01:04:26,404 --> 01:04:29,073
Oh, it is possible to have two 10s. Right.

1405
01:04:32,618 --> 01:04:33,828
Two Pair?

1406
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:37,790
The pot is a total of 52 chips.

1407
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:47,216
Please distribute the remaining
25 chips to the players of your choice.

1408
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:48,509
Shall I make you all the same?

1409
01:04:48,593 --> 01:04:51,012
Just give me one.
I'll appreciate your gesture.

1410
01:04:51,095 --> 01:04:52,805
And make everyone the same.

1411
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:54,932
-I think that's right.
-Okay.

1412
01:04:55,016 --> 01:04:56,601
-Fair game, right?
-Okay.

1413
01:04:56,684 --> 01:04:58,686
-I appreciate the gesture.
-Okay.

1414
01:04:58,769 --> 01:05:02,231
Son Eun-yu,
you have secured your survival.

1415
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:05,109
-Please return to the living space.
-Good luck. See you in a bit.

1416
01:05:06,819 --> 01:05:09,363
When there are three people left,
strangely enough,

1417
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:12,116
it's actually more tense
than when there are two left.

1418
01:05:12,199 --> 01:05:14,368
You think
there are only a few of you left,

1419
01:05:14,452 --> 01:05:17,121
and if you don't get out,
you end up in a one-on-one.

1420
01:05:17,204 --> 01:05:20,041
So when there are three people,
it's the most tense.

1421
01:05:30,509 --> 01:05:32,178
Please place your ante.

1422
01:05:35,014 --> 01:05:36,098
Let's do this.

1423
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:37,308
-Good luck.
-Let's make it fun.

1424
01:07:11,902 --> 01:07:16,907
