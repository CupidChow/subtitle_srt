1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:06,840
Come here.

2
00:00:06,923 --> 00:00:07,799
What?

3
00:00:07,882 --> 00:00:10,218
What is it?

4
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:11,344
What is it?

5
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:12,721
-What's this?
-What is it?

6
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:17,142
I think this opens as well. Pick this up.

7
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:19,644
Right, I kept saying this was a bit weird.

8
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:20,854
Well done.

9
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:22,272
How did I do, everyone?

10
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:23,398
Great job.

11
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:25,942
How did you even think to lift this?

12
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,570
I think it's a door.
There must be something down there.

13
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:30,238
-Let's lift it quickly.
-Yeah?

14
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:31,865
Wait. Let's read this first.

15
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:36,911
This is amazing.

16
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:38,038
It won't open yet.

17
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,372
Stick something in…

18
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,794
Do you think it's that thing? Maybe?

19
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,796
Surely it wouldn't be that?

20
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:49,382
What the heck?

21
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,426
Do you think this is some kind of hint?

22
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:54,471
-Do you think this is a hint?
-It couldn't be.

23
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:58,391
What's that?

24
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,310
-This can't be it, right?
-Let's try it.

25
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:03,730
-Really? I thought it fell off by mistake.
-Does it really fit?

26
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:04,939
This was just a mistake.

27
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,274
-But, this…
-Yeah, just a mistake.

28
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:08,359
-What's this?
-Maybe on the diagonal?

29
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:10,487
Yeah, this is it.

30
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,780
Seriously?

31
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:13,531
How did you figure this out?

32
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:14,824
Hey! This, wow…

33
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:19,954
I thought it would open if I yanked it,

34
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:22,207
so I did and the handle
just popped right off.

35
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,628
It was so freaky that that handle
just fit into the lid.

36
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,671
-I'm telling you it's the handle.
-This really is the handle?

37
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:31,716
I thought it was a mistake.

38
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,427
And this says "water." Why water?

39
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:38,556
There was a water drop symbol
and "water supply" in Chinese characters.

40
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,433
Shall we try putting water in here?

41
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,685
I don't think that would do anything.

42
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,229
Well, let's just try it.

43
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,440
-Shall I pour the water in?
-Pour it in.

44
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,692
Let's give it a try.
Feels a bit like holy water.

45
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,861
It probably won't do anything, will it?

46
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,196
Oh? It's filling up.

47
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:54,364
What is that?

48
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:55,990
-What is that?
-I was right!

49
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,118
-It's like an eyeball.
-What is it?

50
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,078
-An eyeball.
-That's it, right?

51
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:04,791
-There are words written on it.
-What does it say?

52
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:09,879
It's a riddle.

53
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:14,300
It's the future.

54
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:15,802
-It keeps coming.
-"Future" could work.

55
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:16,719
The future.

56
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,848
That just came up
when you poured the water in?

57
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:23,184
See, I'm not some weirdo.

58
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,603
Our teamwork is insane.

59
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,939
My fellow prisoners are doing so well.

60
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:30,150
I don't know
how they all ended up in here.

61
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:33,278
I think we can do more.
I think there's more to solve tonight.

62
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,487
We have to do this tonight.

63
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,531
"Future." Has it gone up?

64
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:37,574
Has it gone up?

65
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:41,703
There are letters?

66
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,923
Try turning it.

67
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:55,717
I can see it!

68
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,801
I've got it!

69
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:57,886
What is it?

70
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:58,887
What?

71
00:02:58,970 --> 00:02:59,888
Wait a sec.

72
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:00,930
What?

73
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,974
"Future" has seven letters, doesn't it?

74
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:07,103
One, two, three, four, five, six. F.

75
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:11,149
Match one to F and two to U.

76
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:14,110
Let's try that, right now.
I think we have to turn the letters.

77
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,738
-That's crazy! It's working!
-I found the handle.

78
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:17,822
What a dopamine rush.

79
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,282
But this is eight?

80
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,576
-Wait, it is eight.
-It's eight.

81
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:24,412
Then, we need to go back
and solve the riddle again.

82
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:30,585
Is there another word for future?

83
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,088
Future.

84
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:38,801
It's always coming, but it never arrives…

85
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:40,678
Death? No, that can't be it.

86
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:41,804
I thought of that too.

87
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,515
-Death arrives. What doesn't arrive?
-Death does come.

88
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,808
Future.

89
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:52,565
It's always coming for me,
but it never arrives…

90
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,108
Future does make sense.

91
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,693
"Future" but in eight letters.

92
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,820
It's not something like "paradise," is it?

93
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,949
Because paradise isn't coming.
Nor does it arrive.

94
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,994
Two, three, four, five, six…

95
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:05,912
No, eight letters.

96
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,164
Tomorrow?

97
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,041
It wouldn't be that, would it?

98
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:12,919
-Yeah, there was a W.
-There was?

99
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:13,962
I think that's right.

100
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:16,381
One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight.

101
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,883
-Let's try it.
-Amazing. Let's try it now.

102
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,097
Move your head.

103
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:28,142
-Didn't I say there was a W?
-"W." Yeah, I saw it.

104
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,560
This is so much fun.

105
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:32,230
Let's start with number 1.
"1" is T and "2" is O, right?

106
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,148
"3" is M.

107
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:35,942
"4" is O.

108
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:37,652
"5" is R.

109
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:39,153
"6" is R.

110
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:40,947
"7" is O.

111
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,825
"8" is W.

112
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,327
Done. Where's Se-dol?

113
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,328
In the bathroom.

114
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:48,705
Come out. What's he doing in there?

115
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,956
Se-dol, what are you…

116
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:51,499
Now's not the time for that!

117
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:53,126
At such an important…

118
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,544
Se-dol.

119
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,421
This is a historic moment.

120
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,798
We're going to lift this together.

121
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,677
-Grab it.
-Se-dol, grab it.

122
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,012
One, two, three!

123
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:26,659
THE DEVIL'S PLAN
DEATH ROOM

124
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,661
Wow, over here. Be careful.

125
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:30,955
Hey, what's that?

126
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,040
What is it?

127
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:33,750
Insane. Amazing.

128
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,211
-Hey, there's a message written here.
-I know.

129
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,212
Let's check it out.

130
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:39,380
Here I go.

131
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,090
-What is it?
-Be careful.

132
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,383
Should we move this?

133
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,595
It's quite dirty down here.

134
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,348
Amazing.

135
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,516
-There's a manhole cover here.
-Really?

136
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:56,189
"Prison block." What the heck?
"Welcome to the hidden stage."

137
00:05:56,272 --> 00:06:00,109
-Really?
-"Only one person is allowed to enter."

138
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,152
One person?

139
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:05,448
"The hidden stage is a test
of courage against your greatest fears."

140
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:09,410
"You must overcome them with a cool head
that remains unruffled, whatever happens."

141
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,204
"Succeed and this place will be gone."

142
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:13,790
"Fail and you will be eliminated."

143
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:17,001
"Another player may
try again 24 hours later."

144
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,921
But it's 24 hours later. Not the next day.

145
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:21,964
It's 24 hours later.
Not just after midnight.

146
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,967
Right, then you'll have
to be back in prison.

147
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:28,513
And it says that the hidden stage
will start when the manhole is covered.

148
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:29,889
-Covered?
-Once we close it.

149
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:32,225
One person comes in
and the rest have to close it.

150
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:35,895
That means we can't tell
what's happening inside at all.

151
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:39,816
Wait a second. Then, what do we do?
Someone has to go for it.

152
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:43,945
But the issue is that the people
in prison will change every day.

153
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,655
So we can't keep it a secret.

154
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:49,617
Okay, does anyone want
to take on the challenge?

155
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,495
Do you think the reward is a Piece?

156
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:53,955
-Probably a lot.
-Definitely.

157
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:55,331
Maybe ten Pieces?

158
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,708
But if you get ten,

159
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,460
that would be a huge benefit.

160
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,921
It would change the whole game.

161
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:04,382
-Who wants to go for it?
-But what's inside?

162
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:06,050
-No. Not now…
-With your life on the line.

163
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,971
You should keep all the Pieces you get
since you're risking it all.

164
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:11,305
-Sure.
-However,

165
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:14,225
everyone has different strengths…

166
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:17,270
and there is a sense of loyalty here.

167
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:20,022
I'm sure we'll support each other
like The Godfather.

168
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,315
Right.

169
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:25,403
If we'd found it halfway through,
I think I would have liked to try it.

170
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:27,321
I want to, but I'm too scared.

171
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:30,533
Let's be honest,
someone definitely has to try it.

172
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,201
But does it have to be today?

173
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:36,414
Quite frankly, since I wasn't
any help at all with figuring this out,

174
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:39,584
if none of you want to do it, I will.

175
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:43,671
Aren't you at all worried
about being eliminated?

176
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:47,049
It's not a matter of being eliminated.
I'm here to try and win.

177
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:51,053
-Well, if I put my life on the line…
-Wow, that's class.

178
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:54,474
If I'm eliminated, so be it.
But I could also have 10 or 11 Pieces.

179
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:55,516
Exactly.

180
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,518
I think it's going to be
one of two things.

181
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:01,814
Either Wall Go
or all three versions of Knight's Tour.

182
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:05,443
Why do I have the feeling
we'll have to solve Knight's Tour?

183
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:06,903
I've solved the 5x5 one.

184
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:10,031
I think we'll be able
to solve the 6x6, too.

185
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:12,825
What the?

186
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:13,951
Time for bed?

187
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,077
We should sleep.

188
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,205
-Lights out.
-It must be 11 o'clock.

189
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:18,789
Oh, my head.

190
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:30,384
I mean, did we really come here to study?

191
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:33,971
We have to. Don't you get
the feeling of community with this?

192
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:37,183
Hard to get used to, right?
Aren't you forcing yourself to do it?

193
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:41,979
-Honestly, I didn't come here to study.
-You're ready for bed.

194
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,607
This isn't studying. This is work.
We have to solve it.

195
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,527
When your face appeared
on the screen earlier,

196
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,779
you didn't look like
you were here to work.

197
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:50,863
I can say that for sure.

198
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,616
Really? You caught me. I've been had.

199
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:58,079
Is there an algorithm for Knight's Tour?

200
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:00,915
Is there a certain pattern
that allows you to fill it all up?

201
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:03,376
From what I've seen…

202
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,711
Let me share what I've got.

203
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:08,798
Looking at the 5x5 square,

204
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,133
let's say, "A" is the starting point.

205
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:14,387
"a1" is where you can move to from there.

206
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:19,141
And then, "a2" is
where you can go on the following move.

207
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:24,313
Therefore, it has to be symmetrical,
given the number of squares.

208
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:28,150
To solve the 5x5 grid,

209
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:33,030
it goes like this:
a1, a2, a3, a4, a3, a2, a1.

210
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:36,701
Then following that,
step 2 goes to an "a1" square.

211
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:39,954
Then, the next move
has to go to "a2" square.

212
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:43,791
Then, "a3, a2, a1,"
and so on and so forth.

213
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:48,045
So, I assume the 6x6 grid
will also follow the same logic.

214
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,922
It seems like it should work.

215
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:53,426
It looks like it should, but why isn't it?

216
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,553
Justin has fallen asleep.

217
00:09:55,636 --> 00:10:00,141
A good night's sleep will help us
focus on getting revenge

218
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:01,684
in the main match tomorrow.

219
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:14,363
Since Knight's Tour is a one-player game,

220
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:18,075
I was sure
that there couldn't be any other game.

221
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,203
I couldn't sleep after that.
I became hell-bent on solving it.

222
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,831
Knight's Tour is something
we can prepare for in advance.

223
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:28,294
This knowledge will be
half the battle for whoever goes.

224
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:30,963
Unlike other games,
we can prepare for this one.

225
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:34,592
Listen. We've been
going around like this, right?

226
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:37,637
After moving one lap around,
we need to wrap around the other way.

227
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,473
We eventually need a way in,

228
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,224
but it gets all blocked off
in one direction.

229
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,185
I think I've solved it.

230
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,854
Can someone give me a 7 by 7?

231
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:53,361
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

232
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:55,905
Studying really is
just a matter of perseverance.

233
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:59,867
You're up to 45.
Right, you need to get to 49.

234
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:03,204
That's why I'm not sure
if there is a pattern to this.

235
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,331
All eyes are on you now,
you need to see it through.

236
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:06,374
I think you got it.

237
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:10,461
Right, I think that's it,
but I might've messed up somewhere.

238
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:13,673
21, 22…

239
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:16,467
23, 24…

240
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:19,178
Turn at 24. You turn at 24.

241
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:23,599
-26, 27, 28, 29…
-Now you're back up. 28, 29, 30…

242
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,142
Now, go around again.

243
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,936
30, 31, 32…

244
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,521
Now, loop back around again.

245
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:31,232
Wow, how do you go
back and forth like that? Next is 34.

246
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:32,942
How does it end up like that?

247
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:34,777
37.

248
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:36,529
38.

249
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,156
39, 40.

250
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,451
41, 42, 43.

251
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,578
-44, 45.
-Yes, 45 is here.

252
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:48,290
-46, 47, 48, 49.
-You got it.

253
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,294
-Wow, amazing.
-That was so tough.

254
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,630
She really got us to the finish line.

255
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,006
Yep, let's go to bed.

256
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,383
Amazing. It's beautiful.

257
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:58,884
I can keep going.

258
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,052
-42.
-You got it.

259
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:03,389
-43, 44…
-No, here.

260
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:04,640
45.

261
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,058
Hang on.

262
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,268
47.

263
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,272
49?

264
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,737
-I love you, sis.
-I love you, too.

265
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:21,574
Wow, this is nuts.

266
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:23,701
I can now die without any regrets.

267
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:26,120
Wait, we still have the 6x6 grid left.

268
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:32,668
I could've solved it before sleeping
if we had some more bread and milk.

269
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:33,753
Gosh.

270
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,966
What the heck?
Have you started research on another one?

271
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,469
Solved it.

272
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,596
1, 2, 3, 4.

273
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:48,058
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

274
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:51,061
11, 12, 13, 14.

275
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:53,939
15, 16, 17.

276
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,816
Okay, then bring it back around.

277
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,236
18, 19, 20, 21, 22.

278
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,780
23.

279
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,782
-24, 25, 26.
-To the corner and back up.

280
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,825
27, 28.

281
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,536
-29, 30.
-Great.

282
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,790
-Go up.
-31, 32, 33, 34, 35…

283
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:14,043
Nice! That's it! It's over.
Wow, well done.

284
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:16,045
But is it past midnight already?

285
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:16,962
Not yet.

286
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:19,757
Right on time.
We're basically clocking out on time.

287
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,370
Did you solve it?

288
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:51,956
I think we have, but the 6x6 one…

289
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,290
-Couldn't solve it?
-I did it.

290
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:54,250
You did?

291
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,460
-You did the 6x6? Amazing.
-Yes.

292
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,004
Did you just do it?

293
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,840
I just did it little by little.

294
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,258
Amazing.

295
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,110
What?

296
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:25,531
Do you know where Ji-yeong is?
Has she gone somewhere?

297
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,825
-Who?
-Where has Ji-yeong gone?

298
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,827
That's me. I'm Ji-yeong.

299
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,537
Sorry, I'm not wearing my glasses.

300
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:35,416
Sorry. Hang on a second.
Let me just go and wear a mic.

301
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:44,008
That was embarrassing.

302
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:46,135
That's so funny. What's up?

303
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:49,346
I was going to give this to you yesterday.

304
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,348
-Please keep it to yourself.
-Thank you.

305
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,100
-I'm off. Bye.
-See you later.

306
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:01,483
What is it?

307
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,193
Keep it to yourself.

308
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:07,323
There are four people with four Pieces,
and Ha-rin has two Pieces.

309
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:10,367
It'll be really tough for the rest of us
unless we really kill it

310
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:11,827
in the main match.

311
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,705
I sent a message to
all the players with just one Piece.

312
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:17,499
I'm hoping to play
a good game with them today.

313
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,584
Eat up.

314
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,044
Yes, we should.

315
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:22,296
-Who knows when we will next?
-Yes, exactly.

316
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,590
They probably slept together
in the same room.

317
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:26,675
I think there's a good chance

318
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,678
-they'll come back as thick as thieves.
-I think so.

319
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:33,265
I'm sure with a bit of resentment as well.

320
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,975
Wow, it's rice porridge.

321
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,977
Bon appétit!

322
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:40,773
It feels like ages
since I've had proper food.

323
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:43,484
We need to have a proper breakfast.

324
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:46,362
We're going to be eating
lunch in hell today.

325
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,535
But yesterday, as I was lying in bed,

326
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,080
-I kept seeing "1, 2, 3, 4…"
-Just numbers everywhere.

327
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,918
Not really asleep
even with my eyes closed.

328
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,544
How did you solve the 6x6 grid?

329
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:06,048
The 6x6 grid was so random.

330
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:09,301
So, there was no pattern?
You just solved it by trial and error?

331
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,595
I don't know. I just did it randomly.

332
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,222
What, you can do it randomly?

333
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,391
The 5x5 and 7x7 grids
followed a slight pattern.

334
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,434
I think the 6x6 grid
was the most difficult.

335
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:20,062
Okay then,
what are we going to do about this?

336
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:23,148
Does anyone want to go? Underground?

337
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,526
What should we do?

338
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:32,032
Even though I know the solution,
it's hard to memorize it.

339
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:33,742
It's such a waste.

340
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:37,371
But what if I die while I'm in there?

341
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:38,455
What?

342
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:40,374
What if I die in there?

343
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,381
Are you thinking of going?

344
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:49,174
-Are you fifty-fifty?
-Yeah.

345
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,843
Solving the 6x6 grid changed your mind?

346
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,469
Completely.

347
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:55,264
Here come the lights.

348
00:16:56,432 --> 00:17:01,145
It seems a bit rash to do it now.
Don't you think we'll get another chance?

349
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,275
Knew it. I forgot the 6x6 grid already.

350
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,944
-Totally. That's the way it is. Me too.
-So it's true.

351
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,321
Do you think everyone
is working on the same thing?

352
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:14,033
What do you think everyone is up to?
I'm getting curious.

353
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,784
I guess they're done here.

354
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,996
What's everyone up to?

355
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,789
Tinno, you have to see this.

356
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:21,707
What's up?

357
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,208
You have to see this.

358
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:27,254
No, don't say anything. Oh, she saw us.

359
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,757
Honestly, So-hui.

360
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,342
-She's the best.
-Extraordinary.

361
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:35,012
I think we're far too normal.

362
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,847
Seriously, we're way too normal.

363
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,099
Turning the brain upside-down must help.

364
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:42,394
If we end up in a group match,
do you have anyone in mind?

365
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:43,729
People to team up with?

366
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:45,647
In case it's team against team?

367
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:46,732
I think Eun-yu.

368
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,901
-Eun-yu, right.
-She is playing really well.

369
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:51,987
I like So-hui
who was my fellow thief yesterday.

370
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:55,157
-Yeah, mathematically, she's just…
-So-hui is really smart.

371
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:03,582
46, 47… I think I might be able to do it.

372
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:09,421
It'd be such a waste because you're
basically halfway through the 7x7 grid.

373
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,590
It's time to make a decision.

374
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:14,093
There's no more time to think it over.

375
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,762
So, anyone who wants to go for it,
please raise your hand.

376
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:20,140
I clearly said that I'd go
if there was no one else. Here we go.

377
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:23,393
I'm not confident enough to go for it now.

378
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:24,311
I'm not going.

379
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:26,271
Okay. What about you three?

380
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,482
I don't think I ever will if I don't now.

381
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:33,362
But Se-dol said that he'd do it
if no one else volunteered.

382
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,364
I did think there was a chance that

383
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:38,325
Se-dol could solve it
with flying colors and make it back alive.

384
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:39,535
I'm going to pass.

385
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,539
Right, two left.

386
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:54,550
I just didn't want
all that work last night to go to waste.

387
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,009
The 5x5 and 6x6 grids are done?

388
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,678
-Is 6x6 completely done?
-It is.

389
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:00,347
I think I can finish the 7x7 grid
in about 30 minutes.

390
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:03,058
Will you be able to memorize
all three grids?

391
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:05,811
Shall I give it a try?

392
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:07,521
After solving the problem,

393
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:12,276
I'd feel so pathetic if I left here
without doing anything, so…

394
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,111
Let me try it one last time.

395
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:17,447
Check for me. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5…

396
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:21,076
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16…

397
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,495
-You think this'll be the game?
-I'm not sure.

398
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,913
45.

399
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:26,540
And below 45.

400
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:29,209
46, 47, 48, 49.

401
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,754
-She can do it.
-As long as I get these two right.

402
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,006
Your focus is amazing.

403
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,424
I think I can really do it.

404
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,009
Yes, I think so, too.

405
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,386
If you say you'll go,
everyone will be on board.

406
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,055
You got this.

407
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,390
-Thanks.
-Good luck!

408
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:45,559
-Goodness.
-I hope she makes it through.

409
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,770
You'll make it and come back.

410
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:52,816
Take it slowly. Nice and slow.

411
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,736
-Okay. I'm not sure.
-Are you ready?

412
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:58,322
-I'll go as far as I can.
-Don't fret if it isn't Knight's Tour.

413
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:00,908
-Yeah.
-I hope you can solve it and come back.

414
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,159
Seung-hyun will be back.

415
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:03,911
-I'm sure you'll be back.
-Totally.

416
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,245
We'll shut it now.

417
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,205
Good luck!

418
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,915
-Oh my goodness.
-Go for the comeback win.

419
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:10,167
See you in the living area
or on the outside.

420
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,877
-Good luck!
-Bye.

421
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,420
Don't forget us.

422
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:15,505
-Let's go for an underdog win.
-Good luck!

423
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:20,928
This feels so weird.

424
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:22,596
Good luck!

425
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,223
I'll be cheering for you!

426
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:26,975
I got this!

427
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,810
The moment the manhole was covered,

428
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:34,233
I got really excited because I thought
I might get the chance to really shine.

429
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:41,615
Oh, my.

430
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:44,409
This is unbelievable.

431
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,251
Can we not hear anything?
Nothing at all? No sound?

432
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,752
I don't think we can.

433
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:54,878
I can't hear anything.

434
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:57,047
So she just goes in there and plays.

435
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,178
Kyuhyun.

436
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,140
If I end up in a desperate situation,
please help me out.

437
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:09,351
-Let's work together. Really.
-How about me?

438
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:12,396
If you're truly sorry
about what happened yesterday,

439
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:15,232
then please help me out
if I ever get into serious trouble.

440
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:17,276
Let's help each other.

441
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:19,027
Don't be wishy-washy about it.

442
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:22,030
I'm not trying to be.
Are you not going to help me?

443
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,074
You already have four Pieces.

444
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:25,951
Oh, because of the Pieces?

445
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:28,453
Sure, if there's something
I can do with the Pieces.

446
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:32,457
Nobody thinks Se-dol is going to lie.

447
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,042
To be honest, I hardly ever lie.

448
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,752
Exactly.

449
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:39,047
That's why in the moment of truth,

450
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:42,342
if you try to bluff,
we might have a chance at winning.

451
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:43,927
What you say carries weight.

452
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:44,928
Yes.

453
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:48,056
-I'll see what happens.
-There you go again telling the truth.

454
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,891
No commitment, just consideration.

455
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:00,819
Eliminated!

456
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:07,451
ELIMINATED
LEE SEUNG-HYUN

457
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:12,748
Please make me look pretty
for my last shoot.

458
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,875
Even if I'm a mess right now…

459
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:20,672
When I went in,
there was a really long, dark tunnel.

460
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:23,050
I was suddenly splashed
with water from above.

461
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:25,719
It got really dirty as I passed through.

462
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:28,889
I think that space made me
really feel the pressure.

463
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:32,017
I thought,
"Oh, I shouldn't underestimate this."

464
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,603
"The Devil's Plan is no joke."

465
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,773
What is The Devil's Plan to me?

466
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:44,071
A book that I found really interesting
but wasn't able to finish?

467
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:47,699
You promise yourself that you'll go back
to that bookstore to finish it,

468
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:50,243
but you rarely do.

469
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:51,870
That is how I felt.

470
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:55,040
The pages I did manage to read
were so interesting.

471
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:59,628
I think they'll remain in my memory,
and I'll be able to look back on them.

472
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,963
The most memorable moment was

473
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:07,469
the fun I had with Eun-yu
solving the 7x7 grid.

474
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:10,847
After all the hardships
we went through together,

475
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:13,975
I hope she finds
the strength to make it to the final.

476
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:15,769
Eliminated!

477
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:29,074
Is this how it goes?

478
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:30,367
You did well.

479
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,413
-I feel awful.
-What the heck is that?

480
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:37,582
Seung-hyun… Eun-yu, are you okay?

481
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:42,504
Let's put the letters back
the way they were.

482
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:49,052
Is Eun-yu okay? Is she crying?

483
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:11,908
Are you okay, Eun-yu?

484
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:15,662
Why are you crying?

485
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:19,708
It was just so hard, mentally.

486
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,294
Since she'd solved the 6 by 6,

487
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:27,757
I told Seung-hyun I thought it would be
a waste if she didn't go for it,

488
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:30,469
but now I'm wondering
if I put too much pressure on her.

489
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:33,763
-Already?
-Don't do that.

490
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,682
What the heck? Why?

491
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:36,850
-What the heck?
-Why?

492
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:40,187
What happened? That's such a shocker.

493
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,980
I barely got to speak to her.

494
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:43,857
Exactly, I never even talked to her.

495
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,650
Just eliminating left and right.

496
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:49,488
But to lose two people in one day…

497
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:52,574
It feels like we've become close
just after one day.

498
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:53,575
Right.

499
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:55,118
It must be amplified in prison.

500
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,204
I'm sure there were
even stronger ties there.

501
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:58,580
Are you okay?

502
00:24:58,663 --> 00:24:59,748
Are you okay?

503
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:00,665
Yes.

504
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:04,377
-You can't even tell.
-We even mixed up the letters.

505
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:05,378
You did?

506
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:07,172
It was the perfect crime.

507
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:09,966
We need to get our stories straight now.

508
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,594
What are we saying if the others ask?

509
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:15,472
Just say there was something in here.

510
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:17,390
Just "something"?

511
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:21,102
But if we say that,

512
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,562
they'll hound us for details.

513
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:24,439
But they must know already.

514
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:27,901
-They'll immediately know something is up.
-They'll assume that.

515
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:32,906
I don't have the slightest intention
of sharing what happened

516
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:34,908
with the living area folk.

517
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:36,618
-So we're down to five now?
-Yes.

518
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,329
-We started with seven.
-We did.

519
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:40,580
And they still have seven.

520
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,832
It'd be a majority alliance,

521
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:46,253
but three of them
were just saved by the others.

522
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:49,714
-Maybe we make that coffee for them now?
-Along with some hot dogs.

523
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,258
Shall I make all seven cups?

524
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:52,968
It's five now, not seven.

525
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:56,346
First of all, the important thing is
how we act out there.

526
00:25:56,429 --> 00:26:01,768
Since there are five of us,
we could actually become an alliance.

527
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:04,521
Right. Three on their team
are pretty powerless.

528
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:07,607
So, there is a chance
the other four could team up.

529
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:10,110
Those four will definitely stick together
until the end.

530
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:11,903
We'll have our swords out for them.

531
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:14,406
How can you say that
while wearing that red dress?

532
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:16,241
Got to dress for the occasion.

533
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:19,327
I think we're actually
the ones doing that.

534
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:22,664
-Today, we dance with our swords out.
-We have to support her.

535
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,499
Right, she has two Pieces.

536
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,042
Time for a sword dance.

537
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:29,087
I'm looking forward to
hearing about life in prison.

538
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:31,923
I wonder how Seung-hyun got eliminated.

539
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,049
I'm curious, too.

540
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:36,261
There must have been
some twist in the game.

541
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:39,598
Perhaps there was a high-risk reward like
being able to come to the living area.

542
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:42,642
-To this degree.
-It must have been if she risked her life.

543
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:46,605
I did feel a bit strange
in bed last night--

544
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,649
Better to just keep quiet.

545
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:50,734
Seriously?

546
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:52,861
The main match will begin shortly.

547
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:55,822
-Please make your way to the game area.
-Let's go!

548
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:58,408
Don't forget the coffee.

549
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:01,911
I'm going to try all the finger food
in all the rooms today.

550
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:03,663
They say if you try to die, you live.

551
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:04,831
Of course.

552
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:08,293
Se-dol, we have to crush it today.

553
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:13,423
What's that?

554
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:15,675
My goodness. What is all this?

555
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:19,095
Hello.

556
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:20,639
There you are. Hi!

557
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:24,476
Did you really bring this
because I told you that you owed me one?

558
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:28,063
-Jeez, you guys have been through a lot.
-Hello, everyone.

559
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,981
Oh, it's bread. What is it?

560
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,775
Hot dogs, but there's no ketchup.

561
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:33,860
-Why not?
-There wasn't any.

562
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:35,320
-Ji-yeong.
-Sorry, no ketchup.

563
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:37,614
-Well done.
-My goodness.

564
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:39,324
I'm back, alive and kicking.

565
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:40,450
Let's shake hands.

566
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:44,162
I survived the death match.
Let's work together today.

567
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:46,539
My college junior, Sang-yeon,

568
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,708
passed me a note.

569
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:52,504
It had the solutions to
the 6x6 and 7x7 grids of Knight's Tour.

570
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:54,839
But we also already solved it.

571
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,966
I still appreciated the sentiment.

572
00:27:57,592 --> 00:28:02,055
5 HOURS LATER

573
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:03,390
Who killed them just now?

574
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:07,686
You're trying to make an enemy of me.

575
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:10,689
I think we can make Sang-yeon win.

576
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:12,148
Yeah, we were thinking that.

577
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:14,776
From now on,
we need to just kill them all.

578
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:17,862
There's no mercy anymore.

579
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:25,120
Did you know
that we watched your game live?

580
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,955
-Really?
-We saw everything.

581
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,248
Greetings.

582
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:31,918
The second main match
of The Devil's Plan will begin now.

583
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:36,005
CHUU and Lee Seung-hyun
have been eliminated,

584
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:39,426
-which leaves 12 surviving players.
-What happened to her?

585
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:40,552
There was another game.

586
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:41,553
An individual match?

587
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:42,887
Before we begin,

588
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:46,099
here is the current Piece count
of each player.

589
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:50,979
Currently, Yoon So-hui,
Kyuhyun, Jeong Hyun-gyu,

590
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:54,357
and Tinno possess the most Pieces.

591
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:58,820
Let me introduce the second main match.

592
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:02,323
Today's main match is Unknown.

593
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:06,536
Unknown is a game that requires you
to figure out the hidden rules

594
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:10,999
and arrive first
at the center goal square to win.

595
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:16,171
Unknown's game board consists of
eight different colored squares,

596
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:20,341
red, yellow, blue, green,
purple, and white game squares,

597
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:24,763
the gray starting squares,
and a black goal square.

598
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:29,642
Each player will be given
a counter shaped like a cube,

599
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:33,855
and the six faces on it will be
red, yellow,

600
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:39,694
blue, green, white, and purple.

601
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,113
When the game begins,

602
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:45,784
players will choose their starting spots
and place their counters on them.

603
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:48,411
If multiple players wish to start
on the same square,

604
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:50,914
they must negotiate to take that square.

605
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:57,295
The order of play will start with whoever
is in the lowest numbered starting square.

606
00:29:57,378 --> 00:30:01,591
Even if a player's starting square
changes during the game,

607
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:04,010
the order of their turn will not.

608
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:07,931
On every turn,
each player will advance one square.

609
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:12,727
They can go up, down, left, or right.

610
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:17,524
If another player's counter is
already on the square they are moving to,

611
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:19,567
they will push that player's counter

612
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:23,655
one square over in the same direction
before occupying that square.

613
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:29,452
A round ends when all players
have finished moving their counters.

614
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:31,871
The following rounds will continue
in the same vein

615
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:35,041
until one player reaches the goal square.

616
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:38,336
That player will be declared the winner,
and the game shall end.

617
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,421
At the end of the game,

618
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:45,301
players will be ranked from high to low
based on the numbers

619
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:48,471
of the squares their counters occupy.

620
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:49,722
The closer you get…

621
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:54,185
The first player to reach the goal
shall receive three Pieces,

622
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:57,939
while those in second through fifth place
receive one Piece each.

623
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:01,901
Those are the basic rules of Unknown.

624
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:06,406
However, there are also
additional hidden rules.

625
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:08,408
So that's why it's called "Unknown."

626
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:12,829
If a counter movement triggers
a hidden rule,

627
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:15,999
the dealer will proceed with the game
in accordance with the rule,

628
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:18,835
but they will not tell you
what the rule is.

629
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:20,420
They're hidden from us too?

630
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:25,425
There will be a three-round practice game
before the game officially starts.

631
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:29,846
If you figure out the hidden rules
during this practice game first,

632
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:32,724
you will have an advantage
going into the game.

633
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:37,228
Additionally, at the end of each round
of the official game,

634
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:40,231
one of the hidden rules shall be revealed.

635
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:44,694
The rules to be revealed and their order
have been predetermined.

636
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:49,073
Now, let me explain today's prize mission.

637
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:53,536
If only one player is eliminated
by the end of the main match,

638
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,331
100 million won will be added
to the final prize.

639
00:31:57,332 --> 00:32:00,001
You will now play a practice game.

640
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:02,420
The same rules will apply
in the official game.

641
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:05,924
Please make good use
of this practice game.

642
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:08,927
Do you think it's better
to have a big alliance or a small one?

643
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,845
I think a smaller one will be better.

644
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,181
Sang-yeon gave me a note

645
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:16,809
suggesting an alliance
between the people without Pieces.

646
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:19,187
I agreed with that.

647
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:22,023
Also, in my case, Kyuhyun and I…

648
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:24,692
Let's try to go for low numbers
during the practice game.

649
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:27,153
…along with Tinno were
in an alliance already.

650
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:30,907
In the practice game,
we should go for the lower numbers.

651
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:33,493
We'll go for 1, 2, 3, 4…
Let's give it a go.

652
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:36,829
And I thought keeping that going would be
a good idea for this game.

653
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:39,832
Players must place their counters
in starting squares

654
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:42,210
within the next three minutes.

655
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,505
It's weird seeing my face on there.

656
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:46,839
7high.

657
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,303
Park Sang-yeon.

658
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,099
-Is it first come, first served?
-Yes.

659
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:57,517
Since it's a practice game.

660
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,352
Color is also important.

661
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:01,562
I like red, so I'll start here.

662
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,773
Your time is up.

663
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:06,150
You will receive sample counters
that can be used

664
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:07,568
as reference points for moves.

665
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,696
I guess we look at this while we play.

666
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:11,739
This should be fun. Finding the rules out.

667
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:12,657
Yes.

668
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,952
All players have now chosen
their starting squares.

669
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:18,454
The game will begin with the player

670
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:21,708
who occupies
the lowest numbered square, 7high.

671
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:25,044
Each player will tell the dealer
which direction to move their counter.

672
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:28,339
The dealer will then move
the counter accordingly.

673
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:31,092
7high, which direction would you like
to move your counter?

674
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,719
Straight ahead, please.

675
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:34,762
Moving toward the yellow square.

676
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:37,473
Please choose
a different color to face up.

677
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:40,268
So that means… Okay, we've got one rule.

678
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:42,478
You have to change it
to be a different color?

679
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:44,564
Can I have this face up?

680
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:45,940
-Red side up?
-Yes.

681
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,026
You cannot have the red side facing up.

682
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:50,737
Currently, you may only choose
from either green or white.

683
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,196
-You can't change.
-Change what?

684
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,158
He can't change it to red.

685
00:33:58,536 --> 00:33:59,954
Is this direction your choice?

686
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:02,457
Yes, that's right.

687
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:06,961
7high, you have been exiled.
You will be given one exile token.

688
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:07,920
Exiled?

689
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:09,714
I will give you one exile sticker.

690
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:11,132
What the heck?

691
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:14,052
Please place your counter
on a new starting square.

692
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,094
-I choose?
-Yes.

693
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:18,639
-What color on the die? Red?
-What was the first color?

694
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,058
What's the opposite of white?

695
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:21,851
Yellow.

696
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,896
-When he changed to white, he was exiled.
-I see.

697
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:27,398
If you match the yellow color,
I think you get exiled.

698
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:31,110
Does exiled mean restart?

699
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,404
Back to your original starting square?

700
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:35,114
You may put it wherever you want.

701
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:36,741
So he could've gone to 11 or 14?

702
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:38,409
-Yes, that's possible.
-Okay.

703
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,536
Maybe there's something
about face direction?

704
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,537
We'll have to see.

705
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:43,748
I was exiled for having white on top.

706
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:46,626
-That's the hint.
-Park Sang-yeon, please move your counter.

707
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:48,211
I will move to 17.

708
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:51,047
Park Sang-yeon is moving to 17.

709
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,508
Park Sang-yeon, you have been exiled.

710
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:58,971
You will be given one exile token.

711
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:01,766
Please place your counter
on a new starting square.

712
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:03,893
-Was that a white square he was on?
-Yes.

713
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:06,020
There's something about yellow and white.

714
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,063
Exactly.

715
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:11,567
When yellow and white
both showed up together, you got exiled.

716
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,152
Is that your final choice?

717
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:14,195
Yes, it is.

718
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:16,489
Okay. Kyuhyun is next.

719
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:20,034
I think I'll change color.
I will move straight ahead.

720
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,828
-Moving to square 19.
-Okay.

721
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,831
Kyuhyun, please choose
a different color to face up.

722
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:26,999
Do I have two choices?

723
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:29,627
-Please choose a color.
-It can be anything?

724
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:32,004
-I'll let you know after you decide.
-So, you can't tell me?

725
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:33,339
I will change it to green.

726
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:35,550
You cannot change it to green.

727
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,385
-If you…
-You can either choose yellow or red.

728
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:38,719
That's why I asked you.

729
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:41,013
Ask him to do it for you once.

730
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:42,890
Okay, red or yellow.

731
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,059
Why red or yellow? Why those two?

732
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,269
I will do this.

733
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,063
-Is this the direction you choose?
-Yes.

734
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,189
Have I avoided exile?

735
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:51,232
He wasn't exiled.

736
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,609
-Lee Se-dol is next.
-I will move straight ahead.

737
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:55,194
-Kyuhyun was untouched?
-Right.

738
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:57,071
Moving one square forward.

739
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,782
Se-dol, please choose
a different color to face up.

740
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:03,411
If the square color matches
the color facing up, you have to switch.

741
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,204
You're exiled if the same colors meet.

742
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,544
-Is this direction your choice?
-Yes.

743
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,383
Tinno is next.

744
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:19,302
Which direction would you like to move?

745
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:21,179
I will move to 27.

746
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:23,347
Moving to number 27.

747
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:24,473
Change your color.

748
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:26,601
Please choose
a different color to face up.

749
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:27,518
Okay.

750
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,937
So, you definitely have to change

751
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:32,398
if the color of the square matches
the color facing up.

752
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:34,192
I will switch to blue.

753
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:35,526
-Blue facing up.
-Yes.

754
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,278
-Is this correct?
-Yes.

755
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:38,905
Tinno.

756
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:43,201
Please select a player with blue facing up
and move their counter one square.

757
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,120
-Why?
-What happened?

758
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:49,415
Players with blue facing up?
There are a lot of blue players.

759
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:52,376
-Only the blue players?
-Their blue side must be facing up.

760
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,086
-I choose Master Lee Se-dol.
-Back?

761
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,504
In which direction?

762
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:56,422
Forward.

763
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:58,216
-To square 24?
-Yes, that is correct.

764
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:04,055
Lee Se-dol, please choose
a different color to face up.

765
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:05,223
What?

766
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,893
But you cannot change it to blue.

767
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:11,520
You may choose it to be green,
red, or white.

768
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,026
Green, red, white.

769
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:21,364
-Is this direction your choice?
-Yes.

770
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:26,244
Please select a green player
and move their counter one square,

771
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:27,411
and then yours well.

772
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:29,288
Wow. That's the best.

773
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:31,457
Since there is no green player,

774
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,209
you may move your own counter again.

775
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:34,669
Then, he gets to go twice?

776
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,129
Just once.

777
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,047
I'll go straight.

778
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,882
-Moving to 35?
-Yes.

779
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:47,473
Please select a red player
and move their counter one square.

780
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:51,060
Currently, the only red player is
Justin Min.

781
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:53,604
In which direction
would you like to move him?

782
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,648
I will move him to 42.

783
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:57,108
Moving to square 42.

784
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:03,030
Justin Min, you have been exiled.

785
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:07,535
-Please move to a new starting square.
-He didn't even move yet.

786
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:09,120
You will be given one exile token.

787
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:10,579
Why was he exiled?

788
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:16,085
How did you move him?

789
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:17,461
From 7 to 42.

790
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:18,754
"7 to 42."

791
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:22,425
You get exiled
if you have white at the bottom, right?

792
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,677
But this also resulted in exile.

793
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,972
Kang Ji-yeong is next.

794
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:31,642
-I will move to the red square.
-Let's see what happens.

795
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,728
-Moving to square 23.
-Yes.

796
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:38,774
I see.

797
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:40,901
Facing each other…

798
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:43,779
I put it there on purpose.
To see if it could get pushed.

799
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,114
Justin Min is next.

800
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:46,532
I will go to 25.

801
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:48,492
Moving to square 25.

802
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,786
Justin Min, you have been exiled.

803
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,872
I will give you one exile sticker.

804
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:54,415
White is important…

805
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,751
So, white-yellow
and yellow-white were exiled.

806
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,461
White-red as well.

807
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:01,255
Please place your counter
on a new starting square.

808
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:02,757
Choi Hyun-joon is next.

809
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,841
Hyun-joon to purple?

810
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:06,677
Shall I move to 57 to check? Okay.

811
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,888
White? You might be exiled.

812
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:09,972
I'll go to 57.

813
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:11,849
-Moving to square 57.
-Yes.

814
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:14,060
You have been exiled.

815
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:15,019
As expected.

816
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:16,645
You will be given one exile token.

817
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:19,065
Please place your counter
on a new starting square.

818
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:23,235
Kim Ha-rin is next.

819
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:25,404
I will move to 47.

820
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,740
-You have been exiled.
-What?

821
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:30,242
Please place your counter
on a new starting square.

822
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,745
Son Eun-yu is next.

823
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:34,872
I will go to 22.

824
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:37,458
-Son Eun-yu, moving to square 22.
-Okay.

825
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:40,795
Please choose
a different color to face up.

826
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:43,214
Try changing to white
to see if you get exiled.

827
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,508
-Facing up?
-Yes.

828
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:47,009
I will choose white to face up.

829
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,428
-Is this correct?
-Yes.

830
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:52,014
Son Eun-yu, you have been exiled.

831
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:53,432
White led to exile.

832
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:54,767
What's the condition?

833
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:57,228
If anything is white,
that gets you exiled for sure.

834
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:59,188
-To square 14?
-Please choose a square.

835
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:00,606
-Like this?
-Yes.

836
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:02,525
Yoon So-hui is next.

837
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:05,444
I will roll to 30.

838
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:07,488
Moving to square 30.

839
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:10,074
Please choose
a different color to face up.

840
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:11,450
-How about yellow?
-Okay.

841
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:13,744
Shall I place it like this?

842
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:18,165
-Jeong Hyun-gyu is next.
-Is nothing happening?

843
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,875
Where would you like to go?

844
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:21,127
Yellow…

845
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,962
There's too much information.

846
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:24,964
I will move down to 75.

847
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:26,674
Moving to square 75.

848
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:29,135
-Exiled?
-You have been exiled.

849
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:30,803
You will be given one exile token.

850
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:33,722
Being exiled is one thing,
but they're giving us exile tokens.

851
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:35,641
They're giving us exile tokens, so…

852
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:38,352
Place your counter
on a new starting square.

853
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,898
Round 2 will now begin.

854
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:45,151
7high, please move your counter.

855
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:47,736
Can we take five? Thank you so much.

856
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,822
Let's sort out what we know.

857
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:53,784
So, don't you think the colors
of the square and the side facing up

858
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,411
are the most important?

859
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:57,538
This is what I think.
Your counter is here.

860
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:00,082
There are eight squares around you.

861
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:02,001
I think this is related somehow.

862
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:05,838
Just now, when it was Se-dol's turn,
he was told to move another counter.

863
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:10,176
Please select a green player
and move their counter one square,

864
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:12,678
and then yours well.

865
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:18,100
Please select a red player
and move their counter one square.

866
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:20,144
If two adjacent sides
are the same color as you,

867
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:21,812
I think you move yours and another's.

868
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,314
By "adjacent," you mean…

869
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:26,317
If they're touching, you get an extra move
and another for any same-colored player.

870
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,404
One next to you and one on the diagonal,
just one extra for another player.

871
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:34,200
Tinno moved like that earlier.

872
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:36,160
Wait. Tinno's is different.

873
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,496
-Can I see?
-What can I show you?

874
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:41,123
-First…
-It was yellow.

875
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:43,834
-Yellow was facing up.
-Only white and green were possible.

876
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:45,586
But on my turn,

877
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:48,839
with blue facing up,
only red and yellow were possible.

878
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:52,134
So, only certain colors are possible.

879
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:55,471
Maybe it all depends
on the adjacent squares?

880
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:57,181
Round 2 will now begin.

881
00:41:57,264 --> 00:41:59,683
7high, please move your counter.

882
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,644
Move me straight and exile me, please.

883
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:05,648
7high, you have been exiled.

884
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:06,774
Go somewhere nice.

885
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:08,526
You will be given one exile token.

886
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:10,986
Where are you going to go? The same place?

887
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:13,906
Park Sang-yeon is next.

888
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:15,741
I will move to 17.

889
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:18,786
You have been exiled.

890
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:20,120
I'll stick this on you.

891
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:23,707
Can you get unlimited exile tokens?

892
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,709
-I'm not at liberty to disclose that.
-Okay.

893
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:29,046
I can't tell if exile tokens are
good or bad.

894
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:31,840
Maybe you can save them up
and use them later.

895
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:32,758
Exactly.

896
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:34,426
Kyuhyun is next.

897
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,136
I will move one square forward.

898
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:42,142
Nothing happened.

899
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:44,520
Lee Se-dol is next.

900
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:46,105
I will move to 54.

901
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:49,400
Nothing happened to me?

902
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:50,943
That's a shame.

903
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:52,194
Tinno is next.

904
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:54,029
I will move to 26.

905
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:56,365
Please choose
a different color to face up.

906
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:01,036
I will change it to red.

907
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,746
-Is this correct?
-Yes.

908
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:09,753
Tinno, please select a red player
and move their counter one square,

909
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:11,422
and then yours as well.

910
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:15,509
Right now, the only red player is 7high.

911
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,011
Which way will you move him?

912
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:19,138
-7high, let's go!
-Let's go!

913
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:21,599
-No choice.
-Let's all push ahead together.

914
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:24,018
I will push Seven to 18.

915
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:27,563
Tinno, you may also move
your own counter one square.

916
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:30,399
Yes, I will go to 25.

917
00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:33,444
Please choose
a different color to face up.

918
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:34,987
I will change it to blue.

919
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,780
-Is this correct?
-Yes.

920
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:40,284
I think the face direction
makes a difference.

921
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:41,410
The face direction.

922
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:43,746
-The direction of your face?
-Yes.

923
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:46,707
Just now, when someone faced
towards the gray,

924
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:48,334
they were yeeted.

925
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:49,793
Justin Min is next.

926
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:51,629
I will move to 63.

927
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:53,380
Moving to square 63.

928
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:57,009
I think you have to be
looking at the color.

929
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:59,094
Please choose
a different color to face up.

930
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:07,895
Justin Min, please select a green player
and move their counter one square.

931
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:09,104
See. I'm right.

932
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:13,484
-I think the direction is important.
-You're right.

933
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:15,110
Choi Hyun-joon is next.

934
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:16,570
Please push me toward 38.

935
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:19,114
-He has to change the color.
-I think so.

936
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:20,658
Hyun-joon, change your color.

937
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:24,119
Please choose
a different color to face up.

938
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:25,996
Try green. You shouldn't be able to.

939
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,123
But still, try. We need him to confirm.

940
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:29,833
Please change it to green.

941
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:31,418
You may not change it to green.

942
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:32,711
See. Good.

943
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:36,965
You may switch it
to yellow, blue, white, or purple.

944
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:38,050
Wait a second.

945
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:42,179
If none of the eight squares
around you are the same color,

946
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:43,472
you can change your color.

947
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:47,393
But you can only change it
to the color of one of those eight.

948
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:48,936
Son Eun-yu is next.

949
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:51,730
I will move to 24.

950
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:56,568
Please select a green player
and move their counter one square,

951
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:58,320
and then yours as well.

952
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:01,532
I will move 7high to 22.

953
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:04,868
7high, please choose
a different color to face up.

954
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:08,205
I have no idea,
so I will do whatever you tell me to do.

955
00:45:08,288 --> 00:45:09,665
How about this?

956
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:12,042
Yellow with red on the right?

957
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,627
Okay. That's what I'll do.

958
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:15,087
-Is this direction correct?
-Yes.

959
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:21,135
7high, choose a player of any color
and move them one square…

960
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:22,344
What the heck is this?

961
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:23,971
…and then yours as well.

962
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:26,473
-I can move someone else and my own?
-That is correct.

963
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:29,351
Wow, that's some insane variation.

964
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:31,937
What did I do for that to happen?

965
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:35,649
I'll move this one to 60.

966
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:37,609
Moving Tinno's counter to square 60.

967
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:42,656
-Tinno, please change your color.
-Okay.

968
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,700
Tinno, do it like this.

969
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:46,994
-Like this?
-Yes, okay.

970
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:49,413
-Is this correct?
-Yellow's okay, right?

971
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:50,998
7high, please move your counter again.

972
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:54,168
I will go to 13.

973
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:55,794
That is impossible.

974
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:58,046
-You should either go back or forward.
-Forward.

975
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,923
Forward won't teach us anything.

976
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:03,093
Fine. I will move to the white square.

977
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:07,181
-7high, you have been exiled.
-That must be a definite rule.

978
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:09,183
You will be given one exile token.

979
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:10,517
Okay, exiled three times.

980
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:12,936
If this was the real game,
7high would have

981
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,855
lost three Pieces.

982
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:15,939
-What? How come?
-Three?

983
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:20,611
If this was real, 7high would have
no Pieces and he'd be eliminated.

984
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:23,614
So, now we know
that being exiled is not good.

985
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:25,240
The first two are okay, but the third…

986
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:26,909
The third one? That's when you're out?

987
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:28,577
You're out as soon as you get it.

988
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:32,581
So, this could be a form of attack.
If you move someone to white…

989
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:34,416
Eliminated for good.

990
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,626
A lot of people could go.

991
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:38,003
The prize for this is 100 million

992
00:46:38,086 --> 00:46:41,465
to stop us from exiling left and right.

993
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:43,884
We have to agree to not exile each other.

994
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:46,220
You could eliminate
a lot if you wanted to.

995
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:48,472
We get 100 million
with only one elimination.

996
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:51,350
We will have to save people
from getting exiled.

997
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:53,769
Round 3 of the practice game
will now begin.

998
00:46:53,852 --> 00:46:55,312
Park Sang-yeon is next.

999
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:58,148
I don't have a choice. I'll move to 17.

1000
00:46:58,232 --> 00:46:59,358
And probably get exiled.

1001
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:01,276
Park Sang-yeon, you have been exiled.

1002
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,820
You will be given one exile token.

1003
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:05,614
If this were the real game,
you'd relinquish three Pieces.

1004
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:07,366
This is surprisingly scary.

1005
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:08,700
Tinno is next.

1006
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,744
Yes, just give me a moment, please.

1007
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:11,745
Tinno, try 99.

1008
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:14,957
Okay, let's go down.
Let's see what else we can find out.

1009
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:15,874
Good.

1010
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:17,584
I will go to 99.

1011
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:19,127
Wait. That does something.

1012
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:20,212
-It does?
-Yes.

1013
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:24,383
Please select any player
and move their counter one square

1014
00:47:24,466 --> 00:47:25,425
and then yours as well.

1015
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:26,552
Mine too?

1016
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:28,971
Move anyone's counter and your own?

1017
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:32,975
Basically, when it's like that
with yellow on top,

1018
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:34,685
I think that's what happens.

1019
00:47:34,768 --> 00:47:38,063
The best outcome is when you can move
your own counter and someone else's.

1020
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:42,734
Just now, when he came down,
he switched to yellow.

1021
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:44,695
Green under and yellow on both sides.

1022
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:46,822
So, that could be a rule?

1023
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:48,699
-Let's test it out.
-Okay.

1024
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:50,701
I will move So-hui to 43.

1025
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:53,787
-Is that it?
-Right.

1026
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:55,998
Yes.

1027
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:58,750
Yoon So-hui,
please move your counter one square.

1028
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:02,045
But this is difficult.
Can't go forward. You have to come back.

1029
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:04,339
I will retreat to 28.

1030
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:07,926
Please choose
a different color to face up.

1031
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:10,304
What don't we know?
Something about purple.

1032
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:14,224
-Purple, green… There's nothing, right?
-I think so.

1033
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:15,726
Shall we try green on purple?

1034
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:18,312
I will change it to green.

1035
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:20,230
-Is this correct?
-Yes.

1036
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:25,611
Tinno, please move
your counter one square.

1037
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:28,363
You get to move
when it makes a straight line.

1038
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:30,949
You were yellow and sandwiched by yellow.

1039
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:32,409
It was three in a row.

1040
00:48:32,492 --> 00:48:34,745
Same for So-hui, she was blue at 43.

1041
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:35,871
Then, you moved.

1042
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:38,081
When you moved it,
you had to change color.

1043
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:41,084
If you have three of the same color,
you can move your own--

1044
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:44,671
But the thing that confuses me is
that if you're in the middle,

1045
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,423
do you move one by yourself?

1046
00:48:46,506 --> 00:48:48,842
Or is that when you're at the end?

1047
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:52,012
One of them involves moving
another person as well.

1048
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:53,847
The diagonals aren't counted then?

1049
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:54,973
They're irrelevant.

1050
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:56,141
Choi Hyun-joon is next.

1051
00:48:56,224 --> 00:48:59,519
Se-dol, let's chat. How should I proceed?

1052
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:03,398
If I push that forward,
blue will be facing up.

1053
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:05,734
-And there's a blue right here.
-Let's try it.

1054
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:09,112
Then he'll probably ask me
to pick and move a blue player.

1055
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:10,697
These are your eight adjacent squares.

1056
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,032
-That's what I'm saying.
-That's right.

1057
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:13,367
-It's all right.
-But there's only two.

1058
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:15,285
But there's still another blue
in the vicinity.

1059
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:16,912
Three. It should be three.

1060
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:18,997
Would you please move it to 69?

1061
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:20,749
Yes, just straight forward from there.

1062
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:23,543
Move your counter one more square.

1063
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:25,337
-Oh, yours?
-Moving your own counter?

1064
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,631
-Next to 12? Okay, we must be right.
-Yes, he moved. Right.

1065
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:29,257
Let's keep this to ourselves.

1066
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:31,969
They probably heard it too.
Are you the only one that knows?

1067
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:33,595
-Yeah. I didn't tell anyone.
-Wow.

1068
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:35,430
Please push me forward to 70.

1069
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:36,723
Moving to square 70.

1070
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:42,020
Oh? It's over. So, that's--

1071
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:42,938
That wasn't it.

1072
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:44,064
Son Eun-yu is next.

1073
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:45,649
I will move forward.

1074
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:47,150
Moving to square 24.

1075
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:49,444
Then, there's going to be a big migration.

1076
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:51,863
Please choose
a different color to face up.

1077
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:53,573
What could the face directions mean?

1078
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:54,616
I'll switch to green.

1079
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:55,784
Yes, change it to green.

1080
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:57,869
-Like this, please.
-Like this?

1081
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:03,917
Please select a green player
and move their counter one square,

1082
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:05,502
and then yours as well.

1083
00:50:05,585 --> 00:50:07,337
That's how you do it.

1084
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:10,674
You move either way, but if you're
in the middle, then someone joins you.

1085
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:12,342
On the side, then only you move.

1086
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:14,302
So-hui, you went 45, 44, 43, right?

1087
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:16,763
Yoon So-hui, please move your counter.

1088
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:17,889
Just by myself.

1089
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:18,890
Just you?

1090
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:23,020
Please select a green player
and move their counter one square.

1091
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:27,315
I will move Yoon So-hui's counter to 43.

1092
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,279
Now, please move your own counter.

1093
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:35,574
I will go to 35.

1094
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:42,122
I'm done.

1095
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:44,166
Done just like that?

1096
00:50:44,249 --> 00:50:46,084
Was I facing the wrong direction?

1097
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:48,879
Is direction important too?
The direction of your face?

1098
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:51,590
Right, so nothing happened
because I wasn't facing yellow.

1099
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:52,883
Nothing should happen.

1100
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:54,801
-Yoon So-hui is next.
-It's my turn?

1101
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:56,136
I should go up.

1102
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:59,097
Go up. If you go up,
these three can connect.

1103
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:00,223
Let's see if it works.

1104
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:02,559
Try it. That could work.

1105
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:04,936
Okay, I will move to 65.

1106
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:09,858
Please select a purple player
and move their counter one square.

1107
00:51:09,941 --> 00:51:11,318
Jeong Hyun-gyu is next.

1108
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:12,694
I will go to 60.

1109
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:16,865
Please select a blue player
and move their counter one square.

1110
00:51:16,948 --> 00:51:18,533
Right now, Tinno is the only blue player.

1111
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:20,160
I will move Tinno to the goal square.

1112
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:22,788
He put me in?
Right, because he's the last one.

1113
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:24,998
That concludes the practice game.

1114
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:28,543
I hope you were able to figure out

1115
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:30,921
lots of the hidden rules of Unknown.

1116
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:33,090
The exact causes and effects are a bit…

1117
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:35,175
Let's see. So many uncertainties still.

1118
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:36,343
Hyun-gyu is back.

1119
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:38,303
-Should we work with him for now?
-Yeah.

1120
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:40,263
I'm not sure if we can trust him here.

1121
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:43,642
So, be a bit wary of Hyun-gyu.
Don't trust him too much.

1122
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:47,604
If you push someone
and they go on to make a triple…

1123
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:50,065
This is a game of give and take,
continuously rolling.

1124
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:53,735
See, there are a few places like that.
One here and another here.

1125
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:55,529
-Could you please step back?
-Oh, okay.

1126
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:59,825
Now, let me reveal the board
that will be used in the main game.

1127
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:01,451
It changes?

1128
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:03,537
-Damn it.
-Hey, that's not fair.

1129
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,831
Come on out.
Now is not the time for all that.

1130
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:07,958
They switch it out
as soon as practice ends.

1131
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:09,209
Isn't that too cruel?

1132
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:13,130
What? You made two of these?

1133
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:15,966
Gosh, I'm flabbergasted.
This is unbelievable.

1134
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:18,677
Wow, it got so much longer.

1135
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,262
I never saw that coming.

1136
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:21,763
Look for the shortest route.

1137
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:22,681
Amazing.

1138
00:52:22,764 --> 00:52:24,307
There are so many white squares.

1139
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:25,600
Too many white squares.

1140
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:26,768
It's gotten even bigger.

1141
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:30,438
The game will start in an hour.

1142
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:33,358
Spend this time as you wish.

1143
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:36,987
A lot more things have popped up
around the goal square.

1144
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:39,281
Why am I seeing so much white?

1145
00:52:39,364 --> 00:52:42,242
Exactly.
One, two, three, and four are longer.

1146
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:45,871
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven.

1147
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:47,956
The ones on longer routes
will have to be sacrificed,

1148
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:51,001
especially starting square 2,
since there are white squares in the way.

1149
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:52,669
-Unless you go around…
-Three white here.

1150
00:52:54,796 --> 00:52:58,633
Are there any rules regarding your color
when you enter the goal square?

1151
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:01,094
For example,
if white faces up when entering the goal,

1152
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:03,263
are you exiled and sent back to restart?

1153
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:05,015
I am not at liberty to discuss that.

1154
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:07,559
Let's just go to our room
and talk it over.

1155
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:14,941
It seems they're an alliance.

1156
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:17,569
They formed an alliance.

1157
00:53:17,652 --> 00:53:20,071
But the prison players
are sharing intel, too.

1158
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:22,949
I'm sharing as well.
They didn't seem particularly wary.

1159
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:27,662
Actually, I think it would be better
to openly gather information now.

1160
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:30,165
I think it would be best
to get a few people together,

1161
00:53:30,248 --> 00:53:32,626
-even if we don't all team up.
-I'll be back.

1162
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:33,960
It's red.

1163
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:37,631
So, this is red.
You have your die like this with red up.

1164
00:53:38,256 --> 00:53:40,425
Who are you planning to play with?

1165
00:53:40,508 --> 00:53:42,052
-Pretty much alone.
-Playing alone?

1166
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:43,220
It's an individual game.

1167
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:45,847
We assumed
you would all be playing together.

1168
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:47,641
No, we're operating alone.

1169
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:49,893
It's all falling apart.

1170
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:51,937
Yeah, I didn't see that coming.

1171
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,438
How many rules have you found?

1172
00:53:53,521 --> 00:53:55,774
Five. Well, six, including the exile rule.

1173
00:53:55,857 --> 00:53:57,525
What are those six?

1174
00:53:57,609 --> 00:53:58,985
Well, I think we all agree on the six.

1175
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:00,737
Changing the top color of the counter,

1176
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:02,948
pushing one the same color as me,

1177
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:06,117
pushing one of any color,
and me moving one square,

1178
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:07,452
along with the exile one.

1179
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:11,456
But do we fully understand
the trigger conditions? I'm not sure.

1180
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:13,583
We'll gain certainty as we play.

1181
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:16,378
Exiled if white faces up
or if the square is white.

1182
00:54:16,461 --> 00:54:19,673
Next, if you're exiled three times,
you lose three Pieces.

1183
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:22,175
Do you think
that's included in the eight rules?

1184
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:24,719
Yeah. It'll probably be revealed
first or second.

1185
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:25,929
Changing the face color.

1186
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:30,684
Change the face color of my counter
if none of the surrounding colors match.

1187
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:32,060
That's two, right?

1188
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:32,978
Yes.

1189
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:35,105
Maybe one about moving someone else's?

1190
00:54:35,188 --> 00:54:39,234
I remember this as either one
where you move your own or nothing at all.

1191
00:54:39,317 --> 00:54:41,945
When Hyun-joon did this,
he moved his own counter one square.

1192
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:43,113
Right, just your own.

1193
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:48,118
Diagonal or adjacent,
it's also possible if there are three.

1194
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:51,746
You have to have three of the same color
to move someone else's counter.

1195
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:53,039
If there are three,

1196
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:58,712
you move the counter of someone else
who is the same color as me.

1197
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:00,380
If they're all in a row,

1198
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:03,258
then you get to move yours as well
as a benefit.

1199
00:55:03,341 --> 00:55:05,468
Right, it's you and someone else.

1200
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:07,595
But that second configuration,

1201
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:11,016
I think someone
also moved themselves once,

1202
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:12,392
but I'm unsure about that.

1203
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:14,811
It's just the same color sometimes,

1204
00:55:14,894 --> 00:55:16,146
but it's any color for others.

1205
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:19,357
When it was three straight yellows,
we could move anything.

1206
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:22,444
You're right.
When your head faces the front.

1207
00:55:22,527 --> 00:55:25,822
But isn't it difficult to make a rule
about the direction you're facing?

1208
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:26,740
It's too specific.

1209
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:29,743
I think it's just about
figuring out the surroundings.

1210
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:32,787
These are the hidden rules
the two alliances are certain of.

1211
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:36,875
If your white side faces up or if you land
on a white square, you are exiled.

1212
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:40,045
If you are exiled three times,
you lose three Pieces.

1213
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:42,630
If your color does not match any
of the eight surrounding squares,

1214
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:44,257
you must change your color.

1215
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:46,676
However, they still seem unsure about

1216
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:50,722
the rules for moving someone else
or moving their own a second time.

1217
00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:53,016
There is also still confusion

1218
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:55,310
about the direction the head faces.

1219
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:58,355
Has Ji-yeong gone to the other team?
That makes six against six.

1220
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:00,607
Wait, but why did that happen?

1221
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:03,318
She hasn't switched teams.
She just went to gather intel.

1222
00:56:03,401 --> 00:56:04,903
That could be it.

1223
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:08,490
Even if it isn't, the numbers must mean--

1224
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:14,621
Gosh. Here you all are.

1225
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:17,415
I cheered so hard for you
in the death match.

1226
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:18,625
Do you know why, though?

1227
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:20,543
We're here for all this tasty food.

1228
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:21,503
We're hungry.

1229
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:23,546
We've just gathered to eat something.

1230
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:25,507
You're quick with the excuses, Eun-yu.

1231
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:28,259
You've been through a lot.
Let's all do our best today.

1232
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:29,677
How many eliminations today?

1233
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:31,721
Well, the prize mission calls for one.

1234
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:34,516
I personally think
there will be more than one.

1235
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:38,686
In total, each of us only has like
a one in ten chance of winning the money.

1236
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:41,064
So personally,
I hope we all just get through today.

1237
00:56:41,147 --> 00:56:43,316
Kyuhyun, hurry up.

1238
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,943
I was just chatting.

1239
00:56:45,026 --> 00:56:46,569
They gave you nothing, right?

1240
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:47,862
It was nothing like that.

1241
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:50,031
Just how nice it'd be if no one went home.

1242
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:52,742
I guess we couldn't avoid
this being a team match.

1243
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:57,497
We really need to consider
ganging up on one person to kill them.

1244
00:56:58,706 --> 00:57:01,167
If we kill one person, we can be at ease.

1245
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:03,878
Because unless you're stupid,
you won't kill anyone else.

1246
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:07,549
If we kill someone on their team first,

1247
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:09,175
it'll be a huge loss missing more.

1248
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:10,927
Because we lose the prize money.

1249
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:13,430
Your team is planning on
eliminating someone, right?

1250
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:15,765
No. I told them we shouldn't.

1251
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:17,183
I suppose you can do that.

1252
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:19,269
I swear that's what I said.
They all agreed.

1253
00:57:19,352 --> 00:57:22,480
He said that they would not play
to eliminate someone

1254
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:23,898
to guarantee the prize money.

1255
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:25,692
They would just play it safe.

1256
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:28,445
They think we're going to try
to eliminate one of them

1257
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:29,863
because we want the prize money.

1258
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:31,614
No! How could they think that?

1259
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:33,575
It'd really be a bloodbath.

1260
00:57:33,658 --> 00:57:36,578
But since it's likely
to end up in a bloodbath,

1261
00:57:36,661 --> 00:57:40,415
one of the players with four Pieces
may go on a frenzied sword dance.

1262
00:57:40,498 --> 00:57:43,626
"A sword dance"?
We don't even have any swords.

1263
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:47,297
Eun-yu, you have a point.
There are four of us who could do that.

1264
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:49,299
To be honest,
that would be to our benefit.

1265
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:50,550
But we won't.

1266
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:52,260
Then, who will go to prison?

1267
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:55,680
The half of the players
who have the least Pieces goes.

1268
00:57:55,763 --> 00:57:56,973
Everyone with just one.

1269
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:59,517
So, is the prison group
okay with all that?

1270
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:01,227
Even when you don't have any Pieces?

1271
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:05,648
Why is everyone silent?

1272
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:10,195
Anyone with one Piece
will inevitably end up in prison.

1273
00:58:10,278 --> 00:58:14,782
It seemed like he had the same concerns
as if we were on the same page.

1274
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:18,161
We had the same concerns but were
in totally different positions, so…

1275
00:58:18,244 --> 00:58:20,079
Let me say one thing.

1276
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:24,083
The four of us with more Pieces
can support the other two.

1277
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:27,295
So let's try to help them
get first or second place.

1278
00:58:27,378 --> 00:58:28,671
By doing that,

1279
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:30,924
first place gets three Pieces
and goes with us.

1280
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:32,592
And second to fifth places gets one Piece.

1281
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:35,845
Then, it'll be up to us
to choose one player again.

1282
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:37,639
Then, we can all stay together.

1283
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:38,556
So let's push for that.

1284
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,850
-I'm in. I'm good with that.
-Not bad, right?

1285
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:42,310
We'd be grateful.

1286
00:58:42,393 --> 00:58:44,646
No reason for us to turn that down.

1287
00:58:44,729 --> 00:58:48,525
Great! Then let's do that.
And Ji-yeong would be included as well.

1288
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:51,486
I've thought about this,
and the people with four Pieces

1289
00:58:51,569 --> 00:58:55,156
-We can't take one of them.
-have such different viewpoints.

1290
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,199
There are six of us…

1291
00:58:56,282 --> 00:58:59,452
Because if we play it safe,
we're headed to prison.

1292
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:01,162
We were setting it up for six of us,

1293
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:03,748
but Ji-yeong rejoined us
right at the end, so…

1294
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:05,291
Whoever is first will decide.

1295
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,710
Since only six of us can go,

1296
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:10,922
we'll have to jettison someone
at some point, so…

1297
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,301
Figure out starting squares?

1298
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:17,053
I'm going to start from square 10.

1299
00:59:17,136 --> 00:59:19,722
I'm thinking of starting from square 8.

1300
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:22,809
If we figured it out correctly,
I think I can finish it in no time.

1301
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:24,310
The numbers only gave a score.

1302
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:27,313
Square 1 leads to a blue and green triple.

1303
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:30,275
Square 2 leads to a blue and green triple.

1304
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:32,610
Square 3 leads to a yellow triple.

1305
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:34,112
If we get our timing right,

1306
00:59:34,195 --> 00:59:36,531
we could push someone
three, four squares in one go.

1307
00:59:36,614 --> 00:59:39,158
Since it finishes as soon
as someone reaches the goal square,

1308
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:41,494
it's definitely an advantage to go first.

1309
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:45,498
Your time is up.
Please gather in the hall.

1310
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:47,792
Unknown will begin now.

1311
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:52,547
Now, please place your counter
on a starting square of your choice.

1312
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:55,800
If multiple players desire
the same starting square,

1313
00:59:55,883 --> 00:59:58,511
please discuss it amongst yourselves
to decide who gets it.

1314
00:59:58,595 --> 00:59:59,596
Oh, square 8.

1315
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:01,556
That's an excellent start.

1316
01:00:12,483 --> 01:00:13,985
Where do I go now?

1317
01:00:14,068 --> 01:00:15,695
Sang-yeon is going there?

1318
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:17,655
Why? Is it bad?

1319
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:19,198
No, just saying.

1320
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:21,868
If you make it yellow next,
it'll be double yellow.

1321
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:23,745
Would there be a benefit to that?

1322
01:00:23,828 --> 01:00:24,912
Was there such a rule?

1323
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:26,581
Wait a sec, wasn't there?

1324
01:00:26,664 --> 01:00:28,791
Where's Kyuhyun?
Hey, we need a rule check.

1325
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:31,336
Do we get to move
if there are two of the same color?

1326
01:00:31,419 --> 01:00:33,171
Didn't someone say that?

1327
01:00:33,254 --> 01:00:36,966
But the head has to be pointing
in the right direction, right?

1328
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:39,177
-Is the direction you're facing important?
-Yes.

1329
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:41,638
-Oh, really?
-That will make it way too complicated.

1330
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:45,308
It's with color. You do it with color.
The direction you're facing is irrelevant.

1331
01:00:52,732 --> 01:00:56,152
All players have
chosen their starting squares.

1332
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:01,616
The game will begin

1333
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:04,327
with Tinno, the player who is
on the lowest number square.

1334
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:07,830
-I'm so nervous.
-I will move to 21.

1335
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:10,041
-Moving to square 21.
-Yes.

1336
01:01:10,541 --> 01:01:13,461
Please choose
a different color to face up.

1337
01:01:13,544 --> 01:01:15,588
Putting it like this…

1338
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,131
I'll go with this.

1339
01:01:18,299 --> 01:01:19,759
-Is this correct?
-Yes, sir!

1340
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:25,890
Kyuhyun is next.

1341
01:01:25,973 --> 01:01:27,517
I will move to 22.

1342
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:29,811
Moving to square 22.

1343
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:34,399
Nothing for the color.

1344
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:36,317
See. Nothing. Double is nothing.

1345
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:37,944
There's no rule about two same colors.

1346
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:39,028
Why did it happen then?

1347
01:01:39,112 --> 01:01:41,864
It might be
because of the color underneath.

1348
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:43,199
Okay.

1349
01:01:43,282 --> 01:01:44,867
Jeong Hyun-gyu is next.

1350
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:46,869
I will move to 23.

1351
01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:48,746
Moving to square 23.

1352
01:01:54,585 --> 01:01:55,878
There's no such rule.

1353
01:01:56,796 --> 01:01:58,423
There's nothing
about two facing each other.

1354
01:01:58,506 --> 01:02:01,718
Your head has to face the right way,
toward the blue.

1355
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:03,344
But Kyuhyun's didn't work either.

1356
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:04,887
Really? Why didn't it?

1357
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:05,888
I guess it doesn't.

1358
01:02:06,472 --> 01:02:08,099
There are two but nothing.

1359
01:02:08,182 --> 01:02:10,268
Yeah, I thought that would induce a move.

1360
01:02:10,351 --> 01:02:13,062
No, this is weird.
We were wrong about that.

1361
01:02:14,105 --> 01:02:16,023
Kim Ha-rin is next.

1362
01:02:16,107 --> 01:02:17,984
I will move to 46.

1363
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:19,777
-Moving to square 46.
-Okay.

1364
01:02:22,613 --> 01:02:24,449
I guess there's nothing for two.

1365
01:02:24,532 --> 01:02:26,242
I guess it has to be three?

1366
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:27,785
I guess.

1367
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:29,495
Son Eun-yu is next.

1368
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:31,998
I will move to 44.

1369
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:33,666
Moving to square 44.

1370
01:02:36,377 --> 01:02:37,378
7high is next.

1371
01:02:37,462 --> 01:02:39,005
I will move to 50.

1372
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:40,506
Moving to square 50.

1373
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:45,636
Please select a purple player
and move their counter one square.

1374
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:46,929
All right.

1375
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:49,849
Currently, Justin Min is
the only purple player.

1376
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:51,309
Okay.

1377
01:02:51,392 --> 01:02:52,852
Please choose a direction.

1378
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:53,936
Forward.

1379
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:55,563
Moving to square 57.

1380
01:02:58,024 --> 01:03:01,569
Even if he doesn't want to move,
he has no choice.

1381
01:03:01,652 --> 01:03:04,197
In that situation,
shouldn't he get to move his, too?

1382
01:03:05,865 --> 01:03:07,241
I'll make a note of that.

1383
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:08,326
Why didn't he get one?

1384
01:03:08,409 --> 01:03:09,410
We've got a problem.

1385
01:03:09,494 --> 01:03:12,371
7high didn't get to a move
even though it was in an L shape.

1386
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:13,581
I said he wouldn't.

1387
01:03:13,664 --> 01:03:15,541
He doesn't. Only when it's in the middle.

1388
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:16,834
You said he wouldn't?

1389
01:03:17,335 --> 01:03:19,879
I'm going to go here.

1390
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:21,923
-Moving towards 7high.
-Yes.

1391
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:27,053
I guess there's nothing for two.

1392
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:29,806
Ji-yeong is purple.
They didn't get anything, either.

1393
01:03:30,515 --> 01:03:32,141
Maybe we got it wrong?

1394
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:33,309
It seems so.

1395
01:03:33,392 --> 01:03:34,644
Lee Se-dol is next.

1396
01:03:34,727 --> 01:03:36,687
I will move to 27.

1397
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:38,689
My mistake. I meant 64.

1398
01:03:38,773 --> 01:03:41,150
-Moving to square 64.
-I was looking at that other one…

1399
01:03:43,277 --> 01:03:44,529
Yoon So-hui is next.

1400
01:03:44,612 --> 01:03:48,658
I will move to 65. That makes three blues.

1401
01:03:48,741 --> 01:03:49,909
-It's not.
-Moving to square 65.

1402
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:51,702
There are three blue ones. There too.

1403
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:52,954
-No.
-No?

1404
01:03:53,037 --> 01:03:54,872
The eight squares surrounding you.

1405
01:03:56,749 --> 01:03:59,252
-You mean, I should be at the center.
-That's right.

1406
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:00,670
Park Sang-yeon is next.

1407
01:04:00,753 --> 01:04:02,255
I will move to 59.

1408
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:04,006
Moving to square 59.

1409
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:12,473
But wasn't there something for two?

1410
01:04:12,557 --> 01:04:14,725
-I didn't get anything, either.
-Really?

1411
01:04:14,809 --> 01:04:16,227
Maybe different for each color?

1412
01:04:16,769 --> 01:04:19,313
Maybe it just works
for green or something?

1413
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:21,566
We can confirm it by watching Hyun-joon.

1414
01:04:21,649 --> 01:04:22,733
That should be possible.

1415
01:04:22,817 --> 01:04:23,943
Choi Hyun-joon.

1416
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:26,279
Yes, I will roll to square 52.

1417
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:28,072
-Moving to square 52.
-Okay.

1418
01:04:28,614 --> 01:04:29,615
Choi Hyun-joon,

1419
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:32,743
please select a green player
and move their counter one square.

1420
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:36,414
By color. See. But see here,
if no one was that color…

1421
01:04:36,497 --> 01:04:38,291
I think it worked for purple as well.

1422
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:41,335
Then it doesn't work for red or yellow,
but it does for purple.

1423
01:04:41,419 --> 01:04:43,880
Mine's green. Push mine.

1424
01:04:43,963 --> 01:04:45,715
Okay then. You can push me later.

1425
01:04:45,798 --> 01:04:47,925
-I push you, you push me later.
-Okay.

1426
01:04:48,009 --> 01:04:50,136
I will push Ha-rin to square 73.

1427
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:52,263
Moving Kim Ha-rin to square 73.

1428
01:04:55,016 --> 01:04:56,934
-You have to return the favor.
-Of course.

1429
01:04:57,685 --> 01:05:00,771
Then, how do I get one extra move,
just for myself?

1430
01:05:00,855 --> 01:05:03,065
Se-dol thinks

1431
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:05,985
you need make triple
in straight line with these.

1432
01:05:06,068 --> 01:05:08,237
I told you that it's about the head.

1433
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:10,489
You were facing the right way,
toward the color.

1434
01:05:10,573 --> 01:05:12,450
Justin Min is next.

1435
01:05:12,533 --> 01:05:15,870
I will go to 83.

1436
01:05:19,957 --> 01:05:21,375
By the way,

1437
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:24,170
Sang-yeon and Justin
might get pushed over.

1438
01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:25,546
One, two, three, four, five…

1439
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:27,340
That concludes Round 1.

1440
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:28,549
That was quick.

1441
01:05:28,633 --> 01:05:31,302
Here is the first hidden rule.

1442
01:05:31,385 --> 01:05:32,553
What could it be?

1443
01:05:34,722 --> 01:05:35,806
What the heck? So long.

1444
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:36,807
As expected.

1445
01:05:36,891 --> 01:05:39,393
COUNTER THAT IS ON A WHITE SQUARE
OR HAS ITS WHITE FACE UP IS EXILED

1446
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:42,480
YOU CANNOT RETURN TO A STARTING SQUARE
UNLESS YOU ARE EXILED

1447
01:05:42,563 --> 01:05:43,731
Obvious first reveal.

1448
01:05:43,814 --> 01:05:45,191
Hey, we already knew that.

1449
01:05:45,274 --> 01:05:46,734
We knew that, indeed.

1450
01:05:46,817 --> 01:05:48,694
Round 2 will now begin.

1451
01:05:49,236 --> 01:05:52,114
Tinno, it is your turn.
Please choose your direction.

1452
01:05:52,198 --> 01:05:54,283
I will move to 25.

1453
01:05:54,367 --> 01:05:56,118
Moving to square 25.

1454
01:05:59,038 --> 01:06:00,289
Why did I place it that way?

1455
01:06:01,499 --> 01:06:03,209
What is it? What happened?

1456
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:04,460
The next color facing up is white.

1457
01:06:04,543 --> 01:06:07,254
I thought I put it on the side earlier.
On this side.

1458
01:06:07,338 --> 01:06:09,006
Then, exile is inevitable.

1459
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:10,132
Kyuhyun is next.

1460
01:06:10,216 --> 01:06:12,259
I will move one square forward to 26.

1461
01:06:12,343 --> 01:06:13,970
Moving to square 26.

1462
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:17,056
Now, we can see how a triple works.

1463
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:21,519
Kyuhyun, please select a blue player
to move one square,

1464
01:06:21,602 --> 01:06:23,646
and then yours as well.

1465
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:26,315
Which counter would you like to move?

1466
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:31,195
Where do you want to go?

1467
01:06:31,278 --> 01:06:32,780
-I'd choose 100 for sure.
-Me too.

1468
01:06:32,863 --> 01:06:36,325
Then, I will move him to 100.

1469
01:06:36,409 --> 01:06:39,453
Moving 7high's counter to square 100.

1470
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:42,415
Moving green?

1471
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:46,961
7high, please select a green player
and move their counter one square.

1472
01:06:47,044 --> 01:06:49,672
Kid, don't you think
you need to move a square?

1473
01:06:49,755 --> 01:06:50,589
Of course.

1474
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:52,383
-Of course, I'll go.
-Kid.

1475
01:06:52,466 --> 01:06:53,592
To which square?

1476
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:55,720
Please push him to 84.

1477
01:06:55,803 --> 01:06:57,430
Moving to square 84.

1478
01:06:57,513 --> 01:07:00,474
We didn't pay enough attention
to our connections. Ran out of time.

1479
01:07:00,558 --> 01:07:04,645
We didn't have time for that.
Nor were we certain of the rules.

1480
01:07:04,729 --> 01:07:07,189
Kyuhyun, please move
your counter one more square.

1481
01:07:08,149 --> 01:07:09,025
I will go back.

1482
01:07:09,108 --> 01:07:10,776
Moving to square 22.

1483
01:07:11,902 --> 01:07:12,987
Jeong Hyun-gyu is next.

1484
01:07:13,070 --> 01:07:15,156
I will move one square forward to 27.

1485
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:16,949
Moving to square 27.

1486
01:07:18,492 --> 01:07:20,953
Please choose
a different color to face up.

1487
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:22,705
I will go with this.

1488
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:24,540
-Is that it?
-Yes.

1489
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:27,460
Kim Ha-rin is next.

1490
01:07:27,543 --> 01:07:30,254
Yes, I will move to 96.

1491
01:07:30,337 --> 01:07:32,798
-Moving Kim Ha-rin to square 96.
-Yes.

1492
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:35,593
Son Eun-yu is next.

1493
01:07:35,676 --> 01:07:37,386
I will move to 72.

1494
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:38,888
Moving to the purple square.

1495
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:42,099
Please choose
a different color to face up.

1496
01:07:42,183 --> 01:07:43,350
So, it's changing here.

1497
01:07:44,351 --> 01:07:46,312
So, the color of the square changes

1498
01:07:46,395 --> 01:07:47,605
from yellow to purple.

1499
01:07:49,106 --> 01:07:51,817
Wait, I shouldn't have changed color here.
Hang on.

1500
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:54,278
When you get to 116,
what color will you be? Yellow?

1501
01:07:54,361 --> 01:07:55,404
Yes, yellow.

1502
01:07:55,488 --> 01:07:59,283
So if you come here and push me,
that will be good for me.

1503
01:07:59,366 --> 01:08:03,037
If it's three greens,
do I get to move regardless of direction?

1504
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:04,455
Eun-yu,

1505
01:08:04,538 --> 01:08:08,626
if you go here with green,
you can push anybody one square.

1506
01:08:08,709 --> 01:08:12,671
Then you can come here
as yellow and push me that way.

1507
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:13,881
Good. Okay.

1508
01:08:13,964 --> 01:08:15,257
Like that? Go?

1509
01:08:15,341 --> 01:08:18,052
-If you finish first, give me a Piece.
-Okay.

1510
01:08:18,135 --> 01:08:20,346
With blue on top and green…

1511
01:08:20,429 --> 01:08:22,223
-Is this correct?
-Yes, please change it to that.

1512
01:08:23,265 --> 01:08:24,850
7high is next.

1513
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:26,435
Please take me to 119.

1514
01:08:26,519 --> 01:08:28,270
-Moving to square 119.
-Yes.

1515
01:08:30,815 --> 01:08:33,651
So I've figured something out
about the top color changing.

1516
01:08:33,734 --> 01:08:38,239
If there are three of them, I move
another player who's the same color as me.

1517
01:08:38,322 --> 01:08:40,282
If they're in a straight line,
I get to move, too.

1518
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:42,952
And now,
moving someone regardless of their color…

1519
01:08:43,035 --> 01:08:45,162
-We don't know yet.
-I'm not sure about it.

1520
01:08:45,246 --> 01:08:47,623
Is everyone on the same page?

1521
01:08:47,706 --> 01:08:49,166
Kang Ji-yeong is next.

1522
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:51,627
I will go to 77.

1523
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:53,504
Moving to square 77.

1524
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:56,090
Two?

1525
01:08:56,674 --> 01:09:00,219
-But for two of them…
-There are times when it doesn't work.

1526
01:09:00,302 --> 01:09:01,178
No head direction?

1527
01:09:01,262 --> 01:09:03,139
No, the head doesn't affect anything.

1528
01:09:03,222 --> 01:09:04,348
Lee Se-dol is next.

1529
01:09:06,225 --> 01:09:07,434
It's my turn, right?

1530
01:09:08,435 --> 01:09:10,855
I will go to 89.

1531
01:09:10,938 --> 01:09:12,648
-Moving to square 89.
-Yes.

1532
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:18,904
Please select a blue player
and move their counter one square,

1533
01:09:18,988 --> 01:09:20,281
and then yours as well.

1534
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:23,993
Hang on a second. Now that I look…

1535
01:09:24,076 --> 01:09:24,994
What is it?

1536
01:09:25,077 --> 01:09:26,954
When there are two, you move someone else.

1537
01:09:27,037 --> 01:09:29,248
When there are three nearby,

1538
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:30,916
you move someone else and yourself.

1539
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,168
If there are three?

1540
01:09:32,251 --> 01:09:33,752
-You can make a move, too.
-Three?

1541
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:35,337
Yes, three in the vicinity.

1542
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:36,797
Not straight three?

1543
01:09:37,923 --> 01:09:40,676
But this isn't bingo, either.
Three of them right now.

1544
01:09:40,759 --> 01:09:42,803
It's bingo. Diagonally.

1545
01:09:42,887 --> 01:09:45,264
There is. So that's why he's going too.

1546
01:09:45,347 --> 01:09:46,765
Who is this?

1547
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:48,100
Who is this?

1548
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:50,769
That's me. Can't you tell?

1549
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:53,772
But if you move that, I will die.
You can't.

1550
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:54,857
Then, now…

1551
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:56,901
Who is this?

1552
01:09:56,984 --> 01:10:00,154
-It's Ji-yeong.
-Ji-yeong? I see.

1553
01:10:00,237 --> 01:10:02,156
It'll either be Ji-yeong or So-hui.

1554
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:06,076
I'll have to move this one.
I won't be able to move that one.

1555
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:07,745
Where should I move it?

1556
01:10:08,913 --> 01:10:10,456
I'll move it to 100.

1557
01:10:10,539 --> 01:10:12,208
-Kang Ji-yeong's counter?
-Yes.

1558
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:13,626
Moving to square 100.

1559
01:10:14,919 --> 01:10:17,213
-Thank you.
-But who are you?

1560
01:10:17,296 --> 01:10:18,839
Please move your own counter again.

1561
01:10:18,923 --> 01:10:20,549
You have to move yourself too.

1562
01:10:20,633 --> 01:10:21,926
Yes, I will go to 88.

1563
01:10:22,009 --> 01:10:23,510
Moving to square 88.

1564
01:10:25,554 --> 01:10:28,432
Please choose
a different color to face up.

1565
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:39,568
I will change it to red.

1566
01:10:40,778 --> 01:10:42,029
-Is this correct?
-Yes.

1567
01:10:45,324 --> 01:10:49,954
Please select a red player
to move their counter one square.

1568
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:54,250
You can do this.

1569
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:56,460
Do I have to push that?

1570
01:10:56,543 --> 01:11:00,464
Don't push it to the white.
Can you just push it back one square?

1571
01:11:00,547 --> 01:11:01,632
To somewhere like 101.

1572
01:11:01,715 --> 01:11:04,176
But if he goes to 101,
he'll also be white.

1573
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:07,221
There's nothing else I can do.
I have to move a red player, right?

1574
01:11:07,304 --> 01:11:09,640
If you want to push this one,
you can't do either way.

1575
01:11:09,723 --> 01:11:12,309
It's backwards only,
but Ji-yeong will be forced back, too.

1576
01:11:12,393 --> 01:11:13,560
There's also the fact

1577
01:11:13,644 --> 01:11:17,564
that the competition for first place
is between Ha-rin and 7high.

1578
01:11:17,648 --> 01:11:20,067
Then, I'll push him to 101.

1579
01:11:20,150 --> 01:11:21,026
Pushed.

1580
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:22,444
-Someone pushed me?
-Yes.

1581
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:24,655
-Is it happening?
-They're talking about it.

1582
01:11:24,738 --> 01:11:26,532
-Hey now.
-Are you going to push me?

1583
01:11:26,615 --> 01:11:28,367
What now? Are you going to do it?

1584
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:30,119
-The thing is…
-Trying to avoid exile.

1585
01:11:30,202 --> 01:11:33,038
But you're both on the shortest route…

1586
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:34,164
I can't do nothing.

1587
01:11:34,248 --> 01:11:36,417
…you can't be happy in this situation.

1588
01:11:39,962 --> 01:11:42,006
A fight is brewing. Oh, no!

1589
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:46,802
Well, I'll hold off on reacting
until after you make your move.

1590
01:11:46,885 --> 01:11:48,137
Sure, go ahead.

1591
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:49,888
I will exile him then.

1592
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:52,016
But what's the justification for this?

1593
01:11:52,099 --> 01:11:54,518
7high, you have been exiled.

1594
01:11:54,601 --> 01:11:56,562
But what's the justification here?

1595
01:11:56,645 --> 01:11:58,939
-Is it just a declaration of war?
-You will be given one exile token.

1596
01:11:59,023 --> 01:12:00,441
I'll give you one exile sticker.

1597
01:12:00,983 --> 01:12:03,110
It's just war at this point.

1598
01:12:03,193 --> 01:12:07,531
I mean, there's not
even a crossing of paths, so why me?

1599
01:12:08,741 --> 01:12:10,200
-Exactly.
-I knew it.

1600
01:12:10,284 --> 01:12:11,160
7high, please move your…

1601
01:12:11,243 --> 01:12:12,870
That's why I asked you in advance.

1602
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:14,872
-I…
-Hold on, but…

1603
01:12:14,955 --> 01:12:17,624
No, I think we're done here.

1604
01:12:17,708 --> 01:12:20,836
Se-dol had me feeling anxious

1605
01:12:20,919 --> 01:12:24,715
because he keeps
causing trouble with other people.

1606
01:12:24,798 --> 01:12:26,258
He is a really great person, but…

1607
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:29,720
I told you. From where they stand,
they have to do this to survive.

1608
01:12:29,803 --> 01:12:33,515
I was targeting
the four people with four Pieces,

1609
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:35,768
but that was practically impossible.

1610
01:12:35,851 --> 01:12:38,354
So I had no choice but to hit 7high.

1611
01:12:39,855 --> 01:12:41,065
I'm going to take a second.

1612
01:12:41,148 --> 01:12:44,026
Because this all happened so suddenly.

1613
01:12:44,109 --> 01:12:46,528
-Hey, you're also in danger.
-I know.

1614
01:12:47,446 --> 01:12:48,655
Se-dol…

1615
01:12:49,615 --> 01:12:50,991
Seriously.

1616
01:12:51,075 --> 01:12:52,201
What is it?

1617
01:12:52,743 --> 01:12:55,162
We were planning
to push Ha-rin to finish first.

1618
01:12:55,245 --> 01:12:58,082
It was neck and neck
between her and 7high,

1619
01:12:58,165 --> 01:13:00,125
so we just needed
to push him back one square.

1620
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:02,795
I was going to go for it if I could,

1621
01:13:02,878 --> 01:13:04,213
but you pushed Ha-rin.

1622
01:13:04,296 --> 01:13:06,882
Ha-rin edged ahead,
so I decided to push for her as well.

1623
01:13:06,965 --> 01:13:09,843
If we had just pushed him back,
he would've still been in contention,

1624
01:13:09,927 --> 01:13:11,929
but now we're in big trouble.

1625
01:13:14,264 --> 01:13:16,892
Now, you just have to win.

1626
01:13:16,975 --> 01:13:21,522
I'm looking at where I should start
if I want the most points.

1627
01:13:21,605 --> 01:13:23,065
How can I do that?

1628
01:13:23,148 --> 01:13:24,983
Sang-yeon, when do you finish?

1629
01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:26,735
Six more squares.

1630
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:27,986
-Six squares?
-Yes.

1631
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:32,324
How about starting from 5,
so you can finish on a high number?

1632
01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:33,325
-Square 5?
-Yes.

1633
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:36,161
-You're saying, head for 111, 112?
-Yeah, exactly.

1634
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:38,622
Then, you'll have a high number,
so you won't die.

1635
01:13:39,748 --> 01:13:41,041
I've made my decision.

1636
01:13:42,876 --> 01:13:45,963
Place it down carefully.

1637
01:13:46,046 --> 01:13:47,631
This is my lifeline.

1638
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:49,383
I've placed it.

1639
01:13:49,883 --> 01:13:51,510
Yoon So-hui is next.

1640
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:54,263
Is it our turn? Not yet, right?

1641
01:13:54,346 --> 01:13:56,765
It's me.
I think he'll finish first at this rate.

1642
01:13:56,849 --> 01:13:58,767
-Who?
-Se-dol.

1643
01:13:58,851 --> 01:14:01,645
-Are we going to let that happen?
-If we interfere…

1644
01:14:01,728 --> 01:14:03,605
Right, if we interfere.

1645
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:07,276
Hey, can we have a quick chat?

1646
01:14:07,359 --> 01:14:09,278
Are you considering retaliating?

1647
01:14:09,361 --> 01:14:10,904
That's what we're talking about.

1648
01:14:10,988 --> 01:14:13,073
Well, not elimination, just pushing…

1649
01:14:13,157 --> 01:14:16,368
I think we can even go
as far as eliminating them.

1650
01:14:16,452 --> 01:14:18,787
Because he could've moved Hyun-gyu,

1651
01:14:18,871 --> 01:14:20,664
so it had to be intentional.

1652
01:14:20,747 --> 01:14:24,126
I know. He pushed me
because I might finish first.

1653
01:14:24,209 --> 01:14:27,629
But now that it's come to this,
a few more options have opened up.

1654
01:14:29,548 --> 01:14:30,466
Red.

1655
01:14:33,135 --> 01:14:34,303
Hang on.

1656
01:14:38,807 --> 01:14:42,102
So-hui, just go two squares
to the side and fill in the red.

1657
01:14:42,186 --> 01:14:45,022
So, if you go purple and the next square,
you'll have a double red.

1658
01:14:45,105 --> 01:14:47,024
You'll be in Se-dol's current position.

1659
01:14:47,107 --> 01:14:49,818
When you're where Se-dol is now,
you can push a red too.

1660
01:14:49,902 --> 01:14:52,988
Yes, so go that way.
And we can fire off an attack of our own.

1661
01:14:53,071 --> 01:14:55,407
I will move to 89.

1662
01:14:55,491 --> 01:14:57,117
Moving to 89.

1663
01:15:00,078 --> 01:15:01,288
Park Sang-yeon is next.

1664
01:15:01,914 --> 01:15:03,832
I will move to 105.

1665
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:05,709
Moving to square 105.

1666
01:15:05,792 --> 01:15:09,338
Is Justin going to push you? Push him!

1667
01:15:09,421 --> 01:15:10,756
Choi Hyun-joon is next.

1668
01:15:10,839 --> 01:15:12,716
I will go to 79.

1669
01:15:12,799 --> 01:15:14,218
-Moving to square 79.
-Wait.

1670
01:15:15,969 --> 01:15:18,013
Hyun-joon didn't have a choice.

1671
01:15:27,606 --> 01:15:29,066
Push him. He'll die.

1672
01:15:30,108 --> 01:15:32,236
I will move to 82.

1673
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:37,241
Please choose
a different color to face up.

1674
01:15:37,324 --> 01:15:38,575
I'll do it like this.

1675
01:15:39,201 --> 01:15:40,410
-Is this correct?
-Yes.

1676
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:44,206
Yes.

1677
01:15:44,706 --> 01:15:46,959
That concludes Round 2.

1678
01:15:47,709 --> 01:15:50,337
Here is the second hidden rule.

1679
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:51,547
They're revealing it.

1680
01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:53,423
FIRST AND SECOND TO GET 3 EXILES
LOSE 3 PIECES

1681
01:15:53,507 --> 01:15:54,508
Told you! Exactly!

1682
01:15:54,591 --> 01:15:56,009
Got to give up three Pieces.

1683
01:15:56,093 --> 01:15:58,595
Doesn't that mean
the first two are subject to it

1684
01:15:58,679 --> 01:16:00,597
and the rest are fine?

1685
01:16:00,681 --> 01:16:04,309
So, a maximum of two players
could be eliminated during this game.

1686
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:06,353
Round 3 will now begin.

1687
01:16:06,979 --> 01:16:08,105
Tinno, it's your turn.

1688
01:16:08,188 --> 01:16:11,024
Okay, I will go to 29.

1689
01:16:11,108 --> 01:16:13,694
Moving to square 29.

1690
01:16:13,777 --> 01:16:14,820
You have been exiled.

1691
01:16:16,488 --> 01:16:17,322
Suicide…

1692
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:19,700
-The wrong spot.
-Exactly, that's what I was saying.

1693
01:16:19,783 --> 01:16:21,326
You will be given one exile token.

1694
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:22,286
Please stick it on.

1695
01:16:22,369 --> 01:16:23,704
Thank you.

1696
01:16:23,787 --> 01:16:25,831
So, that's what it looks like. Then…

1697
01:16:25,914 --> 01:16:28,041
I will place it here.

1698
01:16:28,625 --> 01:16:29,585
Kyuhyun is next.

1699
01:16:29,668 --> 01:16:31,670
I will move one square forward.

1700
01:16:31,753 --> 01:16:33,589
Moving to 26.

1701
01:16:34,881 --> 01:16:36,508
It'll probably work again, right?

1702
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:37,676
Not sure.

1703
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:39,177
So, let's wait for a moment.

1704
01:16:39,261 --> 01:16:44,099
Please select a blue player
and move their counter one square,

1705
01:16:44,182 --> 01:16:46,602
-This keeps working.
-and then yours as well.

1706
01:16:46,685 --> 01:16:48,645
It will keep going. It'll work forever.

1707
01:16:48,729 --> 01:16:50,439
It's never-ending.

1708
01:16:50,522 --> 01:16:51,815
Someone blue.

1709
01:16:51,898 --> 01:16:54,860
Hyun-joon or… Tinno.

1710
01:16:54,943 --> 01:16:56,194
Hyun-joon, where to?

1711
01:16:56,278 --> 01:16:57,988
Pushing Hyun-joon would be nice.

1712
01:16:58,071 --> 01:16:59,323
It has to be here.

1713
01:16:59,406 --> 01:17:02,534
Because this side is white. Is that okay?

1714
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:06,204
Then, I will move Hyun-joon to 80.

1715
01:17:06,288 --> 01:17:08,832
Moving to square 80.

1716
01:17:09,958 --> 01:17:14,880
Please select a purple player
and move their counter one square.

1717
01:17:14,963 --> 01:17:16,381
Push me.

1718
01:17:16,465 --> 01:17:18,300
-Then, I will move you to 115.
-Yeah, 115.

1719
01:17:18,383 --> 01:17:20,344
Please move Ha-rin to 115.

1720
01:17:20,427 --> 01:17:23,221
-Moving to square 115.
-Yes.

1721
01:17:24,348 --> 01:17:26,975
Who is this? Who's made it all this way?

1722
01:17:27,559 --> 01:17:28,560
It's Ha-rin.

1723
01:17:29,645 --> 01:17:31,813
Kyuhyun, please move
your counter one square.

1724
01:17:31,897 --> 01:17:33,357
I will go backward.

1725
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:35,108
Moving to 22.

1726
01:17:35,859 --> 01:17:36,985
Jeong Hyun-gyu is next.

1727
01:17:37,069 --> 01:17:39,237
I will go straight to 31.

1728
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:41,031
Moving to square 31.

1729
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:43,325
Please change your color.

1730
01:17:43,408 --> 01:17:44,451
To this, please.

1731
01:17:44,534 --> 01:17:45,369
Is this correct?

1732
01:17:45,452 --> 01:17:46,703
Yes, that's correct.

1733
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:49,873
Kim Ha-rin is next.

1734
01:17:49,956 --> 01:17:52,125
I will move to 116.

1735
01:17:52,209 --> 01:17:54,127
-Moving to square 116.
-Yes.

1736
01:17:56,713 --> 01:17:58,965
We need to win quickly. Wrap this up.

1737
01:17:59,049 --> 01:18:00,217
It's the only way.

1738
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:04,096
You wrap it up, and we'll get
our scores up as high as we can.

1739
01:18:04,179 --> 01:18:05,806
Watching my smooth ride,

1740
01:18:05,889 --> 01:18:10,435
I confirmed my strategy
was the quickest way to finish.

1741
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:14,272
If things go well, I might
even be able to aim for the win.

1742
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:18,235
I don't know about anything else,
but we have to push Ha-rin back.

1743
01:18:18,318 --> 01:18:20,404
She'll definitely win
if we don't do anything.

1744
01:18:20,487 --> 01:18:22,823
And we'll all end up
in the bottom half, see?

1745
01:18:22,906 --> 01:18:23,824
Yellow? Ha-rin?

1746
01:18:23,907 --> 01:18:26,660
Yes, if she gets in there, it's game over.

1747
01:18:26,743 --> 01:18:28,412
We can take our time with the rest,

1748
01:18:28,495 --> 01:18:30,330
but we cannot let that counter win.

1749
01:18:30,414 --> 01:18:31,623
We must push back.

1750
01:18:32,249 --> 01:18:34,584
Hyun-gyu is going to be yellow
on his next turn.

1751
01:18:34,668 --> 01:18:37,587
-Then he'll get to push another yellow?
-Yes, when he becomes yellow.

1752
01:18:37,671 --> 01:18:39,631
My turn is right after you.

1753
01:18:40,173 --> 01:18:41,133
Are you going to push her?

1754
01:18:41,216 --> 01:18:44,511
If you tell me to.
I was just talking with Kyuhyun.

1755
01:18:44,594 --> 01:18:46,930
Of course,
I don't want to get blood on my hands.

1756
01:18:47,013 --> 01:18:48,432
If you don't, she'll win.

1757
01:18:48,515 --> 01:18:49,975
Right, but we'll see.

1758
01:18:50,058 --> 01:18:52,060
We had to kill off Ha-rin,

1759
01:18:52,144 --> 01:18:53,729
but I didn't want to.

1760
01:18:53,812 --> 01:18:55,355
I didn't want to get involved.

1761
01:18:55,439 --> 01:18:56,606
Son Eun-yu is next.

1762
01:18:56,690 --> 01:18:58,775
I will move to 96.

1763
01:18:58,859 --> 01:19:01,111
-Moving to square 96.
-Yes.

1764
01:19:01,194 --> 01:19:05,824
Son Eun-yu, please select a green player
and move their counter one square,

1765
01:19:05,907 --> 01:19:07,576
and then yours as well.

1766
01:19:08,285 --> 01:19:09,578
I've been thinking.

1767
01:19:09,661 --> 01:19:13,373
If I help someone finish first,
I want to be rewarded with a Piece.

1768
01:19:13,457 --> 01:19:16,752
-But those three Pieces…
-Have you promised them to someone?

1769
01:19:16,835 --> 01:19:18,795
We haven't verbally agreed to anything.

1770
01:19:18,879 --> 01:19:20,005
-So, no agreement?
-No.

1771
01:19:20,088 --> 01:19:22,549
Then, can you help me bring the topic up?

1772
01:19:24,009 --> 01:19:27,220
I've been offered a deal
that would move me to 119.

1773
01:19:27,304 --> 01:19:30,223
Eun-yu can push a green,
and she has to decide.

1774
01:19:30,307 --> 01:19:32,768
If she pushes me, I'll go to 119.

1775
01:19:32,851 --> 01:19:34,352
-To which side?
-Let's see.

1776
01:19:34,436 --> 01:19:35,687
Come on.

1777
01:19:35,771 --> 01:19:38,774
Would it roll this way?
If pushed there, will you be yellow?

1778
01:19:38,857 --> 01:19:40,817
-I'd end up here. Yes, yellow.
-So it's yellow.

1779
01:19:40,901 --> 01:19:42,778
After that, you go up once and right once.

1780
01:19:42,861 --> 01:19:44,488
-That lands you as white.
-Does white show up?

1781
01:19:44,571 --> 01:19:46,364
-You do?
-You end up as white showing up.

1782
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:48,784
You will finish as white? Come here a sec.

1783
01:19:49,868 --> 01:19:51,495
But you've already reached the goal then.

1784
01:19:51,578 --> 01:19:54,080
-Is that okay? Have you checked?
-I don't think that works.

1785
01:19:54,164 --> 01:19:55,957
Yes, I checked going into the goal
with white facing up.

1786
01:19:56,041 --> 01:19:58,627
For example,
if white faces up when entering the goal,

1787
01:19:58,710 --> 01:20:00,754
are you exiled and sent back to restart?

1788
01:20:00,837 --> 01:20:02,589
I am not at liberty to discuss that.

1789
01:20:02,672 --> 01:20:04,257
-Son Eun-yu.
-Yes?

1790
01:20:04,341 --> 01:20:06,468
As a reminder,
I told you I was unable to answer that.

1791
01:20:06,551 --> 01:20:09,012
You said you couldn't say. Sorry.

1792
01:20:09,095 --> 01:20:10,847
I don't think it will be a problem.

1793
01:20:10,931 --> 01:20:13,266
I don't want to risk it.

1794
01:20:16,436 --> 01:20:18,355
I could get rid of Ha-rin right now.

1795
01:20:18,438 --> 01:20:19,648
So could I.

1796
01:20:19,731 --> 01:20:22,025
Right, either one of us
could get rid of her.

1797
01:20:22,108 --> 01:20:25,111
Sure, but it would be nice
if you'd help me.

1798
01:20:25,195 --> 01:20:27,614
If you give me a Piece,
I'll leave you alone.

1799
01:20:29,074 --> 01:20:32,369
I didn't like some aspects
of Ha-rin's gameplay this time.

1800
01:20:32,452 --> 01:20:34,621
She was doing lots
of wheeling and dealing.

1801
01:20:34,704 --> 01:20:36,581
Offering this if they help and whatnot…

1802
01:20:36,665 --> 01:20:38,250
Then, what about her supporters?

1803
01:20:38,333 --> 01:20:39,668
-One to you?
-You'd break even.

1804
01:20:39,751 --> 01:20:41,545
Yes, if I give you one, I'd break even.

1805
01:20:41,628 --> 01:20:43,839
Then, I will push you to exile.

1806
01:20:43,922 --> 01:20:47,342
We need to focus on the battle,
but you only think of moving to the goal.

1807
01:20:47,425 --> 01:20:50,679
We're all playing
for ourselves in the end,

1808
01:20:50,762 --> 01:20:54,307
so I didn't want to
get involved with either side.

1809
01:20:54,391 --> 01:20:56,309
I just wanted to play my own game.

1810
01:20:56,393 --> 01:20:58,645
If Ha-rin gives him a Piece,
he won't exile her.

1811
01:20:58,728 --> 01:21:00,647
He asked for a Piece to spare her?

1812
01:21:00,730 --> 01:21:02,983
He said he'd leave her alone
if she gave him a Piece.

1813
01:21:03,066 --> 01:21:04,401
Actually, Ha-rin asked first.

1814
01:21:04,484 --> 01:21:07,195
Since we're here now,
let's just send 7high off.

1815
01:21:07,279 --> 01:21:08,154
Send 7high off?

1816
01:21:08,238 --> 01:21:09,906
Then, one person will be out.

1817
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:12,659
Afterward, it should be
a lot more peaceful.

1818
01:21:12,742 --> 01:21:15,287
My original plan was
to get Ha-rin to the goal square,

1819
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:16,913
but doing it peacefully…

1820
01:21:16,997 --> 01:21:21,251
Come here. On the surface,
I'm going to look like I'm helping 7high.

1821
01:21:21,334 --> 01:21:22,377
-I got it.
-On the surface.

1822
01:21:22,460 --> 01:21:25,505
I tried to make it seem like
I was helping out the living area people.

1823
01:21:25,589 --> 01:21:27,382
I'll send 7high forward one square.

1824
01:21:27,465 --> 01:21:29,384
-What?
-I'll send you forward one square.

1825
01:21:29,467 --> 01:21:30,552
Do you have a turn left?

1826
01:21:30,635 --> 01:21:32,971
-Yes, I do.
-Push me up then.

1827
01:21:33,054 --> 01:21:35,098
Please move 7high forward one square.

1828
01:21:35,181 --> 01:21:36,850
Would you like to move 7high to 67?

1829
01:21:36,933 --> 01:21:38,268
Yes.

1830
01:21:38,351 --> 01:21:41,021
7high, please choose
a different color to face up.

1831
01:21:41,104 --> 01:21:42,522
I will change it to green.

1832
01:21:42,606 --> 01:21:44,357
-Is this correct?
-Yes, it is.

1833
01:21:44,441 --> 01:21:46,610
Son Eun-yu, please move
your counter one square.

1834
01:21:46,693 --> 01:21:48,069
I will move to 115.

1835
01:21:48,153 --> 01:21:49,654
Moving to 115.

1836
01:21:50,655 --> 01:21:53,116
Son Eun-yu, please select
a player of any color

1837
01:21:53,199 --> 01:21:55,744
and move their counter one square.

1838
01:21:55,827 --> 01:21:59,164
I will push Ha-rin to 130.

1839
01:21:59,247 --> 01:22:01,958
Moving Kim Ha-rin to 130.

1840
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:05,128
Two squares left.

1841
01:22:05,211 --> 01:22:07,464
Kim Ha-rin, please change your color.

1842
01:22:07,547 --> 01:22:09,716
-No one to attack me if I'm purple?
-No.

1843
01:22:09,799 --> 01:22:11,343
I will change to purple.

1844
01:22:11,426 --> 01:22:12,969
-Is this correct?
-Yes.

1845
01:22:15,388 --> 01:22:17,223
Damn. Then, it's up to me.

1846
01:22:17,307 --> 01:22:19,351
It's not you. I come first.

1847
01:22:20,018 --> 01:22:22,270
A purple sniper has been on standby.

1848
01:22:23,021 --> 01:22:24,814
Look forward to my bullet.

1849
01:22:24,898 --> 01:22:25,774
7high is next.

1850
01:22:25,857 --> 01:22:27,192
I will move to 91.

1851
01:22:27,275 --> 01:22:29,486
Moving to 91.

1852
01:22:29,569 --> 01:22:30,820
Kang Ji-yeong is next.

1853
01:22:30,904 --> 01:22:33,406
I will go to 119.

1854
01:22:33,490 --> 01:22:34,866
Moving to 119.

1855
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:35,825
Yes.

1856
01:22:36,534 --> 01:22:38,203
Lee Se-dol is next.

1857
01:22:38,286 --> 01:22:39,829
I will go to 109.

1858
01:22:39,913 --> 01:22:41,498
-Moving to 109.
-Yes.

1859
01:22:42,666 --> 01:22:47,087
Please select a purple player
and move their counter one square.

1860
01:22:47,170 --> 01:22:49,422
Me. You can move me forward.

1861
01:22:49,506 --> 01:22:51,758
If you push me forward, I will finish.

1862
01:22:51,841 --> 01:22:54,052
If Se-dol pushes her forward, it's over.

1863
01:22:54,135 --> 01:22:55,178
Send me here.

1864
01:22:55,261 --> 01:22:57,806
To the closest square? Move her to 131.

1865
01:22:57,889 --> 01:23:00,225
Moving Kim Ha-rin to 131.

1866
01:23:03,061 --> 01:23:04,771
Get… It's over.

1867
01:23:06,523 --> 01:23:11,277
Kim Ha-rin, please select a blue player
and move their counter one square.

1868
01:23:11,861 --> 01:23:15,949
The only blue player is Tinno,
so I will move him to 50.

1869
01:23:16,032 --> 01:23:17,826
Moving Tinno to 50.

1870
01:23:19,452 --> 01:23:24,624
Tinno, please select a purple player
and move their counter one square.

1871
01:23:24,708 --> 01:23:26,668
-Where?
-Move me to the left.

1872
01:23:28,378 --> 01:23:30,839
Yes, I will send Sang-yeon to 83.

1873
01:23:30,922 --> 01:23:33,883
Moving Park Sang-yeon to 83.

1874
01:23:35,176 --> 01:23:37,178
Please choose
a different color to face up.

1875
01:23:37,262 --> 01:23:38,596
I will change it to this.

1876
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:40,015
Is this correct?

1877
01:23:40,098 --> 01:23:41,224
Yes, it is.

1878
01:23:41,975 --> 01:23:46,187
Please select a green player
and move their counter one square.

1879
01:23:46,271 --> 01:23:48,440
Justin is the only choice.

1880
01:23:48,523 --> 01:23:50,108
There is no one except Justin Min.

1881
01:23:50,191 --> 01:23:51,609
Please choose a direction.

1882
01:23:51,693 --> 01:23:52,610
Just a moment.

1883
01:23:52,694 --> 01:23:53,945
It's your choice.

1884
01:23:54,446 --> 01:23:57,532
If I don't push him out, on his next turn,

1885
01:23:57,615 --> 01:24:00,535
Justin could move to yellow,
which might not be good for us.

1886
01:24:00,618 --> 01:24:03,747
If I push him forward,
Justin can move and get four yellows.

1887
01:24:04,873 --> 01:24:07,208
So I will have no choice
but to kill Justin.

1888
01:24:07,876 --> 01:24:10,587
There's no need to feel guilty
because they did it first.

1889
01:24:10,670 --> 01:24:13,381
That agreement has been abandoned.

1890
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:19,679
I had to choose one alliance to stick to.

1891
01:24:19,763 --> 01:24:23,349
I'm sorry, Justin. I'm sending you to 56.

1892
01:24:24,017 --> 01:24:26,895
I believe I made
the right decision at that moment.

1893
01:24:26,978 --> 01:24:29,731
Moving Justin Min to 56.

1894
01:24:31,107 --> 01:24:33,401
Justin Min, you have been exiled.

1895
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:36,571
You will be given one exile token.

1896
01:24:37,238 --> 01:24:39,074
Place your counter on a starting square.

1897
01:24:39,157 --> 01:24:41,326
Why? What's going on?

1898
01:24:42,869 --> 01:24:43,787
Here.

1899
01:24:43,870 --> 01:24:45,080
Like this. Nice.

1900
01:24:46,164 --> 01:24:47,582
Yoon So-hui is next.

1901
01:24:47,665 --> 01:24:51,169
I will go to 88.

1902
01:24:51,252 --> 01:24:52,962
-Moving to 88.
-Yes.

1903
01:24:53,463 --> 01:24:58,259
Please select a red player
and move their counter one square.

1904
01:24:58,343 --> 01:25:01,638
I will push 7high to 111.

1905
01:25:01,721 --> 01:25:04,682
-Moving 7high's counter to 111.
-Yes

1906
01:25:04,766 --> 01:25:06,059
Park Sang-yeon is next.

1907
01:25:06,142 --> 01:25:08,269
I will move to 105.

1908
01:25:08,353 --> 01:25:09,854
Moving to 105.

1909
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:11,648
Please change your color.

1910
01:25:12,690 --> 01:25:14,984
I will change it to this.

1911
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:19,030
Park Sang-yeon,
please select a player of any color

1912
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:21,324
and move them one square,

1913
01:25:21,407 --> 01:25:23,576
and then yours as well.

1914
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:24,953
Sang-yeon, one more time.

1915
01:25:30,083 --> 01:25:32,252
First, I will move Eun-yu to 114.

1916
01:25:32,335 --> 01:25:34,504
I will move Eun-yu to 114.

1917
01:25:34,587 --> 01:25:35,630
Who?

1918
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:37,132
Me?

1919
01:25:38,258 --> 01:25:40,593
Moving Son Eun-yu to 114.

1920
01:25:41,094 --> 01:25:43,012
Son Eun-yu has been exiled.

1921
01:25:45,598 --> 01:25:47,183
Now, this is war.

1922
01:25:48,601 --> 01:25:50,395
-It's war now.
-You moved me?

1923
01:25:51,521 --> 01:25:52,939
It's just war now.

1924
01:25:53,523 --> 01:25:54,732
Who killed her?

1925
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:56,901
-Took your shot?
-Who killed her?

1926
01:25:56,985 --> 01:25:59,112
Sang-yeon fired a yellow golden bullet.

1927
01:25:59,195 --> 01:26:01,573
Sang-yeon is going on a killing spree.

1928
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:04,742
No, I have the opportunity to win.

1929
01:26:05,326 --> 01:26:07,495
Place your counter on a starting square.

1930
01:26:10,957 --> 01:26:12,167
Sang-yeon.

1931
01:26:14,294 --> 01:26:16,462
We have no choice
but to pick Sang-yeon now.

1932
01:26:16,546 --> 01:26:18,173
-He's very…
-But maybe not?

1933
01:26:18,256 --> 01:26:19,674
He's got some determination.

1934
01:26:19,757 --> 01:26:21,551
I think we can make Sang-yeon win.

1935
01:26:21,634 --> 01:26:23,011
Yeah, we were thinking that.

1936
01:26:23,094 --> 01:26:25,388
I will put it here.

1937
01:26:25,471 --> 01:26:26,389
Okay.

1938
01:26:26,472 --> 01:26:28,558
Park Sang-yeon,
please move your counter again.

1939
01:26:28,641 --> 01:26:30,268
I will move to 123.

1940
01:26:30,351 --> 01:26:31,978
Moving to 123.

1941
01:26:33,646 --> 01:26:35,231
Please change your color.

1942
01:26:35,815 --> 01:26:37,150
I will change it to yellow.

1943
01:26:37,233 --> 01:26:38,234
You're doing great.

1944
01:26:38,318 --> 01:26:39,402
I will do it like this.

1945
01:26:39,944 --> 01:26:41,571
-Is this correct?
-Yes.

1946
01:26:43,364 --> 01:26:45,909
Park Sang-yeon, please select
a player of any color

1947
01:26:45,992 --> 01:26:48,870
and move their counter one square.

1948
01:26:48,953 --> 01:26:50,163
Then, you kill her.

1949
01:26:53,249 --> 01:26:55,293
And then, move yours as well.

1950
01:26:55,376 --> 01:26:56,461
He shoots and moves again?

1951
01:26:56,544 --> 01:26:58,213
Yeah, he gets to go once more.

1952
01:26:58,296 --> 01:27:01,382
Please select a player of any color

1953
01:27:01,466 --> 01:27:03,051
and move their counter one square.

1954
01:27:04,385 --> 01:27:06,721
I will move her to 117.

1955
01:27:06,804 --> 01:27:09,098
I will move her to 117.

1956
01:27:09,182 --> 01:27:10,391
Move Kim Ha-rin's counter?

1957
01:27:10,475 --> 01:27:11,893
-Yes.
-Wait, hold on.

1958
01:27:14,354 --> 01:27:16,105
You're trying to make an enemy of me.

1959
01:27:17,982 --> 01:27:19,442
Kim Ha-rin has been exiled.

1960
01:27:22,737 --> 01:27:23,863
We're still in it.

1961
01:27:25,156 --> 01:27:26,783
You will be given one exile token.

1962
01:27:29,661 --> 01:27:31,621
Place your counter on a starting square.

1963
01:27:32,830 --> 01:27:33,957
Have you placed it?

1964
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:35,166
Yes, I have.

1965
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:42,131
So pissed off.

1966
01:27:43,132 --> 01:27:45,510
Please move your counter again.

1967
01:27:45,593 --> 01:27:46,719
I will move to 124.

1968
01:27:46,803 --> 01:27:48,304
Moving to 124.

1969
01:27:50,765 --> 01:27:52,433
Please change your counter color.

1970
01:27:54,185 --> 01:27:55,561
If you go with yellow,

1971
01:27:55,645 --> 01:27:58,064
Se-dol could come here
as yellow next time.

1972
01:27:58,147 --> 01:28:01,943
If he does, that's triple yellow
and Sang-yeon could die.

1973
01:28:02,026 --> 01:28:04,195
-If he ends like that?
-Yes.

1974
01:28:04,279 --> 01:28:07,323
If it's four or more,
is it for me and someone else?

1975
01:28:07,407 --> 01:28:08,950
Or you just move someone else?

1976
01:28:09,033 --> 01:28:09,993
No, I get to go, too.

1977
01:28:10,076 --> 01:28:14,205
But didn't I already move just now
when I changed to yellow?

1978
01:28:14,289 --> 01:28:16,624
Park Sang-yeon,
please select a player of any color

1979
01:28:16,708 --> 01:28:18,960
and move their counter,

1980
01:28:19,043 --> 01:28:20,295
and then yours as well.

1981
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:22,839
-I went and so will you.
-You will, too.

1982
01:28:22,922 --> 01:28:24,507
-I went and so will you.
-Exactly.

1983
01:28:24,590 --> 01:28:26,009
-You get to move if it's four?
-Yes, with four.

1984
01:28:26,092 --> 01:28:27,051
Then, I'll do this.

1985
01:28:27,135 --> 01:28:28,261
-Is this correct?
-It is.

1986
01:28:28,344 --> 01:28:30,513
-That's right. What we said is right.
-Correct.

1987
01:28:31,681 --> 01:28:32,640
Park Sang-yeon,

1988
01:28:32,724 --> 01:28:34,642
please select a player of any color

1989
01:28:34,726 --> 01:28:36,853
and move them one square.

1990
01:28:36,936 --> 01:28:38,313
Can't I move myself?

1991
01:28:38,938 --> 01:28:40,565
-Of course you can.
-There are four.

1992
01:28:40,648 --> 01:28:42,900
He still hasn't said I can.

1993
01:28:44,736 --> 01:28:47,155
You may only move
another player's counter.

1994
01:28:47,238 --> 01:28:49,198
-Really?
-What the heck?

1995
01:28:49,991 --> 01:28:52,368
I guess
I didn't fully understand the rules.

1996
01:28:55,830 --> 01:28:57,415
Get rid of whoever you want.

1997
01:28:58,291 --> 01:28:59,792
Like who?

1998
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:02,253
Can't you get rid of anyone you want?

1999
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:04,505
Then, don't do that.
Move this one forward.

2000
01:29:04,589 --> 01:29:07,091
Yeah, just get her a little bit closer.

2001
01:29:07,175 --> 01:29:08,634
-Okay.
-We need some insurance.

2002
01:29:08,718 --> 01:29:10,345
Okay. Yes, move me.

2003
01:29:10,428 --> 01:29:12,930
Move her up to protect
against them all firing at her.

2004
01:29:13,014 --> 01:29:16,017
Okay, then I will move
Ji-yeong's counter to 118.

2005
01:29:16,100 --> 01:29:18,186
Moving Kang Ji-yeong's counter to 118.

2006
01:29:20,605 --> 01:29:22,565
We need to just kill them all.

2007
01:29:23,691 --> 01:29:25,693
There's no mercy anymore.

2008
01:29:30,823 --> 01:29:31,991
Choi Hyun-joon is next.

2009
01:29:32,075 --> 01:29:33,785
Please move me to 81.

2010
01:29:33,868 --> 01:29:36,079
Moving to 81.

2011
01:29:36,162 --> 01:29:37,455
Justin Min is next.

2012
01:29:37,538 --> 01:29:39,707
I will go to 67.

2013
01:29:39,791 --> 01:29:41,334
Moving to 67.

2014
01:29:41,417 --> 01:29:43,378
That concludes Round 3.

2015
01:29:44,003 --> 01:29:47,090
Here is the third hidden rule.

2016
01:29:47,173 --> 01:29:48,424
What could it be?

2017
01:29:51,594 --> 01:29:54,430
See? "Anything that has been pushed
suffers no effect."

2018
01:29:54,514 --> 01:29:55,932
So, that was right.

2019
01:29:56,015 --> 01:29:58,226
Round 4 will now begin.

2020
01:29:58,309 --> 01:29:59,227
It's Tinno's turn.

2021
01:29:59,310 --> 01:30:01,062
I will go to 77.

2022
01:30:01,145 --> 01:30:02,772
Moving to 77.

2023
01:30:02,855 --> 01:30:04,690
I will go to 26.

2024
01:30:04,774 --> 01:30:06,275
Moving to 26.

2025
01:30:07,735 --> 01:30:09,278
-To 91?
-I'll go here. Yes.

2026
01:30:10,613 --> 01:30:11,989
Moving to 91.

2027
01:30:12,949 --> 01:30:17,370
Justin Min, please select a green player
and move them one square.

2028
01:30:17,453 --> 01:30:19,956
Currently, there are no green players.
We shall proceed.

2029
01:30:20,039 --> 01:30:23,668
-Jeong Hyun-gyu is next.
-I will go to 35.

2030
01:30:23,751 --> 01:30:25,461
Moving to 35.

2031
01:30:26,212 --> 01:30:28,506
Please select a player of any color

2032
01:30:28,589 --> 01:30:30,133
and move their counter one square,

2033
01:30:30,216 --> 01:30:31,676
and then yours as well.

2034
01:30:31,759 --> 01:30:32,844
Who should I move?

2035
01:30:32,927 --> 01:30:34,679
Justin, what is your number?

2036
01:30:34,762 --> 01:30:37,140
Number 12? What about you, Sang-yeon?

2037
01:30:37,223 --> 01:30:38,933
-Is Sang-yeon 11?
-Move Sang-yeon.

2038
01:30:39,016 --> 01:30:40,726
Then, you go first. Go with Sang-yeon.

2039
01:30:40,810 --> 01:30:43,479
I will move Sang-yeon to 125.

2040
01:30:43,563 --> 01:30:45,898
Moving Park Sang-Yeon's counter to 125.

2041
01:30:48,860 --> 01:30:50,319
I will reverse.

2042
