1
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:07,841
Just do what you want.

2
00:00:09,884 --> 00:00:11,511
Yes, I'm done.

3
00:00:11,594 --> 00:00:15,140
Choi Hyun-joon gets two points on blue.

4
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:17,183
Eun-yu, my alliance is now over.

5
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:19,644
I'm going to show my true colors.

6
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:23,773
He's joined them. Why would he do that?

7
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:26,776
-I know. He has nothing to gain.
-Exactly.

8
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,570
Are they giving him Pieces?

9
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:30,822
Hyun-joon is practically
keeping us guarded here.

10
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:33,867
If not for Hyun-joon,
the game would be over right now.

11
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,579
Hyun-gyu would have taken us
all down. Hyun-joon is keeping us alive.

12
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:42,125
So we have to protect Hyun-joon.
We just have to.

13
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,127
I told you. I'm okay with that, 100%.

14
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,170
Right.

15
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:47,130
Eun-yu went up to Hyun-joon

16
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:50,800
and told him that our ultimate goal

17
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,719
was to eliminate Hyun-gyu.

18
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:55,972
As a result,
he might lose half of his Pieces.

19
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,349
You're probably aware

20
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:01,394
that I can't guarantee that
you won't lose half of your Pieces.

21
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:03,063
-I know.
-Okay? Yeah.

22
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:06,649
It might come across
as the majority bullying the minority,

23
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:11,446
but in any case,
I don't feel any guilt about it.

24
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:13,615
-Hyun-joon is protecting us right now.
-What?

25
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:15,450
Hyun-joon is protecting us right now.

26
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:16,493
-Really?
-Yes.

27
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,703
He could have ended the game just now.

28
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,748
Is that how it is?

29
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,919
I'm not happy about this.
This sucks if that's how it is.

30
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:27,504
It feels lonely.

31
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:28,630
I bet it is.

32
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:33,343
I'm just fighting to win.

33
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,430
I felt like, "Am I the bad guy?"

34
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,015
"Should I just give up?"

35
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,060
It is now Kang Ji-yeong's turn.

36
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:44,562
-There's nothing else I can do. Here I go.
-Yes, go here and get this.

37
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:50,985
Kang Ji-yeong gets four points on blue.

38
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,487
That concludes Round 9.

39
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,115
Round 10 will now begin.

40
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,659
Jeong Hyun-gyu, please move the counters.

41
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:05,542
I'm really not feeling it today.

42
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,419
Me neither. I'd rather
have the game just finish here.

43
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:10,839
But Hyun-joon…

44
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:15,593
I don't have a move.

45
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:27,647
Son Eun-yu gets one point on green.

46
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,065
It is now 7high's turn.

47
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,066
What did he do?

48
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:33,653
-Come here.
-It's a lonely, lonely world.

49
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:38,074
Look at him.
He's really depressed and gutted now.

50
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,993
It's really difficult playing alone.

51
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:43,371
-Hyun-joon won't play with you anymore?
-He's going to stick with them.

52
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:45,748
-No way, really?
-Yeah.

53
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,334
-Weren't you giving him Pieces?
-I said I'd give them to him.

54
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,627
Then why?

55
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,921
He's just betraying me
to team up with them.

56
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,339
They're all banding together?

57
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,633
You made a really tough decision.

58
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,051
I can see through Hyun-gyu.

59
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,846
He showed me the score and
told me I'd end up with the most Pieces.

60
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:02,098
But to be honest,
I'm not really interested in that.

61
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:05,059
If Hyun-gyu and I were to
shut down the game and win,

62
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:07,562
that's also dangerous for me
because I'd have to face him.

63
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:10,231
-He also has some sort of advantage.
-Exactly.

64
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,108
I didn't team up with him
because I knew that.

65
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:15,778
Hyun-gyu tried to rile me up by asking
if I was struggling with the math,

66
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,363
and that just made me so annoyed.

67
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,032
Would I really be that clueless?

68
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:22,994
Now I only have two choices.
Keep getting points or blow it all up.

69
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:24,704
But I don't think I can blow things up.

70
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:27,415
-It must be so hard for you.
-Yes.

71
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:28,458
On your own.

72
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:32,128
Can't you two betray them
and come back to me?

73
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,838
-Now?
-I think I could.

74
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:37,217
I'll take all of Hyun-joon's Pieces
and take you two to the living area.

75
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,178
Today, I would like for it
to be just the three of us.

76
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:42,639
This one. Do this, 7high.

77
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,766
Release this one,
then this will become five.

78
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:47,644
Then whoever is here can get this next.
Then that makes six.

79
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,313
It's good for us to get blue points.
If we do this--

80
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,398
So make a blue pot? That's not a bad idea.

81
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:53,608
What is it you want?

82
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:55,902
From here, it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 spaces.

83
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,570
You'll be there on red…

84
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,114
-It doesn't matter.
-Go to red.

85
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:02,492
We can't get a whole lot of points
evenly all at once anyway.

86
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,744
-Let's stack it up first.
-Okay. Do that.

87
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:07,580
If you put me in on the red,
I'll get this blue and make it six.

88
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,707
So-hui also needs blue, by the way.

89
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:13,002
If you give them to So-hui,
Hyun-gyu will try to end the game.

90
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,837
Hyun-gyu is in first place right now.

91
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,464
It's better for us to get them first.

92
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:18,174
Put So-hui in here.

93
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,884
To keep Hyun-gyu in check.

94
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:27,642
7high gets one point on red.

95
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:28,893
It is now Yoon So-hui's turn.

96
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:30,603
So-hui.

97
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:32,981
-Here--
-She's on my team.

98
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,942
-What was that?
-Hyun-joon went that way.

99
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:41,281
What the heck? So-hui, what's going on?

100
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:42,699
I'm thinking about it.

101
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,617
What are you doing right now?

102
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,202
Hyun-joon betrayed me too.

103
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,579
But we agreed to play together.

104
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:50,206
What the heck?

105
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,833
Did you talk this over with So-hui?

106
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,418
So-hui.

107
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:55,795
Put 7high in here and blow it up.

108
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:56,796
-What?
-Give him four points.

109
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,047
You're going to blow it up, So-hui?

110
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,008
-That was my plan all along.
-I know that.

111
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:03,303
I was going to do it with Hyun-joon,
but he betrayed me and joined you.

112
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,763
I know that. So-hui
agreed to play with us today but now…

113
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:08,766
Now she's back. If Hyun-joon
can say the same and switch sides,

114
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,810
then So-hui can play with you
and join me again.

115
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:12,061
Isn't that the same?

116
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,278
So-hui, are you really going to do this?

117
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:21,612
I'm going to think about it.

118
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:24,741
To be honest, when I agreed
not to play with Hyun-gyu,

119
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,201
I didn't feel too bad about it

120
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,662
because Hyun-gyu
still had Hyun-joon on his side.

121
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:34,250
But Hyun-joon decided
not to side with Hyun-gyu anymore

122
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,252
and made his own moves.

123
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,172
Hyun-gyu complained about
being all alone, and I know how he is.

124
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:41,799
I really felt like he was feeling lonely,

125
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,760
and I just couldn't get past that.

126
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,262
To be honest, I don't think this is right.

127
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,097
It's so unfair, for sure.

128
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,058
That's what keeps going through my mind.

129
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,894
But then, I keep thinking
that games aren't meant to be fair.

130
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,356
There's so many thoughts
racing through my head.

131
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:59,901
I don't think it's right
to eliminate Hyun-gyu like this.

132
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:00,902
I can't do it.

133
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:04,989
I mean, it was okay to try that
when he had Hyun-joon on his side,

134
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,992
because they were tough opponents.

135
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,328
But if we turn our backs on him like this…

136
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:14,040
I just can't do that to Hyun-gyu.

137
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:16,959
I mean, if nothing had happened,
it would've been okay.

138
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:20,505
Hyun-joon only did that
to try and save himself.

139
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:23,174
Of course Hyun-gyu
wants to stay in the game too.

140
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:26,094
So, whatever happens going forward,

141
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:30,348
I don't want to leave him playing
all by himself like that.

142
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,433
Okay, let's go.

143
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:38,189
I was so determined not to cry in here.

144
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,901
It's just because we've spent
so much time playing as a team.

145
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:43,027
But…

146
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,030
there's nothing wrong with that, right?

147
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,909
I mean, let's just look at it logically
with the game in mind.

148
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:52,328
If you want to win this thing,

149
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,455
shouldn't you want to eliminate Hyun-gyu?

150
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,249
And this is our only chance.

151
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:59,502
But I don't like how things have soured.

152
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:03,881
At the beginning, they said they would
applaud betrayal and dirty tricks.

153
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,342
But no one's applauding. They're just…

154
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,844
I see that you're really mad.

155
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,221
I mean, there hasn't been
any theft or violence.

156
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:11,764
But no one's applauding.

157
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,518
7high, let's talk.

158
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:28,114
Anyhow, when we first heard
what you were proposing,

159
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:31,284
we agreed completely
and so we've been playing together.

160
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:34,370
But with Hyun-joon switching sides,

161
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,998
well, it's not about morality
or elitism or anything like that.

162
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:40,251
We just don't feel we can play like this.

163
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,587
Your timing really sucks.

164
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:46,048
Tell us your thoughts.

165
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:50,386
At first, we heard your proposal
and were completely in agreement with it.

166
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,764
And as a player myself,
I thought it was ridiculous to say,

167
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:57,685
"I'll go to prison in your stead.
You go and win this thing."

168
00:07:57,768 --> 00:08:00,605
That's why So-hui and I
decided to join your alliance.

169
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:03,441
But with Hyun-joon switching sides,
that makes it six against one.

170
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:07,403
There are six of us going,
"Now it's your turn to feel the wrath

171
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:11,240
just like you've been doing to us
and controlling us. So die."

172
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,867
What if we don't eliminate him?

173
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:13,868
How will you do it?

174
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:16,579
We just finish the game like this
without eliminating Hyun-gyu.

175
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,789
We'll just let him lose half his Pieces.

176
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,333
Then who's going to finish last?

177
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,834
We can make Hyun-joon last.

178
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,044
So what are you saying?

179
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:25,213
We make both Hyun-gyu and Hyun-joon
lose half their Pieces.

180
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:27,465
-Then, Hyun-joon loses another five?
-Exactly.

181
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:29,091
Why would he agree to that?

182
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:32,053
He would've been fine
if he'd stuck with Hyun-gyu.

183
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:35,139
He only joined us because I was in danger.

184
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,390
He didn't really switch sides.

185
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:40,186
I was very open and told him
that we wouldn't be able to protect him.

186
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:42,396
-I understand Hyun-joon's point of view.
-Yes, he's safe.

187
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,316
And he only did it
to try and save himself.

188
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:48,069
But by doing that,
Hyun-gyu had become all by himself.

189
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:50,863
Even if I win,
I think I'd be really angry at myself.

190
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,282
I just feel like
this is not the way I want to do it.

191
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,160
But I don't really understand this.

192
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:58,371
It's been the majority against one
the whole time.

193
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:00,039
What about when you got rid of Se-dol?

194
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:03,376
Didn't you feel sorry for Justin
when he had to play by himself?

195
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:06,837
Why, all of a sudden, are you being
so righteous? Pretending to be peaceful--

196
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,965
No, they wanted to play by themselves.

197
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,633
But does Hyun-gyu want to play by himself?

198
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:12,593
We made him be by himself.

199
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:17,306
So-hui.

200
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:20,434
But if this happens, look.

201
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,144
The person who benefits the most
is Hyun-gyu.

202
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,689
We're all in grave danger,
and he's the only one who's safe.

203
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:26,440
He doesn't need to do anything right now.

204
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:29,235
So if you do this,
I'm saying that would be unfair to us.

205
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:31,237
We also put our lives
on the line for this.

206
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,322
Betraying us
after making our scores into that,

207
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,574
that's giving us the axe.

208
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:37,535
Why bring feelings into it?
We're all just here to play a game--

209
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:38,619
Hang on.

210
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,580
Why can't I bring feelings into it?

211
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:41,497
What?

212
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,667
-It doesn't make sense. We're human.
-Fine, we get that.

213
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,671
But why didn't you talk about emotions
right at the beginning then?

214
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,007
-Why are you bringing them up now?
-It's different.

215
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,550
Because the situation has changed.

216
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:55,761
I understand
where you're both coming from,

217
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:59,181
but I want to know how you're
planning to play the game from now on.

218
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,726
We haven't discussed it.
It's just that Hyun-gyu asked us for help.

219
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,144
But the thing is,

220
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:05,938
if you do it suddenly
in the middle of a turn,

221
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:09,984
what happens to our moves?
We've been planning various moves.

222
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:14,363
To be honest, my only goal for that round

223
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:18,534
was to execute the plan I had
to get blue points on my next turn.

224
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,329
I wanted them to just come out
and tell us that they were on a team.

225
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:24,457
But for this round, I wanted them
to stick to the original plan.

226
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,876
That's the deal
that I was trying to get out of them.

227
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,129
They're not wrong.
What 7high is saying makes a lot of sense.

228
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:31,922
But the variable is Hyun-joon.

229
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:35,259
I'm not saying that Hyun-joon had
done anything wrong. His choice is his.

230
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:36,927
I know that.

231
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,929
And I only did that
because my emotions took over.

232
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,973
So your emotions are saying
you can't do it.

233
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:44,560
I don't know. But even if I end up dying,
I'd rather play with Hyun-gyu.

234
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,020
Want to do that?

235
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:50,274
To be honest,
if both So-hui and Kyuhyun join Hyun-gyu…

236
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:53,027
Although Hyun-gyu is in first place
at the moment,

237
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:56,614
we can grab first place
if one of us balances up our scores.

238
00:10:56,697 --> 00:11:00,493
Although I really don't want to do this
to Kyuhyun and So-hui,

239
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,119
but if that's what they want,

240
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,789
we'll have to pile it on Kyuhyun
and make one of us finish first.

241
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:08,668
And what's lucky is that
you're in a better situation than he is.

242
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:09,919
You just need some blue points.

243
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,629
-Because of the red?
-Yes.

244
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,717
Have you come to a decision?

245
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,052
What have you decided to do?

246
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:19,929
I know it's uncalled for,
but that's what we're doing.

247
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,556
You've both decided to
play with Hyun-gyu, right?

248
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,058
Then let us make a proposition.

249
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:27,144
-Right now, it's So-hui's turn.
-Right.

250
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:30,147
For this turn, we planned our moves

251
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,483
based on the moves
So-hui was going to make.

252
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,568
So for this round,

253
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:37,988
let's stick to our original plan
and make the moves

254
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,574
that make the most sense
for our previous alliance.

255
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,910
So don't attack anyone,
and just get what we each want.

256
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:43,828
Is that okay?

257
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:46,706
No, you still have to keep Hyun-gyu at bay
for the rest of this round.

258
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,708
-I think we can agree to that.
-As we planned.

259
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:49,875
Let's do that.

260
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,503
Let's do our best again.

261
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:53,838
Jeong Hyun-gyu!

262
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,341
-We're going to side with you.
-Okay.

263
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:01,637
But they want to keep you in check
for the rest of this round

264
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:05,057
because we had plans in motion
with various people in mind.

265
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,892
-Okay.
-That's it.

266
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,394
I'm sorry, everyone.

267
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:09,645
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

268
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:10,646
Okay.

269
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,773
Let's do this. It's So-hui's turn, right?

270
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,316
Okay, can I make a suggestion?

271
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,569
On the next turn, we were originally

272
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:19,029
going to have So-hui take these
and move them to the devil space

273
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,699
so that Ji-yeong would
get a point from the devil space.

274
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:22,700
Okay.

275
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:24,910
I mean, we should do moves
that benefit ourselves

276
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,037
in this round and in this situation.

277
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,831
Let's not, for example,

278
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:32,001
give Ji-yeong one red point
and Eun-yu a green point.

279
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:33,836
Let's just get what we can.

280
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:37,923
But we're not trying
to get what we can and end the game.

281
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,968
We're trying to do what we planned
when we were on the same side.

282
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:44,138
-Just until the end of this round.
-Taking points from the next turn is--

283
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:47,725
Didn't you mean not to attack each other
and just to get whatever points we can?

284
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,894
No. We're saying
for the rest of this round,

285
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,812
we play as we had originally planned.

286
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:54,815
-Right. That's it.
-Because we played according to that.

287
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:58,277
To be honest,
even if we do that for this round,

288
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,404
everything's already a complete mess.

289
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:03,699
Because 12 counters have
already been placed haphazardly.

290
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,576
Then what do you want us to do?

291
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:09,205
So, So-hui splits these three up
and puts Ji-yeong here.

292
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,206
Then what about you?

293
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,666
Then I go here and get some blue points.

294
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:16,378
Well, since those guys
already compromised a lot,

295
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,756
I suggested doing this for them,

296
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,299
and everyone agreed.

297
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:21,884
Okay, what do you want us to do?

298
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,303
I think you just have to
put me on the devil space.

299
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:28,682
Kang Ji-yeong gets one point on red.

300
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,100
It is now Son Eun-yu's turn.

301
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,436
But these are all…

302
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,522
-That's good for you.
-…enemies here.

303
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:35,981
Right. Just get them.

304
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,776
-Son Eun-yu gets six points on blue.
-Into the wolf's lair.

305
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:39,902
I'm there too.

306
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,028
Oh, right.

307
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:42,446
It is now Kyuhyun's turn.

308
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,198
What happens now?

309
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:46,116
Originally, you should've split this one.

310
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,536
But if 7high ends up here, he's screwed.

311
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:51,539
Originally I wouldn't go there
if it was going as planned.

312
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,666
I won't put you there then. Okay.

313
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,751
Let's see.

314
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:58,337
I want to get that though. The blue.

315
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,464
-Do that then. That's good.
-What do you want to do?

316
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:01,674
I want to get that blue one.

317
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:04,426
Anyhow, we can't just benefit you guys
and suffer ourselves.

318
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,762
But we've agreed to
play this round as an alliance--

319
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,681
I know, but I still need to get points.

320
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:11,058
I mean, do this and…

321
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:12,768
So you want me to just help?

322
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,437
No, set it up like this
and get the points later.

323
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,481
-How?
-Then what do you want to do?

324
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:18,607
I want to get that.

325
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:19,692
Then you should do it.

326
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,904
So you're not going to give us this turn?

327
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:28,409
I mean, I won't be attacking
7high with points even if I do this.

328
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:30,870
-Of course not. Not in this round.
-Yes, right.

329
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,580
Or will I just do something safe?

330
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,290
-How?
-Is it better to play it safe?

331
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,500
Isn't it better to empty this green?

332
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:39,712
Because you can get blue points
with that move? Right, two blue points.

333
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,714
That might be a good compromise.

334
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:44,842
-Right, because 7high is in danger.
-Okay, that seems better.

335
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:47,344
-Hyun-joon is in danger, and so am I.
-Yes, let's do that.

336
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,722
-So it's better to clear that green one?
-Yes, is that okay?

337
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:50,848
Okay, go for it.

338
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,224
It's better for you to get points.

339
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,894
Blue like this? Two blue ones?

340
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,897
Kyuhyun has got two points on blue.

341
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,523
It is now Choi Hyun-joon's turn.

342
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,651
-I need red, you need blue.
-Yes.

343
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,821
Hyun-gyu, if you can get us
some points, please do.

344
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,490
-Or be on the offensive if you want.
-Okay, I will.

345
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,326
-Let's take a look at the odds.
-Okay.

346
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,660
Now this is getting fun.

347
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,706
How can they go back to him?

348
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:17,750
Maybe we should've brought only him.

349
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,543
That would've been better. From the start.

350
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,337
Why did Hyun-joon switch sides?

351
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,339
That's why I was like,
"Is he bad at math?"

352
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,341
Don't say it like that.

353
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,301
-He got hurt because you said that.
-Yeah.

354
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:29,261
-That was the reason.
-He said that earlier.

355
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,972
He's totally the emotional type.
He gets hurt easily.

356
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:34,475
I'd better apologize later.
For saying he can't do math.

357
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:35,809
This is so difficult.

358
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:38,228
Still. One, two, three, four, five.

359
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:41,106
I think Eun-yu really wants to come first.

360
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,735
Yes, she really wants
to go to the living area.

361
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:47,446
This is dangerous for us too.

362
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,573
Too many counters in here.
Let's split it up.

363
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,410
Are we going to split this one?

364
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,955
As soon as we put anyone in here
to make it seven,

365
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,581
it can reach all the way
to the devil space,

366
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:58,958
so we have to release it first.

367
00:15:59,041 --> 00:15:59,875
I mean, Ji-yeong should.

368
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:00,876
So, break it apart first?

369
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,253
The difference between Hyun-gyu's scores
is so low.

370
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:04,672
So, Ji-yeong has to release it.

371
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,006
No, wait a sec.

372
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,884
I'm sorry, but we shouldn't
target Hyun-gyu anymore.

373
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,136
Think about it.
Will they push for Hyun-gyu?

374
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,805
With his total score right now?

375
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:15,307
His total score is low.

376
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:18,185
Hyun-gyu isn't the target.
We're in a fight with all three of them.

377
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:23,065
Choi Hyun-joon gets one point on red.

378
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,400
It is now Kang Ji-yeong's turn.

379
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:27,319
Ji-yeong probably
won't see me anymore, right?

380
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,905
-When we get out?
-Yes.

381
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,116
-Well, it's just a game.
-It's just a game.

382
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,826
I think she will call me
"Mr. Cho Kyuhyun."

383
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:35,828
-No, she won't.
-She'll call me by my full name.

384
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:37,329
She's not like that.

385
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:39,498
Hey.

386
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:40,416
What?

387
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,543
-Let's end it with Kyuhyun.
-What?

388
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:44,211
If we end it with Kyuhyun,
Hyun-joon will be in first.

389
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:45,671
-Is Hyun-joon first right now?
-Yes.

390
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:49,008
Oh, he is. Then who's in last place?
Who's in seventh?

391
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,676
How many Pieces does Kyuhyun have?

392
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:51,969
-Isn't it eight?
-Eight.

393
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,387
Then he'll be out. Eliminated.

394
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:56,223
-It's your turn next, isn't it?
-It's my turn.

395
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:00,811
I think I'll be all right because
there aren't many who are going for red.

396
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:03,105
But for So-hui,
there are a few that are after blues…

397
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:10,446
Kyuhyun gets two points on green.

398
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,822
Me? What?

399
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:13,115
That concludes Round 10.

400
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,034
Did you just attack me right at the end?

401
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:17,119
Round 11 will now begin.

402
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,495
Jeong Hyun-gyu will go first.

403
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,998
-They attacked me on the last turn?
-But we agreed not to in that round.

404
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,042
Okay.

405
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,131
I think they're trying to get rid of me.

406
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:32,593
Yes, they're all lumped in with me.
They've set it all up.

407
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:33,552
That's a good setup.

408
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:35,804
Yes, they've given it a lot of thought.

409
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:39,850
There's a possibility that I could
get four green points right now.

410
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:41,185
That would be the worst.

411
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,896
Who do you think is
most desperate to survive?

412
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:45,064
Eun-yu.

413
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:50,652
Okay.

414
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,531
Let's strike Eun-yu down a bit
and get you some points.

415
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:57,534
Then when it's your turn,
we can send more her way.

416
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:58,535
Okay.

417
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:06,752
Jeong Hyun-gyu gets one point on green.

418
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:08,629
It is now 7high's turn.

419
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:10,672
-I end up as -5 points if they do this.
-You?

420
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,341
-Then I'll have three…
-I don't think they'll do that.

421
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,426
-I'll have two points left.
-They can't afford to do that.

422
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,095
-I think they will.
-No, they won't.

423
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:19,223
-Darn, the order of play really sucks.
-Right.

424
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:20,641
How did it end up like this?

425
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:22,684
-Tell me about it.
-Two alliances taking it in turns.

426
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,437
Eun-yu will never do that.

427
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,439
Look, this is right.

428
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,566
But the reason that doesn't work is,

429
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:33,112
Kyuhyun will put me in here
with So-hui on his next turn.

430
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:36,406
Then, unless I put Kyuhyun in there
on my next turn,

431
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,242
he will send me there.

432
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:40,911
So we can't put Kyuhyun in here.

433
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,747
-What?
-We can't put Kyuhyun in here,

434
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,165
because it's So-hui's turn next.

435
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,668
Hey, if you put me here,
I'll go straight to green, dummy.

436
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:48,919
This is driving me crazy.

437
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,712
That's why this one is here.

438
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,256
Is there nothing else you can play?

439
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:55,676
They're giving us points
without picking up any themselves.

440
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:58,345
I'm a bit worried about that.

441
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:00,264
But if they do that, the game's over.

442
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:02,182
It'll be difficult
to try to put you in there.

443
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,642
The devil space?

444
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,853
After all, Eun-yu wants to finish first.

445
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:10,649
Okay.

446
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:20,993
Kyuhyun gets five points on green.

447
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,411
It is now Yoon So-hui's turn.

448
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:33,922
-Minus 13…
-How about I give you some red points?

449
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,009
Kyuhyun's turn is coming up.

450
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,678
If Kyuhyun is at risk of dying,

451
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:42,139
they'll have to try to save him,

452
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:43,432
so they'll waste their turns.

453
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,100
That's why we're laying on the pressure.

454
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:47,144
-We can't let it end like this.
-Exactly.

455
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:50,439
So don't I need to
increase Kyuhyun's score?

456
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:51,356
Do it.

457
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,066
-That's not a bad move, is it?
-No.

458
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:00,199
Kyuhyun gets one point on red.

459
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,242
It is now Son Eun-yu's turn.

460
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,915
Son Eun-yu gets one point on blue.

461
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:12,628
One blue point.

462
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,087
It is now Kyuhyun's turn.

463
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,465
-I can get that. Or here I could…
-And put it where?

464
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,800
I mean, if I move this one,

465
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:22,262
Ji-yeong has a counter here too,
so I'm wondering where I should put her.

466
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,681
-You could put her in the angel space.
-Ji-yeong?

467
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:25,724
Yes, do that first.

468
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:28,393
Next is Hyun-joon.
We have to think about him.

469
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,938
What should we do
to make sure he can't do anything?

470
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:34,274
Isn't this the only place
where he can't really do anything?

471
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,244
Let's go to the living area together.

472
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:48,705
We can get rid of him
if he plays his counters like that.

473
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,958
-Okay, I think this is our best option.
-Yes.

474
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,960
Okay.

475
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:55,921
Okay. Whatever. Let's do this.

476
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:00,842
It's done.

477
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,887
Kyuhyun gets five points on red.

478
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,640
-Look.
-It is now Choi Hyun-joon's turn.

479
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:07,641
Yes.

480
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:10,560
-You take this and put it here.
-Okay.

481
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:14,648
-And then? Which one do I move?
-Anything is fine. Then that makes six.

482
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:15,774
Yes. Six in here.

483
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:18,944
It's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
Then Kyuhyun is finished.

484
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:20,404
But it's Hyun-gyu's turn next.

485
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:21,738
No, it's Ji-yeong next.

486
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:22,656
You're right.

487
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:24,616
-Then it's over, right?
-Yes.

488
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,955
Choi Hyun-joon gets six points on red.

489
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:31,248
It is now Kang Ji-yeong's turn.

490
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,334
So Hyun-joon isn't in first place.

491
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,628
No, Eun-yu is.

492
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,547
Eun-yu is in first.

493
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:41,591
-Isn't Eun-yu in first?
-She is.

494
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,265
Wait, they're ending it?

495
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:51,768
If we don't have 15 points,
we all lose half our Pieces.

496
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:52,686
Exactly.

497
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:54,021
But right now…

498
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:56,064
To be honest, I stand to lose the most.

499
00:21:56,148 --> 00:22:00,027
Despite that, I did it
because it was the right time.

500
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,696
I had to make sure Eun-yu came first

501
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:05,032
to be able to send Hyun-gyu to prison.

502
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:12,289
Kyuhyun gets five points on green.

503
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:17,127
Kyuhyun has accumulated
more than 30 points on green.

504
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:20,505
This concludes Balance Mancala.

505
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,674
Well played. Yeah.

506
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,843
-We didn't have a choice.
-It was my choice.

507
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:28,138
It was my choice.
No one forced me to do it.

508
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:30,807
It was all the result of my own decision.

509
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:34,478
Our original objective was to get
rid of Hyun-gyu and secure first place.

510
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:39,107
I won by finishing off Kyuhyun,
who was on our team this morning,

511
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,943
so I consider it a partial victory.

512
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:45,405
We agreed not to make things difficult
for other players,

513
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:48,241
but at the end of the Round 10,
they lumbered Kyuhyun with some points.

514
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:49,159
So…

515
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:52,788
Well…

516
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:00,754
This happened because of my choice.

517
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:03,632
Kyuhyun ended up that way
because I was too greedy…

518
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:21,733
That's how it ends up
when you team up like that.

519
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:25,987
Thanks.

520
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,327
Here are the results of the game.

521
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:37,958
A penalty will be given to any player
who failed to reach 15 points.

522
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:43,213
All players, please
forfeit half of your Pieces.

523
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:44,923
Gosh.

524
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:56,017
The player with the lowest score is

525
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,352
Kyuhyun.

526
00:23:57,436 --> 00:24:00,897
Kyuhyun, you currently have four Pieces.

527
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:05,610
Please give all your remaining Pieces
to Son Eun-yu.

528
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:08,488
-I did end up helping you in the end.
-Thank you.

529
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:11,074
So you did. We have a deep connection.

530
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:12,576
-I helped you.
-Thank you.

531
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:15,745
Kyuhyun,
you have now lost all your Pieces.

532
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:22,669
Kyuhyun has become the eighth player
eliminated from The Devil's Plan.

533
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:25,046
Wow, eight. Well, I was born in '88.

534
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:28,675
Kyuhyun, please
leave this place immediately.

535
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,806
Since you dealt the final blow,
that makes us even.

536
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,391
-Okay.
-I said this too.

537
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:39,561
We've been wanting
to play together as a team,

538
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,897
and when we did, it ended up like this.

539
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:42,814
Right.

540
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,232
Kyuhyun, we do…

541
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:46,943
-You and I don't make a good team.
-…not make a good team.

542
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:48,153
Not at all.

543
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,116
Bye, Kyuhyun.

544
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,119
Still, at least you avoided prison.

545
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:59,289
-Hey, I'm not cut out for prison.
-Of course not.

546
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:00,707
I'm SUPER JUNIOR.

547
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:01,750
I'm sorry.

548
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,043
Don't be.

549
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:06,713
I think the reason I was eliminated
was my indecisiveness.

550
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:11,676
The problem was probably the side of me
pretending to be righteous.

551
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:16,223
I've done a lot of shows
where I'm a judge or a host.

552
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:19,142
But for the first time in ages,
I felt my blood racing.

553
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:20,727
Becoming an actual contestant,

554
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:24,022
I ran around and racked my brain
with sincere heart

555
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:27,067
for a thrilling experience.

556
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:30,320
I think I'm most grateful
that I'm leaving this show

557
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:34,366
without the need to feel ashamed
of any of my actions.

558
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,077
I'm off.

559
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:43,124
-Have a nice day.
-See you.

560
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,543
Goodbye.

561
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:45,502
GG.

562
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,592
Jeez.

563
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,054
Since I've been practically starved,

564
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:59,099
I really want to enjoy a good dinner
in the living area.

565
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:00,892
Why do I feel so down?

566
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,894
Enjoy the living area, okay?

567
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,854
Ji-yeong, please make it back.

568
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:07,274
You should eat something quickly
while you two are here.

569
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:08,400
Don't you see me?

570
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:10,944
On the fifth day,
you finally get to go to the living area.

571
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:14,364
Still, we got rid of one of them

572
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:17,492
and dragged another one down into hell.

573
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:20,579
I consider it a victory 70 to 80%.

574
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:24,124
Here is the current Piece count
of each player now.

575
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,960
With the least amount of Pieces,

576
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:28,545
Kang Ji-yeong,

577
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:30,088
7high,

578
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:31,548
and Jeong Hyun-gyu,

579
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:34,217
it has been decided
that you will be in the prison block.

580
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,679
I…

581
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:44,811
I would like to use
my reward from the hidden stage.

582
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:46,813
What now?

583
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:49,733
I knew he wasn't telling us.

584
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,193
The benefit wasn't for the final?

585
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:55,947
Your reward from the hidden stage,
ten Pieces,

586
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,198
ten Pieces,

587
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,701
ten Pieces will now be given to you.

588
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,202
What the hell is this?

589
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:23,516
THE DEVIL'S PLAN
DEATH ROOM

590
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,769
Jeong Hyun-gyu, here is your reward.

591
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:27,062
Thank you.

592
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,355
What the heck is this?

593
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:31,107
The current Piece count has been changed.

594
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,402
This is the mother of all twists.

595
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:38,156
The players going to the prison block are

596
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:39,491
Kang Ji-yeong,

597
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,493
7high,

598
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,453
and Son Eun-yu.

599
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,039
Wow, this is doing my head in.

600
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,291
3 DAYS EARLIER

601
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,418
You have succeeded the hidden stage.

602
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,381
As a reward, you will be given ten Pieces.

603
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:57,717
Whenever you want these Pieces,
simply state

604
00:27:57,801 --> 00:28:00,220
"I'd like to receive my reward,"

605
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:03,223
and they will be given to you immediately.

606
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:08,603
You may ask for them
even if you have zero Pieces,

607
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:11,690
but you may not use the reward
in the death room.

608
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:15,276
Like situations when someone is
holding a knife to my throat,

609
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:20,573
or when I can make impossible things
possible with these ten Pieces.

610
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:22,325
I'll use them only in those situations.

611
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:23,868
They haven't given me anything.

612
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,161
What? Then what was it for?

613
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:26,955
Well, they'll give me something
helpful in the final round…

614
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:29,332
-Then no Pieces at all?
-No.

615
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:32,293
I don't consider those
to be my ten Pieces for now.

616
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,462
So I have to try to get
as many Pieces as possible.

617
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,172
I don't have these ten.

618
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:37,674
I don't want to go to prison.

619
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:40,343
I know. I know your stance.

620
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:42,220
Only a fool would
go play the prison match.

621
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:43,221
I have to avoid that.

622
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:45,515
After all the effort
we put in to set this up.

623
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:48,810
The living area
and prison block assignments

624
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,687
have been finalized.

625
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:53,773
Please make your way
to your assigned living spaces.

626
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:55,817
I knew he was hiding something.

627
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,860
Hyun-joon, you had it rough.

628
00:28:56,943 --> 00:29:00,363
You guys killed Kyuhyun for this.

629
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:01,823
Don't forget that.

630
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:03,742
I'll be back tomorrow, so you wait.

631
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,288
Well,

632
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:10,540
I have to kill all of them.

633
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:12,292
I don't trust anyone anymore.

634
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:20,633
I don't care if I get
beaten up tomorrow. It's fine.

635
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,307
Hyun-joon, stay strong.

636
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,225
-Bye.
-Keep up the good fight.

637
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:30,477
Well played.

638
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,061
Well played.

639
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:33,938
Well played.

640
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:44,741
Damn it, why did she end up here?

641
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:46,701
-Eun-yu, what the heck is this?
-It's fine.

642
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,787
Let's pull ourselves together.

643
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:52,165
I assumed he was lying about it.

644
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:55,710
-But I never expected that.
-It really got me. Seriously.

645
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:57,837
Then how many did he have?

646
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,589
-Ten.
-He had ten?

647
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:02,091
So, he could use ten Pieces
any time he wanted.

648
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:04,302
At any time.
Since he could have lost his Pieces.

649
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:05,512
At first, I thought

650
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:09,098
Hyun-gyu was doing everything
he could to avoid being eliminated,

651
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:10,725
but he was never in danger.

652
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,311
-Right.
-So he did that to protect his Pieces…

653
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:14,771
-He did.
-…going to So-hui.

654
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:17,899
Am I just supposed
to accept that right now?

655
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:23,738
What's more, Kyuhyun must have left
thinking he died a hero's death.

656
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:26,032
Don't you think Kyuhyun's aware of it?
Wouldn't he?

657
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:28,451
-I don't think he knows. Would he?
-How could he?

658
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,745
Would he have knowingly
helped him protect 17 Pieces?

659
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:31,913
He didn't think we'd attack him.

660
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:35,041
Here's what I'm saying.
Fine, we couldn't eliminate you. Okay.

661
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:36,501
Let's have a rematch down here.

662
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:38,461
-He's scared to go up against us.
-He says no.

663
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,713
You can't force someone to come.

664
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:43,007
Honestly, I'm so mad right now…

665
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:48,721
Hyun-joon, I'm sorry for saying
you suck at math earlier.

666
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:52,016
No, it's fine.
You must have been taken aback.

667
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,894
Still, it's good
that your reward was Pieces.

668
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:57,480
We tried to send you to prison
because we didn't know.

669
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:12,328
-Hyun-joon, why did you end the game?
-What?

670
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:15,707
Did you do it because you thought
you might lose your Pieces?

671
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,501
I didn't know.

672
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:19,669
We all felt the same,

673
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:22,672
"That guy has a secret reward
for the final."

674
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:25,300
"We can't just let him be
when we don't know what it is."

675
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:26,634
That's why we did that.

676
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,303
So, you were trying to eliminate me?

677
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:30,096
If you had just done nothing,

678
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:32,557
you could have gone into
tomorrow's battle in second place.

679
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,850
But now you're in third.

680
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:34,767
Why am I in third?

681
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,144
Because I'll give So-hui some.

682
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:37,604
Oh, I don't care.

683
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:38,980
Don't give me any and keep them.

684
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:40,106
I mean it.

685
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:41,149
Then just take two.

686
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,901
-No, you keep them.
-Then just one.

687
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:44,736
-No.
-You never know what will happen tomorrow.

688
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:46,988
I know that.
That's why you should keep them.

689
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:49,532
I really want you to go all the way.
So keep them.

690
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:53,828
I would feel awful if you gave them to me
and something happened to both of us,

691
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:54,746
so you keep them.

692
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:57,749
To be honest, I'm really curious
about the bond between you three.

693
00:31:57,832 --> 00:31:59,876
How did you become so tight

694
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:02,211
that you always take each others' side?

695
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:05,214
Just because we've had
a lot of fun playing together.

696
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:07,800
Don't you feel an affinity
with the guys in prison?

697
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:12,096
I do, but you guys all claim
to be really practical…

698
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,641
I was in prison with them both.
They both mean a lot to me.

699
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:15,892
Don't worry about that.

700
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:18,978
-Don't worry.
-Just be practical?

701
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:20,021
-For sure.
-Okay.

702
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:23,274
Everyone's different. It's not
like we have to be practical in here.

703
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:24,901
So, there's a bond between you.

704
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:27,779
I was just wondering what it could be.

705
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:29,822
The person I really wanted
to keep in check

706
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:31,532
is now in first place,

707
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:35,370
and I'm at a disadvantage in many ways.

708
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:40,333
Also, he's a strong player,
but after we failed to send him to prison,

709
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:42,794
I think I'll be fretting all night.

710
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:44,712
-Hey.
-Why ain't I surprised?

711
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:47,090
Eun-yu, give me a Piece.
I'm back to reality.

712
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:49,717
Give me a Piece now
since you didn't get to leave.

713
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,511
-I got four more Pieces.
-Maybe it shouldn't be me.

714
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:53,846
No, it's better to divide them up
to play the game.

715
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,723
Because we don't know who'll be gone?

716
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,809
Yes, just give me one.
And give one to Ji-yeong.

717
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:59,143
You can both have three each.

718
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,520
Three, three, two, is that okay?

719
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:01,771
-Do you have two?
-I have two.

720
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:04,273
It's fine.
I'll take responsibility for it.

721
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:07,402
By the way, wasn't that still
quite a good result today?

722
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,570
After we split up,

723
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,698
to be honest,
our moves were much worse off.

724
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:13,241
But we turned it around.

725
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,993
In any case, we got the win.

726
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:18,287
Right, I think that was an achievement
in and of itself. Honestly.

727
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:22,166
Well, but I'm not sure
who that achievement was for.

728
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,502
If you look at it
from Hyun-gyu's point of view,

729
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:27,338
he got rid of Kyuhyun,
who had nine Pieces, thanks to us.

730
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:28,965
It did turn out best for Hyun-gyu,

731
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:31,259
because he's the only one
who got more Pieces,

732
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:33,594
and even Hyun-joon
lost half of his Pieces.

733
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:36,264
So, I feel like
I cleaned everything up for him,

734
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:39,892
and I'm just trying to think
if there's anything I missed.

735
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,937
The hidden rule ruined

736
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:46,524
our plan to shake things up a bit.

737
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:48,901
It's disappointing, and it sucks.

738
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,778
I wonder what we get tonight…

739
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:56,117
I'm suddenly curious about something.

740
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:00,121
What is the situation
between Hyun-joon and Hyun-gyu?

741
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,497
Why are you asking me that?

742
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:03,291
-I have no idea.
-What I mean is,

743
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:07,045
the way I saw them,
it wasn't like that from the beginning.

744
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:08,796
How did you see them?

745
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,465
Both were like,

746
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:13,760
"I'll scratch your back
if you scratch mine" kind of thing.

747
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:17,305
Okay. Since Hyun-joon
is officially on our side now,

748
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:19,015
I'll tell you the truth.

749
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:23,061
Ever since he got out of here,
Hyun-joon has been…

750
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:24,896
-Talking with you.
-…talking with me.

751
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:29,400
We've been trying to get rid of Hyun-gyu
every chance we got.

752
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,110
He'd already set his mind to that?

753
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,821
-While we were playing that monster game…
-Okay.

754
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,157
You can use items on people.

755
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,285
I want to try it out
with a sneak attack on someone.

756
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:41,579
-Oh, he told you?
-He told me back then.

757
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:44,207
After finding that out,
we originally tried to kill Hyun-gyu.

758
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:45,625
Then attack just once.

759
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:47,293
-On Hyun-gyu?
-Yes, attack him just once.

760
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:51,172
In any case, Hyun-joon has been
sort of on our side all along.

761
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:54,092
I really want to get changed.

762
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:55,927
I've been getting changed every day.

763
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,512
Right, you have new clothes.

764
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:58,763
I wear new clothes every day.

765
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:01,891
People will probably think you've
been wearing the same clothes all week.

766
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:04,852
I change every day and even take a shower.

767
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:08,356
Gosh, my head.

768
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:14,946
Are you okay with your fever?

769
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:16,114
Yes, I'm fine.

770
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:19,534
Then were they trying to get me over there

771
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:23,204
and then eliminate me
by ganging up on me in the prison match?

772
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:24,247
Right.

773
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,415
But eliminating me
doesn't mean they'd win.

774
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,459
I guess they felt
they had to eliminate you

775
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:31,295
because they didn't know
what kind of reward you had.

776
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:34,757
So, I wasn't really happy
with what they said.

777
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,342
So-hui, you have to aim to win.

778
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:38,469
The rest of us are just trying to survive.

779
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,680
They were saying
they had no ambition to win,

780
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:43,057
-but they clearly do.
-Exactly.

781
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,601
They're being like that
because they want to win.

782
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,770
How many Pieces does he have right now?

783
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:49,814
-He had 13 and lost half, so six?
-He has seven.

784
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:50,898
-Seven?
-Yes.

785
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:53,192
No.

786
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:55,111
You should be in second.
That's better for me.

787
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:56,696
Then how many do you have?

788
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:59,198
I have 12. I have plenty.

789
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:06,747
I gave her two.

790
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:07,915
Good.

791
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,335
I wonder how long Pieces
will be important.

792
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:12,503
It ends tomorrow.

793
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,672
Whoever two have
the most Pieces tomorrow are it.

794
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:16,591
I don't think there'll be prison tomorrow.

795
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:21,220
Since everyone has their own thoughts,

796
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:24,098
they're all saying they're fine,
but they're not.

797
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,183
Perk up, you.

798
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:27,685
If you're like that,
it makes me feel uncomfortable.

799
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:30,563
-No, I'm not like this because of you two.
-Cheer up.

800
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:32,190
The three of them went to prison again.

801
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:33,858
-So you're feeling down?
-Yes, of course.

802
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:36,194
-Don't cry.
-I have to see them play the death match.

803
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:39,322
I didn't know you'd feel like that.
I'm sorry.

804
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:41,532
I wonder what today's game will be.

805
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:42,575
So do I.

806
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:44,243
The three of us are sitting here again.

807
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,454
And later,
it will just be two of us sitting here.

808
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:49,332
But today's prison match
is going to be crazy.

809
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:52,210
In any case,
let's do our best and play fair.

810
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:54,962
And please don't die helplessly tomorrow.

811
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,840
Right, whoever survives, do your best.

812
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:02,053
Wow, it's that time again.

813
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:06,265
The prison match will begin in 30 minutes.

814
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:07,850
It doesn't even surprise me anymore.

815
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:10,978
Here is the fifth prison match,

816
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:14,398
which will determine
the ninth player to be eliminated.

817
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:16,275
Today's prison match is

818
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:18,069
Wall Go.

819
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,528
They're playing Wall Go.

820
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:20,780
-What the heck?
-The three of us?

821
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:23,616
Wall Go is a game where
players have to build walls on the board

822
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:27,411
to make their territories
as large as possible.

823
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:28,871
Hey, we did this together already.

824
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:31,958
Before the game starts,
players will draw balls

825
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,960
to determine the order of play.

826
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:37,213
Each player will be given two counters

827
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:40,341
with each player having a different color.

828
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:43,261
Beginning with the player going first,

829
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:45,721
each player will take turns to place

830
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,723
their first counter
on a square of their choice.

831
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:51,560
The order will be reversed
when placing the second counter.

832
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,063
When the game starts,

833
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:57,817
each player in turn will move
one of their counters

834
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,695
one or two spaces.

835
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,282
Counters can be
moved up, down, left or right,

836
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:07,535
but cannot be moved
to a space that is already occupied.

837
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:09,245
When moving two spaces,

838
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:11,998
it is possible to move
your counter one space forward

839
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:15,042
and then back to
occupy the original space.

840
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,585
I think placement is
about 60% of this game.

841
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:18,254
After you move your counter,

842
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:22,466
you must build a wall on one of the sides
of the square occupied by your counter.

843
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:25,177
It is not possible to
build a wall on a side

844
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:27,263
where a wall has already been built.

845
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:31,225
Each player has 90 seconds
to complete their turn,

846
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:34,895
and if they exceed their time,
a wall will be placed at random.

847
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:39,025
When moving a counter,

848
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:41,694
it may not pass through a wall

849
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:44,447
that is blocking its way.

850
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:47,908
However, each player
will be given one chance

851
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:50,703
to knock down
a wall on one of their turns.

852
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:55,583
A player may only knock down
a wall that is blocking their path.

853
00:38:56,375 --> 00:39:00,046
The game will continue in this fashion

854
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:04,383
until each player's counters are walled
into their own separate territory,

855
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,844
at which point the game will end.

856
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:10,765
Players should note that the game will end

857
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:14,226
even if not all players have taken
the chance to play their wall breaker.

858
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,311
I see.

859
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:17,772
The number of squares
enclosed in each player's territory

860
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:19,273
will be added together,

861
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,734
and according to
the size of their territories,

862
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:23,569
players will be ranked,

863
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:26,447
with the player finishing first
securing their survival.

864
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:29,825
If multiple players have
the same number of squares,

865
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:31,744
their rankings will be decided by

866
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:35,122
comparing the areas
of their biggest territories.

867
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:39,585
The player finishing first
will be rewarded with one Piece.

868
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:43,381
The remaining two players will engage

869
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:45,257
in another game of Wall Go.

870
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:46,759
Another game?

871
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:48,511
That's too harsh.

872
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:51,764
At this time, the rule about
using a wall breaker will be rescinded.

873
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:53,516
When the game ends,

874
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:57,520
the player with the larger territory
will secure their survival.

875
00:39:57,603 --> 00:40:01,857
The last remaining player will
be eliminated from The Devil's Plan.

876
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:06,404
The game will start in 30 minutes.

877
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:09,615
I think it's quite fair
when it's three players.

878
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:11,158
Because when three play,

879
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:14,120
if one person makes a bad move,
it's so disadvantageous.

880
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:15,830
One-on-one should be fun.

881
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,581
There are four counters
when it's one-on-one.

882
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:19,041
But there's no wall breaker.

883
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:21,919
-Right, so it's a battle of pure skill.
-Right.

884
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:25,297
We played Wall Go among ourselves
a few times.

885
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:27,842
We didn't play it that much,
but it was a lot of fun.

886
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:31,262
You can knock a wall down once,
which can be an unknown variable.

887
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:32,471
When? Whenever you want?

888
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:33,931
Yes, on one of your turns.

889
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:36,058
After knocking it down,
you can rebuild it.

890
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:38,185
After you go through it. Yes, right.

891
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,437
That's a variable.

892
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,689
Well, it's only once a game. Yes.

893
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:42,898
Then I'll knock it down.

894
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:45,443
Wow, then you've used it.

895
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:46,610
What happens now?

896
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:47,945
Now he's used it.

897
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:49,155
You smash it and move?

898
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:50,698
Yes, then keep on with your turn.

899
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:52,241
-I can just block it like this.
-Wow.

900
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:56,829
Crazy. But now you've played your trump.
You've taken your shot.

901
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:59,290
This is fun. It's simple but a lot of fun.

902
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:00,833
I'll brick him up.

903
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:03,085
Although he'll
probably smash right through.

904
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:05,796
But if there's a counter here,
he can't break through that way, right?

905
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,923
He can only come out this way, right?

906
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,717
That's why blocking is crucial.

907
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,886
-Eun-yu will probably be quite good.
-Right.

908
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,722
Then it'll end up as a fight
between Ji-yeong and 7high.

909
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:17,308
There's nothing to do in prison
except play Wall Go and Knight's Tour.

910
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:22,354
The game of Wall Go was in the prison,

911
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:26,025
and I tried to play it
several times from day two,

912
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:28,527
but I couldn't finish it,

913
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:32,239
but then I finally succeeded
on the morning of day four.

914
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:35,284
At that time,
I played with 7high and Ji-yeong too.

915
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:39,038
I thought it'd be tough to beat 7high
in a one-on-one match.

916
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:41,665
Gosh, I had no idea
we'd end up playing this here.

917
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:52,051
Emotionally, I feel like
we're all on the same team.

918
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:55,804
But it's clear this is a match
to decide who represents us.

919
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:58,599
Whoever does well
at this game will survive

920
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:00,976
to get the opportunity
to face off against them.

921
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:05,731
Well, I'm ready to fight fairly
and accept the result whoever wins.

922
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:09,276
I think the other two also feel the same.

923
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,696
So I'm going to take it seriously
and give it my best.

924
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,074
Who do you have the closest bond with?

925
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:16,075
Eun-yu.

926
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:19,119
I feel sorry for her.
I have a lot of sympathy for Eun-yu.

927
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,330
Tomorrow is the last day,
if you exclude the final.

928
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:23,666
Staying in prison the whole time
can't be easy.

929
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:30,464
I guess the chicken in my porridge
this morning wasn't big enough.

930
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,841
Are you talking about
your "What good luck!" speech?

931
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:35,135
I had a good feeling about today,

932
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,554
but it didn't end well.

933
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:42,935
The prison match will begin shortly.

934
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,187
All prison players,

935
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:47,856
please make your way to the death room.

936
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,191
Let's do this!

937
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:51,026
Seriously, let's try and make it fun.

938
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,695
Let's do this properly.

939
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:54,572
-Let's have fun.
-Nice.

940
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:58,659
If 7high comes back tomorrow,
I think he'll storm in gnashing his teeth.

941
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:01,662
Personally, I hope he's eliminated.
I find him scary.

942
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:02,913
Me too.

943
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:06,083
Wow, I'm back here again.

944
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:20,723
-Why don't we start with a handshake?
-Shall we?

945
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:22,391
Let's play fair.

946
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:24,810
Good luck.

947
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:26,770
Do your best, everyone.

948
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:28,689
Wow, Eun-yu.

949
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:30,649
She just looks so pretty now.

950
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:33,694
With her hair tied back like that,
everything about her.

951
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:36,238
The fifth prison match,

952
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:38,532
Wall Go, will begin now.

953
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:40,784
First, we will decide the order of play.

954
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:42,411
I've got number two.

955
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:43,912
Number three is good.

956
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:47,041
You will now place your counters.

957
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:49,293
Kang Ji-yeong,
please place one of your counters.

958
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:50,753
Well.

959
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:55,424
It's hard when there are three players.

960
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:57,885
Is it too far towards the middle?

961
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:04,683
Next is Son Eun-yu.

962
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:06,352
Please place a counter.

963
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:09,980
7high.

964
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:14,985
You will now place your second counters.

965
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:17,363
7high, please place your counter.

966
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:23,285
Son Eun-yu.

967
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:27,206
The only thing I was worried about
while placing counters was that

968
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:29,416
I was going second both times.

969
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,669
This was what I was most worried about.

970
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:33,671
When I put my first one on the left,

971
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:35,422
I placed it slightly towards the top.

972
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:39,468
So I thought, "If 7high thinks
it's encroaching on his territory

973
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:43,597
and puts one on my right,
that'll be a bit of a headache,"

974
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,140
but that's exactly what he did.

975
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:48,268
You've really put me in a bind.

976
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,605
Kang Ji-yeong,
please place your second counter.

977
00:44:58,404 --> 00:44:59,488
MORNING, DAY 4

978
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:00,948
Ji-yeong put hers in the middle.

979
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:03,200
I think it'll most likely be isolated.

980
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:06,328
So, for example,
if you imagine four of us are playing

981
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:08,038
and there is a counter here,

982
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:10,916
like this, then this one is trapped.

983
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:13,877
But if you start from the center
and play well,

984
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:16,338
you can actually
secure yourself a lot of territory.

985
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:18,173
All counters have now been placed.

986
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:19,758
We will now begin playing Wall Go.

987
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:22,177
Kang Ji-yeong, you have 90 seconds

988
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:24,888
to move your counter and place a wall.

989
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:48,162
Ji-yeong moved her counter
towards me and immediately put up a wall,

990
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:51,915
which wasn't great for me,
because if she pushes in my direction,

991
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:55,711
that inevitably means
that my plot will be restricted.

992
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:56,879
Son Eun-yu.

993
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:57,796
Okay.

994
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:08,390
They all look nervous from the start
since it's just the three of them.

995
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:09,892
Whose turn is it?

996
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:10,851
7high.

997
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:13,020
-Oh, red?
-Yes.

998
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:14,605
It is now 7high's turn.

999
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:21,111
Of course, the only move I could make

1000
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:25,532
was one to put a border
between Ji-yeong and myself.

1001
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:27,284
It is now Kang Ji-yeong's turn.

1002
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:45,093
It is now Son Eun-yu's turn.

1003
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:48,263
Oops.

1004
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:53,268
It is now 7high's turn.

1005
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:02,778
It must be difficult for you.

1006
00:47:06,114 --> 00:47:07,574
You have 30 seconds remaining.

1007
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:18,126
Nine,

1008
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:19,169
eight,

1009
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:20,629
seven,

1010
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:21,588
six…

1011
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,303
It is now Kang Ji-yeong's turn.

1012
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:41,900
7high can get nine squares
with that red counter.

1013
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:44,486
But if Ji-yeong plays well,
it could be less than nine.

1014
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,738
You have to finish first to get out,

1015
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:49,032
but if he's limited to nine,
it'll be really difficult.

1016
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:50,617
He does have a wall breaker though.

1017
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:54,204
It is now Son Eun-yu's turn.

1018
00:48:00,168 --> 00:48:01,670
You have 30 seconds remaining.

1019
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,258
Ten,

1020
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:07,342
nine,

1021
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:08,594
eight,

1022
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:10,053
seven,

1023
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:11,096
six…

1024
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:13,765
It is now 7high's turn.

1025
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:20,939
And when four people play,

1026
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:23,609
being hemmed in by two walls
is the absolute worst.

1027
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:25,611
-Exactly.
-You could end up dying in one turn.

1028
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:27,112
Exactly. Right.

1029
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:28,780
We've figured that out now.

1030
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:32,326
Now that we've played it,
if it's three players, you play like this,

1031
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:34,912
and as soon as someone is isolated,

1032
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:37,706
you pounce and lock them in
while remaining wary of the other.

1033
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:40,834
And you make it
into a "1-versus-1" type situation.

1034
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,544
Even if you're not in an alliance.

1035
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:51,511
You have 30 seconds remaining.

1036
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:56,016
Then, 7high can't move up there like that,

1037
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:58,852
because the yellow one
will move to block him.

1038
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:01,396
So what happens if he moves to the right?

1039
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,397
Ten,

1040
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:03,523
nine,

1041
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:04,650
eight,

1042
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:05,859
seven,

1043
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:07,027
six…

1044
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:09,112
-It is now Kang Ji-yeong's turn.
-I knew it.

1045
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,667
-She's taken one out of the equation.
-Right.

1046
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:23,085
It is now Son Eun-yu's turn.

1047
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:39,267
Wow, 7high is…

1048
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:42,604
It is now 7high's turn.

1049
00:49:45,273 --> 00:49:48,652
So why did you come this way?
Why did you come?

1050
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:52,531
You have 30 seconds remaining.

1051
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:56,785
It is now Kang Ji-yeong's turn.

1052
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:15,470
It is now Son Eun-yu's turn.

1053
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:25,856
It is now 7high's turn.

1054
00:50:42,622 --> 00:50:44,041
You have 30 seconds remaining.

1055
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:46,251
You're practically penning me in
and beating me down.

1056
00:50:46,334 --> 00:50:47,294
I'm going nuts here.

1057
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:50,797
Well, it only happened
because you came over here.

1058
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,716
However it came about,

1059
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:55,761
I couldn't afford
to waste any more moves on it.

1060
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:57,220
Ten,

1061
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:58,346
nine,

1062
00:50:58,430 --> 00:50:59,556
eight,

1063
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:00,849
seven,

1064
00:51:00,932 --> 00:51:02,017
six,

1065
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,310
five…

1066
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:07,189
I made that move thinking,
"Is this the only move I have?"

1067
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:08,815
I wanted to shut down that fight

1068
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:11,902
and was waiting for the opportunity
to use my wall breaker.

1069
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:13,361
It is now Kang Ji-yeong's turn.

1070
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:16,281
With red and blue facing each other,

1071
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:19,409
it'll take two turns to move
two spaces down and escape,

1072
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:20,786
so they're in deadlock.

1073
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:27,084
She's locking Eun-yu in.

1074
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:28,752
It is now Son Eun-yu's turn.

1075
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:32,214
As 7high and Ji-yeong fought it out,

1076
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:34,341
everyone's territories
kind of became defined.

1077
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:49,940
It is now 7high's turn.

1078
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:53,485
Now 7high has no choice
but to escape to the left to win.

1079
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:54,569
Wouldn't he break through?

1080
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:56,029
I suppose he might. Who knows.

1081
00:51:56,113 --> 00:52:00,200
Eun-yu was benefiting
from my battle with Ji-yeong, so…

1082
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:13,046
I was going back up
to challenge Eun-yu for territory.

1083
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:16,341
It is now Kang Ji-yeong's turn.

1084
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:21,763
It is now Son Eun-yu's turn.

1085
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:26,768
That will make it difficult
for Ji-yeong to move.

1086
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:28,436
Yes, they have to block Ji-yeong in.

1087
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:40,240
Why did she go there?

1088
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:45,579
My counter was trapped
as red and blue were battling.

1089
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:48,748
But I was actually really happy with that.

1090
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:50,458
If someone has got a lot,

1091
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:52,878
and they're not going to
knock a wall down just yet.

1092
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:56,464
Then I wonder if this counter should
move around putting up walls.

1093
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:57,674
Because the funny thing is,

1094
00:52:57,757 --> 00:52:59,759
the territories must be determined
for it to end,

1095
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,469
so even if you've secured land…

1096
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:03,471
Oh, you're right about that. Right.

1097
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:06,016
You would have to keep trapping yourself.

1098
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:08,393
I mean, you end up
reducing your territory yourself.

1099
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:10,687
If you look at the area
where I was trapped,

1100
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:14,232
it was kind of like
one square, two squares, one square.

1101
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:17,861
So, if I left that area and shut it up,

1102
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:19,821
I'd cede it to blue,

1103
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:22,574
but it'd have to keep moving
inside there and reducing its territory.

1104
00:53:22,657 --> 00:53:26,703
So I thought
it was better to give it to someone else.

1105
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:30,916
It is now 7high's turn.

1106
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:40,884
It is now Kang Ji-yeong's turn.

1107
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:47,390
It is now Son Eun-yu's turn.

1108
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:57,776
Oh, she closed it.

1109
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:02,030
7high.

1110
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:10,455
It is now Kang Ji-yeong's turn.

1111
00:54:10,538 --> 00:54:13,875
I was hoping it'd be
turf battle between those two,

1112
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:18,505
but Eun-yu was coming from the top-left,
and 7high was coming like this,

1113
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:22,175
so I was busy defending myself.

1114
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:25,095
After I blocked this one,
I had to block the other next.

1115
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:26,388
You have 30 seconds left.

1116
00:54:31,309 --> 00:54:32,560
Ah, she's blocked him.

1117
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:34,521
Why did she do that?

1118
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:37,440
I think she meant to keep 7high in check.

1119
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:40,819
It is now Son Eun-yu's turn.

1120
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:46,658
It was my objective to get the territory
in my top right, from the start.

1121
00:54:46,741 --> 00:54:49,160
I was waiting for a chance to go there

1122
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:53,164
or to smash through the wall
if I was completely blocked in.

1123
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:55,166
But then Ji-yeong moved up,

1124
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:58,837
so I thought it was my chance
and quickly moved up.

1125
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:02,799
And as I did that,
7high also blocked here,

1126
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:07,887
so I was thinking it would be difficult
for Ji-yeong to do anything up here.

1127
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:12,809
It is now 7high's turn.

1128
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:16,396
Oh, goodness.

1129
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:20,650
Ji-yeong had become
marooned between the two of us.

1130
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:23,236
As a result,
two separate walls had been formed

1131
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,488
rendering my wall breaker useless.

1132
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:28,992
The most decisive thing in
blocking a player's counter is not a wall

1133
00:55:29,075 --> 00:55:31,161
but an opponent's counter.

1134
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:32,996
Even if you knock down a wall,

1135
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:35,415
if your path is blocked
by an opponent's counter,

1136
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:37,792
you cannot gain any territory.

1137
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:40,503
Even if they had used their wall breakers
and moved a space,

1138
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:42,172
I would've blocked all of them,

1139
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:46,009
so I wasn't expecting their wall breakers
would do much to shake things up.

1140
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:52,349
Why are you glaring at me?

1141
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:54,726
It's over. It's finished.
I think we're done.

1142
00:55:58,146 --> 00:55:59,814
It is now Kang Ji-yeong's turn.

1143
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:01,024
Damn it.

1144
00:56:10,575 --> 00:56:12,035
You have 30 seconds remaining.

1145
00:56:13,578 --> 00:56:14,662
Jeez.

1146
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:26,758
I will use my wall breaker.

1147
00:56:27,425 --> 00:56:29,302
-Confirm you will use your wall breaker.
-Yes.

1148
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:32,138
Oh, Ji-yeong's using her wall breaker.

1149
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:34,349
But she should break that one up there.

1150
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:36,059
Please remove a wall
and move your counter.

1151
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:45,360
Why? Eun-yu can
just block that straightaway.

1152
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:47,237
Ten,

1153
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,738
nine,

1154
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:49,948
eight,

1155
00:56:50,031 --> 00:56:51,241
seven,

1156
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:52,534
six,

1157
00:56:52,617 --> 00:56:53,785
five,

1158
00:56:53,868 --> 00:56:55,120
four,

1159
00:56:55,203 --> 00:56:56,204
three,

1160
00:56:56,704 --> 00:56:58,456
two, one.

1161
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:00,959
Your time is up.

1162
00:57:01,042 --> 00:57:02,293
A wall will be placed at random.

1163
00:57:04,045 --> 00:57:05,213
Is that being forced on her?

1164
00:57:05,296 --> 00:57:07,590
-Why didn't she move another space?
-Exactly.

1165
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:11,386
I can't think properly
when I'm pressed for time.

1166
00:57:11,469 --> 00:57:13,930
But this time, we were told
we had up to 90 seconds to think

1167
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:16,766
and do this and that.

1168
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:20,186
That was a lot of pressure
to know I only had 90 seconds.

1169
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:25,024
So, it was like I could
hear a ticking sound in my ears,

1170
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:28,111
and I could feel
the time limit crushing me.

1171
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:30,196
It is now Son Eun-yu's turn.

1172
00:57:31,072 --> 00:57:32,198
It's over.

1173
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:33,366
Eun-yu has won.

1174
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:34,701
Yes, for sure.

1175
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:37,704
Goodness. I hate this.

1176
00:57:58,475 --> 00:57:59,893
Do it quickly.

1177
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:02,103
You know you've won. Everyone knows.

1178
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:04,230
It's okay. It's just a game.
Why are you crying?

1179
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,983
Eun-yu, why are you crying?
There's no need for that.

1180
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:08,860
It's just a game.

1181
00:58:08,943 --> 00:58:12,113
Finish it off quickly.
We all know the score. I knew you knew.

1182
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:16,201
You've won. Well played. Go on.

1183
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:18,912
Do it. Well played. Congratulations.

1184
00:58:19,412 --> 00:58:20,663
You have 30 seconds remaining.

1185
00:58:27,795 --> 00:58:30,006
All counters are now walled off,

1186
00:58:30,089 --> 00:58:31,466
thus ending the game.

1187
00:58:31,549 --> 00:58:34,427
Congratulations. It's okay.
Why are you crying? Come on.

1188
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:37,805
Eun-yu, it's just a game.

1189
00:58:38,306 --> 00:58:39,891
Oh, poor thing.

1190
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:42,477
You just did well.

1191
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:45,313
As a result of
having secured the largest territory,

1192
00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:48,525
Son Eun-yu has secured your survival.

1193
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:54,322
Consequently,
Son Eun-yu will be awarded one Piece.

1194
00:58:56,908 --> 00:59:00,411
Son Eun-yu,
please return to the living space.

1195
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:01,996
Finish it well and come back.

1196
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,039
Okay.

1197
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:12,507
Personally, I think I played
really hard with the two of them.

1198
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:16,386
So when I thought that I was
condemning one of them to leave,

1199
00:59:16,469 --> 00:59:18,137
it was really hard for me.

1200
00:59:22,058 --> 00:59:23,851
Eun-yu is really good.

1201
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:26,688
Even when we played before,
she was always the best.

1202
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:34,821
The funny thing is
that it just so happened that

1203
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:38,575
Ji-yeong and I had
played together for five days.

1204
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:42,495
So now, we have a lot of shared feelings,

1205
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:44,872
and in the end,
when it was just the two of us left,

1206
00:59:44,956 --> 00:59:46,416
I approached the game thinking,

1207
00:59:46,499 --> 00:59:49,836
"The best way to respect
my opponent is to give it my all."

1208
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:52,130
To be honest, in that moment, I felt it.

1209
00:59:52,213 --> 00:59:54,966
We already knew that we'd already decided,

1210
00:59:55,049 --> 00:59:58,511
"If we have to cross swords,
let's fight with dignity."

1211
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:00,138
Once again.

1212
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:04,392
Having failed to secure your survival,

1213
01:00:04,475 --> 01:00:05,643
Kang Ji-yeong

1214
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:07,312
and 7high

1215
01:00:07,395 --> 01:00:09,897
must play another game of Wall Go.

1216
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:13,526
You will be given four counters each.

1217
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:19,115
The positioning of two counters
has been determined in advance,

1218
01:00:19,198 --> 01:00:22,452
but you may choose
where to place the remaining two.

1219
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:28,458
Also, you may not use
the wall breaker in this game.

1220
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:32,629
The player with the largest territory
when the game ends

1221
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:34,339
will earn their survival.

1222
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:35,840
The other player will

1223
01:00:35,923 --> 01:00:38,926
become the latest player
eliminated from The Devil's Plan.

1224
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:43,598
As the player who secured
more territory in the previous round,

1225
01:00:43,681 --> 01:00:45,141
7high will go first.

1226
01:00:45,224 --> 01:00:47,685
Then, the game will now begin.

1227
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:49,771
You will now place your counters.

1228
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:53,900
As the player going first,
7high, please place your first counter.

1229
01:01:03,701 --> 01:01:06,162
Kang Ji-yeong,
please place your first counter.

1230
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:10,958
Kang Ji-yeong,
please place your next counter.

1231
01:01:11,709 --> 01:01:13,544
Put it in the middle.

1232
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:16,923
In the middle.

1233
01:01:18,966 --> 01:01:19,967
There you go.

1234
01:01:20,468 --> 01:01:22,261
-Blocking is going to be important.
-Yes.

1235
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:25,098
7high, please place your final counter.

1236
01:01:27,225 --> 01:01:29,018
All counters have now been placed.

1237
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:32,939
7high, you have 90 seconds
to move a counter and build a wall.

1238
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:37,652
It is now Kang Ji-yeong's turn.

1239
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:46,661
It is now 7high's turn.

1240
01:01:54,252 --> 01:01:55,586
It is now Kang Ji-yeong's turn.

1241
01:01:56,337 --> 01:01:59,674
Ji-yeong needs to move in an L-shape.

1242
01:01:59,757 --> 01:02:01,134
Yes, she's bound to.

1243
01:02:12,812 --> 01:02:14,188
That's not bad.

1244
01:02:14,272 --> 01:02:15,982
In any case,
7high has to get out of there.

1245
01:02:16,482 --> 01:02:17,734
It is now 7high's turn.

1246
01:02:30,705 --> 01:02:31,914
It is now Kang Ji-yeong's turn.

1247
01:02:45,511 --> 01:02:46,763
She's good.

1248
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:50,016
I think she'll win
as long as she remains calm.

1249
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:51,350
It is now 7high's turn.

1250
01:02:56,272 --> 01:02:57,732
You have 30 seconds remaining.

1251
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:09,035
Ten, nine, eight, seven…

1252
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:11,579
It is now Kang Ji-yeong's turn.

1253
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:21,464
It is now 7high's turn.

1254
01:03:31,682 --> 01:03:33,059
It is now Kang Ji-yeong's turn.

1255
01:03:41,025 --> 01:03:42,276
It is now 7high's turn.

1256
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:52,495
It is now Kang Ji-yeong's turn.

1257
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:03,464
You have 30 seconds remaining.

1258
01:04:03,548 --> 01:04:05,591
Putting it like this
will be better for her.

1259
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:08,511
Ji-yeong should go here
and put a wall up here.

1260
01:04:08,594 --> 01:04:10,096
Then 7high has to block here,

1261
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:11,764
then she can bring this one down.

1262
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:18,896
Ten,

1263
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:20,064
nine,

1264
01:04:20,147 --> 01:04:21,232
eight,

1265
01:04:21,315 --> 01:04:22,608
seven,

1266
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:23,526
six,

1267
01:04:23,609 --> 01:04:24,527
five…

1268
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:27,154
It is now 7high's turn.

1269
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:40,543
-Oh, what was that?
-What is it?

1270
01:04:40,626 --> 01:04:42,044
I guess he's trying to block this.

1271
01:04:42,128 --> 01:04:44,881
To try and wall Ji-yeong off completely.

1272
01:04:44,964 --> 01:04:46,215
It is now Kang Ji-yeong's turn.

1273
01:04:58,477 --> 01:05:00,187
It is now 7high's turn.

1274
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:04,609
But Ji-yeong has got a lot.

1275
01:05:04,692 --> 01:05:06,652
She can secure nine spaces in there.

1276
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:09,196
It's nine, and even if she loses two,
it's still seven.

1277
01:05:16,787 --> 01:05:17,997
It is now Kang Ji-yeong's turn.

1278
01:05:25,379 --> 01:05:26,839
Yes, she could get another one.

1279
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:27,757
Oh, she could?

1280
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:29,216
Yes, one or two more squares,

1281
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:30,968
but that one is dead now.

1282
01:05:31,052 --> 01:05:32,637
-That's dead.
-You're right.

1283
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:34,263
Oh, dear.

1284
01:05:34,347 --> 01:05:35,598
It is now 7high's turn.

1285
01:05:40,645 --> 01:05:42,063
It is now Kang Ji-yeong's turn.

1286
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:50,780
It is now 7high's turn.

1287
01:05:53,491 --> 01:05:55,242
But this is really good.

1288
01:05:55,326 --> 01:05:57,745
Ji-yeong has effectively
made 7high abandon these two.

1289
01:05:57,828 --> 01:05:59,538
So right now, he doesn't have a move.

1290
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:03,292
So leaving counters in place
makes them like a wall.

1291
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:07,546
So I saw 7high's counters
gathered in the center.

1292
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:09,548
So, I thought I shouldn't yield the center

1293
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:12,510
and that I mustn't move these
no matter what.

1294
01:06:12,593 --> 01:06:14,095
You have 30 seconds remaining.

1295
01:06:27,858 --> 01:06:28,985
Ten,

1296
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:30,027
nine,

1297
01:06:30,111 --> 01:06:31,237
eight,

1298
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:32,446
seven,

1299
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:33,364
six,

1300
01:06:33,447 --> 01:06:34,281
five…

1301
01:06:36,283 --> 01:06:37,785
It is now Kang Ji-yeong's turn.

1302
01:06:37,868 --> 01:06:39,078
Why did he do that?

1303
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:42,248
Has he blocked that because he thinks
all this is his? What's going on?

1304
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:44,750
Ji-yeong has eight, nine, eleven.

1305
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:47,378
She'll win
if she just gets another five or six.

1306
01:06:47,461 --> 01:06:50,089
I think she's going to win
unless she makes a mistake.

1307
01:07:01,308 --> 01:07:04,478
I was trying to trap
the counters in the center

1308
01:07:04,562 --> 01:07:08,441
and made a mistake
by putting one in a bad spot.

1309
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:09,984
You have 30 seconds remaining.

1310
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:15,614
What the heck?

1311
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:18,200
Why? There's no wall breaker this time.

1312
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:20,202
Are they like this
because they're nervous?

1313
01:07:20,286 --> 01:07:21,704
Maybe they're just so tired.

1314
01:07:21,787 --> 01:07:24,665
Yes, it's difficult to think straight
when you play there.

1315
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:26,167
Why did she do that?

1316
01:07:27,251 --> 01:07:28,669
It is now 7high's turn.

1317
01:07:38,637 --> 01:07:39,722
Oh, no.

1318
01:07:40,681 --> 01:07:43,517
I was determined to stay put
and not give up the center,

1319
01:07:43,601 --> 01:07:47,104
and give myself room
to move in any direction as needed.

1320
01:07:47,188 --> 01:07:51,275
I was so absorbed in my thoughts
that I pretty much isolated myself.

1321
01:07:51,358 --> 01:07:52,777
You have 30 seconds remaining.

1322
01:07:56,947 --> 01:07:58,824
Ten, nine…

1323
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:01,577
It is now 7high's turn.

1324
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:05,081
This is the best option for 7high,

1325
01:08:05,164 --> 01:08:06,957
because it earns him three more squares.

1326
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:13,881
It is now Kang Ji-yeong's turn.

1327
01:08:16,133 --> 01:08:17,676
I hope Ji-yeong notices this.

1328
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:20,012
Exactly, that's her escape route.

1329
01:08:22,181 --> 01:08:23,057
Nice!

1330
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:24,266
Yes!

1331
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:25,392
Huh?

1332
01:08:25,476 --> 01:08:27,645
-But she could've gone further.
-There was no need for that.

1333
01:08:27,728 --> 01:08:29,230
She needed to block it later.

1334
01:08:29,313 --> 01:08:34,360
To be honest, I actually thought
about going further up and blocking it,

1335
01:08:34,443 --> 01:08:36,862
but thinking I might've gone too far up,

1336
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:38,155
suddenly I got scared.

1337
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:39,865
So I was overthinking things.

1338
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:42,201
You have to move that counter.
The one at the top.

1339
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:43,536
It is now 7high's turn.

1340
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:54,255
It is now Kang Ji-yeong's turn.

1341
01:08:57,091 --> 01:09:00,136
Nine, twelve.

1342
01:09:02,179 --> 01:09:04,056
Eighteen, nineteen, oh.

1343
01:09:16,193 --> 01:09:17,695
You have 30 seconds remaining.

1344
01:09:18,404 --> 01:09:20,114
I wanted to play the best possible move.

1345
01:09:20,197 --> 01:09:22,283
But time was passing,

1346
01:09:22,366 --> 01:09:24,410
and every time he was counting down,

1347
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:25,828
my heart was just…

1348
01:09:29,081 --> 01:09:30,875
Don't do it. Don't go there.

1349
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:31,876
Not there.

1350
01:09:31,959 --> 01:09:33,460
Why would you go there?

1351
01:09:39,884 --> 01:09:41,385
Ten,

1352
01:09:41,468 --> 01:09:42,595
nine,

1353
01:09:42,678 --> 01:09:43,846
eight,

1354
01:09:43,929 --> 01:09:45,431
seven…

1355
01:09:45,514 --> 01:09:46,724
It is now 7high's turn.

1356
01:10:00,237 --> 01:10:01,739
It is now Kang Ji-yeong's turn.

1357
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:18,881
You have 30 seconds remaining.

1358
01:10:24,261 --> 01:10:25,387
Ten,

1359
01:10:25,471 --> 01:10:26,680
nine,

1360
01:10:26,764 --> 01:10:27,932
eight,

1361
01:10:28,015 --> 01:10:29,308
seven,

1362
01:10:29,391 --> 01:10:30,601
six,

1363
01:10:30,684 --> 01:10:31,894
five,

1364
01:10:31,977 --> 01:10:33,312
four,

1365
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:34,230
three…

1366
01:10:34,313 --> 01:10:36,440
Put it underneath. Underneath.

1367
01:10:36,523 --> 01:10:38,525
Two, one…

1368
01:10:40,277 --> 01:10:41,278
Underneath.

1369
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:42,196
No, put it underneath!

1370
01:10:43,864 --> 01:10:44,907
Oh, no.

1371
01:10:45,407 --> 01:10:46,784
It is now 7high's turn.

1372
01:10:51,372 --> 01:10:52,665
GG.

1373
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:05,970
All counters are now walled off,
thus ending the game.

1374
01:11:06,053 --> 01:11:08,514
Here are the results of the game.

1375
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:13,143
Having gained the larger area,

1376
01:11:13,227 --> 01:11:16,397
7high has secured his survival.

1377
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:19,608
Having failed to secure her survival,

1378
01:11:19,692 --> 01:11:23,487
Kang Ji-yeong becomes the ninth player
eliminated from The Devil's Plan.

1379
01:11:23,570 --> 01:11:27,116
Kang Ji-yeong,
please leave this place immediately.

1380
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:31,453
I can't believe Ji-yeong is leaving.

1381
01:11:31,537 --> 01:11:33,289
It's such a shame.
I feel so sorry for her.

1382
01:11:37,459 --> 01:11:39,670
I'm used to this kind of competition,

1383
01:11:39,753 --> 01:11:43,340
so I don't feel sad or anything
about eliminations.

1384
01:11:43,424 --> 01:11:46,176
I've always just taken it
as part and parcel of the game.

1385
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:49,096
But I've experienced
a lot of things with Ji-yeong.

1386
01:11:49,179 --> 01:11:51,390
Like having
that ridiculous bread in prison

1387
01:11:51,473 --> 01:11:54,184
and also having a beer
together in the living area.

1388
01:11:54,268 --> 01:11:58,022
There was also the sense of helplessness
we felt together in the main game,

1389
01:11:58,105 --> 01:12:04,320
and after all that, I ended up
sending her home myself.

1390
01:12:04,403 --> 01:12:07,239
So I think it's the first time
I've felt like this.

1391
01:12:09,033 --> 01:12:10,951
I really…

1392
01:12:11,035 --> 01:12:15,831
I'm so glad we got the chance
to keep playing together. Honestly.

1393
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:20,002
I really hope you know that.

1394
01:12:24,631 --> 01:12:25,758
Everything's so vivid.

1395
01:12:25,841 --> 01:12:27,843
I keep thinking of
when I said goodbye to Justin

1396
01:12:27,926 --> 01:12:31,347
and putting Kyuhyun's counter
in the Devil space at the end.

1397
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:33,057
And of when I first came in here

1398
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:34,725
and saw Kyuhyun and thought,

1399
01:12:34,808 --> 01:12:38,437
"Oh, now things are getting real."

1400
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:41,690
And since I was eliminated while
trying my best in my own way at the games,

1401
01:12:41,774 --> 01:12:45,736
I don't have any anger or hard feelings.

1402
01:12:45,819 --> 01:12:47,071
In fact, I feel relieved.

1403
01:12:47,154 --> 01:12:51,116
My biggest regret is stepping aside
when we found the secret wall,

1404
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:55,371
and I think that led me
to this end result.

1405
01:12:55,454 --> 01:12:58,582
When it comes to
a contestant for the final…

1406
01:12:58,665 --> 01:13:00,250
Well, I definitely have a bias,

1407
01:13:00,334 --> 01:13:04,421
so I just hope that
either 7high or Eun-yu goes to the final.

1408
01:13:04,505 --> 01:13:09,510
Then I'll be cheering them on
no matter what.

1409
01:13:10,135 --> 01:13:11,136
Well played.

1410
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:12,471
See you the day after tomorrow.

1411
01:13:18,811 --> 01:13:20,771
That concludes the prison match.

1412
01:13:20,854 --> 01:13:24,066
7high, please return to the living space.

1413
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:26,443
You did well.

1414
01:13:42,626 --> 01:13:46,213
Honestly, I knew I'd feel like this
after it was over, but it's…

1415
01:13:46,296 --> 01:13:47,589
I had no idea.

1416
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:49,883
So, I'm feeling a bit out of it right now.

1417
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:53,679
It wasn't something we planned,

1418
01:13:53,762 --> 01:13:58,100
but somehow coincidentally,
Ji-yeong and I kept playing together.

1419
01:13:58,183 --> 01:14:00,477
And more than anything,

1420
01:14:00,561 --> 01:14:03,480
when the three of us played together,
how do I put it?

1421
01:14:03,564 --> 01:14:06,567
Our play was driven
by pent-up anger and grit…

1422
01:14:06,650 --> 01:14:07,776
Our play from rock-bottom.

1423
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:09,570
Yes, so I think it felt different

1424
01:14:09,653 --> 01:14:11,738
when the three of us played together.

1425
01:14:12,531 --> 01:14:14,116
To be honest,

1426
01:14:14,199 --> 01:14:16,076
I would've been really sad too

1427
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:19,872
if one of us got eliminated
for a mistake made in the main match.

1428
01:14:19,955 --> 01:14:23,959
But it happened while we competed
against each other in a prison match.

1429
01:14:24,042 --> 01:14:27,463
It's different from
losing in the main match and leaving.

1430
01:14:27,546 --> 01:14:30,716
So I really thought
this situation wouldn't happen today.

1431
01:14:31,341 --> 01:14:32,342
But…

1432
01:14:32,968 --> 01:14:36,513
Honestly, when Ji-yeong
comes back the day after tomorrow,

1433
01:14:36,597 --> 01:14:38,932
I think it will feel like
the opening of a treasure chest.

1434
01:14:39,016 --> 01:14:41,643
If one of the two of us is standing there.

1435
01:14:41,727 --> 01:14:43,479
When the treasure chest gets opened,

1436
01:14:43,562 --> 01:14:45,063
she has someone to cheer on.

1437
01:14:46,023 --> 01:14:48,400
Or maybe both of us will be sitting there.

1438
01:14:48,942 --> 01:14:50,068
Nobody knows.

1439
01:14:50,152 --> 01:14:52,863
When you say things like that,
it makes me feel so sad.

1440
01:14:52,946 --> 01:14:55,324
Like I have to live
up to her expectations.

1441
01:14:56,533 --> 01:14:58,368
But honestly, you're really amazing.

1442
01:14:58,452 --> 01:15:01,413
You've come through this five times now.

1443
01:15:03,248 --> 01:15:05,918
Tomorrow, I'd really love
to sleep in the living area.

1444
01:15:06,919 --> 01:15:10,297
-Then, you've made it to the final.
-I won't have any opportunity otherwise.

1445
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:13,175
It's ironic. I can't spend a night there
unless I make it to the final?

1446
01:15:13,258 --> 01:15:14,635
Oh? Yes.

1447
01:15:14,718 --> 01:15:18,347
If you don't make it to the final,
you can't change your clothes,

1448
01:15:18,430 --> 01:15:21,475
and you'll end the game with no make-up
and wearing a prison uniform.

1449
01:15:21,558 --> 01:15:23,769
Hey, what better motivation
is there than that?

1450
01:15:23,852 --> 01:15:25,979
-That's some motivation.
-That's so funny.

1451
01:15:26,063 --> 01:15:28,524
If Eun-yu claws her way into the final,

1452
01:15:28,607 --> 01:15:31,193
she'll be formidable.

1453
01:15:31,276 --> 01:15:32,194
Wow, if she does that,

1454
01:15:32,277 --> 01:15:34,196
then she'll be called
"Queen of the Prison."

1455
01:15:34,279 --> 01:15:36,490
Eun-yu really is amazing.

1456
01:15:36,573 --> 01:15:38,700
Just how scary is Eun-yu?

1457
01:15:38,784 --> 01:15:40,452
She's the Queen of the Prison,

1458
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:43,580
but the fact that she's really good
at maintaining her composure

1459
01:15:43,664 --> 01:15:46,083
makes me think she's really amazing.

1460
01:15:46,166 --> 01:15:48,919
I'm looking forward to going
up against her properly tomorrow.

1461
01:15:49,002 --> 01:15:52,673
I'm going to do my utmost to
ensure that we're still in 1st and 2nd.

1462
01:15:52,756 --> 01:15:54,466
Only the top two will survive tomorrow.

1463
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:56,343
So you have to protect your position.

1464
01:15:56,426 --> 01:15:57,553
Okay.

1465
01:15:57,636 --> 01:16:01,390
Still, today might have
turned out well for Hyun-gyu,

1466
01:16:01,473 --> 01:16:05,644
but I think it's meaningful
that So-hui lost a lot of her Pieces.

1467
01:16:05,727 --> 01:16:08,146
In any case, if it's a solo game,
then Hyun-joon's Pieces…

1468
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:10,691
But I'm not thinking
about things like that anymore.

1469
01:16:10,774 --> 01:16:12,109
-Really?
-In any case,

1470
01:16:12,192 --> 01:16:14,444
it won't be a fight
to take Pieces from each other.

1471
01:16:14,528 --> 01:16:16,822
It'll be more like a system
that weaponizes Pieces.

1472
01:16:16,905 --> 01:16:17,739
Right.

1473
01:16:17,823 --> 01:16:18,991
That's how games are.

1474
01:16:19,074 --> 01:16:21,785
If you manage to get a hit in,
another chance will follow.

1475
01:16:21,868 --> 01:16:24,663
And if your opponent makes
a mistake after that,

1476
01:16:24,746 --> 01:16:26,957
-you can get another chance.
-That's what we did today.

1477
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:28,208
Then they might go down.

1478
01:16:28,292 --> 01:16:32,588
But today, both sides
suffered a lot of damage.

1479
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:34,506
Because of Hyun-gyu.

1480
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:38,594
To be honest,
I've been thinking I was the villain.

1481
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:41,430
I thought, "Oh, why do I keep
doing such bad things?"

1482
01:16:41,513 --> 01:16:42,931
for the past five days.

1483
01:16:43,015 --> 01:16:46,101
But there was
a real villain hidden in plain sight.

1484
01:16:47,060 --> 01:16:48,437
I was nothing but a hoodlum.

1485
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:50,856
A hoodlum? Not a villain but a hoodlum?

1486
01:16:50,939 --> 01:16:52,941
I wasn't a villain, I was a hoodlum.

1487
01:16:53,025 --> 01:16:55,068
The real villain was someone else.

1488
01:16:55,152 --> 01:16:57,154
Well, to be honest, I was impressed

1489
01:16:57,237 --> 01:17:01,283
with all the moves
that Hyun-gyu made today.

1490
01:17:01,366 --> 01:17:02,743
And after that,

1491
01:17:02,826 --> 01:17:05,996
that stunt he pulled at the end
with the Pieces, yes, I was amazed,

1492
01:17:06,079 --> 01:17:09,291
but it wasn't because
he made a really great move.

1493
01:17:10,083 --> 01:17:11,877
I was just, "Wow, how can he…"

1494
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,754
"How can he go that far?"

1495
01:17:13,837 --> 01:17:16,965
Yes, but I think in some way,
that's pretty amazing too.

1496
01:17:17,049 --> 01:17:19,426
If you look at all this as one long game,

1497
01:17:19,509 --> 01:17:21,887
he's made a very good move there.

1498
01:17:21,970 --> 01:17:23,597
-It was the right choice. Yes.
-At the end…

1499
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:26,600
He had a golden ticket up his sleeve
and played it at the end.

1500
01:17:26,683 --> 01:17:29,686
So he made
the best choice for his survival.

1501
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:32,773
He put that as top priority.
He made the best choice.

1502
01:17:32,856 --> 01:17:35,275
Well, his moves were good,

1503
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:37,819
but there are people
who have been hurt and eliminated.

1504
01:17:37,903 --> 01:17:41,657
Tomorrow, 7high is probably
going to direct a lot of rage at you.

1505
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:43,867
But what did I even do?

1506
01:17:43,950 --> 01:17:45,827
He might attack me by sacrificing himself.

1507
01:17:46,328 --> 01:17:48,288
If I were 7high, I'd do that

1508
01:17:48,372 --> 01:17:50,374
to back Eun-yu up.

1509
01:17:50,457 --> 01:17:52,084
So I'm bearing that in mind.

1510
01:18:03,053 --> 01:18:06,765
Anyhow, things are very simple now.

1511
01:18:06,848 --> 01:18:08,475
The game has become very simple.

1512
01:18:08,558 --> 01:18:11,395
It's kill or be killed.

1513
01:18:12,354 --> 01:18:14,022
Have fun tomorrow.

1514
01:18:14,106 --> 01:18:16,108
So-hui and I are going to play together.

1515
01:18:16,191 --> 01:18:17,067
Without you.

1516
01:18:17,651 --> 01:18:18,610
Fine.

1517
01:18:19,528 --> 01:18:20,737
I'm telling you in advance.

1518
01:18:20,821 --> 01:18:21,863
Even then,

1519
01:18:21,947 --> 01:18:24,074
he was so honest and ruthless.

1520
01:18:24,157 --> 01:18:27,536
"Hyun-joon, I'm going to play
with So-hui tomorrow, not you."

1521
01:18:28,453 --> 01:18:32,124
You do your best, and I'll do mine.

1522
01:18:32,624 --> 01:18:34,668
In any case, I need to go
up against Hyun-gyu again,

1523
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:37,295
so I think it'll be fine
if I play with 7high and Eun-yu.

1524
01:18:37,379 --> 01:18:39,047
At least,
we'll be able to mount a defense.

1525
01:18:39,131 --> 01:18:41,591
Although he has
so many more Pieces than us,

1526
01:18:41,675 --> 01:18:42,801
I'll do my best.

1527
01:18:42,884 --> 01:18:44,511
You went through a lot today.

1528
01:18:44,594 --> 01:18:45,679
You went through more.

1529
01:18:45,762 --> 01:18:48,932
We need to be
in tip-top condition tomorrow.

1530
01:18:49,015 --> 01:18:51,309
Is that really possible in here?

1531
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:53,687
As best as we can in this situation.

1532
01:18:54,187 --> 01:18:56,398
If we get abalone porridge
tomorrow, I'll really enjoy it.

1533
01:18:56,481 --> 01:18:58,900
I want to eat samgyetang.

1534
01:18:58,984 --> 01:19:01,319
That would be great.
But it will never happen.

1535
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:05,198
I think the best we can
expect in here is abalone porridge.

1536
01:19:05,282 --> 01:19:07,075
I just miss meat,

1537
01:19:07,159 --> 01:19:10,537
like braised spicy chicken,
braised short ribs, and things like that.

1538
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:12,873
That'd be amazing.
I didn't think I was missing anything.

1539
01:19:12,956 --> 01:19:14,791
I thought I'd forgotten all about food,

1540
01:19:14,875 --> 01:19:17,127
but braised spicy chicken or short ribs?
Amazing.

1541
01:19:18,211 --> 01:19:19,087
Yikes.

1542
01:19:30,223 --> 01:19:31,183
Thank you.

1543
01:19:31,683 --> 01:19:33,059
What could it be?

1544
01:19:33,143 --> 01:19:34,186
I wonder what it is.

1545
01:19:35,187 --> 01:19:36,062
Hey.

1546
01:19:36,813 --> 01:19:38,231
Is it abalone porridge?

1547
01:19:38,982 --> 01:19:41,359
Isn't this beef and mushroom porridge?

1548
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:43,445
Oh, it is. It's mushroom porridge.

1549
01:19:43,528 --> 01:19:45,822
Three different types
of mushroom porridge now.

1550
01:19:45,906 --> 01:19:48,450
Darn it, I'm so depressed.

1551
01:19:50,035 --> 01:19:51,411
I was looking forward to it.

1552
01:19:51,495 --> 01:19:55,499
Still, at least
it has a bit of beef in it.

1553
01:19:56,625 --> 01:19:58,877
There's hardly any meat.

1554
01:20:15,852 --> 01:20:17,187
-Are you going to get up?
-Yes.

1555
01:20:17,270 --> 01:20:18,396
Did you sleep well?

1556
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:19,439
How about you?

1557
01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:21,691
-I slept well. Yes.
-You did?

1558
01:20:21,775 --> 01:20:22,734
I'm full.

1559
01:20:23,693 --> 01:20:25,695
No matter how much I eat, I feel empty.

1560
01:20:25,779 --> 01:20:28,073
No matter how much I eat,
I feel like I'm getting indigestion.

1561
01:20:29,282 --> 01:20:30,909
Wow, it doesn't feel real

1562
01:20:30,992 --> 01:20:33,078
that this is a set,

1563
01:20:33,161 --> 01:20:34,371
and we have to play a game in a bit.

1564
01:20:34,454 --> 01:20:35,831
It's the same every day.

1565
01:20:35,914 --> 01:20:39,543
Don't you think people change
the moment they leave this room?

1566
01:20:39,626 --> 01:20:40,627
That's what scares me.

1567
01:20:40,710 --> 01:20:44,256
The atmosphere here, the warm
atmosphere in prison, it all vanishes…

1568
01:20:44,339 --> 01:20:46,174
-Right.
-…and everyone is on their own.

1569
01:20:46,258 --> 01:20:48,677
Of course that's how it should be,
but still. Jeez.

1570
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:50,387
-It's not easy.
-No.

1571
01:20:50,470 --> 01:20:51,805
That door is the problem.

1572
01:20:51,888 --> 01:20:55,225
The moment we leave here
and enter the game area,

1573
01:20:55,308 --> 01:20:57,561
people change.

1574
01:20:57,644 --> 01:21:00,814
They're not their usual human selves.

1575
01:21:00,897 --> 01:21:01,898
Toss Sang-yeon out.

1576
01:21:01,982 --> 01:21:03,316
We need to just kill them all.

1577
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:04,860
I think we have no choice
but to go with them.

1578
01:21:04,943 --> 01:21:05,902
Do you know how to do arithmetic?

1579
01:21:05,986 --> 01:21:07,445
I'll be back tomorrow, so you wait.

1580
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:11,324
It's like they turn into
the most hideous version of themselves.

1581
01:21:11,408 --> 01:21:13,243
What exactly was that thing you did then?

1582
01:21:13,326 --> 01:21:16,872
When you and Justin
only had a few chips left,

1583
01:21:16,955 --> 01:21:18,373
what exactly did you do then?

1584
01:21:18,456 --> 01:21:21,126
How did you determine whether
it was the right time to go all-in or not?

1585
01:21:21,209 --> 01:21:22,794
To put it simply,

1586
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:25,714
when you judge that it's meaningless
to just raise one or two chips,

1587
01:21:25,797 --> 01:21:28,592
and you're better off doubling up,

1588
01:21:28,675 --> 01:21:29,968
you can use the strategy.

1589
01:21:30,051 --> 01:21:31,511
For example,

1590
01:21:31,595 --> 01:21:33,722
if you think that
after seeing two more cards,

1591
01:21:33,805 --> 01:21:35,849
there's a 50% chance
you'll have a good hand.

1592
01:21:35,932 --> 01:21:37,893
-Okay.
-Imagine a situation like this.

1593
01:21:37,976 --> 01:21:39,185
Someone has 150 chips,

1594
01:21:39,269 --> 01:21:41,313
another person has 30, you have 20,

1595
01:21:41,396 --> 01:21:42,731
and I have 10.

1596
01:21:42,814 --> 01:21:44,941
They have 150, 30…
Is that what our situation is now?

1597
01:21:45,025 --> 01:21:47,360
That's our situation.
That's why I'm giving this example.

1598
01:21:47,444 --> 01:21:48,653
So I go all-in.

1599
01:21:48,737 --> 01:21:50,071
But the other two fold.

1600
01:21:50,155 --> 01:21:51,281
It's just you left.

1601
01:21:51,364 --> 01:21:54,659
Now, you think you have a 50% chance
of developing your hand.

1602
01:21:54,743 --> 01:21:56,161
Or you might end up with nothing.

1603
01:21:56,244 --> 01:21:58,121
Now, do you think you can call?

1604
01:21:59,205 --> 01:22:00,874
-It's not easy.
-Right.

1605
01:22:00,957 --> 01:22:02,876
To be honest,
the strategy of going all-in…

1606
01:22:02,959 --> 01:22:05,170
You only use it against someone
who'd feel the pressure.

1607
01:22:05,253 --> 01:22:08,381
Then how do you go up
against the guy with 150 chips?

1608
01:22:08,465 --> 01:22:09,507
It's tough.

1609
01:22:10,133 --> 01:22:12,636
It's a long, drawn-out war.

1610
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:14,471
Games like that are really tiring.

1611
01:22:14,554 --> 01:22:16,723
You have to consider
how many chips you have

1612
01:22:16,806 --> 01:22:19,017
and decide whether to go
for a short, sharp game

1613
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:20,727
or try and drag things out.

1614
01:22:20,810 --> 01:22:24,189
I hope today's game will
be a long, drawn-out affair.

1615
01:22:24,272 --> 01:22:26,358
After all, aren't we going to be stronger

1616
01:22:26,441 --> 01:22:28,276
than the other two in a long fight?

1617
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:30,820
I actually think
it's a miracle we're still alive.

1618
01:22:30,904 --> 01:22:34,741
But I'm holding onto the hope
that such a miracle will occur again.

1619
01:22:34,824 --> 01:22:36,034
We must do what we can.

1620
01:22:36,117 --> 01:22:37,160
Right.

1621
01:22:37,243 --> 01:22:39,287
I wonder how fun today's game will be.

1622
01:22:39,871 --> 01:22:40,830
That startled me.

1623
01:22:40,914 --> 01:22:41,873
THE MAIN MATCH WILL BEGIN SHORTLY

1624
01:22:41,957 --> 01:22:43,375
You get startled every time.

1625
01:22:43,875 --> 01:22:46,169
The main match will begin shortly.

1626
01:22:46,252 --> 01:22:48,213
All players, please make
your way to the game area.

1627
01:22:48,296 --> 01:22:49,130
Let's do this!

1628
01:22:49,214 --> 01:22:50,131
Yeah!

1629
01:22:50,215 --> 01:22:51,049
We got this!

1630
01:22:51,132 --> 01:22:52,425
Let's have some fun.

1631
01:22:52,509 --> 01:22:53,593
Let's do this!

1632
01:22:53,677 --> 01:22:55,845
-Good!
-Something feels different today.

1633
01:22:56,429 --> 01:22:59,182
There's, like,
a higher tension in the air.

1634
01:23:01,101 --> 01:23:02,102
Great.

1635
01:23:02,185 --> 01:23:03,770
-Oh, it's betting.
-Yes.

1636
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:07,691
-Good morning.
-Now this is more like it. Hello!

1637
01:23:07,774 --> 01:23:09,192
Hi.

1638
01:23:09,275 --> 01:23:10,443
-I'm sorry, Eun-yu.
-Thanks.

1639
01:23:10,527 --> 01:23:11,528
What do you mean?

1640
01:23:11,611 --> 01:23:14,447
The Queen of the Prison is going to win.

1641
01:23:14,531 --> 01:23:16,533
-Cut it out, Hyun-gyu.
-We've been saying that all along.

1642
01:23:16,616 --> 01:23:17,617
Fourteen?

1643
01:23:17,701 --> 01:23:19,995
I was blown away when you got 14.

1644
01:23:20,078 --> 01:23:21,413
I had to solve an 8x8.

1645
01:23:21,496 --> 01:23:23,623
There was an 8x8 version
of A Knight's Tour?

1646
01:23:23,707 --> 01:23:25,041
6x6, 7x7, and 8x8.

1647
01:23:25,125 --> 01:23:27,669
That's amazing. Then you deserve them.

1648
01:23:28,294 --> 01:23:29,129
Thanks.

1649
01:23:29,212 --> 01:23:30,213
7high.

1650
01:23:30,296 --> 01:23:31,131
Hello.

1651
01:23:31,214 --> 01:23:33,133
Well played. I watched the Wall Go.

1652
01:23:33,216 --> 01:23:34,259
Hey, Hyun-joon.

1653
01:23:34,342 --> 01:23:36,261
I can't believe you're wearing denim.
It's hilarious.

1654
01:23:36,344 --> 01:23:37,429
I wore it on purpose.

1655
01:23:37,512 --> 01:23:38,596
-On purpose?
-Yes.

1656
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:40,473
After all, we'll be playing as a team.

1657
01:23:40,557 --> 01:23:41,808
Good morning.

1658
01:23:41,891 --> 01:23:46,146
The sixth main match of The Devil's Plan
will now begin.

1659
01:23:46,229 --> 01:23:49,816
Kang Ji-yeong was eliminated
during yesterday's prison match,

1660
01:23:49,899 --> 01:23:52,861
leaving just five players remaining.

1661
01:23:52,944 --> 01:23:54,446
Gosh, that's right.

1662
01:23:54,529 --> 01:23:56,406
Before the game begins,

1663
01:23:56,489 --> 01:23:59,743
here is the current Piece count
of each player now.

1664
01:23:59,826 --> 01:24:04,122
Currently,
Jeong Hyun-gyu has the most Pieces.

1665
01:24:04,956 --> 01:24:08,960
Here are the rules
of the sixth main match.

1666
01:24:09,753 --> 01:24:11,337
Today's main match is

1667
01:24:11,963 --> 01:24:13,381
Doubt and Bet.

1668
01:24:14,299 --> 01:24:15,467
Doubt and Bet is a game

1669
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:18,386
where players must predict
the number of cards of a certain color

1670
01:24:18,470 --> 01:24:21,514
or doubt your opponent's prediction.

1671
01:24:21,598 --> 01:24:26,519
The game is played
with a total of 60 cards;

1672
01:24:26,603 --> 01:24:31,983
10 each of red, yellow,
green, blue, purple and rainbow.

1673
01:24:32,609 --> 01:24:33,943
Before the game starts,

1674
01:24:34,027 --> 01:24:39,115
each player will be given
5 card slots and 4 slot chips.

1675
01:24:39,616 --> 01:24:43,328
The slots are the spaces where
players place the cards they are given,

1676
01:24:43,411 --> 01:24:47,415
and the slot chips are used
instead of the slots when they bet.

1677
01:24:48,083 --> 01:24:51,294
After thoroughly shuffling all 60 cards,

1678
01:24:51,377 --> 01:24:56,382
the dealer deals each player in turn
five cards face down.

1679
01:24:56,466 --> 01:24:59,761
When all players have
placed their cards in their slots,

1680
01:24:59,844 --> 01:25:03,264
the player going first
will make a prediction and a bet.

1681
01:25:03,890 --> 01:25:08,603
The player going first has
three minutes to make a prediction

1682
01:25:08,686 --> 01:25:11,231
on how many cards in total
of a certain color

1683
01:25:11,314 --> 01:25:14,025
are held by all players in their slots.

1684
01:25:14,692 --> 01:25:16,694
And rainbow cards

1685
01:25:16,778 --> 01:25:19,572
will be counted
as the color that was predicted.

1686
01:25:20,365 --> 01:25:21,449
After making their prediction,

1687
01:25:21,533 --> 01:25:25,703
the player will consider how much
to wage on it and place their bet.

1688
01:25:25,787 --> 01:25:29,499
The player will bet at least one Piece,

1689
01:25:29,582 --> 01:25:33,336
or may alternatively bet a slot.

1690
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:37,590
To bet a slot,
the player will use a slot chip.

1691
01:25:38,424 --> 01:25:42,220
If the player loses,
that slot will be withdrawn,

1692
01:25:42,303 --> 01:25:45,014
and in the next round, they will
only receive the number of cards

1693
01:25:45,098 --> 01:25:48,268
equal to the number of
slots they have available.

1694
01:25:49,185 --> 01:25:53,773
One slot is reserved
for participating in the game

1695
01:25:53,857 --> 01:25:56,109
and may not be wagered.

1696
01:25:56,192 --> 01:26:00,321
That is to say,
a maximum of four slot chips can be used.

1697
01:26:01,072 --> 01:26:03,575
After the first player has made
their prediction and bet,

1698
01:26:03,658 --> 01:26:06,202
the next player uses their turn to declare

1699
01:26:06,286 --> 01:26:09,455
that they either "accept"
or "doubt" the prediction.

1700
01:26:09,539 --> 01:26:10,999
Accept.

1701
01:26:11,082 --> 01:26:13,877
If they judge that the previous
player's prediction is correct,

1702
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:15,336
they will declare "accept."

1703
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:17,589
If they declare acceptance,

1704
01:26:17,672 --> 01:26:21,301
the Piece or slot chip
wagered by the previous player

1705
01:26:21,384 --> 01:26:22,927
is returned to them,

1706
01:26:23,011 --> 01:26:24,804
and the player who declared acceptance,

1707
01:26:24,888 --> 01:26:29,058
makes their own prediction and wager
in the same fashion.

1708
01:26:29,642 --> 01:26:32,145
At this stage,
the player must make a prediction

1709
01:26:32,228 --> 01:26:36,900
that is higher than the prediction
they have just accepted.

1710
01:26:37,567 --> 01:26:42,697
For example, if the previous player bet
that there were seven yellow cards,

1711
01:26:42,780 --> 01:26:47,827
the current player must bet that
there are at least eight yellow cards.

1712
01:26:47,911 --> 01:26:49,078
Because they accepted it.

1713
01:26:49,162 --> 01:26:52,290
At this time,
they may bet on the same color

1714
01:26:52,373 --> 01:26:54,209
or change to a different color.

1715
01:26:55,001 --> 01:26:56,336
Doubt.

1716
01:26:56,419 --> 01:26:59,839
If they judge that
the previous player's prediction is wrong,

1717
01:26:59,923 --> 01:27:03,635
they will declare that they "doubt" it,
and go up against that player.

1718
01:27:03,718 --> 01:27:05,136
Darn, it's a head-to-head duel.

1719
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:08,723
The doubting player can choose

1720
01:27:08,806 --> 01:27:11,559
to "raise" or "call" the previous player.

1721
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:14,520
If they choose to raise,

1722
01:27:14,604 --> 01:27:17,482
the player being doubted can choose

1723
01:27:17,565 --> 01:27:21,194
to raise, call or fold,

1724
01:27:21,277 --> 01:27:23,112
and betting will continue

1725
01:27:23,196 --> 01:27:26,616
until one of the players calls or folds.

1726
01:27:27,116 --> 01:27:29,911
When one of the two players folds,

1727
01:27:29,994 --> 01:27:33,164
the Pieces and slot chips wagered
are given to the other player,

1728
01:27:33,248 --> 01:27:37,502
and the round ends
without the cards being revealed.

1729
01:27:38,461 --> 01:27:40,838
If both players have
wagered the same number of chips,

1730
01:27:40,922 --> 01:27:42,590
and one of them calls,

1731
01:27:42,674 --> 01:27:45,593
all cards are turned face up.

1732
01:27:46,636 --> 01:27:50,556
If this reveals that the previous
player's prediction was wrong,

1733
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:53,226
the doubting player
has made a successful doubt

1734
01:27:53,309 --> 01:27:56,646
and receives
all the Pieces or slot chips wagered.

1735
01:27:56,729 --> 01:27:57,814
For example,

1736
01:27:57,897 --> 01:28:01,317
a player doubts a prediction
when at least five red cards

1737
01:28:01,401 --> 01:28:03,403
have been wagered.

1738
01:28:03,486 --> 01:28:05,905
If there are only four red cards

1739
01:28:05,989 --> 01:28:08,574
when the cards are revealed,

1740
01:28:08,658 --> 01:28:11,411
the player that made the bet loses the bet

1741
01:28:11,494 --> 01:28:14,622
and loses all the Pieces
and slot chips they wagered.

1742
01:28:15,290 --> 01:28:18,543
But if the player
that made the bet is correct,

1743
01:28:18,626 --> 01:28:22,171
that is to say there are at least the same
number of cards as was predicted or more,

1744
01:28:22,255 --> 01:28:23,506
the doubt fails,

1745
01:28:23,589 --> 01:28:26,718
and the player that instituted the bet
gets all the Pieces and slot chips

1746
01:28:26,801 --> 01:28:28,177
that were wagered.

1747
01:28:28,261 --> 01:28:32,223
At this time, slot chips that were bet
are converted into Pieces.

1748
01:28:32,307 --> 01:28:34,058
Oh, you receive Pieces, not slots.

1749
01:28:34,142 --> 01:28:36,352
Moreover, at any point during the game,

1750
01:28:36,436 --> 01:28:39,314
players may exchange Pieces for slots
and vice versa.

1751
01:28:39,981 --> 01:28:41,941
When exchanging slots for Pieces,

1752
01:28:42,025 --> 01:28:45,069
you can only receive
as many slot chips as there are slots.

1753
01:28:45,737 --> 01:28:48,948
It is not possible
to have more than five slots.

1754
01:28:49,032 --> 01:28:50,241
Oh, that's the max.

1755
01:28:50,908 --> 01:28:53,369
When the match-up is over, the round ends,

1756
01:28:53,453 --> 01:28:56,080
and all players will return their cards.

1757
01:28:56,706 --> 01:28:58,958
The cards are then shuffled

1758
01:28:59,042 --> 01:29:02,337
and dealt to the players
in as many slots as they have,

1759
01:29:02,420 --> 01:29:04,297
and the game continues.

1760
01:29:05,214 --> 01:29:08,634
The order of play for Round 1
will be decided by drawing lots,

1761
01:29:08,718 --> 01:29:12,513
and from Round 2, the player
that lost the bet will go first.

1762
01:29:13,389 --> 01:29:14,682
If someone is eliminated,

1763
01:29:14,766 --> 01:29:18,686
the player directly before them
will go first,

1764
01:29:18,770 --> 01:29:21,522
and players will swap places
every ten rounds.

1765
01:29:22,482 --> 01:29:26,235
Additionally, after the end of round 15,

1766
01:29:26,319 --> 01:29:29,530
every five rounds, all players
will relinquish one Piece each.

1767
01:29:30,156 --> 01:29:31,366
What the…

1768
01:29:31,449 --> 01:29:32,492
Looks like fun.

1769
01:29:32,575 --> 01:29:35,995
If a player loses all their Pieces,
they are eliminated,

1770
01:29:36,079 --> 01:29:39,540
and the game will continue
until three players remain.

1771
01:29:39,624 --> 01:29:40,875
When there's three left?

1772
01:29:40,958 --> 01:29:42,168
When the game is over,

1773
01:29:42,251 --> 01:29:46,547
each player will be given one Piece
for each slot they still have in play.

1774
01:29:46,631 --> 01:29:48,758
At this time,

1775
01:29:48,841 --> 01:29:52,637
the player with the most Pieces
will advance to the final match.

1776
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:55,932
The other two players will go to prison.

1777
01:29:56,015 --> 01:29:57,642
The prison's still in play today?

1778
01:29:57,725 --> 01:29:59,644
Come on, don't be like that.

1779
01:29:59,727 --> 01:30:02,397
The game will start in 30 minutes.

1780
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:03,940
That's a bit harsh, Mr. Dealer.

1781
01:30:04,023 --> 01:30:06,401
Spend this time as you wish.

1782
01:30:06,484 --> 01:30:08,528
I might go back to prison?

1783
01:30:08,611 --> 01:30:11,322
If I spend tonight in prison,
I suppose that's a good thing.

1784
01:30:11,406 --> 01:30:12,740
"God, there's still prison?"

1785
01:30:14,117 --> 01:30:15,785
That's what struck me the most.

1786
01:30:16,411 --> 01:30:18,454
But the next thought I had was,

1787
01:30:19,205 --> 01:30:21,916
"Wait, it's not so bad."

1788
01:30:21,999 --> 01:30:24,168
All I have to do is
finish in the top three,

1789
01:30:24,252 --> 01:30:28,214
and after that,
I can just play the prison match.

1790
01:30:28,297 --> 01:30:30,675
I thought that was better for me.

1791
01:30:30,758 --> 01:30:34,470
I thought this might be a game
which might send me home sooner,

1792
01:30:34,554 --> 01:30:37,140
but it also might be
the only game that would give me

1793
01:30:37,223 --> 01:30:39,308
a chance of making it to the final.

1794
01:30:39,392 --> 01:30:40,768
So it's not that bad.

1795
01:30:40,852 --> 01:30:44,397
We need to work together.
Information is king.

1796
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:46,149
-Of course.
-Let's talk with Hyun-joon.

1797
01:30:46,232 --> 01:30:48,151
-Let's talk.
-7high, come over here.

1798
01:30:48,234 --> 01:30:50,278
It looks like those three
are going to work together.

1799
01:30:50,361 --> 01:30:53,072
-What?
-I think those three are working together.

1800
01:30:53,156 --> 01:30:54,824
Anyhow, he was very open.

1801
01:30:54,907 --> 01:30:57,452
Last night he actually said,
"I'm not going to play with you."

1802
01:30:57,535 --> 01:30:59,120
So, the three of us have to play together.

1803
01:30:59,203 --> 01:31:01,122
-Of course we will.
-Yes, well, precisely.

1804
01:31:01,205 --> 01:31:02,540
In a game of five people,

1805
01:31:02,623 --> 01:31:05,168
three people sharing information
is a huge benefit.

1806
01:31:05,251 --> 01:31:08,504
It's a great advantage.

1807
01:31:08,588 --> 01:31:11,257
So we can use
that information to gain chips.

1808
01:31:11,340 --> 01:31:14,093
So ultimately, hopefully
it's them that will be eliminated.

1809
01:31:14,177 --> 01:31:17,513
Pro-poker player 7high,

1810
01:31:17,597 --> 01:31:20,266
Goddess of the Prison Eun-yu, and me…

1811
01:31:20,349 --> 01:31:22,977
What am I?
Just someone that survived the prison.

1812
01:31:23,060 --> 01:31:24,687
The three who have been to prison

1813
01:31:24,770 --> 01:31:26,522
versus the two who haven't.

1814
01:31:26,606 --> 01:31:28,149
Of course, we might
end up being eliminated.

1815
01:31:28,232 --> 01:31:32,862
Still, our objective is to show
how desperate we can get.

1816
01:31:32,945 --> 01:31:35,281
I think a lot will be
decided by the order of play.

1817
01:31:35,364 --> 01:31:37,283
Yes, I thought it'd
be a completely individual game.

1818
01:31:37,366 --> 01:31:38,326
It is.

1819
01:31:38,409 --> 01:31:39,410
But it ended up like this?

1820
01:31:39,494 --> 01:31:42,038
I didn't think
we'd split up to talk like this.

1821
01:31:42,121 --> 01:31:44,916
We have a lot of Pieces,
so we can work together,

1822
01:31:44,999 --> 01:31:47,001
but those guys can't.

1823
01:31:47,502 --> 01:31:49,754
So-hui and I each have a lot of Pieces,

1824
01:31:49,837 --> 01:31:52,715
so we're thinking of
applying pressure from Round 15 on.

1825
01:31:52,798 --> 01:31:55,009
We tough it out to Round 15,

1826
01:31:55,092 --> 01:31:57,345
and they're bound to be divided.

1827
01:31:57,428 --> 01:32:01,182
And I'm hoping to see 7high in danger

1828
01:32:01,265 --> 01:32:03,768
so that they turn against each other.

1829
01:32:03,851 --> 01:32:05,645
If we do this, it's so simple.

1830
01:32:05,728 --> 01:32:07,522
We just need to share what we have

1831
01:32:07,605 --> 01:32:09,482
-with each other.
-Exactly.

1832
01:32:09,565 --> 01:32:12,026
We just have to play
a game of guessing ten.

1833
01:32:12,109 --> 01:32:13,986
-That's better than having to guess 15.
-Yes.

1834
01:32:14,070 --> 01:32:15,613
But how do we share?

1835
01:32:15,696 --> 01:32:17,532
We get them, then write it down,

1836
01:32:17,615 --> 01:32:19,909
and then, during those three minutes,

1837
01:32:19,992 --> 01:32:21,994
we can gather together and share.

1838
01:32:22,078 --> 01:32:24,539
So there are six colors.

1839
01:32:24,622 --> 01:32:28,209
Let's assume that the 25 cards
are evenly distributed to some extent.

1840
01:32:28,292 --> 01:32:30,878
That means there are
about four of each color, right?

1841
01:32:30,962 --> 01:32:32,213
Then eight on average.

1842
01:32:32,296 --> 01:32:34,423
Since the rainbow cards
are equivalent to plus four.

1843
01:32:34,507 --> 01:32:35,591
It doubles up any color.

1844
01:32:35,675 --> 01:32:37,301
So we can calculate to some degree.

1845
01:32:37,385 --> 01:32:38,553
This is important.

1846
01:32:38,636 --> 01:32:39,554
It’s eight on average?

1847
01:32:39,637 --> 01:32:41,514
Because, it's an average of four,

1848
01:32:41,597 --> 01:32:44,016
and the rainbow just adds four
to everything.

1849
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:46,227
-Right. So it's an average of 4.33.
-To everything?

1850
01:32:46,310 --> 01:32:48,771
Because if I choose blue,
the rainbow cards are blue,

1851
01:32:48,854 --> 01:32:50,690
if I choose red, then they're red.

1852
01:32:50,773 --> 01:32:52,817
Then, it's better
if we get a lot of rainbow cards.

1853
01:32:52,900 --> 01:32:54,735
-For sure. That's the best.
-Right.

1854
01:32:54,819 --> 01:32:57,822
And it's good for us to be
at one extreme or the other.

1855
01:32:57,905 --> 01:32:59,198
Either absolute none,

1856
01:32:59,282 --> 01:33:00,658
or an absolute truckload.

1857
01:33:00,741 --> 01:33:02,243
Either a lot or none
of a particular color.

1858
01:33:02,326 --> 01:33:04,120
They will go for "true" in the beginning.

1859
01:33:04,203 --> 01:33:05,913
-They can't bluff.
-You're probably right.

1860
01:33:05,997 --> 01:33:10,418
Since they have to play it safe,
they're just going to go for true.

1861
01:33:10,501 --> 01:33:13,796
So, if we're bluffing and they doubt me?

1862
01:33:13,879 --> 01:33:15,214
If they doubt, just call.

1863
01:33:15,298 --> 01:33:16,841
Yeah, just call it.

1864
01:33:16,924 --> 01:33:18,968
If they doubt you on three,

1865
01:33:19,051 --> 01:33:20,386
just give it to them.

1866
01:33:20,469 --> 01:33:22,680
-Right.
-Right? You only lose one chip.

1867
01:33:22,763 --> 01:33:25,725
But once they start leaning,
we just keep raising.

1868
01:33:25,808 --> 01:33:29,061
Right, I'm going to raise them every time.
I've just going to go for them.

1869
01:33:29,145 --> 01:33:30,771
I think they're mostly just going to call.

1870
01:33:30,855 --> 01:33:32,732
I'm just going to go for it all.

1871
01:33:32,815 --> 01:33:35,109
I'm going to be eliminated anyway.
I'm mentally prepared.

1872
01:33:35,192 --> 01:33:36,694
You're going for it right from Round 1?

1873
01:33:36,777 --> 01:33:37,903
I'm a Poker player.

1874
01:33:38,738 --> 01:33:40,906
I don't bluff when I'm in a tight spot.

1875
01:33:40,990 --> 01:33:44,660
Just don't forget, your slots are
like energy to our alliance.

1876
01:33:44,744 --> 01:33:45,828
I'm very aware.

1877
01:33:45,911 --> 01:33:49,582
It's my life, so I'll do my best.
Don't worry. I won't do anything stupid.

1878
01:33:49,665 --> 01:33:51,542
We can just bluff once in a while.

1879
01:33:52,043 --> 01:33:56,922
So, if I bet a slot chip and lose it,
I lose the slot itself, right?

1880
01:33:57,006 --> 01:33:59,216
For example, if I lose two slot chips,

1881
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:01,385
then do I lose the slots as well?

1882
01:34:01,469 --> 01:34:07,350
Players can use their slot chips
to wager card slots instead of Pieces.

1883
01:34:07,433 --> 01:34:11,145
However, if they lose the slot chip,
they also lose the slot itself,

1884
01:34:11,228 --> 01:34:13,230
which reduces the information they have

1885
01:34:13,314 --> 01:34:16,108
and makes subsequent predictions
more difficult.

1886
01:34:16,609 --> 01:34:19,320
When we start taking their slot chips,
we're on the road to victory.

1887
01:34:19,403 --> 01:34:20,821
Right.

1888
01:34:20,905 --> 01:34:24,408
But I think the order of play
is going to be so important.

1889
01:34:24,492 --> 01:34:27,620
If the three of them are
one after the other…

1890
01:34:27,703 --> 01:34:29,664
-The worst-case scenario would be this.
-…it's not easy.

1891
01:34:29,747 --> 01:34:31,624
Two, one… If we're stuck like this.

1892
01:34:31,707 --> 01:34:33,918
Exactly. I'm worried
that's going to happen.

1893
01:34:34,001 --> 01:34:36,379
Then someone definitely
has to doubt someone.

1894
01:34:36,462 --> 01:34:38,047
-That’s how the game ends.
-Exactly.

1895
01:34:38,130 --> 01:34:40,549
If we're in a row,

1896
01:34:40,633 --> 01:34:44,053
it won't be bad to shut it down
exchanging a Piece.

1897
01:34:44,553 --> 01:34:47,431
You can make strange doubts,
but also accurate doubts.

1898
01:34:47,515 --> 01:34:49,141
We can exchange them back and forth.

1899
01:34:49,225 --> 01:34:51,602
Right, you can guess it spot on
or incorrectly.

1900
01:34:51,686 --> 01:34:54,313
Then I'll raise two and just get it wrong.

1901
01:34:54,397 --> 01:34:57,024
Let's hope we're playing in a row
so our strategy works.

1902
01:34:57,108 --> 01:34:58,109
Right.

1903
01:34:58,192 --> 01:34:59,777
-It's a war of attrition.
-Yes.

1904
01:34:59,860 --> 01:35:01,904
We need a bit of luck.

1905
01:35:01,987 --> 01:35:02,822
Right.

1906
01:35:02,905 --> 01:35:04,323
We need a good place.

1907
01:35:05,741 --> 01:35:07,576
This is going to be fun.

1908
01:35:08,411 --> 01:35:11,122
Let's make it to the final. Whoever it is.

1909
01:35:11,205 --> 01:35:13,249
Your time is up.

1910
01:35:13,332 --> 01:35:15,292
Please gather in the hall.

1911
01:35:16,210 --> 01:35:17,086
Let's do this!

1912
01:35:17,169 --> 01:35:18,504
We can turn things around.

1913
01:35:19,463 --> 01:35:20,840
All three of us might make it.

1914
01:35:20,923 --> 01:35:22,341
That's really possible.

1915
01:35:24,343 --> 01:35:25,344
Goodness.

1916
01:35:26,053 --> 01:35:27,346
This is going to be fun.

1917
01:35:28,889 --> 01:35:31,976
You will now draw lots
to determine the order of play.

1918
01:35:32,059 --> 01:35:32,977
Please.

1919
01:35:36,689 --> 01:35:37,940
Oh, nice.

1920
01:35:38,023 --> 01:35:40,985
It'll be just a bit hard to communicate,
but we got good positions.

1921
01:35:45,865 --> 01:35:47,366
Is Hyun-gyu going first?

1922
01:35:47,450 --> 01:35:49,201
Hey, Hyun-gyu, honestly.

1923
01:35:49,702 --> 01:35:52,121
Hey, Hyun-joon,
wouldn't you be better off joining us?

1924
01:35:52,204 --> 01:35:54,498
-What?
-At least prison would be guaranteed.

1925
01:35:54,582 --> 01:35:56,542
He's at it again.

1926
01:35:56,625 --> 01:35:58,210
You said you wouldn't play with us.

1927
01:35:58,294 --> 01:35:59,587
You can come to us.

1928
01:36:01,046 --> 01:36:02,047
No, thanks.

1929
01:36:02,715 --> 01:36:04,091
I will now shuffle the cards.

1930
01:36:08,596 --> 01:36:10,765
Today, I'm even more certain.

1931
01:36:10,848 --> 01:36:15,936
So-hui and I are aiming for the top two.

1932
01:36:17,521 --> 01:36:19,690
Having made it this far, I'd better win.

1933
01:36:19,774 --> 01:36:21,650
I want to get to the final, at least.

1934
01:36:23,277 --> 01:36:27,406
I'm proud of myself
for making it this far from prison.

1935
01:36:27,490 --> 01:36:31,035
I just hope Hyun-gyu won't lose.
I want to help him as much as I can.

1936
01:36:32,828 --> 01:36:36,540
I'm in a very unfavorable position
right now with just two Pieces.

1937
01:36:36,624 --> 01:36:40,586
So I'm going to put my life
on the line and do my best.

1938
01:36:41,462 --> 01:36:45,341
Round 1 of Doubt and Bet will now begin.

1939
01:38:30,404 --> 01:38:35,159
What's more, Kyuhyun must have left
thinking he died a hero's death.

1940
01:38:35,242 --> 01:38:37,453
Don't you think
Kyuhyun's aware of it? Wouldn't he?

1941
01:38:37,536 --> 01:38:39,872
-I don't think he knows. Would he?
-How could he?

1942
01:38:39,955 --> 01:38:43,250
Did any of the others know about
your reward? That it was ten Pieces?

1943
01:38:46,503 --> 01:38:48,631
Can I let you in on a secret?

1944
01:38:48,714 --> 01:38:51,175
-A secret? About where you went?
-Yes.

1945
01:38:51,258 --> 01:38:54,053
I solved it with just a minute left
and got ten Pieces.

1946
01:38:55,095 --> 01:38:58,474
But I get the Pieces
whenever I ask for them.

1947
01:38:58,557 --> 01:39:00,726
If I yell out,
they'll give them to me straightaway.

1948
01:39:02,144 --> 01:39:05,272
So I've got a reason to never go to jail.

1949
01:39:05,356 --> 01:39:06,941
Wow, that's amazing.

1950
01:39:07,024 --> 01:39:08,692
I wanted to tell you and So-hui.

1951
01:39:08,776 --> 01:39:09,610
Okay.

1952
01:39:09,693 --> 01:39:11,236
I'll give you more if I get them.

1953
01:39:11,320 --> 01:39:14,073
Don't. Please don't.
I want you to get through.

1954
01:39:14,156 --> 01:39:16,033
-Still, I hope you--
-I hope you don't end up in prison.

1955
01:39:16,116 --> 01:39:18,369
Still, I hope you do well until the end.

1956
01:39:18,452 --> 01:39:20,037
-But you never know.
-That's amazing.

1957
01:39:20,120 --> 01:39:21,789
Wow, that's amazing.

1958
01:39:21,872 --> 01:39:24,708
That means you're practically immortal.

1959
01:39:24,792 --> 01:39:26,835
Then who do you want to end up last?

1960
01:39:26,919 --> 01:39:29,630
-Do we have to decide that right now?
-Yes.

1961
01:39:29,713 --> 01:39:34,510
I want to get rid of Hyun-joon
because of Hyun-gyu.

1962
01:39:34,593 --> 01:39:36,387
But I think Hyun-gyu is going to win.

1963
01:39:36,470 --> 01:39:38,013
Hyun-gyu is going to win for sure.

1964
01:39:38,097 --> 01:39:41,600
-Because he's just that strong right now.
-Because… Yes, he is.

1965
01:39:41,684 --> 01:39:42,768
Then let's target Hyun-gyu.

1966
01:39:42,851 --> 01:39:43,978
Then we should do that.

1967
01:39:44,061 --> 01:39:46,188
If we don't, I think he'll get through.

1968
01:39:46,271 --> 01:39:49,525
If we can send him to prison,
we can eliminate him there, right?

1969
01:39:51,819 --> 01:39:55,489
But there's nothing
wrong with that, right?

1970
01:39:56,323 --> 01:39:59,493
I don't want to reveal

1971
01:39:59,576 --> 01:40:04,123
Hyun-gyu's reward by killing him.

1972
01:40:05,207 --> 01:40:07,418
"You practically have one more life,

1973
01:40:07,501 --> 01:40:10,629
so you can lose a life
and start over with the ten Pieces."

1974
01:40:10,713 --> 01:40:14,508
But is it really right to ask that of him?

1975
01:40:14,591 --> 01:40:17,261
And I felt a little sorry for him

1976
01:40:17,344 --> 01:40:20,097
battling all alone against six players,

1977
01:40:20,180 --> 01:40:21,515
so I wanted to help him.

1978
01:40:22,266 --> 01:40:25,227
