1
00:00:06,297 --> 00:00:08,133
On the Blue Team, it was…

2
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:10,635
Kyuhyun.

3
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,303
CORRUPT POLICE REVEAL
NONE, KYUHYUN, HYUN-GYU

4
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,732
Good job!

5
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,154
6 HOURS EARLIER

6
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:30,864
We just need two anyway.

7
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:32,866
One.

8
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:33,908
Me?

9
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:35,994
-I think there is a way.
-I see.

10
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:39,539
This premise assumes
that one of us is a thief. No matter what.

11
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:41,458
I'll know who is corrupt on the Red Team.

12
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,626
I can let you know who it is.

13
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,503
So, if one of us is a thief…

14
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:47,839
-Let's share information.
-That's it.

15
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:50,175
CORRUPT POLICE
BLUE TEAM NO. 4

16
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:51,342
I hate it.

17
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:54,512
I'm a goody two shoes.
You won't find a speck of dirt on me.

18
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:55,930
I'm a corrupt officer.

19
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:58,600
-There isn't one on Red.
-There isn't?

20
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:00,518
I got together with 7high and Tinno

21
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:03,938
right from the beginning
because we were of the same mind.

22
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:06,733
I'm most anxious about Hyun-gyu.

23
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,818
He's also a corrupt officer,

24
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,321
but he could oust
the thieves or me as well.

25
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:12,947
I'm a corrupt officer.

26
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:15,575
I guess there's no point in asking.
Ordinary officer?

27
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:19,788
If the thieves betray us, we're screwed.

28
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:21,539
We just have to trust them.

29
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:24,667
We, thieves, have agreed
to trust the corrupt officers.

30
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,669
Trust them no matter what. Okay?

31
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:30,673
If the thieves are cold and calculating,
they should snitch on us, given the gains.

32
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,217
We have to hope they won't.

33
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,677
There is no corrupt officer on our team.

34
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,554
How do you know that we don't have one?

35
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:39,516
To be honest, I teamed up with others
before the game started.

36
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,518
That's why I'm giving you this intel now.

37
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:45,688
And if there's anything else
we can negotiate, I'll share that as well.

38
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:52,195
One of the thieves will tell us
what the other one is doing.

39
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,699
Round 1 will now begin.

40
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,618
Move two spaces.

41
00:01:58,701 --> 00:01:59,577
Then, I will too.

42
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:00,745
Move two spaces.

43
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,956
Stations 53 and 74.

44
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:05,083
Stations 53 and 74.

45
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,709
Red Team police officers,

46
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:10,171
you have five minutes
to execute your moves in order.

47
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,549
I'm going to slide down on this turn.

48
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,634
Because No. 3 has this area
covered right now.

49
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:16,761
From above and the side.

50
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:17,971
I'll investigate Station 55 as well.

51
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:20,014
Moving to Station 55 and investigating.

52
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,224
Please check for a clue.

53
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,143
CLUE DISCOVERED

54
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:25,937
I'm not very good at lying.

55
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,480
I just can't do it.

56
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:30,275
Nothing.

57
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:32,652
Is it this way?
Are they down at the bottom?

58
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:35,113
He's going to come
and say there is nothing.

59
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:37,323
Great job.
Kyuhyun's doing well. He's a gamer.

60
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,242
I will investigate Station 54 and 53.

61
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,326
Please check for a clue.

62
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,286
Nothing.

63
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:42,996
Moving to Station 53 and investigating.

64
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:43,997
Nothing.

65
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,207
The blue subway line
is also a bit suspicious.

66
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,585
Because they can come
and go as they please.

67
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,253
Because no one is there.

68
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,922
They might even be here.
They can move two at a time.

69
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,425
So even with clues here,
we don't know where they went.

70
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,052
Especially if the clues are here,
that would be really difficult.

71
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,306
The two corrupt officers have
the same idea.

72
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:04,100
Keep themselves close to the thieves

73
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:08,104
and lead the other police officers
far away.

74
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,690
Blue Team No. 2 moves to Station 71.

75
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:13,109
Now, she'll see my tracks.

76
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,111
There will be a clue.

77
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,030
-Is that where we started?
-Yes.

78
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:18,323
They'll find that for sure.

79
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:20,450
Yes, it's no fun
if they don't find anything.

80
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,869
That concludes Round 2.

81
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:25,079
Round 3 will now begin.

82
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,456
-CHUU.
-Yes?

83
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,666
Please go up. And I'll go this way.

84
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,710
Then, shall we go up and turn left?

85
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:32,545
I'll just go straight then.

86
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,631
Please, Lord CHUU.

87
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:35,840
I'll go to Station 40.

88
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,342
-Really?
-She's going back.

89
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:38,384
Really?

90
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,136
-Good for us.
-No way, she just…

91
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,429
Wow, CHUU.

92
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:44,724
Since Tinno is one of the thieves,

93
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:47,352
the plan was to try and catch
the other thief, So-hui.

94
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:48,645
That was my original strategy.

95
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,439
Tell me how I can catch her.

96
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,983
Then, I'll end up dead too.

97
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,777
I'm telling you, you won't get caught.

98
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,780
It'll be like that for you too,
with the Red Team.

99
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:02,116
I'm taking So-hui with me.
It was around the same time.

100
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,826
If Kyuhyun was an ordinary officer,

101
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,912
he would have ousted the corrupt
and we'd be done.

102
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:07,372
They'll use us as insiders

103
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:09,791
to get all the Pieces
to split among the four of them.

104
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:13,169
And if we don't go after them,
they'll come save us later. That's it.

105
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,047
We have to pray
Hyun-gyu doesn't get caught.

106
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,298
If he does, we can't do anything.

107
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,384
-We'll do our best to save you.
-Yeah.

108
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:23,972
In return for helping the thieves
and the corrupt officers,

109
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,474
7high is planning to ensure
being placed in the living area

110
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:28,643
for himself and two members
of the Red Team.

111
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:31,646
If either of the corrupt officers
are exposed,

112
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:34,190
this plan will fail.

113
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:39,070
My main goal is to ensure neither
of the corrupt officers are caught.

114
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:46,327
Red Team No. 1 moves to Station 25.

115
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,537
Why did he go back to Station 25?

116
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,871
That's weird.

117
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,249
-There's definitely a saboteur on Red.
-Red keeps acting oddly…

118
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:52,709
What the? Why is he going there?

119
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,711
Is the whole Red Team corrupt?

120
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,296
I think they're acting really weird.

121
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,341
Red Team No. 1 moves to Station 98.
Arrest failed.

122
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,552
Moves to Station 99. Arrest failed.

123
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,470
-Arrest failed.
-Who's that?

124
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,723
It feels like one person is just moving
for moving's sake.

125
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,641
I think they're moving aimlessly.

126
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:09,934
Are they being manipulated?

127
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,602
I had to stoke the flames

128
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:14,314
and make it seem like a corrupt cop
was on the Red Team but not ours.

129
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:18,151
Red Team No. 3 moves to Station 130,
moves to Station 90.

130
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:19,610
Back? They're going there?

131
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,904
Red Team is making
everything so difficult.

132
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,448
I'm getting annoyed.

133
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:25,074
They're going backward.

134
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,492
They definitely planned this.

135
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:29,620
What's up with Red Team?
They're helping too much.

136
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,581
Because they keep making wrong moves,

137
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:34,584
Blue and Green's faith
in Red Team has disappeared.

138
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,210
-Red is weird.
-Red's weird, right?

139
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:37,587
They've been strange.

140
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,589
-We were saying that.
-Red must be a mole.

141
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,175
But anyway, we have
to be wary of the thieves,

142
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:45,345
so out there, don't show
any intention of trying to catch them.

143
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:48,306
If they ask why we aren't,
just pin it all on me.

144
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:49,766
Our team strategy is clear.

145
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,935
We make people believe
there's a corrupt officer on our team

146
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,645
and we make them think it's me.

147
00:05:58,775 --> 00:05:59,817
Do you trust 7high?

148
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,409
Everyone is looking at me so coldly.

149
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:11,120
It was our strategy
for everyone to hate us.

150
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,915
It seems like it worked. I'm satisfied.

151
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:17,794
The only variable is whether or not
Kyuhyun gets exposed.

152
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,712
Our team has a corrupt officer.

153
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,048
Someone snitched
about one being on my team.

154
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,008
They're not here right now.

155
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:26,344
-For real?
-Yes, for real. I told you.

156
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:27,720
I hinted that it's CHUU.

157
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,180
They're convinced it's CHUU.

158
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:30,681
Is it CHUU?

159
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,226
Got one!

160
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:34,727
-What? Where?
-At Station 18.

161
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:38,147
I'd already forgotten
the fact that I was a corrupt officer.

162
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:41,567
I just thought of myself
as an ordinary police officer.

163
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:42,985
I was intentionally fooling myself.

164
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:47,281
I'd prefer the corrupt officers confess
so we can move this conversation along.

165
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:48,324
Station 74.

166
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,369
Moving to Station 74 and investigating.
Please check for a clue.

167
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:52,412
There's nothing here.

168
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:54,122
There's nothing here.

169
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:55,706
Nothing here?

170
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,543
-There's a clue at Station 36.
-There is?

171
00:06:58,626 --> 00:06:59,669
Shall I make an arrest?

172
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:02,630
If I had said there was a clue
when I'd already said that there wasn't,

173
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:04,590
that would be a bit suspicious.

174
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,635
But if I discover it first,
they don't really suspect me.

175
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:11,806
We got them.
Got clues at Stations 17 and 18.

176
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:13,599
Then, that means it's not Kyuhyun.

177
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,351
Because Kyuhyun keeps finding clues.

178
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,561
He's not corrupt.

179
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:19,397
At least one of us is corrupt,
but I don't think it's Kyuhyun.

180
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,857
Right, we thought that, too.

181
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,316
He doesn't seem to be lying.

182
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,153
The vote for the corrupt officer
will now commence.

183
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:28,406
Personally, I don't think we have
one on our team…

184
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:32,243
Why didn't you just say you were ordinary?

185
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:34,745
-Oh, for me too…
-I didn't understand.

186
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,956
That troubled me as well…

187
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,167
I don't think it's either one of you.

188
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,585
I have no idea who it might be.

189
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:43,212
I voted for Kyuhyun.

190
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,380
I'm sorry.

191
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,467
I've spoken to no one
since the game started.

192
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,469
But if you're really not,
I will apologize.

193
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,387
-You'll have to apologize.
-No matter what.

194
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,098
Kyuhyun.

195
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:57,393
To start, I was a corrupt officer.

196
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,104
I considered the two thieves
and the two corrupt officers

197
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:02,690
to be on the same side.

198
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:06,569
And I thought 7high was on our side
because he helped out a lot.

199
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:10,031
I thought if I had chosen to expose
that I was a corrupt officer,

200
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:12,450
that would have been a huge betrayal.

201
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,285
Please wait a moment.

202
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,829
KANG JI-YEONG

203
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:21,209
I might get betrayed in a future match,
but at the moment,

204
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,794
I'm putting all my faith
in the people on my side.

205
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:27,089
On the Green Team, it was Jeong Hyun-gyu.

206
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:32,303
On the Blue Team, it was Kyuhyun.

207
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:41,938
Of the 12 Pieces secured by the thieves,

208
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:45,942
half of them will be given
to the two corrupt officers.

209
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,109
Give him half.

210
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,695
Ji-yeong, I'm so sorry. Wait.

211
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,989
How could you lie right to the bitter end?

212
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,866
-I'm really sorry.
-I was sorry at the end there.

213
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,368
But you played really well.

214
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:56,911
Sorry. I'm really sorry, CHUU.

215
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:59,038
It was a random draw.
I didn't have a choice.

216
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,499
I'm so sorry.

217
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:06,546
I never imagined it would be Kyuhyun.

218
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:07,797
Ji-yeong, I…

219
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:12,009
Ji-yeong… At the end, I really…

220
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:15,596
-You really are something.
-I'm so sorry.

221
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,432
Can I trust anything he says now?

222
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:21,269
Someone who denied it 10, 20 times?

223
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,980
In conclusion, I blame myself.
I was too naive.

224
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,022
We have hope.

225
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,734
We trusted each other.

226
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:32,113
We succeeded.
We did our best given the conditions.

227
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:34,115
Okay, we've come this far.

228
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:36,701
Keep your promise.
If you don't, I will bury you.

229
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:39,120
Depending on the results of the game,

230
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:42,039
here is the current Piece count
of each player now.

231
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:43,874
CURRENT PIECE COUNT

232
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,585
They reap all the rewards.

233
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,838
Here are the prize mission results.

234
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:51,757
The game finished during Round 11.

235
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,760
As a result, 80 million won
has been added to the prize fund.

236
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,137
TOTAL ACCUMULATED PRIZE FUND
80,000,000 WON

237
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:01,142
Ten players have
the same number of Pieces.

238
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:02,643
The players with the most Pieces,

239
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:03,644
Kyuhyun,

240
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:04,770
Jeong Hyun-gyu,

241
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,063
Yoon So-hui,

242
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,273
and Tinno,

243
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:11,068
please choose three players
who will go to the living area.

244
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,029
I'll try to save you.

245
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:13,988
Please do.

246
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:19,118
Please save us.
Then, I will be a really good assistant.

247
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:21,537
I want to bring over
as many teammates as I can.

248
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,789
If these three end up going to jail,

249
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:27,001
I think they'll come back at me
with knives sharpened.

250
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:30,212
First, you helped us so much.
You really played well.

251
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,632
I would like to take
one person from my team.

252
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,176
But we have to take 7high because…

253
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:36,552
We agreed.

254
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:40,014
So, if I had my way…

255
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:45,519
If Kyuhyun and Hyun-gyu
hadn't played so well,

256
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:48,856
I would've stuck to my decision,
even if it meant making enemies of them.

257
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:53,861
From where I stand,
they're on a similar level to 7high.

258
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:56,072
-We made it all happen.
-Right.

259
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:59,116
If you don't stick to the agreement,
then you've lost all four of us.

260
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,410
Assume you've lost all of us,
including me.

261
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,997
But the thing is, I only have one vote.
I am fighting for you.

262
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,166
That's why I present my case to the group.

263
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:09,627
My team facilitated it all
and made it happen.

264
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,587
We strategized from the beginning

265
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,298
to help them avoid suspicion
and we followed through.

266
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:15,633
So, please don't forget that.

267
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,551
-That's all I have to say.
-We understand.

268
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:20,096
We carried it out because we thought

269
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:24,558
three out of four being saved
would be a pretty good outcome.

270
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,060
Did you promise him Pieces?

271
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:28,270
No, just safeguarding.

272
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,730
You promised to save them?

273
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,528
That's what I don't understand.

274
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:40,658
If they had something like that going on,
they should have cut me loose.

275
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,285
Or brought me in.

276
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,246
But…

277
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:48,416
Still, I just wish
we could each have a vote.

278
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,168
Okay, let me try and talk to them.

279
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:55,047
What Hyun-gyu said made sense.
I wasn't unsympathetic.

280
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,049
But from where we stand,

281
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:00,594
the people left behind will be furious
if just the Red Team is saved.

282
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,638
-Of course.
-That much is obvious.

283
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:06,434
Let's tell them we strongly opposed it
and that we decided to split the saves.

284
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,019
-Split it?
-Yes.

285
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:12,231
To be honest, I thought
helping Red was the right thing to do.

286
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:14,442
Because they helped us in the game.

287
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:15,401
There are four of us.

288
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:17,862
I made my case
for you and Kyuhyun supported me,

289
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:20,865
but the other two are against it.

290
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,241
We're deadlocked two to two.

291
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:24,285
I'm trying to persuade them,
but it's dragging on.

292
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:26,579
So, are you saying
you'll only save me from my team?

293
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:28,038
They're saying one from each.

294
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,708
That makes no sense.
That's going back on your word.

295
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,501
Tell them that'll make me their enemy.

296
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:34,962
I won't stand for it.

297
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,508
I mean, we strategized secretly.

298
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,343
We didn't share. They had no idea.

299
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,511
This is no easy task.

300
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:45,848
Is this the deal we made earlier?

301
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,850
This is something totally different.

302
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,101
Can you handle me?

303
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:52,354
If this is what you decide,
I will go to prison.

304
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,941
And when I come back,
I will destroy all of you, for sure.

305
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,152
His eyes were like this.

306
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:01,447
He's just trying
to protect his own team as well.

307
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:02,782
I can't convince Hyun-gyu

308
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:06,368
because he played really well
by himself without knowing any of this.

309
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,912
That's right. But…

310
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:09,622
Then, how about one person?

311
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:13,250
Otherwise, I think there'll
be a severe rift between us and them.

312
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,419
Hyun-gyu has a point.

313
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:18,839
All of the Blue and Green teams
would end up in the prison block.

314
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:22,551
He's just trying to avoid
having everyone end up as enemies.

315
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,095
We didn't ask for this. We did our best.

316
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,806
Okay. Proceed as you will then.

317
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,390
Then, who do you want to send?

318
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,475
Pick whoever you like.

319
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:33,229
You sort it out between yourselves.
That's not for me to decide.

320
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,815
So, talk amongst yourselves
and make a decision.

321
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:38,067
In any case, save two of us.

322
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,485
-Okay?
-Deal.

323
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:46,033
Two from Red and the last,
these two will need to fight it out.

324
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,165
I'm really sorry. This is just…

325
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,294
-Sorry. We know how much you helped.
-Nah.

326
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:59,672
It can't be helped.
I understand the situation.

327
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:02,258
It's just a part of the game.
Nothing to be sorry for.

328
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,385
-Just don't forget.
-No doubt.

329
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:06,303
-For sure. I got you.
-You can go ahead.

330
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:07,805
What are we going to do?

331
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:08,931
Hyun-gyu and I…

332
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,140
Do it. Decide.

333
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,726
I tried my best. Sorry.

334
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:16,105
Well, it's not like you can force them.

335
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,816
I couldn't just walk over to them

336
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:22,736
and tell them directly
that I was helping them.

337
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,198
He promised to save
three people from our team,

338
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:29,577
but seeing as he didn't keep that promise,

339
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,078
I'm very wary of Tinno.

340
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,791
This must be giving them a headache too.

341
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,879
-How about playing the ladder game for it?
-Sure.

342
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,755
A part of me wanted to avoid it,

343
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,384
but I also wanted to try
to make sure it was a group decision.

344
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:47,428
Okay, Let's go. Come on!

345
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,769
Let's see.

346
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:56,687
It's here, right?

347
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:02,151
Wow, so that's the result.

348
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,153
Let's go.

349
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,783
First…

350
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,830
we've decided on 7high.

351
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,916
I was a bit upset

352
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:21,378
because I thought
maybe we didn't get the result we wanted

353
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,255
due to my poor negotiating skills.

354
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:27,593
For our second choice,
we choose Park Sang-yeon.

355
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,679
I couldn't just feel happy about it.

356
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:35,225
I was saved, but my two teammates weren't.

357
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:41,398
-Hyun-gyu, you pick one more person.
-Okay.

358
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,984
I will pick Lee Se-dol.

359
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,194
-Me?
-Yes.

360
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:48,072
Can I pass it to someone else?

361
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,991
-Yes.
-Really?

362
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,201
-Just like that?
-You're passing it up?

363
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,535
I pick Ji-yeong.

364
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:57,081
What a hero. I can't believe it.

365
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:58,290
Seriously?

366
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,833
Really?

367
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,126
I felt bad about earlier.

368
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:05,297
I went to Blue Team
and said something unnecessary.

369
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,423
I don't think it's Kyuhyun.

370
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,800
Right, we thought that, too.

371
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:09,259
He doesn't seem to be lying.

372
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:14,264
I said, "I don't think it's Kyuhyun.
It's definitely not him."

373
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:16,392
-What the heck?
-My goodness.

374
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:19,728
-Se-dol, are you sure?
-Jaw-dropping.

375
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,106
I'm sorry about what I said earlier.

376
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:23,107
No way.

377
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:26,860
I'm also slightly sorry to Ha-rin,
but much more…

378
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:29,029
I realized how sly I am.

379
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:33,492
The right thing to do would have been
to ask him why he chose me.

380
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:35,077
But all I could think was,

381
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,163
"Great, I've survived for now.
Now to make them pay."

382
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:42,835
I also really want to pay Se-dol back
for giving me this gift, this opportunity.

383
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:44,086
He's so amazing.

384
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,004
He is.

385
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,881
Two people in prison last season.
There are seven now.

386
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:50,259
-How great is that?
-Let's go together.

387
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:53,137
The living area
and prison block assignments

388
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,763
have been finalized.

389
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:55,806
Lee Seung-hyun,

390
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:56,974
Justin Min,

391
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,100
Choi Hyun-joon,

392
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,184
Kim Ha-rin,

393
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,227
Son Eun-yu,

394
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,770
Lee Se-dol, CHUU,

395
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,773
please make your way to the prison block.

396
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,942
-Make sure you make it back alive.
-Okay.

397
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,318
Show your power.

398
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,536
-See you soon.
-Bye.

399
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:19,163
-Bye.
-We'll be back soon.

400
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:20,789
Make sure you do.

401
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,291
One won't be returning.

402
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,001
I mean…

403
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:26,003
Even their outfits have changed.

404
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:27,963
I feel like I've really committed a crime.

405
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:32,426
I'm shaking. How can anyone play
another game in this state?

406
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:34,386
-It closes?
-It's coming down?

407
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,971
So, it closes like this.

408
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,097
I'm so scared.

409
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:38,098
Bye!

410
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:39,600
-Good luck.
-Bye.

411
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:46,690
No!

412
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:47,816
This is really…

413
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,151
Honestly.

414
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:52,738
Rest of the players, please make
your way to the living area.

415
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,740
You did great. Well done.

416
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:57,701
The Red Team really went
through the wringer. I feel bad.

417
00:17:57,785 --> 00:18:01,330
-I'm feeling nervous about this bucket.
-Are they going to put it on our heads?

418
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:02,331
What's this for?

419
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:03,373
What now?

420
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,501
I will now collect any personal items.

421
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:06,877
Our pens and notepads, too?

422
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,754
Yes, I will collect all pens and pads.

423
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:10,214
I thought they were going
to throw water on us.

424
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,466
-Any more?
-Personal items?

425
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:14,093
-Go that way? Okay.
-This way.

426
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,137
I feel like
the prison has become more decrepit.

427
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,223
Doesn't it feel like a dank basement?

428
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:21,141
This is a bit much.

429
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,810
So many cobwebs.

430
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,353
What is all this?

431
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,897
-It's not bad.
-It's pretty nice.

432
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,108
It's nice?

433
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:32,069
-It's better than I thought.
-It's pretty good.

434
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:35,572
Hey, everyone!
Here in prison, we will find the light!

435
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,575
-Sounds good.
-Great.

436
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:40,702
This is ridiculous.

437
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,329
What the heck? I like it.

438
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:44,289
It's like a movie set.

439
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,457
Yeah, the ceiling…

440
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,375
It's amazing.

441
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,376
It's nice.

442
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,460
It's perfect.

443
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,295
-What's this?
-A place to wash up?

444
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,588
There is something.

445
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:52,548
For one person?

446
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:57,469
Players in the prison block
may change into the provided clothes.

447
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:58,762
Change clothes?

448
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,556
Hey, they gave us prison uniforms.

449
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:04,226
The prison match will begin at 8:30 p.m.

450
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:07,312
Spend this time as you wish until then.

451
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,314
We're going to kill it
with these uniforms.

452
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,984
But the uniforms are
actually quite trendy. It's denim!

453
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:13,277
It's surprisingly trendy.

454
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,529
It goes quite well with my skin tone.

455
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:18,157
Sky blue happens to be my personal color.

456
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,284
Everyone who was born
in 1999 is here, right?

457
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,369
The '99 babies are all here.

458
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,413
The rabbit party we were talking about…

459
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:27,040
I feel terrible. Honestly.

460
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,917
These room assignments!

461
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,170
Jeez. That's wild.

462
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,713
What a stroke of fate.

463
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:35,841
We played our first game today,

464
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,676
but we can't just celebrate that.

465
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,011
We're all exhausted.

466
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:40,971
I was hungry, but I lost my appetite.

467
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:42,931
-It's completely gone.
-Right?

468
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,100
I felt pretty down, to be honest.

469
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,811
My teammates were in prison. Se-dol too.

470
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,522
I think the next round will be
very important.

471
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,149
Nothing in life is easy.

472
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:54,026
And it's only our first day.

473
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:56,778
To be honest,
when I was watching last season…

474
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,281
-You wondered why they were so intense.
-Yeah, exactly.

475
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,575
But now that I'm here, I'm the same.

476
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:03,577
I feel terrible just after one game.

477
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,078
-You become so close.
-So close.

478
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,580
It's really fascinating.

479
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:10,792
Still, we both made it through.

480
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:14,922
I feel a bit icky.

481
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,006
Icky, that's right.

482
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,966
You did what you were supposed to do.

483
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,218
I suppose.

484
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:22,095
I played my part faithfully
and worked hard.

485
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,431
But it turned out that everything was

486
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:26,683
led by political insiders
wheeling and dealing.

487
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,770
It made me feel
a bit insulted and embarrassed.

488
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:32,439
I see they've stuck us together.

489
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:33,482
It's all fate.

490
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:34,733
You know how it is, right?

491
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,652
It's just a game.

492
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,028
Of course.

493
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:41,198
I said I wasn't confident
about going one-on-one.

494
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:43,992
But if it is, I think
that'll be pretty nerve-racking.

495
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,119
No, it's one-on-one.
I think it's one-on-one.

496
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,204
THE KNIGHT'S TOUR

497
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:50,415
If it's one-on-one, I'll be nervous.

498
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,459
It'll depend on the game, though.

499
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,836
-Shall we play?
-There's another one.

500
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,298
But isn't this for one player?

501
00:20:58,382 --> 00:20:59,675
-Something feels off.
-Right?

502
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:03,136
-It's the same.
-Exactly the same.

503
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,847
-What's this?
-"Wall Go" and "Knight's Tour."

504
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:09,101
But normally, this is the final game.

505
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:10,852
-It was last time, right?
-Yes.

506
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,730
They left it here so we can practice
for a level playing field.

507
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,607
It must mean something, right?

508
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:18,735
Let's play this all night
after dinner and the game.

509
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,783
Are you studying?

510
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:27,035
I'm playing this board game.

511
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:29,288
You start anywhere and…

512
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:30,580
-Do you know the knight?
-Yes.

513
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:33,083
You have to move like a knight
and fill the board in.

514
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:36,753
Does a knight move like this?

515
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:39,923
Two spaces forward
and then, one space left or right.

516
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,301
Two spaces forward,
and one space left or right.

517
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,511
There are 5x5, 6x6, and 7x7 grids.

518
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:48,765
So, if you can't fill them all in,
then you fail.

519
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:50,017
Fill them all in, you win.

520
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,769
Then, should the four of us take
one each and try it?

521
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,480
This is such an honor.

522
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,024
Is this the counter?

523
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,442
You have two counters.

524
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:03,905
"You have to take turns to move
your counter and build walls."

525
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,991
I still don't quite get it.

526
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:07,617
I'm having difficulty grasping it.

527
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:09,828
-What are we gonna do about our game?
-I'm zonked out.

528
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:12,539
There was no need for me
to bring any of my gym stuff.

529
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:13,790
They even have a clock.

530
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:16,877
But it's the wrong time.

531
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,047
Are they all like that?

532
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:37,439
None of them are right.

533
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:44,321
Why give us clocks
that are set to the wrong time?

534
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:35,247
THE DEVIL'S PLAN
DEATH ROOM

535
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:40,168
It was strange.

536
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,546
Why would they build this expensive set

537
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:44,589
and forget the clock batteries?

538
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,550
So I opened it up,

539
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:48,593
and there were these codes, so…

540
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:49,845
Seriously?

541
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,888
There aren't any secrets
in this prison, right?

542
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:35,515
Last time, there was a padlock.

543
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:41,271
It does look like there's nothing, right?

544
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:42,647
There's just nothing.

545
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:45,942
Is there even a spot for a drawer?

546
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,153
Just personal drawers.

547
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:49,112
Maybe here?

548
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:52,365
What if it's nothing?

549
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:53,325
What's that?

550
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:55,368
-A puzzle?
-I thought you could just lift it.

551
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:59,414
If there is a secret in here,
I want to know what it is.

552
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,461
-Let's check under our noses again.
-Se-dol, what are you doing?

553
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:06,296
I thought maybe there was something.

554
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:09,132
I don't think they hid anything here.

555
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:11,092
There's bound to be something.

556
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:14,471
Can we break out of jail?
I think it might be possible.

557
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:16,389
Maybe it'll just open and we can go out.

558
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:17,891
Nope.

559
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,102
What the heck? What's this?

560
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:23,897
Do you think this is some kind of hint?

561
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,857
-Do you think this is a hint?
-Really?

562
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:28,026
I didn't use any force, and this happened.

563
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:30,445
Maybe we put
this in a hole somewhere and turn it?

564
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:31,571
No, that's…

565
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:33,073
This is nothing.

566
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:34,533
I don't think that's anything.

567
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:35,951
Something's not right.

568
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:37,994
Let's just leave it.

569
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:39,371
What can this be?

570
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,336
"Devil."

571
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:49,381
If this lines up, I think it'll move up.

572
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:50,507
Right?

573
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,967
What's this hole for?

574
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:56,972
Poke it with a diffuser stick?

575
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,100
Nope.

576
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,477
What could it be?

577
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:07,857
Not gonna eat dinner?

578
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,234
Lost your appetite?

579
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,194
What?

580
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:14,739
I found something,
but I don't know what it is.

581
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,658
The clock was dead.

582
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,369
There's one in your room.

583
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:20,579
Okay, there are letters.

584
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:21,621
Yes, letters, but…

585
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:22,581
How many?

586
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:24,165
Five.

587
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,376
You could treat it as four.

588
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:29,421
-Because there are one, two, three, four.
-But they're connected.

589
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,630
They can all turn.

590
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,424
-C-L…
-The top one doesn't turn.

591
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:34,009
That leaves us three.

592
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:37,804
What five-letter English words are there?
Something with C-K? Clock?

593
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:39,723
That ends in C-K.

594
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,433
Did it open?

595
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:43,351
Nope.

596
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,020
S-N-A…

597
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:46,313
Snake? Bingo?

598
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:49,190
S-N-A…

599
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,276
Wait, that's not C-K. What is it?

600
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:53,111
Snake. My English skills are…

601
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,114
Snake. K-E…

602
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:57,574
There's no K-E.

603
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:59,326
But what's the hole for?

604
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:00,702
Who have you told?

605
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,120
I haven't told anyone.

606
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:04,914
There's a Piece in here for sure.
Don't you think?

607
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,167
Just one Piece.

608
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:09,294
Everything is upside down.

609
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:12,672
They had stuff like this
in the prison last time. It's here now.

610
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,090
They must have something too.

611
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:15,133
Something in both.

612
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:19,262
But everyone will end up
looking at their clocks at some point.

613
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:20,680
I actually brought my own,

614
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:24,142
but the time didn't match up,
that's why I looked at it.

615
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:26,102
Everyone will do so eventually.

616
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:28,438
So it might be better
to just solve it together.

617
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:29,981
Shall we?

618
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:33,068
A thug would sweep up all the Pieces.

619
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,194
If it's inside there?

620
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:36,321
Exactly. Someone could sweep them all up.

621
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:37,364
Yikes!

622
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:41,034
If you think about it,
they've given us one Piece each.

623
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:41,951
Yeah, maybe.

624
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:44,037
This might be our only chance.

625
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,081
-We might be in prison tomorrow.
-Today's our only day.

626
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,624
-Dinnertime.
-Let's eat.

627
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:51,002
-This looks really great.
-Let's all eat together.

628
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,879
-Bon appétit!
-Enjoy!

629
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:54,631
-Let's dig in first.
-Talk later.

630
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:56,257
First proper meal of the day.

631
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,301
We all survived the first day.

632
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,138
It's really tasty.

633
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,348
Really delicious.

634
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:04,349
That hits the spot.

635
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:08,061
What are they eating in prison?

636
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:11,606
I'm sure it's decent. Can't be just bread…

637
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:12,982
Bread. It's bread.

638
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,818
That must be for one person.

639
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:16,111
There's more coming, right?

640
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,278
Sir!

641
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:20,031
At least, give us some cup ramyeon.

642
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:24,828
Wow, it's whole grain with nuts.

643
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:26,079
It's really good.

644
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:27,497
Is this it? Our dinner?

645
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:32,836
To be honest, the bread was quite dry.

646
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:35,004
I thought I might be too hungry to focus,

647
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:37,507
but because it was dry,
I drank four cups of milk.

648
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,717
It was really good.

649
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,179
What the heck? Now?

650
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:44,431
It's eight o'clock.

651
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:47,809
The prison match will begin in 30 minutes.

652
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:48,977
That startled me.

653
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,396
Oh, jeez.

654
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:55,066
The prison match will begin in 30 minutes.

655
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:55,984
Okay.

656
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:58,611
They're letting us know what's going on.

657
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:01,781
At the end of the prison match,
one player will be eliminated

658
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,867
and leave The Devil's Plan.

659
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:06,077
-That woke me up.
-No, I don't want to.

660
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:09,080
Here are the rules
for the first prison match

661
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:12,333
that will decide who is eliminated first.

662
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:15,795
The first prison match
in The Devil's Plan is

663
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,213
Remove One.

664
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:18,673
"Remove One."

665
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:19,591
What is it?

666
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:24,637
Remove One is a game where you play
one of your two selected number cards

667
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:29,350
and the player who plays
the lowest number wins a point.

668
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:35,690
Each player will be given a deck
of cards numbered from 1 to 8.

669
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,400
You have to count cards.

670
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:38,651
When the game starts,

671
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:42,197
each player will select
two cards from their hand

672
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:46,785
and place them face down
in the boxes on the playing table.

673
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:47,994
It's a solo game.

674
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:51,289
After their cards are placed,
all the cards will be turned over

675
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:53,124
at the same time.

676
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:56,795
When the cards are revealed,
each player will select a marker

677
00:29:56,878 --> 00:30:01,174
to indicate which card will be
their final submission.

678
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:05,804
Players will be forbidden from looking
or showing their marker.

679
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:06,930
I see, in secret.

680
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:08,181
After the selection,

681
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:11,518
players will simultaneously reveal
the markers they are holding

682
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:13,978
and the corresponding card
will be submitted.

683
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:19,234
After excluding all cards
of the same value,

684
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:22,237
the player who submitted
the lowest unique number

685
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,364
will be declared the winner of that round.

686
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:26,616
So if multiple people play 1,
it's out of the equation.

687
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:27,951
This is a game of wits.

688
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:29,702
The winning player will be awarded

689
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:32,872
the number of points equivalent
to the number on the winning card

690
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:34,999
and a victory token.

691
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:39,879
The final submission cards
will be discarded

692
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:43,925
and the remaining cards
will be placed in the holding boxes.

693
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:47,178
The cards in the holding boxes

694
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:50,974
may not be used in the following round.

695
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:52,141
It skips a turn?

696
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:54,727
The game will consist of 18 rounds.

697
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,312
Seriously, 18 rounds?

698
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,773
At the end of Rounds 6 and 12,

699
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,942
all remaining cards will be returned,

700
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:05,530
and all players will be issued
fresh decks.

701
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:13,997
Rounds 3, 6, 9, 12, and 18
are survival rounds,

702
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:18,209
and total points will be calculated
after those rounds end.

703
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:22,630
Players who have victory tokens
at the end of each survival round

704
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:26,885
will receive one additional point
for each victory token.

705
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:30,889
The player with the highest number
of accumulated points

706
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:34,183
will be removed from the game
with their survival guaranteed.

707
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:36,644
-In Round 3?
-This is going to be nerve-racking.

708
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,605
After the scores are calculated,

709
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:41,441
all remaining players will have
their scores reset.

710
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:42,901
They get reset?

711
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:43,902
That's crazy.

712
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:46,821
However, all players will retain
their victory tokens.

713
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,240
If multiple players have
the same number of points,

714
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:53,244
the one with the most victory tokens
shall earn survival.

715
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,788
If the number of victory tokens
also overlaps,

716
00:31:55,872 --> 00:32:00,376
whoever won a round most recently
shall earn survival.

717
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:04,839
At the end of Round 18,
the last survival round,

718
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,634
two players will earn survival.

719
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:13,806
The player with the highest score
among the three remaining players

720
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:16,351
will receive one Piece as a reward.

721
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:17,810
Wow, but right at the end?

722
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:19,270
Survive to the end?

723
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:22,023
The player who fails to secure survival

724
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:25,818
will lose all of their Pieces
and be eliminated from The Devil's Plan.

725
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:29,948
The game will begin in 30 minutes.

726
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:33,868
If you want that Piece,
you have to cling on until the very end.

727
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:36,579
It'll be quite thrilling
to go all the way.

728
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:40,083
I suppose a lot of people will try
to get points on the board early on.

729
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:42,877
-Right--
-You can't use the same card twice.

730
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,380
If you lose a strong card
because it's a duplicate,

731
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:47,090
it'd be a huge loss early on.

732
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:48,466
It's giving me a headache.

733
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,641
Did they have to show that now?

734
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:57,684
Exactly.

735
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:59,143
They could've done it earlier.

736
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:04,816
But if you get a whole bunch of points
by Rounds 9 or 12.

737
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:06,567
-You mean victory tokens?
-Yes, that.

738
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,444
Then, you might want to go for Round 18,

739
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,279
after checking the token scoreboard.

740
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:12,865
Still, I wouldn't want
to stick around until the end.

741
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:15,994
-But with that game…
-Can people make alliances in that?

742
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,245
It won't be easy.

743
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:18,997
They said it had to be secret.

744
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,290
So, you can discuss it
before submitting it.

745
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:24,252
I think you can talk about it.
Just not the markers.

746
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:27,088
Alliances will be difficult
because it should be like…

747
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:31,342
It can't be "I helped you last time,
so you help me next time."

748
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:33,594
Right. Because you would leave the game.

749
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,471
Then, they can't help you at all.

750
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:37,640
But you can still help within that round.

751
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,018
This is…

752
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:40,935
Why?

753
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,687
It's very tense.

754
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:43,855
Tense?

755
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:46,774
I don't think it'll be that easy to lose.

756
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,276
It's hard to lose?

757
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,862
I mean, you'll have
a 1-in-7 chance of losing.

758
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:52,405
He's rubbing off on you.

759
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:55,575
"I'm not confident that I can lose."

760
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:57,577
Shall we talk about that?

761
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,911
-Sure.
-While we have time.

762
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:01,622
-He discovered something huge.
-What?

763
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,332
-Hang on a sec.
-What is it?

764
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:05,209
Everyone had a clock in their room.

765
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:09,672
Unless I steal all those clocks
and hide them somewhere,

766
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:11,174
I'd have gotten caught anyway.

767
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:13,259
So I figured, let's just share it ASAP

768
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:15,595
and put our heads together to solve them

769
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:17,597
as a collaborative mission.

770
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:20,600
Wow, you brought all of them?

771
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:23,352
I couldn't carry them all. There's more.

772
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:24,687
Take these.

773
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:27,523
It's better to get ahead of it
and take credit for it.

774
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:31,235
I opened it up
and it looks like this inside.

775
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:33,446
-What is it?
-It's a safe.

776
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:36,574
If you shake it, there's a Piece inside.

777
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:38,910
So there is.

778
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:40,870
We have no idea if we'll be here tomorrow.

779
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:43,664
Everyone can try to secure
a Piece while they still can.

780
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,666
We tried "clock," but it didn't work.

781
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,252
We also thought of "snake,"
but there's no K-E.

782
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:50,171
Devil… D-E-V-I…

783
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,964
No. "Devil" doesn't work.

784
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:54,634
There's this picture of an eye.

785
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:55,843
Maybe you look inside and see something?

786
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,845
I tried, but I couldn't see anything.

787
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,180
Really?

788
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:02,642
That eye must mean something.

789
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:04,060
There must be something.

790
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:07,563
When I saw that eye, I had a gut feeling
that there was something there.

791
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:08,815
A massive hint.

792
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:11,025
Maybe if we fit those pieces together,
it falls out?

793
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:13,903
Wait, I can see a "T."

794
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:16,155
You can see a "T"?

795
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,573
What? You're right.

796
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:19,742
Where do you see it?

797
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:21,869
You need to look at it in the light.

798
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:24,163
-I can see it too!
-There we go.

799
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,832
So it's a die…

800
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:27,208
A cube.

801
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,838
There's an "I."

802
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:33,256
There's an "I"?

803
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:34,674
-This is an "I."
-Let's see.

804
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:35,591
Me too. "I."

805
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:36,717
I have an "I" too.

806
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:39,804
So, they all have the same die inside.

807
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:41,055
This is an "L."

808
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,348
L-I-E.

809
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:43,683
L-I-E-J.

810
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:45,184
There's a "U" as well.

811
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:48,187
L, I, E, J, T, U. That's all of them.

812
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:49,897
Now, we just need to unscramble it.

813
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,691
L, I, E, J…

814
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:52,942
It's Juliet.

815
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:54,026
Juliet.

816
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,779
-Isn't Juliet six letters?
-But this is five letters.

817
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:59,073
Juliet, five letters… Then, Romeo?

818
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:05,371
That works. "Romeo."

819
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:06,914
-I told you.
-"Romeo" is correct.

820
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,457
Right. It's "Romeo."

821
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:10,251
Got it.

822
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:11,335
It's Romeo and Juliet.

823
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:12,503
You're amazing.

824
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:16,716
Got to admire young brains
breaking a code like that in ten minutes.

825
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:18,050
The power of the hive mind.

826
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:21,137
We used it,
solved the problem, and found a note.

827
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,263
It's not a Piece?

828
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,849
When we looked inside the clock,
there was a wrench and…

829
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:27,393
There was some paper. On the paper…

830
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:28,352
Yeah, what is it?

831
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:30,771
"Make the birds sitting
in the trees fly away."

832
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,023
"Birds in the trees"?

833
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:34,150
I think they're all the same.
That's a relief.

834
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:36,068
Maybe there's a cuckoo clock somewhere?

835
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,820
Somewhere like that. Or over here.

836
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:40,323
"Make the birds sitting
in the trees fly away."

837
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:42,450
Trees.

838
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:46,037
Let's find the trees first. Trees.

839
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:49,415
In the trees…

840
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:51,292
Wait, there are some birds in trees.

841
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:56,505
Do we do something in here?

842
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:58,549
That tree. With birds.

843
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:01,219
-Here it is.
-See if there's a hole for a wrench.

844
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:02,136
Is this it?

845
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,387
It's a socket.

846
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:05,181
Birds on a tree.

847
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:07,391
Yes, there are birds sitting in the tree.

848
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,268
Let's undo it. Does it fit?

849
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:10,978
-It fits. It's a hex key.
-Yeah.

850
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,230
Amazing. Can you turn it?

851
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:15,608
Right, we might want to use these.
Hang on a sec. I'll clear them away.

852
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,070
-We're all so excited.
-It's interesting.

853
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,198
You're handy in so many ways.

854
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:23,324
It's come loose…

855
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,369
-What's inside?
-Take it out.

856
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:28,621
-Have the birds flown?
-No.

857
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:30,122
Wow, look.

858
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:32,583
-Pieces.
-This is for the Pieces.

859
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,418
-There are snakes.
-But I think it needs four.

860
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:35,962
I guess you have to put four in.

861
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:37,046
But it's deep.

862
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:38,297
I don't think you can get the Piece back.

863
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,049
I'm sure if the door opens,
you'll have to go and do a task.

864
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:43,678
You sound incredibly unenthusiastic.
Like at all.

865
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:46,180
I'm just done for the day.

866
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,890
Show us that famous laissez-faire.

867
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,350
-No? Since it's still Day 1?
-Not yet.

868
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,310
-Careful.
-I'm afraid it won't come back out.

869
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:53,312
It won't go in?

870
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:56,941
Well, I think if we put four in,
it'll click and then, we get them back.

871
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:58,276
I'm so curious.

872
00:37:58,359 --> 00:37:59,986
-Everyone's curious.
-I'm going nuts.

873
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:01,862
I'm willing to give up one of my Pieces.

874
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:02,780
-Me too.
-Yeah.

875
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:05,116
Let's keep this
to ourselves for now and if…

876
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:06,909
Are you going to hide the clocks?

877
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:08,661
We have to dispose of them.

878
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:09,662
Dispose?

879
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:12,123
Let's put some stones
or something in the clocks.

880
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:15,126
Oh? This is the rear face.
Front face, rear face.

881
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:18,004
The faces have different pictures.

882
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:19,463
So this one goes here.

883
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:21,799
-So the upshot is we can't get in.
-Why not?

884
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:23,884
We have to put the corresponding ones in.

885
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,553
Do any of the rear faces match up?

886
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:26,846
I don't think we do.

887
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:28,681
It was more than just the Pieces.

888
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:32,476
It was set up so that you have to match up
the patterns to the Pieces inserted.

889
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:36,814
But we only had one type of pattern,
so we couldn't open it.

890
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:38,441
-Is it this?
-No, I don't think so.

891
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:40,609
-I think we only have one.
-Right?

892
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:42,403
It's not easy.

893
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:45,489
We're the only ones
who know about it so far. There's no rush.

894
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:46,991
I just want to open it.

895
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:48,242
Me too. I'm so curious.

896
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,703
So-hui has a touch
of madness about her. Just like me.

897
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:51,954
Yes, I'm also a bit…

898
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:53,456
I want to open it somehow.

899
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:55,124
Your eyes look similar.

900
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:58,085
They're both clear
but with a touch of madness.

901
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:02,548
I want to be on the same team as So-hui.
I think we have a lot in common.

902
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:05,509
We have a similar look in our eyes.

903
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:07,595
The 30 minutes are almost up.

904
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:09,138
We'd better start getting ready.

905
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:17,313
Just a moment.

906
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:21,567
Let's get ready.

907
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:29,075
That bell…

908
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:31,577
The prison match will begin soon.

909
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:36,749
All players in the prison block,
please move to the death room.

910
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:41,462
You are strictly forbidden from taking
anything with you to the death room.

911
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:42,380
Forbidden.

912
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:44,382
-We're not allowed to take anything.
-My goodness.

913
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:45,299
We watch them?

914
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:48,135
How can I watch Se-dol play?

915
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,221
Don't get nervous, dummy!

916
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:52,223
Sorry.

917
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:55,393
This is the most serious game
of Remove One.

918
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,062
-Remove One.
-That's so funny.

919
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:11,367
Maybe we should relax a bit?

920
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:13,202
We always do rock, paper, scissors, so…

921
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:14,412
I'm scared.

922
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:17,164
-Gosh.
-We're playing standing up?

923
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,916
It's purple.

924
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:20,126
It's pretty.

925
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:21,669
Welcome.

926
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:26,382
This is the death room
where prison matches will be held.

927
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,929
It was a bit scary.
Like a dungeon of mirrors.

928
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:34,265
Because there were mirrors all around us,

929
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:37,059
it felt a bit like there was
a crowd watching us.

930
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:38,227
I'm curious.

931
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:43,149
Wow, that's amazing.

932
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:44,567
They even changed outfits.

933
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:45,734
Prison uniforms.

934
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:47,778
They're in prison uniforms.

935
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:48,696
Se-dol is…

936
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,531
He hasn't changed.

937
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:52,366
Don't you think he looks like a dealer?

938
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,910
-I thought he was.
-Like he's going to give them the rules.

939
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:57,329
On my first birthday,
I think I picked the thread.

940
00:40:57,413 --> 00:41:00,207
-I hope I survive…
-I feel like I'm dying young.

941
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:05,546
Now, the first prison match,
Remove One, will begin.

942
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:09,592
First, you will be given
a deck of number cards.

943
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:10,885
Oh, no.

944
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:12,761
The cards look like it'll be fun.

945
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:14,388
They're very pretty.

946
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:16,265
They're like tarot cards.

947
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:21,854
Wow, this is just…

948
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:23,898
-It's real-time.
-Straight to it.

949
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:26,150
I mean, it feels like
we're watching Netflix.

950
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:27,526
Wow. This is amazing.

951
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,778
Round 1 will now begin.

952
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:35,910
Select two cards and place them
face down in the boxes on the table.

953
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,205
My thinking was that

954
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:43,292
I shouldn't pick two cards that are
close in value at the beginning.

955
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:47,755
For example, 5-6 or 3-4.
I was trying to avoid consecutive numbers,

956
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:50,132
I decided to pick a second card
that was double the first.

957
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:53,969
I had the idea to play an expendable card
and a useful card together.

958
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:57,515
I decided to play one of 1, 2, 3, or 4
along with one of 5, 6, 7, or 8.

959
00:41:57,598 --> 00:42:01,310
And I thought a lot about which would be
the smartest combination.

960
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:13,822
Please reveal your two cards.

961
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:14,823
Okay.

962
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:28,754
Lots of 1s.

963
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:30,673
-Duplicates.
-One is a bust.

964
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:33,050
Can't they wink or signal each other?

965
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:37,096
Hold the marker of your final card
in a fist above the table.

966
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,898
Please reveal your marker.

967
00:43:02,037 --> 00:43:04,123
Lee Seung-hyun wins this round.

968
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:06,959
You are awarded with
one point and a victory token.

969
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:09,169
-That was Seung-hyun, right?
-I think so.

970
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:14,174
Eun-yu and I agreed
to help each other if we could.

971
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:16,635
When we first saw the rules
for the prison match,

972
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:20,389
she tapped me on the shoulder right away,
like three times, and I was like, "Huh?"

973
00:43:20,472 --> 00:43:23,142
I saw a note that said,
"Should we make an alliance?"

974
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:25,644
So when our numbers were the same,

975
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:27,521
we agreed to give each other signals.

976
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,398
If we're going with the left card,

977
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:31,859
we would tuck hair
behind our left ear and vice versa.

978
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:34,320
Seung-hyun and I both played 1,

979
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:37,448
so I just signaled she could have it.

980
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:40,159
I just played my 8,
and Seung-hyun took the 1.

981
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:42,411
Our alliance got off to a good start.

982
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:44,872
Round 2 will now begin.

983
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:48,208
Select two cards
and place them face down on the table.

984
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,805
-I forgot what my numbers were.
-I'm so nervous…

985
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:04,266
about this card game.

986
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:08,312
Please reveal the two cards
you have selected.

987
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:19,573
Only one 1.

988
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:22,034
-The one got it.
-As long as he plays it, he'll win.

989
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:23,994
Please reveal your marker.

990
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:27,706
Lee Se-dol wins this round.

991
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:30,292
You are awarded with
one point and a victory token.

992
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:31,627
But he lost his 1 now.

993
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,337
This is so nerve-racking.

994
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,673
Round 3 will now begin.

995
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:38,509
This is a survival round.

996
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:42,763
At the end of this round,
one player's survival will be guaranteed.

997
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:45,933
So, Rounds 1 and 2 are meaningless.

998
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:48,227
Whoever wins this round will be back.

999
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:51,188
So, you need to play
to win this round, no matter what.

1000
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:52,439
You got this, Se-dol!

1001
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:55,818
Select two cards
and place them on the table.

1002
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:03,200
Please reveal your cards.

1003
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:12,960
Hold the marker of your final card
in a fist above the table.

1004
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:14,503
-Are those 1s?
-A bunch of 1s.

1005
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:15,713
It's a battle of 1s.

1006
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:16,964
You can't play it now.

1007
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:18,173
Right.

1008
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:20,008
-It's a battle of wits.
-They have to read minds now!

1009
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:21,343
Then, 2 will win.

1010
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:30,561
Please reveal your marker.

1011
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:51,123
Choi Hyun-joon wins this round.

1012
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:53,625
You are awarded with
two points and a victory token.

1013
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:55,627
With the highest number of points,

1014
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:58,464
Choi Hyun-joon has guaranteed
his survival.

1015
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:01,800
Please return to the living space.

1016
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:03,177
Good job.

1017
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,470
Well played.

1018
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:08,932
What do I do now?

1019
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:10,976
You may now return to the prison block.

1020
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:12,603
-Back to prison?
-See you outside.

1021
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:14,855
Good job! Get some rest.

1022
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:15,814
Bye.

1023
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:19,276
-See you soon.
-Okay, well done.

1024
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:21,195
Sorry for leaving so soon.

1025
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:22,488
-Not at all.
-Get some rest.

1026
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:26,241
Wow, think how…

1027
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:30,370
-He must be shaken.
-He must be so stressed out.

1028
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,164
-Well played.
-Well done.

1029
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:33,582
Your legs just want to buckle.

1030
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:38,212
Just a moment.

1031
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:41,173
I got more stressed out than I thought.
I've got tears in my eyes.

1032
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:43,091
To be honest,

1033
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:46,970
I've never had my legs give out
after playing a card game.

1034
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:50,349
At first, I thought,

1035
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:54,937
"Should I deliberately stay until the end
and try to get another Piece?"

1036
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:58,565
But since I was in a situation
where I was fighting for my life,

1037
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,901
I realized it wasn't worth the risk.

1038
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:03,737
I decided to just play it safe
and save my life ASAP.

1039
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:16,959
All players' points have been reset.

1040
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:19,461
Round 4 will now begin.

1041
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:20,838
Se-dol.

1042
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:23,090
Select two cards
and place them on the table.

1043
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,802
The timing of a win is hugely important.

1044
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:29,596
You need to think about
what cards have already been played.

1045
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:43,819
CHUU, pull yourself together.

1046
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:45,279
Please reveal your cards.

1047
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:52,578
Hold the marker of your final card
in a fist above the table.

1048
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:55,122
Please reveal your marker.

1049
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:56,915
I missed that.

1050
00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:59,334
CHUU wins this round.

1051
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:01,712
You are awarded with
one point and a victory token.

1052
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:03,964
CHUU.

1053
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:05,632
But right now, 1 is…

1054
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:07,676
She does need to score quickly.

1055
00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:09,094
Take what you can get.

1056
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:11,430
Round 5 will now begin.

1057
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:20,439
Please reveal your cards.

1058
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:28,196
Please reveal your marker.

1059
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:32,743
Kim Ha-rin wins this round.

1060
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:35,329
You are awarded with
one point and a victory token.

1061
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:36,914
It's a repeat of earlier.

1062
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:38,373
The same fight at this rate.

1063
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:40,334
If you win the next round, you're done.

1064
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:42,419
Round 6 will now begin.

1065
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:45,255
This is a survival round.

1066
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:49,301
At the end of this round,
one player's survival will be guaranteed.

1067
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:50,677
They must be so nervous.

1068
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:53,347
Whoever has a 1 or 2 is safe, no?

1069
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:57,225
But based on the pattern so far,
I think everyone played their 1s.

1070
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:59,102
Place your two cards on the table.

1071
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:02,773
Hold the marker of your final card
in a fist above the table.

1072
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:04,399
Are there any 1s?

1073
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:11,657
Isn't this round pretty much over already?

1074
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,076
We get a new deck of cards.

1075
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:15,702
Please reveal your marker.

1076
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:20,374
Son Eun-yu wins this round.

1077
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:23,251
You are awarded with
two points and a victory token.

1078
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:25,170
-Eun-yu!
-Eun-yu made it.

1079
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:27,714
I knew she'd do great. Well played.

1080
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:30,175
Wow, Eun-yu is safe.

1081
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:34,680
I had my eye on Rounds 6 and 12
rather than Rounds 3 and 9.

1082
00:49:34,763 --> 00:49:38,475
My strategy was to discard
the big numbers in the beginning,

1083
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:41,436
so if I discarded all the big numbers
in Rounds 1, 2, and 3,

1084
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,272
I would have relatively smaller numbers
in Rounds 4, 5, and 6.

1085
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:47,609
I saved my 2 and played it in Round 6.

1086
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:49,486
With the highest number of points,

1087
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:52,614
Son Eun-yu has guaranteed her survival.

1088
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:54,950
Please return to the living space.

1089
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:56,785
-See you later.
-Good luck.

1090
00:49:56,868 --> 00:49:57,953
Congratulations.

1091
00:49:58,829 --> 00:49:59,955
See you all soon.

1092
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:01,373
Okay.

1093
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:04,710
-Yay!
-Well done.

1094
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:07,504
Really… Can you not see it from here?
You can.

1095
00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:09,548
Isn't it nerve-racking?

1096
00:50:09,631 --> 00:50:11,967
She saved that 2 until the end.

1097
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:15,303
Everyone's points will be reset.

1098
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:17,889
Round 7 will now begin.

1099
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:20,308
What am I going to do
if Se-dol ends up losing?

1100
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:21,727
That can't happen.

1101
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:25,480
But right now, Justin is in danger.
He doesn't have any victory tokens.

1102
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:27,190
You will be given a deck of number cards.

1103
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:28,692
Are we getting new cards?

1104
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:36,783
Select two cards
and place them face down on the table.

1105
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,371
Please reveal your cards.

1106
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:45,250
I'm not sure who's who.

1107
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:46,877
All we can see are their crowns.

1108
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,503
I can tell them apart by their heads.

1109
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:49,713
CHUU went with a 1.

1110
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:53,258
Please reveal your marker.

1111
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,304
CHUU wins this round.

1112
00:50:57,387 --> 00:50:59,347
You are awarded with
one point and a victory token.

1113
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:00,265
Okay.

1114
00:51:00,348 --> 00:51:01,558
CHUU is going to survive.

1115
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:03,101
You don't really see 7s.

1116
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:06,021
I don't think we ever will.
Maybe a 3 at best?

1117
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:08,732
Most people are inclined
to play almost the same cards

1118
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:10,525
in that kind of situation.

1119
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:14,029
They've all been playing
the same strategy.

1120
00:51:14,112 --> 00:51:16,531
Now, since they've figured out the game
to some degree…

1121
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:18,200
-Do something unexpected.
-Yes, they can now.

1122
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:19,451
The Poker player indeed!

1123
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:21,787
Round 8 will now begin.

1124
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:24,998
Select two cards
and place them on the table.

1125
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:26,666
Please reveal your selected cards.

1126
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:33,131
The 1 will win again.

1127
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:34,049
It looks like it.

1128
00:51:34,132 --> 00:51:35,717
Please reveal your marker.

1129
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:37,427
Kim Ha-rin wins this round.

1130
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:40,013
You are awarded with
one point and a victory token.

1131
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:44,184
That guy hasn't won anything. Not a bean.

1132
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:46,436
He's already two tokens behind
the leading players.

1133
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,647
Even if you tie, it's a win.

1134
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:50,941
It won't be easy for Justin to catch up.

1135
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:52,818
Round 9 will now begin.

1136
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:55,445
This is a survival round.

1137
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:59,407
At the end of this round,
one player's survival will be guaranteed.

1138
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:01,785
Select two cards
and place them on the table.

1139
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:06,081
I'm going to play my 1.

1140
00:52:09,876 --> 00:52:11,044
Acquiring one point,

1141
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:14,881
I'd have the same amount
of points and victory tokens.

1142
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:19,261
Then, I would win as the player
who won the most recent round.

1143
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:23,098
I think I did it as if to say
"I'm playing my 1, don't touch me."

1144
00:52:23,181 --> 00:52:25,016
Could someone else play their 1?

1145
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:27,269
CHUU and Ha-rin have used theirs.

1146
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:28,311
Justin hasn't.

1147
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:29,563
Justin still has his.

1148
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:34,151
One moment please.

1149
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:39,447
He's thinking about what to do.

1150
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:41,491
I think he should play it now. Please.

1151
00:52:45,203 --> 00:52:47,038
Please reveal your selected cards.

1152
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:03,722
One of them has to yield.

1153
00:53:03,805 --> 00:53:04,973
They coincided.

1154
00:53:05,056 --> 00:53:09,186
Hold the marker of your final card
in a fist above the table.

1155
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:10,687
I'm going with 1.

1156
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:18,486
Please reveal your marker.

1157
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:41,009
I thought I would make it
to the final three.

1158
00:53:41,092 --> 00:53:44,095
I wasn't sure
if there would be a Piece or not,

1159
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:46,598
but when it was confirmed,
my greed got the better of me.

1160
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:48,225
Lee Seung-hyun wins this round.

1161
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:50,852
You are awarded with
one point and a victory token.

1162
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:53,480
Having won the most recent round,

1163
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:56,858
Lee Seung-hyun has guaranteed
her survival.

1164
00:53:57,817 --> 00:54:00,111
Please return to the living space.

1165
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:02,739
-See you on the outside.
-See you later.

1166
00:54:02,822 --> 00:54:03,907
I'll see you later.

1167
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:05,325
Don't give up.

1168
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:08,745
She made it. Nice.

1169
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:14,793
Good job.

1170
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:17,254
-But I feel uneasy.
-I know the feeling.

1171
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:19,422
Like I stepped over others to get here.

1172
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:20,966
I don't feel good about that.

1173
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:24,219
Everyone's points will be reset.

1174
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:29,224
Lee Se-dol wins this round.

1175
00:54:29,307 --> 00:54:30,475
CHUU wins this round.

1176
00:54:30,558 --> 00:54:32,018
Kim Ha-rin wins this round.

1177
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:37,899
Justin must be feeling frustrated.
He still hasn't won even once.

1178
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:40,235
Round 10 will now begin.

1179
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:41,528
Is it Round 10 already?

1180
00:54:42,153 --> 00:54:43,697
It's getting intense.

1181
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:46,908
I'm getting chills.
We're already down to four people.

1182
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:49,869
Select two cards
and place them on the table.

1183
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:57,711
Reveal your cards.

1184
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:03,216
There's a 1. Justin got it.

1185
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,010
Justin Min wins this round.

1186
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:07,554
You are awarded with
one point and a victory token.

1187
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:11,433
Well played.

1188
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:15,520
To be honest, I wanted to get that Piece.

1189
00:55:15,603 --> 00:55:18,398
That's a huge advantage.

1190
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:23,778
In the first few rounds, I thought
I'd look for patterns in other people.

1191
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:27,407
Then, try to win in the last round.

1192
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:29,993
Round 11 will now begin.

1193
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,457
Please reveal your cards.

1194
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:41,671
Yes. 1. Here we go.

1195
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:43,131
Please reveal your marker.

1196
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:45,342
Lee Se-dol wins this round.

1197
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:48,094
You are awarded with
one point and a victory token.

1198
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:50,555
Round 12 will now begin.

1199
00:55:50,638 --> 00:55:53,433
This is a survival round.

1200
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:57,437
At the end of this round,
one player's survival will be guaranteed.

1201
00:55:58,938 --> 00:55:59,856
Oh, no.

1202
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:01,608
Justin is nervous. Everyone is.

1203
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:04,694
Select two cards
and place them on the table.

1204
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:09,616
Why did she put them face up? Ha-rin?

1205
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:11,493
Justin hasn't played his yet.

1206
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:13,203
Oh, dear.

1207
00:56:13,286 --> 00:56:14,245
Why are they face up?

1208
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:15,205
She's flustered.

1209
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:16,289
Ha-rin.

1210
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:17,874
Please put them face down.

1211
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:18,792
Oh, right.

1212
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:21,336
-I didn't see.
-Place them on the table.

1213
00:56:25,006 --> 00:56:26,591
Please reveal your cards.

1214
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:30,929
-What do I do now?
-What is this?

1215
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:33,014
I want to play that 2, but what do I do?

1216
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:34,641
Is that a 5 and a 6?

1217
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:36,643
They both played 2s. Two 2s.

1218
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:39,104
Wow, so is 3 going to win?

1219
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:40,772
I want to play my 2…

1220
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:43,066
It's between CHUU and me.

1221
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:45,610
What do I do? I want to play my 2.

1222
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:49,656
I want to play my 2.

1223
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:52,492
-If you play your 2…
-Yes?

1224
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:53,993
She will win.

1225
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:57,288
Then she will be free
because it's the last round.

1226
00:56:57,372 --> 00:56:58,373
You're right.

1227
00:56:58,456 --> 00:57:02,293
So unless one of us yields,
we'll both die.

1228
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:03,878
What should we do?

1229
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:07,674
In the end, it's a choice
between the three of us.

1230
00:57:09,467 --> 00:57:13,138
If I play my 6,

1231
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:15,974
she'll definitely play that
and we will lose.

1232
00:57:16,057 --> 00:57:17,892
This is insane.

1233
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:20,103
-Then, what?
-What should we do?

1234
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:26,901
So, this is how it ends.
Turning on each other.

1235
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:30,363
-This is hard.
-How can you yield?

1236
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:31,823
To be honest, you can't.

1237
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:33,450
Play it.

1238
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:37,412
I do feel bad for Ha-rin.

1239
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:41,541
To be honest, picking Ha-rin is
the right thing to do.

1240
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:42,542
I pick Ji-yeong.

1241
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,503
I'm also slightly sorry to Ha-rin…

1242
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:47,422
Though I am a fan of CHUU,

1243
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:50,925
seeing my teammate go through

1244
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:52,385
would make me feel better.

1245
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:53,678
I've made my decision.

1246
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:54,804
You're going with 2?

1247
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:56,639
That, I can't tell you.

1248
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:05,315
Seeing you puts the pressure on me.

1249
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:07,525
-You're going to play your 2, right?
-Yes.

1250
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:09,569
-Will you?
-I don't think I have a choice.

1251
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:12,697
But what choice do I have right now?

1252
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:15,116
Since it's the last round,
I want to play mine too.

1253
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,367
I just don't know.

1254
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:18,495
If CHUU is saying that…

1255
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:20,872
I think she will.
What happens if they both play it?

1256
00:58:20,955 --> 00:58:23,249
Earlier, that was a save,
but this will be a yield.

1257
00:58:32,383 --> 00:58:33,676
Please reveal your marker.

1258
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:40,099
Wow, CHUU.

1259
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:41,893
CHUU let him go.

1260
00:58:41,976 --> 00:58:43,478
You're right.

1261
00:58:43,561 --> 00:58:45,188
-She didn't play her 2.
-CHUU played her 4.

1262
00:58:45,271 --> 00:58:46,856
Then, Se-dol won.

1263
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:48,358
I won.

1264
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:50,693
You are awarded with
two points and a victory token.

1265
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:54,113
I assumed you'd leave
and we would discuss how to proceed.

1266
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:56,199
I very much appreciate the thought.

1267
00:58:56,282 --> 00:58:58,743
-I'm sorry.
-I should have stayed.

1268
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:01,913
I thought Se-dol wanted to get out,
so I was like,

1269
00:59:01,996 --> 00:59:03,456
"He's going to play his 2."

1270
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:06,668
If I played mine, it would be moot
and Ha-rin would win.

1271
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:09,003
There was no benefit for me,

1272
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:11,172
so that's why I played my 4.

1273
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:12,840
I never imagined this would happen.

1274
00:59:12,924 --> 00:59:14,884
I was sure she'd play her 2.

1275
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:17,971
Lee Se-dol has guaranteed his survival.

1276
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:19,973
-Please return to the living space.
-Don't come back empty-handed.

1277
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:21,266
Make sure you all win something.

1278
00:59:21,349 --> 00:59:23,726
-We'll try and have some fun.
-Hang in there.

1279
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:26,062
Oh… What now?

1280
00:59:26,145 --> 00:59:28,523
I was really upset to see
the two of them battling,

1281
00:59:28,606 --> 00:59:29,691
but now it's…

1282
00:59:29,774 --> 00:59:31,317
Now it's down to the final three.

1283
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:33,194
-I can't bear to watch.
-It's so cruel.

1284
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:36,614
So, one of these three will get
a Piece and one of them will be gone.

1285
00:59:37,865 --> 00:59:38,992
-You okay?
-I screwed up.

1286
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:41,327
Not at all. We watched it all.

1287
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:42,787
It's not that I feel upset.

1288
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:44,622
I wanted to be in the final three.

1289
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:46,541
I wanted to be there in the final three.

1290
00:59:46,624 --> 00:59:48,001
-Were you after the Piece?
-I mean…

1291
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:50,920
It would have been nice
to get a Piece and I was having fun.

1292
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:53,840
Everyone's points will be reset.

1293
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:56,551
Round 13 will now begin.

1294
00:59:56,634 --> 00:59:59,387
The rules for the last six rounds
are a little different.

1295
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:01,848
There is no survival round in Round 15.

1296
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:04,976
Instead, there will be
two survivors in Round 18,

1297
01:00:05,059 --> 01:00:09,689
so they must use
all eight number cards wisely.

1298
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:12,650
Whoever gets the most points here
gets a Piece.

1299
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:15,820
I'm not even thinking about the Piece.
I'm just too scared.

1300
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:22,744
Wow, I can't watch these three.
Honestly, I'm too nervous.

1301
01:00:22,827 --> 01:00:24,621
You will be given a deck of number cards.

1302
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:28,791
Me too.

1303
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:33,755
Select two cards
and place them face down on the table.

1304
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:41,179
Please reveal your cards.

1305
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:52,148
Ha-rin made a strategic bet
and played her 1 first thing.

1306
01:00:52,231 --> 01:00:54,400
Since most people don't play 1 right away.

1307
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:58,029
Hold the marker of your final card
in a fist above the table.

1308
01:00:59,113 --> 01:01:00,657
Please reveal your marker.

1309
01:01:02,742 --> 01:01:04,077
Kim Ha-rin wins this round.

1310
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,287
You are awarded with
one point and a victory token.

1311
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:08,247
But you can't win at the end like that.

1312
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:10,041
But there might be two 1s.

1313
01:01:10,124 --> 01:01:12,919
So, those two should negotiate.

1314
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:14,837
Those three can't negotiate.

1315
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:16,381
Their lives are on the line.

1316
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:17,715
Negotiation is impossible.

1317
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:20,593
Round 14 will now begin.

1318
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:24,222
Select two cards
and place them face down on the table.

1319
01:01:29,894 --> 01:01:31,270
Please reveal your cards.

1320
01:01:36,317 --> 01:01:37,652
CHUU used hers. Wait a sec.

1321
01:01:37,735 --> 01:01:39,946
Yeah, she has to use her 1.

1322
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:42,365
-Justin hasn't used his 1, has he?
-No.

1323
01:01:42,448 --> 01:01:43,908
Please reveal your marker.

1324
01:01:45,284 --> 01:01:46,786
CHUU wins this round.

1325
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:49,414
You are awarded with
one point and a victory token.

1326
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:51,958
How are they supposed to play
the last six rounds?

1327
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:54,085
There won't be a survivor
after three rounds.

1328
01:01:54,168 --> 01:01:56,254
They just keep playing
straight to Round 18.

1329
01:01:56,921 --> 01:01:59,465
Round 15 will now begin.

1330
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:02,468
Select two cards
and place them on the table.

1331
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:11,394
Everyone looks so serious.

1332
01:02:12,478 --> 01:02:13,646
Please reveal your cards.

1333
01:02:20,778 --> 01:02:22,864
-Wow, two 2s…
-Oh, dear.

1334
01:02:22,947 --> 01:02:24,949
CHUU's played 8 and 2.

1335
01:02:25,032 --> 01:02:27,201
Wow, he might play his seven.

1336
01:02:27,285 --> 01:02:28,327
CHUU played her eight.

1337
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:30,079
She might want to just toss the eight.

1338
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:31,706
-There are six rounds.
-True.

1339
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:37,086
I…

1340
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,297
want to play my 2.

1341
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:42,425
I only have one token.

1342
01:02:42,508 --> 01:02:45,595
Really? But if I die here…

1343
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:47,388
what am I supposed to do?

1344
01:02:47,889 --> 01:02:48,973
I'm going to do it.

1345
01:02:49,056 --> 01:02:50,183
Me too.

1346
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:51,893
It's fine.

1347
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:58,274
She decided that if she can't win
with a 2, it's meaningless.

1348
01:02:58,357 --> 01:02:59,400
But then, Ha-rin…

1349
01:02:59,484 --> 01:03:01,736
If Ha-rin wins with a 3,
that's three points.

1350
01:03:01,819 --> 01:03:02,653
Exactly.

1351
01:03:02,737 --> 01:03:03,821
Wow, this really is…

1352
01:03:03,905 --> 01:03:05,865
The other two will be in bigger trouble.

1353
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:08,075
But how can you give up now?

1354
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:11,704
Hold the marker of your final card
in a fist above the table.

1355
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:13,080
Give me a second.

1356
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:28,387
Play your 2. Play it.

1357
01:03:32,016 --> 01:03:33,226
Just a moment.

1358
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:34,977
Can I have a quick look?

1359
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:36,020
Yes, you can.

1360
01:04:00,336 --> 01:04:01,838
Are you going to play your 2?

1361
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:04,423
I don't know.

1362
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:06,425
I think they should both toss their 8s.

1363
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:09,387
-Justin has nowhere to retreat to.
-He won't play his 7.

1364
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:32,285
Please reveal your marker.

1365
01:04:38,332 --> 01:04:40,209
Oh, no! I thought so long and hard…

1366
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:43,838
Please move the card
you didn't select to the holding box.

1367
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:46,591
I'm about to lose it.

1368
01:04:57,602 --> 01:05:01,147
But we both played our 2.

1369
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:03,107
Wow, how did that happen?

1370
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:05,902
I never thought they'd both play their 2.

1371
01:05:05,985 --> 01:05:06,903
What a face-off.

1372
01:05:06,986 --> 01:05:08,529
Kim Ha-rin wins this round.

1373
01:05:08,613 --> 01:05:11,198
You are awarded with
three points and a victory token.

1374
01:05:12,366 --> 01:05:15,286
This is now a game
between CHUU and Justin.

1375
01:05:15,369 --> 01:05:17,496
Then, I guess the Piece will go to Ha-rin.

1376
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:19,248
Exactly, the Piece is Ha-rin's.

1377
01:05:19,332 --> 01:05:20,958
That's a resounding victory.

1378
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:22,543
I said I would give her a free pass.

1379
01:05:22,627 --> 01:05:25,129
Darn, now she's gone on to get a Piece.

1380
01:05:25,212 --> 01:05:27,882
So, that's what you were trying to do.

1381
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:31,719
-That's so funny.
-Se-dol, why are you the comic relief?

1382
01:05:31,802 --> 01:05:33,095
He reveals his true self.

1383
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:36,140
Round 16 will now begin.

1384
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:44,899
Select two cards
and place them on the table.

1385
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:49,111
Please reveal your cards.

1386
01:05:52,531 --> 01:05:54,617
-The 1 is going to win.
-He has to play it.

1387
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:57,578
He's gone for it because he's desperate.
It's not a good move.

1388
01:05:57,662 --> 01:06:01,040
Hold the marker of your final card
in a fist above the table.

1389
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:04,752
Please reveal your marker.

1390
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:09,090
Justin Min wins this round.

1391
01:06:09,173 --> 01:06:11,676
You are awarded with
one point and a victory token.

1392
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:14,971
Round 17 will now begin.

1393
01:06:15,054 --> 01:06:17,223
Select two cards
and place them on the table.

1394
01:06:35,533 --> 01:06:37,243
Please reveal your cards.

1395
01:06:49,463 --> 01:06:50,464
Is that 4 and 8?

1396
01:06:50,548 --> 01:06:52,258
-Justin wins.
-With a 3.

1397
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:53,217
What?

1398
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:55,302
That means Justin has four points.

1399
01:06:55,386 --> 01:06:56,971
Justin's really going for it.

1400
01:06:57,054 --> 01:06:58,639
Please reveal your marker.

1401
01:07:00,641 --> 01:07:02,727
Justin Min wins this round.

1402
01:07:02,810 --> 01:07:05,354
You are awarded with
three points and a victory token.

1403
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:12,611
I saw a 2 and a 3.

1404
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,994
I saw it as a "big chance."

1405
01:07:20,077 --> 01:07:22,788
The card that CHUU picks
is going to be so important.

1406
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:24,790
CHUU has a 4 in the box.

1407
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:26,292
The cards in her hand must be quite big.

1408
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:27,209
This is scary.

1409
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:38,512
Round 18 will now begin.

1410
01:07:38,596 --> 01:07:41,724
This is the last survival round.

1411
01:07:41,807 --> 01:07:45,811
At the end of this round,
two players will guarantee their survival.

1412
01:07:57,281 --> 01:07:58,699
Please reveal your cards.

1413
01:08:31,315 --> 01:08:32,441
-Is it CHUU?
-Oh, no.

1414
01:08:33,275 --> 01:08:34,777
If Ha-rin doesn't play 2?

1415
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:36,278
What if she plays her 5?

1416
01:08:37,029 --> 01:08:39,824
That's so true.
Because that makes it entirely her choice.

1417
01:08:39,907 --> 01:08:43,202
If she plays her 5,
she'd be sending her through.

1418
01:08:43,285 --> 01:08:45,162
She's choosing which team to go with.

1419
01:08:45,246 --> 01:08:47,331
It's honestly up to her.

1420
01:08:47,414 --> 01:08:49,125
But with a Piece on the line,

1421
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:50,709
anyone would go with the 2.

1422
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:52,419
Well, Ha-rin and CHUU…

1423
01:08:52,503 --> 01:08:54,964
They barely had any interaction.
It's only the first day.

1424
01:08:59,468 --> 01:09:00,761
Please reveal your marker.

1425
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:10,855
Kim Ha-rin wins this round.

1426
01:09:10,938 --> 01:09:13,315
You are awarded with
two points and a victory token.

1427
01:09:13,858 --> 01:09:15,401
Well played, everybody.

1428
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:16,569
Well played.

1429
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:18,654
That marks the end of the game.

1430
01:09:18,737 --> 01:09:21,615
Of the three of you,
with most accumulated points,

1431
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:25,077
Kim Ha-rin is awarded one Piece.

1432
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:27,121
I feel so bad.

1433
01:09:27,746 --> 01:09:29,373
Well played.

1434
01:09:29,456 --> 01:09:30,875
It's over.

1435
01:09:32,459 --> 01:09:33,586
Oh, dear.

1436
01:09:36,881 --> 01:09:38,841
Does that mean Lord CHUU is eliminated?

1437
01:09:38,924 --> 01:09:40,134
Damn.

1438
01:09:41,302 --> 01:09:43,262
Poor thing. Can we go down to see her?

1439
01:09:43,345 --> 01:09:44,180
No.

1440
01:09:44,263 --> 01:09:46,765
-I feel so close to everyone already.
-Truly.

1441
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:48,976
Is it because
we strategized together earlier?

1442
01:09:49,059 --> 01:09:49,935
Exactly.

1443
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:56,066
With that, CHUU becomes the first person
eliminated from The Devil's Plan.

1444
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:56,984
Yes.

1445
01:09:57,067 --> 01:10:00,070
CHUU, please leave this place immediately.

1446
01:10:00,154 --> 01:10:01,405
-Okay, thank you.
-I feel so bad.

1447
01:10:01,488 --> 01:10:02,740
I'll be cheering for you.

1448
01:10:03,324 --> 01:10:04,992
-I'll watch the show.
-Okay.

1449
01:10:05,075 --> 01:10:07,286
Good luck, Justin.

1450
01:10:07,369 --> 01:10:09,079
-Go as far as you can!
-Good job.

1451
01:10:09,163 --> 01:10:10,247
We'll go for it.

1452
01:10:10,331 --> 01:10:11,874
Bye. See you on the outside.

1453
01:10:11,957 --> 01:10:13,417
I'm disappointed.

1454
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:15,169
I wanted to do a lot more,

1455
01:10:15,252 --> 01:10:18,672
and I wanted to achieve
a bit more than this.

1456
01:10:18,756 --> 01:10:20,257
I'm really disappointed.

1457
01:10:20,841 --> 01:10:26,263
I was excited to just be here
but also a little scared.

1458
01:10:26,347 --> 01:10:28,599
But while playing the game today,

1459
01:10:28,682 --> 01:10:30,935
although it was hard, I had a lot of fun.

1460
01:10:31,018 --> 01:10:34,313
I think I overcame
my fear of trying new things.

1461
01:10:34,813 --> 01:10:40,027
The Devil's Plan was a way
for a scaredy-cat like me

1462
01:10:40,110 --> 01:10:42,404
to overcome my fears.

1463
01:10:43,364 --> 01:10:47,952
I think that was…
what this experience meant to me.

1464
01:10:56,001 --> 01:10:57,294
Well played.

1465
01:10:58,879 --> 01:11:00,756
So, this is how it turned out.

1466
01:11:00,839 --> 01:11:02,549
But I feel so sad right now.

1467
01:11:03,175 --> 01:11:05,386
That concludes the prison match.

1468
01:11:05,469 --> 01:11:08,389
All remaining players,
please return to the living space.

1469
01:11:08,472 --> 01:11:09,765
We go back like this.

1470
01:11:09,848 --> 01:11:12,017
-We've been through so much today.
-We're going back.

1471
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:13,435
Back to prison.

1472
01:11:14,979 --> 01:11:18,315
I spent the whole day
being suspicious of you, Justin.

1473
01:11:18,399 --> 01:11:21,694
-I got a Piece.
-A Piece!

1474
01:11:21,777 --> 01:11:23,737
That was a lot. Well done.

1475
01:11:23,821 --> 01:11:26,532
-Super good job.
-Now, let's get some rest. What a day.

1476
01:11:26,615 --> 01:11:28,450
Why do I suddenly feel so drained?

1477
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:30,619
Does the other Piece look any different?

1478
01:11:30,703 --> 01:11:32,246
Right, can we see your Piece?

1479
01:11:32,329 --> 01:11:33,664
Right, you've got one more now.

1480
01:11:33,747 --> 01:11:35,207
It might look different.

1481
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:36,208
Let's see.

1482
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:37,251
Let's compare.

1483
01:11:37,334 --> 01:11:38,168
Ta-da!

1484
01:11:38,252 --> 01:11:39,420
Oh? The same…

1485
01:11:39,503 --> 01:11:40,754
-It's the same.
-Too same.

1486
01:11:40,838 --> 01:11:42,214
-Is it?
-It's exactly the same.

1487
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:43,257
-What?
-They're all the same?

1488
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:45,259
Then, does that mean this is meaningless?

1489
01:11:45,342 --> 01:11:49,388
I think we might need a lot.
We might need nine Pieces or so.

1490
01:11:49,471 --> 01:11:51,140
That would be too hard.

1491
01:11:51,223 --> 01:11:55,561
No, they've already got four each.
It might not take that long to get nine.

1492
01:11:55,644 --> 01:11:58,439
You might be able to slot them together.

1493
01:11:58,522 --> 01:12:01,358
Is it a puzzle this time?
A 2D puzzle? Like this?

1494
01:12:01,442 --> 01:12:03,444
-Like this? It might be.
-Jigsaw pieces.

1495
01:12:03,527 --> 01:12:04,653
But they're the same.

1496
01:12:04,737 --> 01:12:06,655
Exactly, so you can't do it with these.

1497
01:12:06,739 --> 01:12:11,243
-So in conclusion, we don't know yet.
-Not yet.

1498
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:13,287
It doesn't go together at all.
Not right now.

1499
01:12:15,539 --> 01:12:16,999
Are you finally changing?

1500
01:12:17,082 --> 01:12:18,083
It looks really big.

1501
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:20,502
-Se-dol, finally.
-Prison fashion.

1502
01:12:22,087 --> 01:12:24,089
One person…

1503
01:12:24,757 --> 01:12:28,427
What's worse is that
tomorrow, that might be me.

1504
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:29,678
Could be anyone.

1505
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:31,680
So I'm feeling empathetic.

1506
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:33,474
That could have been me.

1507
01:12:34,058 --> 01:12:35,559
Gotta live each day like it's your last.

1508
01:12:36,852 --> 01:12:38,979
Wow. Denim on denim.

1509
01:12:39,063 --> 01:12:42,107
Okay, that looks much better.
You should dress like that.

1510
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:43,442
It suits you.

1511
01:12:43,525 --> 01:12:44,693
I like it.

1512
01:12:44,777 --> 01:12:46,236
Not just the prison

1513
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:50,074
but the place where we played the game,
it was all much better than expected.

1514
01:12:50,157 --> 01:12:53,035
But is there really
nothing hidden in the prison?

1515
01:12:53,118 --> 01:12:55,037
I'm actually quite disappointed
about that.

1516
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:58,248
Well, there could be
something hidden in here.

1517
01:12:58,332 --> 01:13:00,709
-Right?
-Is there really nothing in here?

1518
01:13:00,793 --> 01:13:03,796
Shall we take all these out?
See if there's anything underneath?

1519
01:13:04,797 --> 01:13:06,131
Really? You're serious?

1520
01:13:11,678 --> 01:13:14,014
They must have hidden something.

1521
01:13:14,098 --> 01:13:16,100
Maybe it's hidden in plain sight?

1522
01:13:20,938 --> 01:13:23,816
Is there really nothing hidden?

1523
01:13:23,899 --> 01:13:26,318
Because we finished
the death match already,

1524
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:27,569
so what do we do now?

1525
01:13:27,653 --> 01:13:28,737
There should be something.

1526
01:13:28,821 --> 01:13:31,031
-We are definitely meant to.
-We were making walls earlier.

1527
01:13:33,492 --> 01:13:35,327
These are loose. Honestly, it moves.

1528
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:36,745
I told you it moves.

1529
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:39,540
Shall I pry it up with a pen?
It really does move.

1530
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,836
-Come here.
-Are we just breaking things?

1531
01:13:43,919 --> 01:13:46,588
Don't use too much strength.

1532
01:13:47,631 --> 01:13:49,007
Oh? Come here!

1533
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:50,300
What?

1534
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:52,219
What is it?

1535
01:13:52,302 --> 01:13:53,720
-Come here.
-What?

1536
01:13:54,721 --> 01:13:56,098
What is it?

1537
01:13:56,181 --> 01:13:57,599
What is it?

1538
01:13:57,683 --> 01:13:58,559
What?

1539
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:49,211
7high.

1540
01:15:51,964 --> 01:15:54,091
7high.

1541
01:15:55,842 --> 01:15:57,427
I think he went to the bathroom.

1542
01:15:58,887 --> 01:16:03,225
I wrote that 7high was corrupt.

1543
01:16:03,725 --> 01:16:04,893
I'm sorry.

1544
01:16:09,982 --> 01:16:10,899
What did you say?

1545
01:16:13,735 --> 01:16:14,945
They're a team already.

1546
01:16:15,028 --> 01:16:16,863
7high just…

1547
01:16:24,997 --> 01:16:26,415
They don't matter to us.

1548
01:16:33,380 --> 01:16:34,798
Because he's corrupt.

1549
01:16:39,177 --> 01:16:42,264
I need to discuss it with the other teams.

1550
01:16:44,308 --> 01:16:45,475
So you guys don't have corruption?

1551
01:16:49,062 --> 01:16:50,188
Right now, I…

1552
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:51,398
Yes?

1553
01:16:51,481 --> 01:16:55,611
Like… If 7high is corrupt, what do we do?

1554
01:16:57,362 --> 01:16:59,406
Why? Do you think he's corrupt?

1555
01:17:04,244 --> 01:17:07,706
Having talked with him,
I don't think he's corrupt.

1556
01:17:07,789 --> 01:17:09,583
And if he's been lying,

1557
01:17:09,666 --> 01:17:12,419
he should have been an actor.

1558
01:17:13,128 --> 01:17:14,671
7high, seriously…

1559
01:17:16,298 --> 01:17:17,799
I'm so embarrassed.
