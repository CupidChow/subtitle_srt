1
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,764
Change to green and toss Sang-yeon out.

2
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:19,227
-Okay, I will change to green.
-Like this.

3
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:20,854
Wait, then, I'll be pushed out.

4
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:22,814
-Is this correct?
-Yes.

5
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:27,402
Hang on.

6
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:31,781
-Please select a green player and…
-Can we talk for a second?

7
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,700
-Put him to 126 and kill him.
-What's there to say?

8
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:36,369
-You were in a frenzy.
-You just killed me earlier.

9
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:38,038
No, we need to kill him via 126.

10
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,706
-Give me a reason.
-Se-dol.

11
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:41,541
Tell me a reason why I must.

12
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:44,002
-He killed me right before I finished.
-I'll give you a Piece.

13
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:46,254
Hey, why would I do that
just for a Piece, you dope?

14
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:48,631
-He killed me right before I got in.
-You're a funny kid.

15
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,633
He should have given me a proper reason.

16
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,720
He killed me at the finish line.

17
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:55,138
Please kill him quickly.

18
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,973
-So, I can move someone, right?
-Yes.

19
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,434
-To 126.
-Please kill him.

20
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:01,853
You could have just pushed her back.

21
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:03,646
I was fine
as long as I could get one Piece.

22
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,859
Moving Park Sang-yeon's counter
to square 126.

23
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:10,528
Park Sang-yeon, you have been exiled.

24
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:12,947
You will be given one exile token.

25
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:16,868
Things are really kicking off.

26
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:24,250
Please place your counter
on a new starting square.

27
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:28,213
So, this is why this game takes so long.

28
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:30,173
Who knew it would last this long?

29
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,966
I've placed my counter.

30
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,302
-Is that the right direction?
-It's my only choice.

31
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:36,012
I'm sorry, Sang-yeon.

32
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:39,641
I failed to calculate Se-dol's green
showing up combined with your green.

33
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:40,809
-If only I'd realized…
-It's okay.

34
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:42,602
Yoon So-hui is next.

35
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:44,687
How about trying
to push Ji-yeong for the win?

36
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:49,359
If I go purple, I can move her.

37
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,736
So-hui can move me.

38
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,239
It won't end like this anyway.

39
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:55,824
If it ends here…

40
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,993
There is nothing to say.
It's just five on five.

41
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,579
Wait. Jeez.

42
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:02,705
Mr. Dealer.

43
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:07,961
If I end up landing on this
with white facing up…

44
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:08,920
I just asked that.

45
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:10,130
Psychological warfare?

46
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:14,300
If that happens, will I be exiled?

47
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,177
Which square are you talking about?

48
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:19,889
Let's say I land here on the goal,
with white facing up.

49
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,559
Will I be exiled for that?

50
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:27,147
The game will end immediately
upon your landing.

51
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:31,151
Earlier you wouldn't answer me, but now…

52
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:34,195
When you asked,
it was before the exile rule was revealed.

53
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,865
FIRST HIDDEN RULE

54
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:39,367
Was it before the first hidden rule
was revealed?

55
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,661
-Correct.
-It was too soon.

56
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,121
Amazing.

57
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:44,455
Let's go! Let's go for it!

58
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:45,957
In that case,

59
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,459
I will go to 89.

60
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:50,753
This is like twist after twist.

61
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,173
Moving to square 89.

62
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:58,511
Yoon So-hui, please select a purple player
and move them one square.

63
00:02:58,595 --> 00:02:59,888
Square 131.

64
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,639
I will send her to 131.

65
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,350
Moving to square 131.

66
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:10,690
Kang Ji-yeong, please select a blue player
and move their counter one space.

67
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:11,608
Blue?

68
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,067
7high is the only player.

69
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,195
But going backward would be bad for him.

70
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,946
Isn't it over next turn?

71
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,406
-You'll be top five.
-Okay?

72
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:19,449
Go back.

73
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,285
Then, I will move 7high to 111.

74
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,120
-Moving to square 111.
-Yes.

75
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,791
7high, please change your color.

76
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,503
Just change it to blue and put her in.

77
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:36,341
Right. The game is over if I do that.
Hold on.

78
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:39,636
I can finish it, but I just need to see
if that's the best option.

79
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,180
Ji-yeong wins.

80
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:44,599
Then, who will be second?
Who has the highest number?

81
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:48,686
If she finishes, it would end like this.

82
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,189
These players will get the points.
This cluster here.

83
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:54,484
-I exiled so many people.
-Let's end it.

84
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:58,029
If I go to prison,
they might finish me off immediately.

85
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:02,116
If 7high changes to blue

86
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,494
and helps Ji-yeong win,

87
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,412
based on their current positions,

88
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:09,290
these five players
will be rewarded Pieces

89
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:12,043
and Park Sang-yeon
will be heading to prison

90
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:14,128
due to his bottom ranking
for having one Piece.

91
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,880
That's why I stopped.

92
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,090
Let's just look at this.

93
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:20,343
Can someone from the other team
move a blue player next turn?

94
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:21,469
We should check that.

95
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:24,055
Check for all the possible color changes.

96
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:25,807
-Nothing.
-Nothing blue. Move up.

97
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,767
-Nothing here.
-Nothing here, either.

98
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,945
If Justin Min, whose turn is coming soon,

99
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:41,406
moves his counter towards 7high,

100
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:44,492
it will turn red
and he will be able to change his color.

101
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:46,703
If he changes to blue,

102
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,330
he can exile Kang Ji-yeong.

103
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:52,583
Our turns…

104
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,298
-I know.
-I'm only asking out of curiosity.

105
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,924
Why aren't you ending it?

106
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:03,553
We're just trying to do
what we can to save this guy.

107
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,680
-Yes, we were contemplating.
-But it's not elimination.

108
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:09,600
If I end up in prison now,
I might get what I paid for.

109
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,144
-What are you saying?
-My enemies--

110
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:12,353
Then, am I already dead?

111
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:14,272
Come on now.

112
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:16,983
You built up your reputation
before you went there.

113
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:19,444
The game in prison…

114
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:21,904
It's a solo game.

115
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:25,408
Well, if you send Sang-yeon to prison,
we will off him in the death match.

116
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,328
How can we send him there
when you say it like that?

117
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,829
The cell block leader is here.

118
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:33,708
Then, let's do this.

119
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:37,170
Just push Ji-yeong in and have her win.

120
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:39,714
I'll do my best to survive tonight,

121
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:41,466
so give me a Piece tomorrow.

122
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:43,926
Of course, I'll give you a Piece.

123
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,012
We should have protected the kid.

124
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,431
I don't think we have any choice.

125
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:52,810
From there… Darn.

126
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:54,896
Please change me to blue.

127
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,815
-Is this correct?
-Yes.

128
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:04,489
7high, please select a blue player
and move their counter one square.

129
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,616
I'll move Kang Ji-yeong up.

130
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:12,038
Moving Kang Ji-yeong to the goal square.

131
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,957
-Congratulations.
-Well played.

132
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,043
-I'll give you a Piece later.
-Good job.

133
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:20,129
Kang Ji-yeong has crossed the finish line.

134
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,507
Unknown has now ended.

135
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,884
That was tough.

136
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:30,014
I feel like I'm holding up
a blood-stained trophy.

137
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,766
-I'm sorry, Sang-yeon.
-It's okay.

138
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:34,435
I'm not dead yet.

139
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,688
I should have seen that coming.

140
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,232
It was my fault.

141
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:42,819
I should have calculated
the moves all the way to the end.

142
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,738
Here are all the hidden rules of Unknown.

143
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,573
RULES OF UNKNOWN

144
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,367
So we were right about three in a row.

145
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,535
Diagonally.

146
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:54,122
IF 3 SQUARES ARE THE SAME COLOR IN A ROW
(INCLUDING DIAGONALS), GO AGAIN

147
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,040
Please move your own counter again.

148
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,500
There's nothing about four.

149
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,168
"Three or more squares of the same color."

150
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,004
-I thought there was more to it.
-No. Same as three.

151
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,590
Then, that means I misunderstood.

152
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,592
So, which rules didn't we figure out?

153
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:07,593
Yellow.

154
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,012
IF YELLOW, YOU MAY MOVE ANY COUNTER
REGARDLESS OF COLOR

155
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:13,683
Park Sang-yeon was able to move
one more square at this point

156
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,936
not because he had
three yellow squares in his vicinity,

157
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:20,857
but because he had
three yellow squares in a row diagonally.

158
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,110
But didn't I get one extra move earlier
when I changed to yellow?

159
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:29,115
In this situation,
he didn't have three in a row,

160
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:32,326
so he did not get an extra move.

161
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,371
Here is the players' ranking.

162
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:40,042
Players ranking first to fifth
will be awarded Pieces.

163
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,252
For real?

164
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:43,880
Kang Ji-yeong is awarded three Pieces,

165
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:48,259
while 7high, Lee Se-dol, Justin Min,

166
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:52,555
and Yoon So-hui are awarded
one Piece each.

167
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,725
Here are the prize mission results.

168
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,269
Since nobody was eliminated,

169
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:00,271
no money will be added to the prize fund.

170
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,941
Here is the current Piece count
of each player now.

171
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:09,947
Kim Ha-rin, 7high,
Lee Se-dol and Justin Min

172
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,657
all have the same number of Pieces.

173
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,826
Why do I still only have one Piece?

174
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,287
Yoon So-hui, the player with most Pieces,

175
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:19,457
please choose one player
who will go to the living area.

176
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,833
Please send me to prison.

177
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,376
I really had so much fun in there.

178
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,378
So, they're burdening you with this.

179
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:27,423
-I had no idea that it would be like this.
-I'm being frank.

180
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,342
Four people with two Pieces,
not three people.

181
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:30,551
Ha-rin, go to the living area.

182
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,595
She'll probably choose 7high.

183
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:35,097
-True.
-Since they worked together.

184
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,807
-What do you think?
-Switch it up?

185
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,309
I don't know.

186
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:42,438
I'm sure they'll tell you,
but I think there is something in prison.

187
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,732
If there is,
I'm definitely going to try it.

188
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,859
I think it's that thing we know.

189
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:47,944
Right.

190
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,862
-Where you need to risk it all.
-Right.

191
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,739
I will…

192
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,783
I feel terrible. What should I do?

193
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,118
-What's taking so long?
-I guess she's conflicted.

194
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,828
Isn't she just taking 7high?

195
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,830
Wait. It's better if 7high goes.

196
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,709
What are you so conflicted about?
Didn't you decide to take 7high?

197
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,420
She's not happy
about everyone being so divided.

198
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:07,338
Don't be.

199
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:10,132
I don't want that rift
to be cemented tomorrow.

200
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,801
Just do it.

201
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,678
I choose

202
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:17,139
7high to come to the living area.

203
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,644
All the same members can return to prison.

204
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,062
-That's better.
-It is.

205
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:26,023
It's better for only us to know
that thing below.

206
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,858
-We have to do that tomorrow morning.
-Yeah.

207
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,027
Did you get your Pieces? Let me see.

208
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,071
Yeah. Are they different today?

209
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:34,949
Kim Ha-rin,

210
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,409
Son Eun-yu,

211
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:37,743
Choi Hyun-joon,

212
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,120
Lee Se-dol,

213
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:40,580
Justin Min,

214
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,039
Park Sang-yeon,

215
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,750
it has been decided
that you will be in the prison block.

216
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:48,504
All players, please make your way
to your assigned accommodations.

217
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,882
-We're sorry we asked too much of you.
-You'll be fine.

218
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:52,842
I'm sorry.

219
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,138
-Sang-yeon. Come back alive.
-Okay.

220
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:58,556
We'll be cheering for you.

221
00:09:58,639 --> 00:09:59,599
Bye, Ji-yeong.

222
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:01,767
See you alive tomorrow!

223
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,437
Sang-yeon grabbed a corn dog. Good idea.

224
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,938
Hurry up and eat it.

225
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,441
-They take everything.
-They'll take this away?

226
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:10,818
Finish it before you lose it. Hurry up!

227
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:12,653
-You have to give it up.
-Eat it!

228
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,113
-Quickly.
-Shove it in your mouth!

229
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,198
I'll take that corn dog.

230
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,619
You should've just shoved it
in your mouth.

231
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:21,746
That's hilarious.

232
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:26,626
Players may now make their way
to the living area.

233
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,669
Still, I'm so glad you won.

234
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:30,630
I mean it.

235
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,632
Jeez, this is a scary place.

236
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,092
No, it's not that bad.

237
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,761
I've stacked up a bad reputation.

238
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:40,181
That's true.
You could actually call this karma.

239
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:43,059
You swung your sword around too much.

240
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,727
You were bound to get slashed yourself.

241
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,479
You went head first into battle.

242
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:47,521
Yeah, that's right.

243
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:49,899
Here we are again.

244
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,446
Still, it's nice to be back with Se-dol.

245
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:57,865
It turns out, I was made for prison.

246
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,409
It's comfy and feels like home.

247
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,746
It's nice to be back here with friends.

248
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,873
Like being dragged off
to the slaughterhouse.

249
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,833
I didn't know if I'd survive it.

250
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,585
Don't worry. It's a livable space.

251
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,590
Sang-yeon, we'll give you the tour.
First, get changed.

252
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:15,508
Clothes.

253
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:16,634
I see.

254
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:19,595
You're okay, right?
Are you having a breakdown?

255
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,721
Yes, a bit.

256
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:23,599
Let's chat over dinner.

257
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:34,151
Tomorrow, it would be better for us
not to be divided like this.

258
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,612
It's getting too polar,
the prison versus the living area.

259
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,239
They did fire the first shots.

260
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:40,324
True, we didn't create this situation,

261
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:43,786
but I just hope
we can avoid this sort of vibe tomorrow.

262
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:47,415
I'm asking this out of curiosity.

263
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,542
Would you still be
reluctant to pull the trigger

264
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,877
if we played the same game again?

265
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:58,592
In the end, this is a game
and only one of us can win.

266
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,928
-People will have to go home.
-Right.

267
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:03,013
"Did we really have to be so cruel?"

268
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,850
I don't have
any moral objections like that.

269
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:09,729
Some fighting spirit is needed
if we want to tap into deeper potential.

270
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,523
Beating people up with a righteous cause

271
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:14,525
doesn't make you a good player.

272
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,610
The one who survives is.

273
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,279
Objectively speaking,

274
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:22,950
the living area team is
in a pretty good situation right now.

275
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:25,244
We're already in a superior position
in terms of Pieces.

276
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:29,373
Whether you're in the living area
or on the verge of death in prison

277
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:33,586
will inevitably affect your condition
and performance in the game the next day.

278
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:36,255
-In any case, tomorrow…
-It feels like four days have passed.

279
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:38,048
I will once again play for survival.

280
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,341
-I'm sure we all will.
-Yeah.

281
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,635
I'm sure we will. Okay.

282
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:44,889
Forget about playing for someone else
or saving someone from prison.

283
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:47,099
Let's just play for survival.

284
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,059
In any case, as per the rules,

285
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:52,772
one of us will have to leave every day.

286
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,815
We can't all continue to be
of the same mind.

287
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,692
What a headache.

288
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,152
What did you all talk about?

289
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:02,198
7high's point was that sending people home
is just a part of the game.

290
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,742
He's not wrong.
We can't stay together forever.

291
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:07,912
Right. And I actually had
no reason to help him.

292
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:08,954
Why not?

293
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:13,501
7high and I never had anything.
I was just following after you.

294
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,461
-If I'm being honest, so am I.
-Exactly.

295
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:19,173
I would've switched sides for a Piece
since it's a good enough reason to do so.

296
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:21,175
From now on, I'm going to avoid alliances,

297
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:22,635
especially with 7high.

298
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,678
If we end up enemies, so be it.

299
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:27,056
Prison isn't all bad, it's just that…

300
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,644
we just need to figure out how to proceed.

301
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:34,104
Let's think after the death match.

302
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,314
Me.

303
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:08,389
Wow, Justin.

304
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,516
-I like it.
-Yeah. Yeah.

305
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,812
Hey. Did you hear?

306
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,939
-What?
-Justin's so cool.

307
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:17,898
Why?

308
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:21,068
He suggested that we get rid of Sang-yeon
during the death match.

309
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:22,570
Isn't that a given?

310
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:23,654
Really?

311
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:27,324
If we tell him, there's a good chance
he'll spill the beans tomorrow.

312
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,993
-I'm saying in the death match…
-I agree.

313
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,036
…if the opportunity ever arises--

314
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,455
We lay him down to rest, you know.

315
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,292
You certainly have a way with words.

316
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,544
Okay, we will talk after the game.

317
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:39,753
Let's see what the game is.

318
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,380
-Then we'll find out.
-Yeah.

319
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:43,591
Friends?

320
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:48,137
They're not my friends.

321
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,389
Looks like our dinner is here.

322
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:53,475
-Delicious bread.
-There's a certain vibe to food in prison.

323
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,393
Really?

324
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:55,853
-It's good.
-You'll know when you take a bite.

325
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:57,313
What did you have for dinner?

326
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,023
In the living area? Beef.

327
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:00,149
Really?

328
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,358
There are lots of side dishes.

329
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,819
It felt like a banquet for a king.

330
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:06,864
This is better than yesterday's.

331
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:07,781
Is it?

332
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:10,159
Today's bread has a bit of salt in it.

333
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,577
Yesterday, it was a bit bland.

334
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:15,581
We've become bread experts.

335
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,334
The bread was so stale.

336
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:23,797
Like it had been left out for a few hours.

337
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,592
The prison block must be hyped
about the fresh fish.

338
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:30,012
"Hey, newbie. Kneel down."
They must be hazing him.

339
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,847
They'll start with the prison uniform.

340
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,308
-It's obvious.
-No, they wouldn't do that.

341
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:37,561
More like, "You let those bad guys
control you and look where you ended up."

342
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,105
"What's in it for you?
You're stuck here in prison."

343
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,231
No, they won't do that.

344
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,399
Is it gaslighting?

345
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:46,320
But it's a fact that
our youngest went to prison.

346
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:48,322
It must be like night and day for you.

347
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,824
You were over there on the first day.

348
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:55,120
So yesterday, I was the worst player

349
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,957
but I was the only one saved
which bothered me.

350
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,668
Today, I did so much for my alliance

351
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:03,921
but they still abandoned me
and sent me to prison, which bothers me.

352
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:06,256
I didn't realize
you were doing all that for them.

353
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:10,928
They just had you as cannon fodder,
so they wouldn't get blood on their hands.

354
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:14,264
They hide away and pretend to be innocent.

355
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:15,516
What's up with that?

356
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:20,562
He was still involved
in the whole process.

357
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,399
-Do you think we took advantage of him?
-No, no.

358
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:27,277
I'm sure Sang-yeon can discern that,
but he'll probably joke about it.

359
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:30,155
Since he's the only one
that ended up in prison,

360
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:33,325
-I do think he might feel tempted.
-Of course, that's a given.

361
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:34,702
It'll be up to him to decide.

362
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:38,122
Tomorrow, I want to completely
knock out their alliance.

363
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,373
-Their alliance?
-Yes.

364
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:41,709
-How?
-I want to make it so they have no Pieces.

365
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:44,169
Are you saying you want to? Or what?

366
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:47,965
Because you seem quite tight with them.
Aren't you and them close?

367
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:49,717
I was betrayed by them.

368
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,093
They betrayed you?

369
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,053
Right, that's why I'm here.

370
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,722
They could've waited to put Ji-yeong in

371
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:59,143
to give me a chance to acquire some points
and a Piece to save me with the vote,

372
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,478
but they didn't
and told me to go to prison.

373
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:05,232
Let's be honest,
I swung my sword around the most today,

374
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:07,067
yet they send me here?

375
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:10,154
-I see your point.
-In conclusion, they did use you.

376
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:13,407
They're not taking responsibility
for your survival.

377
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,825
I didn't mean any of it.

378
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:16,618
I just needed to win them over.

379
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:20,831
I don't believe my feelings
towards the alliance have changed at all.

380
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:25,252
I just hope I get the chance
to make up the difference in Pieces.

381
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:27,796
So, I want to give that a try today.

382
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,298
What?

383
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,300
What Seung-hyun did yesterday.

384
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,179
I think everyone wants to.

385
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:36,597
I have to do it today.

386
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,267
No, reel it in.
We already have a room full of people.

387
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:43,312
-Everyone feels the same.
-We all want to give it a go.

388
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:46,148
That's why we're here.

389
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:49,234
I'm really curious about what the game is.
I wish I could ask her.

390
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:50,527
What do you think it is?

391
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:53,447
It couldn't have been Knight's Tour.

392
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,492
No, I still think it could've been that.

393
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,828
It's probably a 7x7 board
where you have to actually stand in it.

394
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:03,290
7high, I have something to tell you.

395
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:06,460
I want to give you the Piece I got today.

396
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:10,756
I was originally intending
to help the ones with fewer Pieces,

397
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:12,966
but I didn't know I'd get fifth place.

398
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,469
-That's all her.
-One more can only help.

399
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:16,804
Take it.

400
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,555
-Congratulations.
-You earned it.

401
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:22,559
Today, I felt that the value of a Piece

402
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,311
was unimaginably high.

403
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:27,314
Regardless,
he's been with us this whole time.

404
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:31,902
But he has the fewest Pieces
out of us, so that was why.

405
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,195
Afterward, Yoon So-hui…

406
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,738
Later, I'll be like, "Yikes!"

407
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,282
"Redo! I take it back!"

408
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,327
"Who would you like to eliminate?"
"7high, please."

409
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,623
She's asking if she can have it back.

410
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:47,459
"That was mine to begin with!"

411
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:50,212
I'll go home if it's by So-hui's hand.

412
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,255
"That was mine!"

413
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:52,381
I'd leave.

414
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:53,715
What an annoying thing to say.

415
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,175
What happened over there?

416
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,927
Do you mean the secret?

417
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:57,845
Yes.

418
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:00,472
If I tell you, will you forgive me?

419
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:01,765
Come on.

420
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:05,686
I need to win these people over
if I don't want to be screwed over.

421
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:07,646
There's a secret in the gym.

422
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:09,523
It's not just for working out?

423
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:11,066
And over there,

424
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,402
there's something
that doesn't work properly.

425
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:14,820
There's a puzzle to solve on it,

426
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:16,989
and then, you get this wrench.

427
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:19,616
-And then?
-You use that to turn to open something.

428
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,704
Even if we end up there tomorrow,
it'll probably be impossible to do.

429
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:25,330
The next day as well.

430
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:28,375
Because you need four different kinds
of Pieces to solve it.

431
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,294
-Different Pieces?
-They were all the same yesterday.

432
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:31,461
Is today's Piece different?

433
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,839
-Se-dol, is the Piece you got different?
-Maybe?

434
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:34,756
Can I take a look?

435
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,592
It might even be something like this!

436
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,511
The Pieces have four different sides,
and there are these slots.

437
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:40,888
The Pieces act like a key.

438
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,723
Right, not four Pieces but four sides.

439
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:43,765
Exactly.

440
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:48,020
Ji-yeong got three today.
They must have solved it already.

441
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:50,772
Since they still probably think
they need four different types,

442
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,524
-they may not know yet.
-Is this the same?

443
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:58,697
Did you get your Pieces? Let me see.

444
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:03,035
After confirming they were the same,
I realized we were missing something.

445
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,455
Some of the pictures
are flipped horizontally,

446
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:10,375
some are upside down, and
there was this sort of repetition to them.

447
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:14,254
Does the shape of a snake appear
when you fill them in?

448
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:17,716
Or you get something
if you draw the patternless ones?

449
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:21,803
Let's rest for a while.

450
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,930
Hyun-gyu.

451
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:25,766
-Take a break, Hyun-gyu.
-I feel like suddenly we'll hear this.

452
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:27,100
"Park Hyun-gyu."

453
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,020
-It's Jeong, not Park.
-My bad. "Jeong Hyun-gyu…"

454
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,563
Is it really the right direction?

455
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,523
I have to investigate it a bit further,

456
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,317
but this is undoubtedly a key.

457
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:36,985
Good luck.

458
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,154
-Hyun-gyu, what are you up to?
-Yes?

459
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,656
I'm trying to solve this.

460
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:43,158
So, this is the order they go in, right?

461
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,243
I'm not sure.

462
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,410
Okay.

463
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,497
Do you see anything?

464
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:51,416
I'm doing my best to see if I can.

465
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,377
There was nothing else to do anyway.

466
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,546
I was fully prepared
to pull an all-nighter if need be.

467
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,602
There is one possibility.

468
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,062
Do you put them in?

469
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:15,274
No. I would try it if I had eight,
but I only have four.

470
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:19,027
We were worried about them announcing,
"Park Hyun-gyu."

471
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,654
It's Jeong Hyun-gyu.

472
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:23,991
I have a friend named Park Hyun-gyu.
Sorry. Jeong Hyun-gyu.

473
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:25,409
So-hui, can you check for me?

474
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,828
-Shall I? Two Pieces…
-Go and take a look.

475
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,955
"Jeong Hyun-gyu, Yoon So-hui have been…"

476
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,499
-Eliminated!
-"Eliminated!"

477
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:33,959
The pattern repeats.

478
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:36,086
-Really?
-The image repeats.

479
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:38,213
This is the one I'm most certain of.

480
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:41,717
Do you see it?
This snake is exactly the same. See?

481
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,220
This one is exactly the same, right?

482
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:48,307
I think this one could go here.

483
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,225
And it seems
we haven't gotten this one yet.

484
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,185
-Maybe here?
-Yeah, this one?

485
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,687
This one is a bit different.

486
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,606
You're right.
The throats face different directions.

487
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:00,152
Seeing as how this pattern
and the images in it are replicated,

488
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:03,196
I thought it might not have anything
to do with the pictures.

489
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,199
But I definitely believe
this is the way to go.

490
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,534
This one?

491
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:11,079
This won't be easy. You might
never see it again if you drop it in here.

492
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:14,374
-Don't drop mine in.
-If I do, I'll give you mine.

493
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:18,337
Nothing springs to mind.

494
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,840
What I'm sure of is that the pattern
on the back is completely different.

495
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:23,175
You can't find it here.

496
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:25,302
-You're talking about this?
-Yes.

497
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:28,889
He discovered similarities,
but there were no certainties.

498
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:32,184
It didn't seem like it would just end
with the images, and he agreed.

499
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:34,519
So I just tried putting one in.

500
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:38,732
The patterns didn't match up exactly,
but I thought maybe one would fit.

501
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:41,151
So, I put it in the second slot halfway…

502
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:49,743
Hey, doesn't it say, "insert"?

503
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:51,787
It says, "insert."

504
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,413
We saw "insert," so…

505
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:55,916
-Maybe this is it?
-Amazing.

506
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:57,459
It says, "insert," right?

507
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:58,377
Hold on.

508
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:02,005
Right? You get "insert"
if you put it in like that.

509
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:04,341
We might see different English words

510
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:06,843
if we make different combinations.

511
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:08,470
But it didn't work for any of the others.

512
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:12,432
It didn't seem like the others
went together with the images, so…

513
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:14,101
We may need to insert one.

514
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:16,645
-Four is a lot. Maybe just one? Hold on.
-Oh, just one.

515
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,355
On the "insert" one.

516
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:21,149
-Should we tell the others? Should we?
-No.

517
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,735
There were seven clocks.

518
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,946
This might just be for one player to win.

519
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,364
-Alone?
-Right.

520
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:28,532
It could be.

521
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:31,535
I don't think they would want to go in,
even if we told them.

522
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:32,828
Do you want to put one in?

523
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:35,872
I would, but I gave one to 7high just now.

524
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:36,915
Why?

525
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:40,961
I felt weird about winning one today,
and I thought it'd smooth things over.

526
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:43,588
-I didn't see this coming.
-Are you putting one in or not?

527
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:44,840
It doesn't matter to me.

528
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,591
I overthought this.

529
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,261
Well done. I only got this
because of all your work.

530
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:51,304
How did we just do it?
I think it was this.

531
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:54,182
You put this one in
for "insert" to appear. Amazing.

532
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,475
That's really amazing.

533
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:58,353
This must be it.
You only need to put it in this slot.

534
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:01,189
What are we going to do?
Think it over carefully.

535
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,608
-Why?
-If you do it now, you have to play.

536
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,986
-Okay, then, after dinner.
-Let's eat first.

537
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,196
This is so fun.

538
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,781
Amazing.

539
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,700
Any progress?

540
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,660
-Do you want to see?
-You got something.

541
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:15,704
Please keep this a secret.

542
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:19,249
I tried it all
but the patterns are random,

543
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:21,209
and I couldn't get any of them to match,

544
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,294
except this one.

545
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:23,420
"Insert."

546
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,589
Isn't that amazing?

547
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:26,673
You put one in?

548
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:28,341
Isn't that amazing?

549
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:29,551
Did you just put one in?

550
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,052
-What's that?
-That's insane.

551
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,762
It opens with just one?

552
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:56,661
THE DEVIL'S PLAN
DEATH ROOM

553
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,663
-What's that?
-That's insane.

554
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,123
It opens with just one?

555
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,419
I saw a completely white room.

556
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:06,671
I mean, wow.

557
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:09,174
The only thing in my mind was fear.

558
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:11,301
The door opened,
and there was a white room.

559
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:13,303
And I could see a single Piece.

560
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:14,387
There's a Piece.

561
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:15,514
Don't go in just yet.

562
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:18,350
-I'm going in.
-But there are no instructions.

563
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:20,310
Just entering shouldn't be an issue.

564
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:22,479
Wow, this is amazing. It's so awesome.

565
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:24,272
This must be for whoever put it in.

566
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,776
WELCOME TO THE HIDDEN STAGE

567
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:30,445
"Only one player may enter.
There will be one opportunity."

568
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:31,821
Go for it. It was your Piece.

569
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:34,533
-No, don't do it.
-I got my refund already.

570
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:36,368
IF YOU SUCCEED IN THE HIDDEN STAGE,

571
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:38,745
YOU'LL BE IN A BETTER POSITION
TO REACH THE FINAL

572
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:39,871
I won't be eliminated.

573
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,456
Then, you have to go for it.

574
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,709
-There's bound to be some kind of penalty.
-Go and come back.

575
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,169
Don't.

576
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:48,505
PLEASE LEAVE
IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO PROCEED

577
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,800
Are you going to do it? Really?

578
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:55,220
We've come all this way,
I should keep going.

579
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:56,805
He won't be eliminated anyway.

580
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,223
I have to go.

581
00:25:58,306 --> 00:25:59,933
-He won't be eliminated.
-No dinner?

582
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:02,978
Hyun-gyu, do it after dinner.

583
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,854
You can't do it on an empty stomach.

584
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:07,190
It says we should leave
if we're not proceeding.

585
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:08,567
I will be back after dinner.

586
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:09,734
Wow. Awesome.

587
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:12,195
If you're set on it,
at least do it after dinner.

588
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,113
Are you my mom?

589
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:15,615
You always have to eat first,
no matter what you do.

590
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:17,867
-Is it really only for one person?
-Yes.

591
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:19,202
Do you want to go?

592
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:21,162
Yes, but you go.

593
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,248
You've been working on it since yesterday.

594
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:24,708
I'll give you a Piece.

595
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,335
When you get back? Thanks.

596
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,254
So, was I not helpful at all?

597
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:30,880
You got the clocks.

598
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:32,257
Yeah, that's true.

599
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,800
Just in case he forgot.

600
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:34,968
Stand in line.

601
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:36,261
Just advocating for myself.

602
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:39,681
In case your contribution was forgotten.
A gentle reminder.

603
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:40,974
He probably did forget.

604
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:43,435
Good thing you reminded him.

605
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:45,729
Should we try to figure out
what game it will be?

606
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:47,939
Maybe Knight's Tour?
Because it's a solo game?

607
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:50,108
-That's all I can think of.
-I should practice.

608
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:51,318
Yeah, go and practice.

609
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:53,320
Yes, I plan to.

610
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:55,238
What happens now that you told us?

611
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:56,448
Why can't I share it?

612
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:58,199
They won't know until the show airs.

613
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:00,869
I suppose so.

614
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,704
How pragmatic.

615
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,664
He spoke very frankly,

616
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:08,668
but that could mean
the exact opposite could also happen.

617
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:12,797
Well…

618
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,008
Did he go for his interview?

619
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:16,593
-What?
-Did he go?

620
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:17,636
Yes, Sang-yeon left.

621
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:23,141
Oh, yeah. We should… Right now is perfect.

622
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:28,563
I feel bad because
Sang-yeon has been so forth-coming.

623
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:31,733
Maybe for today's prison game…

624
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:36,529
Oh! Sang-yeon? Gosh.

625
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,448
We did talk about it.

626
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:40,659
That would ensure
this secret doesn't get out.

627
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,035
Right now, we're thinking

628
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:46,039
it would be best for Sang-yeon
to leave after the prison match

629
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:50,794
and for us
to continue keeping this a secret,

630
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:53,213
but we're not sure
if it'll go according to plan.

631
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:54,964
What's that?

632
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:56,007
It's eight o'clock.

633
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:59,552
The prison match will begin in 30 minutes.

634
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:03,973
At the end of the prison match,
one player will be eliminated

635
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:06,017
and leave The Devil's Plan.

636
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,353
That startled me.

637
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:10,313
I still get surprised every time.

638
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:13,400
Let me now explain
the second prison match,

639
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:16,444
which will lead to the third elimination.

640
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,196
Today's prison match is

641
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:19,739
Time Auction.

642
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:21,032
Time Auction?

643
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,827
Players must place bids
within a certain amount of time

644
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:26,037
and winning bids
will be awarded victory tokens.

645
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,372
An auction should be fun.

646
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:29,416
Before the start of the auction,

647
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:33,169
each player will be awarded
a fund of 10 minutes.

648
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:36,548
Those 10 minutes must last
19 rounds of bids

649
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:39,551
and will be measured to
the nearest tenth of a second.

650
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:40,969
Tenth of a second.

651
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:43,638
Each player will have a button
in front of them

652
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,558
that is shielded from the view
of the other players.

653
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:52,605
Each round shall start with all players
holding their button down.

654
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:53,982
When the auction starts,

655
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:56,276
there shall be a five-second countdown

656
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:59,821
and the players' time reserves
will start counting down.

657
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:03,742
If you do not wish to participate
in a particular round,

658
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:06,411
you can forfeit
by removing your hand from the button

659
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:08,371
before the countdown ends.

660
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:14,586
Participating players can release
their button to bid the amount of time

661
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:17,839
that has elapsed from their reserves.

662
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:21,551
When the last remaining player
releases their button,

663
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:23,470
the time on the scoreboard will stop.

664
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:27,390
Having bid the most time for the round,

665
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:30,560
they shall be awarded a victory token.

666
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:36,357
If two or more bid the same amount of time
to within one-tenth of a second,

667
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:40,153
no victory token shall be awarded
for that round.

668
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:41,696
It becomes annulled?

669
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:45,074
The participants of each auction
will not be made public.

670
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:48,328
Only the winning bidder
for that round shall be revealed.

671
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:50,789
The time remaining
in the players' reserves

672
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:54,125
shall not be disclosed
to other players or even to themselves.

673
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,377
They can only be checked on the scoreboard

674
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:59,172
when an auction is in progress.

675
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:02,842
In other words, each player must remember
exactly how much time they have used

676
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:04,969
before they participate in an auction.

677
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,429
You have to keep track.

678
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:10,767
At the end of 19 rounds,
the player with the most winning bids

679
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,936
shall be awarded one Piece.

680
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,855
If there is a tie,

681
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:20,193
the player with more reserve time
remaining shall be awarded the Piece.

682
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:22,862
However, if they both have
the same amount of time left,

683
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:25,490
no Piece will be awarded.

684
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:27,158
So you have to save a lot of time.

685
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:29,077
The player with the least winning bids

686
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,663
shall be eliminated from The Devil's Plan.

687
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:33,456
In the event of a tie,

688
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:36,751
the player with the least remaining time
shall be eliminated.

689
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:41,172
The game will now begin in 30 minutes.

690
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,967
But luckily, it's an individual game.

691
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:48,054
Acquire as many points as you can
while saving as much time as possible.

692
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:53,142
What? How?

693
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,492
I guess it is possible like that.

694
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,625
I'm not sure
if everyone will agree though.

695
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,920
I do get what you're saying.

696
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,842
So what do I do about this?

697
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:27,719
It sounds like such a fun game.

698
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:29,888
Se-dol is getting excited.

699
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:34,893
Why do you look so down?

700
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:37,937
There's no real strategy,
since it's a time auction.

701
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:43,526
Are you going to do it?

702
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,820
I haven't talked to Se-dol yet.

703
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:47,947
Then, are we going to do it?

704
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:51,492
But it won't be the five versus one
we were talking about just now.

705
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,709
This game will be
completely individual play, right?

706
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:03,087
If you get four, you're safe.
You can't be eliminated.

707
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,297
Just win four early on?

708
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,840
You could try that strategy

709
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,426
or you could also try going
for four at the end.

710
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:11,638
I think you should try
and get the wins early in Rounds 2 or 3.

711
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:14,265
But how many will think the same?

712
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,392
-That would be the worst.
-Absolutely.

713
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:24,901
Our Hyun-gyu is busy
preparing for his trip.

714
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:26,569
Busy getting ready for your trip?

715
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:30,365
I'm just trying this and that,
looking into all possible solutions.

716
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:31,950
But it might not be this.

717
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:32,951
True.

718
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:35,495
I've almost memorized it.

719
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:37,288
I might have to go in blind.

720
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:41,000
-Has he gone in?
-Not yet.

721
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,210
He's there practicing.

722
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:43,670
And if I just charge in there?

723
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:49,008
I never thought of that.
That would be the ultimate twist.

724
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,134
It would be fun.

725
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,762
7, 9…

726
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:55,056
1, 7…

727
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:57,433
I memorized it all,

728
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,727
but I assume
they won't give the same grid.

729
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,646
I memorized it in numerical order,

730
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:06,651
and then, I divided the pattern into two
on a blank board and memorized it again.

731
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:09,696
I memorized it in shapes,
and I considered many possibilities.

732
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:11,489
I even memorized it in reverse.

733
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:14,659
Once he sets off,
it'll just be the five of us.

734
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:16,077
That's not very many.

735
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,454
That's because Sang-yeon is missing.

736
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,380
-All memorized?
-Yes.

737
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:29,215
Cut and clean. You're perfect.

738
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:31,634
Before you go in,
we're going to give you a test.

739
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:33,386
We'll test you before we let you go.

740
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:35,013
It's time to go.

741
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:35,930
Let's go.

742
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,683
The prison match will begin shortly.

743
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:42,937
All players in the prison block,
please make your way to the death room.

744
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:45,732
-Good luck, everyone.
-Good luck.

745
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:47,442
Good luck.

746
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,152
Let's go!

747
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:50,278
Let's have some fun.

748
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:05,752
Players may take up any spot they wish.

749
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:07,045
I'm going to go here.

750
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:09,547
You can't see?

751
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,215
We really can't see?

752
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:14,677
So this is how you press it.

753
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,138
With all the mirrors,

754
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:20,391
I thought maybe I could
see the hands of the others.

755
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:21,893
They're watching.

756
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:25,688
I think you put your hand in there
so they can't see.

757
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,648
-So you can bluff.
-You certainly can.

758
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,984
-Like "I'm pushing it."
-"I'm going all the way."

759
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,027
And don't press at all.

760
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:33,237
Exactly. That's how you do it.
You pressure people.

761
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:37,408
The second prison match,

762
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:39,911
Time Auction, will begin now.

763
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:41,537
Round 1 will now begin.

764
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:44,415
Players, please stand by
while pushing your button.

765
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:58,513
I'm a bit scared of Se-dol now.

766
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:01,432
I think he's so amazing.

767
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:04,393
-I think he'll win and come up here.
-Totally.

768
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,159
Sang-yeon is looking nervous.

769
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,828
Of course. Even I'm nervous.

770
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,246
Sang-yeon, good luck!

771
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:37,426
They're not letting go.

772
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:44,684
Who is it? One minute from the get-go?

773
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:46,144
A whole minute?

774
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:54,360
They're all in it.
They're on the same page.

775
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:55,862
I wouldn't in the first…

776
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:56,946
You'd let go?

777
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:59,991
I think a lot of people think that way,
so they all went for it.

778
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:02,034
But some of them thought the same.

779
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:07,748
Wow, I have no idea.

780
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,625
I can't tell who's still in it at all.

781
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:10,751
No clue.

782
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,343
Right out of the gate.

783
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:24,891
I adjusted my time

784
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:28,853
according to when I thought
the other players would give up.

785
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:32,607
If this is how we're doing it,
let's use five minutes from the start.

786
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,067
-You don't know how far along you are.
-Right.

787
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:38,571
But, you should still have
an idea as to how long you're going for.

788
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:40,615
They're prepared to go for three minutes.

789
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,658
It must be entertaining for the dropouts.

790
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,035
You'll know by the smiles.

791
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:47,705
Justin dropped out. He looks so excited.

792
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:08,643
-It's over.
-Who is it?

793
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,353
The winning bidder for Round 1 is

794
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:11,771
Son Eun-yu.

795
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:13,648
Here is your victory token.

796
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:14,565
Thank you.

797
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:19,237
-Eun-yu did about two minutes?
-I think so.

798
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,655
That could be a strategy.

799
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,615
Just go for it on predetermined rounds.

800
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:25,576
ROUND 1
SON EUN-YU: WIN

801
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,245
Round 2 will now begin.

802
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:30,039
Players, please stand by
while pushing your button.

803
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,177
Sang-yeon, bet wisely.

804
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:46,097
Once you start worrying about
how much a chance will cost you…

805
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,140
-You're bound to get anxious.
-…you start doubting.

806
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,818
I feel like you'll be able to see it.

807
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:00,027
Can you?

808
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:01,654
No.

809
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:03,489
Then I wouldn't be here like this.

810
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:05,074
I'd be so self-destructive.

811
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:09,829
Right to the end? Just keep pushing
right to the end of the ten minutes?

812
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:11,080
I think I'd ruin myself.

813
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:35,146
Did I start off wrong?

814
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:38,149
It was pretty full-on
right from the first round.

815
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:48,743
Two minutes, okay.

816
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:50,828
There's no way to tell at all.

817
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:52,330
You just know yourself.

818
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:53,497
You just know your own.

819
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:55,583
Doing it amidst that uncertainty…

820
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:03,799
-It's 2 minutes, 15 seconds.
-I think it's Eun-yu again.

821
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:05,634
The winning bidder for Round 2 is

822
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:07,803
Kim Ha-rin.

823
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:09,889
Here is your victory token.

824
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:14,602
-They're both doing well.
-Ha-rin and Eun-yu are good.

825
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,312
-They're good.
-They have a head for games.

826
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:17,855
-They have grit.
-Do they like board games?

827
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:20,149
They're both really smart.

828
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:23,694
ROUND 2
KIM HA-RIN: WIN

829
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,572
Round 3 will now begin.

830
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:29,200
Players, please stand by
while pushing your button.

831
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,511
You can't waste too much time.

832
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:51,430
Ha-rin proposed it first,

833
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:52,890
alternating every round.

834
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:54,850
I will only play on even rounds.

835
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:55,851
Then, I go on odds?

836
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:58,521
For more certainty,
the 3 of us can take 6 rounds each.

837
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:01,440
And then, Eun-yu joined us as well.

838
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:03,776
I'll do it like this.
If we do this, that'll work.

839
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:08,239
If it's not your round, you drop out.

840
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:12,201
We did it in multiples of 3
and I took Rounds 3, 6, and 9.

841
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:14,078
The winning bidder for Round 1 is
Son Eun-yu.

842
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:16,205
The winning bidder for Round 2 is
Kim Ha-rin.

843
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:24,380
At the start,
I suggested we all work together.

844
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,301
I guess it is possible like that.

845
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:31,053
Are you going to do it?

846
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:32,596
I haven't talked to Se-dol yet.

847
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:36,934
A little while later,

848
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:40,271
the three of them were chatting,

849
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:43,399
so I thought,
"they're gonna work together."

850
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:45,151
I got angry…

851
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:48,737
so I started thinking
about how I could win by myself.

852
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:53,909
I don't know how much time anyone's used.
Apart from these two.

853
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:55,619
There's no way of knowing

854
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:58,080
unless they win the bid.

855
00:40:58,164 --> 00:41:00,124
They've all adopted a 2-minute strategy.

856
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:02,001
Decided on a minimum of 2 minutes.

857
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:04,753
Is a 2-minute decision process
a good way to go?

858
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:09,300
Using more than 30 seconds
is very inefficient.

859
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:11,051
Tell me about it. I think so, too.

860
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,095
It's a game where
time is converted to points.

861
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:16,432
In the end, you need to have a lot
of time in reserve, in case of a tie.

862
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,065
I really didn't see it coming.

863
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:27,276
I thought securing one round would be easy

864
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,487
because the other two had no issues.

865
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,419
The winning bidder for Round 3 is…

866
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:50,090
Lee Se-dol.

867
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:53,344
What a risk-taker.

868
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:55,262
He thought no one would go for it now.

869
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:00,226
Here is your victory token.

870
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:02,019
I wasted too much time.

871
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,397
I was really surprised Lee Se-dol won,

872
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:09,527
but I was mostly worried
about all the time I wasted.

873
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:16,450
ROUND 3
LEE SE-DOL: WIN

874
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:18,744
Round 4 will now begin.

875
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:28,295
Sang-yeon needs to win one quickly.

876
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,505
There's no rush.

877
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:32,216
It's only Round 4.
It's best to note people's patterns.

878
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:56,115
This is quite nerve-racking.
Doing it like this…

879
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:59,535
You don't know if two people are competing
or if just one is holding out.

880
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:02,121
You don't know.
It could also be three people.

881
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:06,584
I think he'll go for the middle rounds.

882
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:10,004
You can estimate how much time
people used up in the early rounds.

883
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:13,299
If it was me, I don't think
I'd do anything until about Round 10.

884
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:25,185
Everyone has such great poker faces.

885
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:28,022
Let's stop now.

886
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:29,148
You're pushing, right?

887
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:30,649
-No.
-Sang-yeon.

888
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,276
I wish it was over already.

889
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:54,298
Looks like they'll go three minutes.

890
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:58,385
What? We're past two minutes.

891
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:00,429
This one's really long.

892
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:04,183
It stopped.

893
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:06,101
The winning bidder for Round 4 is…

894
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:10,564
Park Sang-yeon.

895
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:12,858
Here is your victory token.

896
00:44:13,942 --> 00:44:16,070
Such tenacity.

897
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,323
Good job.

898
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:21,367
Nice, Sang-yeon. That was smart.

899
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:24,870
ROUND 4
PARK SANG-YEON: WIN

900
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:26,622
Round 5 will now begin.

901
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:28,957
Players, please stand by
while pushing your button.

902
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:43,639
I'm guessing
Justin will go for it in Round 10.

903
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:45,974
Because he did that
for the first prison match.

904
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:49,186
He didn't do much early on
and bet everything at the end.

905
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:57,444
Have you been doing
a lot of pressing, Justin?

906
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,363
How much time have you used up so far?

907
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,157
I need to win one.

908
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:09,206
Is one minute the baseline now?
Is that how we're playing this?

909
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:11,375
I don't even know who's pressing down.

910
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:14,795
People should start dropping out now.

911
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:19,800
It'll pass two minutes.

912
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:20,843
I think it will.

913
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:22,469
That will be the minimum now.

914
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:25,013
They're probably thinking
that this is enough.

915
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:27,558
Now, if they put their minds
to it and go for three…

916
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:40,320
This is long.

917
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:54,042
I think someone passed 2 minutes
but lost to 2 minutes 9 seconds.

918
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:56,295
I think that's why
they're sticking it out now.

919
00:45:56,378 --> 00:45:57,713
We're going to hit three minutes.

920
00:45:57,796 --> 00:46:00,507
Honestly, three minutes?
You're better off not winning.

921
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:08,557
So tenacious.

922
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,893
The winning bidder for Round 5 is
Kim Ha-rin.

923
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:12,811
-Tenacious.
-Here is your victory token.

924
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:15,355
Good.

925
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:18,150
Ha-rin… She is a great player.

926
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:19,485
Two is pretty good.

927
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:23,363
Ha-rin won't be happy with two,
and she'll be wanting the Piece.

928
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:26,408
ROUND 5
KIM HA-RIN: WIN

929
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:28,285
Round 6 will now begin.

930
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:31,371
Players, please stand by
while pushing your button.

931
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:45,177
I think if you're there pushing it,
it'll feel really long.

932
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:48,514
You'll be second-guessing yourself
the whole time.

933
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:04,613
You didn't lift yet?

934
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:14,206
At first, I think we assumed

935
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:16,667
it would be about a minute,

936
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:19,127
but then, Se-dol won, so I thought,

937
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:21,630
"Oh, even if I have to use up some time,

938
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:25,425
I have to win to get a victory token."

939
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:29,012
I think Sang-yeon is still pressing.

940
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:31,598
-I think I'm in big trouble.
-Did I get you?

941
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:33,308
I'm in trouble.

942
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:34,852
Yup. Keep bluffing.

943
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:37,312
The problem is that now

944
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:40,357
people are going to use up
more than 2 minutes and 20 seconds.

945
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,901
It's human nature to think
you have to do more

946
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:45,946
than whatever is in front of you
if you want to win.

947
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:50,075
I feel like it's about time for Justin
to make a move. Or maybe Hyun-joon?

948
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:03,005
Saving ten seconds is
completely meaningless without a token.

949
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:06,174
So, I decided to see
how far everyone was willing to go.

950
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:12,264
Who's the crazy person
pressing down still?

951
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:14,850
Then, it turns out to be you.

952
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:15,851
I know.

953
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:19,605
Se-dol, you're not the crazy one, right?

954
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:20,814
Seriously…

955
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,152
There's no middle ground. None at all.

956
00:48:25,944 --> 00:48:27,613
Go until you die.

957
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:29,823
You told us we shouldn't go
past three minutes.

958
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:31,950
Did that mean you were going to?

959
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:39,875
-Long enough to brush my teeth.
-Honestly, 3 minutes…

960
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:44,963
Who is it?

961
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:46,632
The winning bidder for Round 6 is

962
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:47,674
Choi Hyun-joon.

963
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,302
-Who was it?
-Here is your victory token.

964
00:48:50,385 --> 00:48:53,055
You little twerp. It was you?
You're really something else.

965
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:55,307
These twerps are ridiculous.

966
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:57,601
I shouldn't associate with them.

967
00:48:58,268 --> 00:48:59,519
Wait, did Se-dol…

968
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:01,355
He must have hung in there for a while.

969
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:03,148
Hyun-joon didn't have one.

970
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:05,275
He went for three minutes
because he didn't.

971
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,694
I think he took Se-dol
with him for most of the way.

972
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:09,112
I had no idea. Damn it.

973
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:11,907
We're still just tied now.
I'm scared enough as it is.

974
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:13,992
I knew it. I did.

975
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:15,535
I'm sorry.

976
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:17,454
I actually never pressed it.

977
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:20,040
I just pretended like I did.
It wasn't exactly bluffing.

978
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:23,961
ROUND 6
CHOI HYUN-JOON: WIN

979
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:26,838
Maybe Justin hasn't used any time yet?

980
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:28,340
Is he that kind of person?

981
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:30,050
Round 7 will now begin.

982
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:33,053
Players, please stand by
while pushing your button.

983
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:41,937
Is this the seventh round?

984
00:49:42,437 --> 00:49:43,271
Yes.

985
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:46,149
You probably don't even remember
how much time you've used.

986
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:47,317
I do.

987
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:52,739
I'm unsure about Justin
because his time hasn't been revealed yet.

988
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:54,658
Sang-yeon's gotten very quiet.

989
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:55,784
Yes.

990
00:49:55,867 --> 00:50:00,205
It looks like he's in a lonely battle.
What if everyone's already let go?

991
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:02,791
-Darn it.
-Or maybe not.

992
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:05,711
Sang-yeon looks pretty anxious.

993
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:07,504
He's so tense.

994
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:15,178
This is another long one.

995
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:18,473
Is it 20 seconds?

996
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:19,641
It is.

997
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:20,767
Who is it?

998
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:23,812
The winning bidder for Round 7 is
Son Eun-yu.

999
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:25,772
-See? Not me.
-Here is your victory token.

1000
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:27,441
It wasn't me, either.

1001
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:30,569
Hold on.

1002
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:31,903
-Is this Round 8?
-Yes, it is.

1003
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:36,950
What the heck?

1004
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:39,828
Are you all stretching to go extra long?

1005
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:43,457
I guess it's hard work to keep pressing.
Just look at them stretching.

1006
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:47,169
I assume everyone in the living area
is watching this live.

1007
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:50,172
Good luck!

1008
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:51,089
Good luck!

1009
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:52,716
Good luck!

1010
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,301
Round 8 will now begin.

1011
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:56,845
Players, please stand by
while pushing your button.

1012
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,568
They couldn't have schemed, right?

1013
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:13,945
No way.

1014
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:15,238
They did have 30 minutes.

1015
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:17,574
I suppose that's enough
to form an alliance.

1016
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:20,160
"You take odds and I'll take evens."
Something like that.

1017
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:22,454
Another long press.

1018
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:26,374
It seems a 2-minute wait is
the minimum required for a win now.

1019
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:27,793
That's the baseline.

1020
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:44,851
You understand?

1021
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:46,728
-Yes, I understand.
-Great.

1022
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:49,981
That was less than two.

1023
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:53,068
-Wow.
-Oh? "1:56."

1024
00:51:53,151 --> 00:51:54,694
That was over quickly.

1025
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:56,196
-Sang-yeon?
-Who is it?

1026
00:51:57,155 --> 00:51:58,782
The winning bidder for Round 8 is…

1027
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:02,202
-Who is it?
-It's me.

1028
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:04,204
The winning bidder for Round 8 is
Lee Se-dol.

1029
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:05,580
Here is your victory token.

1030
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:07,833
You were on the verge of crazy, too.

1031
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:09,042
I just might.

1032
00:52:09,584 --> 00:52:10,502
Cra… Cra-dol.

1033
00:52:10,585 --> 00:52:11,920
Lee Cra-dol.

1034
00:52:12,003 --> 00:52:13,630
-Lee Se-dol, right?
-Se-dol.

1035
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:16,341
Se-dol is done at two minutes, every time.

1036
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:18,093
That was a bit too much.

1037
00:52:18,176 --> 00:52:19,261
It was indeed.

1038
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:27,227
Since we'd been winning around the
2-minute mark during our assigned rounds,

1039
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:31,731
I figured that by Round 8,
before we started hitting double digits,

1040
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:36,111
someone would be anxious enough
to go longer to try to rack up a win.

1041
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:38,905
But just in case nobody played at all,

1042
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:41,283
I thought I'd hang in
for ten extra seconds.

1043
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:47,622
Round 9 will now begin.

1044
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:50,167
Players, please stand by
while pushing your button.

1045
00:52:58,508 --> 00:52:59,593
Justin…

1046
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:01,386
Maybe he doesn't have much time left?

1047
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:05,640
I don't know.

1048
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:08,393
It's better to win as quickly as possible.

1049
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:10,270
-You'll have more time left.
-Right.

1050
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:12,731
Will it go to the anxious Sang-yeon?

1051
00:53:12,814 --> 00:53:13,940
I feel like it might be.

1052
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:15,901
Sang-yeon looks determined.

1053
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:16,860
I think so.

1054
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:20,697
Justin's a bit weird too.

1055
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:22,574
Justin will go for the later rounds.

1056
00:53:22,657 --> 00:53:24,868
-He's acting strangely.
-He's just always smiling.

1057
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:27,204
-I see him grinning.
-He's always weird.

1058
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:29,039
He's happy that
people are using their time.

1059
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:30,790
-That's how it is?
-"Use it all up, please."

1060
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:44,971
-Oh!
-Nice.

1061
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:46,389
-It's Sang-yeon.
-It is.

1062
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:48,892
The winning bidder for Round 9 is…

1063
00:53:52,145 --> 00:53:53,480
Choi Hyun-joon.

1064
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:55,190
Here is your victory token.

1065
00:53:57,943 --> 00:53:59,653
Gosh, it was Hyun-joon.

1066
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:00,570
It was Hyun-joon?

1067
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:01,905
Good job.

1068
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:03,823
Nice. 2 minutes 30 seconds.

1069
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:05,200
It's not easy.

1070
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:06,326
It's definitely not.

1071
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:07,869
Nor should it be.

1072
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:10,205
We have to do it properly.

1073
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:15,001
ROUND 9
CHOI HYUN-JOON: WIN

1074
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:16,461
Round 10 will now begin.

1075
00:54:16,544 --> 00:54:18,672
Players, please stand by
while pushing your button.

1076
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:20,715
It's not easy for a game like this

1077
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:22,926
to have an even number of wins like that.

1078
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:24,886
They might have actually schemed.

1079
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:26,680
Then, what about Justin?

1080
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:28,139
Exactly, Justin…

1081
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:32,185
But if there's an alliance,
there's no way for Sang-yeon to win.

1082
00:54:37,899 --> 00:54:40,068
Everyone's hands are numb now.

1083
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:42,404
Choi Hyun-joon, please press the button.

1084
00:54:42,487 --> 00:54:44,072
-Seriously?
-My hand went numb.

1085
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:45,156
You too, right?

1086
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,283
My nerves are just…

1087
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:47,784
I was pushing down as well.

1088
00:54:59,504 --> 00:55:01,965
It would be so great
if you win under 30 seconds.

1089
00:55:04,175 --> 00:55:05,885
You lift your cramping hand,

1090
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,595
and it's over after 30 seconds.

1091
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:10,515
-That would be sweet.
-It would be.

1092
00:55:19,774 --> 00:55:23,069
Got to go over two minutes.

1093
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:24,529
It might be shorter now.

1094
00:55:24,612 --> 00:55:27,157
-Do you think so?
-Since they'll start getting nervous now.

1095
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:38,376
-Crazy.
-58 seconds? Justin?

1096
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:41,004
The winning bidder for Round 10 is…

1097
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:47,218
Son Eun-yu.

1098
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:48,845
Here is your victory token.

1099
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:51,181
-It was short.
-Good job.

1100
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:52,640
I was shaking so much.

1101
00:55:57,687 --> 00:55:59,022
-Well played.
-Only 58 seconds?

1102
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:01,316
Good job.

1103
00:56:01,399 --> 00:56:03,902
I thought a little psychological warfare
was necessary.

1104
00:56:03,985 --> 00:56:06,821
I felt those without wins
would start hoarding time

1105
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:08,615
and make the later rounds go longer.

1106
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:12,369
I figured I'd press down
for the shortest amount of time possible.

1107
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:15,789
I was okay with losing and let go
at a somewhat questionable point.

1108
00:56:16,414 --> 00:56:19,501
ROUND 10
SON EUN-YU: WIN

1109
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:25,006
That was a mistake.

1110
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:28,301
I was more nervous than I expected,
and I was shaking.

1111
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:31,179
We had to press down
for five seconds at the start…

1112
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:34,057
-Choi Hyun-joon, please press the button.
-Oh.

1113
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:35,433
It's become numb.

1114
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:36,726
You too, right?

1115
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:40,271
I told myself I had to press down firmly.

1116
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:42,357
Before I knew it, 20 seconds had passed.

1117
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,818
I was so startled
and as I was lifting up my hand,

1118
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:48,154
I thought to myself,
"I might end up going home this time."

1119
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:50,865
Because I wasted 20 second
for no good reason.

1120
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:58,248
I'm feeling anxious for Sang-yeon.

1121
00:56:58,331 --> 00:57:00,500
Sang-yeon, one won't be enough.

1122
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:05,547
Round 11 will now begin.

1123
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:08,341
Players, please stand by
while pushing your button.

1124
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:20,645
I don't think anyone has much time left.

1125
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:23,523
I do think
everyone went too hard at the beginning.

1126
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:27,777
It might be hard to go past a minute now.

1127
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:32,031
How much has everyone used?
Three, two, two, two, and one…

1128
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:33,700
I have no idea about Justin.

1129
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:39,247
Justin might get this one.

1130
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:40,623
He might.

1131
00:57:50,675 --> 00:57:52,385
"1 minute 44 seconds."

1132
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:53,553
Then, is it Se-dol?

1133
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:54,762
It might be.

1134
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:56,389
The winning bidder for Round 11 is

1135
00:57:57,265 --> 00:57:58,475
Kim Ha-rin.

1136
00:57:59,058 --> 00:58:00,477
Here is your victory token.

1137
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:08,109
Wait, the order of winning is
like ping-pong.

1138
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:12,238
I think Ha-rin and Eun-yu
have a good strategy going.

1139
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:14,157
I think they might be working together.

1140
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,241
They probably did.

1141
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:17,702
At the very least,
they've shared their strategies.

1142
00:58:17,785 --> 00:58:20,788
Because every time Eun-yu wins,
Ha-rin wins the very next round.

1143
00:58:20,872 --> 00:58:23,374
Hyun-joon too.
If he wins next, it confirms it.

1144
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:26,085
ROUND 11
KIM HA-RIN: WIN

1145
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:28,213
Round 12 will now begin.

1146
00:58:28,296 --> 00:58:30,882
Players, please stand by
while pushing your button.

1147
00:58:52,153 --> 00:58:53,071
Justin.

1148
00:58:53,571 --> 00:58:56,616
Why are you smiling at me so happily?

1149
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:58,076
You're making me nervous.

1150
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:00,828
When it comes to Justin,

1151
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:03,331
I have no idea what he's thinking.

1152
00:59:03,414 --> 00:59:07,752
He kept the same expression,
just looking at me and smiling.

1153
00:59:07,835 --> 00:59:10,505
I couldn't tell if he was
happy about something

1154
00:59:10,588 --> 00:59:13,550
or if that was his poker face.

1155
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,513
You have a lot of time?

1156
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:22,809
Have no idea?

1157
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:05,560
This time, we're going past two minutes.

1158
01:00:05,643 --> 01:00:07,687
Someone is determined to win.

1159
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:09,022
It's a two-minute round.

1160
01:00:18,823 --> 01:00:19,741
It's mine.

1161
01:00:21,826 --> 01:00:24,120
The winning bidder for Round 12 is
Lee Se-dol.

1162
01:00:24,203 --> 01:00:26,039
-Here is your victory token.
-I misjudged it.

1163
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:30,126
I thought I saw him press down hard.
But then, I saw him relax later.

1164
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:32,170
Honestly. I'm serious.

1165
01:00:32,253 --> 01:00:33,880
Can you see it in his triceps?

1166
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:37,216
I thought I could notice a difference
between pressing and not pressing.

1167
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:40,136
You can see it in the players
right next to you.

1168
01:00:40,219 --> 01:00:42,513
He looked a little different

1169
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:46,809
when he was actually using his arm
and when he was faking it.

1170
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:50,647
It was especially obvious with Hyun-joon
because he was wearing short sleeves.

1171
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:52,899
When Se-dol got another one,

1172
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:56,819
I never thought
that he would go for so long.

1173
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:58,404
I couldn't hide my feelings.

1174
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:01,282
All I could think about
was winning the next one.

1175
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:03,409
You're not supposed to notice such things.

1176
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:05,078
Did I look at it like this?

1177
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:08,289
TIME LEFT

1178
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:10,249
Hyun-joon is looking anxious too.

1179
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:11,793
If Sang-yeon just gets one more,

1180
01:01:12,293 --> 01:01:13,378
Hyun-joon is wary.

1181
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:15,421
Round 13 will now begin.

1182
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:18,383
Players, please stand by
while pushing your button.

1183
01:01:20,718 --> 01:01:23,346
-Choi Hyun-joon, please press the button.
-Right. Okay.

1184
01:01:38,569 --> 01:01:39,987
Guess how much I have left.

1185
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:47,829
What's with Sang-yeon's wry smile?
A bit bittersweet.

1186
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:55,837
I tried really hard to try to read
Sang-yeon and Se-dol's expressions.

1187
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:59,507
At first, I trusted their arms more
and tried to read them

1188
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:00,925
with expressions in mind.

1189
01:02:01,008 --> 01:02:04,262
There were times in the middle
when I thought I had read them right…

1190
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:23,114
It's hard to divide up your time.

1191
01:02:23,197 --> 01:02:25,366
You have to think
about the last few rounds.

1192
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:26,826
Since it's Round 13…

1193
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:28,536
Someone is hanging in there.

1194
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:40,381
"2 minutes 7 seconds."

1195
01:02:40,465 --> 01:02:41,758
Please, Sang-yeon.

1196
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:44,093
The winning bidder for Round 13 is

1197
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:45,470
Lee Se-dol.

1198
01:02:45,553 --> 01:02:46,846
Se-dol is going for it.

1199
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:48,431
Wow, that's crazy.

1200
01:02:48,514 --> 01:02:50,475
Amazingly, he just used up 8 minutes.

1201
01:02:50,558 --> 01:02:52,310
He wasted no time earlier.

1202
01:02:52,393 --> 01:02:54,020
Maybe he won every round he played?

1203
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:55,480
You might be right.

1204
01:02:56,522 --> 01:02:58,649
I lifted my hand with certainty.

1205
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:00,943
I knew I'd won. Both times.

1206
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:02,320
-Really?
-Yes.

1207
01:03:02,403 --> 01:03:03,946
"I lifted because I knew." Wow.

1208
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:05,448
He's so amazing.

1209
01:03:05,531 --> 01:03:09,660
Imagine all the psychological warfare
he experienced in Go…

1210
01:03:09,744 --> 01:03:12,038
In Go, everything is in the open.

1211
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:16,167
It's just hard to deduce
even when everything is in the open.

1212
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:19,045
Go is very open, but this isn't.

1213
01:03:19,128 --> 01:03:21,172
However, just like Go,

1214
01:03:21,255 --> 01:03:24,133
there are ways to increase
your probability of winning.

1215
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:27,053
ROUND 13
LEE SE-DOL: WIN

1216
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:28,763
Round 14 will now begin.

1217
01:03:42,109 --> 01:03:44,737
One of those three
might put it all on the line now.

1218
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:46,948
-It's a fight for first.
-I think Ha-rin might go for it.

1219
01:03:47,031 --> 01:03:49,075
I don't think she has enough time left.

1220
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:50,785
Ha-rin and Eun-yu
can't have much time left.

1221
01:03:50,868 --> 01:03:51,786
They don't.

1222
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:16,561
Ha-rin won three times by
using 6 minutes and 20 seconds.

1223
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:19,230
-She could have over three minutes left.
-That's not likely.

1224
01:04:19,313 --> 01:04:20,773
-She would've used more.
-Of course.

1225
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:22,024
Then, Ha-rin has nothing.

1226
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:29,323
Since Se-dol has won four,
I think first place is settled.

1227
01:04:29,407 --> 01:04:32,743
I think Se-dol knows
they're out of time and he's saving his.

1228
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:34,620
-Reserve time…
-He can just save his.

1229
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:36,873
Then, he'll finish first for sure.

1230
01:04:43,462 --> 01:04:44,797
The winning bidder for Round 14 is

1231
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:48,050
Kim Ha-rin.

1232
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:52,221
Ha-rin did have some time left.

1233
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:53,139
Her will to win.

1234
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:54,515
We should have her join us.

1235
01:04:55,099 --> 01:04:56,851
Here is your victory token.

1236
01:04:59,645 --> 01:05:01,981
ROUND 14
KIM HA-RIN: WIN

1237
01:05:08,529 --> 01:05:10,406
-Didn't I tell you? Ha-rin is scary.
-She's good.

1238
01:05:10,489 --> 01:05:11,866
It's not that.

1239
01:05:11,949 --> 01:05:12,992
Sang-yeon?

1240
01:05:13,492 --> 01:05:16,078
We have to hope that Justin
used up a minute every round.

1241
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:18,164
Round 15 will now begin.

1242
01:05:42,688 --> 01:05:45,066
I assumed Hyun-joon
probably didn't have much time left.

1243
01:05:45,149 --> 01:05:49,904
To be honest, I thought it was
a fight between me and Justin.

1244
01:05:49,987 --> 01:05:52,156
If Sang-yeon can win this,
then he'll be safe.

1245
01:05:52,239 --> 01:05:55,785
-Sang-yeon must have allotted his time.
-He must have after careful calculations.

1246
01:05:55,868 --> 01:05:58,037
Maybe it's five lots of two minutes each?

1247
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:01,040
He used 2 minutes and 10 seconds
in Round 4.

1248
01:06:15,888 --> 01:06:16,931
This is going too long.

1249
01:06:17,014 --> 01:06:19,809
Someone's really going for it.
Charging straight ahead.

1250
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:34,115
The winning bidder for Round 15 is

1251
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:36,492
Justin Min.

1252
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:41,706
Hey, we were right.
This is Justin's strategy.

1253
01:06:41,789 --> 01:06:42,665
I knew it.

1254
01:06:42,748 --> 01:06:45,167
-Here is your victory token.
-I thought you might.

1255
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:48,212
That's the kind of guy he is.
Save things for the second half.

1256
01:06:48,295 --> 01:06:49,547
Poor Sang-yeon…

1257
01:06:57,138 --> 01:06:59,306
I intentionally skipped Round 15.

1258
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:02,768
I figured dividing my remaining time
over 15 and 18 would be meaningless.

1259
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:06,814
I'd calculated that I probably had
about a minute left at that stage.

1260
01:07:07,314 --> 01:07:09,025
Round 16 will now begin.

1261
01:07:09,567 --> 01:07:11,944
Players, please stand by
while pushing your button.

1262
01:07:21,328 --> 01:07:23,748
The fourth victory token wasn't important.

1263
01:07:23,831 --> 01:07:26,333
The Piece goes to the one
with the most time left after.

1264
01:07:26,417 --> 01:07:30,921
Since it wasn't
a matter of being eliminated,

1265
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:35,843
I thought I'd try to win as quickly
as possible and save my reserve time.

1266
01:07:35,926 --> 01:07:37,178
What round is this?

1267
01:07:37,678 --> 01:07:38,846
It's Round 16.

1268
01:07:38,929 --> 01:07:39,847
Thank you.

1269
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:43,601
They must be so anxious
with the clock just ticking away.

1270
01:07:43,684 --> 01:07:45,561
"Should I lift it now? Now? Now?"

1271
01:08:04,622 --> 01:08:05,748
The vibe feels weird.

1272
01:08:05,831 --> 01:08:07,958
We're back to 2 minutes and 30 seconds.

1273
01:08:08,042 --> 01:08:10,669
Wow, it's still going.
It just keeps going.

1274
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:21,722
That was long.

1275
01:08:21,806 --> 01:08:22,640
It certainly was.

1276
01:08:22,723 --> 01:08:24,141
The winning bidder for Round 16 is…

1277
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:27,978
Justin Min.

1278
01:08:28,062 --> 01:08:29,355
Here is your victory token.

1279
01:08:31,148 --> 01:08:33,359
-Didn't I call it? Wasn't I exactly right?
-Crazy.

1280
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:34,902
Justin is really just amazing.

1281
01:08:34,985 --> 01:08:37,029
He might look inscrutable, but he's not.

1282
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:38,572
You can see he's in battle mode.

1283
01:08:38,656 --> 01:08:40,991
Right, the look in his eyes has changed.

1284
01:08:41,075 --> 01:08:41,909
I thought as much.

1285
01:08:41,992 --> 01:08:43,702
You saved that much time?

1286
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:45,246
I didn't know.

1287
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:51,460
ROUND 16
JUSTIN MIN: WIN

1288
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:53,170
Round 17 will now begin.

1289
01:08:53,254 --> 01:08:56,132
Players, please stand by
while pushing your button.

1290
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:22,700
Don't you think
Justin will go for three minutes here?

1291
01:09:22,783 --> 01:09:25,327
Or since he just won
in 2 minutes 20 seconds,

1292
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:27,830
maybe he's thinking
he can cut it down to 2 minutes.

1293
01:09:27,913 --> 01:09:29,540
He has two and is not in last place.

1294
01:09:36,338 --> 01:09:37,506
He's still pressing.

1295
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:41,302
You will keep going on?

1296
01:09:41,802 --> 01:09:43,470
Maybe Justin is the only one?

1297
01:09:46,390 --> 01:09:47,600
I think he might be.

1298
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:49,560
Who knows?

1299
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:51,896
No one knows.

1300
01:10:00,404 --> 01:10:01,530
Justin, is it you?

1301
01:10:03,365 --> 01:10:04,867
The winning bidder for Round 17 is…

1302
01:10:09,747 --> 01:10:10,748
Kim Ha-rin.

1303
01:10:14,001 --> 01:10:15,711
What the heck?

1304
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:17,171
She had 2 minutes?

1305
01:10:18,088 --> 01:10:19,465
Here is your victory token.

1306
01:10:20,174 --> 01:10:21,884
-Well played.
-She's good.

1307
01:10:21,967 --> 01:10:23,219
Thank you.

1308
01:10:23,302 --> 01:10:24,762
Impossible.

1309
01:10:24,845 --> 01:10:27,097
I think she got
every single one she went for.

1310
01:10:27,181 --> 01:10:30,267
Wow, she won five.
That's honestly pretty amazing.

1311
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:33,354
My poor shoulders.

1312
01:10:36,982 --> 01:10:39,109
What happens if you use up all your time?

1313
01:10:39,193 --> 01:10:40,653
It just starts vibrating.

1314
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:45,366
Do you think
Justin just took a hit from Ha-rin?

1315
01:10:45,449 --> 01:10:46,784
I think he might have.

1316
01:10:46,867 --> 01:10:48,786
I think he would have stopped
at 2 minutes.

1317
01:10:48,869 --> 01:10:50,496
He thought he was the only one left.

1318
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:52,164
He assumed she had nothing left.

1319
01:10:53,374 --> 01:10:55,793
He must be flustered
after investing and not winning.

1320
01:10:57,586 --> 01:10:59,463
Round 18 will now begin.

1321
01:10:59,546 --> 01:11:01,006
Round 18?

1322
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:03,926
There are two victory tokens remaining.

1323
01:11:04,009 --> 01:11:08,013
One of the bottom three
will definitely be eliminated.

1324
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:10,557
If there is a tie
for victory tokens at the end,

1325
01:11:10,641 --> 01:11:13,102
the ranking will be determined
by the reserve times.

1326
01:11:13,185 --> 01:11:16,230
It is time for the players
to manage their time carefully.

1327
01:11:21,568 --> 01:11:23,779
Players, please stand by
while pushing your button.

1328
01:11:23,862 --> 01:11:27,658
I was going to leave it up to the heavens
and use up a whole minute if need be.

1329
01:11:27,741 --> 01:11:30,286
It wasn't as if there was
a need for me to stop.

1330
01:11:30,369 --> 01:11:33,205
I figured I'd use it up
and see if I still had a chance to win.

1331
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:00,399
Sang-yeon, please.

1332
01:12:01,483 --> 01:12:02,818
Let's go. Just once.

1333
01:12:26,925 --> 01:12:28,552
-What the heck?
-How many seconds?

1334
01:12:28,635 --> 01:12:29,845
"1 minute 13 seconds."

1335
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:33,057
The winning bidder for Round 18 is
Choi Hyun-joon.

1336
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:34,767
Here is your victory token.

1337
01:12:36,143 --> 01:12:39,271
Hyun-joon pulled off a great win.
Well done.

1338
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:41,982
This is fun.

1339
01:12:42,566 --> 01:12:45,611
ROUND 18
CHOI HYUN-JOON: WIN

1340
01:12:45,694 --> 01:12:47,821
The 19th and final round will now begin.

1341
01:12:52,284 --> 01:12:53,744
This is the last round.

1342
01:12:54,244 --> 01:12:57,247
Winner takes all.
Sang-yeon has to win, no matter what.

1343
01:12:57,331 --> 01:12:59,166
He has to keep pressing until the end.

1344
01:13:15,974 --> 01:13:16,975
Sang-yeon.

1345
01:13:29,905 --> 01:13:31,156
It's so quiet.

1346
01:13:50,175 --> 01:13:52,261
Someone still has two minutes
in the last round?

1347
01:13:52,344 --> 01:13:54,221
How is that even possible?

1348
01:13:54,304 --> 01:13:56,557
I suppose they might have not played.

1349
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:59,518
Maybe they're securing one for sure.

1350
01:14:03,605 --> 01:14:05,816
Playing it must feel different.

1351
01:14:12,030 --> 01:14:15,033
Someone's using like 30%
of their total time in one round.

1352
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:16,201
What is going on?

1353
01:14:16,285 --> 01:14:17,661
It'll soon be three minutes.

1354
01:14:27,546 --> 01:14:29,590
-Perhaps more than four minutes?
-They saved up a lot.

1355
01:14:30,174 --> 01:14:31,592
At 3 minutes and 30 seconds?

1356
01:14:35,095 --> 01:14:36,180
Is this a bug?

1357
01:14:37,097 --> 01:14:38,807
It's going to four minutes.

1358
01:14:43,312 --> 01:14:45,439
How is this even possible?

1359
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:49,318
Maybe they didn't--

1360
01:14:49,401 --> 01:14:50,861
4 minutes 9 seconds?

1361
01:14:50,944 --> 01:14:52,571
The winning bidder for Round 19 is…

1362
01:14:57,910 --> 01:14:59,036
Justin Min.

1363
01:14:59,119 --> 01:15:00,579
Here is your victory token.

1364
01:15:01,121 --> 01:15:03,499
Wow. What the heck, Justin?

1365
01:15:18,472 --> 01:15:22,184
I'm unsure about Justin
because his time hasn't been revealed yet.

1366
01:15:22,267 --> 01:15:24,645
I was planning to save my time

1367
01:15:24,728 --> 01:15:27,773
for the later rounds right from the start.

1368
01:15:27,856 --> 01:15:30,442
I guess he got two wins
and then waited for the last round.

1369
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:32,736
That concludes Time Auction.

1370
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:36,031
The player who has
the most victory tokens,

1371
01:15:36,114 --> 01:15:39,243
Kim Ha-rin will be rewarded
with one Piece.

1372
01:15:39,326 --> 01:15:41,870
The player who has
the least victory tokens,

1373
01:15:41,954 --> 01:15:46,625
Park Sang-yeon becomes the third player
eliminated from The Devil's Plan.

1374
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:48,752
-Sorry.
-Congratulations.

1375
01:15:48,835 --> 01:15:50,504
Sang-yeon, well played.

1376
01:15:50,587 --> 01:15:51,922
During the prison match,

1377
01:15:52,005 --> 01:15:53,715
I didn't get anything right.

1378
01:15:53,799 --> 01:15:57,761
I adjusted my time usage based on
when I assumed the other players

1379
01:15:57,844 --> 01:16:00,305
were pressing and not pressing.

1380
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:03,350
In the early rounds,
I wasted 2 or 3 minutes each,

1381
01:16:03,433 --> 01:16:05,227
which meant I could never recover.

1382
01:16:05,310 --> 01:16:08,939
Park Sang-yeon,
please leave this place immediately.

1383
01:16:09,022 --> 01:16:10,107
Thank you.

1384
01:16:10,190 --> 01:16:11,400
Well played.

1385
01:16:12,818 --> 01:16:14,069
See you on the outside.

1386
01:16:14,611 --> 01:16:16,405
-Good luck.
-Cheer up.

1387
01:16:20,742 --> 01:16:22,869
Before the games started,

1388
01:16:22,953 --> 01:16:24,913
I said I was 95% certain of my win.

1389
01:16:24,997 --> 01:16:28,000
My groundless self-confidence led
to a lot of statements like that.

1390
01:16:28,083 --> 01:16:31,962
I was most disappointed that I never got
to play the way I wanted to.

1391
01:16:32,045 --> 01:16:34,631
But still, I gave it my all.

1392
01:16:34,715 --> 01:16:38,594
I learned there were a lot
of extraordinary people in the world.

1393
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:41,221
This is Park Sang-yeon signing out.

1394
01:16:41,305 --> 01:16:42,347
Thank you.

1395
01:16:48,937 --> 01:16:50,397
This sucks.

1396
01:16:54,234 --> 01:16:56,194
This is really scary.

1397
01:16:56,278 --> 01:16:58,155
This concludes the prison match.

1398
01:16:58,238 --> 01:17:00,991
All players, please return
to the living area.

1399
01:17:06,163 --> 01:17:07,247
No.

1400
01:17:07,331 --> 01:17:08,540
I think you did.

1401
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:09,541
Honestly, we didn't.

1402
01:17:10,125 --> 01:17:11,209
I think you did.

1403
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:13,712
I never gave them that idea.

1404
01:17:13,795 --> 01:17:15,297
I'll remember this.

1405
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:20,135
It feels like I played the game
by myself the whole day.

1406
01:17:20,218 --> 01:17:23,138
I was betrayed by the team.

1407
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:29,144
No, it wasn't like that.
Honestly, it wasn't.

1408
01:17:29,227 --> 01:17:31,897
I swear. Because…

1409
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:33,857
No, I mean, I know.

1410
01:17:34,816 --> 01:17:37,027
I never agreed to it.
That's not what happened.

1411
01:17:37,110 --> 01:17:38,654
This is the sequence of events.

1412
01:17:38,737 --> 01:17:42,115
Sang-yeon gave a lot of info,
so I was thinking we should play solo.

1413
01:17:42,199 --> 01:17:43,867
That's what I was thinking to myself.

1414
01:17:43,950 --> 01:17:46,078
But it's like you took turns winning.

1415
01:17:46,161 --> 01:17:48,413
The other two were
already planning to do that,

1416
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:50,582
and they proposed I join them.

1417
01:17:52,584 --> 01:17:53,418
So…

1418
01:17:55,128 --> 01:17:58,256
You betrayed me
during the main match as well.

1419
01:17:58,340 --> 01:17:59,466
Who betrayed you?

1420
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:01,843
Me and Ha-rin?

1421
01:18:02,552 --> 01:18:03,762
We betrayed our team?

1422
01:18:04,554 --> 01:18:06,515
-When?
-During today's main match.

1423
01:18:07,015 --> 01:18:08,600
We were on the same team
in the main match.

1424
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:15,273
What? What did you say?

1425
01:18:15,357 --> 01:18:17,859
Justin is saying we were working
with the other team,

1426
01:18:17,943 --> 01:18:19,820
but we came back because we were losing.

1427
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:21,029
That's nonsense.

1428
01:18:21,113 --> 01:18:23,365
It wasn't like that.
It was just the two of us.

1429
01:18:25,742 --> 01:18:29,538
-That's not what happened.
-How can you possibly take it like that?

1430
01:18:30,122 --> 01:18:30,956
Green.

1431
01:18:31,039 --> 01:18:35,585
Please select a green player
and move their counter one square…

1432
01:18:35,669 --> 01:18:39,089
If I help someone finish first,
I want to be rewarded with a Piece.

1433
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:47,681
Between you and Ji-yeong?

1434
01:18:49,975 --> 01:18:53,603
But, if I had pushed you forward,
would it have amounted to anything?

1435
01:18:53,687 --> 01:18:54,813
Because I was trying to--

1436
01:18:57,107 --> 01:18:59,317
Wasn't that our agreement?

1437
01:18:59,401 --> 01:19:04,239
At the time, I thought that Ji-yeong
was in a similar position to us

1438
01:19:04,322 --> 01:19:06,658
and if we're playing together
in this place,

1439
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:08,744
I thought there was a better chance

1440
01:19:08,827 --> 01:19:11,121
of striking a deal
with Ji-yeong than Justin.

1441
01:19:11,204 --> 01:19:12,914
That was our agreement.

1442
01:19:12,998 --> 01:19:13,957
Right.

1443
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:17,586
But at that stage,
we still thought Ji-yeong was one of us.

1444
01:19:18,295 --> 01:19:20,881
I can see that.
That's why I asked for your understanding.

1445
01:19:20,964 --> 01:19:22,132
That Piece was important to me.

1446
01:19:22,215 --> 01:19:24,384
Right, what can I say?

1447
01:19:24,468 --> 01:19:26,887
I thought he might think that
during the prison match,

1448
01:19:26,970 --> 01:19:29,931
but it turns out he already started
during the main match.

1449
01:19:30,015 --> 01:19:32,142
I've lost Justin's trust.

1450
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:35,604
No, but I think he's right.

1451
01:19:35,687 --> 01:19:37,397
-Why?
-The thing is…

1452
01:19:37,481 --> 01:19:39,858
When I had a choice
between Ji-yeong and Justin,

1453
01:19:39,941 --> 01:19:41,359
I went and asked Ji-yeong.

1454
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:44,029
But that was because you thought
she was one of us.

1455
01:19:44,112 --> 01:19:45,322
I did in the early stages.

1456
01:19:45,405 --> 01:19:46,656
But she turned out to be…

1457
01:19:53,371 --> 01:19:55,081
But I chose him because…

1458
01:19:55,165 --> 01:19:58,168
On the surface,
I'm going to look like I'm helping 7high.

1459
01:19:58,251 --> 01:20:00,253
Please move 7high forward one square.

1460
01:20:01,963 --> 01:20:04,257
We talked about that in advance
and agreed on it.

1461
01:20:04,341 --> 01:20:06,426
Hold on.
Let's say that's the case for Eun-yu.

1462
01:20:06,510 --> 01:20:07,928
But why am I a betrayer?

1463
01:20:09,596 --> 01:20:11,431
Because we were right next
to each other in 8 and 10.

1464
01:20:11,515 --> 01:20:13,058
That's why I pushed her.

1465
01:20:13,141 --> 01:20:16,061
I just tried to be the first winner.

1466
01:20:16,144 --> 01:20:17,604
Only me, okay?

1467
01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:22,734
Not playing with the other team.

1468
01:20:22,818 --> 01:20:25,445
You didn't see? Other team killed me.

1469
01:20:25,529 --> 01:20:30,742
For me, my whole day was full of betrayal.

1470
01:20:31,326 --> 01:20:33,328
No, what are you talking about?

1471
01:20:33,411 --> 01:20:37,582
I mean, all I did was make
a run for it and get killed,

1472
01:20:37,666 --> 01:20:42,337
so how could he possibly think
of me as a betrayer?

1473
01:20:47,843 --> 01:20:49,761
Why do I feel like I'm in shock?

1474
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:52,305
I'm really shocked. Watching them play.

1475
01:20:52,389 --> 01:20:54,724
Sang-yeon never got
a chance to do anything.

1476
01:20:54,808 --> 01:20:59,479
You could say people are starting
to reveal their true colors.

1477
01:20:59,563 --> 01:21:01,189
I could sense the bloodlust.

1478
01:21:01,273 --> 01:21:05,443
The glint in their eyes, the smug smiles,

1479
01:21:05,527 --> 01:21:08,613
and the lust they had for one more Piece.

1480
01:21:08,697 --> 01:21:09,698
And in the middle

1481
01:21:09,781 --> 01:21:13,535
was Sang-yeon
with everything written on his face.

1482
01:21:13,618 --> 01:21:16,079
Watching him grow more panicked

1483
01:21:16,162 --> 01:21:18,415
was truly a frightening sight.

1484
01:21:18,498 --> 01:21:19,916
They must have schemed that.

1485
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,128
That's a surefire way to win.
I would have done that if it were me.

1486
01:21:23,211 --> 01:21:24,588
So, another alliance win?

1487
01:21:24,671 --> 01:21:27,132
I think so. He definitely became a target.

1488
01:21:27,966 --> 01:21:30,427
It wouldn't surprise me
if there was a revolt.

1489
01:21:30,510 --> 01:21:31,469
There will be one.

1490
01:21:31,553 --> 01:21:34,806
Tomorrow, they're probably going to come
at us with tremendous momentum.

1491
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:37,517
While we were dissecting the game,

1492
01:21:37,601 --> 01:21:40,604
it looked like Hyun-gyu
was practicing hard and researching.

1493
01:21:40,687 --> 01:21:42,230
I've memorized all of it.

1494
01:21:42,314 --> 01:21:43,523
Have you taken a shower?

1495
01:21:43,607 --> 01:21:45,317
-I'm just going to go for it.
-Now?

1496
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:46,526
One last test.

1497
01:21:48,445 --> 01:21:49,571
If he's that good…

1498
01:21:50,572 --> 01:21:52,490
-He's got it.
-Perfect. The end.

1499
01:21:52,991 --> 01:21:53,867
Okay.

1500
01:21:54,367 --> 01:21:56,578
Shall we go? Go while it's still fresh.

1501
01:21:56,661 --> 01:21:57,746
We'll see you off.

1502
01:21:57,829 --> 01:21:58,830
Yeah. Hyun-gyu.

1503
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:00,290
Your trip…

1504
01:22:06,713 --> 01:22:09,257
Wow, Hyun-gyu. You've got to make it back.

1505
01:22:10,258 --> 01:22:13,011
-Like you're really going somewhere…
-I want to take a pic.

1506
01:22:16,806 --> 01:22:18,516
-Amazing.
-The door just shut.

1507
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:20,644
-He didn't even press the bell.
-It didn't close before.

1508
01:22:24,105 --> 01:22:26,524
I studied really hard right until the end,

1509
01:22:26,608 --> 01:22:29,277
and I was confident about the past
that brought me here.

1510
01:22:31,154 --> 01:22:33,198
WELCOME TO THE HIDDEN STAGE

1511
01:22:34,199 --> 01:22:35,283
IF YOU SUCCEED IN THE HIDDEN STAGE,

1512
01:22:35,367 --> 01:22:36,701
YOU'LL BE IN A BETTER POSITION
TO REACH THE FINALE

1513
01:22:36,785 --> 01:22:38,119
YOU WILL NOT BE ELIMINATED
EVEN IF YOU FAIL

1514
01:23:15,115 --> 01:23:16,157
Greetings.

1515
01:23:19,619 --> 01:23:22,664
Welcome to the hidden stage.

1516
01:25:18,696 --> 01:25:19,948
I will move to 124.

1517
01:25:20,031 --> 01:25:21,658
Moving to 124.

1518
01:25:23,993 --> 01:25:25,662
Please change your counter color.

1519
01:25:25,745 --> 01:25:27,330
-Then, I'll do this.
-Is this correct?

1520
01:25:27,413 --> 01:25:28,414
It is.

1521
01:25:30,416 --> 01:25:34,712
At this point, Park Sang-yeon missed
a huge opportunity to win.

1522
01:25:35,213 --> 01:25:37,632
I had the opportunity to get the win.

1523
01:25:38,633 --> 01:25:42,428
Park Sang-yeon moved forward to try
to reach the finishing line,

1524
01:25:42,512 --> 01:25:45,348
but what if he had gone back?

1525
01:25:46,266 --> 01:25:48,643
Of course, he would have had
to strategically place

1526
01:25:48,726 --> 01:25:51,521
his counter before changing to yellow.

1527
01:25:51,604 --> 01:25:55,316
When moving back to 105,
he needed to have red face up

1528
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:58,319
so that he could change it back to yellow.

1529
01:25:59,654 --> 01:26:03,366
After switching to yellow,
he would need to place his counter

1530
01:26:03,449 --> 01:26:05,702
so that blue or purple would face up

1531
01:26:05,785 --> 01:26:07,662
when he moved back
to 123 on his next move.

1532
01:26:07,745 --> 01:26:11,583
If he had moved back and forth
between 105 and 123,

1533
01:26:11,666 --> 01:26:14,335
he would've had the chance
to move all other players' counters

1534
01:26:14,419 --> 01:26:17,755
without ever giving them a turn.

1535
01:26:17,839 --> 01:26:19,841
He could've done this all day.

1536
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:23,887
He could have made
another player win, exiled them,

1537
01:26:23,970 --> 01:26:26,181
or even eliminated them.

1538
01:26:27,307 --> 01:26:30,935
However, he would not have been able
to make it to the finish line himself.

1539
01:26:31,519 --> 01:26:33,229
In addition to this, during testing,

1540
01:26:33,313 --> 01:26:35,815
we discovered
other interesting winning strategies.

1541
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:39,235
Join us in continuing
this discovery expedition.

1542
