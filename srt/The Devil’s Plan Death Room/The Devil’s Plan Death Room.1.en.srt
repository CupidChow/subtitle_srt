1
00:00:06,214 --> 00:00:10,760
What do you think about randomly
giving out the Pieces won in this match?

2
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:12,345
Or give them to the players in prison.

3
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:13,680
He was the fanatic.

4
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:14,723
We were all wrong.

5
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:22,689
He's asking to be killed.
We shouldn't kill him.

6
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:24,065
Can you betray Seok-jin?

7
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:26,818
Honestly?
Stand with the underdogs, my foot.

8
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:31,197
This is The Devil's Plan?
More like Moocher's Plan.

9
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:33,825
No way! This opens?

10
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:40,165
The final winner
of The Devil's Plan is Ha Seok-jin.

11
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:42,459
Congratulations.

12
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:47,756
You have been invited to The Devil's Plan.

13
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:51,676
You are all players here
on the same standing

14
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,721
competing against one another,

15
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:56,848
following the same set of given rules.

16
00:00:57,432 --> 00:01:00,393
We ask only one thing of you.

17
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:02,520
Play only for victory.

18
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,148
A genius strategy to dominate the board.

19
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,358
It's a war now. There's no mercy anymore.

20
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:10,862
Keen insight to ferret out hidden secrets.

21
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,742
The wisdom to turn
crisis into opportunity.

22
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:23,708
Muster all your might to survive and win.

23
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:29,214
Though your victory may be stained
with deceit and betrayal,

24
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:33,760
we will gladly applaud you
and award you with the final prize.

25
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:40,391
The second ploy of The Devil’s Plan
will be completely new and more dangerous.

26
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:43,603
The most interesting
and dangerous game of your lifetime.

27
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:49,400
Will you join The Devil's Plan?

28
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:11,047
THE DEVIL'S PLAN
DEATH ROOM

29
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:21,558
Hello.

30
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:22,934
Hello, my name is Kyuhyun.

31
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:24,978
I've been a singer for 19 years,

32
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:27,772
a mainstream musical actor
and a mainstream TV personality.

33
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:28,898
It's nice to be here.

34
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,568
As a member of SUPER JUNIOR,
Kyuhyun has been active

35
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,195
as a musical actor and a TV personality.

36
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:37,657
He is an artist known for his intellect
who even won the Minister's Award

37
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,910
in a math competition
when he was in high school.

38
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,829
I'm the first one here.

39
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:47,750
The house feels
quite different from season one.

40
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,753
I know that season one was
a hit across the globe.

41
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,006
The overall set feels upgraded.

42
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:55,008
They clearly spent some money.

43
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,843
Definitely a bigger budget this time.

44
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,970
Thank you.

45
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:04,893
This has changed.

46
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:08,104
There was a massive secret
to do with the Pieces last season.

47
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:11,232
It almost looked like an old key

48
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,151
or something you match up and turn.

49
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:15,904
They've even given me
some kind of welcome tea.

50
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,037
That's so sour.

51
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:33,129
Hello, nice to see you. Hello.

52
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:36,007
We have a newscaster joining us now.

53
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,345
Hello, I'm Kang Ji-yeong,
a JTBC newscaster.

54
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:43,932
Kang Ji-yeong studied
finance at Indiana University

55
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:46,643
and successfully passed the AICPA Exam.

56
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:49,062
Currently, she is a newscaster at JTBC,

57
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:52,357
appearing in news, culture,
and variety programs.

58
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,441
KANG JI-YEONG

59
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:55,985
-Oh, there's even a gym.
-There is. Do you work out?

60
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,279
I'm a bit prone to suffering from fatigue.

61
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:02,242
I was put slightly to ease
because I've met Kyuhyun before.

62
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:04,327
Seeing you here feels different.

63
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,579
-I feel reassured already.
-Me too…

64
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:10,416
Personally, I'm looking forward
to competing with Ji-yeong,

65
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,001
but she might backstab me.

66
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,670
How old are you again?

67
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,588
I was born in 1987.

68
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,090
-Well, actually, early 1988.
-I see.

69
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,466
You were born in 1993, right?

70
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:20,927
No, I was born in 1989.
We're about the same.

71
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,179
Really? I could have sworn
you were born in 1993.

72
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,722
Really? Thank you.

73
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,688
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

74
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,356
-Hello.
-Hi.

75
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,899
My name is Choi Hyun-joon,

76
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,902
and I'm a senior at KAIST.

77
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,738
Choi Hyun-joon showed off his quirky charm

78
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:43,199
with his yo-yo skills on a variety show

79
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,910
while he was studying
Mathematical Science at KAIST.

80
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,162
Four months after signing
with a modeling agency,

81
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:49,747
he became the first Korean male model

82
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:52,458
to walk the Saint Laurent runway
making headlines.

83
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,085
CHOI HYUN-JOON

84
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:56,379
-You're a KAIST student, right?
-Yes.

85
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:59,257
-You modeled for Yves Saint Laurent?
-That's right.

86
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,175
I saw you on a TV program.

87
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,593
-Really? I see.
-Yes.

88
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,846
I wasn't sure if I was right.

89
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:06,806
My hair is shorter now.

90
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,599
You look young. Are you in your 20s?

91
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:11,144
I was born in 1999. I am 26 years old.

92
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:12,103
My goodness.

93
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:17,191
So young, definitely a different vibe.

94
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,359
Wait.

95
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,570
-Hello.
-What?

96
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:21,904
Do you know her?

97
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:23,823
You're So-hui, right?

98
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:28,369
Hello. I am Yoon So-hui.
I currently work as an actress.

99
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:31,622
Yoon So-hui graduated early
from a science high school

100
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:34,751
and studied
Biochemical Engineering at KAIST.

101
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,919
Currently, she is pursuing various roles

102
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,380
as an actor in movies,
dramas, and variety shows.

103
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:40,298
YOON SO-HUI

104
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:42,717
-Kyuhyun, what are you doing here?
-So-hui, how come you're…

105
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,386
I did think there would be
a chance you'd be here.

106
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,139
She was on my list of possible candidates,

107
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:49,432
and here she is.

108
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:50,933
So, we have two from KAIST.

109
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,977
-This is amazing. Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

110
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,395
I've heard a lot about you.

111
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,898
-Did you go to KAIST, too?
-Yes, I'm your junior.

112
00:05:56,981 --> 00:06:01,527
When I was there, someone told me
there was a model among the student body.

113
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:04,614
We filmed an episode
of Naked World History recently.

114
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:07,116
I asked if she was going
to be shooting a drama next.

115
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,994
Then, she told me
she's going to do a variety show.

116
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,288
But she was being quite vague about it.

117
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,414
I didn't say much.

118
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:14,499
She really didn't,

119
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:16,876
so I didn't pry
though I had a sneaking suspicion.

120
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:17,919
Really?

121
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:21,798
Gosh. Hello.

122
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,341
-Hello.
-Welcome.

123
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:25,259
-Nice to meet you all.
-Hello there.

124
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:26,928
My name is 7high.

125
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:31,516
7high was known
as a versatile music producer

126
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:34,477
before expanding his horizons
to the world of professional Poker.

127
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,271
He continues to shine
in various tournaments.

128
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,439
7HIGH

129
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,108
Is it something related to casinos?

130
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:43,152
I participate in Poker tournaments.

131
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,655
About four or five people
were there already.

132
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,491
I was a bit surprised
because I knew who they all were,

133
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,493
but they weren't who I was expecting.

134
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:53,079
A Poker player and two from KAIST.

135
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:54,580
Where did you go to school?

136
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,499
-I studied overseas.
-I see.

137
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:57,875
No friends here. Oh, no…

138
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:01,045
Am I the most host-like here right now?

139
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:05,133
I think I'm also giving off
that cohost vibe.

140
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,510
-It looks like this is your turf.
-Really?

141
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,804
-The next person is here already.
-Hello.

142
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:12,306
-Hello.
-Hello.

143
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:17,603
Hello. My name is Lee Seung-hyun
studying economics at Korea University.

144
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,189
In 2022, Lee Seung-hyun decided
to take a year off

145
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,525
from her studies at Korea University

146
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:27,405
to compete in the Miss Korea pageant
where she was crowned as the winner.

147
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:31,159
Simply put, she has
both beauty and brains.

148
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:35,163
My name is Lee Seung-hyun.
I'm a 26-year-old college student.

149
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,789
-Which one?
-Sorry?

150
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,040
Which school?

151
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,126
I'm currently attending Korea University.

152
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:42,170
Why would you be ashamed of that?

153
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:45,882
-She wasn't. Don't embarrass her.
-Oh, she wasn't?

154
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:47,967
Let's sit down.

155
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:52,847
-Hello.
-Hello there.

156
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,557
-Hello.
-My goodness.

157
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,350
Hello, my name is Jeong Hyun-gyu.

158
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:59,270
I'm currently studying physical education
at Seoul National University,

159
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:00,313
and I'm 26 years old.

160
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:04,734
Jeong Hyun-gyu found popularity
after appearing on a famous dating show.

161
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,819
He is currently
attending Seoul National University.

162
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,404
He took the Mensa Korea IQ test

163
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,741
and got the maximum possible score of 156.

164
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:12,825
JEONG HYUN-GYU

165
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:15,328
I heard you go to a really good school.

166
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:16,454
You attend SNU, right?

167
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:19,499
Yes, I go to Seoul National University.

168
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,417
If you're 26, you were born in 1999?

169
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,002
1998.

170
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:25,004
Why do you keep going on
about age, Kyuhyun?

171
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,172
I'm sorry.

172
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:27,590
I guess you and I are a duo.

173
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,175
We're stuck with each other.

174
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:32,678
You never know,
7high might be similar to us in age.

175
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,056
I was born in 1987. Yes.

176
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:36,057
Which month?

177
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,892
-Which month?
-June.

178
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,227
He was born in early 1988.

179
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,103
-I was born in 1988,
-I see.

180
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,855
but still a rabbit, zodiac-wise.

181
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,023
Wait, I'm a rabbit too.

182
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:46,317
Right, because you were born in 1999.

183
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,485
You're 12 years apart.

184
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,612
What an unexpected connection.

185
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:52,240
-Why is that important?
-It's not?

186
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,658
-It is important.
-Sure.

187
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:55,409
-There are four rabbits.
-Sure, sure.

188
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,495
-It could be important.
-That's some coincidence.

189
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:00,831
-Hello.
-Hello there.

190
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,251
-Hello. Hello.
-It's CHUU.

191
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:04,669
My name is CHUU,

192
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:08,256
and I'm an idol singer
going on eight years strong now.

193
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,258
For eight years, CHUU has been a singer,

194
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,843
debuting in a girl group
and currently as a solo artist.

195
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:16,180
She is loved for her affability
and genuine bright personality

196
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:20,851
seen on various entertainment shows
and her namesake YouTube channel.

197
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:21,894
Thank you.

198
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,355
Still as lively as ever. You're so cute.

199
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:27,024
I heard you need to be super focused here.

200
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:30,987
I've been on a show with Ji-yeong before.

201
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,699
I remember her being
super cool, intellectual, and smart.

202
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:37,159
I have a lot to learn from her.

203
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,369
You were born in 1999?

204
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:40,580
-Yes, that's right.
-Wow, another rabbit.

205
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,290
-I was born in 1999 too.
-Me too.

206
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,709
You two were both born in 1999? I see.

207
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,627
We can form an alliance of rabbits.

208
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:50,840
Hello.

209
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,550
-Wow. Hello.
-Hi.

210
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:53,843
-Hello there.
-Hello.

211
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,678
Hello, I'm Tinno,

212
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,306
and I run a YouTube channel
focused on board games.

213
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:02,518
Tinno came through the open casting call
for The Devil’s Plan.

214
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:06,439
As a creator who runs
a YouTube channel about board games,

215
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:08,608
he is a master with extensive knowledge

216
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,943
of all board games available in Korea.

217
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,654
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello. Nice to meet you.

218
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,281
So many famous people.

219
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,242
Are you all done with introductions?

220
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:19,410
It's still ongoing.

221
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:20,369
It's in progress.

222
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,455
It restarts every time someone walks in.

223
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:24,081
Right, that makes sense.

224
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,750
When I play the Mafia game,

225
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,169
I'm usually the first
to get eliminated or to be killed.

226
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:31,714
It doesn't matter
if I'm a citizen or a member of the Mafia.

227
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:34,258
But those experiences taught me a lot.

228
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:37,678
I know how to be loved
by people and survive for a long time,

229
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,639
so I hope that will help me advance.

230
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,098
What's your zodiac animal?

231
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,558
I'm a puppy. A cute puppy.

232
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:43,893
Year of the dog?

233
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,144
Year of the dog, so 1994…

234
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,063
Sure, let's go with that.

235
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,398
Are you older than him?

236
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,317
-Are you the oldest?
-Am I?

237
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,902
-So that makes him?
-Then, 1982…

238
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,529
-Yes, that's right.
-Oh, I see.

239
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,031
That's a relief.

240
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:57,948
Why?

241
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,950
-I'm glad there's someone older than me.
-Yeah.

242
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,327
So, right now…

243
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,329
There's a wide range of ages.

244
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:06,374
-Hello.
-Hello. Hello there.

245
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:08,793
Hello, my name is Son Eun-yu.

246
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:12,088
Son Eun-yu was selected
through the open casting call.

247
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,423
As a graduate
of Ewha Womans University Law School,

248
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:17,885
she is a lawyer
who specializes in corporate M&As

249
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:20,638
at one of the top five law firms in Korea.

250
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,056
My name is Son Eun-yu.

251
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:24,517
I work for a large law firm,
specializing in M&As.

252
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:26,394
-A lawyer.
-Brains.

253
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:27,645
That's amazing.

254
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:31,315
I do know a handful of lawyers,

255
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,109
so I wasn't that impressed at first,

256
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,569
but she was cool
since she focused on corporate M&As.

257
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:38,531
She seemed sharp.
I think she'll do well here.

258
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:39,907
So, that makes ten of us.

259
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,201
There were 12 in season one, right?

260
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,828
Right, in season one.

261
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:46,831
-Hello.
-Wait.

262
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,749
-He looks like he could be a genius.
-Hi.

263
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,001
Hello.

264
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,211
He looks so intelligent.

265
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:53,879
Hello, I am Park Sang-yeon,

266
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,549
a student
at Yonsei University College of Medicine.

267
00:11:56,632 --> 00:12:01,887
Park Sang-yeon is the youngest participant
to pass the open casting call.

268
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:05,558
He represented Korea
at the 2021 International Physics Olympiad

269
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,017
where he won a gold medal.

270
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:10,271
He is currently a student
at Yonsei University College of Medicine.

271
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:11,439
PARK SANG-YEON

272
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,691
You look like an honor student.

273
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:14,692
Valedictorian.

274
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:17,236
Seriously, his looks…

275
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:19,196
If you represented Korea
at the Physics Olympiad,

276
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,491
you must be number one in physics
in Korea, right?

277
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,285
How can we compete against that?

278
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:25,828
A national rep…

279
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,371
I would say

280
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,665
that my chance of winning is 95%.

281
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,542
I would like to say 100%,

282
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,753
but the "5% approximation rule" states

283
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:36,964
that anything less than 5% is zero.

284
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:39,216
I feel like I should be friends with him.

285
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,302
-Should we?
-Yes.

286
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:43,554
What's your zodiac animal?

287
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,347
-I'm the year of the monkey.
-A monkey.

288
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,557
I can't tell the year.

289
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,559
Monkey. Would that be 1992?

290
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,352
I was born in 2004.

291
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,772
-You were born in 2004?
-You do look very young.

292
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,399
Right, 2004. That's unbelievable.

293
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,653
-Hello.
-Hello there.

294
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:01,363
She looks really young too.

295
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:04,533
-Hello.
-Hello there.

296
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:08,537
Hello. I am 25-year-old Kim Ha-rin.

297
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:12,291
Kim Ha-rin was selected
through the open casting call.

298
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,752
Having graduated from
Yonsei University College of Medicine,

299
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:16,670
she is now a practicing plastic surgeon.

300
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:20,633
She was always at the top of her class
since high school.

301
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:22,343
She is a hard-working genius.

302
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:24,303
So, that's the last spot filled.

303
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:27,306
-I look forward to our time together.
-Likewise.

304
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:30,100
Now, we have
a group forming based on school ties.

305
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,186
-He just came before you.
-Am I your alumnus?

306
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:33,521
Yes, I'm still in school.

307
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,481
I hope we get along.

308
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:38,818
We must cut all ties
based on schools and hometowns.

309
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,278
Yes, but zodiac animals should be fine.

310
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,780
We have the rabbit group.

311
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:43,948
The rabbit line.

312
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:45,407
Are we teaming up already?

313
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,743
-Should we sit down?
-Yes, right.

314
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,411
Wow, so this is how it is…

315
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,871
A lot has been updated.

316
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,832
It looks much cooler.

317
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:53,916
Are they the same?

318
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,460
-They are.
-Right. They would be at the start.

319
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:59,171
-Are they the same?
-What?

320
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:03,884
-Hello.
-Welcome.

321
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,177
-There's another?
-Hello.

322
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:08,138
Does that mean there are 13 contestants?

323
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,181
Nice to meet you.

324
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,724
I guess things have changed.

325
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:16,438
Hello, my name is Justin Min
and I'm a working actor in the States.

326
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:20,359
After his roles in
The Umbrella Academy and BEEF,

327
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:23,362
Justin H. Min has been garnering
attention from across the globe.

328
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:27,408
He is a gifted alum of Cornell University,
one of the Ivy League schools,

329
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:29,785
where he studied
political science and English literature.

330
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:33,247
I'm Justin Min, an actor from the States.

331
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,582
Justin Min.

332
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:38,002
So that's why you had
that different vibe about you. So cool.

333
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:44,884
I watched the first season in Korean.

334
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,595
I think I understood most of it,

335
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:50,639
but I did sometimes need the subtitles.

336
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:05,362
Last season, there were 12 players.

337
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,281
So maybe we have one more coming?

338
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:09,241
There will be 14 of us?

339
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,743
I suppose so. Wait.

340
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,330
-See.
-There we go.

341
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,875
-Hello.
-Wait, what's going on?

342
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,251
What's going on?

343
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,170
-Hello.
-What's going on?

344
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,005
I knew it.

345
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:26,258
-Hello.
-What's going on?

346
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:29,094
Hello, I am Lee Se-dol,
a former professional Go player.

347
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:34,099
Go Player Lee Se-dol won
14 major world Go tournaments.

348
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:38,812
He is a Go legend who impressed the world
by winning the last match

349
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:42,232
in a tumultuous battle
against the AI AlphaGo.

350
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,986
After retiring,
he has dabbled in various fields

351
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,739
as a board game inventor,
Poker player, and writer.

352
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:49,740
LEE SE-DOL

353
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,367
Yes, hello.

354
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,620
-I have goosebumps.
-Seriously? Me too.

355
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,498
What's he doing here?

356
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:59,291
To have such a legendary figure here…

357
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,752
When Lee Se-dol walked in, I was like,

358
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:04,254
"Wow, they're really
not holding back this time."

359
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:07,508
I'm former pro Go player Lee Se-dol.
Thank you for having me.

360
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:09,843
Welcome.

361
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,637
I didn't know who he was…

362
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,306
Hello. What's going on?

363
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,516
Seriously?

364
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:16,976
A Go player?

365
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,852
-I have goosebumps.
-Seriously? Me too.

366
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,229
I can't believe it.

367
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,696
No one else? Please lock the door.

368
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:34,743
It finally feels like I'm embarking
on something new and fresh.

369
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:39,039
I'm not sure
if it was nervousness or excitement.

370
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,874
I guess it was somewhere in between.

371
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:45,254
You know, I thought the game would evolve,
but season two is no joke.

372
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:46,880
But why are there 14 of us?

373
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,425
Exactly, the game lasts
the same amount of time.

374
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,427
They might be sending someone home today.

375
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,846
I hope not. I packed a lot of luggage.

376
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:56,348
I think I'd feel wronged
if I had to leave right away.

377
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,684
-Yeah, there was no need to pack.
-Right.

378
00:16:58,767 --> 00:16:59,893
Maybe in the early morning--

379
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:01,228
What's that?

380
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:02,896
That startled me.

381
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,981
Here we go.

382
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:05,190
That sound…

383
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:07,067
That means…

384
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,110
It's the devil.

385
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,653
Greetings.

386
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:13,490
I welcome you all to The Devil’s Plan.

387
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:19,329
For the next week, you will all
participate in a special game.

388
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:25,711
Starting now, I will explain
the rules of the special game.

389
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:32,342
You have each been given one new Piece.

390
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:36,638
Pieces can be gained or lost

391
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:41,685
based on your performance in games
as prizes or penalties.

392
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:45,147
Pieces, like currency,

393
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,233
may be used to purchase
advantageous items for games

394
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:52,154
or as bargaining chips
for negotiations between contestants.

395
00:17:54,406 --> 00:18:00,120
The two contestants with the most Pieces
will advance to the final round,

396
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,873
and the winner of this final round

397
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:06,126
will be crowned the victor
of The Devil’s Plan.

398
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:10,172
Contestants who lose all of their Pieces

399
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:13,467
will be immediately eliminated
and must leave the place.

400
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:15,636
In other words,

401
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:20,808
the Pieces in The Devil's Plan
will serve as your means of survival

402
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:25,104
and the authority or ability
to gain an upper hand in games.

403
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:28,398
Keep it in mind
that they are the keys to victory.

404
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:32,444
During the course of The Devil's Plan,
you will participate in two games daily.

405
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:36,698
First, there is the main match
that will take place during the day.

406
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:41,120
All surviving players will participate
in the main match,

407
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:45,082
and you will win or lose Pieces,
depending on the results of the game.

408
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:50,796
Furthermore, you will carry out
prize missions in the main matches

409
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:53,173
which will determine
the final prize amount.

410
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:57,302
Currently, the prize money
stands at zero won.

411
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:04,393
The prize mission will be different
for each main match.

412
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:05,602
Yikes!

413
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:08,272
Money will be pooled
with every successful mission.

414
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:12,234
The final prize may be amassed
as high as 500 million won.

415
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,485
500 million in a week.

416
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:19,032
These missions will
either unite you or tear you apart.

417
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:22,911
So give it your all
to rack up the prize money.

418
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:28,417
The players' standings will be determined

419
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,587
based on the number of Pieces
after the main matches.

420
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,921
Excluding the eliminated,

421
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,632
the top half of players
with the highest totals

422
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:36,800
will move to the living area

423
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:40,095
and the players in the bottom half
will move to the prison block.

424
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,096
What the heck?

425
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,055
This prison is…

426
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:44,975
We'll have inmates now, grouped together.

427
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:46,643
Seven-on-seven?

428
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,478
Wow, half of us.

429
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:52,316
In the event
there is an odd number of players,

430
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:56,862
an extra person will be sent
to the prison block.

431
00:19:57,487 --> 00:20:02,784
If there are players that cannot be split
due to having the same number of Pieces,

432
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:07,748
the player with the most Pieces chooses
a player to send to the prison block.

433
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:09,708
Buttering up matters.

434
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:14,922
Neither group of players may leave
their respective accommodations

435
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:17,925
until it's time
for the main match the next day.

436
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:22,930
All players in the prison block
will participate in a second game.

437
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:25,766
That will be the prison match.

438
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,060
Like a death match?

439
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:33,857
All players in the prison block
will be required to participate.

440
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,359
At the end of the prison match,

441
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:39,279
the player who finishes last
must return all of their Pieces

442
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:42,241
and be eliminated from The Devil's Plan.

443
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,533
-Crueler now.
-So scary.

444
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:44,993
Immediate elimination.

445
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,412
Let me introduce you to this building,

446
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:50,582
which has been prepared especially
for The Devil's Plan.

447
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,961
It has three main areas.

448
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:55,504
They are the game area,

449
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,089
the living area,

450
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:58,465
and the prison block.

451
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,133
Prison.

452
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:04,554
The game area is
where the main match takes place.

453
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,848
Entry is only possible
during the main match.

454
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,977
You may not leave until the game is over.

455
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:15,357
The living area
is where you are currently located.

456
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,569
It is where the players with the
most Pieces stay outside of game hours.

457
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:22,823
It offers comfortable lodging
and generous amenities.

458
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:25,117
It's upper class. There is class division.

459
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,662
The prison block is
divided into the living space

460
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:32,207
and the death room
where the prison matches will be held.

461
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,917
"Death room"? What?

462
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:36,128
So, one person will end up dying there.

463
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,462
I don't want to go there.

464
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,798
Inside the living space,

465
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:43,677
players are not allowed
to have any personal items,

466
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,306
and only basic amenities will be provided
under the supervision of guards.

467
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:49,141
So, insufficient meals?

468
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:54,980
Piece transfers between players
are only allowed in the living spaces.

469
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:58,692
You may not transfer Pieces
to other players in the areas

470
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:01,486
where the main matches
and prison matches are held.

471
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:05,532
The Devil's Plan
is a battle of intelligence.

472
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:10,954
Violence and theft are prohibited,
but all other tactics are allowed.

473
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,999
You can strategize, form alliances,

474
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:17,627
and even execute your own secret schemes.

475
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:21,757
Anyone can hold the key to victory,

476
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,344
but only one can open the door.

477
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:30,390
Though your victory may be stained
with deceit and betrayal,

478
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:35,270
we will gladly applaud you
and award you with the final prize.

479
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:40,317
Now, please spend some time as you wish

480
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,861
before the first main match begins.

481
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,365
I really don't want to go to prison.

482
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:48,367
I don't want prison time either.

483
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,411
I got nervous as soon as I heard

484
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:52,954
that someone would get eliminated today.

485
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,623
Wow, the gym here…

486
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:57,751
There is more equipment than I expected.

487
00:22:57,834 --> 00:22:59,711
It's modest but has everything you need.

488
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,421
I think it's good enough.

489
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:13,100
Hello.

490
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:15,811
There's a set of Wall Go here.

491
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,604
Lee Se-dol… Go…

492
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:18,647
Wow.

493
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,190
In the last season,

494
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:22,442
they ended up playing
some of the games in here.

495
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:23,610
But the Wall Go is

496
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:25,821
like a huge advantage
for Lee Se-dol, isn't it?

497
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,072
"Knight's Tour"?

498
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:29,324
We should review these in advance.

499
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,660
A one-person game?

500
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,286
-Earlier, we didn't…
-Hello.

501
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,496
Hello again.

502
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:37,916
The way I see it…
So you know, we read faces.

503
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,251
I read faces too.

504
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:41,711
Since I play a lot of games
with people I don't know…

505
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:42,629
Right.

506
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:47,175
If I were to choose the biggest "expert"
in this game, it would be him.

507
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:50,804
The first round is all about
who is better and who is not.

508
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:53,723
So if we can do it together,
then, let's do it.

509
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:54,683
Yes, please.

510
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:55,725
Let's stick together.

511
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,227
That's all I was looking for.

512
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,230
You made the right choice.

513
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:04,317
I was considering teaming up
with Tinno to play the game.

514
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:06,194
-What was your name again?
-Oh, right, names.

515
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:10,157
Seung-hyun, Ha-rin, Justin, Eun-yu,

516
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,201
So-hui, CHUU… CHUU!

517
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,412
Lord CHUU! I believe in you!

518
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:16,621
Lord CHUU!

519
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:17,539
I believe in you.

520
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:18,832
Yes, we believe.

521
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:20,333
Please save us.

522
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:21,460
Lord CHUU?

523
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:22,878
LEE SE-DOL
FORMER PRO GO PLAYER

524
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:25,505
CHUU was actually
the first person I recognized.

525
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:28,758
I was like, "What? CHUU's here."

526
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,635
Well, as a fan, I was happy to see her.

527
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:33,138
Still, being a fan is
just that, nothing more.

528
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:50,572
-I keep hearing English.
-He speaks it really well.

529
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:52,699
Wait, how do you speak such good English?

530
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:55,494
-His lectures are in English.
-Yeah.

531
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:59,456
Because he goes to KAIST.

532
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:03,585
His name is Hyun-joon.
He's a model. The tallest guy.

533
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:06,296
So-hui, next to him, is also from KAIST.

534
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:14,137
I'm very shy,
so I'm just going to sit here, too.

535
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:15,388
-It's so tiring.
-Yeah.

536
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:21,061
People in my industry don't really get
a chance to talk to other players.

537
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:25,315
But I'm trying
to force myself here. It's not easy.

538
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:34,449
We'll probably end up
dealing with some politics later.

539
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,201
What do you think that will be like?

540
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:40,539
Well, social tact isn't really my forte.

541
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:42,457
I'll have to leave it to others.

542
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:45,544
I don't think anyone will be
underhanded or anything like that.

543
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:49,089
-I mean, it's all just a part of the game.
-Right.

544
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:50,549
Yes, it's just a game.

545
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:53,593
It doesn't matter
because everyone has their own strategy.

546
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:56,471
They might end up revealing
another side of themselves.

547
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,765
Yeah, the devil inside might come out.

548
00:25:58,848 --> 00:25:59,808
Once you're in it…

549
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,560
Yeah, that's totally possible.

550
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:07,649
7 HOURS LATER

551
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:10,360
That makes no sense.
That's going back on your word.

552
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:13,363
I just don't understand.

553
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:15,115
Hold on. This is infuriating.

554
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:17,367
I've spoken to no one
since the game started.

555
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,743
This team is done now.

556
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,870
We can never be a team again. You know?

557
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,205
Can you handle me?

558
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:27,544
I'll go too.

559
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:28,753
Oh, my!

560
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:29,754
Here we go.

561
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,465
The main match will begin shortly.

562
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:33,466
The main match.

563
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:36,469
-Everyone, please gather in the game area.
-Oh, no!

564
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:37,762
Do we go now?

565
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,431
-Shall we?
-It's open now.

566
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:41,016
This is going to be fun.

567
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:41,933
Go for it!

568
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:42,892
Good luck!

569
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:43,852
Let's go in.

570
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,520
Shall we? Wow.

571
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,188
Hyun-joon, you're very brave.

572
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:48,231
Let's go!

573
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:50,734
-Let's try to have some fun.
-We got this!

574
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:54,571
I am looking forward to it.

575
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:55,947
This is my very first time.

576
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:56,990
First survival game?

577
00:26:57,073 --> 00:27:00,201
-No, I meant team games.
-Right.

578
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,037
-You always play one-on-one.
-Yes.

579
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:03,455
Let's go!

580
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:04,414
Oh, good luck!

581
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:07,542
It's open.

582
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:08,668
Oh, my!

583
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:09,836
Let's go in.

584
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,713
We need to go around the corner.

585
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:12,631
What the heck?

586
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:15,091
The lights are off.

587
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:16,217
What could be in there?

588
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:19,471
-Did you say they're off?
-So, this is how it feels.

589
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:23,391
Hey… It's okay. I'm good.

590
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:28,730
So, this is it.

591
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,857
They were there in season one too.

592
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,193
They're not mannequins,
they're real people.

593
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:35,612
Yeah. They were in season one, too.

594
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:36,571
Nice to meet you.

595
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:37,489
Hello.

596
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:38,740
Hello.

597
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:40,075
We look forward to it.

598
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:41,284
They went all out.

599
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:42,911
Wow, it's just like a prison cell.

600
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:44,037
A bit like a castle.

601
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,622
Welcome.

602
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:50,752
This is the game area
where you will play games from now on.

603
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:52,212
Game area.

604
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:56,508
Now, let me introduce
the first main match.

605
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:57,717
Here it comes.

606
00:27:57,801 --> 00:28:01,346
The first main match
of The Devil's Plan is…

607
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,807
Corrupt Police.

608
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:04,766
What's this?

609
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:07,769
Corrupt Police is a competition
between thieves who try to steal Pieces

610
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:10,814
and the police who must arrest them.

611
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:13,149
Before the game starts,

612
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:17,195
each player's role is
decided by a random draw.

613
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,407
Police.

614
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,659
There are 12 police officers in total,

615
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:25,829
including two of which are corrupt.

616
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:27,622
There are corrupt cops?

617
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:30,500
The police are divided into three teams,

618
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:33,962
the Red Team, Blue Team, and Green Team.

619
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,630
When you draw your role,

620
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:39,426
your team and order of play
will also be decided.

621
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:44,806
The two corrupt officers will be hidden
separately within two of the three teams

622
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:48,768
and the final team will just be
regular police officers.

623
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:50,311
So, they'll be separated.

624
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:53,565
The corrupt officers
know the identity of each other

625
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:58,319
and must help the thief evade
being caught by the ordinary officers.

626
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:00,655
It's a Mafia game variation.

627
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:01,823
They're traitors.

628
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:03,575
Thieves.

629
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:07,078
There are two thieves
that move around the game board.

630
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:10,915
Their goal is to collect Pieces
without being arrested by the police.

631
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:14,544
The thieves will know the identities
of the two corrupt officers.

632
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:16,129
The four of them are on one team.

633
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:17,756
They will rely on each other.

634
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:18,757
And work together.

635
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,134
Once all players
have been assigned their roles,

636
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:24,012
the identities of the two thieves
will be revealed.

637
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:27,515
Then, the thieves, along with the Red,
Blue, and Green police teams

638
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,143
will be separated
into different rooms to start.

639
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:34,731
All police officers will be informed
of the game's progress via radio.

640
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:37,859
The board for this game

641
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:41,488
will have routes on a map
based on the Seoul subway system.

642
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:48,870
There is a single Piece
hidden at 28 of the 176 stations,

643
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:52,499
and these locations
will be revealed only to the thieves.

644
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:54,876
When the game begins,

645
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:59,631
police officers of each team
will place their counter on a station.

646
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:03,968
It is possible to place
two or more counters at one station.

647
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:07,764
Once all counters are placed,
their locations will be made public.

648
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:10,934
Once all officers
have placed their counters,

649
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:13,436
the thieves will place their own counters,

650
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,065
bearing in mind the locations
of the officers' counters and Pieces.

651
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:21,528
The thieves will not be able
to place them at stations with Pieces.

652
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:26,950
The thieves' locations
will only be revealed when they're caught.

653
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:30,495
The game will last a total of 15 rounds.

654
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:35,166
In each round, the thieves will go first,
followed by the officers.

655
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:40,547
The thieves can move
up to two stations in three minutes,

656
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:44,425
and their updated locations will be shared
with the corrupt officers each round.

657
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:49,848
When a thief passes by
or lands at a station containing a Piece,

658
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,766
that Piece is collected automatically.

659
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:53,893
How nice.

660
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:59,315
The thieves can collect a maximum
of 12 Pieces out of a total of 28.

661
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:00,233
That's a lot.

662
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:02,694
But if they are arrested during the game,

663
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:04,946
they lose the Pieces they have acquired

664
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:07,699
and are immediately isolated elsewhere.

665
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:08,783
They go to jail.

666
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,828
Once the thieves have moved,

667
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:16,875
the police take their turn
in the order of Red, Blue, and Green.

668
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:20,587
The team order changes
sequentially each round.

669
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:25,258
During their turn, the police can take
a total of two actions.

670
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:27,427
The two actions are
"investigate" and "arrest."

671
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:29,012
Investigate.

672
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:33,349
You can investigate your current station
or move once and investigate.

673
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:35,685
If a thief has passed
through that station,

674
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:38,980
you'll find a clue
about the thief's whereabouts.

675
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,650
Clues can only be checked
by the relevant player.

676
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:47,697
They must then tell their team members
what they have found out,

677
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,199
but they are free to provide
whatever intel they wish.

678
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:51,784
So you can lie.

679
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:54,412
Once you have shared the clue
with your team members,

680
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:58,082
you must then decide whether or not
to share it with the other teams.

681
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:02,754
If you decide to share the clue,
press the "Clue Discovered" button.

682
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:06,049
When you press the button,
the clue will be revealed to all rooms

683
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:08,760
along with the station
where the clue was discovered.

684
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,387
Arrest.

685
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:14,015
You can make an arrest
at your current station

686
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,892
or after moving over one station.

687
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:19,604
If there is a thief in that station,
they will be arrested immediately.

688
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:23,733
A successful arrest will be announced
publicly to all teams.

689
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,987
If a corrupt officer arrests a thief,

690
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:31,950
the thief will be let go
and the failed arrest will be announced.

691
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:36,162
You can investigate and arrest once,
every turn, in any order you want.

692
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:39,248
Or you can repeat either action
twice in a row.

693
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:44,462
Players No. 1 through 4 on each team
must complete all of their moves in order

694
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:46,214
within the 5-minute time limit.

695
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:48,299
You can also check
the monitors in your rooms

696
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:51,094
for the locations
of the other teams' counters.

697
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:54,389
At the end of Rounds 5 and 10,

698
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:58,810
the total number of Pieces
acquired by the thieves will be revealed.

699
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,564
Additionally, up until the start
of the final two rounds,

700
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:06,192
you are free to make contact
with the other teams,

701
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:08,194
as long as it is outside of their rooms.

702
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:10,405
I guess we'll be locked in.

703
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:13,574
There are three ways for this game to end.

704
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:14,575
First,

705
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:19,247
if both thieves are arrested,
the game will end immediately.

706
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:21,332
Second,

707
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:26,254
if the thieves acquire 12 Pieces,
the game will end immediately.

708
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:27,922
Third,

709
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:32,719
if all 15 rounds are completed,
the game will end.

710
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:34,804
When the game ends,

711
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:37,098
the officers in each room
will immediately vote

712
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:39,475
on who they think the corrupt officer is.

713
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:43,646
The Pieces awarded
to each player will vary,

714
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,440
based on their role.

715
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:47,066
Different for each role?

716
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,609
Ordinary police officer.

717
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:51,779
If a team arrests a thief,
each ordinary police officer on that team

718
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:54,782
will receive one Piece
for every thief arrested.

719
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:58,619
They will also receive one extra Piece

720
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:04,000
if they correctly identify
the corrupt officer.

721
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:05,251
Okay.

722
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:08,796
If an ordinary police officer is
incorrectly accused of being corrupt,

723
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,216
said officer will not receive a Piece,

724
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:15,303
even if their team arrests a thief.

725
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,513
-Oh my.
-Better get it right then.

726
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:21,768
If a thief is arrested,
they don't get any Pieces.

727
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:23,019
Gosh.

728
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:24,645
If the thieves evade arrest,

729
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:28,357
they must give half of the Pieces
they have collected to the corrupt cops

730
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:30,318
and split the rest.

731
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,111
They really are corrupt.

732
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:36,532
If both corrupt officers are identified
through the votes,

733
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:39,702
the thieves can keep all the Pieces.

734
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,913
It's best to be the thief.

735
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:43,122
Corrupt officers.

736
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:46,667
If they remain unidentified
during the voting,

737
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:50,505
they share the Pieces given to them
by the thieves that weren't arrested.

738
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:54,759
Now, let me explain
the first prize mission.

739
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:55,843
The prize mission.

740
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:59,222
If the game finishes within ten rounds,

741
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:01,724
100 million won will be added
to the final prize.

742
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,143
Starting from Round 11,

743
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:07,897
the prize money will be reduced
by 20 million won each round.

744
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:12,693
We will choose
the corrupt officers in 30 minutes.

745
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:13,611
In 30 minutes?

746
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:16,781
Spend this time as you wish.

747
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,991
-The thing is…
-I know, we have to try to finish quickly.

748
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:21,119
-So, we need to pool intel.
-Absolutely.

749
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:23,496
-You have to share with your team.
-That way we can end early.

750
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:26,666
If you look at it strategically,

751
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:29,210
I think you have to share
the clues to start.

752
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:32,755
To start, I think we need to be
on the same page of sharing clues

753
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,757
if you're a regular officer.

754
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:38,094
But the corrupt officers
could feed us false intel.

755
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:41,097
Right, they have to hinder us
and help the thieves.

756
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:44,058
It's very important
who these corrupt officers are.

757
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:48,229
But there's no real way
to verify who is a corrupt officer.

758
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:50,690
For example, if another team failed
to make an arrest,

759
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:52,400
we might be able to infer corruption

760
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,277
if we discover there was a clue there.

761
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,404
Then, we'd know
there's someone corrupt there.

762
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:59,907
Failing to make an arrest
and having a clue are different, no?

763
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:03,619
Because the clue could tell us
that the thief had been there in the past.

764
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:07,832
"Arrest" is to catch a thief
who is at the current station

765
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:10,585
while "Investigate" is to find

766
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:14,005
traces of a thief
that has previously passed through.

767
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:18,801
There is no way of knowing
exactly when the thief passed through.

768
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:22,597
To protect a thief
during an investigation,

769
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,765
a corrupt officer on a team may lie

770
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:28,436
and tell their team members privately
that there were no clues.

771
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:31,355
However, if you go back
and investigate again

772
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,608
to find a clue,

773
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:37,236
that would mean the person
who investigated before is corrupt.

774
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,988
Or the thief passed by recently.

775
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:41,240
Right. You're right.
We talked about that, too.

776
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:43,326
We need to analyze the routes carefully.

777
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:47,622
But if you're a thief
and the corrupt officers get exposed,

778
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:48,956
you can keep all the Pieces.

779
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,541
That would be a perk.

780
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,710
What if the thief collects 11 Pieces

781
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:55,379
and exposes the corrupt officer
before collecting the 12th?

782
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,423
-Then, the thief…
-Hits a jackpot.

783
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:58,925
Being corrupt will be hard.

784
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,176
I feel sorry for them.

785
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:01,510
Exactly.

786
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:03,638
They could be tossed out
after providing aid.

787
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:06,641
I can't be a corrupt officer.
I'm terrible at lying.

788
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,100
I'd be obvious too.

789
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:09,310
I'm not good at lying.

790
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:10,937
I really suck at lying.

791
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,438
Just hope it isn't me.

792
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:15,358
The thieves will know
the identities of the corrupt officers,

793
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:18,569
and the corrupt officers
will know the thieves' locations.

794
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:20,655
They may share the rewards,

795
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:24,867
but they also hold
serious leverage over each other.

796
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:30,206
In numerous trials,
this game ended with their betrayals.

797
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:32,708
We just want to know who's corrupt.

798
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:34,752
Who's a thief and who's a corrupt officer.

799
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:36,921
I'll keep an eye on the Red, I mean, Blue…

800
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:40,883
I think they're up to something,
but I'm not sure.

801
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:44,553
But honestly,
alliances won't help in this game.

802
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:50,643
There's nothing for us to gain.
There's no need for us to shed corruption.

803
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:52,812
Why do you stop talking when I come near?

804
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:54,188
We didn't. We were talking.

805
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,815
You were just so dazzling.

806
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:57,108
You weren't even looking.

807
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:59,026
Is this really the way it's going to be?

808
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,111
No, I was blinded.

809
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:03,072
They would just stop talking
whenever I went near.

810
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:07,535
I'm starting to think
those three are in a secret alliance.

811
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:11,414
Time is up. Please gather in the hall.

812
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:14,166
We will now choose the corrupt officers.

813
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,459
Starting with Kang Ji-yeong,

814
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:18,462
please enter the dealer room
one at a time.

815
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:21,632
Hello.

816
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:24,510
Kang Ji-yeong, please choose a role card.

817
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:26,053
Well, it's random anyway.

818
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:31,183
If the corrupt police win,
I think they'd be pretty elated.

819
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:33,269
That would be good TV.

820
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:34,895
It would be exciting TV…

821
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:39,275
but I wonder if that's even necessary.

822
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:40,860
May I go now?

823
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:43,654
-First, let us help you with your radio.
-Oh, right.

824
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,614
We will use the radio to inform you

825
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:48,034
of any movements or arrests
made by the other teams.

826
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:53,664
-Are you a corrupt officer?
-What?

827
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:55,291
-Are you?
-Nope.

828
00:38:57,918 --> 00:38:59,628
Let's assume she isn't ordinary.

829
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:01,630
You don't seem thrilled about your role.

830
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:04,175
Neither happy nor upset,
just trying to figure this out.

831
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:05,217
Sure.

832
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:06,260
What color are you?

833
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:09,055
I am Blue.

834
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:10,222
Understood.

835
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:12,224
To be honest,

836
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:15,311
Ji-yeong was the first one to go,

837
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:18,022
and her eyes seemed to waver a lot.

838
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:23,277
Kyuhyun, please choose a role card.

839
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:32,244
-What are you?
-What is it? Which color?

840
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:33,496
Are we on the same team?

841
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:35,122
I guess they're on the same team.

842
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,624
-Good.
-We have to catch them.

843
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,667
Please choose a role card.

844
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:43,964
She's flustered.

845
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:45,508
She is. Oh, no.

846
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:47,593
-I'm Green.
-Green.

847
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:50,471
Sang-yeon, what are you?

848
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:51,806
Which team are you on?

849
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,516
-Red. An ordinary officer.
-Red.

850
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:56,894
-Thief?
-Thief?

851
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:59,188
No, not at all. I'm Red.

852
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:00,773
-Red?
-I got a good feeling about Red.

853
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:02,400
Red has a good mix.

854
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:05,403
Have a seat.

855
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:09,115
I've ended up on the Blue Team.

856
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:10,616
Blue?

857
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:12,743
-Here.
-Come over here.

858
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:13,702
Let's do our best.

859
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:15,538
Please choose a role card.

860
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:22,795
I'm a thief.

861
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:24,296
-Yikes.
-Really?

862
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,589
On the seventh try.

863
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:26,549
You thief!

864
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:27,716
Yoon So-hui the thief.

865
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,302
You're all acting
like you're ordinary officers.

866
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:34,056
Oh, poker face?

867
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,015
Se-dol?

868
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,976
-Which team are you?
-Green.

869
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:38,018
With me.

870
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:39,353
-I see.
-Green.

871
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:40,855
Are you a corrupt officer?

872
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:43,941
I'm not sure yet.

873
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:47,820
That's a very interesting answer.

874
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:50,072
I must be one or the other.

875
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,574
Se-dol, what are you?

876
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:52,575
I'm not a thief.

877
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,326
She looks like a thief.

878
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,494
Oh, I'm Red.

879
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:56,537
Red…

880
00:40:58,664 --> 00:40:59,623
That completes Red.

881
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:00,916
Red is decided then.

882
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,834
Green.

883
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:03,043
Hyun-gyu is Green.

884
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,128
I'm Green.

885
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,381
That means the thief
is either Lord CHUU or me.

886
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,341
-CHUU, please enter the dealer room.
-Yes?

887
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:10,551
It wouldn't open.

888
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:11,760
Hello.

889
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,599
-Please choose a role card.
-Sure.

890
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:17,725
-Tinno.
-Yes?

891
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:19,894
Please reveal the last role card.

892
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:22,730
-Lord CHUU.
-Yes?

893
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:24,064
Oh, she's out. Lord CHUU.

894
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,399
I'm on the Blue Team.

895
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,650
Oh my.

896
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:30,613
Tinno, you are a thief.

897
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:33,741
There's a connection
between the thieves and the corrupt cops.

898
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:36,827
Will the thieves screw
the dirty cops over? Or vice versa?

899
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:39,413
Or do the four of them stick together?

900
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,165
Thief. You're one of them!

901
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:42,583
A thief, of all things!

902
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:46,337
All players have now been assigned
their roles.

903
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:50,633
THIEVES
RED TEAM, BLUE TEAM, GREEN TEAM

904
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:54,512
The game will commence in 30 minutes.

905
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:57,473
We have to look at that
and decide where to put our counters.

906
00:41:57,556 --> 00:42:01,101
I think places where they're likely
to pass by. Transfer stations or…

907
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:03,479
There are three stations
where a lot converge.

908
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:07,233
Stations 104, 24, and 69. Those three.

909
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:11,028
We should definitely have someone from
our team checking Stations 104 and 24.

910
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:14,240
Here, here, and here.

911
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:15,241
Why?

912
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:16,742
A lot of converging lines.

913
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,703
But if the thief suddenly…

914
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:22,748
We don't know
where the thieves will start from, right?

915
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:24,667
We're going to decide that later.

916
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:27,169
The thieves are behind us.
Let's go to our room…

917
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:28,754
Right in front of the thieves?

918
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:32,132
I heard everything. Absolutely everything.

919
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:34,593
But here's a hint.
I'm going to be next to Ji-yeong.

920
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:36,679
But how do you want to do it?

921
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:38,597
Do you want to play it safe or rush?

922
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,599
Whether we get caught or not,

923
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:44,061
our top priority
is to increase the prize money.

924
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:46,397
Actually, that should be our common goal.

925
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,731
To not lose prize money.

926
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:49,650
We should stick to that…

927
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:52,194
Do you suspect anyone
on any of the other teams?

928
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:53,529
Of being corrupt?

929
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:57,658
One of the three is.
Ji-yeong, Kyuhyun, or CHUU.

930
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,118
They were on your radar.

931
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:01,370
I think it's one of those three.

932
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:03,372
You don't think it's Eun-yu?

933
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:07,001
I looked at Eun-yu's expression,
and she was so calm.

934
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,169
If she is, I have respect for her.

935
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:12,256
It would be great if we didn't have
a corrupt officer amongst us.

936
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:15,217
On the other hand,
I also think it could be better

937
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:17,553
to expose yourself
at the start if you're corrupt.

938
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:21,265
Telling us about the thieves
and working together might be good.

939
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:22,850
The corrupt officer?

940
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:24,810
-From the jump.
-Yeah, if you do…

941
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:26,729
I'm not corrupt, so I can't.

942
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:29,815
If I'm being honest,
I was suspicious of you earlier.

943
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:30,816
Really?

944
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:32,901
Even before I was on the Blue Team. But…

945
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:35,821
I actually wrote down here earlier
that your expression was weird.

946
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:36,780
I know, right?

947
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:40,284
Me too. I wrote it with a question mark.

948
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:42,119
Your expression was just so weird.

949
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:44,288
-What about you, Kyuhyun?
-No way.

950
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:45,914
-It's definitely not you?
-No.

951
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:48,751
Are you willing to bet your Piece on it?

952
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:50,044
Bet your Piece on it…

953
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:51,462
-I'd bet on it.
-I would too.

954
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:53,213
I will as well then. Me too.

955
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:55,424
Then I will too. Really? So none of us?

956
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:57,217
Then, do we not have one on our team?

957
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:58,886
It's possible.

958
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:00,054
Bet on our Pieces?

959
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:01,889
I can bet on anything.

960
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:04,516
Catching them should be our priority.

961
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,602
It's better if we catch them.

962
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:07,519
Right.

963
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:09,688
If we can't, it's all useless…

964
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,982
If we don't catch them,
we'll end up with zero.

965
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,567
It's like in the movies

966
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:16,654
where two units in the police department
compete against each other.

967
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:20,074
We need to be the ones
who catch one of them.

968
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:23,952
Come in.

969
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:25,704
Are the talks going well?

970
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:27,998
Come, oh right.
You're not allowed in here.

971
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:30,668
Yes. We haven't been given a room yet.

972
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:33,504
-Hello.
-So, this is what it looks like.

973
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:35,381
Where are you running off to?

974
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:37,132
Which direction?

975
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:40,135
Are you going left or right?

976
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:43,013
There's this psychological thing.
People turn right.

977
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:44,306
Then, you're going right?

978
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:46,975
I have to go left
because I have to do the opposite.

979
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:49,103
They also won't trust each other here.

980
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:51,939
Did you chat about who could be corrupt?

981
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:52,981
Did you?

982
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:53,899
We have no idea.

983
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:55,359
There's definitely one here.

984
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:56,443
Tell us.

985
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:59,988
We, thieves, have agreed
to trust the corrupt officers.

986
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:01,907
Trust them no matter what. Okay?

987
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:03,742
We will trust them until the end.

988
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:05,244
We will trust them.

989
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,539
We're going to trust them. We will.

990
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:10,290
-This is why it's better
-Trust no one.

991
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:11,250
to not say anything.

992
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:12,626
We know nothing.

993
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,586
You can go back to your strategizing.

994
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,046
Do come again.

995
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:19,675
Your time is up.

996
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:22,094
Corrupt Police begins now.

997
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:25,180
We will place the counters of the police.

998
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:30,018
The No. 1 officer in each team may spend
up to a minute to place their counter.

999
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:33,105
Justin Min, which station would you like
to place your counter?

1000
00:45:33,188 --> 00:45:34,523
Station 24.

1001
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:36,984
Justin Min's counter is placed
on Station 24.

1002
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:39,445
Red No. 1 has gone to Station 24.

1003
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:42,489
Where will you go?
Station 104 or near Station 24?

1004
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:43,699
Station 114.

1005
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:46,201
Lee Se-dol is placed on Station 114.

1006
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:47,453
-He's on 114?
-Station 114?

1007
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:49,621
How about Station 99?

1008
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:51,331
-Which station?
-Station 99.

1009
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:52,791
Blue No. 1 is on Station 99.

1010
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:55,210
Then Red No. 1 is on Station 24.

1011
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:56,170
Station 114 for this.

1012
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:59,173
-How about I go to Station 36?
-Sounds good.

1013
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:00,591
Station 69.

1014
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:01,925
Shall I go here?

1015
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:04,303
-I think that way is good.
-I will go to Station 89.

1016
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:05,721
Station 89.

1017
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:08,390
7high has placed
his counter on Station 89.

1018
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:10,100
Red has just gone to Station 89.

1019
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:11,268
Yes, same station.

1020
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:12,978
-They went for the same one?
-Yes, the same.

1021
00:46:13,061 --> 00:46:14,563
That would be a waste.

1022
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:17,316
They should be guarding over here.
That's weird.

1023
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:19,318
Are they trying to provoke us?

1024
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:21,945
I think I'll go over here.
There's no one here at all.

1025
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:24,364
-That looks good.
-There might be something here.

1026
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:25,616
Station 14.

1027
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:27,910
Shall we go for Station 27?
Yes, Station 27.

1028
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:29,703
Didn't we agree to
go for Station 153 earlier?

1029
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:30,913
Yes, let's go over there.

1030
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:32,790
Station 153. Everyone is there.

1031
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:34,249
So let's put one here.

1032
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:35,417
We choose Station 57.

1033
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:37,961
All the police counters have been placed.

1034
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:42,341
The thieves now have three minutes
to place their counters.

1035
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:44,551
We have no idea
where the thieves or Pieces are.

1036
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:45,469
We don't.

1037
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:46,553
And we won't.

1038
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:48,847
It looks like
there are fewer than 28 Pieces.

1039
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:51,517
It's probably going to go like…

1040
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,643
How should we proceed?

1041
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:54,019
Then, put it over here.

1042
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:56,230
-Here?
-I think that would be best.

1043
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:57,189
Are we set?

1044
00:46:57,272 --> 00:46:58,106
Okay. Done.

1045
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:01,235
All the counters have now been placed.

1046
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:03,111
This is ideal. If you just look at Green…

1047
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:04,112
-Right.
-and Blue.

1048
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:07,866
This is off on a tangent, but
don't you think 7high could be corrupt?

1049
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:08,909
Well…

1050
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:11,495
Because he placed
his counter on the same station?

1051
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:14,706
Because it seems like
he's taking the lead like this.

1052
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,041
Red is a bit strange.

1053
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:18,335
I can see him leading the team.

1054
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:20,420
A station with a lot of lines
is better, no?

1055
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:22,840
You can't catch anyone
with one counter anyway.

1056
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:33,642
Round 1 will now begin.

1057
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:38,188
For the next three minutes,
the thieves may move their counters.

1058
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:39,857
We go first, right?

1059
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,608
Move two spaces.

1060
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,610
-I will go two this way.
-Two spaces.

1061
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:46,154
They're bound to have put
their counters next to Pieces.

1062
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:47,990
Yes, I think so.

1063
00:47:48,073 --> 00:47:49,491
First, two of them…

1064
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:51,702
We've got one each now.

1065
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:53,662
Wow, this is intense.

1066
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:56,790
I guess they'll tell them
where we are via radio.

1067
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:58,876
The thieves have finished their turns.

1068
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:00,711
-They're done.
-That was quick.

1069
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:05,799
And the following message is sent
to the radios of the corrupt officers.

1070
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:08,886
The thieves are
currently located at ** station.

1071
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,806
-Red No. 1 goes first, right?
-Yes.

1072
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:16,852
Then, let's see what Red does this time.
Since they made a strange move last time.

1073
00:48:16,935 --> 00:48:19,187
The Red Team police officers have
five minutes

1074
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:22,024
to move their counters in turn.

1075
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:24,234
Investigate.

1076
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:26,987
Is investigating the right thing
to do on the first turn?

1077
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,989
-Is Red moving right now?
-Yes.

1078
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:30,365
Red No. 1, right?

1079
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:33,827
But are they showing us in real-time?

1080
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:35,787
It is in real-time. No movement yet.

1081
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:36,872
-Nothing yet?
-No.

1082
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:38,790
But they have five minutes for everything?

1083
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:39,958
What are they up to?

1084
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:42,252
How long do we have? Five minutes? Four?

1085
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:45,213
Yes, all four players must finish
within five minutes.

1086
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:48,258
Wait, they've moved.

1087
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:51,386
Red Team No. 1 has failed
to make an arrest at Station 25.

1088
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:52,763
They tried to make an arrest?

1089
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:55,057
They went to arrest before investigation?

1090
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,850
I think they're doing something weird.

1091
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:58,143
Why no investigation?

1092
00:48:58,226 --> 00:48:59,853
Which station will you move to?

1093
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:01,063
Station 26.

1094
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:02,522
Investigate.

1095
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,107
Please check the clue.

1096
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:10,405
NO CLUES

1097
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:13,492
No. There's no clue.

1098
00:49:13,575 --> 00:49:15,202
Next, it is Lee Seung-hyun's turn.

1099
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:17,037
Can you investigate in place?

1100
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,038
You can indeed.

1101
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:22,250
Why aren't they doing anything?

1102
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:24,044
It should be two at a time.

1103
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:25,170
They're doing nothing.

1104
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:26,630
What happens if time runs out?

1105
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:27,714
They will be skipped.

1106
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:28,966
Oh, I see.

1107
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:30,634
Which station would you like?

1108
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:31,718
Station 103.

1109
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:34,388
Lee Seung-hyun is investigating
at Station 103.

1110
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:35,389
Nothing.

1111
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:37,307
I'll move to Station 61.

1112
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:38,266
There's nothing.

1113
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:40,018
Next, it is 7high's turn.

1114
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:41,645
Investigate Station 90.

1115
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:43,438
Please check for a clue.

1116
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:46,858
There's nothing.

1117
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:48,986
-You can move once more.
-Investigate Station 130.

1118
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:51,905
You are moving to Station 130
and investigating.

1119
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:53,198
Please check for a clue.

1120
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:01,248
Blue Team police officers,

1121
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:04,835
you have five minutes
to execute your moves in order.

1122
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:07,254
Did they skip No. 4's turn?
No. 4 didn't do anything.

1123
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:08,672
They ran out of time.

1124
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:10,632
It's Blue Team's turn.

1125
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:12,592
I'll move to Station 63 and investigate.

1126
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:13,927
Please check for a clue.

1127
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:15,470
-There's no clue.
-No clue?

1128
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:16,638
No, there's no clue.

1129
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:18,765
Since No. 2 is on the way,
should I make a turn?

1130
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,934
Station 117? I'll go to Station 117.

1131
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:23,311
I will go to Station 117 and investigate.

1132
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:25,272
Moving to Station 117 and investigating.

1133
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:26,273
Okay.

1134
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:29,276
Shall I go south?

1135
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:30,736
Please check for a clue.

1136
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:32,863
It says there's nothing here.

1137
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:33,822
Nothing again?

1138
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:35,574
There's nothing. Then, No. 2's turn.

1139
00:50:35,657 --> 00:50:37,659
I will investigate Station 70.

1140
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:39,494
Please check for a clue.

1141
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:40,871
There isn't one.

1142
00:50:40,954 --> 00:50:42,622
Is she coming this way?

1143
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:43,665
Station 70.

1144
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:46,209
Took no action. Well, she might have.

1145
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:47,919
Investigated and not announced it.

1146
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:51,715
I will go one space down to Station 40.

1147
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:53,550
-Station 40?
-I'd like to investigate.

1148
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:55,385
Moving to Station 40 and investigating.

1149
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:56,845
There's nothing.

1150
00:50:56,928 --> 00:50:58,138
It's your turn, Ji-yeong.

1151
00:50:58,221 --> 00:51:00,182
-Shall I head up?
-If you go to Station 105…

1152
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:04,061
No, Red No. 2 is on Station 61,
so head in the direction of Station 13.

1153
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:05,979
I will go to Station 13 and investigate.

1154
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:08,607
Kang Ji-yeong moves
to Station 13 and investigates.

1155
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:10,525
No clue.

1156
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:12,235
I think they'll be on the outskirts.

1157
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,488
So, I guess I'd better go to Station 12.

1158
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:16,531
To Station 12 and investigate.

1159
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:17,741
Please check for a clue.

1160
00:51:19,284 --> 00:51:20,452
Nothing.

1161
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:22,579
I'm going to slide down on this turn.

1162
00:51:22,662 --> 00:51:25,415
Because No. 3 has
this area covered right now,

1163
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:28,168
I'll come from the other side and zero in.

1164
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:30,462
From above and the side, so Station 56.

1165
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:31,379
Investigate.

1166
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:33,757
Moving to Station 56 and investigating.

1167
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:36,635
-Nothing.
-Please check.

1168
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:40,305
I'm on my way down anyway.
I'll investigate Station 55 as well.

1169
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:42,349
Moving to Station 55 and investigating.

1170
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:43,934
There's nothing.

1171
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:45,060
Is it this way?

1172
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:51,024
Green Team police officers,
please execute your moves in order.

1173
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:53,860
Depending on where Se-dol goes, our team…

1174
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:54,778
Make your move.

1175
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:56,029
Which way should I go?

1176
00:51:57,405 --> 00:51:58,615
Should we go for Station 164?

1177
00:51:58,698 --> 00:52:02,327
Then, I will investigate Station 104.

1178
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:04,204
Please check for a clue.

1179
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:09,084
Okay.

1180
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:13,004
I'll move to Station 105 and investigate.

1181
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:14,214
Please check for a clue.

1182
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:17,092
They're here.

1183
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:19,219
Nothing, as expected.

1184
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:20,887
Jeong Hyun-gyu, it is your turn.

1185
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:22,722
I will investigate Station 142.

1186
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:24,432
Then, move to Station 80 and investigate.

1187
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:25,767
-No clues in either?
-No.

1188
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:26,685
Nothing, right?

1189
00:52:26,768 --> 00:52:27,978
It's Choi Hyun-joon's turn.

1190
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:29,813
I will investigate up to Station 149.

1191
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:31,356
Please check for a clue.

1192
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:32,774
No clue. Nothing.

1193
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:33,942
I got nothing.

1194
00:52:34,025 --> 00:52:35,193
Above that is Station 95, right?

1195
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:37,154
I will move to Station 95 and investigate.

1196
00:52:37,737 --> 00:52:40,240
Nothing. Nothing at all.

1197
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:42,367
But that's to be expected right now.

1198
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:45,829
There probably were no clues this round.
We should've tried to share some info.

1199
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:48,248
Round 2 will now begin.

1200
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:49,374
Great.

1201
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:51,418
That worked well.

1202
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:55,881
Thieves, you have three minutes
to move your counters.

1203
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:57,424
Before discussing it further,

1204
00:52:57,507 --> 00:52:59,134
No. 4 should go over
and ask within two minutes.

1205
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:00,093
I'll go.

1206
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:01,511
Someone should join you.

1207
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:03,471
You never know,
he might say something different.

1208
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:04,723
-What should I ask?
-To Green?

1209
00:53:04,806 --> 00:53:09,102
Yes. Tell them Green No. 2 and Blue No. 2
should meet in order to cooperate.

1210
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:10,187
Sweep up the bottom.

1211
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:12,397
A minute and 30 seconds.

1212
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:16,776
But we can't go inside.

1213
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:17,861
-Yes?
-Come outside.

1214
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:18,778
Green Team.

1215
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,155
Let's do it together.

1216
00:53:20,238 --> 00:53:21,239
You have to come out.

1217
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:23,658
We had no clues. Not a single one.

1218
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:25,202
Us, too. Go along the bottom.

1219
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:27,913
Along the bottom?
But they might be on the top.

1220
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:29,039
The thieves are here.

1221
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:31,166
We shouldn't talk with them here.

1222
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:32,292
We'll go to the top.

1223
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:34,753
They can't escape
if they were around there anyway.

1224
00:53:34,836 --> 00:53:36,213
Blue Team police officers,

1225
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:39,966
you have five minutes
to execute your moves in order.

1226
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,551
Down. Go down.

1227
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:44,554
Green asked us
why there was no clue shared.

1228
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:46,097
I told them we didn't have any.

1229
00:53:46,806 --> 00:53:48,683
I will move to Station 85 and investigate.

1230
00:53:49,267 --> 00:53:51,770
Son Eun-yu will move
to Station 85 and investigate.

1231
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:52,979
No clues.

1232
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:55,899
To Station 71… Wait.

1233
00:53:55,982 --> 00:53:58,902
If I investigate here first,
won't I see if they've passed by?

1234
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:00,987
-That's true.
-I'll investigate first.

1235
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:01,947
Station 40.

1236
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:03,240
Stay in place?

1237
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:05,951
They can move two spaces at a time,
they might have gone by.

1238
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:10,413
Nothing. I will go down one to Station 71.

1239
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:13,583
Nothing.

1240
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:15,543
Kang Ji-yeong, it's your turn.

1241
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:19,881
I will go to Station 11 and investigate.
Then, go to Station 163.

1242
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:21,508
No clues.

1243
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:24,344
Why not?

1244
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:27,013
I will investigate Stations 53 and 54.

1245
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:28,223
Please check for a clue.

1246
00:54:28,306 --> 00:54:30,642
Okay. Nothing.

1247
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:34,396
Green Team police officers,
please execute your moves in order.

1248
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:37,107
Or should I go in this direction?

1249
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:39,526
Should I go this way?

1250
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:41,903
What number was that guy who plays Poker?

1251
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:42,862
Red No. 3.

1252
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:44,906
They might be working with him.

1253
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:47,158
Crossing over this way.

1254
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:49,494
I'd stick by the corrupt officer
if I were a thief.

1255
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:54,791
I'll move to Station 132.

1256
00:54:54,874 --> 00:54:57,419
Move to Station 132 and investigate.

1257
00:54:59,587 --> 00:55:00,672
Nothing.

1258
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:09,264
But if it keeps going like this,
one of us must be lying.

1259
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:11,891
It might not be someone here.

1260
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:14,352
It might be two people
in the other groups.

1261
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:17,147
Someone here might have found something

1262
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:18,898
and kept quiet, as you said.

1263
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:23,194
Red Team police officers,
please execute your moves in order.

1264
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:25,196
Which station would you like to move to?

1265
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,406
Where shall I go?

1266
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:28,116
Red is last.

1267
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:30,869
Is this the end of Round 2?
Already? Once this is done?

1268
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:35,915
What the? Why is he going there?

1269
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:37,876
Tell me about it, it's suspicious.

1270
00:55:37,959 --> 00:55:40,170
Is the whole Red Team corrupt?

1271
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:41,921
I think they're acting really weird.

1272
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:43,214
Why did he go back to Station 25?

1273
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:44,799
That's weird.

1274
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:46,593
There's definitely a saboteur.

1275
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:49,304
Red keeps acting oddly.

1276
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:50,889
I will go to Station 8.

1277
00:55:50,972 --> 00:55:52,057
Station 9.

1278
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:55,935
I will go to Station 131 and investigate.
I'll just stay there.

1279
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:57,687
-Are you done?
-Yes.

1280
00:55:57,771 --> 00:56:00,648
-I mean, why would he go there?
-Right?

1281
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:02,317
Why is he following me?

1282
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,861
Is he just checking
everything, just in case?

1283
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:08,948
What is he doing?

1284
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:10,742
If I were a corrupt officer,

1285
00:56:10,825 --> 00:56:12,410
I think I'd position myself

1286
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:15,663
to tell others that the thieves
aren't there so they don't come down.

1287
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:17,791
-Position myself near the thieves.
-Right.

1288
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:20,460
All of them, except for No. 3,
are way up there.

1289
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:21,836
They're all weird.

1290
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,963
Round 3 will now begin.

1291
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:26,132
Yes?

1292
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:27,675
It's Green.

1293
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:29,719
-Green Team.
-Let's step out.

1294
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:30,929
-CHUU.
-Yes?

1295
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:33,181
Please go up. And I'll go this way.

1296
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:34,599
So we will cover the bottom.

1297
00:56:34,682 --> 00:56:37,477
Then, we will go up
and turn left onto the light green line.

1298
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:38,937
I'll just go straight then.

1299
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:40,271
What's with Red?

1300
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:42,190
-Red is weird, right?
-Red is weird.

1301
00:56:42,273 --> 00:56:43,525
They've been strange.

1302
00:56:43,608 --> 00:56:45,652
-We were saying that.
-Red must be a mole.

1303
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:48,071
See, Green is the only one coming by.

1304
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:49,989
-So strange.
-Why isn't Red coming out?

1305
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:54,369
Red goes back and forth, blocking the way.

1306
00:56:54,452 --> 00:56:56,371
Or comes to the station we're already at.

1307
00:56:56,454 --> 00:56:58,289
We have 12 officers
including corrupt ones,

1308
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:00,250
but it feels like
there are only eight good cops.

1309
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:01,709
Green Team police officers…

1310
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:02,794
-Let's go.
-Okay.

1311
00:57:02,877 --> 00:57:04,546
…you have five minutes
to execute your moves in order.

1312
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:05,839
What's going on?

1313
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:09,384
I will go to Station 133.
Then, move to Station 134 and investigate.

1314
00:57:09,467 --> 00:57:11,803
I will move to Station 77 and then 76.

1315
00:57:11,886 --> 00:57:14,305
I will investigate
Station 125 and Station 67.

1316
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:17,934
I will move to Station 92 and investigate.
Then, go to Station 136 and investigate.

1317
00:57:18,017 --> 00:57:20,061
How could there not be a single clue?

1318
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:23,273
Red Team police officers,
please execute your moves in order.

1319
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:25,650
Let's see what stunt
Red Team pulls this time.

1320
00:57:25,733 --> 00:57:27,360
Arrest at Station 98.

1321
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:29,404
Arrest at Station 99.

1322
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:30,738
-Arrest?
-Arrest failed.

1323
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:31,656
Who's that?

1324
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:35,243
This person doesn't investigate.

1325
00:57:35,326 --> 00:57:37,620
I'm thinking
we should send someone up there.

1326
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:39,581
It's still quite early in the game.

1327
00:57:39,664 --> 00:57:42,375
-There's no real reason to make arrests.
-You're right.

1328
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:45,753
-They haven't even investigated yet.
-Attempting arrests don't reveal traces.

1329
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:47,297
-You just don't catch them.
-True.

1330
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:49,382
Shall I go to Stations 8 and 7?

1331
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:51,050
I will investigate Station 130.

1332
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:52,594
I will move to Station 90.

1333
00:57:52,677 --> 00:57:55,513
Moving to Station 90 and investigating.

1334
00:57:56,514 --> 00:57:58,308
-The Red Team is so…
-It's so weird.

1335
00:57:58,391 --> 00:57:59,476
I'm getting annoyed.

1336
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:02,312
-He just keeps going back and forth.
-No. 3 is so weird.

1337
00:58:02,395 --> 00:58:03,813
Yes, why is he doing that?

1338
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:07,358
Red No. 3 has gone back
to the same place again.

1339
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:10,236
Red just keeps trolling us.

1340
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,863
Right, the thieves are near Red.

1341
00:58:11,946 --> 00:58:13,406
We need to go to Red.

1342
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:16,075
Go this way, since we have
this area covered for now.

1343
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:18,161
How about going near Red No. 3?

1344
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:21,289
Me? Get on that line? Okay, let's go.

1345
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:23,917
Go straight down to Station 87
so you can get close to Red No. 3.

1346
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,877
Good. Great. That's a great idea.

1347
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:28,922
Hey, who lies this well? Seriously.

1348
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:31,216
We don't have a corrupt officer, right?

1349
00:58:34,552 --> 00:58:36,054
Our team has a corrupt officer.

1350
00:58:36,137 --> 00:58:37,722
-On our team?
-Us?

1351
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:39,557
There is a corrupt officer on our team.

1352
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:41,768
-How do you know?
-You're saying there's one on our team?

1353
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:43,186
How do you know?

1354
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:44,687
It's not me, but there is one.

1355
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:45,897
It's not me either.

1356
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:47,190
Are you sharing now?

1357
00:58:47,273 --> 00:58:48,191
All of a sudden?

1358
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:49,484
Yes.

1359
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:51,903
Before we even chose our roles
at the beginning,

1360
00:58:51,986 --> 00:58:54,239
I made an alliance with So-hui.

1361
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:55,365
Did you choose, So-hui?

1362
00:58:55,448 --> 00:58:56,616
You haven't, right?

1363
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:59,035
When we do this,

1364
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:03,665
as long as we're not
corrupt officers or thieves,

1365
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:06,042
-how about helping each other out?
-Okay.

1366
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:08,294
Please choose a role card.

1367
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:10,213
I will take this one.

1368
00:59:10,296 --> 00:59:13,049
You are Blue Team No. 1,
an ordinary police officer.

1369
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:15,635
I'm a thief.

1370
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:17,971
-Really?
-There's a thief about.

1371
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:19,597
So-hui.

1372
00:59:19,681 --> 00:59:21,599
Can you just let me know
if there's one on my team?

1373
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:23,226
Just the presence of a corrupt officer.

1374
00:59:23,309 --> 00:59:25,144
There is.

1375
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:26,229
There is?

1376
00:59:26,312 --> 00:59:27,397
She said there was one.

1377
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:30,775
That's why I'm so conflicted right now.

1378
00:59:30,858 --> 00:59:33,987
That's why I just don't know right now.

1379
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:36,406
I just don't think
there's any way for us to win.

1380
00:59:36,489 --> 00:59:38,575
If we don't expose them.

1381
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:41,494
If we don't expose them?

1382
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:43,788
Are you going to admit it?

1383
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:45,915
Fess up.

1384
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:49,085
If there is even one corrupt officer
on the Red Team right now,

1385
00:59:49,168 --> 00:59:52,755
they can't conspire with the thieves
while cooperating with everyone.

1386
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:55,842
No, I'm thinking,
"Did I trust them too much?"

1387
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:58,261
And feeling quite bewildered.

1388
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:02,181
But if it's exposed,
that would be better for us.

1389
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:03,766
No, it's really not me.

1390
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:05,059
-Really?
-No!

1391
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:06,519
Blue Team police officers,

1392
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:09,981
you have five minutes
to execute your moves in order.

1393
01:00:10,064 --> 01:00:12,191
-I'm nervous.
-Son Eun-yu, it's your turn.

1394
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:15,194
-I'll go to Station 86 and investigate.
-Moving to Station 86 and investigating.

1395
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:17,530
I will go down one
and investigate there too.

1396
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:20,283
I will go to Stations 40 and 41.

1397
01:00:20,366 --> 01:00:21,492
Nothing.

1398
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:26,456
I'll go to Station 162.
I'll go to Station 88 and investigate.

1399
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,166
No clues.

1400
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:31,628
Next, it is Kyuhyun's turn.

1401
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:33,463
I will investigate Station 16.

1402
01:00:33,546 --> 01:00:35,632
Nothing. So, where shall I go now?

1403
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:37,258
Let's keep going down.

1404
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:39,469
-Station 52.
-I will investigate Station 52.

1405
01:00:39,552 --> 01:00:41,387
-Please check for a clue.
-Nothing.

1406
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:43,306
-Nothing?
-Seriously?

1407
01:00:43,389 --> 01:00:45,308
Round 4 will now begin.

1408
01:00:45,391 --> 01:00:46,392
Let's go for Round 4.

1409
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:50,104
Thieves, you now have three minutes
to move your counters.

1410
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:53,733
-One, two, three, four, five.
-Go here, then here. Then, here.

1411
01:00:54,233 --> 01:00:55,318
We'll be done by ten.

1412
01:00:55,401 --> 01:00:56,569
Really?

1413
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:57,987
That would be great.

1414
01:00:58,071 --> 01:01:00,490
If there is a corrupt officer there,

1415
01:01:00,573 --> 01:01:01,949
they will be taken out.

1416
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:05,036
That leaves five people,
and those five will split it.

1417
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:09,832
It's not just the one on the Red Team.
The other one will also be taken out.

1418
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:13,211
They need to take out
both corrupt officers to keep the loot.

1419
01:01:13,294 --> 01:01:17,215
I'd prefer the corrupt officers confess
so we can move this conversation along.

1420
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:19,133
The corrupt officers need to confess.

1421
01:01:19,801 --> 01:01:23,680
Red Team police officers,
please execute your moves in order.

1422
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:26,808
Investigate Station 91
and then Station 44.

1423
01:01:26,891 --> 01:01:29,519
It's like they're trying
to block off this line from us.

1424
01:01:29,602 --> 01:01:32,271
Make an arrest at Station 161.

1425
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:34,065
Was someone arrested? Station 161?

1426
01:01:34,148 --> 01:01:35,191
Failed arrest?

1427
01:01:35,274 --> 01:01:37,318
If they're not trolling us
and making arrests,

1428
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:39,696
that means they've done
a lot of investigating.

1429
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:42,073
I reckon they're just trolling.

1430
01:01:42,156 --> 01:01:45,410
Blue Team police officers,
please execute your moves in order.

1431
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:51,124
How are things going?

1432
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:53,251
We haven't found any clues.

1433
01:01:53,334 --> 01:01:54,252
Really? Not at all?

1434
01:01:54,335 --> 01:01:57,088
Red, why are you playing so eccentrically?

1435
01:01:57,171 --> 01:01:58,756
-What should we do?
-You're Red?

1436
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,675
-Red, why are you so…
-Red is here.

1437
01:02:00,758 --> 01:02:01,884
My first Red encounter.

1438
01:02:01,968 --> 01:02:03,636
If we're being honest,

1439
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:06,389
we feel like Red Team is trolling us.

1440
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:08,015
Why?

1441
01:02:10,601 --> 01:02:11,477
"Why?"

1442
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:12,770
Our moves.

1443
01:02:12,854 --> 01:02:14,522
I don't think thieves will get caught.

1444
01:02:15,273 --> 01:02:16,107
To be honest.

1445
01:02:27,201 --> 01:02:29,662
Everyone is looking at me so coldly.

1446
01:02:30,329 --> 01:02:32,749
I'm about to lose it.
Why are they all treating me like that?

1447
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:37,295
Round 5 will now begin.
Thieves, please move your counters.

1448
01:02:37,378 --> 01:02:39,130
Here come the thieves.

1449
01:02:39,714 --> 01:02:41,758
Purple will move to Station 105.

1450
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:43,801
Yellow No. 2 will move to Station 35.

1451
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:45,970
It's so empty over here.

1452
01:02:46,053 --> 01:02:49,891
Was it their mistake
to bring this game to me?

1453
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:55,688
We haven't spoken
to a single corrupt officer,

1454
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:59,108
but they've done an excellent job
of covering up our tracks.

1455
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:06,240
How could they leave no trace behind?

1456
01:03:06,324 --> 01:03:07,784
There must have been something.

1457
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:09,577
It must be the corrupt officers.

1458
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:11,913
The 12 police officers have passed

1459
01:03:11,996 --> 01:03:14,040
through all these stations
over five rounds.

1460
01:03:14,665 --> 01:03:21,047
The two corrupt officers are clearly lying
to keep the thieves safe.

1461
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:23,216
That concludes Round 5.

1462
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:27,678
So far,
the thieves have acquired six Pieces.

1463
01:03:28,513 --> 01:03:29,472
Halfway there.

1464
01:03:29,555 --> 01:03:30,765
They acquired a lot.

1465
01:03:30,848 --> 01:03:33,267
How far have they traveled to get them?

1466
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:37,271
They'll never find us. They never will.

1467
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:40,525
Round 6 will begin in 10 minutes.

1468
01:03:40,608 --> 01:03:41,984
Where are you?

1469
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:43,361
You've almost got us.

1470
01:03:43,444 --> 01:03:46,155
We're right in front of you,
right in front of your nose.

1471
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:48,074
-In the middle--
-It's really not me.

1472
01:03:48,157 --> 01:03:49,951
-Are you sure?
-Yes, it's really not me.

1473
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:51,452
I'm just confused.

1474
01:03:51,536 --> 01:03:55,540
Because catching the corrupt officer is
the only way for our team to survive.

1475
01:03:55,623 --> 01:03:57,208
-It's not me. Yes!
-Really?

1476
01:03:57,291 --> 01:03:59,377
Even if I was,
I would at least save our team.

1477
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:00,962
But I am not one.

1478
01:04:01,045 --> 01:04:02,213
It's really not me.

1479
01:04:02,296 --> 01:04:03,756
Then, who do you think it is?

1480
01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:09,846
Did anything come out
after all that investigating?

1481
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:14,225
Then, everyone is going about this
the wrong way.

1482
01:04:14,308 --> 01:04:15,226
We found nothing.

1483
01:04:15,309 --> 01:04:16,769
How is the Red Team playing?

1484
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:18,855
You shouldn't just keep picking
on our team.

1485
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:21,315
Neither Green
nor Blue has shared any intel.

1486
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:23,401
-We've been sharing with Green.
-We are.

1487
01:04:23,484 --> 01:04:26,195
Tell us where you're headed.
Then, we could follow suit.

1488
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:28,865
-Besides, you've already got a plan.
-What plan?

1489
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:32,034
This guy is definitely either
a corrupt officer or a saboteur.

1490
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:33,119
7HIGH

1491
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:36,539
If you don't do anything, you'll end up
in prison or maybe even go home.

1492
01:04:36,622 --> 01:04:39,333
So you need to play your own game.

1493
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:43,045
My face is getting red
because I couldn't do anything.

1494
01:04:46,465 --> 01:04:49,218
Do you guys…
Do you have a corrupt officer?

1495
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:53,222
I really have no idea.
I don't know if there's one on our team.

1496
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:57,977
I thought we didn't. I thought for sure.
I was pretty sure we didn't.

1497
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:01,063
In the last couple of rounds,
things have gotten strange.

1498
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:01,981
Suddenly?

1499
01:05:02,064 --> 01:05:03,774
Who?

1500
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:04,692
7HIGH

1501
01:05:04,775 --> 01:05:06,152
Yes!

1502
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:09,947
We already think
he's in cahoots with the thieves.

1503
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:12,325
He's acting really strange.

1504
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:14,118
You're not corrupt, are you?

1505
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:16,287
You're not, right?

1506
01:05:16,370 --> 01:05:18,623
Don't be swayed.
You need to play your own game.

1507
01:05:19,373 --> 01:05:20,666
So-hui.

1508
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:23,711
There's one on our team, right?
A corrupt officer on our team?

1509
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:30,885
It doesn't seem like there is, right?

1510
01:05:30,968 --> 01:05:32,762
So you guys don't have a corrupt officer?

1511
01:05:36,474 --> 01:05:38,768
Do you think that you guys have
one in your group?

1512
01:05:41,687 --> 01:05:44,857
Why do you keep going back and forth?

1513
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:48,361
We thought that if we spread out too much,
we wouldn't be able to catch them.

1514
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:52,156
So we focused on a specific area.
Which is why we went back and forth a bit.

1515
01:05:52,239 --> 01:05:53,407
Who came up with that?

1516
01:05:54,492 --> 01:05:55,952
7high?

1517
01:05:56,535 --> 01:05:58,037
Do you trust 7high?

1518
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:59,205
I'm not sure.

1519
01:05:59,288 --> 01:06:01,040
Time's up.

1520
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:03,125
Round 6 will now begin.

1521
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:05,753
Thieves, please move your counters.

1522
01:06:05,836 --> 01:06:07,213
From Station 104 to 114.

1523
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:11,258
Thief No. 2 will go
from Station 34 to 155.

1524
01:06:11,342 --> 01:06:13,469
Let's try to at least catch one thief.

1525
01:06:13,552 --> 01:06:14,387
We should.

1526
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:15,888
Lee Se-dol, it's your turn.

1527
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:17,765
I will move to Station 14.

1528
01:06:17,848 --> 01:06:20,059
Please check for a clue.

1529
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:21,185
Please.

1530
01:06:21,268 --> 01:06:22,687
INVESTIGATION IN PROGRESS

1531
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:23,896
CLUE DISCOVERED

1532
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,815
-Hold on, there's a clue.
-There is?

1533
01:06:25,898 --> 01:06:27,858
-There's one at Station 14?
-Yes.

1534
01:06:27,942 --> 01:06:29,860
The first clue we found. Station 14.

1535
01:06:29,944 --> 01:06:30,820
Wow.

1536
01:06:30,903 --> 01:06:32,029
Would you like to share?

1537
01:06:32,113 --> 01:06:34,949
Hold on. Should we share this or not?

1538
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:40,246
The important thing here is
that Red will receive it too.

1539
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:42,623
They won't share it
so they can keep everything.

1540
01:06:42,707 --> 01:06:44,250
With the other teams?

1541
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:46,043
They won't do it. No one is sharing.

1542
01:06:46,127 --> 01:06:47,712
Right, they're in a team battle.

1543
01:06:47,795 --> 01:06:49,588
-Then, we won't share it.
-Okay.

1544
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:51,632
This is driving me crazy.

1545
01:06:51,716 --> 01:06:54,260
Shall I go this way? Or this way?

1546
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:56,053
I could also go this way.

1547
01:06:56,137 --> 01:06:57,471
We don't have much time.

1548
01:06:57,555 --> 01:06:58,973
Then, shall I go to Station 13?

1549
01:06:59,056 --> 01:07:01,017
-Go to Station 13.
-Turn around if there's nothing.

1550
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:03,269
I will move to Station 13 and investigate.

1551
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:05,229
Please check for a clue.

1552
01:07:05,312 --> 01:07:06,522
Please!

1553
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:08,149
There's no clue.

1554
01:07:08,232 --> 01:07:09,316
They didn't go this way.

1555
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:10,901
Okay, let's do our moves.

1556
01:07:10,985 --> 01:07:12,611
There must be something here.

1557
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:13,738
So, let's go here.

1558
01:07:13,821 --> 01:07:15,489
We'll first go up there.

1559
01:07:15,573 --> 01:07:16,991
I will move to Station 36.

1560
01:07:17,074 --> 01:07:18,534
Please check for a clue.

1561
01:07:19,201 --> 01:07:20,327
CLUE DISCOVERED

1562
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:21,537
What?

1563
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:25,332
Will they share it or not?

1564
01:07:25,416 --> 01:07:27,168
-There's a clue at Station 36.
-There is?

1565
01:07:27,251 --> 01:07:28,335
Should I make an arrest?

1566
01:07:28,419 --> 01:07:29,670
Maybe we should?

1567
01:07:29,754 --> 01:07:32,048
There wasn't one here earlier.
I did a full lap.

1568
01:07:32,131 --> 01:07:33,424
Let's go for it!

1569
01:07:33,507 --> 01:07:35,384
Shall we share it and then, do the arrest?

1570
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:37,344
-No, just do the arrest.
-Okay.

1571
01:07:37,428 --> 01:07:39,013
-Please…
-Please.

1572
01:07:39,096 --> 01:07:42,224
Green No. 2 has failed
to make an arrest at Station 36.

1573
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:43,476
Fail.

1574
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:45,019
They made an arrest?

1575
01:07:45,519 --> 01:07:47,063
-Kim Ha-rin, it's your turn.
-Okay.

1576
01:07:47,146 --> 01:07:48,647
Maybe we should go back this way?

1577
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:51,734
Since there's one here and another here,
I think I better go back down.

1578
01:07:51,817 --> 01:07:53,402
I will move to Station 30 and investigate.

1579
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:55,362
Moving to Station 30 and investigating.

1580
01:07:55,446 --> 01:07:56,822
Please check for a clue.

1581
01:07:57,907 --> 01:07:59,867
I will move to Station 31 and investigate.

1582
01:07:59,950 --> 01:08:01,786
Moving to Station 31 and investigating.

1583
01:08:01,869 --> 01:08:02,703
There's nothing.

1584
01:08:02,787 --> 01:08:04,205
There's no clue?

1585
01:08:04,288 --> 01:08:06,123
-So one here but nothing here?
-Nothing.

1586
01:08:06,207 --> 01:08:08,375
Then, I think they will be
somewhere over here.

1587
01:08:11,045 --> 01:08:12,338
Yes?

1588
01:08:12,421 --> 01:08:13,297
What's going on?

1589
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:15,174
There are clues on Stations 14 and 36.

1590
01:08:15,257 --> 01:08:18,135
There are clues on Stations 14 and 36.

1591
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:21,263
Red Team police officers,
please execute your moves in order.

1592
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:24,058
I'm being targeted by No. 1.

1593
01:08:24,141 --> 01:08:26,435
Who is No. 1? Red No. 1?

1594
01:08:26,519 --> 01:08:28,020
Justin Min, it is your turn.

1595
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:30,564
Justin Min will go for an arrest.

1596
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:33,943
Investigate Station 9.

1597
01:08:34,026 --> 01:08:34,902
Wait.

1598
01:08:35,736 --> 01:08:37,571
Is he really coming?

1599
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:41,242
But he has a lot of lines to choose from.
He can go this way or this way.

1600
01:08:41,325 --> 01:08:42,576
How about going to Station 104?

1601
01:08:44,036 --> 01:08:47,665
Arrest. I know that's your instinct.

1602
01:08:47,748 --> 01:08:49,917
Arrest at Station 104.

1603
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,836
Red Team No. 1 fails to arrest.

1604
01:08:51,919 --> 01:08:53,129
Failed.

1605
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:56,674
That's amazing. He just saved us.

1606
01:08:56,757 --> 01:08:58,175
They won't know if they arrest.

1607
01:08:58,259 --> 01:09:01,512
I will investigate Station 41.
Then, Station 40.

1608
01:09:01,595 --> 01:09:04,682
I will investigate Stations 163 and 11.

1609
01:09:04,765 --> 01:09:08,435
I think Red Team has fallen apart.
See, they're moving this way.

1610
01:09:08,519 --> 01:09:10,396
Are some of them trying to catch?

1611
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:12,481
Shall I go to Station 44?

1612
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:16,068
Shall I make an arrest at Station 44?

1613
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:17,778
Yes, I'll make an arrest at Station 44.

1614
01:09:17,862 --> 01:09:21,073
Blue Team No. 2 moves to Station 44
and fails to make an arrest.

1615
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:22,491
Failed.

1616
01:09:22,575 --> 01:09:23,450
Arrest?

1617
01:09:23,534 --> 01:09:25,161
Does Blue know something?

1618
01:09:25,244 --> 01:09:26,704
I will investigate Station 158.

1619
01:09:26,787 --> 01:09:29,290
Then, move to Station 24 and investigate.

1620
01:09:29,373 --> 01:09:30,749
Nothing. No clues.

1621
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:32,209
I will investigate Station 18.

1622
01:09:32,293 --> 01:09:34,587
Kyuhyun moves
to Station 18 and investigates.

1623
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:35,588
Please.

1624
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:36,505
Check for a clue.

1625
01:09:36,589 --> 01:09:39,216
-Got one! Found one at Station 18.
-What, where?

1626
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:41,343
Hang on a sec, there's one at Station 18.

1627
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:43,095
Kyuhyun, would you like to share it?

1628
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:44,930
No, let's just go and tell them.

1629
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:47,641
Let's just tell Green. Okay.
We won't share it.

1630
01:09:47,725 --> 01:09:49,560
-But if you look here…
-Let's go to Station 17.

1631
01:09:49,643 --> 01:09:50,561
We have 12 seconds.

1632
01:09:50,644 --> 01:09:52,229
Investigate? Not arrest?

1633
01:09:52,313 --> 01:09:53,147
Arrest?

1634
01:09:53,230 --> 01:09:55,191
-Choose. Eight seconds.
-No, investigate!

1635
01:09:55,274 --> 01:09:57,651
-It'll be announced if it fails.
-Right. Investigate.

1636
01:09:57,735 --> 01:10:00,029
-Investigate Station 17.
-Moving to Station 17 and investigating.

1637
01:10:00,112 --> 01:10:01,405
-Check for a clue.
-Got one.

1638
01:10:01,488 --> 01:10:02,907
Right? Then, let's tell them.

1639
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:04,033
Purple.

1640
01:10:04,825 --> 01:10:06,035
Traces all around here.

1641
01:10:06,118 --> 01:10:07,286
I'm quite scared now.

1642
01:10:07,369 --> 01:10:08,495
Exactly.

1643
01:10:08,579 --> 01:10:11,415
I'm not sure who moves first.
Either this way or that.

1644
01:10:11,498 --> 01:10:13,250
But there was nothing here earlier.

1645
01:10:13,334 --> 01:10:15,336
Round 7 will now begin.

1646
01:10:15,419 --> 01:10:17,880
Thieves, please move your counters.

1647
01:10:17,963 --> 01:10:20,216
That's such a waste. Should I go for it?

1648
01:10:20,299 --> 01:10:21,926
We should grab it.

1649
01:10:22,009 --> 01:10:23,677
I think that will be safer.

1650
01:10:23,761 --> 01:10:25,512
Thief No. 2 to Station 153.

1651
01:10:26,013 --> 01:10:28,015
Let me check what's happening. Stay here.

1652
01:10:28,098 --> 01:10:30,893
Hang on a second.
I'll go and ask Blue about this.

1653
01:10:31,477 --> 01:10:32,895
Red Team police officers,

1654
01:10:32,978 --> 01:10:36,899
you have five minutes
to execute your moves in order.

1655
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:42,321
Where are you going?

1656
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:43,697
Se-dol!

1657
01:10:43,781 --> 01:10:46,408
Why are you bothering me so much?

1658
01:10:46,492 --> 01:10:47,493
For real?

1659
01:10:49,787 --> 01:10:51,538
More than anything…

1660
01:10:51,622 --> 01:10:54,959
We got them.
Got clues at Stations 17 and 18.

1661
01:10:55,042 --> 01:10:55,918
At Stations 17 and 18.

1662
01:10:56,001 --> 01:10:59,255
-We got clues. Stations 17 and 18.
-No wonder it looked so strange.

1663
01:11:03,634 --> 01:11:06,011
Hey! Why? Let me hear too.

1664
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:08,013
No, if we want to know their route…

1665
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:20,526
What the heck?

1666
01:11:20,609 --> 01:11:22,945
What happened?
Red turned around and went there?

1667
01:11:23,028 --> 01:11:24,697
Wait a sec, why did he go here?

1668
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:26,907
Going up this way means that…

1669
01:11:27,491 --> 01:11:29,535
Will he go down here? What will he do?

1670
01:11:29,618 --> 01:11:31,495
Do you think he's going up here?

1671
01:11:31,578 --> 01:11:33,622
-They're sharing clues.
-Really?

1672
01:11:33,706 --> 01:11:36,083
Yes, they're trying
to keep it a secret from us.

1673
01:11:36,166 --> 01:11:37,543
They're sharing intel.

1674
01:11:37,626 --> 01:11:40,421
We should assume they know
everything that has been revealed.

1675
01:11:40,504 --> 01:11:43,257
There are clues on Stations 17 and 18.

1676
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:44,883
-Here.
-No wonder.

1677
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:46,677
Then, that means it's not Kyuhyun.

1678
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:48,470
Because Kyuhyun keeps finding clues.

1679
01:11:48,554 --> 01:11:49,638
He's not corrupt.

1680
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:52,599
And Red isn't really sharing
any intel at all.

1681
01:11:52,683 --> 01:11:55,394
Because of the way
that guy is leading the team.

1682
01:11:55,477 --> 01:11:56,687
I'll move to Station 38.

1683
01:11:56,770 --> 01:11:58,564
I will investigate Station 145.

1684
01:11:58,647 --> 01:12:00,065
They keep moving up.

1685
01:12:00,983 --> 01:12:02,359
Son Eun-yu, it's your turn.

1686
01:12:02,443 --> 01:12:04,653
I will move to Station 69. Nothing here.

1687
01:12:04,737 --> 01:12:07,698
If there's nothing here at all,
it means they never came this way.

1688
01:12:07,781 --> 01:12:10,200
-Where's Station 36?
-There's been nothing here for ages.

1689
01:12:10,284 --> 01:12:12,328
Then, shall I go to the side?

1690
01:12:12,411 --> 01:12:14,330
I will move to Station 150
and investigate.

1691
01:12:14,413 --> 01:12:15,456
Station 150?

1692
01:12:15,539 --> 01:12:19,335
Don't do that.
That makes our route dangerous.

1693
01:12:19,418 --> 01:12:23,130
Kyuhyun, shoot for an arrest. Station 17.

1694
01:12:23,213 --> 01:12:24,840
But will they still be here? Arrest.

1695
01:12:24,923 --> 01:12:26,967
Arrest failed at Station 17.

1696
01:12:27,051 --> 01:12:28,635
Failed?

1697
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:32,598
If there have been two arrests here,
it'd be better to…

1698
01:12:32,681 --> 01:12:35,059
Just like us,
they know that they're close by.

1699
01:12:35,142 --> 01:12:36,352
Arrest at 16.

1700
01:12:36,435 --> 01:12:38,354
Moving to Station 16 and making an arrest.

1701
01:12:38,854 --> 01:12:39,855
Arrest failed.

1702
01:12:39,938 --> 01:12:42,900
Arrest failed?
They're trying everywhere around here.

1703
01:12:42,983 --> 01:12:44,360
We don't need to go to Station 15 now.

1704
01:12:44,443 --> 01:12:47,237
Green Team police officers,
please execute your moves.

1705
01:12:47,321 --> 01:12:50,032
Move to Station 14. Arrest failed.

1706
01:12:50,115 --> 01:12:52,618
Right, move to Station 105
and make an arrest.

1707
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:55,913
Move to Station 105. Arrest failed.

1708
01:12:55,996 --> 01:12:58,207
Are they in crackdown mode?
Shall I see what's up?

1709
01:12:58,290 --> 01:12:59,166
I'll be back.

1710
01:13:00,876 --> 01:13:03,045
-Thief Team, why…
-Are we almost there?

1711
01:13:03,128 --> 01:13:04,171
I love our meetings.

1712
01:13:04,254 --> 01:13:05,547
-You are too good.
-We close?

1713
01:13:05,631 --> 01:13:06,924
I'm scared to death.

1714
01:13:07,007 --> 01:13:08,050
Roughly, where are you?

1715
01:13:08,133 --> 01:13:10,052
I think you've caught our scent.

1716
01:13:10,135 --> 01:13:11,845
Can you just tell us who's corrupt?

1717
01:13:11,929 --> 01:13:13,263
I'm in danger.

1718
01:13:13,347 --> 01:13:14,765
If I tell you…

1719
01:13:14,848 --> 01:13:17,184
Can you retreat a bit?

1720
01:13:17,267 --> 01:13:18,519
Retreat what?

1721
01:13:18,602 --> 01:13:21,313
I'll expose one, so please move away.

1722
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:22,564
Move them down.

1723
01:13:22,648 --> 01:13:23,774
Bring all of them down?

1724
01:13:23,857 --> 01:13:25,776
I guess you're up top somewhere.

1725
01:13:25,859 --> 01:13:26,902
Maybe the opposite.

1726
01:13:26,985 --> 01:13:28,320
Tell us who it is on our team.

1727
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:29,738
They're not here right now.

1728
01:13:30,781 --> 01:13:31,657
For real?

1729
01:13:35,327 --> 01:13:36,662
I told you.

1730
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,206
Can we trust him?

1731
01:13:39,289 --> 01:13:41,583
Tinno, could you call So-hui?

1732
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:42,543
Really?

1733
01:13:42,626 --> 01:13:44,962
But don't you think
she looked so innocent?

1734
01:13:45,045 --> 01:13:46,088
Right?

1735
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:53,345
I asked him to call So-hui
to come out, but he didn't.

1736
01:13:54,012 --> 01:13:55,973
It might all be nonsense.

1737
01:13:56,056 --> 01:13:57,057
Exactly.

1738
01:13:58,725 --> 01:14:00,227
I will investigate Station 37.

1739
01:14:00,310 --> 01:14:03,105
Please. It's time we got something.

1740
01:14:03,188 --> 01:14:04,857
I'm praying.

1741
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:08,610
We've got one, a yellow one.
I'll go for an arrest at Station 37.

1742
01:14:08,694 --> 01:14:09,695
Please.

1743
01:14:10,779 --> 01:14:13,031
Arrest failed at Station 37.

1744
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:17,619
They're closing in.

1745
01:14:17,703 --> 01:14:21,248
So-hui, is CHUU
the corrupt one on the Blue Team?

1746
01:14:21,331 --> 01:14:23,208
Is it CHUU?

1747
01:14:27,838 --> 01:14:30,674
I'm feeling nervous.
Now, I don't trust anyone.

1748
01:14:32,426 --> 01:14:34,052
Why are you asking So-hui?

1749
01:14:34,136 --> 01:14:36,221
That marks the end of Round 7.

1750
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:38,515
Round 8 will now begin.

1751
01:14:38,599 --> 01:14:40,684
-Thieves, you have three minutes
-She doesn't answer.

1752
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:42,936
-to move your counters.
-Too many people here.

1753
01:14:43,770 --> 01:14:44,897
It's our turn.

1754
01:14:48,358 --> 01:14:50,277
I feel so bad,
even when we have no choice.

1755
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:52,029
Yes, but this is The Devil's Plan.

1756
01:14:52,112 --> 01:14:54,031
Right now, we're thieves.
We have to steal.

1757
01:14:54,114 --> 01:14:57,242
Next is Blue. Then, Green.
Then, Red. Red goes last.

1758
01:14:57,326 --> 01:15:00,537
Maybe I do something crazy and go here?

1759
01:15:00,621 --> 01:15:03,999
That does seem quite risky.

1760
01:15:04,082 --> 01:15:05,209
-Immediate arrest?
-Yes.

1761
01:15:05,292 --> 01:15:06,585
I don't think he'd do that.

1762
01:15:06,668 --> 01:15:08,921
-No, it's Justin.
-Right, Justin.

1763
01:15:09,004 --> 01:15:10,714
Then, should I try to fake them out?

1764
01:15:10,797 --> 01:15:12,966
It's a big gamble.

1765
01:15:13,050 --> 01:15:14,551
No, let's do it.

1766
01:15:14,635 --> 01:15:16,470
-Are you sure?
-Yes, let's roll the dice.

1767
01:15:16,553 --> 01:15:18,347
-Who are No. 2 and 3 on the Red Team?
-I'm No. 2.

1768
01:15:18,430 --> 01:15:20,474
No. 2, then 7high is No. 3, right?

1769
01:15:20,557 --> 01:15:22,142
And you didn't find any clues?

1770
01:15:22,226 --> 01:15:23,685
-Nothing.
-Really?

1771
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:25,979
Did a clue come out
at Station 38 just now?

1772
01:15:26,063 --> 01:15:27,064
-We don't know.
-Who's No. 2?

1773
01:15:27,147 --> 01:15:28,607
Just go to Station 38.

1774
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:31,151
Red claims
they've never found a clue at Station 38.

1775
01:15:31,235 --> 01:15:32,819
7high is there.

1776
01:15:32,903 --> 01:15:34,112
Really?

1777
01:15:34,655 --> 01:15:36,114
Then, that means he's lying.

1778
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:38,158
Okay, I understand.

1779
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:41,537
Blue Team police officers,
please execute your moves.

1780
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:43,872
Do you think Blue will retreat? No, right?

1781
01:15:43,956 --> 01:15:45,749
-I don't trust them.
-They'll go up.

1782
01:15:45,832 --> 01:15:47,376
I will investigate Station 175.

1783
01:15:47,459 --> 01:15:48,752
I will investigate Station 131.

1784
01:15:49,336 --> 01:15:50,379
No clues.

1785
01:15:51,088 --> 01:15:52,339
CHUU isn't going down.

1786
01:15:52,422 --> 01:15:53,465
Do you trust Tinno?

1787
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:55,926
-I don't trust him.
-I'll go to 1. I don't trust him.

1788
01:15:56,009 --> 01:15:58,929
Who's that? We told them to go down,
and they're coming up.

1789
01:15:59,012 --> 01:16:00,430
I will go to Station 52
and then, Station 51.

1790
01:16:00,514 --> 01:16:02,266
Station 51. Investigate 51.

1791
01:16:02,349 --> 01:16:04,351
Nothing. No clues.
They're not on this line.

1792
01:16:04,434 --> 01:16:05,852
Lee Se-dol, it's your turn.

1793
01:16:05,936 --> 01:16:07,271
I will investigate where I am.

1794
01:16:07,354 --> 01:16:08,689
Please check for a clue.

1795
01:16:09,731 --> 01:16:10,816
There's a clue.

1796
01:16:10,899 --> 01:16:13,110
-They're nearby.
-They've been moving around here.

1797
01:16:13,193 --> 01:16:14,444
We don't know which way they went.

1798
01:16:14,528 --> 01:16:15,529
Four minutes left.

1799
01:16:15,612 --> 01:16:18,907
Investigate Station 104
and if something comes up, I'll go down.

1800
01:16:18,991 --> 01:16:21,785
-I will investigate Station 104.
-Moving to 104 and investigating.

1801
01:16:21,868 --> 01:16:23,370
Please be somewhere nearby.

1802
01:16:23,453 --> 01:16:24,830
To Station 104 and investigating.

1803
01:16:24,913 --> 01:16:26,873
-Station 104?
-They're coming up this way.

1804
01:16:27,708 --> 01:16:28,667
There's a clue.

1805
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:30,627
-Wow.
-Okay, amazing.

1806
01:16:30,711 --> 01:16:31,962
-That's great.
-Okay. Arrest.

1807
01:16:32,045 --> 01:16:33,130
-Stations 103 and 104.
-Awesome.

1808
01:16:33,213 --> 01:16:34,965
Jeong Hyun-gyu, it's your turn.

1809
01:16:35,048 --> 01:16:38,635
The Red Team already said
that there was no clue at Station 38.

1810
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:39,845
Shall I check again?

1811
01:16:39,928 --> 01:16:42,681
We said we were going to Station 38.
We made a decision. Let's go.

1812
01:16:42,764 --> 01:16:44,349
Investigate Station 38.

1813
01:16:44,433 --> 01:16:46,143
They're going to check here.

1814
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:47,769
No clue at Station 38.

1815
01:16:48,562 --> 01:16:49,396
There isn't?

1816
01:16:49,479 --> 01:16:50,772
-There really wasn't.
-That's a shock.

1817
01:16:50,856 --> 01:16:53,525
Then what the heck is wrong with Red?
That wasn't even a lie.

1818
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:55,777
I'll head to Station 37
and make an arrest.

1819
01:16:55,861 --> 01:16:57,195
Please!

1820
01:16:57,279 --> 01:16:59,364
Arrest failed at Station 37.

1821
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:01,199
I'll go for arrests
at Stations 103 and 104.

1822
01:17:01,908 --> 01:17:04,119
Moved to Station 103. Arrest failed.

1823
01:17:04,202 --> 01:17:06,246
Moved to Station 104. Arrest failed.

1824
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:08,498
There we go.

1825
01:17:08,582 --> 01:17:10,626
Red. Last of all, it's Red.

1826
01:17:10,709 --> 01:17:13,879
Red Team police officers,
please execute your moves.

1827
01:17:13,962 --> 01:17:15,881
Please.

1828
01:17:18,008 --> 01:17:19,468
Move. Just move.

1829
01:17:19,551 --> 01:17:22,262
Even if you find a clue,
just move to Station 57.

1830
01:17:24,806 --> 01:17:27,184
Red Team No. 1 moves to Station 57.

1831
01:17:29,311 --> 01:17:30,562
Your gamble paid off.

1832
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:33,899
The "right under their nose" strategy.

1833
01:17:33,982 --> 01:17:35,817
Investigate Station 56.

1834
01:17:36,568 --> 01:17:39,071
Red Team No. 1 moves to Station 56.

1835
01:17:42,532 --> 01:17:43,950
There's nothing there.

1836
01:17:44,034 --> 01:17:44,993
Nothing.

1837
01:17:45,077 --> 01:17:46,370
Nothing?

1838
01:17:46,453 --> 01:17:48,914
I will make an arrest at Station 37.

1839
01:17:48,997 --> 01:17:52,042
Why did he do that? That's so…
I mean, aren't we on the same turn?

1840
01:17:52,125 --> 01:17:53,794
The thieves couldn't have moved.

1841
01:17:53,877 --> 01:17:55,462
What's going on now?

1842
01:17:55,545 --> 01:17:58,006
That's 7high, right? No. 3?

1843
01:17:58,090 --> 01:18:00,717
That concludes Round 8.

1844
01:18:00,801 --> 01:18:03,011
Round 9 will now begin.

1845
01:18:03,095 --> 01:18:05,555
Green, Red, Blue. The order is important.

1846
01:18:05,639 --> 01:18:08,308
Still, we're luckily on the same spot,

1847
01:18:08,392 --> 01:18:09,976
so let's head in different directions.

1848
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:11,436
Shall I go to Station 164?

1849
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:12,813
Go there and investigate?

1850
01:18:12,896 --> 01:18:16,108
-No clue.
-So, it's not that direction.

1851
01:18:16,191 --> 01:18:17,275
Turn around and arrest.

1852
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:18,527
Try for another arrest?

1853
01:18:18,610 --> 01:18:20,654
Move to Station 104 and make an arrest.

1854
01:18:21,571 --> 01:18:22,614
Arrest failed.

1855
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:23,990
Jeong Hyun-gyu, it's your turn.

1856
01:18:24,074 --> 01:18:25,826
Move to Station 172 and investigate.

1857
01:18:27,035 --> 01:18:28,745
Got one. A yellow one.

1858
01:18:28,829 --> 01:18:30,455
-There's a clue?
-Yes, a yellow one.

1859
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:31,707
Crazy.

1860
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:33,959
Of course, there is. A whole bunch there.

1861
01:18:34,042 --> 01:18:35,711
They'll continue finding them.

1862
01:18:35,794 --> 01:18:37,379
Move to Station 74 and investigate.

1863
01:18:37,462 --> 01:18:38,380
Another clue.

1864
01:18:38,964 --> 01:18:40,340
Got one?

1865
01:18:40,424 --> 01:18:41,967
I did have my doubts about you.

1866
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:43,802
I told you to go down, but you came up.

1867
01:18:43,885 --> 01:18:46,054
Good job. You listened to me.

1868
01:18:46,138 --> 01:18:48,223
When I told you to go down, you did.
Thanks.

1869
01:18:48,306 --> 01:18:50,183
-Are you working together?
-Red Team police officers,

1870
01:18:50,267 --> 01:18:54,146
you have five minutes
to execute your moves in order.

1871
01:18:54,229 --> 01:18:55,856
You're miles away, right?

1872
01:18:55,939 --> 01:18:57,315
We're close, aren't we?

1873
01:18:58,525 --> 01:18:59,484
Are you sure?

1874
01:19:00,068 --> 01:19:01,903
Why is it so difficult?

1875
01:19:02,487 --> 01:19:05,782
I said that
because Blue is the most dangerous.

1876
01:19:08,326 --> 01:19:10,412
-You're definitely not corrupt?
-No. Are you?

1877
01:19:10,495 --> 01:19:12,664
Then, why are you against
going after CHUU?

1878
01:19:13,999 --> 01:19:15,208
What is he talking about?

1879
01:19:15,292 --> 01:19:17,502
She clearly looks
like she has been wronged.

1880
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:18,503
CHUU?

1881
01:19:18,587 --> 01:19:23,383
Between Ji-yeong and CHUU,
the probability is quite high.

1882
01:19:23,467 --> 01:19:25,385
-That's true.
-Then, why not pursue it?

1883
01:19:26,011 --> 01:19:29,473
Do you think
the thieves will give us reliable intel?

1884
01:19:29,556 --> 01:19:32,642
They're thieves.
Do you really believe everything they say?

1885
01:19:34,311 --> 01:19:36,229
When he came over and said,

1886
01:19:36,313 --> 01:19:37,898
"Thank you for going down."

1887
01:19:37,981 --> 01:19:39,274
-You believe him?
-Then?

1888
01:19:39,357 --> 01:19:43,403
Well, first, Tinno said
that CHUU is the corrupt officer,

1889
01:19:43,487 --> 01:19:44,863
but we're all working hard.

1890
01:19:44,946 --> 01:19:46,740
Who could be the corrupt one?

1891
01:19:46,823 --> 01:19:48,325
Arrest at Station 57.

1892
01:19:48,408 --> 01:19:49,409
Arrest failed.

1893
01:19:49,493 --> 01:19:50,368
Arrest at Station 34.

1894
01:19:50,452 --> 01:19:51,411
Arrest failed.

1895
01:19:51,495 --> 01:19:54,372
-I will make an arrest at Station 114.
-Right.

1896
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:55,373
Arrest failed.

1897
01:19:55,457 --> 01:19:56,792
Arrest failed.

1898
01:19:56,875 --> 01:19:58,627
Still, we know roughly where they are.

1899
01:19:58,710 --> 01:20:01,755
Blue Team police officers,
please execute your moves.

1900
01:20:01,838 --> 01:20:05,801
So, if I check here and here,
it will confirm they're not around here.

1901
01:20:05,884 --> 01:20:07,761
Right, and we can go back up.

1902
01:20:07,844 --> 01:20:08,929
I will investigate Station 50.

1903
01:20:09,012 --> 01:20:10,555
Moving to 50 and investigating.

1904
01:20:11,139 --> 01:20:13,600
Nothing. Nothing at Station 50.

1905
01:20:13,683 --> 01:20:15,685
-I'll investigate Station 135.
-Arrest? Investigate?

1906
01:20:15,769 --> 01:20:17,646
Nothing. There's nothing over here.

1907
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:19,815
It's time for Round 10.

1908
01:20:19,898 --> 01:20:22,234
Round 10 will now begin.

1909
01:20:22,317 --> 01:20:24,653
Thieves, please move your counters.

1910
01:20:24,736 --> 01:20:27,781
The game is
just one step away from ending.

1911
01:20:27,864 --> 01:20:32,494
Tinno and I had each secured five Pieces.

1912
01:20:32,577 --> 01:20:35,956
Currently, the thieves only need
two more Pieces to win.

1913
01:20:36,039 --> 01:20:38,875
If they get the Pieces
at Stations 9 and 29,

1914
01:20:38,959 --> 01:20:42,128
the game will end in their victory.

1915
01:20:42,212 --> 01:20:43,213
Round 10 is important.

1916
01:20:44,381 --> 01:20:46,508
First, this one definitely has
to go like this.

1917
01:20:48,176 --> 01:20:51,054
It's hard to guess this.
It won't be easy to go this way.

1918
01:20:51,137 --> 01:20:53,265
-I don't think they will.
-Definitely won't.

1919
01:20:53,348 --> 01:20:54,516
No clue about the Piece.

1920
01:20:54,599 --> 01:20:57,102
They haven't been here.
I think they'll search here.

1921
01:20:57,185 --> 01:20:58,436
Jeez. Who's No. 3?

1922
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:02,232
You know there are people
who do weird moves out of the blue.

1923
01:21:02,315 --> 01:21:03,358
Go.

1924
01:21:04,234 --> 01:21:06,069
Go bravely. It's a brave move.

1925
01:21:06,152 --> 01:21:09,072
The order is crucial. Red, Blue, Green.

1926
01:21:09,155 --> 01:21:10,490
Green is going last.

1927
01:21:11,157 --> 01:21:12,909
We can't give them any hints.

1928
01:21:16,204 --> 01:21:19,207
Red Team police officers,
please execute your moves.

1929
01:21:19,291 --> 01:21:21,418
Shouldn't Red No. 1
go to Station 57 and then 58?

1930
01:21:21,501 --> 01:21:23,378
-No, they just came from Station 58.
-They did?

1931
01:21:23,461 --> 01:21:25,422
No, shouldn't they go to Station 57
and then, Station 111?

1932
01:21:25,505 --> 01:21:26,965
You think that's better?

1933
01:21:27,048 --> 01:21:28,967
We can go to Justin and tell him.

1934
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:30,468
But Red is up first.

1935
01:21:30,552 --> 01:21:32,178
We need to rush because he's first.

1936
01:21:32,262 --> 01:21:33,138
Red!

1937
01:21:33,221 --> 01:21:35,056
-Where is the Red Team?
-Red.

1938
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:36,099
Wait!

1939
01:21:36,182 --> 01:21:37,559
Red? I have no idea either.

1940
01:21:37,642 --> 01:21:38,977
-Red, hold up!
-No. 1!

1941
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:40,353
-Hold up!
-Red No. 1!

1942
01:21:40,437 --> 01:21:41,271
Hold up!

1943
01:21:41,354 --> 01:21:42,439
Red, have you gone yet?

1944
01:21:42,522 --> 01:21:43,607
Justin, have you gone?

1945
01:21:43,690 --> 01:21:44,733
No, not yet.

1946
01:21:44,816 --> 01:21:46,526
Will you check Station 111 for us?

1947
01:21:46,610 --> 01:21:48,653
Please go up. Go straight up there.

1948
01:21:48,737 --> 01:21:50,155
Station 111?

1949
01:21:52,073 --> 01:21:53,867
I'll tell you. We were never there.

1950
01:21:53,950 --> 01:21:55,493
-Really?
-Go away.

1951
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:57,287
I hate you.

1952
01:21:57,370 --> 01:21:58,288
Go away!

1953
01:21:58,371 --> 01:21:59,497
I told you.

1954
01:21:59,581 --> 01:22:01,458
Weird to tell someone off
when we just met.

1955
01:22:01,541 --> 01:22:02,459
Station 56.

1956
01:22:02,542 --> 01:22:04,210
-We haven't checked Station 56.
-Arrest.

1957
01:22:06,713 --> 01:22:07,547
Wait.

1958
01:22:07,631 --> 01:22:09,132
Is he going for an arrest at Station 111?

1959
01:22:09,215 --> 01:22:11,217
I just heard him call
for an arrest at Station 56.

1960
01:22:11,301 --> 01:22:13,345
We told them to go to Station 111,
but they're at 56…

1961
01:22:13,428 --> 01:22:15,513
I think they listened to me.
We never went to Station 11.

1962
01:22:15,597 --> 01:22:16,640
Why would they…

1963
01:22:16,723 --> 01:22:19,267
Wow, have I been conned by Justin?

1964
01:22:19,351 --> 01:22:21,353
He's doing a great job.

1965
01:22:21,436 --> 01:22:23,897
Something is going
terribly wrong right now.

1966
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:25,899
It seems that they're not down below.

1967
01:22:25,982 --> 01:22:28,860
Then, where do we go?

1968
01:22:29,527 --> 01:22:30,987
Let me show you…

1969
01:22:31,071 --> 01:22:36,493
They were at Station 14 earlier.
I found clues at Stations 16, 17, and 18.

1970
01:22:36,576 --> 01:22:41,873
I thought about going down
or going to Station 132 via Station 14.

1971
01:22:42,666 --> 01:22:45,835
I've already checked Stations 52,
51, and 50. There was nothing.

1972
01:22:45,919 --> 01:22:47,879
I also checked Station 135. Nothing.

1973
01:22:47,963 --> 01:22:49,631
So, they can't be on that line.

1974
01:22:49,714 --> 01:22:52,425
Because CHUU also checked Station 132.

1975
01:22:52,509 --> 01:22:54,135
That means they're not here.

1976
01:22:54,219 --> 01:22:55,804
So, they must be somewhere there.

1977
01:22:56,805 --> 01:22:58,723
Right, according to the others…

1978
01:22:59,224 --> 01:23:01,101
They're not on this line.

1979
01:23:01,184 --> 01:23:02,185
They're not here?

1980
01:23:02,268 --> 01:23:03,520
They're not on this line.

1981
01:23:03,603 --> 01:23:07,190
Since they're definitely not on this line,
we have to go up here.

1982
01:23:07,774 --> 01:23:08,775
I'm not sure.

1983
01:23:09,776 --> 01:23:12,070
Frankly, I wasn't happy about that turn.

1984
01:23:17,033 --> 01:23:20,495
We were still discussing it,
but she suddenly made that move.

1985
01:23:20,578 --> 01:23:21,871
So, I'm a little…

1986
01:23:21,955 --> 01:23:23,289
Corrupt officer?

1987
01:23:24,374 --> 01:23:26,334
If we don't have any Pieces, I will.

1988
01:23:26,418 --> 01:23:27,669
We have to get at least one.

1989
01:23:27,752 --> 01:23:29,796
Yes. I'll accuse Ha-rin.

1990
01:23:29,879 --> 01:23:31,881
But I don't think
there is one on our team.

1991
01:23:31,965 --> 01:23:34,092
If there isn't, it can't be helped.

1992
01:23:39,931 --> 01:23:42,934
Green Team police officers,
please execute your moves.

1993
01:23:43,018 --> 01:23:44,352
Green…

1994
01:23:45,854 --> 01:23:48,148
We need to start praying.

1995
01:23:48,231 --> 01:23:49,065
Yes, you're right.

1996
01:23:49,149 --> 01:23:50,900
My heart is about to explode right now.

1997
01:23:51,526 --> 01:23:53,737
Please, No. 1 first. Se-dol.

1998
01:23:53,820 --> 01:23:56,114
This is driving me crazy now.

1999
01:23:56,990 --> 01:24:01,202
Stations 113 or 114? They might be here.

2000
01:24:01,286 --> 01:24:03,621
I don't know if we can trust
what the Red Team did.

2001
01:24:04,789 --> 01:24:06,332
Did they find a clue here?

2002
01:24:06,416 --> 01:24:08,168
There was a clue here.

2003
01:24:08,251 --> 01:24:10,545
And they came here to arrest,
but it failed.

2004
01:24:10,628 --> 01:24:12,047
Arrest. No investigation.

2005
01:24:12,130 --> 01:24:13,465
They only made an arrest?

2006
01:24:13,548 --> 01:24:17,302
So it's not certain.
There's no clue here right now.

2007
01:24:18,762 --> 01:24:20,972
But I think
they would have escaped already.

2008
01:24:22,307 --> 01:24:24,059
I think there will be something here.

2009
01:24:24,601 --> 01:24:25,602
Shall we investigate?

2010
01:24:25,685 --> 01:24:26,770
Over here?

2011
01:24:28,313 --> 01:24:30,273
Let's turn over some stones.

2012
01:24:30,356 --> 01:24:31,983
We haven't done Station 174.

2013
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:32,901
Let's go for it.

2014
01:24:32,984 --> 01:24:35,278
We haven't done Station 174, right?

2015
01:24:35,361 --> 01:24:37,113
I will move to Station 174
and investigate.

2016
01:24:37,197 --> 01:24:38,323
Please check for a clue.

2017
01:24:40,742 --> 01:24:42,410
-Is there one? No?
-No.

2018
01:24:42,494 --> 01:24:44,788
Move to Station 58 and investigate.

2019
01:24:47,707 --> 01:24:48,583
There is one.

2020
01:24:48,666 --> 01:24:52,420
Wait. If there's a clue at Station 58,
that means they went this way.

2021
01:24:52,504 --> 01:24:53,338
This way.

2022
01:24:54,214 --> 01:24:55,215
Running out of time.

2023
01:24:55,298 --> 01:24:57,342
Did they come here now? Do you think?

2024
01:24:57,425 --> 01:24:58,843
I think they went a bit more.

2025
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:01,012
They probably didn't come this way, right?

2026
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:03,389
Then, should I go up a bit? Like this?

2027
01:25:12,065 --> 01:25:14,609
Good job. Seriously.

2028
01:25:14,692 --> 01:25:16,236
I'm really glad
I played so many board games.

2029
01:25:16,319 --> 01:25:17,153
Honestly.

2030
01:25:17,237 --> 01:25:19,322
That concludes Round 10.

2031
01:25:19,405 --> 01:25:22,534
At present, the thieves have secured
a total of ten Pieces.

2032
01:25:23,618 --> 01:25:26,079
We couldn't finish it
and lost 20 million won.

2033
01:25:26,162 --> 01:25:28,456
Sorry to whoever the winner will be.

2034
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:30,500
What is Red's goal here?

2035
01:25:30,583 --> 01:25:31,793
No idea. We agree.

2036
01:25:31,876 --> 01:25:33,169
I think someone's conspiring.

2037
01:25:33,253 --> 01:25:35,004
Does Red get anything if they win?

2038
01:25:35,088 --> 01:25:36,548
No, they must have conspired.

2039
01:25:36,631 --> 01:25:38,383
At least one of us is corrupt.

2040
01:25:38,466 --> 01:25:40,718
Seriously, they must be so clever.

2041
01:25:40,802 --> 01:25:43,388
Honestly, I really won't say anything.

2042
01:25:43,471 --> 01:25:44,722
You already did.

2043
01:25:44,806 --> 01:25:47,016
-Tell us the truth now.
-You won't vote?

2044
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:48,143
Of course, you'll vote.

2045
01:25:48,226 --> 01:25:51,563
But I'm pretty sure
it's neither me nor Kyuhyun.

2046
01:25:51,646 --> 01:25:54,357
I'm here vouching for myself.

2047
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:55,942
Time is up.

2048
01:25:56,025 --> 01:25:58,111
Round 11 will now begin.

2049
01:25:58,611 --> 01:26:00,655
20 million won has been deducted.

2050
01:26:00,738 --> 01:26:02,866
If the game ends this round,

2051
01:26:02,949 --> 01:26:05,451
the prize fund will stand
at 80 million won.

2052
01:26:05,535 --> 01:26:09,622
The thieves now have
three minutes to move their counters.

2053
01:26:09,706 --> 01:26:10,832
A stylish finish.

2054
01:26:10,915 --> 01:26:14,502
Thief No. 2 will move
to Station 30 via 29.

2055
01:26:14,586 --> 01:26:17,505
The thieves have secured 12 Pieces.

2056
01:26:17,589 --> 01:26:19,424
Wow, let's go!

2057
01:26:19,507 --> 01:26:20,967
-Huh?
-It's all over.

2058
01:26:21,050 --> 01:26:22,927
-It's over.
-It's over now.

2059
01:26:23,011 --> 01:26:24,721
Then, do we have to vote?

2060
01:26:24,804 --> 01:26:27,932
From this moment on,
players may not leave their rooms.

2061
01:26:28,016 --> 01:26:30,935
The vote for the corrupt officer
will now commence.

2062
01:26:31,019 --> 01:26:33,521
The police officers on each team
must write down

2063
01:26:33,605 --> 01:26:36,816
the name of the player they suspect
as their team's corrupt officer

2064
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:38,443
on a piece of paper

2065
01:26:38,526 --> 01:26:40,069
and place it in the ballot box.

2066
01:26:41,029 --> 01:26:44,240
If you believe there is
no corrupt officer on your team,

2067
01:26:44,324 --> 01:26:46,492
you may write down "none."

2068
01:26:47,660 --> 01:26:50,455
The player on each team
who garners the most votes

2069
01:26:50,538 --> 01:26:52,624
will be accused
of being the corrupt officer.

2070
01:26:52,707 --> 01:26:56,794
If the majority of votes are for "none,"
no one will be accused.

2071
01:26:56,878 --> 01:26:59,797
All "none" teams will not be awarded
any additional Pieces,

2072
01:26:59,881 --> 01:27:02,300
even if there is
no corrupt officer on their team.

2073
01:27:02,383 --> 01:27:05,386
There's no point voting for "none."
You have to vote for someone.

2074
01:27:05,470 --> 01:27:07,222
You have to pick one person.

2075
01:27:07,305 --> 01:27:09,599
Personally, I don't think we have
one on our team…

2076
01:27:09,682 --> 01:27:12,393
You need to choose someone now.
We'll take it in turns.

2077
01:27:12,477 --> 01:27:15,146
I'm still stuck at the beginning
when we chose our roles.

2078
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:17,482
-Are you a corrupt officer?
-I must be one or the other.

2079
01:27:17,565 --> 01:27:18,566
Se-dol, what are you?

2080
01:27:18,650 --> 01:27:21,194
Why didn't you just say you were ordinary?

2081
01:27:21,277 --> 01:27:23,029
-Oh, for me too…
-I didn't understand.

2082
01:27:23,112 --> 01:27:24,781
That troubled me as well.

2083
01:27:24,864 --> 01:27:27,283
I don't think we have one,
but if I have to choose--

2084
01:27:27,367 --> 01:27:29,827
If that's the reason,
I don't think that's right.

2085
01:27:29,911 --> 01:27:34,624
If I acted suspiciously,
then, I can accept that as a reason.

2086
01:27:34,707 --> 01:27:38,962
But honestly, I think we should choose
Ha-rin for that reason.

2087
01:27:39,045 --> 01:27:41,673
I don't think I've done
anything suspicious.

2088
01:27:41,756 --> 01:27:43,883
If I'm being honest,
I had my doubts about you.

2089
01:27:44,467 --> 01:27:47,011
Because I don't know either of you.
That's why.

2090
01:27:48,346 --> 01:27:50,348
I don't think it's either one of you.

2091
01:27:50,431 --> 01:27:52,100
I have no idea who it might be.

2092
01:27:54,310 --> 01:27:56,521
I'm certain we have
a corrupt officer on our team.

2093
01:27:56,604 --> 01:27:58,106
Me too.

2094
01:27:58,189 --> 01:28:00,775
It's not me. I swear it's not me.

2095
01:28:02,235 --> 01:28:04,404
Can you just let me know
if there's one on my team?

2096
01:28:04,487 --> 01:28:05,571
There is.

2097
01:28:05,655 --> 01:28:07,448
-Tell us who it is on our team.
-They're not here right now.

2098
01:28:07,532 --> 01:28:09,325
-For real?
-I told you.

2099
01:28:09,409 --> 01:28:11,953
-That's why…
-That's a bluff.

2100
01:28:12,036 --> 01:28:15,498
What if it's wrong? Honestly, it's not me.

2101
01:28:15,581 --> 01:28:18,126
But why would
So-hui bluff about that to me?

2102
01:28:18,209 --> 01:28:20,211
Exactly, so we definitely have one.

2103
01:28:20,295 --> 01:28:23,172
She wouldn't tell me who it was,
but she said there was one.

2104
01:28:23,256 --> 01:28:27,552
I never even went near them.
With the thieves. That's all I ever said.

2105
01:28:27,635 --> 01:28:30,555
Yeah, we didn't even talk to the thieves.

2106
01:28:30,638 --> 01:28:31,806
Both of you did.

2107
01:28:31,889 --> 01:28:33,558
You're miles away, aren't you?

2108
01:28:33,641 --> 01:28:34,726
We're close, aren't we?

2109
01:28:37,729 --> 01:28:39,397
Right, so one of you two…

2110
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:43,234
-Really. That's the situation--
-Who are the possible two?

2111
01:28:43,318 --> 01:28:44,777
Exactly, just spit it out.

2112
01:28:44,861 --> 01:28:46,529
I suspect Kyuhyun the most.

2113
01:28:46,612 --> 01:28:50,575
I think he's cooking something up
with Tinno and 7high.

2114
01:28:50,658 --> 01:28:52,827
It's hard to assess Kyuhyun's character.

2115
01:28:52,910 --> 01:28:55,121
When I asked So-hui if it was CHUU,

2116
01:28:55,204 --> 01:28:56,956
she didn't answer straight away.

2117
01:28:57,040 --> 01:29:01,169
So I took that as a positive sign.

2118
01:29:01,252 --> 01:29:02,295
Which two--

2119
01:29:02,378 --> 01:29:05,173
Because I was suspicious of CHUU

2120
01:29:05,256 --> 01:29:08,009
and Kyuhyun seemed to have
a connection with Tinno.

2121
01:29:08,092 --> 01:29:09,886
You actually talked to him more than me.

2122
01:29:09,969 --> 01:29:11,596
You're right. Exactly.

2123
01:29:11,679 --> 01:29:13,097
I never even talked to So-hui.

2124
01:29:13,181 --> 01:29:14,140
I never, either.

2125
01:29:14,223 --> 01:29:17,769
You heard what Tinno said
when he came out for those brief moments.

2126
01:29:17,852 --> 01:29:22,065
It felt like he was trying
to manipulate us a bit.

2127
01:29:22,148 --> 01:29:25,026
So I paid him no mind,
even with my doubts.

2128
01:29:25,109 --> 01:29:26,944
That's why I said it was probably nothing.

2129
01:29:27,653 --> 01:29:29,280
The vote will now commence.

2130
01:29:29,364 --> 01:29:31,366
Son Eun-yu, please cast your vote.

2131
01:29:32,325 --> 01:29:33,493
What do I do?

2132
01:29:38,289 --> 01:29:40,917
I voted for Kyuhyun.

2133
01:29:42,085 --> 01:29:43,795
The reason is

2134
01:29:43,878 --> 01:29:46,923
because CHUU keeps insisting it's not her.

2135
01:29:47,006 --> 01:29:48,007
I did too!

2136
01:29:48,091 --> 01:29:50,051
But you said there wasn't one at all.

2137
01:29:50,134 --> 01:29:53,805
So with nitpicking, I chose you.
I'm sorry, I had no choice.

2138
01:29:53,888 --> 01:29:55,223
-CHUU.
-Yes?

2139
01:30:01,020 --> 01:30:01,979
Dear me.

2140
01:30:02,063 --> 01:30:03,189
I'm sorry.

2141
01:30:10,071 --> 01:30:11,572
If I get this wrong…

2142
01:30:11,656 --> 01:30:12,990
Jeong Hyun-gyu.

2143
01:30:16,702 --> 01:30:17,912
Choi Hyun-joon.

2144
01:30:17,995 --> 01:30:19,205
Kim Ha-rin.

2145
01:30:19,288 --> 01:30:22,333
I'm sorry. I voted for Ji-yeong.

2146
01:30:22,417 --> 01:30:25,294
Because I was suspicious of her
since the beginning.

2147
01:30:25,378 --> 01:30:28,589
And I didn't vote for Kyuhyun
because we hardly talked to them.

2148
01:30:28,673 --> 01:30:31,092
I kept avoiding them.
I kept trying to guess.

2149
01:30:31,175 --> 01:30:34,303
I really have no idea.
I just went with my gut feeling.

2150
01:30:34,387 --> 01:30:36,556
Really?
Then, my choice just became easier.

2151
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:39,392
No, but think about it logically.

2152
01:30:39,475 --> 01:30:42,145
If CHUU were the corrupt one,

2153
01:30:42,228 --> 01:30:44,564
she wouldn't be acting irrationally now.

2154
01:30:44,647 --> 01:30:47,567
If she just picked Kyuhyun,
she would be safe.

2155
01:30:47,650 --> 01:30:49,694
I don't know, but I don't think it's CHUU.

2156
01:30:50,486 --> 01:30:51,696
Honestly.

2157
01:30:51,779 --> 01:30:53,781
Right. Both of you are too…

2158
01:30:53,865 --> 01:30:57,827
Apart from the intro, I haven't spoken
to anyone outside of this team.

2159
01:30:57,910 --> 01:30:59,996
-Except when we were together.
-That's true.

2160
01:31:00,079 --> 01:31:01,497
We were together the whole time.

2161
01:31:01,581 --> 01:31:03,166
I haven't spoken to anyone else.

2162
01:31:03,249 --> 01:31:04,834
That concludes the voting.

2163
01:31:06,836 --> 01:31:09,130
There's nothing to do now but wait.

2164
01:31:09,213 --> 01:31:11,591
You're talking to us as if you're certain,

2165
01:31:11,674 --> 01:31:14,469
but we're getting annoyed
because we know we're not.

2166
01:31:14,552 --> 01:31:15,887
It's not me.

2167
01:31:15,970 --> 01:31:17,096
I will write down "none."

2168
01:31:17,180 --> 01:31:20,099
But if this gets exposed
as a lie later, I won't let it go.

2169
01:31:20,183 --> 01:31:22,602
I really won't be able to let it go.

2170
01:31:22,685 --> 01:31:26,314
I'm so emotional.
I'm wondering, "Is this right?" Seriously.

2171
01:31:26,397 --> 01:31:28,149
We don't need to be doing all this.

2172
01:31:28,232 --> 01:31:30,985
Why must we get so annoyed as we talk?

2173
01:31:31,068 --> 01:31:33,446
At this point,
the person could have confessed,

2174
01:31:33,529 --> 01:31:35,239
but they didn't and instead,

2175
01:31:35,323 --> 01:31:37,116
we're irritated and exhausted.

2176
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:39,368
So now, I feel
like I should review what I know.

2177
01:31:39,452 --> 01:31:42,997
"Can I really believe what So-hui said?"

2178
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:44,165
So, "none"?

2179
01:31:44,248 --> 01:31:46,584
You know I'm tossing out
something big if I do.

2180
01:31:46,667 --> 01:31:49,212
If, after I trust this much,
I get backstabbed…

2181
01:31:49,295 --> 01:31:50,213
It's not you, is it?

2182
01:31:50,296 --> 01:31:51,255
It's not me.

2183
01:31:51,339 --> 01:31:53,174
Kang Ji-yeong, please cast your vote.

2184
01:31:53,257 --> 01:31:55,551
If I end up in the prison block like this,

2185
01:31:55,635 --> 01:31:58,095
I will make whoever it is pay.

2186
01:31:58,179 --> 01:32:01,933
Whoever it is, they're amazing.
Anyone on this team…

2187
01:32:02,016 --> 01:32:05,561
This team is done now.
We can never be a team again.

2188
01:32:05,645 --> 01:32:06,771
You know?

2189
01:32:12,151 --> 01:32:14,111
But if you're really not,
I will apologize.

2190
01:32:14,195 --> 01:32:15,905
You'll have to apologize.

2191
01:32:16,656 --> 01:32:18,241
This is so exhausting.

2192
01:32:19,575 --> 01:32:20,618
NONE

2193
01:32:21,661 --> 01:32:22,745
Kyuhyun.

2194
01:32:24,121 --> 01:32:25,498
Let's see how it turns out.

2195
01:32:25,581 --> 01:32:28,000
So this is why this show is so cruel.

2196
01:32:28,084 --> 01:32:29,752
And it's just the first game.

2197
01:32:34,465 --> 01:32:37,176
The vote
for the corrupt officer has concluded.

2198
01:32:37,260 --> 01:32:39,470
Please gather in the hall.

2199
01:32:39,554 --> 01:32:42,014
Time to go and get our report cards.

2200
01:32:43,808 --> 01:32:47,228
I will now announce
the results of Corrupt Police.

2201
01:32:47,311 --> 01:32:52,733
The game ended with neither
of the thieves being arrested.

2202
01:32:52,817 --> 01:32:55,820
The thieves have secured a total

2203
01:32:55,903 --> 01:32:57,196
of 12 Pieces.

2204
01:32:57,280 --> 01:32:58,155
Congratulations.

2205
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:00,449
I will give you six Pieces.

2206
01:33:00,533 --> 01:33:04,078
I will now announce
the results of the corrupt officer vote.

2207
01:33:09,584 --> 01:33:11,210
The Red Team

2208
01:33:11,294 --> 01:33:13,421
did not accuse anyone.

2209
01:33:14,255 --> 01:33:16,257
The Blue Team accused Kang Ji-yeong.

2210
01:33:17,341 --> 01:33:21,554
And the Green Team accused
Lee Se-dol of being the corrupt officer.

2211
01:33:23,139 --> 01:33:25,099
I was so surprised by the announcement.

2212
01:33:25,182 --> 01:33:26,642
VOTING RESULTS
NONE, JI-YEONG, SE-DOL

2213
01:33:26,726 --> 01:33:30,521
The others were also a bit suspicious
of Se-dol from the start…

2214
01:33:31,188 --> 01:33:33,357
The Red Team set us up.

2215
01:33:33,441 --> 01:33:35,776
Now, I will reveal the corrupt officers.

2216
01:33:35,860 --> 01:33:37,111
Please.

2217
01:33:38,779 --> 01:33:40,406
On the Red Team…

2218
01:33:40,489 --> 01:33:41,699
-Red is weird.
-Red is weird.

2219
01:33:41,782 --> 01:33:42,825
Are you done?

2220
01:33:42,908 --> 01:33:43,951
-Yes.
-Yes.

2221
01:33:44,035 --> 01:33:45,286
Do you trust 7high?

2222
01:33:46,412 --> 01:33:47,830
The corrupt officer was

2223
01:33:49,332 --> 01:33:50,166
no one.

2224
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:52,877
No one on Red…

2225
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:54,253
On the Green Team…

2226
01:33:54,337 --> 01:33:56,255
-Are you a corrupt officer?
-I must be one or the other.

2227
01:33:56,339 --> 01:33:58,215
I think we should choose Ha-rin…

2228
01:33:59,008 --> 01:34:00,426
I don't think we have one…

2229
01:34:00,509 --> 01:34:02,011
No, I don't think we do either.

2230
01:34:04,347 --> 01:34:05,598
It was Jeong Hyun-gyu.

2231
01:34:05,681 --> 01:34:07,350
Wow!

2232
01:34:08,017 --> 01:34:09,602
On the Blue Team…

2233
01:34:09,685 --> 01:34:11,646
Your expression was just so weird.

2234
01:34:11,729 --> 01:34:13,564
-They're not here right now.
-That's a bluff.

2235
01:34:13,648 --> 01:34:14,732
I swear it's not me.

2236
01:34:14,815 --> 01:34:16,359
Apart from the intro,

2237
01:34:16,442 --> 01:34:17,943
I haven't spoken to anyone…

2238
01:34:20,946 --> 01:34:22,198
It's Kyuhyun.

2239
01:36:01,839 --> 01:36:06,844
