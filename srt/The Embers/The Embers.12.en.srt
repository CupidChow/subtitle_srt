1
00:00:15,967 --> 00:00:21,370
(Yong'an Village, 2009)

2
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:28,839
So, let me say something.

3
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:31,679
Today is a good day.

4
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:33,439
First,

5
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:35,880
(Mr. Liao)
after everything we've gone through,

6
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,320
(Mr. Liao)
we've finally brought River Spirit back.

7
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,399
This past year, the weather
has been favorable,

8
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,759
and life has taken a turn
for the better.

9
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:46,600
We owe it all to Qi

10
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,240
for bringing us good fortune.

11
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:48,960
Right?

12
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:50,880
Liao, it's all thanks

13
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,240
to your decisive leadership.

14
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:54,350
You really stepped up.

15
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:56,600
Let's drink.

16
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,439
Thank you, thank you.

17
00:00:57,439 --> 00:00:58,000
Yes.

18
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,240
Thank you.

19
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,840
And second,

20
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,280
our Zhibai

21
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,719
is about to graduate.

22
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:12,619
(Su Pa)
He might even get assigned

23
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,280
(Su Pa)
to the Buhe Police Department.

24
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:15,959
Once he's back home,

25
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:19,159
he'll be officially Officer Liao.

26
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:20,319
Dad, come on.

27
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,180
I haven't even taken the first step yet.

28
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,740
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

29
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:25,079
Son,

30
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:27,079
(Mrs. Liao)
now you're acting modest?

31
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:28,960
With two young ladies here,

32
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:30,239
you're suddenly shy?

33
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:31,519
That's right.

34
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,920
Mr. Liao, Mrs. Liao,

35
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,760
here's to Zhibai

36
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:40,000
becoming a fair and just officer

37
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,079
in the future!

38
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:44,239
That's right.

39
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:44,760
Yes.

40
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,260
- Thanks, Ms. Meihua.
- Officer Liao.

41
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,070
Good luck!

42
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:53,120
Let's dig in.

43
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,000
Let's eat.

44
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:57,400
Thank you.

45
00:01:58,359 --> 00:01:59,079
Have some shrimp.

46
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:00,000
Thanks, ma'am.

47
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,280
We're

48
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,959
all family here.

49
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,120
You know,

50
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,020
maybe we should arrange an engagement

51
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,620
for Su Pa and Siyuan while we're at it.

52
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:08,719
No, no.

53
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,520
I'm going to be a police
like my brother when I grow up.

54
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,630
Who would want to marry you?

55
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,880
You're not even taller than me!

56
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,520
Says who?

57
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,570
You were definitely standing
on your toes last time.

58
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,590
Let's measure right now!

59
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:19,520
Sit down.

60
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,709
Show some respect.

61
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:21,490
If you keep this up,

62
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,920
I'll give you an extra set
of math problems over summer break.

63
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,150
Su Pa's mother isn't here,

64
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,719
so don't joke around like that.

65
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:27,960
Got it.

66
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,000
I won't say it again.

67
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:32,319
Su Pa, Siyuan, eat up!

68
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,759
Eat up.

69
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:34,680
Go on.

70
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,599
Come on.

71
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:36,360
Have a shrimp.

72
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,680
Thank you, Mrs. Liao.

73
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:38,560
Su Pa.

74
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:40,680
Let's go home.

75
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:43,840
Mom is calling me.

76
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,879
I should go.

77
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,680
Bye.

78
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:54,520
Just go back to your food.

79
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:57,000
Qi.

80
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:58,479
Have some more.

81
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,319
Try this.

82
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:01,919
Leave this to me.

83
00:04:36,554 --> 00:04:44,890
=The Embers=

84
00:04:46,192 --> 00:04:48,930

=Chapter 3=
=Yong'an Village=

86
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,560
Li Zhi,

87
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:12,959
what did you say to my mom?

88
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:15,920
I just told her that I like Liao Siyuan.

89
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,360
And I also said

90
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,480
that I secretly planned
this whole camping trip.

91
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,639
You guys had no idea.

92
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:21,439
Oh,

93
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,480
and I said

94
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,120
that I know a lot has happened lately,

95
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,879
and Siyuan's been feeling down.

96
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:27,240
Love, after all,

97
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,360
is the best medicine
for a wounded heart.

98
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,000
That's enough.

99
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:32,519
Am I wrong?

100
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,140
So you do take the initiative sometimes.

101
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,920
I do not.

102
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,040
Sure you don't.

103
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,279
Xia, will you drive safely?

104
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,439
Blame the road.

105
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:44,680
What can I do?

106
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,160
Be careful.

107
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,319
Xia, I know

108
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:51,839
you're all invested in

109
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,199
my brother's love life,

110
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,839
but can you spare a thought for me?

111
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,480
I get carsick, you know.

112
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:15,420
(Yong'an Village)

113
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:21,920
Xia,

114
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,040
are we almost there?

115
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:23,920
Almost.

116
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,319
Why did the fog get
so thick all of a sudden?

117
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,310
There's a river at the entrance
of Yong'an Village.

118
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,240
Every morning when we pass through,

119
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,540
the fog gets really dense.

120
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,279
What is that?

121
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:38,480
Oh, that...

122
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:39,959
Watch out!

123
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,879
Ugh, what a bad omen!

124
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:52,639
We got into a car accident
before we even left the village.

125
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,000
Do people in your village
even know how to drive?

126
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:58,800
Are you all blind behind the wheel?

127
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,560
I'm telling you right now,

128
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:01,680
this is your fault!

129
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,070
If I hadn't reacted fast enough,

130
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,920
your car would've been
the one getting hit.

131
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,199
My dashcam caught everything.

132
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,240
This one's on you.

133
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,519
(Jie En, Ba Song)
Is this woman from your village too?

134
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,800
No manners at all.

135
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,600
Who are you calling rude?

136
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,600
Manners depend on the person,

137
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,280
and you sure aren't acting like one.

138
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,319
What's that supposed to mean?

139
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,240
If I'm not a person, then what am I?

140
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:23,800
How should I know?

141
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:25,439
That's your problem to figure out.

142
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:28,560
You really have no manners at all!

143
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,120
Did you hear him?

144
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,879
Liao Zhibai?

145
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,920
You're alive?

146
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,680
Stop staring.

147
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:38,600
That's Liao Siyuan.

148
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,000
For a second,
I thought River Spirit actually

149
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,000
brought a ghost back.

150
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,560
Why are you two back?

151
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,780
Worried the village isn't
unlucky enough already?

152
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,959
Looks like that River Spirit

153
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,680
your dad prayed to
isn't too fond of you.

154
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,620
After that crash,
you can't enter the village.

155
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:01,279
Get lost.

156
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,600
If it weren't for you,

157
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,380
we wouldn't have
crashed in the first place.

158
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,920
If the River Spirit wants revenge,

159
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,120
he should start with you.

160
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:07,920
Enough, Xia.

161
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,280
Don't waste your breath on him.

162
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,280
Just call the police

163
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,340
and get the car fixed.

164
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,020
Okay.

165
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,800
Jie En.

166
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:16,199
Jie En,

167
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:17,279
come here.

168
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,040
You expect me to just
stand here and wait

169
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,560
while you fix your car?

170
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:26,519
I came here to buy from you!

171
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,279
I'm the customer, your god, you know.

172
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,120
Is this how you treat your god?

173
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,480
Yes, you're God.

174
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,490
I think there's
a gas station over there.

175
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,840
I'll go check it out.

176
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,240
I'll call for a tow right away.
It won't take long.

177
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,270
Hurry up, please.

178
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:47,240
Hello?

179
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,080
Is anyone in there?

180
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:10,600
Hello?

181
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,080
Hello?

182
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,039
Anyone around?

183
00:09:30,005 --> 00:09:33,680
(Karma)

184
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,240
Hello?

185
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:49,600
Sorry to bother you.

186
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,159
Our car got hit.

187
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,480
Can someone come to take a look?

188
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,600
Hello?

189
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,399
Granny,

190
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,360
you're here.

191
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:21,840
What's going on?

192
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,080
Su Pa.

193
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,240
I want to buy something.

194
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,000
Granny,

195
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,120
please wait here.

196
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,200
Mom.

197
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:53,720
Are you okay, Mom?

198
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,000
Su Pa,

199
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:57,759
where is my hairpin?

200
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:01,480
Who are you?

201
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:04,240
Hi.

202
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:06,639
We were on our way into the village,

203
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,900
but we got into
an accident on the bridge

204
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,990
and accidentally crashed
into River Spirit's statue.

205
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,200
Do you know if there's anyone
around who can fix cars?

206
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,940
You crashed into
the River Spirit's statue?

207
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:44,000
Is there anyone around?

208
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:47,159
I'm thirsty!

209
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:03,960
You're not allowed in!

210
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,679
We said no entry, and that's final.

211
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,519
You cannot come in.

212
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,039
No, you have to leave.

213
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,720
We're not outsiders!

214
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,860
We're from this village too.

215
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,720
Oh, spare us.

216
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,380
You outsiders offended the River Spirit,

217
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,740
and now you think you can waltz in?

218
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:15,360
Get out!

219
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,440
Get lost! Now!

220
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:18,680
Do any of you even know them?

221
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,870
No. We don't know him.

222
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:20,720
Never met them before.

223
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:22,000
My dad is Liao Nianguo.

224
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,080
Get out! Get out of here!

225
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,080
Get out!

226
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:24,919
Go away!

227
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:26,200
He built this bridge.

228
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,580
He's the one who brought
the River Spirit's statue here.

229
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,720
I've been gone for ten years.

230
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,220
How does that make me an outsider?

231
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,279
Liao Siyuan.

232
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,120
Su Pa?

233
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:37,840
Siyuan!

234
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:39,919
Siyuan!

235
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,879
Little Siyuan!

236
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:48,600
It really is you.

237
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:50,500
It's been ten years,
and you finally came back!

238
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,400
Mr. Na Wa.

239
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:52,519
Yes, I'm back.

240
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:53,759
They won't let us in.

241
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:54,799
He's one of us.

242
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,120
Alright, everyone, break it up!

243
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:56,840
He's one of us.

244
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,200
Hold on.

245
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:00,240
Even if he is one of us,

246
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,780
they crashed into River Spirit's statue.

247
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,220
They can't waltz into the village.

248
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,270
Right. They can't go in.

249
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,600
That's right. They cannot enter.

250
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,519
Everyone, calm down

251
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:08,679
and listen to me.

252
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,840
Here's what we'll do.

253
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,480
He'll stay at my place for now.

254
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,670
If anything happens...

255
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:14,200
Sir.

256
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:16,919
And them too.

257
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,720
They'll stay at my place for now.

258
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,440
If anything happens,
my family will take responsibility.

259
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,140
I promise, it won't
affect the rest of you.

260
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:25,159
Does that work?

261
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:26,960
Now, break it up!

262
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,120
Since Na Wa says so,

263
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,120
alright then.

264
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,080
Well...

265
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,720
But if anything happens, it's on you.

266
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,240
I swear to the River Spirit,
I'll take responsibility.

267
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,350
I said it, and I mean it.

268
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,480
No one else will be affected.

269
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,279
Now, everyone, just go home.

270
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:41,240
Go on now.

271
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,039
Scatter.

272
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,519
Go on.

273
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,120
I called you to fix my car,

274
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:47,159
not to embarrass me!

275
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,120
I am here to fix your car.

276
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:51,799
Wait, that's your car?

277
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,240
Wow, fancy ride.

278
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,860
I rushed over here,

279
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,560
so I might not have
the right tools on me.

280
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,560
How about this?

281
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,040
I'll call the best mechanic
to take care of it for you.

282
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,399
No need to worry, okay?

283
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,840
Please be patient.

284
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,600
Let's go.

285
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,679
Let's go home for dinner.

286
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:08,120
Come on.

287
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,120
I'll get you a tow truck.

288
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:10,600
Siyuan,

289
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,390
you've grown so tall in a flash.

290
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:14,960
Who is this?

291
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:15,840
My sister.

292
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:17,200
Qi Xia?

293
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:17,639
Yes.

294
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:18,360
Mr. Na Wa.

295
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,790
You haven't changed a bit.
You're still beautiful.

296
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:22,480
Liao Siyuan.

297
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,120
Look at you.

298
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,080
The first thing you do
is looking for your wife.

299
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,140
What did you say?

300
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,240
Quit making things up.

301
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,000
I came back for the memorial,

302
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,140
and I just happened
to run into Su Pa here.

303
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:39,320
I was just kidding.

304
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,159
Su Pa, why don't you
come over for dinner too?

305
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,780
Liao Siyuan, see you at our old haunt.

306
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,080
You shared a secret code?

307
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:51,919
Mr. Na Wa,

308
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,480
are you sure we're not imposing?

309
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,759
There are many of us.

310
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,300
Don't worry about it.

311
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,950
If it weren't for Siyuan's dad starting

312
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,460
that fruit processing plant back then,

313
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,620
I would've starved to death
during those drought years.

314
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,260
He was a good man. It's such a shame...

315
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,480
Let's not dwell on the past.

316
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:08,879
I talk too much.

317
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,399
Peace of mind is a blessing.

318
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,880
Peace of mind is a blessing.

319
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:13,679
Let's go.

320
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,389
Come on.

321
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,380
Let's go home for dinner.

322
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,399
Come on.

323
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,200
Hey,

324
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,440
I couldn't stop them.

325
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,320
Xia,

326
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:41,120
was that Jie En always
such an arrogant jerk?

327
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,200
He acts like he's got a screw loose.

328
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,879
He's been like that since I was a kid.

329
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,240
It's no surprise he's
making things hard for you.

330
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,300
After the Liao family had
their troubles back then,

331
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,240
he took over
their old dried fruit factory.

332
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,060
"Took over" was already
a nice way to put it,

333
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,600
truth is, he straight-up snatched it.

334
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,159
Siyuan wasn't around, so he just

335
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,480
claimed it for himself.

336
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,240
Now that you're back,
he's probably feeling guilty.

337
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,600
I've never seen him actually

338
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:05,639
worship the River Spirit before.

339
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:07,000
This is just the guilty party

340
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,039
acting like the victim.

341
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:09,759
By the way,

342
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:11,759
what's the deal with this River Spirit?

343
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:13,759
My dad brought it here.

344
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:16,279
I remember when I was a kid,

345
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,860
there was a drought for a few years.

346
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,750
After the River Spirit was invited,

347
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,100
it finally started raining.

348
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,879
That's right!

349
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:24,890
We've relied on
River Spirit's blessing ever since.

350
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,640
Year after year,
the weather's been good.

351
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,559
And not just that,

352
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:30,639
the River Spirit always punishes
anyone who does something bad.

353
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:32,320
Seriously?

354
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,879
Yes, I saw it with my own eyes.

355
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,270
One time, some truck drivers stopped
at Su Pa's gas station,

356
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:38,040
filled up, and drove off without paying.

357
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,000
Guess what?

358
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,960
They didn't even make it two miles

359
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,279
before their gas tanks were bone dry.

360
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,750
Tell me that's not divine punishment!

361
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,670
Siyuan, come here for a minute.

362
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,500
Doesn't that mean we're screwed too?

363
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,000
We just crashed into the River Spirit.

364
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:52,510
It's fine.

365
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,679
Siyuan, did you notice?

366
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,919
Jie En crashed into us on purpose.

367
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,630
I caught on
when we were making that turn.

368
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:00,480
I saw a car lurking under the bridge,

369
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,720
watching us.

370
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:03,840
It only started moving after we crossed.

371
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,279
Watch out!

372
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:07,880
Exactly.

373
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:09,839
I could feel someone watching us

374
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,119
from the shadows too.

375
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,079
Just be careful.

376
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,519
Come on.

377
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,640
Here. We're here.

378
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:30,920
Mr. Na Wa,

379
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,400
this house is really spacious.

380
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,240
Did you renovate your old place?

381
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:34,839
Yes.

382
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,279
Saved up for years

383
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,700
and finally got it done last year.

384
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,400
Looks alright?

385
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:38,920
Yes.

386
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:41,319
Make yourselves at home.

387
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:42,400
No need to be polite.

388
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:43,519
Come on in!

389
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,880
Grab a seat anywhere!

390
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:47,559
Here we go.

391
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:49,759
Here.

392
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,319
Later tonight,

393
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,359
I'll go catch a couple
of catfish for you.

394
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,599
Grilled catfish is the best.

395
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,400
Anything you need,

396
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,200
let me help you.

397
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,160
You came all this way,

398
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,440
so I won't let you do the work.

399
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,400
You're at my place now.

400
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,839
Just relax and let me handle it.

401
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,400
Okay, I'll do as you say.

402
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,350
I got some dragonfruit.
Give me a second.

403
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,340
Why does everyone keep saying

404
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,600
Su Pa is your wife?

405
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,000
Are you engaged or something?

406
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,680
The adults were just joking
when we were kids.

407
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,680
Something about Su Pa

408
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,880
feels a little off.

409
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,720
And there's a strange woman
in her house.

410
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,759
I tried talking to her,
but she ignored me.

411
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,240
She just sat by the window,

412
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,000
brushing her hair in front
of a mirror the whole time.

413
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:33,680
It was creepy.

414
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,000
A strange woman?

415
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,119
Was she really pretty?

416
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:37,680
Around 40 years old?

417
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,440
I've never seen a woman in her forties

418
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:40,279
look that gorgeous.

419
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,480
Her skin is flawless.

420
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,039
She doesn't even look forty.

421
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:46,200
That's Madam Ke Xin,

422
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,440
Su Pa's mother.

423
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:48,720
She moved to this village,

424
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,079
just like my mom and me.

425
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,640
Their lives haven't been

426
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,920
as easy as yours.

427
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,759
From what I've heard,

428
00:18:57,359 --> 00:18:59,029
when they first moved here,

429
00:18:59,030 --> 00:18:59,960
things were normal.

430
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:01,079
But then, one day,

431
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,039
something happened to Ke Xin.

432
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:05,240
Just like that, she lost her mind.

433
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,200
Ever since then, Su Pa has been running

434
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:09,079
that gas station all on her own.

435
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:13,000
Mr. Na Wa,

436
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,119
is Madam Ke Xin really insane?

437
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:19,519
Actually, I've never seen it myself.

438
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,980
I don't know their family that well,

439
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,160
and I don't really know

440
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:23,200
what happened to her.

441
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,680
But that's what people
in the village say.

442
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,200
I remember

443
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,519
hearing some rumors.

444
00:19:28,599 --> 00:19:30,480
They said that before she moved here,

445
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,200
Madam Ke Xin cheated on her husband,

446
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:34,880
and that her lover
beat her husband to death.

447
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:37,000
But in my memory,

448
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,759
Madam Ke Xin

449
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:39,200
was always quiet.

450
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,060
Then it's probably all just rumors.

451
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,140
It's not like spreading
lies costs people anything.

452
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,460
They just open their mouths

453
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,640
and make things up.

454
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,680
We're living in a modern era.

455
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,720
And they're still pinning
all the blame on women.

456
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,240
That's right.

457
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:53,480
Mr. Na Wa,

458
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:54,880
where is Tai Shu?

459
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,359
I want to make time
to see him while I'm back.

460
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:02,759
What's wrong?

461
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,510
He's been on the run
from debt collectors for years.

462
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,559
Do you know where he went?

463
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:21,839
You know what kind of person he is.

464
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,790
Drinking, gambling, chasing women...

465
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,680
There's nothing he hasn't done.

466
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,160
Back then, people kept showing up
at our house, demanding money.

467
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,119
He said he needed
to lay low for a while.

468
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,880
Before he left,

469
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,440
he even raided my mom's savings,

470
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,060
her retirement money, everything.

471
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:37,680
When did it happen?

472
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,519
About five or six years ago.

473
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,400
Yes.

474
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,120
It's been five years now.

475
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:44,400
He said

476
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,559
he had messed with someone
he really shouldn't have.

477
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,799
He took a long-haul bus and disappeared.

478
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:51,880
It's been five years.

479
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:54,240
Every New Year's Eve,

480
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,240
my mom still talks about him
at the dinner table.

481
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:04,839
Li Zhi,

482
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,759
I just remember

483
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:06,839
I left something in the car.

484
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,000
Come with me to grab it?

485
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,079
Sure, let's go.

486
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:10,039
Take your time.

487
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,079
Well.

488
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,740
Come back early for the grilled catfish!

489
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,160
Mr. Na Wa,

490
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,020
there's something I need to ask you.

491
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:23,759
About the fire at my house
ten years ago,

492
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,440
did Tai Shu ever mention
anything to you?

493
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,270
Have some water, Siyuan.

494
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,310
Thank you, Mr. Na Wa.

495
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,480
You're saying that Tai Shu was

496
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,759
near your house that night?

497
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:43,440
Yes.

498
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,319
It wasn't just him.

499
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,200
Song En and Nu Na were there too.

500
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:49,720
The photos show them clearly.

501
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,000
And they had nothing
like firefighting tools on them,

502
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,720
so they weren't
trying to put the fire out.

503
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,880
You're saying

504
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,000
it wasn't your brother
who started the fire,

505
00:21:58,359 --> 00:21:59,680
but Tai Shu and the others?

506
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,640
I don't know.

507
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:03,880
That's why I wanted to ask you.

508
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,620
Do you remember anything unusual

509
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,780
happening that night?

510
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,020
That night was
the Water Lantern Festival.

511
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,460
The whole village was out
floating lanterns on the river.

512
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:15,240
If you're asking about
something strange,

513
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,640
nothing really comes to mind.

514
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,580
But now that you mention it,

515
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,100
Liao Zhibai was acting pretty odd.

516
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:20,720
My brother?

517
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:23,160
Wasn't he in police
school over in Buhe?

518
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,700
He was supposed to be on break,

519
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,800
but he suddenly came back.

520
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,200
I hadn't seen him in a long time

521
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:28,720
and wanted to say hi,

522
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,400
but then...

523
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,720
What kind of god are you?

524
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,720
Who do you really protect?

525
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:46,880
Are you really doing your job?

526
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:57,960
I remember now.

527
00:22:58,759 --> 00:22:59,799
Around that time,

528
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:01,400
Tai Shu, Song En, and Nu Na

529
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,960
were meeting up a lot more than usual.

530
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:05,880
But as for what they talked about

531
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,960
or what they were up to

532
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,920
when they met,

533
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,160
I have no idea.

534
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:15,960
By the way,

535
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,960
earlier you said Tai Shu

536
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,880
left on a long-haul bus, right?

537
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:36,960
Found it.

538
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:39,200
On May 18, 2014,

539
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,720
Tai Shu

540
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,680
bought a ticket for a northbound bus.

541
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,519
It was for the 3:00 PM departure.

542
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,700
Just because he bought the ticket

543
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,380
doesn't mean he actually got on the bus.

544
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:52,340
It could've been a trick
to throw off his debt collectors.

545
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:53,480
Excuse me.

546
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,000
Do you still have surveillance footage
from back then?

547
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,349
Our security footage

548
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,920
gets overwritten every three months.

549
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,880
It's been five years.

550
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:01,279
There's no way to check now.

551
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:04,799
The fake eye.

552
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:11,119
Excuse me.

553
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,759
This guy's eye is fake.

554
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,160
It doesn't move.

555
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:17,400
Do you remember him?

556
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:20,279
Fake eye?

557
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:21,400
Yes.

558
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:24,119
Yes, I remember.

559
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,119
I saw him.

560
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:28,200
Hey! No cutting in line!

561
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,420
I need a ticket to the north.

562
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,480
Hey, I'm talking about you.

563
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,270
The earliest one.

564
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:32,960
Hurry up!

565
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:38,960
This is the afternoon one.

566
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,450
Didn't I ask for the earliest ticket?

567
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,840
The morning buses are full.

568
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:43,799
He immediately started arguing with me,

569
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:45,440
slamming his fists against the glass.

570
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:48,079
I called security right away,

571
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:49,620
but before they could even show up,

572
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,900
he got into a fight with someone
in line behind him.

573
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,720
Are you sure it was
the same guy you just recognized?

574
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,640
Absolutely.

575
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:57,359
Because...

576
00:24:57,559 --> 00:24:59,960
- Stop!
- Stop!

577
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,519
I was so freaked out back then.

578
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,540
I kept thinking
if anything happened later,

579
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,940
he might try to pin it on me.

580
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:10,900
But in the end,

581
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,160
my coworker saw him board

582
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,200
the bus that afternoon

583
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,519
with the ticket he bought.

584
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,119
His eye was perfectly fine.

585
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,440
That's when I realized

586
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,200
that it was a fake eye.

587
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,160
Here you go.

588
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,360
That'll be 1,000, please.

589
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,200
Thank you.

590
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:37,039
1,000.

591
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:45,759
What happened to your neck?

592
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:47,559
Neck?

593
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:50,960
Here.

594
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:53,279
Here.

595
00:26:08,225 --> 00:26:11,010
(Karma)

596
00:26:16,494 --> 00:26:21,080
(Karma)

597
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:42,359
The River Spirit.

598
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,759
The River Spirit.

599
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,000
The River Spirit.

600
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,000
Here.

601
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:15,279
Anyone has a corkscrew?

602
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,200
- Su Pa.
- Thanks.

603
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,359
How has Madam Ke Xin been lately?

604
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:29,440
She's doing fine.

605
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:32,240
My mom and I are happy.

606
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,120
Even though she's not well,

607
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,960
with the River Spirit's protection,

608
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:37,839
the villagers don't dare mess with us.

609
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,039
You're leaving tomorrow?

610
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,200
If I can't find Tai Shu,

611
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:45,039
there's no point in staying here.

612
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,420
Let me ask you something,

613
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:59,079
I heard you and Liao Siyuan
had a childhood engagement.

614
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,720
Is that true?

615
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,680
Yes.

616
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,759
Stop talking nonsense.

617
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:09,960
Back then, I said

618
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:11,319
I'd marry him if he could

619
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:12,160
grow taller than me.

620
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:13,559
Well, look at him now,

621
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,359
height-wise, he's barely acceptable.

622
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:17,269
But personality-wise?

623
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,600
He still looks kinda clueless.

624
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,960
Who are you calling clueless?

625
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:21,920
No.

626
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:23,680
I agree.

627
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,120
He's not good enough for you.

628
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,350
I think so too.

629
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:26,920
Li Zhi.

630
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:28,799
Thanks.

631
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,279
It was just a joke when we were little,

632
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:33,359
nothing serious.

633
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:34,640
Besides,

634
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,319
we're not part
of the same world anymore.

635
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,680
I'm going to go check on the drinks.

636
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,000
Xia, keep an eye on things.

637
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,440
Some things never change.

638
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,200
You're still the same
after all these years.

639
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,839
Are you actually mad?

640
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,599
I'm not mad.

641
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,279
It's just frustrating.

642
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,920
I finally found some leads,

643
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:20,599
and now they're dead.

644
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,400
I don't even know what to do next.

645
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,460
Take a good look around
while you're here.

646
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,359
It's not every day you get to come back.

647
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,799
Yong'an Village isn't

648
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:38,240
how I remember it.

649
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,640
Everything's different.

650
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,119
Even the smell of the river.

651
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,680
There's this weird stench.

652
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,680
Really?

653
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:55,000
Maybe it's just because
of all the rain lately.

654
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,110
Why do you think my brother
got into drugs?

655
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:05,519
Liao Zhibai would never do drugs.

656
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,920
He was proud,

657
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:14,440
brilliant,

658
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:15,799
and good-looking.

659
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,519
He had the perfect girlfriend

660
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,240
and a bright future ahead of him.

661
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,680
Even if

662
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:25,720
he somehow got addicted
while working a case,

663
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,860
do you really think he'd drag
his own family down with him?

664
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:35,279
You know why I believe
in the River Spirit?

665
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,400
Why?

666
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:39,720
Because I believe

667
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,440
that good is rewarded
and evil is punished.

668
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,279
Deep down,
was he a good person or a bad one?

669
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:49,880
You should know better than anyone.

670
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:52,880
Sometimes, what you hear doesn't matter,

671
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:56,839
what you believe does.

672
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:05,279
Thank you.

673
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,980
Water Lantern Festival
is in a couple of days.

674
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,560
You probably won't be here for it.

675
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:19,279
Set a lantern afloat for me.

676
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,079
Alright, I'll do it for you.

677
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:23,799
I wish you

678
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,119
peace, happiness,

679
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,960
and good health all year round.

680
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:04,000
Siyuan,

681
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,640
skipping straight home
after school again?

682
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:08,480
Do you want a scolding?

683
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,079
Boys will be boys.

684
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,440
Don't listen to your mother.

685
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,269
Just get inside

686
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:14,240
and wash up for dinner.

687
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,839
Come on, hurry up.

688
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,160
According to criminology statistics,

689
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:43,319
the two people most likely to return to

690
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:45,759
a crime scene
are investigators and the perpetrator.

691
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:50,079
Investigators come back
to search for clues

692
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,960
while the perpetrator
returns to erase them.

693
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,559
More often than not,

694
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,200
this is where their paths cross.

695
00:32:58,599 --> 00:32:59,519
Nice to meet you,

696
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:01,119
Liao Siyuan.

697
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,720
Don't I look cool?

698
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:10,160
You're so childish.

699
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:13,279
All that's left

700
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,279
are ashes and ruins.

701
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,510
There's probably nothing new to find.

702
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:19,160
Siyuan.

703
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,400
I'm not here for clues.

704
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:26,240
Nu Na is dead.

705
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,750
Song En has lost his mind.

706
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,039
And now, even the lead on Tai Shu

707
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:34,559
is gone.

708
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:37,640
But none of that matters anymore.

709
00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:39,960
Like you said,

710
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,119
I'll keep climbing toward the truth,

711
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:47,000
because it's up there.

712
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,200
If Tai Shu has disappeared,

713
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,240
I'll find the fourth person.

714
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,790
And even if the fourth person
vanishes too,

715
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,440
I know

716
00:33:57,799 --> 00:33:59,799
that somewhere in this world,

717
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:02,240
there's a piece of evidence

718
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,420
that can uncover
what really happened that night.

719
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:06,039
As long as it exists,

720
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,719
I will find it.

721
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,840
I believe in myself.

722
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,119
And as long as you're still with me,

723
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,519
everything I'm doing

724
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,880
has meaning.

725
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,039
Look,

726
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,840
these ruins

727
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,760
aren't just scorched earth
and broken walls.

728
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:42,199
Life is still growing from the ashes.

729
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,440
Siyuan...

730
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,079
Watch out!

731
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,239
The break is too clean.

732
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,360
This wasn't a natural fracture.

733
00:34:58,119 --> 00:34:58,760
Siyuan,

734
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,679
someone is watching us.

735
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,440
Ba Song,

736
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:24,679
you've seen

737
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:27,440
my stuff,

738
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,280
top quality.

739
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,280
Just tell me how much you want,

740
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:38,360
and let's lock this in today,

741
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:39,920
alright?

742
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:49,920
If you have any other conditions,
name them.

743
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:54,760
If I can make it happen, I will.

744
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:05,039
Let me ask you something.

745
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,440
Do you know that woman

746
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:09,440
at the gas station?

747
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,199
I seriously didn't expect

748
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,559
a place this small

749
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:18,360
to have someone that gorgeous.

750
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:25,639
Let me give you a heads-up...

751
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:28,920
Don't touch her.

752
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,920
The whole village says

753
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:37,119
she belongs to the River Spirit.

754
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:40,000
People have thought about her,

755
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:42,000
but anyone who dares to touch Ke Xin

756
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:43,760
always ends up paying for it.

757
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,400
It's bad luck.

758
00:36:55,559 --> 00:36:56,880
The River Spirit?

759
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:09,400
Okay, but let me ask you this.

760
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:12,719
Does your village's River Spirit

761
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:16,199
have any authority over
an outsider like me?

762
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,880
Good point.

763
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:27,320
Probably not.

764
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,840
Tonight,

765
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:40,719
I'm going to feel the joy
the River Spirit has experienced.

766
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,880
Let me walk you out.

767
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,079
River Spirit...

768
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:36,119
Baby,

769
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:39,320
I'm here.

770
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:44,320
