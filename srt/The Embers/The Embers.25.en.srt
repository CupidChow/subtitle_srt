1
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,000
Liao Zhibai has been detained
by the police.

2
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,920
He'll be sentenced in no time.

3
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,440
We're still looking for Mr. Gai De.

4
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,679
Please don't worry, Sir.

5
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:54,640
I think it's been hacked.

6
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:55,759
Don't move.

7
00:01:03,211 --> 00:01:06,880
(If you want to know where Gai De is,
get me out of the police station)

8
00:01:07,715 --> 00:01:12,700
(Twelve hours
before Liao Zhibai's death)

9
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:47,073
=The Embers=

10
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:51,140
=Episode 25=

11
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,520
What else happened
after you sent Liao Zhibai away?

12
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,240
That night,

13
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:01,000
I handed him over to Tie Xin

14
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,759
at the appointed time.

15
00:03:05,362 --> 00:03:09,930
(Seven hours
before Liao Zhibai's death)

16
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,080
Keep an eye on him.

17
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,080
Why are there two cars?

18
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,479
Split up.

19
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,190
Get out of the car!

20
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,639
Chief, it's a fake one!

21
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,390
Where is Liao Zhibai?

22
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,839
I don't know.

23
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,120
Oncoming car, pull over

24
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,480
or we'll shoot.

25
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:57,879
You got shot. Pull over.

26
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:00,920
No, I can't.

27
00:05:09,777 --> 00:05:13,240
(POLICE)

28
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:15,040
What is your plan with Liao Zhibai?

29
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,319
Where is he?

30
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,720
It's night

31
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:23,759
and it's raining.

32
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:27,120
Make me a bowl of noodles.

33
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,000
Let's talk serious business first.

34
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,240
I'll give it to you when we're done.

35
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:42,639
Serious business?

36
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,000
I really don't know.

37
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:53,759
In fact,

38
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:58,160
since the day Zhibai turned himself in
to the police,

39
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,439
I've had no contact with him.

40
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:06,759
One thing he told me

41
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:12,120
was that if Na Wei
got out of the station safely,

42
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,079
it would prove that his plan had failed.

43
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:17,879
He told me to send the video
of Gai De to Na Wei

44
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,759
to let Na Wei know
that Gai De was still alive.

45
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:23,519
Gai De is really alive?

46
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:24,240
Yes.

47
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:24,920
And then what?

48
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:25,720
And then?

49
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,680
There's no then.

50
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,480
Then...

51
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,540
The application that I asked Tai
to install for you

52
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,590
has already been installed.

53
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:51,950
As soon as you switch on the phone,

54
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,760
the message will be sent automatically.

55
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,160
What do you want to send?

56
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,160
You're being so mysterious.

57
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,199
Nothing.

58
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,759
Oh right, you'd better arrange

59
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:12,000
for the rest.

60
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,639
When it's done,

61
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:14,839
leave as soon as possible.

62
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
If that pen doesn't convict Na Wei,

63
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:19,319
we'll proceed with Plan B.

64
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,040
Send Gai De's video to Na Wei

65
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,959
and guarantee me a meeting with Na Wei.

66
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:28,639
Then, please go to this place

67
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,199
and find someone for me.

68
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:41,639
Switzerland?

69
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,319
That's far.

70
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:44,480
Who's it?

71
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:45,920
A very important witness.

72
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,639
I didn't want to disturb him.

73
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:52,759
But if it comes to this,

74
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:54,639
we'll have no choice.

75
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:59,319
Don't worry, leave it to me.

76
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,550
I'll bring him back to you even if it
means going to the ends of the earth.

77
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,720
It's been a tough journey, buddy.

78
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:14,439
Thank you.

79
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:29,720
I can't see the moon today.

80
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:33,759
What a pity.

81
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,159
Zhibai gave me an address

82
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,960
to find an important person.

83
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,000
After the video was sent to Na Wei,

84
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,200
we were ready to go to the address

85
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:52,799
to find the witness.

86
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,559
Switzerland. Key witness.

87
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:04,559
When did Zhibai meet him?

88
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,879
I have no idea.

89
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,480
Zhibai told us to look for him,
so just look for him.

90
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,960
Are our passports ready?

91
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,000
Don't worry, everything's ready.

92
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,460
We'll have no trouble
getting through customs.

93
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,720
What's the matter?

94
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,500
Something's wrong.

95
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,630
Look up the address

96
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:31,200
and see what it is.

97
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:32,000
Okay.

98
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,399
The address is a resort.

99
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,559
There's a phone number.

100
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:42,440
I'll call and find out.

101
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,520
Which one of you know English?

102
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:52,799
Give it to me.

103
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,440
Can you speak Chinese?

104
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,200
She can't.

105
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:02,399
Take it.

106
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:10,519
Yes. This room has been reserved

107
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:11,559
since last week

108
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:13,679
but nobody still occupies it yet.

109
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:15,399
The gentleman who made

110
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:18,639
the reservation left his check-in
information. I can check it now.

111
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:20,519
One of them is Bai.

112
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:22,799
It's you, right?

113
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:25,879
Okay, let me show you now.

114
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:47,360
The person he's asking us to find

115
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,360
is the person we once were.

116
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,000
Don't you think he's ridiculous?

117
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,120
But luckily,

118
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:10,639
I found out early.

119
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,039
I guessed

120
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:15,039
if Na Wei knew Gai De was still alive,

121
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:18,000
he'd try to get Zhibai out of jail.

122
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:21,720
I'm sure Zhibai had guessed that too.

123
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:24,919
I didn't know how he was going to do it,

124
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:28,120
but the only thing I knew was

125
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:34,480
that I was going to help him.

126
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,670
Even if it costs you your life?

127
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,559
Even if it costs me my life.

128
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:51,120
So where is Gai De now?

129
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,600
You think

130
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:05,480
I'd tell you that?

131
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:09,679
Tomorrow.

132
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,639
Maybe I'll tell you tomorrow,

133
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,840
or else I'll mess up Zhibai's rhythm.

134
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,240
Where are Gan and Tai?

135
00:12:26,303 --> 00:12:27,120
Tomorrow.

136
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,879
Let's talk tomorrow.

137
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:36,039
Give me the noodles sooner.

138
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,639
And my glasses.

139
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:48,957
(One hour before Liao Zhibai's death)

140
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,080
Let's recall now.

141
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,480
(Nine hours after Liao Zhibai's death)

142
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,870
(Nine hours after Liao Zhibai's death)
After what happened with Gai De,

143
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,279
(Nine hours after Liao Zhibai's death)
what did Na Wei do?

144
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,420
(Nine hours after Liao Zhibai's death)

145
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,740
The fact that he came
to the police station to put pressure

146
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,120
meant that he didn't want
to kill my brother.

147
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,960
At least not at that time.

148
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,559
But why did he suddenly
go back on his word

149
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,720
and let Ni Ke take him away?

150
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,159
At the very beginning,

151
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,159
Liao Zhibai had a gunfight
in front of Na Wei's house.

152
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:31,720
Na Wei was in the right.

153
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,080
That's why it's the fastest way
to deal with it

154
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,679
through the police force.

155
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:41,840
But after leaving the station,

156
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,320
he might have got some new information.

157
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:48,840
This information can't be shared
with the police.

158
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,320
He can only act on his own.

159
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,720
Can't be shared with the police?

160
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,679
Gai De is still alive.

161
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:09,559
What do you mean?

162
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,720
If Gai De's still alive,

163
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,960
it'll be a death sentence

164
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,120
if the police catch him.

165
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,840
If Na Wei wanted to save his son,

166
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,460
he'd have to get my brother
out of the police station

167
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:25,159
without a trace

168
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,039
and ask my brother where Gai De was.

169
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,120
Go on.

170
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:33,240
And this pen.

171
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,600
This pen

172
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,600
was my brother's evidence against Na Wei.

173
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:41,960
But the biological information on this

174
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:43,679
doesn't match Na Wei.

175
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:49,000
In theory, this pen had nothing
to do with Na Wei,

176
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:52,480
but he had it taken away
specifically for him.

177
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,480
It means it has
a special significance to him.

178
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:01,960
Xia,

179
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,380
you have all the biological information
on this pen

180
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:05,559
on record, don't you?

181
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:06,480
Of course.

182
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:08,639
If another one appears
exactly the same,

183
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:09,840
I'll recognize it instantly.

184
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:13,799
There's one more thing
I can't figure out.

185
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,080
Ni Ke said he handed Liao Zhibai over
to Tie Xin.

186
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:19,960
Tie Xin's been wanted for a long time.

187
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,720
Why would he come back to Na Wei's side

188
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:27,799
at such a critical moment?

189
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,080
It's too much of a risk.

190
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,870
Under these circumstances,

191
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,879
Na Wei still relies on Tie Xin,

192
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:37,399
which means
that Na Wei has no one else to rely on

193
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:38,639
except Tie Xin.

194
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,240
Besides,

195
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:42,720
could Tie Xin

196
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:44,519
have his own agenda?

197
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,440
Hello.

198
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,840
Tie Xin's been found.

199
00:15:57,771 --> 00:16:00,630
(Ten hours after Liao Zhibai's death)

200
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,559
Bai Han confessed

201
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:10,080
that this is where Gai De hid.

202
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:14,960
Chief, a car recorder.

203
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,279
I found it on Tie Xin's body.

204
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,120
Car recorder.

205
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:48,360
I can't go back tonight anyway.

206
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,279
Can you take this hood off for me?

207
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:52,879
I can't breathe.

208
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,279
Take it off.

209
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:03,440
Thank you.

210
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,440
Do you know why Na Wei tried

211
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:11,200
to get me out even if he had

212
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,200
to send someone
to break into a police station?

213
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:17,960
You don't want to talk, do you?

214
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,640
Let's talk about you.

215
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:22,759
Ten years ago,

216
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,319
you did a professional job

217
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,320
on Gai De's murder of Lang Sang,
didn't you?

218
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:29,319
Even I was fooled by you.

219
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:32,119
But it's a shame

220
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,119
that after all the work
you've done for Gai De,

221
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,240
he slept with your wife.

222
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,359
I just used a little trickery,

223
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,160
and he confessed to everything.

224
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:50,640
Of course.

225
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,480
Yours was a bonus.

226
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:56,680
It's been hard on you all these years,
hasn't it?

227
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,480
The father and the son

228
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,160
have gone too far.

229
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,240
You've done so much for them.

230
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:07,880
They are really ingrates.

231
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:09,440
If you have the strength,

232
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,960
think about what you're going
to say later.

233
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,839
If Mr. Na Wei

234
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:16,319
doesn't get a satisfactory answer,

235
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,440
he won't let you go.

236
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,400
That's easy, bro.

237
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,720
He wants to save Gai De, right?

238
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,759
But I don't intend

239
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:34,000
to hand Gai De over to him.

240
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,440
I want to hand Gai De over to you.

241
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:45,799
How can I trust you?

242
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:46,799
Think about it.

243
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:49,200
After today,

244
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,960
will Na Wei really leave you alone?

245
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,279
I think

246
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,340
it's best if just the two of us

247
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,599
know about the following lines.

248
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,000
Let's discuss

249
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:07,119
how Gai De

250
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:10,400
ended up the way he is now.

251
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:14,160
It's because your identity

252
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,799
was revealed on the day
of Liu Haixun's death.

253
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:18,720
Na Wei burned down our house

254
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:20,680
to protect his son.

255
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,119
And who do you think

256
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,359
the fire will burn

257
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:28,559
this time?

258
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:36,880
I can help you.

259
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:40,480
It's true.

260
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:47,640
Let's go back to Yong'an Village now.

261
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:51,319
Then you call him and tell him

262
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:53,400
to wait for me by the river

263
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,240
if he still wants to see his son.

264
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,480
If you do it my way,

265
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,319
I'll hand over Gai De to you.

266
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,680
Deal.

267
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:20,240
That means

268
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,400
my brother met Na Wei
at the appointed place

269
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,920
that night

270
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:26,839
and used Gai De as a bargaining chip

271
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,240
to negotiate with him.

272
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:32,799
But Liao Zhibai is dead

273
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,119
and Na Wei is still alive.

274
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:35,880
What did they talk about?

275
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,279
In there, my brother said

276
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,759
he wouldn't tell Na Wei

277
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,480
about Gai De's whereabouts,

278
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:45,559
but he would tell Tie Xin.

279
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:49,200
That means Na Wei didn't get any clues

280
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:51,079
and killed my brother in anger.

281
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,880
After that, Tie Xin went
to look for Gai De

282
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,359
and was followed by Na Wei.

283
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,920
Na Wei rescued Gai De and killed Tie Xin.

284
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:05,960
My brother purposely
let Na Wei kill himself

285
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,680
so that Na Wei would be convinced
of the murder.

286
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,759
That way,

287
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:14,880
his body would be the proof
of Na Wei's murder.

288
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,350
Sacrificing himself
in order to convict someone

289
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:21,440
is really what he would do.

290
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:23,119
It's neither legal

291
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,279
nor permitted.

292
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,759
What a fool.

293
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,119
Does he think he's very cool?

294
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:36,640
He had no choice.

295
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,200
The pen that was prepared earlier

296
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,560
didn't work to bring down Na Wei.

297
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,990
And he already turned himself in.

298
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,000
He knew in his heart

299
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,700
that he could either spend the rest
of his life in the police station

300
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,750
or get out.

301
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,640
But he also knew

302
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,750
that even if he escaped,

303
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,839
he'd be caught by the police in no time.

304
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,240
So this was his only option

305
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,550
within the limited time available to him.

306
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:06,319
I re-compared Liao Zhibai's fatal wound.

307
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,519
From the shape of the fatal wound
on his neck,

308
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:09,240
we can confirm

309
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:10,319
that it was caused

310
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:12,319
by the pen that Ni Ke stole.

311
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,000
Combined with your reasoning,

312
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,599
we can confirm

313
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:16,599
that the pen on Na Wei

314
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:18,359
is the key evidence
that killed Liao Zhibai.

315
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:21,480
Then we can arrest him now.

316
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:23,319
Na Wei has a Knight's Cross.

317
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,319
We couldn't even
get a search warrant before.

318
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:28,680
We couldn't get into his villa.

319
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:31,720
Someone just came to mind.

320
00:22:33,594 --> 00:22:38,700
(Eleven hours after Liao Zhibai's death)

321
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:54,839
Sorry to keep you waiting.

322
00:22:57,319 --> 00:22:59,240
Why are you wearing so much
in this heat?

323
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,640
Here's some coconut water

324
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,759
to cool you down.

325
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:13,960
I watched Macbeth the other day.

326
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,079
I just watched it too.

327
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,440
The theater is still the same,

328
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:24,079
the play is still the same,

329
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,720
but the feeling is not the same.

330
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:29,640
It's not bad.

331
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:31,880
I think the play

332
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,240
is getting very interesting.

333
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,780
Watching it often
gives you new insights.

334
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,180
You didn't fall asleep again, did you?

335
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:49,200
I fell asleep because
I couldn't understand in the past.

336
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:53,160
Now I fall asleep

337
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,839
because I understand.

338
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,480
Mostly because
there are no great actors now.

339
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:06,400
Say it.

340
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,839
Why did you ask me

341
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,080
to come here to watch a play?

342
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,240
I want to ask you a favor.

343
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,160
You're a big shot, and I'm a small fry.

344
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,830
How could I possibly
do any favors for you?

345
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:31,960
My son is missing.

346
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,240
Your son is missing.

347
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:37,440
I'd like you to help me find him.

348
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:40,160
I help you find him?

349
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,279
Your son is missing,

350
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:46,269
and you should call the police.

351
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:48,460
Recently, the police station
has been in an uproar

352
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,480
over Liao Zhibai's case.

353
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,319
I'm worried they won't do their best.

354
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:55,759
By the way,

355
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,440
I've heard

356
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,000
that you have a son in Early
Childhood Education at Buhe University.

357
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,400
Security's been

358
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,319
a little bad in Buhe lately.

359
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,160
You've got to protect him.

360
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,880
Okay.

361
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:33,480
I'll wait for your good news then.

362
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,119
This can really cool me down.

363
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,279
Jian, let me do it.

364
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,079
I thought

365
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,920
I'd never get through this door again.

366
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,000
What's keeping you up so late?

367
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,640
Are you hurt?

368
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,440
You must be blaming me

369
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,839
for not opening the door that day.

370
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:08,640
How can I blame you?

371
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:11,119
You gave me my life.

372
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,240
You can do whatever you want with me.

373
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:25,720
Play with me.

374
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,079
I haven't played in years.

375
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,000
You used to play with me

376
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,220
every time I came here when I was a kid.

377
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,559
Okay.

378
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:08,720
I'll play with you for a while.

379
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,790
In fact, I've already
made plans for that day.

380
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:47,319
He won't really do anything to you.

381
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,079
He's trying to push me.

382
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,000
It's heartbreaking

383
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,119
for parents to see their children suffer.

384
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,079
But I had to endure it.

385
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:04,160
Because if I really opened the door,

386
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:09,039
we'd all be finished.

387
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:19,080
I'll send you away first thing
in the morning.

388
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:20,599
Don't worry.

389
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,590
I won't let anything happen
to you again.

390
00:31:28,717 --> 00:31:29,530
(GAME OVER)

391
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:39,000
One more round.

392
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,480
Okay.

393
00:32:13,188 --> 00:32:13,900
(GAME OVER)

394
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:17,799
I'm old.

395
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:20,559
I can't beat you.

396
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,519
But you used to beat me all the time.

397
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,880
You can't compare the past
with the present.

398
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,519
How old were you and how old was I?

399
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,119
All right.

400
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:45,680
If you want to play some more,
you can go ahead yourself.

401
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,240
I'm going to bed.

402
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,920
Don't stay up too late.

403
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,640
You have your difficulties.

404
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:18,039
I understand.

405
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:23,720
I don't blame you.

406
00:33:48,279 --> 00:33:48,880
Good night.

407
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,920
I think he should have slept enough.

408
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:37,840
The boat's leaving soon.

409
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,320
Go wake him up.

410
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,400
Sir,

411
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,440
there are many cops outside.

412
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,119
I'll try to slow them down.

413
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:00,960
You take Gai De out the back door.

414
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:36,920
Mr. Na Wei,

415
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,519
we've received a report

416
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,590
that you're involved in a murder case.

417
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,920
We have you under arrest,
as required by law.

418
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:45,840
Come with us.

419
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,519
Murder?

420
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:54,639
Do you have any evidence?

421
00:36:01,239 --> 00:36:01,920
Shut it.

422
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,679
Again?

423
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,679
All right.

424
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,480
I'll cooperate with you.

425
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:20,760
It's just a DNA test.

426
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,400
Let's go.

427
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:27,400
I don't think you get it.

428
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,760
This pen

429
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:30,920
is the one you had Ni Ke steal

430
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:33,639
and the weapon that killed Liao Zhibai.

431
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:47,840
Gai De.

432
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,960
Gai De is now a state's witness
for the police.

433
00:36:53,159 --> 00:36:54,039
Please step back.

434
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:55,800
Gai De...

435
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,519
I finally know why you've been

436
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:00,159
doing this to me all these years.

437
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,159
It's not because
I'm an illegitimate child,

438
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:08,639
is it?

439
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:34,020
It's been revealed that a prominent
entrepreneur, Mr. Na Wei,

440
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,380
has been arrested by the police.

441
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,680
The crime involved is serious,

442
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:39,320
and the methods used to commit
the offense are extremely vicious.

443
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:44,030
(Qi's Pharmacy)
He's now in custody awaiting trial.

444
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:45,639
Eat slowly. It's hot.

445
00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:47,280
Ms. Meihua,

446
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,239
where did you find Gai De?

447
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,280
I don't know

448
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:53,679
exactly where.

449
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:56,239
I asked Jin

450
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,639
to get our Chinatown boys

451
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,119
to split up and look for him.

452
00:38:00,519 --> 00:38:02,960
I didn't expect them to be so efficient.

453
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:04,639
I'm wondering

454
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,760
if your brother's spirit

455
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:08,280
is watching over us

456
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,040
and doesn't want anything
to happen to you.

457
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:11,119
Mom,

458
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,840
how did you persuade Gai De

459
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,159
to help you steal the evidence?

460
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:15,119
Yes.

461
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,039
Gai De's just a madman,

462
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,320
but he's not stupid.

463
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,159
How could he help the police?

464
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,800
Of course it's all about hate.

465
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:27,920
When he got stabbed several times,

466
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:29,920
his dad wouldn't open the door for him.

467
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,039
Gai De has seen Na Wei for what he is.

468
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:33,840
At the end of the day,
this father and son

469
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,440
are just people who love themselves.

470
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,940
And it just so happened
that the police gave Gai De the chance

471
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,039
to trade his dad's life for his own.

472
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:41,599
It's a good deal.

473
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,030
I've got a nice bottle of wine
in my room.

474
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:50,360
It's perfect for today.

475
00:38:50,679 --> 00:38:52,000
Xia, bring it here.

476
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,320
I'll go and get it.

477
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:54,679
Wait.

478
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,000
What are you going to do?

479
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:57,159
How old are you?

480
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,920
Can you just go into a girl's room?

481
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:01,880
Go now.

482
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:04,639
Since when are you so particular?

483
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:05,881
Girl, huh?

484
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,960
I've always been very particular.

485
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,039
Siyuan,

486
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,480
there's something

487
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,880
I never told you.

488
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,840
Before Shen Congxin jumped out
of the building,

489
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:26,639
your brother came to see me once.

490
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,280
Lady boss,

491
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:35,880
are you busy?

492
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,119
Hi, Ms. Meihua.

493
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:38,360
It's so early.

494
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,239
The early bird catches the worm.

495
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,039
Ms. Meihua,

496
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,710
it's been a long time.

497
00:40:08,519 --> 00:40:09,440
What did he say?

498
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:13,679
He asked me to take care of you

499
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:16,400
and gave me the address
of Gai De's house.

500
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:18,960
He said he was afraid you'd be in danger

501
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,800
and that I should protect you.

502
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,800
Anything else?

503
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,239
A bank card.

504
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:36,079
He said it was for Xia...

505
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,800
I want to ask you a favor.

506
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,079
I've raised Siyuan since he was little.

507
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:47,079
He's like my own son.

508
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,780
You've got it all wrong.

509
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:53,159
This has nothing to do with Siyuan.

510
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,480
This is for Xia.

511
00:40:59,719 --> 00:41:00,679
You know

512
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,440
she's afraid of the dark.

513
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,320
From the police station to the pharmacy,

514
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,639
there's a road without streetlights.

515
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,320
She had just graduated

516
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,320
and was new to the police force.

517
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:19,800
She hadn't learned to drive yet.

518
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,060
And she had to work overtime every day.

519
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:28,480
She had to walk by herself every night,

520
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:37,199
so I secretly installed
a streetlight for her.

521
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,440
So she wouldn't be afraid.

522
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,639
The one problem with this streetlight

523
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:58,559
is that you have
to pay a big fine to the city

524
00:41:58,679 --> 00:41:59,960
every year.

525
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:04,239
And a maintenance fee every spring.

526
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,880
I'm afraid I won't be able
to wait for the next spring.

527
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,920
So I'll ask you to handle it from now on.

528
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:29,199
Okay.

529
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,519
Take care.

530
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,079
And I'm not going to tell Xia.

531
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,199
He's dead.

532
00:42:50,199 --> 00:42:51,599
Why should I tell her that?

533
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,360
She'd better forget about it sooner.

534
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,679
Ms. Qi Meihua,

535
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,320
you're really enjoying this alone.

536
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,980
You've been hiding such good wine
behind our backs.

537
00:43:24,679 --> 00:43:26,320
No, I haven't.

538
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,740
I've saved it for you to drink.

539
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,800
All mine are yours.

540
00:43:30,039 --> 00:43:30,679
Open it.

541
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:34,559
All your business is over now,

542
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:35,159
right?

543
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,079
I suggest

544
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,440
we go on a family holiday.

545
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:40,559
Okay?

546
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:43,519
I can't make it.

547
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,239
Na Wei's case isn't over yet.

548
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:46,920
And we haven't found out

549
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,800
who put Zhibai's body

550
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:49,840
in the gift box.

551
00:43:50,519 --> 00:43:52,119
If it wasn't

552
00:43:52,119 --> 00:43:53,920
for the overwhelming media attention,

553
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,039
the case wouldn't have gone so smoothly.

554
00:43:59,070 --> 00:43:59,960
What a spoilsport.

555
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,920
Siyuan, let's go.

556
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:04,440
Why don't we wait for Xia?

557
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,920
If it's just the two of us,

558
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,950
there's one less person
to play the card game with.

559
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:10,000
All right.

560
00:44:10,519 --> 00:44:12,079
When your cases are over,

561
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,000
you have to play with me for once.

562
00:44:14,679 --> 00:44:15,840
Raise your hand if you agree.

563
00:44:16,199 --> 00:44:16,760
Okay.

564
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:17,760
Hands up.

565
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,079
Come on.

566
00:44:21,639 --> 00:44:21,960
Cheers!

567
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,119
I want you all to be healthy

568
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:25,719
and safe.

569
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,440
My body will definitely be
under the water here.

570
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:27,510
Please make good use of it.

571
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:29,360
Siyuan,

572
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,880
this is our final plan.
