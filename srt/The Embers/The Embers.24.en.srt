1
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,800
(Year 2008)

2
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:26,920
I'm done here.

3
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:27,980
How's it going on your end?

4
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:28,700
Wait a minute.

5
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:29,680
There's a bad connection.

6
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:30,710
Why still waiting?

7
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,669
I've set up over 20 bulbs!

8
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:33,640
Why aren't you done yet?

9
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,520
Okay. It's almost done.

10
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,780
Why are you taking so much time?

11
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:36,820
Let me do it. Stop arguing.

12
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:38,280
Quiet! I'm memorizing the script!

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:38,920
Seriously.

14
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:40,640
Glow of the sea

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,159
and what? And...

16
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:43,719
Wait. Glow of the sea...

17
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:44,600
And then what?

18
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,280
Don't you two already
know each other's feelings?

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,160
Why are you making
such a big deal out of it?

20
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:52,359
Because I want to give her
a formal confession.

21
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:53,840
Remember,

22
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:55,880
girls are very particular about this.

23
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,399
Don't be perfunctory, okay?

24
00:00:57,399 --> 00:00:58,039
Got it.

25
00:00:58,679 --> 00:00:59,719
Wait. Glow of the sea...

26
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:00,600
And then what?

27
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,000
She's here. Let's get out of here.

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,039
A sky full of stars...

29
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,000
Move the stuff.

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,640
This one.

31
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,360
Move the ladder!

32
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:05,780
Ladder!

33
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:06,710
And that one over there.

34
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,740
The box, and the ladder!
Put the ladder away.

35
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,590
Help him out.

36
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,709
Slippers. My slippers!

37
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:13,740
Watch out for the lights!

38
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:15,640
My slippers!

39
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,040
Why did you ask me to come here?

40
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,080
I... I have something to tell you.

41
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:40,040
What's it?

42
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:45,959
The mermaids in the night time

43
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,480
will make the glow of the sea and...

44
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:51,840
And...

45
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,000
Shut up. You're too loud.

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,239
Did you tie the balloons?

47
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,239
Shut up.

48
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:56,599
A sky full of stars...

49
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,359
Forget it.

50
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:01,319
It's a failure. We... Let's go.

51
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:01,959
Let's go.

52
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,159
There are balloons, flowers

53
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,080
and colored lights.

54
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,759
You're not trying
to confess your love to me, are you?

55
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:22,680
N... No.

56
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:24,439
You're not trying to confess to me?

57
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,260
No, I didn't mean that.

58
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,160
Actually, I've been waiting a long time.

59
00:02:58,599 --> 00:02:59,520
This time,

60
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,120
I'll take the initiative.

61
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:05,800
Liao Zhibai,

62
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,919
will you

63
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,000
be my boyfriend?

64
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,960
- Be together!
- Be together!

65
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,961
- Be together!
- Be together!

66
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,439
- Be together!
- Be together!

67
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:59,410
=The Embers=

68
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:03,350
=Episode 24=

69
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:25,600
I brought you some food.

70
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:34,120
What's wrong?

71
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,199
I thought they said
he was getting better.

72
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:37,639
Why isn't he waking up?

73
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,040
Li Zhi, be honest,

74
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:41,839
looking at Yuan like this,

75
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,040
with pale lips

76
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,040
and bloodless skin,

77
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,120
do you feel like

78
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,480
you can't resist him?

79
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,480
Are you sick?

80
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,120
I read online

81
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,940
that this kind of persona
is popular nowadays,

82
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,830
called a sickly man.

83
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,680
You're sick, aren't you?

84
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:06,480
You're awake.

85
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:13,639
Now that you're awake,

86
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,480
let's give a statement.

87
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:17,680
You're sick too, aren't you?

88
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,120
Think carefully. Is there anything else?

89
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:30,759
No.

90
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:33,519
Okay. Nothing wrong with your brain.

91
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,680
Sign here.

92
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,190
There are two documents.

93
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,279
One on Gai De's sexual assault,

94
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,959
and one on

95
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,720
the physical abuse he inflicted on you.

96
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:47,759
By the way,

97
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,560
how is he now?

98
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,680
You got him?

99
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,000
I can't disclose it yet.

100
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,240
Ask Shu He when you get back.

101
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,879
If there's nothing else,

102
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:11,639
we'll go back to the station.

103
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:14,959
Let's go.

104
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,800
I bought your share.

105
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,920
Have some before you go.

106
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,639
That's cool.

107
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,120
Let's dig in.

108
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:25,920
Come on.

109
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:29,839
What's going on?

110
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,480
Qi Xia told me

111
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,879
to call her as soon as you woke up.

112
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,920
But I can't get through.

113
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,040
I guess she's busy.

114
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,519
There was a case this morning.

115
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,079
What case?

116
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:41,069
How do I know?

117
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,860
I was here watching over you, wasn't I?

118
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,879
Early this morning,

119
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,279
a man's body was found at
the intersection of Yumanfeng Expressway

120
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:53,120
and Qianning Expressway.

121
00:07:53,600 --> 00:08:01,639
The body was identified as the suspect
in the Liao family's fire

122
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:08,680
in Yong'an Village ten years ago,
who came back from the dead,

123
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,240
Liao Zhibai.

124
00:08:19,253 --> 00:08:23,820
(One hour after Liao Zhibai's death)

125
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,080
Xia.

126
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,559
I know you're worried about me.

127
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:46,960
I'm fine.

128
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,120
Get the body out there.

129
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,399
Prepare for autopsy.

130
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,240
Let me do it.

131
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,039
Same as the preliminary,

132
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,700
there are water stains on the clothes,

133
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:40,159
residual soil and watercress.

134
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:43,840
Soak them for samples.

135
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,480
Okay.

136
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:01,440
Stab wounds,

137
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,080
gunshot wounds,

138
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,600
and strangulation marks...

139
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:11,480
What have you been through
in the last ten years?

140
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,080
Xia,

141
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:15,520
why don't we report this
to our superiors

142
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,440
and get another forensic pathologist
to do this?

143
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,039
No need.

144
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,200
I thought

145
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,840
he'd tell me

146
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,320
everything that's happened
over the years,

147
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:40,279
one by one, one day.

148
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,360
I just didn't expect it

149
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,639
to be this way.

150
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:13,559
Liao Zhibai...

151
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:20,200
I'll listen to every word...

152
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,960
you leave behind carefully.

153
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:04,840
The autopsy's over.

154
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:09,519
Call his family

155
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:14,600
to come and claim him.

156
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:16,159
Okay.

157
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,159
Zhibai,

158
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,000
you've kept me waiting again.

159
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,720
I really don't understand

160
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,320
why you chose this path.

161
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:26,960
But it's okay.

162
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,440
It's all coming to an end.

163
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:35,840
Let's go home.

164
00:14:37,274 --> 00:14:45,560
(Three hours after Liao Zhibai's death)

165
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:51,480
Xia.

166
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:02,919
Why don't you sign it?

167
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:23,310
(Liao Zhibai's Death Certificate)

168
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:26,200
Can...

169
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,000
I sign it?

170
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:43,720
You're his family too.

171
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:46,840
Why not?

172
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,919
How did you convince them
to let me sign?

173
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,799
It's clearly against the rules.

174
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,960
I didn't say anything.

175
00:16:58,759 --> 00:16:59,600
I told them

176
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:02,440
to let you sign it once,

177
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,240
and I'll sign it again later.

178
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:09,279
I knew it.

179
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,559
Anyway, thank you.

180
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:18,000
Siyuan,

181
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,279
my name

182
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,920
is finally

183
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:28,319
on a piece of paper

184
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,279
with a red seal, together with his.

185
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,440
It's not quite what I thought before

186
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:38,920
but

187
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,319
we're at least related,

188
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,640
right?

189
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,680
I think I've said goodbye to him

190
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,759
many times.

191
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,680
During the autopsy,

192
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,880
I wondered

193
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:08,400
if he would

194
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:11,799
suddenly jump out of nowhere

195
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:16,519
and tell me with a smile on his face,

196
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:18,960
"Look,

197
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,039
I fooled you again."

198
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,559
I think so too.

199
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:34,079
He's a

200
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,119
selfish,

201
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,200
bigoted man.

202
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,759
He's using human life

203
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,519
as a bargaining chip.

204
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,599
I can't believe

205
00:18:55,867 --> 00:18:57,079
a man like that

206
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,400
just died.

207
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,400
He won't die for nothing.

208
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:10,640
As Shu He said,

209
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,880
he must have his own intentions.

210
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:19,599
He wanted his body

211
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:22,759
as the final piece of evidence.

212
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,240
Not only did he not take
other people's lives seriously,

213
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,640
but also his own.

214
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,240
I'm glad I didn't marry him.

215
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:49,319
He was just

216
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:53,880
so cruel.

217
00:20:02,945 --> 00:20:08,210
(POLICE)

218
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,540
(Five hours after Liao Zhibai's death)
He turned himself voluntarily?

219
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,400
(Five hours after Liao Zhibai's death)

220
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,000
Yes.

221
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,519
Not only did he turn himself in,
he reported a crime,

222
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,200
and he gave evidence

223
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,880
that Na Wei was the real culprit
in the fire ten years ago.

224
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:25,279
And then what?

225
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:36,079
See for yourself.

226
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:51,200
He couldn't be wrong.

227
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:53,599
If he's turning himself in,

228
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,400
he must be certain of what he's doing.

229
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,119
Something must have gone wrong.

230
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,119
Where's Na Wei now?

231
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:06,359
There's no evidence.

232
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:07,759
He's released.

233
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:09,799
He's released?

234
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,279
Hello.

235
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:22,319
The autopsy report is out.

236
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,319
The murder took place

237
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:29,960
between 12 to 2 AM last night.

238
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,640
According to the physical evidence,

239
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,400
the first dump site

240
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,880
should be the river
next to Yong'an Village.

241
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:39,640
The body sank in the water.

242
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,279
It's a logical way
for a person to commit a crime.

243
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,640
However, the body

244
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,319
appeared at an intersection
with many people.

245
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,319
It's obvious
that it's not the murderer's work.

246
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,070
How did my brother
leave the police station?

247
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,599
At 9 PM last night,

248
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,119
we were working late at the office

249
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,160
when the power
in the station suddenly went out.

250
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,640
Liao Zhibai was taken away

251
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,400
at that time.

252
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,590
It's a serious incident
when a suspect

253
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:18,140
was taken away from a police station.

254
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,260
We immediately accessed
all the CCTV footage

255
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:23,000
and targeted this man.

256
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,359
He first tasered an office,

257
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:27,400
took the key,

258
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,640
and took Liao Zhibai away.

259
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,160
Does this man look familiar to you?

260
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,279
I don't know,

261
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:46,720
but he knows the inside
of the police station very well,

262
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,790
and cleverly avoided
many surveillance cameras,

263
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,920
leaving only this back figure.

264
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:55,720
There's a mole.

265
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,270
Director has ordered us
to investigate ourselves.

266
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:01,640
Everyone is a suspect.

267
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,400
Do you have a copy
of last night's shift log?

268
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,480
We've been working overtime

269
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:12,080
because of the Liao Zhibai's case,

270
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,340
and no one has taken leave.

271
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,720
There were backup lights
in the office last night

272
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,079
when the power went out.

273
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:18,599
I didn't see anyone leave.

274
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,000
Ni Ke wasn't here.

275
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,500
He's working out of the station.

276
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,160
Ni Ke?

277
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:30,119
I called him twice in between.

278
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:31,079
He's clear.

279
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:35,519
Two calls? What time?

280
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:43,039
One at 9:08 PM,

281
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:44,319
and the other at 9:25 PM.

282
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,559
9:08 PM...

283
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,000
9:25 PM...

284
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,549
Ni Ke, you're finally back.

285
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,600
What took you so long?

286
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:42,270
I'm starving.

287
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:44,240
They ran out of pineapple rice,

288
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,550
so they cooked it fresh.

289
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:46,400
I waited for a while.

290
00:24:51,416 --> 00:24:53,900
(22:32 PM)

291
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,920
No, Ni Ke's lying.

292
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,880
He just got back at 10:30 PM,

293
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,400
so he must not have been
at the hospital at 9:30 PM.

294
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:20,160
Chief Shu, Director wants you to go
to his office when you have time.

295
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,140
Have you seen Ni Ke?

296
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,440
No. Hasn't he been out
of the station these days?

297
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,599
Okay, I'll be there later.

298
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,119
Shu He,

299
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,880
we need to find him as soon as possible.

300
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,560
If we don't, I'm afraid
he'll be silenced.

301
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,550
He's a veteran.

302
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:31,700
If he really wants to hide,

303
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,020
it's not that easy to find him.

304
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,000
I'll report to Director.

305
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,480
They're taking the open path.

306
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:39,720
We can't do nothing.

307
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,750
Do you have an idea?

308
00:25:42,026 --> 00:25:47,430
(Good Luck Restaurant)

309
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,380
So this is where
your brother lived before?

310
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:53,119
Since Shen Congxin's incident,

311
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,480
they've moved out.

312
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:56,440
I'm here to look for clues,

313
00:25:57,079 --> 00:25:59,000
to see if I can find Gan and Tai.

314
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,640
He lived in such a humid place,

315
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:19,480
so no wonder he's so sick

316
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:22,680
and couldn't get well.

317
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:51,550
Something's wrong.

318
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,799
I saw Bai Han withdraw money from here.

319
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,119
If they really moved out,

320
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,240
why leave a locked safe?

321
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,680
Hello, Mom.

322
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,279
Okay, we'll go back now.

323
00:27:12,379 --> 00:27:17,360
(Qi's Pharmacy, Healing hands
as warm as the spring breeze)

324
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,519
Ms. Meihua,

325
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:57,240
you called to say something important
had happened at home.

326
00:27:57,319 --> 00:27:58,400
What's going on?

327
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,160
You two

328
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,160
are hiding everything from me.

329
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,680
If I hadn't told you
there was an emergency at home,

330
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:09,400
would you have come back?

331
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,799
Mom, please don't be like this.

332
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:11,799
We've got work to do.

333
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,000
Jin,

334
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,279
what did you find out?

335
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:16,240
I got it.

336
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,559
Ni Ke's at the docks right now.

337
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,920
He's going
to follow the smugglers' boats

338
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,839
out of Buhe at night.

339
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:22,880
Ni Ke?

340
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,279
I've watched all the news.

341
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,160
Zhibai disappeared
from the police station.

342
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,119
Someone in the police force
must have a problem.

343
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:32,799
I got word

344
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:36,000
that the fat guy
had been selling houses and land,

345
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,720
and I felt something was wrong,

346
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,480
so I asked Jin to ask around.

347
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:44,799
I'll inform Shu He.

348
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:45,960
I'll come with you.

349
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:46,799
Siyuan.

350
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,880
I know

351
00:28:58,039 --> 00:28:59,640
you've been through a lot lately.

352
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:02,599
You must be in a state of confusion.

353
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,559
As I said,

354
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:08,079
whatever troubles you're facing,

355
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,559
I'm here for you.

356
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,160
I'm your strong support.

357
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,279
Thanks, Mom.

358
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,700
Are you the one
who wants to take the boat?

359
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,320
The police have surrounded this place.

360
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,440
The whole force is out there.

361
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,640
You can't get away.

362
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,640
Shu He,

363
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,559
don't force me.

364
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,640
I didn't want to do this,

365
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,720
but I didn't have a choice.

366
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:11,119
Let me go and see my family.

367
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:12,160
Stop walking forward!

368
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:13,640
I'm unarmed.

369
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:14,440
Shu He,

370
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:16,309
I know I can't talk to you

371
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,520
about friendship right now.

372
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:18,880
But we've been partners

373
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,000
for a long time,

374
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,359
so it's kind of a bond.

375
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,590
Let me go to find my family.

376
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:25,359
They're abroad.

377
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:27,440
I haven't seen them for a long time.

378
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:34,920
Why do you smile?

379
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,720
I remember

380
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,519
that you received me on my first day

381
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,839
at the police station.

382
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,480
They told me you were a veteran

383
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,440
and that I should learn from you.

384
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,599
But I was so proud of myself

385
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,519
that I said yes,

386
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,279
but all I could think was,

387
00:30:58,079 --> 00:30:59,119
"Who is he?

388
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,640
I'll make him my deputy one day."

389
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,680
Then you took me on cases and arrests

390
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:08,839
and I realized this veteran

391
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:10,359
was something.

392
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:12,109
You're my superior now.

393
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:13,620
Why are you still talking about this?

394
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,640
I've been wondering,

395
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:16,200
but now I know.

396
00:31:16,759 --> 00:31:17,880
You're hiding your flaws

397
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,960
because you're afraid

398
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,960
and you don't dare to show them.

399
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:32,680
I don't dare?

400
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,400
Believe it or not,
I'll shoot you right now.

401
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,160
I don't believe it.

402
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,550
It's not that you don't dare.

403
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:47,799
You just wouldn't.

404
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,319
Come out with me now

405
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,840
and you'll be considered
to have turned yourself in.

406
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,920
You lied to me again.

407
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:52,960
I made a bet with Liao Siyuan and Qi Xia

408
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:54,519
that you wouldn't kill me.

409
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,240
If I win, they'll buy me a meal.

410
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,079
He can save money this time.

411
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:10,039
There's one less big eater.

412
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,960
I'm still not used to it.

413
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:50,640
We used to sit over there together.

414
00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:53,079
When you first started your internship,

415
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:55,519
I sat on the left.

416
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,359
Then you became chief

417
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:00,240
and you sat on the left.

418
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,039
I never thought

419
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,240
one day...

420
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,800
One day, we'd sit face-to-face.

421
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:19,159
I'm not used to it either.

422
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:26,440
Don't waste time. Ask away.

423
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,700
How did you take Liao Zhibai away?

424
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:44,119
Around 8 PM that night,

425
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,199
I was at the hospital,

426
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,039
but I got a phone call out of the blue.

427
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,880
Na Wei called me.

428
00:34:52,983 --> 00:35:01,850
(Six hours before Liao Zhibai's death)

429
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,920
I'm going to get a bite to eat
in the neighborhood.

430
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,599
Ni Ke,

431
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,700
when you come back,

432
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,280
can you bring me a pineapple rice?

433
00:35:20,471 --> 00:35:21,119
Sure.

434
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,400
Are you crazy?

435
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,000
Liao Zhibai is in the police station,

436
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,320
and there are eyes everywhere.

437
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:32,000
I can't do this.

438
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:37,000
Don't worry.

439
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,440
I won't let him die in jail.

440
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,480
All you have to do is getting him out

441
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:48,239
of the police station
without anyone knowing.

442
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,760
I'll say it again.

443
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,199
I can't do this.

444
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,679
You can do this.

445
00:35:57,639 --> 00:35:59,480
I know you want to live in peace.

446
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,880
All these years,

447
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,599
I haven't bothered you.

448
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,960
But something done can't be undone.

449
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,000
Do you really want
to pretend it didn't happen?

450
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,880
What do you mean?

451
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,639
Everyone wants to live in peace.

452
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,280
But Liao Zhibai is a time bomb.

453
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:31,480
He won't stop

454
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,800
until everyone is blown up.

455
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:36,150
If what happened ten years ago
really came to light,

456
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,920
you and I wouldn't be able

457
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,400
to live in peace.

458
00:36:48,199 --> 00:36:49,440
It's only when it's finished

459
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,800
that no one will talk
about what happened back then.

460
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,679
I'll arrange for you to go abroad.

461
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,760
If I don't say yes,

462
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,119
I can't get out of this house?

463
00:37:18,519 --> 00:37:19,800
You've got to be kidding me.

464
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,480
I'm a law-abiding citizen.

465
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,199
But what will happen
when you get out of here?

466
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,960
Do you think you can really live?

467
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,360
I don't need to go abroad.

468
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,280
I don't need you to arrange it.

469
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,639
But I only have one request.

470
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,199
Don't touch my family.

471
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:54,000
Your call,

472
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:55,840
officer.

473
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:13,760
Two hours later,

474
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,220
the street behind the police station.

475
00:38:19,239 --> 00:38:20,199
One more thing,

476
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,199
the pen that Liao Zhibai used
to frame me

477
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:25,440
should be useless, right?

478
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:28,920
Can you bring it out for me?

479
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:37,840
After I left his place,

480
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,599
I snuck back to the station,

481
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:42,639
cut off the electricity

482
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,400
and found Liao Zhibai.

483
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,119
You're here.

484
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,400
In fact, I had prepared some drugs.

485
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,480
But he seemed

486
00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:01,000
to know I was coming.

487
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,000
He didn't resist at all.

488
00:40:04,199 --> 00:40:06,679
Then I handed Liao Zhibai
over to Tie Xin.

489
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:21,920
The police's emergency power system
has been activated.

490
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,519
They'll soon realize he's gone.

491
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:26,760
You're on your own.

492
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:28,199
Besides,

493
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,360
don't come to me anymore.

494
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,119
It's not up to me.

495
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:35,760
Thanks.

496
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:45,425
(Shu He)

497
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,920
(Simulate hospital
ambient sound to the voice call?)

498
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:52,870
(Shu He)

499
00:40:52,891 --> 00:40:53,480
(Calling)

500
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:58,400
Hello, Chief.

501
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,580
The power's out at the police station?

502
00:41:03,639 --> 00:41:04,559
I'm fine here.

503
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:05,440
Everything's fine.

504
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,880
Don't worry, I'm here.

505
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,119
Okay.

506
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:47,360
Ni Ke, you're finally back.

507
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:48,480
What took you so long?

508
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,480
I'm starving.

509
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,920
They ran out of pineapple rice,

510
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,320
so they cooked it fresh.
I waited for a while.

511
00:41:58,719 --> 00:41:59,719
That's weird.

512
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,200
So many police cars
are running around at night.

513
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,440
Did something happen?

514
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:06,920
I'll know if anything happens.

515
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:08,840
Just eat. It's all right.

516
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,960
I got back to the hospital

517
00:42:27,239 --> 00:42:28,320
after 10:30 PM.

518
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,800
I don't know anything

519
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,800
after that.

520
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,920
Do you regret it?

521
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:39,800
Yes, I do.

522
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,719
What else did you do for Na Wei?

523
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,000
The Liao family's fire
in Yong'an Village ten years ago,

524
00:42:53,159 --> 00:42:54,800
Ti Yi's case and Lang Sang's case.

525
00:42:56,599 --> 00:42:57,280
That's all.

526
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:00,480
Did you take the surveillance camera

527
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,040
that Liao Zhibai found in the bar?

528
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:04,239
It's me.

529
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,480
Why?

530
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,360
What else could it be?

531
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,480
Because I'm poor.

532
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:13,589
People like us

533
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:15,080
risk our lives out there all day long,

534
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,340
not spending any time at home.

535
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,000
Is it easy for a wife
to bring up a child

536
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:18,840
on her own?

537
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:20,440
My child is growing up,

538
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,000
and he likes more and more things.

539
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,239
How can I give him?
What can I give him?

540
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,000
That's when Na Wei approached me.

541
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,000
He knew I was short of money,

542
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,230
so he asked me to work with him.

543
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:40,159
He said I didn't have
to do anything unusual,

544
00:43:40,599 --> 00:43:41,960
just to not investigate anything.

545
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,800
For ten years I've been reminding myself

546
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,160
not to think about those things,

547
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,550
to stop thinking about those things.

548
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:49,800
As long as I'm a good person
and do my job well,

549
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:52,159
no one will know about those things,

550
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,280
and I'll still be a good police.

551
00:43:57,719 --> 00:43:58,920
But Na Wei is right.

552
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,679
Something done

553
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:06,119
can't be undone.

554
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,760
There's still a chance
if you turn state's evidence.

555
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,639
I'll plead for you in court.

556
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,800
It's no use.

557
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,440
Take my advice.

558
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,000
You can't fight him.

559
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,840
That's not something
a police should say.

560
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:32,239
Shu He,

561
00:44:36,199 --> 00:44:37,239
I never begged you, did I?

562
00:44:40,239 --> 00:44:41,119
Just one thing.

563
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:43,960
Can you not tell my son?

564
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:49,639
He bragged to his classmates at school

565
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,920
that his dad was a great police.

566
00:45:01,639 --> 00:45:02,800
I thought so too.
