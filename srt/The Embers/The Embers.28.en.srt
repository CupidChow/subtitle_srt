1
00:00:11,549 --> 00:00:18,460
(Year 1998)

2
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,239
Let's go.

3
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:41,719
Get up.

4
00:00:58,359 --> 00:00:59,079
Are you cold?

5
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:00,520
No.

6
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,120
Go to bed.

7
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,560
These are my clothes.

8
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,280
Try to see if you can wear them.

9
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:19,439
Your shoes are worn out.

10
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:22,040
I think we're about the same size.

11
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:23,400
Try them on.

12
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,780
I haven't worn them many times.

13
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:25,640
I'll do it myself.

14
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:34,840
She's so young.

15
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:37,280
Why did you go out in this weather?

16
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,040
Do they fit?

17
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,159
Yes.

18
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,319
That's good.

19
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:03,920
The rain

20
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,680
won't stop for a while.

21
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,599
Stay here

22
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,120
and get some rest.

23
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,919
Let's talk

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,039
about anything tomorrow.

25
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,080
Mom,

26
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,719
I'm hungry.

27
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:34,400
Sleep now.

28
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,920
Your stomach will stop growling
when you fall asleep.

29
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,159
Good girl.

30
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,680
Here's the thing.

31
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,760
We've received a notice of cooperation
from the police in another town.

32
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,030
This woman killed her husband.

33
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:05,960
Report any suspicious people
in your vicinity

34
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,120
as soon as possible.

35
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,159
Officer Mo,

36
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:13,560
this woman looks weak.

37
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,180
She doesn't look like a bad person.

38
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:18,680
You can't judge a book by its cover.

39
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:20,960
The man who died was a drug dealer.

40
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,479
She can't be a good person.

41
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,599
Yes.

42
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,580
Officer, you're on duty out
in the middle of the day.

43
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,520
It must be hard for you.

44
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,420
I'll get you a coconut

45
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,719
and show it to my wife.

46
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,759
Thank you, Mister.

47
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:46,839
Sir, madam,

48
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,720
my daughter is not awake yet.

49
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,600
Can you tell the officer outside

50
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,360
to keep it down

51
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,840
when he takes me away?

52
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,000
Don't wake her up.

53
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,079
We thought you were honest.

54
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,000
It's not easy for a woman
to handle a child at night,

55
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,630
so we took you in.

56
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,199
But you...

57
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,160
If I don't kill him,

58
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:26,920
we'll both die.

59
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,680
I can stand

60
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,800
this wound.

61
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,480
I don't care.

62
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:40,639
When it falls on my child,

63
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,950
I'll have to fight with my life.

64
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:48,959
Sir, madam,

65
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,160
Xia is sensible.

66
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:53,240
She is a good girl.

67
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,560
She won't give you any trouble.

68
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,560
You're both good people.

69
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,041
When I'm gone,

70
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,160
my daughter...

71
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:07,759
Mom, I'm hungry.

72
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,439
Mom.

73
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,600
Xia,

74
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,639
you go upstairs first.

75
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,920
I will make you something nice
to eat later.

76
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,639
Go upstairs.

77
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:25,959
Mom...

78
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,240
Listen to Aunt.

79
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:39,839
Good girl.

80
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,279
Go upstairs.

81
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:56,240
Sir, madam,

82
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:58,399
please take care of my daughter.

83
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,439
Get up.

84
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:00,079
Mister,

85
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:01,680
forget it if it's too much trouble.

86
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,000
I've told you many times.

87
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,680
If you're sick, get some rest.

88
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,800
Go upstairs.

89
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,920
It doesn't matter
if you don't work in the house.

90
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,000
Look, you're still feverish.

91
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,080
Is there a patient?

92
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,680
You can't work.

93
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,920
Get some rest.

94
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,439
That's one of my wife's cousins.

95
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,279
She's been here for days.

96
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:21,399
She was born to serve.

97
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,519
She's sick and still came down to work.

98
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,040
You look different after the haircut.

99
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,319
In this village,

100
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:43,759
Liao is quite honorable.

101
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,639
Besides, it's a bit remote.

102
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:48,879
Not many people come here.

103
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,879
Think of something later,

104
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,800
when things have cooled off.

105
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,360
Madam.

106
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,759
In the future,

107
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,160
you mustn't

108
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,720
do anything stupid like that.

109
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,040
Being a good person

110
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:18,800
and bringing up the child

111
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:25,519
would be the best way to repay us.

112
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,399
(I must live a good life.)

116
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,960
Siyuan,

117
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,840
anyone can accuse me of anything,

118
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,399
except you.

119
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:43,000
What are you talking about?

120
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:56,279
What is this?

121
00:10:57,679 --> 00:10:58,679
AH7.

122
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,200
It's an evolution of methamphetamine.

123
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,559
It's a new drug similar

124
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,039
to methamphetamine.

125
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,360
The hallucinogenic effect

126
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,679
is dozens of times
that of ordinary drugs.

127
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:16,080
My child's dad

128
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,600
was a chemistry genius.

129
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:22,840
It took him years of research
to come up with it.

130
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,200
There's

131
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,300
definitely money to be made in this.

132
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:33,519
But...

133
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:38,519
But it's a crime.

134
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:41,480
I'll make it.

135
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,639
But I need manpower.

136
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:54,080
In the past, you wanted a better life.

137
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:00,080
But in the past decade,

138
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:04,399
you've had countless chances to stop.

139
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,759
We didn't stop,

140
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,879
and we brought in more people

141
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:18,600
to expand production.

142
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,879
Nu Na, Tai Shu, Song En.

143
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,279
But they didn't know the formula

144
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,159
and they didn't know I existed.

145
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:30,840
Even so,

146
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,600
the formula was targeted.

147
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,240
(Year 2007)
Mr. Na Wei wants to buy the formula.

148
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:40,480
(Year 2007)
Just sell it to him.

149
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,679
When we get the money,

150
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:45,200
we'll buy back the factories
and the houses.

151
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:46,960
We'll all be able

152
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,320
to live in peace and security

153
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,159
as we used to.

154
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,480
We've already agreed on that.

155
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,279
What are you thinking about?

156
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:57,720
Let me think it over.

157
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,759
Mr. Na Wei has some urgent business
to attend to.

158
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:12,480
If you've thought it over,

159
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,039
just hand over the formula to me.

160
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:22,879
We'd still like

161
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,919
to talk to Mr. Na Wei in person.

162
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,600
I don't think that's necessary.

163
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,960
If you haven't come to an agreement yet,

164
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,960
you may leave now.

165
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,759
We understand that Mr. Na Wei wants

166
00:14:02,564 --> 00:14:03,799
to buy out the formula

167
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:05,799
and monopolize AH7.

168
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,440
But a monopoly is always exclusive.

169
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:12,080
Knowing Mr. Na Wei,

170
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,519
if we give up the formula,

171
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,519
will we be able
to walk out of here alive?

172
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,960
We won't sell the formula.

173
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,720
We can cooperate with him.

174
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,639
How would you like to cooperate?

175
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,399
In the years that followed,

176
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:18,720
because of the formula,

177
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:21,600
we and Na Wei kept each other in check,

178
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:24,200
we got what we needed,

179
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,870
and we were at peace with each other.

180
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,279
But my relationship with your dad

181
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:30,720
reached a breaking point.

182
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:34,600
Until one day,

183
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,559
Na Wei asked me to meet him

184
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,240
and then I learned

185
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:40,919
that Zhibai

186
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:45,919
had been secretly investigating
his illegitimate son, Gai De.

187
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,000
Liao Zhibai has been investigating

188
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,240
my son, Gai De.

189
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:55,360
I feel bad

190
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,279
if I don't kill him.

191
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:00,399
But if I really kill him,

192
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:03,919
Liao Nianguo
will surely fall out with me,

193
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:07,399
and our business
will be affected, right?

194
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,159
Meihua,

195
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:16,480
I'm so distressed.

196
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,120
Can you tell me

197
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,919
what I'm supposed to do?

198
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,639
Zhibai is just like my own son.

199
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,639
You know that.

200
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,159
I would never hurt him.

201
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,240
I thought

202
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,320
a woman who could kill her husband
with her own hands

203
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,039
wouldn't be so indecisive.

204
00:17:08,029 --> 00:17:14,240
(Wanted: Qi Meihua)

205
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:43,920
Na Wei didn't expect

206
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:47,160
that even without the warrant,

207
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:49,400
he'd still be dead.

208
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,359
But the moment he took it out,

209
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,279
his time of death was announced.

210
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,640
At that moment,

211
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,640
I felt like God was helping me.

212
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:06,400
I must persuade your dad

213
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,480
to ask him to come to Yong'an Village

214
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:09,880
and take this opportunity

215
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:11,880
to get rid of Na Wei.

216
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,960
Because Zhibai
has been secretly investigating.

217
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,680
Na Wei is intent on killing him.

218
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:21,640
We have no turning back.

219
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:23,960
If Na Wei doesn't die,

220
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:25,279
we will.

221
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,720
But I promised Zhibai

222
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:29,599
I'd turn myself in.

223
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:30,920
You're turning yourself in?

224
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,480
Let me ask you.

225
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:37,640
What is our daily production?

226
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,759
How many ground staff do we have?

227
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,350
How many distribution channels
do we have?

228
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,000
How many transport routes do we have?

229
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,039
Behind each number is a person.

230
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,079
You're going to get everybody killed.

231
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:00,319
Turn yourself in?

232
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:05,839
Go.

233
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,550
I'll come with you.

234
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:22,359
I realized

235
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:24,680
how cowardly and naive your dad was.

236
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,920
I was on my own.

237
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,519
Finally, I convinced him

238
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:34,240
to use the formula
to trick Na Wei into coming out

239
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,359
and then kill him

240
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:39,599
so he could turn himself in.

241
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,559
In fact, I knew

242
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:49,480
that no one would make it out
of that fire alive.

243
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,559
But God seemed to be messing with me.

244
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,839
Zhibai wasn't in the fire.

245
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,039
I know Zhibai's personality too well.

246
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,279
As long as he's alive,

247
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,519
he'll never stop investigating.

248
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,119
He'll still ruin everyone.

249
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,119
Hence,

250
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,319
Zhibai must die.

251
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:27,279
Hi, Mr. Wu.

252
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:29,349
I'm Bai Han's classmate.

253
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,240
My last name is Liao.

254
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,759
He's the one who told me about you.

255
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,160
There's something I'd like to ask you.

256
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:36,960
From the legal point of view,

257
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:40,020
if a person is involved in
the production and trafficking of drugs,

258
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,599
well,

259
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,420
apart from turning himself in,
is there any...

260
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,640
In the face of fate,

261
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,000
no one has a choice.

262
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,799
Family, friends, and children.

263
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,759
You're all my family.

264
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,519
Each one of you leaving

265
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,079
is like a sharp knife

266
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,480
through my heart.

267
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,680
Bleeding and scabbing at the same time.

268
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,039
The fire

269
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,000
burned out my past

270
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,720
and reshaped my future.

271
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,920
That night,

272
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,400
I've accepted selfishness and desire,

273
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,440
and I've gained true freedom.

274
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:32,839
What I didn't expect was

275
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:37,000
for Na Wei to make AH7 in secret.

276
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,839
I sent someone to check it out later.

277
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,119
The explosives
that destroyed the dried fruit factory

278
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:49,200
were planted almost
all over the factory.

279
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:54,119
This is not the style of Liu Haixun.

280
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,799
It's you, isn't it?

281
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,319
I warned you

282
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,720
never to touch drugs.

283
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,740
We have enough money
from Na Wei's property

284
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,880
to last us a few lifetimes.

285
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,240
Do you understand?

286
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:14,359
No drugs?

287
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:17,599
Are you kidding me?

288
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:22,000
Our business has been growing
in the past few years.

289
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:24,200
You don't really think

290
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,079
you're some kind
of business genius, do you?

291
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,759
Besides,

292
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,839
the reason I wanted your formula

293
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:36,000
in the first place was to use the drugs

294
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,440
to make connections.

295
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,519
Don't forget

296
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,079
you're not Na Wei.

297
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,079
Am I not?

298
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:10,720
He's a theater nerd and a paranoid.

299
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:14,160
He can't control himself anymore.

300
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:18,759
From the first time I saw him,

301
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:20,000
I knew it.

302
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:26,559
Hi.

303
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:33,960
I... I see you're asleep.

304
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,720
Was... Was my performance
not good enough?

305
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:44,720
Everyone's understanding
of acting is so shallow.

306
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,600
You see, when it comes to acting,

307
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,360
it's all about
whether or not you can cry.

308
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,110
Or some so-called academician.

309
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:51,200
They're always talking

310
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,079
about Brecht, which is all the rage.

311
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:56,960
But Stanley's acting system

312
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,680
is the classic.

313
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,920
Experience the character,
become the character,

314
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,559
and truly exist on stage.

315
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,160
It's not a performance,

316
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:05,640
it's a life.

317
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,359
The night Zhibai died,

318
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:10,759
I warned him

319
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,839
not to see Zhibai,

320
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,680
but he wouldn't listen.

321
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,119
I could only consider him an outcast.

322
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,079
Just like my parents.

323
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:29,400
It's different.

324
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,960
My heart didn't bleed this time.

325
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:36,240
So you knew

326
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,680
Tie Xin would have a deal
with my brother.

327
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,880
You sent someone to follow him

328
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,799
to find Gai De

329
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,960
and kill him,

330
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:49,960
then used Gai De

331
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,160
to get rid of Na Wei once and for all.

332
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,920
It's to get rid of the last person
who knew your secret.

333
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,000
The story always begins

334
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,279
with great tenderness.

335
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:26,759
From daughter to wife to mother,

336
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,200
it's almost every woman's
identity switching

337
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,039
throughout her life

338
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:35,400
in the midst of all the ups and downs.

339
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:38,880
But nothing

340
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:42,039
was the way I wanted to be

341
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,799
until

342
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:49,599
I stabbed that man,

343
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,200
and until the fire started,

344
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,599
that I learned...

345
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,599
If you dare to admit

346
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:06,279
that you're constrained,

347
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:11,720
you'll feel free.

348
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:19,400
I really want to be free.

349
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,759
From then on, I no longer have
to compromise myself,

350
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,519
I no longer have to please anyone,

351
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,000
and I no longer have to be judged.

352
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,359
I've made a lot

353
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,799
of choices and decisions that I regret,

354
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,759
but

355
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,720
thank God,

356
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,759
I've gained my freedom.

357
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,000
Ms. Meihua,

358
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,160
I know

359
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,200
the nature of the world

360
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,559
is unfair.

361
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,079
You want to fight,

362
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:21,279
you want to be free,

363
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,279
and you want to live the way
you want to live.

364
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,039
No problem.

365
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,119
But have you ever thought

366
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:30,119
about the people

367
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:34,160
who have been hurt directly
or indirectly because of you?

368
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,279
Like you,

369
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:40,519
they were a daughter

370
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,440
who had been forced
to go nowhere by her family,

371
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,880
a wife who had been tortured

372
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,599
by wrong marriages,

373
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,119
and a mother

374
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:57,039
who had taken her own life

375
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,880
to seek justice for her child
when their fates had been unjust.

376
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,480
There were even people
who were nobody,

377
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:10,000
who just wanted to be themselves

378
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:15,000
but were still being discriminated
against and thrashed by life.

379
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,960
Each one of them

380
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:22,920
was you once.

381
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,119
The knife in your hand

382
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,960
was not only stabbed

383
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,599
at the man who hurt you,

384
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,559
but also at the person you once were.

385
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:39,720
The one who struggled,
who was trapped,

386
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,039
and who was desperate.

387
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,160
Even so,

388
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,039
do you still feel free?

389
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,839
Not everyone

390
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,920
has to be someone who means something

391
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,799
to others, to society.

392
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,000
We have the right to live

393
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,480
as we please.

394
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:14,720
You have the right
to live only for yourself.

395
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,039
But there's a precondition

396
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:21,079
for that.

397
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,200
You can't hurt people.

398
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,720
It's an obsession.

399
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,039
Dead people can't be resurrected.

400
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,799
The ashes can't be rekindled.

401
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,920
But the embers can.

402
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,120
(Jin: Ms. Meihua, we're ready
and waiting for your order.)

403
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,359
Will you kill me?

404
00:32:11,339 --> 00:32:14,920
(Qi's Pharmacy, Healing hands
as warm as the spring breeze)

405
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,860
You've lost weight.

406
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,799
You don't have to visit me.

407
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:31,519
If you can't accept it,

408
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,720
don't face it.

409
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:37,680
Do what you want to do,

410
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:40,880
and live the way you want to live.

411
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,599
A girl

412
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:49,720
has to live a free life.

413
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,480
Freedom makes you happy.

414
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,039
Mom,

415
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,440
thank you for all you've done for me.

416
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:17,880
Although

417
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:22,559
you said you did it for your own sake,

418
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,360
I know the truth in my heart.

419
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:30,480
I'm sorry...

420
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,840
I couldn't protect you.

421
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:43,039
Silly girl.

422
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,920
You're the best in my heart.

423
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,920
I'm proud of you.

424
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:06,519
I have dreams too.

425
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,920
Even if it doesn't have a good start,

426
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:16,840
I'm looking forward to a good ending.

427
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:21,480
Thinking about it,

428
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:26,920
it seems like now is the best time.

429
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:32,159
Watching you grow up

430
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:36,400
and live happily

431
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,639
is my happiest ending.

432
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:51,000
Take care of you and Siyuan

433
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,400
for me.

434
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,119
Don't worry.

435
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:01,079
Siyuan and I will be fine.

436
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:06,840
We'll be healthy and happy.

437
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:13,840
You must watch it.

438
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:16,360
Okay.

439
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:19,760
I will.

440
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,000
You're a grown-up now.

441
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,159
Don't be afraid.

442
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:02,819
(Qi Meihua's sentenced to death for
intentional homicide, arson, production)

443
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:05,740
(and sale of narcotics under aggravated
circumstances using severe means.)

444
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:18,760
(Zhibai,)

445
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,690
(it's been a long time
since I've visited you.)

446
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,599
(I've been really busy
with work lately.)

447
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,280
(I didn't become a cop.)

448
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,639
(I chose to become a teacher.)

449
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:38,599
(Last week,
I asked them to write an essay.)

450
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,880
(The topic was my elder brother.)

451
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:48,840
Mr. Liao, I don't have an elder brother.

452
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:50,800
Mr. Liao, me too.

453
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,039
Mr. Liao, do you have an elder brother?

454
00:38:56,632 --> 00:38:58,793
Let's change the topic today.

455
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:00,920
Write about you.

456
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,320
Write about yourself, okay?

457
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:04,960
Okay.

458
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:07,109
These kids are so pathetic now.

459
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:08,640
They don't even have an elder brother.

460
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:11,159
Do you have one?

461
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:14,440
I have a dad.

462
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,960
(Shu He is now)

463
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,149
(an ordinary police
at the police station.)

464
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,040
Shu He, the new case files have arrived.

465
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:23,680
Go and get them.

466
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:24,160
Okay.

467
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,599
I... I'll go.

468
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:28,760
That's not appropriate.

469
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,920
All right. Get them for me.

470
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:31,320
Okay.

471
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:31,800
Thanks.

472
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:34,000
(But I've heard
that his transfer order is in,)

473
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:37,079
(so he'll be reinstated soon.)

474
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,260
(Bai Han was sentenced
to a longer term.)

475
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:41,519
(I visited him last week.)

476
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,199
(Gan and Tai are already out.)

477
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:50,239
(They've occupied the common poppy)

478
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:54,280
(and started selling flowers live.)

479
00:39:59,239 --> 00:40:01,039
(They told the story of you and Xia)

480
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,719
(to a lot of people.)

481
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:15,320
(As for Xia,)

482
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,159
(after quitting her job,)

483
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,639
(she traveled the world)

484
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,029
(and then devoted herself)

485
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:32,080
(to her research
on dissociative identity disorder.)

486
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,559
(But a couple of days ago,)

487
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,320
(she told me something out of the blue.)

488
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,159
(She found something)

489
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:56,440
(far away from here.)

490
00:41:34,447 --> 00:41:37,140
(Thanks to everyone who's been
enjoying The Embers this whole time.)

491
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,460
