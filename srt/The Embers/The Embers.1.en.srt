(Jade and Gemstone Market)

3
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,560
Song En,

4
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,679
you know what?

5
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:44,960
This is indeed the cream of the crop!

6
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,479
This will definitely

7
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:49,079
make your money worthwhile.

8
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,070
I've been in the gemstone market
for years myself,

9
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,680
and I have never seen such fine quality.

10
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,980
I believe it's worth
at least three times its price.

11
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,759
Do you want to cut it open?

12
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:57,719
Open it!

13
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:58,280
Do you?

14
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:16,239
- Open it!
- Open it!

(Buhe City Memory Competition Champion,
Liao Siyuan)

19
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,639
What's wrong with you?

20
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,800
What do you mean?

21
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,639
Are you having an amorous dream?

22
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:57,000
Still thinking about Lai La kissing you?

23
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,479
Tell me, my little brother.

24
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:00,240
Was your first kiss sweet?

25
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,840
Shut up already.

26
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,759
It's normal for a 20-year-old guy

27
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:06,159
to have dreams like that.

28
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,430
But remember to change
your underwear afterward.

29
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,879
No need to be embarrassed.

30
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,360
(I'm Liao Siyuan.)

31
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:14,360
(This chatterbox guy)

32
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:17,759
(is my brother, Liao Zhibai.)

(Buhe University)

34
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,040
(This is Buhe,)

35
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,879
(a tropical country.)

36
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,079
(As the local Chinese population grows,)

37
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,720
(aside from the local language,)

38
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:29,160
(Chinese)

39
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,600
(has gradually become
a common language here.)

40
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,759
(My brother and I)

41
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:39,680
(have been inseparable)

42
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,480
(after a fire ten years ago.)

43
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,959
(And from that day on,)

44
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,120
(my world changed.)

45
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,319
There you go.

46
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,120
You didn't wake me up again.

47
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,959
It's the next stop.

48
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,920
This is our stop.

49
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,759
Don't fool me again.

50
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,560
How about we go hang out?

51
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,560
Did you come to school

52
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,920
to meet Lai La?

53
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,480
Well, you youngsters these days.

54
00:05:18,337 --> 00:05:22,330
(Ma Luo, Liao Siyuan's classmate)

55
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,480
Isn't that your classmate, Ma Luo?

56
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,680
We're not close.

57
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:26,439
Let's leave.

58
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,519
New transfers?

59
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,279
Liao Siyuan,

60
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:38,199
how dare you lay your finger on my girl?

61
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:40,199
You must have a death wish.

62
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,160
We're not friends,

63
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,700
but we've been classmates long enough.

64
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,560
The whole class knows I like Lai La,

65
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,920
and yet you have the guts
to kiss her in public!

66
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:51,519
Let's settle this

67
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:52,800
like men.

68
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,879
You go ahead.

69
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,380
Bring it.

70
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,400
See you at the cafeteria.

71
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,440
Let me dazzle you first.

72
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,180
Have you seen kicks like this?

73
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,720
Can you take them?

74
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,839
Look at my kicks.

75
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,439
They're powerful.

76
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:05,519
The police are here! Run!

77
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:06,399
Come on. Try me.

78
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,900
What are you doing?

79
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,920
(Ni Ke, Deputy Chief
of Buhe City Criminal)

80
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,270
(Police Squad)
Liao Siyuan,

81
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,472
follow me to the station.

82
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,460
Is my sister looking for me?

83
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,079
You'll find out later.

84
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,900
Are you not scared?

85
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,759
Most people would panic

86
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:52,519
when they watch this video.

87
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,600
Do you already know something?

88
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,180
I've seen corpses since I was a kid
because of my brother.

89
00:06:58,519 --> 00:06:59,360
This is nothing.

90
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,600
Why am I here?

91
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,040
What does this have to do with me?

92
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:09,399
Do you know who the victim is?

93
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:16,879
Your classmate,

94
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,279
Lai La.

95
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,560
Who?

96
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:23,399
(Lai La's Teacher)
Lai La always dressed strangely.

97
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:24,959
She didn't have many friends

98
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,630
and didn't get along well

99
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,360
with her classmates.

100
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,950
(Did you hear it? Lai La is dead.)

101
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:34,360
(Seriously?)

102
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,069
(Yeah.)

103
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,780
(The girl who was always
in weird getups.)

104
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,560
She mixed with shady friends.

105
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:45,879
I heard she got into escorting
for money.

106
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,920
(Saw her in someone's car.)

107
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,820
(Her price was hefty.)

108
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,560
(What about her butt?)

109
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,380
(Reply 1 for more.)

110
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,270
(1)

111
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,959
The stone came in a parcel.

112
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,079
You know that.

113
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:03,519
Connections at the jade market
are complicated.

114
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,439
I still can't contact them.

115
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:07,920
Who?

116
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,319
The girl inside the stone.

117
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:10,879
I don't know her.

118
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:13,519
It was dreadful when I saw

119
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:15,360
a head in the stone.

120
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,639
Have you done a DNA test?

121
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,560
Could it be a mistake?

122
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,279
Is it possible that the police
summon you for questioning

123
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:22,480
when we can't even confirm
the victim's identity?

124
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:24,240
Liao Siyuan, listen.

125
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,680
The new chief is

126
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,879
on his way here.

127
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,000
Watch your attitude later.

128
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,159
Chief.

129
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:38,968
(Shu He, Chief of Buhe City
Criminal Police Squad)

130
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Liao Siyuan,

131
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,120
it's been a long while.

132
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,559
On behalf of Buhe City Police Station,

133
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,300
I hope you will cooperate with us.

134
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,720
My classmate is dead.

135
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,279
I will, of course.

136
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,279
But I don't want to talk to him.

137
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,000
Regarding the arson ten years ago,

138
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,320
I did nothing wrong.

139
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,159
I'd say that in front
of your brother too.

140
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,300
We are classmates from the same class,

141
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,670
and we did our social practice together,

142
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,279
but we weren't close.

143
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:37,840
When did you last see her?

144
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,080
Three days ago.

145
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,240
We visited people around Lai La.

146
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,720
According to teachers
and other classmates,

147
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,919
your relationship with the victim
wasn't simple.

148
00:09:52,248 --> 00:09:55,550
(Three Days Ago)

149
00:10:00,226 --> 00:10:05,028
(Lai La)

150
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:25,639
Oh, Lai La.

151
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,039
You dressed up nicely today.

152
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:31,000
You look even prettier

153
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,679
than before.

154
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,749
Skip that nonsense.

155
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,860
Let's exchange contacts.

156
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,799
Come on, drop your acting.

157
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,360
You think I don't know

158
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,399
what you're usually up to?

159
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,080
Jia Song.

160
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,519
It's just a contact number.

161
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,720
I'll give it to you.

162
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,240
I'll create a group chat for you two.

163
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:22,799
Chat in here.

164
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,389
Don't make a scene here.

165
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,800
We're in the middle of the session.

166
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:34,759
Three thousand a night, deal?

167
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,149
Cash or card?

168
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:46,060
Jia Song, get to the teacher's office
right now!

169
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,480
I'm so sorry, sir.

170
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,200
Someone tricked me.

171
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:55,639
Liao Siyuan.

172
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:07,840
I like you.

173
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:19,480
What is that?

174
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:20,240
Beat me.

175
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,180
I thought Lai La didn't know anyone
in the class.

176
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:22,720
Me either.

177
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,879
Are they in a relationship?

178
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,919
Were you two in a relationship?

179
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,480
I told you

180
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,639
we weren't close.

181
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:47,879
Then why did she kiss you?

182
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:54,440
How about this?

183
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,120
(Qi's Pharmacy)
We found this in Lai La's place.

184
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:02,399
You were there before the murder.

185
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,840
Were you trying to hide something?

186
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,880
I went there to deliver some medicine.

187
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:16,320
Hi, here's your medicine.

188
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:31,480
It's you?

189
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,800
My family runs this pharmacy.

190
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:38,360
You ordered painkillers.

191
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,360
What's wrong?

192
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:43,279
I... I had some stomach pain earlier.

193
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:46,919
You don't look good.

194
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,030
Need me to take you to the hospital?

195
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:51,000
I'm good.

196
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:52,919
I feel much better now.

197
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,639
Do you want to come in?

198
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:03,240
No.

199
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,519
I need to mind the shop.

200
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:06,919
Get rest early.

201
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,040
I should get going.

202
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,879
Judging the decomposition of the head,

203
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:28,039
Lai La died three days ago.

204
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:32,159
In other words,

205
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,399
she was killed right after meeting you.

206
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,540
However, according to the surveillance,

207
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,960
there was a clinic downstairs
from her place.

208
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,080
Plus, this is a common medicine
in Buhe.

209
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,030
Why didn't she just go downstairs
to buy it?

210
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,320
Could it be

211
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,200
that she was too lazy to go down?

212
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:00,200
If it wasn't for the distance,

213
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,600
could it be that there was someone
in the clinic

214
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,279
she didn't wish to see?

215
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:27,559
Chief.

216
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:31,519
We couldn't find anything useful

217
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,519
about the mine
where the raw gemstone came from.

218
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:36,159
Speaking of dismemberment cases,

219
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:38,000
by logic, other body parts

220
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,799
wouldn't be far from the head.

221
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,080
We can define a search zone

222
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,360
within a five-kilometer radius

223
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,759
of the market where the head was found.

224
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,919
The main focus isn't
the other body parts

225
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:51,240
but the head.

226
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,600
Normally, the head is

227
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,159
the hardest part to find,

228
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,080
as it identifies the victim.

229
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,159
But in this case,

230
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,869
the head was the first thing found.

231
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:01,950
It was discovered in a stone

232
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,150
at a specific time and location

233
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,590
because it intended to cause a stir.

234
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,240
People capable of doing this

235
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,390
are limited.

236
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,030
Apart from the owner of the market,

237
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,160
it could only be the buyer.

238
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,060
Of course, the other parts
are important.

239
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:15,720
Expand the search area
to the entire city.

240
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,519
The mountains, rivers,

241
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,120
abandoned factories, and landfills

242
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,340
need to be included as well.

243
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,159
Also, the murderer

244
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:24,840
went to such lengths
to prepare all this,

245
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:27,600
which shows that the murder was planned,

246
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,080
not an impromptu act.

247
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,340
Liao Siyuan mentioned
that there might be someone

248
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,890
Lai La didn't wish to see in the clinic.

249
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:35,080
That could be a clue.

250
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,120
Look into the connections

251
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,980
between the three threads
I've just mentioned.

252
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,350
Perhaps we might make discoveries.

253
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:39,799
Understood.

254
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,960
I'll get on to it now.

255
00:16:47,504 --> 00:16:50,761
(Interrogation Room)

256
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:55,960
Siyuan.

257
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:58,480
What are you doing here?

258
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:02,759
I know the police station better
than you.

259
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,279
Don't you think
everything seems strange?

260
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,000
Let's go over it again.

261
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,830
Looking back at that night,

262
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,039
something does seem off.

263
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:28,759
This wasn't her usual style.

264
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,880
She wore light makeup

265
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,799
and a white dress
she didn't normally wear.

266
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,200
Her eyes were darting.

267
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,720
She didn't make eye contact with you,

268
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,780
as if she was trying
to hide something from you.

269
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:40,119
No.

270
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,960
I need to mind the shop.

271
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,440
Get rest early.

272
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,640
I should get going.

273
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,240
These strange details

274
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:50,000
suggest that she knew

275
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,359
what was going to happen tonight.

276
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,680
She wasn't totally unaware

277
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,000
of her death,

278
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,039
but she never told you anything.

279
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,720
All these reasons

280
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,510
boil down to one possibility.

281
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:03,880
She was protecting you.

282
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:12,839
Maybe the murderer was in her room
at the moment.

283
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,440
I know

284
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,440
you're upset because of Lai La,

285
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,640
but this matter is very different

286
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,680
from what we had before.

287
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,119
This is a criminal case.

288
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,799
You're just a student.

289
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:27,960
There's nothing you can do.

290
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,960
Leave it to the police.

291
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,960
Someone like him, huh?

292
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:36,559
Let's leave the past in the past, okay?

293
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,680
You're innocent, no matter what.

294
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,559
If he really is a good cop,

295
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,279
he shouldn't have lied
and slandered you.

296
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,240
Good days, media friends.

297
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:54,039
(Ten Years Ago)
The fire that killed the Liao family

298
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,400
in Yong'an Village
drew enormous interest across society.

299
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,000
Next, we'll have
the trainee officer, Shu He,

300
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,750
who's in charge of this case,

301
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,039
report the investigation results.

302
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,119
After months of investigation,

303
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,119
we've concluded

304
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,759
that this was a vicious arson case
due to drug abuse.

305
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:12,839
The murderer is

306
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:15,540
the eldest son of the Liao family
in Yong'an Village,

307
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:16,839
Liao Zhibai.

308
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,280
He used to be a cadet
in the police academy

309
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:22,960
and had a history of drug use.

310
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,279
He was once known as a genius detective.

311
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:27,519
You're lying!

312
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:28,519
You liar!

313
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:29,640
My brother was clean!

314
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:33,119
Tell them!

315
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,680
My brother didn't use drugs!

316
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:36,680
He'd never do that!

317
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,200
Siyuan.

318
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,519
Tell them!

319
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,839
You're all liars!

320
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:46,839
Liars!

321
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:48,519
You're lying!

322
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,200
You're all liars!

323
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,400
You're all liars!

324
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:54,680
Liars!

325
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,319
Did you hear someone crying?

326
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:07,079
Ma Luo.

327
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:17,200
Are you free tonight?

328
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:43,920
What do you want me here for?

329
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:56,759
I'm off.

330
00:20:58,359 --> 00:20:58,920
Don't.

331
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:01,240
Sit down.

332
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,750
Those guys spread dirty rumors about her

333
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,160
because they couldn't be with her.

334
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,270
Lai La wasn't that kind of person.

335
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:15,960
I've liked her since I was a kid,

336
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:18,640
but she liked you.

337
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,599
She was such a nice girl.

338
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:26,480
Why?

339
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:28,240
Why?

340
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,440
Why did she have to suffer all this?

341
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:32,359
Just why?

342
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,160
She kissed you in front of everyone.

343
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:39,270
Do you know how much courage
she must've taken to do that?

344
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:42,160
And now... Now she's dead.

345
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:45,759
You react nothing at all.

346
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,880
Liao Siyuan,

347
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,759
are you actually a cold-blooded creature

348
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,359
born differently from us?

349
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,960
I wasn't once.

350
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,620
(Memory Space)
Ever since the fire ten years ago,

351
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:30,720
my world changed.

352
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,500
I can remember anything

353
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,510
that happened around me

354
00:22:36,279 --> 00:22:39,200
and store them here.

355
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:11,671
(May 29, 2009)

356
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:43,175
(Ten years ago,
Liao's residence, Yong'an Village)

357
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,000
Dad.

358
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:01,160
Mom.

359
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,599
Zhibai.

360
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:07,640
The fire took everything from me,

361
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,240
except...

362
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:34,400
Zhibai.

363
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,200
From that day on,

364
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:40,000
I could see the dead

365
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:41,480
Liao Zhibai.

366
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:43,069
Tell me, my little brother.

367
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:44,220
Was your first kiss sweet?

368
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,480
Shut up already.

369
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:57,359
Isn't that your classmate Ma Luo?

370
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,400
Siyuan,

371
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,920
leave aside the case from ten years ago.

372
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,420
It's more important to crack the case.

373
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,559
Reports say

374
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:22,799
that the head of a young girl was found
inside a rough jade

375
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,359
at a gemstone market yesterday.

376
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,880
The victim is
a female university student.

377
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,200
The police have issued a bounty

378
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,119
in search of the rest of her body parts.

379
00:25:33,383 --> 00:25:35,580
(Song En Rehabilitation Clinic)

380
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:36,279
Dr. Song,

381
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,640
thank you so much.

382
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:38,880
If it weren't for

383
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,519
the good student discount here,

384
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,750
I might not have been able
to get treated in time.

385
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:44,080
(Song En)

386
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,599
Easing the students' burden

387
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:48,079
is also a contribution to society,
isn't it?

388
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:49,839
By the way,

389
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:52,600
regarding your plans to study abroad...

390
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,140
Here.

391
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:55,039
The charity organization I run

392
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,599
is launching programs

393
00:25:56,599 --> 00:25:58,160
for students who plan to study abroad.

394
00:25:58,599 --> 00:25:59,400
For students

395
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,640
who rank at the top every semester
like you,

396
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:04,240
we will offer an insignificant sum
of financial aid.

397
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:06,720
Call me if you need it.

398
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,880
Dr. Song,
I'll head back to campus now.

399
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,240
Sure.

400
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:17,119
Mei, please see yourself out.

401
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,000
Okay.

402
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
What a coincidence.

403
00:26:24,279 --> 00:26:25,839
What brings you by, officers?

404
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:28,400
Are you feeling unwell or...

405
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,560
My colleague has overeaten this noon

406
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,960
and is having an upset stomach.

407
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,160
We happened to pass by here,

408
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,950
so I thought we could get
some medicine here.

409
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,359
Right, my stomach hurts.

410
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,440
It's happening again.

411
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,580
Prescribing common stomach medication
for me will do.

412
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,279
All right.

413
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:42,759
I'll let the nurse handle it.

414
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:43,680
Fish.

415
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:45,119
Come here.

416
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,960
Get some stomach medication
for this officer.

417
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,440
Okay.

418
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:48,920
Good.

419
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,279
I didn't know you owned this clinic.

420
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:57,160
Right. It's been years.

421
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,750
Don't be nervous.
This is not the police station.

422
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:01,920
Please sit.

423
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,279
Sure. Thank you, officer.

424
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,830
We summoned you
for questioning yesterday.

425
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,440
I hope it didn't disrupt your business.

426
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,240
Not at all.

427
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,319
Compared to a serious murder case,

428
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,920
closing my clinic for two hours

429
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,119
is nothing.

430
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:20,920
Besides,

431
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,440
my nurse was here to handle things.

432
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:27,960
Four nights ago, at 7 PM,

433
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,680
was your clinic open?

434
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,240
It was closed. I wasn't here.

435
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,760
Didn't you just say your nurse
would take care of it

436
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:36,750
if you weren't around?

437
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:37,640
Here's the medicine.

438
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:38,359
All right.

439
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,960
Your colleague's medicine.

440
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,070
Free of charge.

441
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:43,599
Thank you.

442
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:45,960
Here's the thing.

443
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,039
We attended a meeting

444
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,119
and had dinner together that night.

445
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:50,720
Right.

446
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,880
Dr. Song was drunk that day,

447
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,920
so I took him home.

448
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,079
Yeah, I forgot.

449
00:27:57,079 --> 00:27:58,599
Fish sent me home that day

450
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,070
before she headed home herself.

451
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:04,240
All right. I'll get back to work.

452
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:11,160
Is there any problem?

453
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:19,799
Nothing.

454
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,200
I'm just asking.

455
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,400
Don't be nervous.

456
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:26,640
I remember the clinic was closed
that day,

457
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,599
right?

458
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,119
Right.

459
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,140
Lai La's place is just upstairs.

460
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:51,559
It's so close.

461
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,600
You didn't ask him
about Lai La just now?

462
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,079
Why not?

463
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,480
His attitude at the police station
tells us

464
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,800
he has nothing to do with this.

465
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,860
It was a coincidence
that he became a witness.

466
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:01,799
Who?

467
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:03,680
I don't know her.

468
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,720
It seems so.

469
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,400
But when I asked him

470
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,480
if his clinic was open that night,

471
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,319
he said no.

472
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,020
The surveillance footage
shows otherwise.

473
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,720
He had no idea what our intention was,

474
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,160
yet he chose to lie.

475
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,680
Something must be off with him.

476
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,240
The person Lai La didn't wish to see

477
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,160
was probably him.

478
00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:24,440
Look into his activities these days.

479
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,940
Perhaps he could lead us
to Lai La's missing body.

480
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:27,960
All right.

481
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:45,839
Four nights ago,

482
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,720
I came back here to fetch a girl's file,

483
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,799
so the gate was open.

484
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:06,079
Since the cops are suspecting us,

485
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,640
should we put the plan

486
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,720
on hold?

487
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,700
Everything feels like
too much of a coincidence.

488
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:14,000
Why would Lai La's head be in my stone?

489
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,039
I suspect someone's digging into me.

490
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:26,640
Look into this person.

491
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,039
Who's this?

492
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:33,559
A student they brought in
for questioning.

493
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,240
It's said he's Lai La's classmate.

494
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,839
Go investigate

495
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,920
if his surname is Liao

496
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,640
and if he's from Yong'an Village.

497
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,839
Okay.

498
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,920
Did you see the news?

499
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,160
It's too gruesome.

500
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,559
Did Lai La mess with the mob?

501
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,799
It could also be her sugar daddy.

502
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,920
What sugar daddy?

503
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,160
I can tell that guy was a pimp

504
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,830
and was probably pimping her out.

505
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,960
Lai La would do anything for money.

506
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,880
I saw him before.

507
00:31:27,079 --> 00:31:28,759
He owns a clinic.

508
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,640
His car was parked right outside

509
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,160
when he picked Lai La up.

510
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,240
I saw Lai La's parents just now.

511
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,039
Some said they came to demand money.

512
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:39,680
The apple doesn't fall

513
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:41,319
far from the tree.

514
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,039
It's nothing to be surprised.

515
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,640
What are you on about?

516
00:31:45,671 --> 00:31:47,600
(Li Zhi, Liao Siyuan's classmate)

517
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,279
Are you insane?

518
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:56,079
She's already dead.

519
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:57,200
Can you stop insulting her?

520
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,820
She was indecent herself,

521
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,920
and now her parents are
embarrassing themselves here.

522
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,319
What I just said is superficial.

523
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,700
I'm holding back, you know?

524
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,240
You!

525
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,640
Why? Want to beat me?

526
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,400
Jia Song.

527
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,680
Did you forget how you were punished

528
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,640
because of the message
you sent to the director?

529
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,440
Stay out of this...

530
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:18,960
I'd have forgotten it

531
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,559
if you hadn't brought it up.

532
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:22,359
Perfect timing.

533
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:23,799
I should just deal with you too.

534
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,119
Buhe University Code of Conduct.

535
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:29,000
Section 11, Article 8.

536
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,220
If any violent behavior is registered

537
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,240
during academic probation,

538
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,720
the student will be expelled.

539
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,590
Maybe you should think about it.

540
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,000
Why are you taking off your watch?

541
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,200
Put it back on.

542
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:46,720
Let's go.

543
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,119
Impressive.

544
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:04,000
You were quick-witted.

545
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,040
I just don't want my friend
to be slandered

546
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:06,880
with dirty rumors

547
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,079
when she's already gone.

548
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,350
What were they talking about?

549
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,440
What's the matter with Lai La's parents?

550
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:19,580
Oh, right.

551
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,000
Our teacher was looking for you.

552
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,640
She wanted you to be
in the meeting room.

553
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,420
You should go now.

554
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,359
My daughter has died.

555
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:29,640
Why are you talking about this?

556
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:32,759
If your daughter dies,

557
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:34,759
would her life only be worth 60,000?

558
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:36,160
60,000?

559
00:33:37,079 --> 00:33:38,079
60,000, seriously?

560
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:39,079
That's enough.

561
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,799
Well, our request is simple.

562
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,920
My daughter used to send me
4,000 puna every month.

563
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,100
We demand that the school

564
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,550
pay us ten years' worth of that

565
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,440
as compensation

566
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,000
and some compensation for mental trauma.

567
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,839
It's only

568
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,519
800,000.

569
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,599
It shouldn't be a hefty sum to a school.

570
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,559
Right?

571
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,680
We... We really understand

572
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,400
you must be very upset.

573
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,440
But the reality is

574
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,640
Lai La died outside the school.

575
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,000
We aren't legally responsible for now.

576
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,119
How is that?

577
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,149
My daughter's body is barely cold,

578
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,900
and you're trying to evade responsibility?

579
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:19,840
Well,

580
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,159
he's Lai La's friend.

581
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:24,199
He was summoned for questioning.

582
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:26,760
He can explain the situation to you.

583
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,780
I don't want to hear it.

584
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,400
He's only a teenager. What can he know?

585
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:34,159
We're here to demand compensation.

586
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,039
My daughter is dead, right?

587
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,360
We're here for the money.

588
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,559
It has nothing to do with him.

589
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:45,920
Ma'am,

590
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,840
do you know

591
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,599
what Lai La's grades are this semester?

592
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:54,840
What does that have to do with me?

593
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,940
Do you know where the money
she sent you every month

594
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:57,550
came from?

595
00:34:57,559 --> 00:34:59,199
I don't want to hear this.

596
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:00,599
Your new phone

597
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,840
must be paid by Lai La, right?

598
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,400
Do you know the screen

599
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,200
of her old phone was cracked
for six months,

600
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,520
and she didn't even replace it?

601
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,039
What's it to you?

602
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,400
Get out.

603
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:17,880
Out.

604
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,440
So all you care about is

605
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:25,159
how much you can get from Lai La's death?

606
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:26,719
You care nothing about

607
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:27,679
how she died

608
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:29,280
and why.

609
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,920
What are you talking about?

610
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,440
Who are you? You're spewing nonsense.

611
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,620
I want you to get out of here.

612
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:36,480
Get out!

613
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,440
This is my family business.

614
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:40,199
It's none of your business.

615
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:41,920
Lai La...

616
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:43,960
Lai La is my daughter.

617
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,440
I gave birth to her.

618
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,239
She's my flesh and blood.

619
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,559
She was your ATM when she was alive

620
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:56,000
and now your sweetheart when she died,

621
00:35:57,159 --> 00:35:57,840
right?

622
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,400
Who's this person?

623
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,320
She's my daughter,

624
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:22,440
but I demand more money.

625
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,679
What's wrong, Siyuan?

626
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:31,590
Stop thinking about that.

627
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:38,880
I really had no idea

628
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,239
this was what she had been through.

629
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,580
Clearly, she tried to tell me something
that night

630
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:47,639
when I delivered the medicine.

631
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:53,199
Do you want to come in?

632
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:55,639
No.

633
00:36:56,559 --> 00:36:57,880
I need to mind the shop.

634
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,280
Get rest early.

635
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,280
I should get going.

636
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,559
Liao Siyuan.

637
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:05,880
Yes?

638
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:09,880
Thank you for letting me join

639
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,320
your social practice team.

640
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,920
If not, I would've been left out again.

641
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,639
You're welcome.

642
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,360
We can team up again next time.

643
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,079
Sure.

644
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:22,480
Thank you.

645
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:23,960
Bye.

646
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:36,960
I didn't stay

647
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:39,880
because I wasn't brave enough
to face her feelings.

648
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,199
If the murderer was inside,

649
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,320
would her request

650
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:47,920
be the last cry for help?

651
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,920
If I had just asked her

652
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,000
or cared a little more,

653
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:56,679
would she...

654
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,039
Would she still be alive?

655
00:38:03,676 --> 00:38:06,917
But you couldn't have
predicted everything.

656
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:10,880
Zhibai,

657
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:14,800
having her head cut off

658
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,519
must've hurt a lot, right?

659
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:35,800
Teach me how to investigate.

660
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,110
I thought you always
wanted to avoid this.

661
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:47,679
But Lai La can't just die

662
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:48,840
for no reason.

663
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:52,760
I hate seeing her parents

664
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,119
leech off her

665
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,679
or hearing insults

666
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,560
and disrespectful speculation

667
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,020
from irrelevant people.

668
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:08,559
I want Lai La to know

669
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,420
that even though she's no longer alive,

670
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,519
at least someone in this world

671
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,000
cares about what she went through.

672
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:22,480
I care

673
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:24,400
what others don't.

674
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:27,920
I demand justice for her

675
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:30,760
when no one else will.

676
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:32,280
But Siyuan,

677
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,110
once you make this decision,

678
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,480
you'll see a completely different world

679
00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:38,559
under this broad daylight.

680
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,960
You'll witness
the cruelest side of humanity,

681
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:45,159
and you might lose trust
in people forever.

682
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,280
There's no turning back.

683
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:49,800
The moment you take this step,

684
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,840
you can never return.

685
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:57,480
Even so,

686
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,719
do you still want to become

687
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:00,920
a sleuth?

688
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,559
What's a sleuth?

689
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,039
Oh, bro.

690
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,360
Did you forget all those books

691
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,690
I made you read when we were kids?

692
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:14,280
A sleuth is a detective.

693
00:40:14,519 --> 00:40:15,280
But I prefer

694
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,400
the term sleuth.

695
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,880
It sounds more poetic

696
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:18,800
and refined.

697
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,680
Enough. Stop rambling.

698
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,380
Let's get started.

699
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,440
"Detective" is so overused.

700
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,960
Sherlock Holmes is a great detective,

701
00:40:23,079 --> 00:40:24,519
but I'm a sleuth,

702
00:40:24,519 --> 00:40:26,239
and you're too.

703
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,960
It just sounds cooler.

704
00:40:28,197 --> 00:40:29,837
Argh, "detective" is played out.

705
00:40:51,374 --> 00:40:55,160
(Fish)

706
00:40:59,000 --> 00:40:59,800
I found something.

707
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:01,199
His name is Liao Siyuan.

708
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,120
He's from Yong'an Village,
just like you.

709
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,719
So it's really their second son.

710
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:08,599
Looks like he's after me.

711
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,199
After you?

712
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,280
Do you have a beef with him?

713
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,960
A blood feud, I'd say.
