1
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:16,510
(May 25, 2009)
Thank you.

2
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:20,000
(May 25, 2009)

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,079
Here, take this.

4
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,480
Oh, right.
Since Lang Sang isn't here yet,

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,940
let's discuss something.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,340
Isn't he opening his shop soon?

7
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,300
Should we think about

8
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,880
getting him something for the occasion?

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,560
A flower stand?

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,600
People usually
send flower stands for openings.

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,280
It looks grand.

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,280
That's too cliche.

13
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:37,679
Then suggest something better.

14
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,840
How about a lion dance?

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,200
I happen to know someone in Chinatown.

16
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,700
He's a respected elder from Guangdong.

17
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,100
His family has been showing traditional
southern lion dances.

18
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,340
We can invite them over
and make it a lively event.

19
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,320
Lang Sang isn't from Guangdong.

20
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,719
What if he finds it too noisy?

21
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,320
Isn't a grand opening
supposed to be lively?

22
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,840
I'll be straightforward.

23
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,640
Go ahead.

24
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,119
A...

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,519
A...

26
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,359
A red envelope.

27
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:07,959
That works.

28
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,200
A red envelope is a good idea.

29
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,120
Let's go with that.

30
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,200
Right?

31
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,640
Plus, his shop just opened.

32
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,490
He probably needs money
the most right now.

33
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,000
Instead of giving something symbolic,

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,400
we might give him something useful.

35
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,600
Something he can actually use.

36
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,400
- Right?
- Exactly.

37
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,359
All right.

38
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:25,920
What's wrong?

39
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,100
I don't know why,
but my heart is racing.

40
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:36,640
I've been feeling uneasy all night.

41
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:12,439
Sorry.

42
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,879
We haven't officially opened yet.

43
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,639
Please help me.

44
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:18,360
I beg you... Please save me.

45
00:03:43,262 --> 00:03:52,010
=The Embers=

46
00:03:53,955 --> 00:03:56,500
=Episode 21=

47
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,360
It's late.

48
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,080
Why did you call me over so urgently?

49
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,520
I found something while researching.

50
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,800
Ten years ago,
there was a girl named Ti Yi.

51
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,800
She was one of the victims
in a convenience store murder case.

52
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,680
(Liao Zhibai submitted evidence)
The drug she was using

53
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,160
(on May 28th.)
at the time was AH7.

54
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,860
(Not considered due to lost evidence.)

55
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,560
And Liao Zhibai and Ti Yi...

56
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,759
They had a connection.

57
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:24,319
Based on the previous cases,

58
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,920
Ti Yi's appearance is no coincidence.

59
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:29,959
She was deliberately placed here.

60
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:32,360
The case from ten years ago...

61
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,600
It's very likely
the starting point of everything.

62
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:40,240
The incident happened on May 25.

63
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,000
Do you remember that day?

64
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,439
I do. I remember it very clearly.

65
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,520
That day, I was temporarily assigned
to assist in another city.

66
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,519
I saw them at school.

67
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:55,680
It was about Lang Sang's exam.

68
00:04:58,439 --> 00:04:59,720
We even got into a fight.

69
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:03,920
Serves you right for running your mouth.

70
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,560
What? Not going to fight back?

71
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,600
Think you're tough?

72
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,199
Fighting in school
is a serious violation.

73
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,880
If I fight back, I'd be just like you.

74
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:19,749
Just like us?

75
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,870
That's worth another beating.

76
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:21,759
Stop it.

77
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,360
It wasn't him.

78
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,070
How could it not be him?

79
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,879
If he hadn't reported it,

80
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,920
Lang Sang wouldn't have failed the exam.

81
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,780
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

82
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,120
Quit acting.

83
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,759
I was right outside the teacher's office

84
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,160
when you went to snitch.

85
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,480
I heard he mention Lang Sang's name.

86
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,759
It really wasn't him.

87
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:44,120
He went there to submit Lang Sang's
scholarship documents.

88
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,839
Sorry, we got it wrong.

89
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,390
About what just happened...

90
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,519
I'll report it to the school as it is.

91
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,439
Say...

92
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:02,189
You're not...

93
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,420
You're actually threatening us?

94
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,360
I'll beat you to death!

95
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:04,870
Enough.

96
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:06,199
Let's go find Lang Sang and eat.

97
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,199
Lang Sang?

98
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,280
Is this the Lang Sang you mean?

99
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,399
Yes.

100
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,190
He was our classmate
at the police academy.

101
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,759
He was close to your brother.

102
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,199
Before graduation,
I heard news of his death.

103
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,480
It was shocking at the time.

104
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,100
But I didn't think too much about it.

105
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:37,680
This says he
was caught soliciting prostitutes.

106
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,959
He got into a dispute over the price
with a sex worker named Ti Yi.

107
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:43,600
In the end, they killed each other.

108
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:47,519
I remember that day.

109
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:50,399
They said they were going out together.

110
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,759
How could Lang Sang
have ended up soliciting a prostitute?

111
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,560
Something still feels off.

112
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:05,639
A man and a woman killing each other...

113
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:09,199
Could they really
have both died in the struggle?

114
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,079
The report states

115
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:13,720
that Lang Sang died
from a skull fracture.

116
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:15,279
He had only one fatal injury.

117
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,959
But Ti Yi was different.

118
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,639
Her body had multiple wounds.

119
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,839
A woman who was 163 cm tall

120
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:23,959
and weighed only 47 kg...

121
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,000
Could she really,

122
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,480
while severely injured and drugged,

123
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,800
have lifted a heavy hammer

124
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,040
and killed a grown man?

125
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,720
I know what's wrong.

126
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:53,120
There were fingerprints at the scene,
but no footprints.

127
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:01,199
Because footprints are hard to fake.

128
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,439
They must have been wiped clean.

129
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,830
There had to be
a third person at the scene.

130
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:07,000
Maybe even a fourth.

131
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:11,480
That person is the real murderer.

132
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:16,800
Based on the patterns
of past cases orchestrated

133
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,639
by this so-called mystery figure,

134
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:22,279
every victim was one of the perpetrators
in the arson case years ago.

135
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,360
If we reverse the logic...

136
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,680
Ti Yi appeared as if she
had come from ten years ago.

137
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,360
Who has fallen into a trap because of her?

138
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,360
Who has been closely linked to Tie Xin?

139
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,200
Who has, without realizing it,

140
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,879
suddenly become the center of attention?

141
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,639
Gai De.

142
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:54,320
So Gai De was also involved
in the fire ten years ago, right?

143
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,120
They put AH7 in my water cup.

144
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,860
Then they called the police immediately,

145
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,799
and forced me to take a urine test.

146
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:09,799
That drug test report

147
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,799
was fabricated so easily.

148
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:15,080
I have another question.

149
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,120
Back in the police academy,

150
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,480
how did my brother
get involved with drugs?

151
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,399
I don't know the details.

152
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:24,000
But today,
I ran into one of his friends.

153
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,960
He might know something.

154
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:31,000
Oh, right.

155
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,260
Everything we agreed on
is still fine, right?

156
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,080
Jiu, stop playing.

157
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,510
Take your brother to wash his hands.

158
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,480
It's time for dinner.

159
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:48,120
Come on, let's eat.

160
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:58,519
Here.

161
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,240
Bless Jiu.

162
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:21,919
Honey.

163
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,320
Bless Jiu.

164
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,600
Let's eat.

165
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,759
Nuo Li.

166
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:38,240
I have a task for you.

167
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,080
Okay.

168
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,720
I have to step out for a bit.

169
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,960
Can you help me watch over Jiu
and make sure he eats?

170
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:43,600
All right?

171
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,559
Sure, no problem.

172
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:45,360
It's a man's promise.

173
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:46,679
Dad, where are you going?

174
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:48,000
Take a guess.

175
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,960
To buy me something delicious?

176
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,720
All you think about is food.

177
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,600
You definitely got that from me.

178
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,039
I'm heading out.

179
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:02,879
Dad.

180
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:07,960
Come back soon.

181
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:09,480
You didn't even eat breakfast.

182
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,080
Okay.

183
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,679
Have you eaten?

184
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:29,080
Good morning.

185
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:29,879
Good morning.

186
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,759
Good morning.

187
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:32,240
Good morning.

188
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:37,440
You left so early?

189
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,200
Good morning.

190
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,279
Let's talk here.

191
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,360
You really were a top student
at the academy.

192
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,320
When did you notice me?

193
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,639
Probably when I was cracking the eggs.

194
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,399
Not bad.

195
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,480
No wonder you are Liao Zhibai's brother.

196
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,960
Cut the nonsense.

197
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,260
I'll get straight to the point.

198
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:25,159
Why did you help Ti Yi frame Gai De?

199
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,039
Who?

200
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,519
I don't know Ti Yi.

201
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:36,120
I checked her call records.

202
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,200
I also monitored her daily movements.

203
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:41,879
But I never found out

204
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:43,440
how she contacted her accomplice.

205
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:45,080
Until one time...

206
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:47,559
While following Ti Yi,

207
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,440
I spotted a familiar face.

208
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,080
What are you doing here?

209
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:57,559
Jiu.

210
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:00,320
Who are you?

211
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,759
I've never seen you before.

212
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:04,039
Nuo Li.

213
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:06,080
She's my friend.

214
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,200
All right, then. I'll leave you to chat.

215
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,399
I haven't seen you in so long.

216
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,480
Did you miss me?

217
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,240
Why is your face dirty?

218
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,080
Let me wipe it for you.

219
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,879
There, all clean.

220
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,799
Here, take this. Eat up.

221
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,320
Will you come again tomorrow?

222
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,000
Jiu.

223
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:22,440
Do you remember me?

224
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,120
You're Liao Siyuan.

225
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,879
You helped me last time.

226
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:29,480
You still remember me.

227
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:32,679
Who told you my name?

228
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,360
My dad told me.

229
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:39,919
I have a question for you.

230
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,039
The lady who was with you just now...

231
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,720
Do you know her?

232
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,320
Yes, she's really nice.

233
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,720
She always gives me candy.

234
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,639
Look.

235
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,200
I bought

236
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,120
three different flavors just now.

237
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,399
Want to trade this one for mine?

238
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,200
I have plenty at home.

239
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,559
This one is for you.

240
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,759
Really?

241
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:10,320
Thank you.

242
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,620
Here, take these three too.

243
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,780
Jiu, time to go home.

244
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,200
Dad.

245
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,080
Dad.

246
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:20,039
My little one.

247
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,150
I missed you so much.

248
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,840
Sorry, Dad came late today.

249
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,360
Dad, I saw that brother

250
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,600
who helped me last time.

251
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:26,159
Where?

252
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:26,759
Look.

253
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,120
He was just here.

254
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,960
It's all right. Let's go home first.

255
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,679
Come on, let's go.

256
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,679
Did Jiu get into any trouble today?

257
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,039
Of course not.

258
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:44,960
Good.

259
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,890
What do you want to eat?

260
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,500
I'll take you
out for something tasty.

261
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:56,717
(Thank you. Goodbye. Leaving.)

262
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,320
Making a child do something like this...

263
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,159
Isn't that too much?

264
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,320
That's just your assumption.

265
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:14,799
You're accusing me of a candy wrapper?

266
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:20,120
A candy wrapper alone
can't prove anything.

267
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:22,279
But you got too into your role.

268
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:24,879
While pretending to be Gai De,

269
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:27,519
you left some of your hair
at the crime scene.

270
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:31,200
It got caught in static
on a nearby lamp.

271
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,519
Mr. Gai De.

272
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:50,879
Working late again?

273
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,319
Let's begin.

274
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,440
Do we really have to go this far?

275
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,839
If we don't...

276
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,559
The police won't believe it.

277
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:07,640
Everything that belonged
to Gai De is here.

278
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:07,720
Why did you help her?

279
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:12,440
Why else?

280
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:14,160
For the money.

281
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,960
You saw it yourself.

282
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,440
Look at my living conditions.

283
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,839
I have a daughter.

284
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:20,480
I need to provide for my family.

285
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:22,119
As for Ti Yi...

286
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,680
She was drowning
in gambling debt years ago.

287
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:26,440
To pay it off,

288
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:27,880
she would do anything.

289
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:28,960
She had nothing to lose.

290
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,279
Between us,

291
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,960
it was just mutual exploitation.

292
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:34,599
We each got what we needed.

293
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,279
You're lying.

294
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,039
If you were really just after money,

295
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,400
you could have worked

296
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,319
with a young and pretty girl instead.

297
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,000
Why did you choose Ti Yi?

298
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,920
You're too naive.

299
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:58,200
Sexually assaulting a young girl...

300
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,070
Doesn't that pale in comparison

301
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:02,279
to doing the same to an old,
washed-up woman?

302
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:03,680
It makes for a much bigger scandal.

303
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,119
But Ti Yi died ten years ago.

304
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,079
Why use her name?

305
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:17,880
Liao Zhibai taught you that.

306
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,440
He reached out to you in secret.

307
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,680
You two are working together.

308
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:23,839
Aren't you?

309
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,880
What really happened between you
and my brother ten years ago?

310
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,799
I'll tell you the truth.

311
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:36,079
Liao Zhibai never used drugs back then.

312
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,039
The drugs they took...

313
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,640
I was the one who gave them.

314
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:07,960
Chief.

315
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,720
The lab report on the light bulb is out.

316
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,640
The hair analysis
identified it as Su Taipu's.

317
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,580
The case from ten years ago...

318
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,279
What really happened?

319
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:07,880
Lang Sang is already dead.

320
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,680
Your brother's reckless actions

321
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:12,720
dragged us all down with him.

322
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:19,759
What more do you want?

323
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:25,640
All the evidence, testimony,
and reports align.

324
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,000
There are no discrepancies.

325
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,549
The police are ready to close the case.

326
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:32,140
There are still unanswered questions.

327
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,079
We can't close it yet.

328
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:35,759
Sir,

329
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:37,440
Lang Sang was your student too.

330
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,100
You taught him for four years.

331
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:40,559
Even if he wasn't a top student,

332
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,880
he would never do drugs

333
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,880
or solicit prostitutes.

334
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,680
Liao Zhibai.

335
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,480
I understand how you feel.

336
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,359
But acting out like this...

337
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,880
won't change anything.

338
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:56,000
You've already violated protocol
by accessing the crime scene

339
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:57,200
and questioning witnesses.

340
00:22:57,319 --> 00:22:58,240
I won't pursue it.

341
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,079
But I need you to remain objective.

342
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:01,480
Leave now.

343
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,839
I am not being irrational.

344
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,030
Nor am I acting on emotions.

345
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:05,359
I just want the truth.

346
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:06,720
Sir,

347
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,320
there are too many inconsistencies.

348
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,440
If I don't pursue them,

349
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:10,880
how can we confidently say

350
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,599
to others that we're good police officers

351
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:13,759
to protect everyone.

352
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:15,279
Please, Sir.

353
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,559
Give me a chance.

354
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:19,359
Just give me time.

355
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,880
I will find the truth for Lang Sang.

356
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:30,920
All right. I'll cover for you.

357
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:34,359
Three days. Just three days.

358
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,340
If there's still no new evidence,

359
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,559
then this case

360
00:23:38,839 --> 00:23:39,880
will be closed.

361
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:41,119
Three days.

362
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,319
I will uncover the truth.

363
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,000
Thank you, Sir.

364
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:54,119
Are you saying

365
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:55,279
that girl was raped

366
00:23:55,319 --> 00:23:57,319
and then chased
all the way to Lang Sang's shop?

367
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:01,200
That poor girl...

368
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,160
I actually wanted to help her.

369
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,420
(Liu Haixun)
But I was just a security guard.

370
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,119
(Liu Haixun)
What could I do?

371
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:10,440
It's not too late now.

372
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,480
If you get me the surveillance footage
from the hallway,

373
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:15,640
I can clear his name.

374
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:21,119
Are you worried

375
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,839
that helping me will cost you your job?

376
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:33,400
Take this.

377
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:33,759
No.

378
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:34,440
There's money.

379
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,400
It's not that I don't want to help you.

380
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:38,920
You don't understand.
This place is filthy.

381
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,620
I don't want to be here anymore.

382
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,260
They mess around in there every day.

383
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,520
The security cameras
were never even turned on.

384
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,960
So there's no other evidence?

385
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:53,640
Oh, right.

386
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,519
When they were leaving that night,

387
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,519
I overheard two of them talking.

388
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:01,039
"Such fair legs.

389
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,160
Even through the screen,
I want to touch them."

390
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:06,920
I think they installed cameras

391
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:08,279
in the room

392
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:10,000
and recorded something.

393
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,279
I'll go back and check.

394
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:15,079
See if I can find anything.

395
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:16,960
I'll try.

396
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:18,400
No matter what it takes,

397
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,720
I need that footage.

398
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:21,279
No.

399
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:22,839
Just take it.

400
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,039
Take it.

401
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,559
All right, I'll try.

402
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:27,720
I'll do my best.

403
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,200
If I find anything,

404
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,000
I'll send it straight to the police.

405
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,559
That's him, Sir.

406
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:37,680
Just like his father, stubborn as hell.

407
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:41,280
If he keeps digging,
he'll be in trouble sooner or later.

408
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,599
Might as well get rid of him now.

409
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,799
Killing him is easy.

410
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:48,880
But dealing with his father's
business won't be.

411
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,279
He's just a kid.

412
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:53,240
A warning should be enough.

413
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,960
All right, I understand.

414
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:01,160
Liao Zhibai!

415
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,310
You haven't even graduated yet.

416
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:05,589
You haven't even put on the uniform.

417
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:07,420
And you're taking matters
into your own hands?

418
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:09,470
Retrieving surveillance
from private establishments?

419
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,590
That's illegal!

420
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,200
And you even bribed someone.

421
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,110
Have I been too lenient with you?

422
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,440
Sir.

423
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:20,759
I admit my methods of obtaining evidence

424
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,599
weren't legal or proper.

425
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:24,839
I'm willing to accept any punishment.

426
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,680
But we did find evidence.

427
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,240
Ti Yi was already injured

428
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,460
before she got to the shop.

429
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:31,759
Just look at the footage.

430
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:32,359
Enough.

431
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,880
The hard drive you sent was empty.

432
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,920
So, of course,
whatever you say must be true!

433
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,920
How do I know

434
00:26:39,319 --> 00:26:41,200
if you didn't find anything at all?

435
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:43,200
That you were just running out of time

436
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,880
and decided to play a little trick,

437
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,160
handing me a blank drive as a distraction?

438
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:50,880
Then why don't you
check the street cameras

439
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,720
near the bar?

440
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,780
There must be something on them.

441
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,920
You think I haven't?

442
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:56,640
The bar's surveillance is gone.

443
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,440
They said early this morning,

444
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:00,480
that someone stole the footage!

445
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,559
Funny thing is,
stealing surveillance footage...

446
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,880
You have a record of that.

447
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:09,920
No, sir.

448
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,480
We never...

449
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,319
Shut up!

450
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,799
All right, enough.

451
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:18,559
Can we still find that security guard?

452
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:21,000
Can he still testify for us?

453
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:24,200
We looked.

454
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,680
He's already resigned.

455
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:29,820
I'd guess he was afraid
of getting dragged into this.

456
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,920
So he ran first.

457
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,400
I'll keep looking.

458
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:47,079
Su Taipu.

459
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,720
Su Taipu!

460
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:51,839
Coming.

461
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:54,920
Why are you shouting? What's wrong?

462
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:56,559
Didn't I tell you to tell the boss

463
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,920
that this fan is broken
and needs replacing?

464
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:01,120
I did. He said he'd get someone
to fix it in two days.

465
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,400
Two days? How many days is that?

466
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:02,880
Two days!

467
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,160
How many days do you mean?

468
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,319
I told him already!

469
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:06,039
Did I tell you?

470
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:06,519
I did!

471
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:07,400
Did I tell you or not?

472
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:07,940
What's wrong?

473
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,030
Did I tell you or not?

474
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,820
What's up with you?
Did you eat gunpowder?

475
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:11,460
I did!

476
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:21,119
I'm sorry.

477
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,480
Sit.

478
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:24,960
Sit.

479
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:28,000
Sit.

480
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,039
I'm sorry.

481
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:40,799
I know you're all upset.

482
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:43,640
But we have to clear Lang Sang's name.

483
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,510
The most crucial piece
of evidence is missing now.

484
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,640
So we need to stay calm.

485
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,720
All right?

486
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:56,359
This case

487
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:58,799
is far more complicated than we thought.

488
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,440
I suspect

489
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,200
we've crossed a line

490
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,480
with people we shouldn't have.

491
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:06,880
So...

492
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,640
If anyone wants out,

493
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,119
you can leave now.

494
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:13,400
I'm not backing out.

495
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,799
Lang Sang is already dead.

496
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:20,680
We can't just let it go.

497
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,039
That's right.

498
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,119
We're not letting this go.

499
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:40,480
Wherever you go, I go.

500
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,519
All right.

501
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,559
The next few days are critical.

502
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,440
We don't have much time.

503
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,559
We have to give this case

504
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:57,279
our undivided attention.

505
00:29:58,279 --> 00:29:59,839
We owe Lang Sang the truth.

506
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,160
No stopping until we win.

507
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,400
No stopping until we win. Cheers.

508
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,580
No stopping until we win.

509
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:08,160
To Lang Sang.

510
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:15,720
Nobody moves!

511
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,440
Stay still!

512
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,799
Sit down!

513
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:22,200
Everyone, sit down!

514
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:23,440
What's going on?

515
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,000
Don't ask.

516
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,580
You have to tell us what's happening!

517
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,320
Take them away.

518
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:27,240
Wait...

519
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:37,720
Take them!

520
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:38,839
Move! Now!

521
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:39,960
Go!

522
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,640
Why did you poison them?

523
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:03,160
Why did you betray them?

524
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:06,559
Weren't they your best friends?

525
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,279
My fiancee has cancer.

526
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:09,440
She needed a lot of money.

527
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,180
Poisoning them
was the only way I could survive.

528
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:15,480
I crossed the wrong people.

529
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,000
Staying alive became my priority.

530
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,599
And I got a huge payout in return.

531
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:21,640
Why wouldn't I do it?

532
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,180
I'm not as stupid as your brother.

533
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,960
What was in the surveillance footage?

534
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,400
Who was the real murderer of Ti Yi?

535
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,960
Was it Gai De's brother?

536
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:54,720
Brother? What brother?

537
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,070
I'm the security guard here.

538
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,780
I know you were tricked into coming.

539
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,720
Listen to me.

540
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,480
You can't leave until the time is up.

541
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,759
Wait here.

542
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,000
I'll get you out, all right?

543
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,000
Just wait here.

544
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,880
What are you trying to do
in broad daylight?

545
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:32,160
Broad daylight?

546
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,620
How do you write that?

547
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:36,720
“Guang.”

548
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,880
As in “naked.”

549
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:40,200
“Tian.”

550
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,279
Because our great Mr. Gai De is the sky.

551
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,559
Leaving without saying goodbye?

552
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:55,279
Isn't that a little rude?

553
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,480
Your mother...

554
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:04,920
Your mother

555
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:07,799
didn't teach you any manners?

556
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,519
From start to finish, it was only Gai De.

557
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,960
You've been tricked, kid.

558
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,800
Tell me...

559
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:30,070
Do you think he deserves to die?

560
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,960
Too bad all the evidence
was destroyed because of your testimony.

561
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,679
Liao Siyuan.

562
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,159
What do you think is more important?

563
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,039
The truth or punishing the killer?

564
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,800
The person who was
at the crime scene that night

565
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:12,400
was not Gai De.

566
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:25,639
There's no time to waste.
Arrest him now.

567
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,960
We need to release Gai De
as soon as possible.

568
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,260
Handle the aftermath properly.

569
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,239
Director.

570
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,150
There are still
other suspicions about Gai De.

571
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,340
We can't release him.

572
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:37,920
What suspicions?

573
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:40,560
I suspect he's connected
to the murder case from ten years ago.

574
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Do you have any evidence?

575
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,440
Not yet.

576
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:49,519
Then arrest him when you find it.

577
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:50,599
According to procedure,

578
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:52,320
we have to release him now.

579
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:00,400
Understood.

580
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,440
Mr. Gai De.

581
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,220
Can you tell us
the details of this case?

582
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,040
Mr. Gai De.

583
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,719
Justice may be delayed,

584
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,119
but it will never

585
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,280
be absent.

586
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,800
Dad, I'm heading to school.

587
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,159
Jiu, wait.

588
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:03,920
Come here first.

589
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,000
Do these uncles look cool?

590
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,440
They're okay. Not as cool as you, Dad.

591
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,239
Today,

592
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,000
I might not be able
to pick you up from school.

593
00:38:58,559 --> 00:38:59,519
If you see

594
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:01,480
any of the uncles in this photo,

595
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,920
you can go with them.

596
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,679
Got it?

597
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,400
Who are they?

598
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:10,280
That's a good question.

599
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:14,159
They...

600
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:17,760
They...

601
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,760
You can call them godfathers.

602
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:28,440
One, two, three, four, five.

603
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,519
All of them?

604
00:39:32,599 --> 00:39:33,559
All of them.

605
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,119
That many?

606
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,280
Go on.

607
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:46,119
Bye-bye.

608
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:47,519
Bye-bye.

609
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,199
What's going on?

610
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,039
Didn't we agree
to go all the way with this act?

611
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,840
You were supposed to arrest me too.

612
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:42,880
How do you expect them to see me now?

613
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:48,159
You don't actually think

614
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:50,320
you can still be brothers
with them, do you?

615
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:55,880
We had a deal.

616
00:40:57,159 --> 00:40:58,400
Three doses of Achillense.

617
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,360
Enough to keep your girlfriend alive
for five more years.

618
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:02,360
Arrest me too.

619
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,480
Call them.

620
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,150
Tell them to arrest me right now, okay?

621
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:06,559
Tell them to take me in!

622
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:07,360
Arrest me!

623
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,239
Call them now!

624
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,760
Tell them to arrest me too!

625
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,480
Arrest me!

626
00:42:26,519 --> 00:42:27,480
(Ti Yi.)

627
00:42:28,199 --> 00:42:29,199
(My daughter.)

628
00:42:29,639 --> 00:42:31,800
