1
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,349
The customer is really annoying.

2
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:15,140
He kept touching me.

3
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,640
(2010, Meet Bar)
Because you're fair-skinned,

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,039
and your legs look great.

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,079
Who's driving?

6
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:20,760
Me.

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,719
Forget it. You're a bad driver.

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,719
No, I can't drive.

9
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:25,320
Let me drive.

10
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,160
- Hop on.
- Come on. Let's get in.

11
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,960
I told you I did drink that shot.

12
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,079
No, you didn't.

13
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:32,560
- You didn't.
- I saw it.

14
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,759
I did!

15
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,079
Let's go.

16
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:38,000
Ugh.

17
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,920
I should've made him
open a couple more wines.

18
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,030
Hang in there. We're almost home.

19
00:02:22,011 --> 00:02:31,750
=The Embers=

20
00:02:33,167 --> 00:02:35,210
=Episode 6=

21
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,150
This is already the third cup.

22
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,199
Very thirsty, huh?

23
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:55,840
Are you sure about this?

24
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,599
No, I'm not.

25
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,120
What I know is

26
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,940
that you saw him twice two nights ago.

27
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,140
Once at the early learning center,

28
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,680
you two went there for a session.

29
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:11,740
The second time, you bumped into him
at the entrance of the bridal shop.

30
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,400
That could be

31
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,599
an important alibi for him.

32
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,870
So you're not that confident?

33
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,000
Did you guys come for Liao Siyuan?

34
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,639
Well...

35
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:37,159
Me. It's me, actually.

36
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:38,319
I have proof.

37
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,919
I have an alibi for Liao Siyuan.

38
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:43,120
I have a video from that night.

39
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,280
We were rehearsing together.

40
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,280
I believe this video

41
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,879
conveys two pieces of information.

42
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:54,960
Body coordination

43
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,599
and sense of rhythm.

44
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:57,639
Look.

45
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,400
Look at how we move.

46
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:02,840
This is Liao Siyuan?

47
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,199
This is a good dancer.

48
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:10,560
It's me.

49
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,039
The clumsy one next to me is him.

50
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:15,599
Look.

51
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,040
He almost tripped.

52
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,959
Average. Very average.

53
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,360
Very average...

54
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:27,120
We had a performance
for the kids the next day.

55
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:28,720
We rehearsed until 11 PM.

56
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:31,560
Siyuan left at 8:30 PM.

57
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,279
He left at 8:30 PM?

58
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,800
Where did he go?

59
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:40,399
To commit murder?

60
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,720
We were doing this cute dance.

61
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,360
Our minds must've been purified.

62
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,120
How could he possibly kill someone?

63
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:49,240
Then how do you explain

64
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,340
his appearance
at the entrance of the bridal shop?

65
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,160
And why did he leave the center early?

66
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:55,399
You two met up afterward,

67
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:56,800
but why didn't he send you home?

68
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,950
How do you explain this?

69
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,720
How, Li Zhi?

70
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,399
A... A guy can go home by himself.

71
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,040
What...

72
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,800
Where's the evidence?

73
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:28,839
You guys don't have any evidence?

74
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,820
Are you two enjoying your Sunday
here at the police station?

75
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,200
My friend and I

76
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,980
had a social practice session
at an early learning center that night.

77
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,439
Something came up,

78
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,600
so I left early.

79
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:51,600
But after 11 PM, Nu Na...

80
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,879
Nu Na didn't die after 11:15 PM.

81
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,279
When I met Ma Luo,

82
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:01,480
it was before 10:54 PM.

83
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,920
She was already dead.

84
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,070
The person captured in the footage

85
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:08,319
isn't Nu Na.

86
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:13,079
Continue.

87
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,040
Hypothetically.

88
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:19,079
Let's say the person
in the footage is her.

89
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:21,079
Where was she killed?

90
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,759
When did the murderer

91
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:24,360
bring her body back to the bridal shop?

92
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,600
And at what time
did they leave the scene?

93
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,600
Why was the mannequin in the shop window

94
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:32,439
posed differently at 10:54 PM?

95
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:35,480
What if the person in the footage
isn't Nu Na

96
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,920
but the murderer who was about to escape
after killing?

97
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,920
Doesn't that make perfect sense?

98
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:45,399
But what we need is proof.

99
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,829
Can you prove

100
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,600
that the body was already
in the shop window

101
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,830
before 10:54 PM?

102
00:06:58,759 --> 00:06:59,519
I can't.

103
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,680
But I remember...

104
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,000
You're a suspect now.

105
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:05,319
Why should I trust what you remember?

106
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:12,160
Shu He, come out for a moment.

107
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,279
Xia.

108
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,930
This shop is known
for its beautiful window displays,

109
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:26,279
so people often take photos there.

110
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,399
I went through

111
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:28,879
all the recent pictures.

112
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,680
Scroll to the last picture.

113
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,600
This is taken

114
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,759
at 8:30 PM that night.

115
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,399
Look closely.

116
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,220
The mannequin's arm position
is different from that of the victim

117
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,320
in the murder scene.

118
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:46,279
So what he says is true.

119
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:51,000
All right.

120
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,120
Send me a copy of this.

121
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,600
Sign the papers and bring him home.

122
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,959
I have to work overtime.

123
00:07:58,639 --> 00:07:59,560
Hold him there.

124
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,839
Hold him there.

125
00:08:20,302 --> 00:08:24,480
(Healing hands as warm
as the spring breeze)

126
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,400
Are you feeding pigeons
or feeding mosquitoes?

127
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,560
None of your business.

128
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:32,639
Jin.

129
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,639
Mom.

130
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,440
You don't need...

131
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,080
Quiet.

132
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:40,759
Come here.

133
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:45,720
I was just...

134
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,360
Stand still.

135
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,759
Helping with the investigation.

136
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:48,320
I didn't...

137
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,680
First strike, to ward off calamity.

138
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,030
Second strike, to beat tribulation.

139
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,919
Third strike, to get rid of worries.

140
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,919
May the God of Happiness protect you!

141
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,919
Misfortunes, go away!

142
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,799
Are you all right, Siyuan?

143
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,150
Did they give you a hard time?

144
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:04,720
Come.

145
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,000
- They didn't.
- Let me check.

146
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,039
What's wrong with these people?

147
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,120
Why don't they go after real criminals?

148
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:12,080
How could they accuse you of murder?

149
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,000
I'll file a complaint tomorrow.

150
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,840
Enough. Let's go inside, Mom.

151
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,679
No.

152
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:17,639
Take off your coat.

153
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,750
You keep getting into the police station
these days.

154
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,360
Don't bring misfortune into the house.

155
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,320
Take off your coat.

156
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,200
When you go inside,

157
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:29,840
take a shower and shave your head,

158
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,799
all right?

159
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:34,360
You'll start fresh from today.
From head to toe.

160
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,149
Shave my head?

161
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:35,860
Of course.

162
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,720
It's not necessary.

163
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,040
- He'll do it.
- You must shave!

164
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,080
They are misfortunes.

165
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,799
You must shave!

166
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:41,159
All these cops

167
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,440
and cases

168
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,580
have nothing to do with you.

169
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,390
Stay out of it.

170
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,799
There's no need to shave my head.

171
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:47,200
Stop worrying about them, okay?

172
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,020
Stay out of things
that don't concern you.

173
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:52,740
(Healing hands as warm
as the spring breeze)

174
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:04,759
What's wrong, Siyuan?

175
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,639
Whenever I close my eyes,

176
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:18,000
I see the scene when Nu Na comes to me.

177
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,440
I just can't connect

178
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,200
the Nu Na in my memory

179
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,559
with the one I met that day.

180
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,150
What did she go through
over the past ten years

181
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:32,840
to change so much?

182
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:35,240
Some people change,

183
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,039
some don't.

184
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,320
Like me.

185
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,270
I haven't changed a bit
in the past decade.

186
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,600
No, you have.

187
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:48,679
No way.

188
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,320
You've become shameless.

189
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,679
She must've suffered a lot,

190
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,440
crawling out of the mire over the years

191
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,759
to get where she was.

192
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:14,519
Zhibai, I want to help her.

193
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,600
She did seem to be doing well.

194
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:24,600
Rich.

195
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:27,120
Successful in her career.

196
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,360
But it was obvious
her condition was terrible.

197
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,759
She was weak

198
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,320
and paranoid.

199
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:37,440
That's why

200
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:39,149
she was always suspicious,

201
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,640
thinking someone was following her.

202
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:47,879
That reminds me.

203
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,679
She told me someone was following her,

204
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,080
and I didn't think much about it
at the time.

205
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:54,679
Could that be why

206
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,320
she was killed,
just when she was about to tell me

207
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,500
the truth behind the fire?

208
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:00,480
Could the murderer

209
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,320
know something about the fire

210
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:04,879
or even be part of it?

211
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:08,840
Siyuan, about the person
who pretended to be Nu Na,

212
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,960
do you remember her shoes?

213
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,480
The heel doesn't fit well.

214
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,120
Her foot is bigger than Nu Na's.

215
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,399
No nail polish. Rough hands,

216
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,600
probably from a lot of washing.

217
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,279
Inside this bag

218
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,919
should be her own clothing and shoes.

219
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:26,559
Her ears are pierced,

220
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,400
but she hasn't worn earrings
in a long time,

221
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,390
so the holes have closed.

222
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,940
- Hair clip.
- Hair clip.

223
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,639
Are you sure Jing lives here?

224
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:49,639
The address her colleague gave
should be correct.

225
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:56,799
She's here.

226
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,480
Come over here.

227
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,910
I'll come fetch you tomorrow.

228
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,440
When can I move into your place?

229
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:13,840
This place is old and shabby.

230
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:15,919
Roaches run around at night.

231
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,799
I can't sleep.

232
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:20,919
This jerk

233
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,080
bought two identical hair clips.

234
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,360
One for his wife

235
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,440
and one for his mistress.

236
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:32,840
Right.

237
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,120
Also, Jing has pierced ears,

238
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:37,080
but the person we saw doesn't.

239
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,200
Their heights don't match,

240
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,260
and neither does the nail color.

241
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,279
Looks like this is a wasted trip.

242
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,660
Snap some pictures.

243
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,720
We know she's not the murderer.

244
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,860
What's the point of this?

245
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:58,879
Burden of proof trap.

246
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,399
Close-up. More.

247
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
The burden of proof trap

248
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,960
is when someone is labeled as guilty

249
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,159
without actual proof,

250
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,240
making them defend themselves.

251
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,480
They're in a sensitive position now.

252
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,720
If we accuse them of murder,

253
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,399
they'll have to tell the truth

254
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:28,480
to prove their innocence.

255
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,720
Name your price.

256
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:40,480
Five million.

257
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:45,519
Your wife was just murdered,

258
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,519
and you're messing up with her employee.

259
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:50,759
It's fine that I found out,

260
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,440
but if the media and police find out,

261
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,150
what do you think they'll say?

262
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,360
Don't slander me.

263
00:14:57,159 --> 00:14:58,440
This has nothing to do with me.

264
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,480
Nothing to do with you?

265
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,790
So, it has something to do with her?

266
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:04,159
Not at all.

267
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:05,159
Stop talking nonsense.

268
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,840
As far as I'm concerned,

269
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,639
the police found something.

270
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,799
The murderer was wearing
the same diamond clip

271
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,279
when they left the crime scene.

272
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,039
That means whoever has this diamond clip

273
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:18,240
is the murderer.

274
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,630
You said you didn't kill her,

275
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:23,360
so it was you.

276
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,240
No.

277
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,000
Not me.

278
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,120
I bought two identical clips.

279
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:32,000
The one Jing's wearing

280
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,720
has nothing to do with Nu Na.

281
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,480
You're the fine one to talk to.

282
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,960
This clip is such a jinx.

283
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,870
All right, calm down.

284
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:42,600
Look at them. They don't suspect
each other at all.

285
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,750
They're sure of themselves.

286
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:45,840
Unless they found

287
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,200
the body together that night.

288
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:52,200
You didn't kill her,

289
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,399
and you didn't either.

290
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,279
Then you did it together.

291
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,919
Both of you killed Nu Na.

292
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,200
No, that's not true.

293
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,200
I... I...

294
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,200
Fine, you won't tell?

295
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,000
Now you have a convincing motive

296
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:06,200
and conclusive evidence.

297
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,559
Tell the police yourself.

298
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:11,480
I'll tell you.

299
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,220
Jing.

300
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,080
I'll tell you!

301
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,440
Jing.

302
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,279
Why can't I tell him?

303
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:18,759
Do you want the police
to come to you again?

304
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,600
Think about it.

305
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:22,440
Which is worse, being caught cheating

306
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:24,159
or being suspected of murder?

307
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,300
I'll tell you everything.

308
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:33,200
We've been together for a long time.

309
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:36,440
Usually, I get off work at 8 PM,

310
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,279
but that night,

311
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,960
I returned to the shop later

312
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,080
because I was meeting him.

313
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,399
We found the body together.

314
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:48,200
I turned off the surveillance.

315
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:51,879
Well, it's safer in the dark.

316
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,000
Is the camera off?

317
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:56,919
It's off.

318
00:16:57,159 --> 00:16:58,519
You're smart.

319
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,039
Hold on.

320
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,079
I feel like someone's watching us.

321
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,880
No one's here. Shut up.

322
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:13,920
Wait.

323
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,640
I'll check.

324
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,759
Calm down.

325
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,480
Stop shouting. Calm down.

326
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,039
Someone's dead. Your wife is dead.

327
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:30,839
Calm down.

328
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:33,519
Call the police. Hurry.

329
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:34,759
No. Listen to me.

330
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:36,039
Listen first.

331
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:38,279
I'll leave first.

332
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:40,480
I can't stay here.

333
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,039
When the police come,

334
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:43,680
tell them you found her alone.

335
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:44,880
Got it?

336
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:46,759
Do not tell them I was here.

337
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:51,200
Remember.

338
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,720
But I didn't kill her.

339
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:02,960
If I had,

340
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,279
I wouldn't have lifted the veil.

341
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:08,680
You heard her.

342
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,200
We found the body together,

343
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,759
so we're clean.

344
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,359
Right?

345
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,039
The burden of proof trap.

346
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,599
Good hunting!

347
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:21,279
But I think they know more.

348
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,440
I think you know more.

349
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:33,839
No one's allowed in here,

350
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,279
so don't run your mouth outside.

351
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:40,759
Nu Na insisted on opening
this bridal shop.

352
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:43,720
She said it was a promise to a friend.

353
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,920
Nu Na wasn't even good at business.

354
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:50,519
But what could I do?

355
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:52,720
Women

356
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,510
need to be pampered.

357
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,960
How did you two meet?

358
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,030
Through drinking.

359
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,200
Back then, Nu Na

360
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:07,920
was an escort at a bar.

361
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:09,039
An escort?

362
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:11,240
You didn't know that?

363
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,160
Kind of funny, actually.

364
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,240
My ex-wife died

365
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,279
in a car accident.

366
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:19,400
The driver who hit her

367
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:21,279
was Nu Na's friend.

368
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,440
An escort as well.

369
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,000
After the accident,

370
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,039
that woman went to jail.

371
00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:31,200
What was her name?

372
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,030
It's been too long. I don't remember.

373
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:39,519
Seriously?

374
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:42,119
He can't even remember the name
of his wife's killer.

375
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,640
What a sweet couple.

376
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:50,039
But there's one weird thing.

377
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,759
There was a wedding gown
in my wife's car

378
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,920
when the accident happened.

379
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:57,880
She bought it

380
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,640
for our anniversary photoshoot.

381
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:02,279
The car caught fire,
and everything burned.

382
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:06,519
Did she actually come back for revenge?

383
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,880
Stop talking to him, please.

384
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,759
Let's go ask Jing.

385
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,839
She said she had something for me.

386
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:17,480
Do you know what it is?

387
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,839
She didn't mention anything.

388
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,270
Has anything gone missing
from the shop recently?

389
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:26,519
Well...

390
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:32,279
A few gowns are missing.

391
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,519
There's this celebrity named Man Ni.
Do you know her?

392
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:38,599
She's quite popular now.

393
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,759
She came by a while ago

394
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:42,880
and borrowed some gowns
for her performance.

395
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,240
She hasn't returned them yet.

396
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,200
This woman?

397
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,519
Yes, that's her.

398
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,240
She's prettier in person.

399
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,720
Let me see.

400
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:00,640
Oh, it's her. I saw her once.

401
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:02,480
She's just fine.

402
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,599
I remember something.

403
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,400
There was once
I came home drunk at night.

404
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:16,200
I overheard Nu Na
talking to her two friends.

405
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:22,519
If I had reported it to the police,

406
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:26,440
maybe his family could've been saved.

407
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,640
But I did nothing.

408
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,279
He was only ten.

409
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:35,240
For countless nights,

410
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:37,640
I see

411
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,279
his helpless and fragile face.

412
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:43,359
I was useless.

413
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,119
Mr. Cha Peng,

414
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,960
it's not very gentlemanly
to eavesdrop on girls' talk.

415
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,799
I'm so sorry.

416
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:03,960
Nu Na told Man Ni

417
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,799
about my story.

418
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,319
So she was talking about you?

419
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,400
Who was the other person there?

420
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:14,039
No idea. I didn't see it.

421
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,880
What Nu Na left me

422
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,000
is very important.

423
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,960
If you find it,

424
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,400
please let me know.

425
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:35,319
As long as you keep your mouth shut,

426
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,680
we're okay with any requests.

427
00:22:49,416 --> 00:22:54,090
(Jinhu Tower)

428
00:23:19,517 --> 00:23:23,000
(Man Ni)

429
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:32,279
How's it?

430
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,000
The time of death was around 12 AM.

431
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,590
The cause of death matches
the injury trait of a fall from height.

432
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,590
Her facial expression is very similar
to Nu Na's.

433
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,990
It's caused by the same drug, right?

434
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:42,000
Not sure.

435
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:44,240
I need an autopsy and toxicology tests

436
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,920
to confirm the precise cause of death.

437
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:47,640
If this is a serial murder case,

438
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,079
the situation will be different.

439
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,160
Could you please work overtime today?

440
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,200
I'm already working overtime.

441
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,480
Xia. Hey.

442
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:08,039
Liao Siyuan?

443
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,680
What are you doing here?

444
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,240
I went to the theater
to look for Man Ni.

445
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,400
The crew told me

446
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,340
that she didn't have
a performance today.

447
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,400
So the murderer

448
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,160
must be someone who knows where she is.

449
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,160
You're not the crew here.

450
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,000
Please leave.

451
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,680
The veil on the body

452
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:28,480
must be

453
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,359
an iconic replacement

454
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,519
as the murderer couldn't dress it
in a heavy gown

455
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,720
due to some limitations.

456
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:36,319
I think this murderer

457
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:38,279
is the same one who killed Nu Na.

458
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,000
How did you know
the body had a veil on it?

459
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:44,880
I...

460
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,440
I overheard some cops
talking at the police station.

461
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:50,920
They leaked case details.

462
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:53,000
They're going to lose their bonus.

463
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,240
As for you, go home right now.

464
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:00,319
I...

465
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,400
How's it going?

466
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:35,319
I contacted the chemicals agency.

467
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,780
I submitted the toxin identification
of Nu Na's sample

468
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,510
two weeks ago,

469
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:40,040
but the results aren't yet available.

470
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,519
This has never happened before.

471
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:44,240
Xia,

472
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,480
could it be a ghost?

473
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,070
There's no such thing as ghosts
in the world.

474
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:52,960
It's more likely to be an unknown toxin.

475
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:54,319
An unknown toxin?

476
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:57,240
If the victim dies
from an unknown toxin,

477
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,900
they need to transfer it to higher-ups
to compare with the central database.

478
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:03,000
It's normal if the report is delayed.

479
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,400
The victim is Man Ni.

480
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:18,119
26-year-old. An actress.

481
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:20,519
She was wearing a white veil
when she was found.

482
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:21,549
It's an obvious reference

483
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:23,500
to the bridal shop murder
that happened recently.

484
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,440
When we found her body,

485
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,559
all of her valuables were still on her,

486
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,119
and inside her bag,

487
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:30,640
there was a white paper bag.

488
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:32,119
It contained a large sum of cash,

489
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:33,720
so robbery isn't a possible motive.

490
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:39,640
We also looked
into her social relationships.

491
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,240
She rarely contacted her parents

492
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,240
and had no partner.

493
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,350
She was single,
had no romantic entanglements,

494
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:45,400
and had not many friends.

495
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,920
However, people around her

496
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,440
speak well of her,

497
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,400
so revenge murder is unlikely.

498
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,740
According to
the preliminary autopsy report,

499
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,750
the time of death was

500
00:26:54,759 --> 00:26:56,119
12 AM and 1 AM today.

501
00:26:56,599 --> 00:26:57,559
Like Nu Na,

502
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,759
she had that mysterious smile.

503
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,759
Anything else?

504
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:09,559
We believe the wedding gown
is a key clue.

505
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:12,359
When the first victim, Nu Na, was found,

506
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,820
she was wearing an intricate,
antique wedding gown.

507
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:17,060
Judging from Man Ni's death,

508
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,290
there was no need for her to be wearing
a wedding gown.

509
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,920
However, the murderer still
put a white veil on her.

510
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:25,030
The possibility of this being
a serial murder case is very high.

511
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,720
Have you looked into the relationship

512
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,880
between Man Ni and Nu Na?

513
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,360
They both worked as escorts
in the same bar eight years ago.

514
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,420
Man Ni's wedding gown was borrowed
from Nu Na.

515
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,359
Is there any other evidence

516
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:39,039
regarding this?

517
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:42,359
I handled a car accident
eight years ago.

518
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,240
There was a woman called Lan Xiaotang

519
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,680
who hit someone.

520
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:50,400
I remember

521
00:27:50,759 --> 00:27:53,319
there was a wedding gown
in the back seat of the deceased's car.

522
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:56,000
Both Man Ni and Nu Na
were in Lan Xiaotang's car.

523
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:59,519
Lan Xiaotang is the key person.

524
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:01,440
Find her as soon as possible

525
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,880
to investigate the relationship
between Man Ni and Nu Na.

526
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,920
We're already on it,

527
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,880
but she went missing
right after her release from prison.

528
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,200
We need some time.

529
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,560
As quickly as you could.

530
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,830
Deputy Chief Ni.

531
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,079
I need the footage.

532
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:36,559
Please. Help me.

533
00:28:43,771 --> 00:28:47,670
(Jinhu Tower)

534
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,440
I competed for a role with her?

535
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,680
Come on, it was the opposite.

536
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,940
I majored in performing arts.

537
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:52,750
Unlike her,

538
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,400
she did anything to get into
the show business.

539
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,440
She went all out, you know?

540
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,720
She even brought her own costumes

541
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,240
to compete for that role.

542
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:01,460
The security guards are here.

543
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,240
I think visitors aren't allowed in.

544
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,940
You're not a visitor.

545
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,940
Didn't you just have a fallout
with your family

546
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,580
and come here for apartment hunting?

547
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,039
Mr. Liao, here.

548
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:13,200
This way, please.

549
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:17,480
Look, the elevator here

550
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,039
is guarded by security.

551
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,760
Only that one is available
at the moment.

552
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,180
But don't worry, it won't take long.

553
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,200
To be honest,

554
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:26,920
the young woman who died last night
was pitiful.

555
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:28,640
She had just started to gain popularity.

556
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,279
I've been seeing her on TV recently.

557
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:34,119
Do you think she offended someone?

558
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:36,480
I heard she even brought a wedding gown

559
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,799
for the audition.

560
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,440
You see, Mr. Liao,

561
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:40,839
this young woman

562
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:42,920
was really hard-working.

563
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,200
She was also a people person.

564
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,830
I heard she was on bad terms

565
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:46,680
with her agency

566
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,560
because she wanted to
terminate her contract.

567
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:50,359
Her penalty

568
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,559
could buy an apartment here.

569
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:53,880
It's bizarre.

570
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:57,119
Not an accident?

571
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,160
Well, you see,

572
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,440
I'm a real estate agent,

573
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,860
and I shouldn't tell you this.
It could affect the price.

574
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,110
But this is different, you know?

575
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:06,759
The security guard on duty last night

576
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:08,860
took the police
to check the surveillance footage.

577
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,790
Guess what?

578
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:12,119
After watching it,

579
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:14,279
he was so panicked
that he nearly wet his pants.

580
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,480
He said

581
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,400
that when the young woman
was in the elevator,

582
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,480
she was...

583
00:30:18,888 --> 00:30:22,920
(May 30, 2019, Thursday)

584
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:57,039
She was completely beside herself.

585
00:30:57,839 --> 00:30:58,759
Just telling you this

586
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:00,279
gives me goosebumps.

587
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:01,640
Mr. Liao...

588
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:03,720
Where's he?

589
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,200
Mr. Liao?

590
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,079
Ni Ke sent over the footage.

591
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:39,000
The moment the scene shakes is

592
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:41,799
when the body is thrown onto
the elevator ceiling.

593
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,890
From the time
the victim left the elevator

594
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,140
to the completion of the crime,

595
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,380
the murderer took
five minutes and nine seconds.

596
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:50,039
But is it possible to commit murder,

597
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,519
bring the body from
the first to the tenth floor,

598
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,640
put a veil on it,

599
00:31:55,319 --> 00:31:57,519
and dump it

600
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,240
all within five minutes
and nine seconds?

601
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,599
The possibility is very low.

602
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,839
How about we look at this another way?

603
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:05,000
Now,

604
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,839
we can create a criminal profile

605
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,799
based on how the perpetrator
committed a murder.

606
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,519
Criminal profile?

607
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,319
Exactly.

608
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:12,759
By analyzing the crime process,

609
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:14,880
we can deduce the psychological traits

610
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,640
and describe other characteristics.

611
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,200
This is a common method

612
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,400
for identifying serial killers.

613
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:22,720
Siyuan,

614
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:25,359
between these two victims,
Nu Na and Man Ni,

615
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,790
what do they share in common?

616
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,110
The wedding gown.

617
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:32,720
They both worked as escorts

618
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,880
at the same place.

619
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:35,680
Precisely.

620
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,720
When they were killed,

621
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,279
no valuables were stolen,

622
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:42,680
and there were no signs
of sexual assault.

623
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:46,200
Instead, they were killed
by an unknown toxin.

624
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,559
The murderer chose wedding gowns

625
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:49,880
as the murder signature.

626
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:51,309
What kind of desire

627
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,780
is the murderer trying to satisfy?

628
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,279
A romance murder

629
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:55,720
or a revenge murder?

630
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:56,880
That's correct.

631
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,039
However, both can be
the same thing sometimes.

632
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,119
When both victims were killed,

633
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,580
they were dressed in wedding gowns,

634
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,180
and their faces were relatively intact.

635
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,440
This shows the murderer had

636
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,340
a strong imagination and anticipation
for them.

637
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,480
It's a man.

638
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,790
(Age between 18 to 40)
He knows both Nu Na and Man Ni.

639
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:14,680
(Nu Na and Man Ni worked at the bar)

640
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,900
(between 2008 to 2016)
His age

641
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,790
should be around 28 to 35.

642
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,880
The murderer killed them purely based

643
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,760
on his strong imagination
and anticipation.

644
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:24,160
This suggests severe personality flaws.

645
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:25,319
It's highly likely

646
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,920
that he came from an unhappy family,

647
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,440
was independent from a young age,
an introvert,

648
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,680
and, most importantly,

649
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,759
had serious emotional conflicts

650
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,640
with Nu Na and Man Ni.

651
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,119
And?

652
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,839
Let's look around

653
00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:43,319
for new clues.

654
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,920
This is the top floor.

655
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:50,960
No cameras here.

656
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,799
The dust is thick.

657
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,559
There are footprints.

658
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:03,400
They look like a size 36.

659
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,320
The height would be between
1.62 meters and 1...

660
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,719
No.

661
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,119
Did you make a mistake?

662
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:13,760
Impossible.

663
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:18,480
This height must be a woman.

664
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:21,159
But how could a woman

665
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:24,079
run up ten floors, commit murder,
and dump the body

666
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,640
in five minutes and nine seconds?

667
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:28,540
Even a grown man might not
have the physical strength to do that.

668
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,480
Unless the body moved by itself.

669
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,639
She first disrupted the elevator sensor

670
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,440
to keep the doors from closing,

671
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,480
then lured the victim

672
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,920
into the stairwell
where there were no cameras,

673
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,719
murdered her upstairs,

674
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
put a veil on her,

675
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,480
and finally dumped her
into the elevator shaft.

676
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,559
If that's the case,

677
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,000
it's possible for a woman

678
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:59,680
to complete the whole process
in five minutes and nine seconds.

679
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,199
No. The profile can't be wrong.

680
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:15,599
Everyone makes mistakes.

681
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:23,360
Siyuan.

682
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,000
What's wrong?

683
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,760
Check the lobby footage.

684
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,159
It looks familiar.

685
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:53,440
Looks like a blue and yellow vest.

686
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,480
It's Lemon Convenience Store's uniform.

687
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:05,190
I've verified with both the tower
and the convenience store.

688
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:06,280
There's only one person

689
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,960
who works at both places,

690
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:08,840
An Ni.

691
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,800
Excuse me, is An Ni here?

692
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:36,599
That's me.

693
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,000
Who are you?

694
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,000
I'm a student at Buhe University.

695
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,710
I'm volunteering for the community

696
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:45,480
to gather housing information.

697
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,880
May I come in for a quick chat?

698
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,039
Yes, please come in.

699
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:54,960
Have a seat. I'll get you
something to drink.

700
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,480
Zhibai, the blue and yellow vest.

701
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,480
Around 55 years old.

702
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:02,000
Convenience store staff
and tower janitor.

703
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,480
Monthly income is around 3,000 to 5,000.

704
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,480
Living conditions are average.

705
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,159
She buys lottery tickets regularly.

706
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,440
She lives with a man.

707
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,760
His job is unknown.

708
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,840
He's busy and rarely home.

709
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,360
Here.

710
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:23,480
Please have this.

711
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:24,280
Thank you.

712
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,679
What year are you in?

713
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,639
Final year.

714
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,480
Young people these days

715
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,800
even have to do volunteer work
in their final year.

716
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:36,480
It counts for credits.

717
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,960
This is the store's brand.

718
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:44,199
Madam, do you work
at a convenience store?

719
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,000
Yes.

720
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,119
Night shifts are not easy.

721
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:50,719
No.

722
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,360
At my age,

723
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,199
it's already blessed to have a job.

724
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:56,440
I mustn't be too picky.

725
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,480
How about your income?

726
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,159
6,000 puna.

727
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,400
Not much.

728
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,199
It's because of my old age.

729
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,199
Ask her who she lives with.

730
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,360
Do you live alone?

731
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,190
Do your children
have their own families?

732
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:18,719
I wish that were true.

733
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:20,320
I have a son.

734
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:21,440
He's busy.

735
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:24,119
He goes to work when I sleep,

736
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,360
and when he wakes up, I go to work.

737
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,920
We barely see each other.

738
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,920
We live under one roof,

739
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,400
but we're no different

740
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,639
from online friends.

741
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,599
What does he do for a living?

742
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,760
His job?

743
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,480
Yes.

744
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,639
Odd jobs.

745
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,119
He works here today

746
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,260
and somewhere else tomorrow.

747
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,840
Who knows where he really is?

748
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,760
Aren't you here for housing information?

749
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,599
It feels like a census instead.

750
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:09,239
We need a full understanding
of residents' lives

751
00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:12,400
and the relationship between
their income and living conditions.

752
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:17,920
Where do you work as a janitor, Madam?

753
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,480
Jinhu Tower.

754
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:23,800
Were you there two nights ago?

755
00:39:24,679 --> 00:39:25,679
Yes, I was.

756
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:34,800
Please have a look at this woman.

757
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:38,159
Did you see her that night?

758
00:39:44,463 --> 00:39:45,320
I did.

759
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,679
I've seen her around a lot.

760
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Rich, pretty,

761
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:52,880
and kind.

762
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:55,880
Please look closely.

763
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,599
Are you sure you saw her two nights ago?

764
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,000
It can't be wrong.

765
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,719
It was Tuesday.

766
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,920
She's off on Tuesdays.

767
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:06,780
I wouldn't get that wrong.

768
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:09,679
Siyuan,

769
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,440
based on the profile we came up with,

770
00:40:11,719 --> 00:40:13,199
An Ni doesn't fit as the murderer.

771
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,840
Besides, it seems like

772
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,679
she has nothing to do with the arson.

773
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,880
Ask her if she can show you around.

774
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:20,360
Let's check out her room.

775
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,360
Maybe we'll find something.

776
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:23,159
Madam,

777
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:25,480
may I look around your house?

778
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,679
I'd like to measure the space.

779
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,159
Sure. No problem.

780
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,740
Feel free to look around.

781
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,280
Nothing here.

782
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,239
Siyuan, check out the wardrobe.

783
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:55,199
Madam,

784
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,599
when was this wardrobe bought?

785
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,239
