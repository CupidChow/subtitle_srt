1
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:14,880
My brother's name is Liao Zhibai.

2
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,640
He's currently a student
at the police academy.

3
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,760
He's also the person I most admire

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,800
in this world.

5
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:22,800
He's smart, kind,

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,879
righteous, and brave.

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,280
Not only is he

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,640
a great fighter and detective,

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,519
but he's also good
at household chores and cooking.

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,600
Zhibai,

11
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,280
it smells great.

12
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:34,799
Can I eat it now?

13
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,000
Try it.

14
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:45,479
Is it good?

15
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,600
Yes.

16
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:51,439
This rabbit is delicious.

17
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,320
It was too skinny when it first arrived.

18
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,280
Thankfully, you kept it so plump.

19
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,840
If not, we wouldn't have enough
for two bites.

20
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:58,880
What...

21
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,600
What did you just say?

22
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:01,719
The rabbit.

23
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:10,040
Liao Zhibai, how dare you!

24
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:12,680
Wait.

25
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,000
Don't chase me.

26
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:15,760
This is a chicken.

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,239
I was just kidding.

28
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:18,840
Don't lie to me.

29
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:20,690
- Is that how you see me?
- Where's my rabbit?

30
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,200
He always taught me

31
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:25,799
that a man should have the courage
to conquer anything.

32
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:26,760
Siyuan,

33
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:28,120
go.

34
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,439
I gave you a Coke, so go now.

35
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:35,920
Come on.

36
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,560
Go on.

37
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,239
He also taught me

38
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,350
to be forgiving, cheerful,

39
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,920
and responsible for my own actions.

40
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:51,159
Look at you. You dropped it again.

41
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,920
What's wrong with you?

42
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,400
Rascal!

43
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:57,280
Was it you?

44
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:58,359
Not me.

45
00:01:58,439 --> 00:01:59,159
Not you?

46
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,799
No, Mom.

47
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:02,040
It was me.

48
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:06,120
Please punish me. I broke the vase.

49
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,960
It was you, little rascal!

50
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,680
Don't you run.

51
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:19,159
Watch your steps.

52
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,719
Though we fight

53
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:23,840
sometimes,

54
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,960
Zhibai will always be the best

55
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,199
in my heart.

56
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,759
I hope I can grow up quickly

57
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:32,879
and become an amazing adult like him.

58
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,520
So, what do you think of the essay?
Isn't it great?

59
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:10,450
=The Embers=

60
00:04:11,404 --> 00:04:14,230
=Episode 17=

61
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:17,560
Around 11:50 PM last night,

62
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:20,360
at the intersection
of Pingluo Expressway and Bucha Highway,

63
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,020
a serious highway explosion occurred.

64
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,480
It is said that scattered goods were

65
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,200
the mysterious narcotic AH7,
which was found a decade ago.

66
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,420
Whether the reappearance of AH7

67
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,749
in front of the public is related
to the arson from ten years ago,

68
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,290
we're waiting for the police's response.

69
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,160
Dr. Bian Ming,

70
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,759
you've assisted us

71
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:40,639
in similar cases before.

72
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:42,920
I'd like to hear your opinion

73
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,279
on Liao Siyuan.

74
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,160
Well,

75
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,120
based on the available records,

76
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,360
on the day of the explosion,

77
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:58,680
Liao Siyuan was indeed

78
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,950
in a state of psychotic distress.

79
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,320
He lost his ability to control himself
and recognize.

80
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,040
Normally, patients can be exempt

81
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,040
from legal responsibility
under traffic laws.

82
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:08,240
Their family members and guardians

83
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,439
will handle the subsequent
civil compensation.

84
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,959
However, his condition is serious.

85
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:15,879
He injured someone.

86
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,319
One of his classmates and I

87
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:20,000
were injured.

88
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,320
I won't pursue legal action against him.

89
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,360
As for the other victim,

90
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:26,800
we've reached a settlement.

91
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,720
As his guardian,

92
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,920
I'll oversee Siyuan's treatment

93
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:33,199
in the following days.

94
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,959
Please be assured, sir.

95
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,000
All right.

96
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,720
Pay the fine and sign the paperwork.

97
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,759
Mr. Bian Ming, thank you so much.

98
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:48,560
It's my duty.

99
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,800
Shu He, you stay.

100
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,800
The others are dismissed.

101
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,079
Many parties are involved
in this explosion.

102
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,780
It has had tremendous influence.

103
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,439
Aside from the drug case in Buhe City,

104
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,480
several previous cases

105
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,160
have also resurfaced.

106
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,360
They are all connected

107
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,280
to the arson in Yong'an Village
ten years ago.

108
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:27,399
Liao Siyuan is a key figure.

109
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:29,439
He should be recused.

110
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:31,879
Keep a close watch on him.

111
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,160
Yes, sir.

112
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,199
However, the top priority right now is

113
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,560
that the first public exposure
of substantial AH7

114
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,480
has sparked discussion.

115
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,390
The online discussion has run amok.

116
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,600
The higher-ups are
very concerned about this case.

117
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:54,319
We need to provide an answer
to the public as soon as possible.

118
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,519
What's the progress?

119
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,400
We've searched through
all the commercial premises in the city,

120
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,780
but nothing has been found.

121
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,800
The drug gift box is believed
to be offered only to fixed customers.

122
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,000
Judging by the crime scene,

123
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,640
this is a large-scale production

124
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,960
meant for long-term distribution.

125
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,480
We suspect

126
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,040
the mastermind behind Liu Haixun

127
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,950
showed up at the scene that day.

128
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,959
We're verifying their identity.

129
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,519
Shu He.

130
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,279
This case is complicated.

131
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,920
Issue a wanted notice immediately

132
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,460
and track down the mastermind.

133
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,439
All right, you may go.

134
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,000
That's too small.

135
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,319
Officer Wang,

136
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,759
the fine is too small.

137
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:06,519
He's caused a huge trouble.

138
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,720
He needs to be punished severely.

139
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,920
If not, he wouldn't learn
from the lesson.

140
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,199
The fine is a lot.

141
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:14,279
It's not enough.

142
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,399
Fortunately, no one died this time.

143
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,800
Otherwise,

144
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,040
no amount of money could fix it.

145
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:25,319
Please count it.

146
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:26,240
Yes, you're right.

147
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:30,680
It's too much.

148
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:35,960
Officer,

149
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,679
could you let me

150
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,159
check on my son?

151
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,320
There are rules.

152
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,799
It's not up to us.

153
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,159
Sign here.

154
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,799
Officer,

155
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,960
when will my son be released?

156
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,919
I've been waiting all night.

157
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:00,799
Mom.

158
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,279
Go home.

159
00:10:03,371 --> 00:10:09,200
(Qi's Pharmacy, Healing hands
as warm as the spring breeze)

160
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,039
Come here.

161
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:17,480
Stand still.

162
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:19,799
Mom, not this again.

163
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,720
I spent one night inside.
It's not necessary...

164
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,279
Step back.

165
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:29,480
Again.

166
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,360
First strike, to ward off calamity.

167
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,540
Second strike, to beat tribulation.

168
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:37,200
Third strike, to get rid of worries.

169
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,279
Take off your jacket.

170
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,120
Jin.

171
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,919
Walk over it.

172
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,559
Do I really have to?

173
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:19,519
Walk through the flames.
Fire severs all bonds.

174
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,840
All spirits or demons

175
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,720
shall vanish

176
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:26,399
and haunt you no more.

177
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:28,480
Walk through it.

178
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:31,759
Do it.

179
00:11:35,535 --> 00:11:36,399
Come on.

180
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,740
Do you refuse to let go
of the ghost pestering you,

181
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:44,039
or is he holding you back?

182
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,039
You're already dead.

183
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,799
Why won't you leave him alone?

184
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:55,799
Why won't you leave

185
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:56,679
our family alone?

186
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:58,679
You're disturbing us.

187
00:11:58,799 --> 00:11:59,799
Go away!

188
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:02,080
Just leave already!

189
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:05,120
You claim to protect him,

190
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,879
but what have you done?

191
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,519
What have you really done?

192
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:10,600
Hadn't you come back,

193
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:12,759
he wouldn't have been hurt.

194
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:14,320
Don't you care about him?

195
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,559
He's lost a lot of blood.

196
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,320
There are so many times
Siyuan almost...

197
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:23,200
He almost died.

198
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:25,480
He was so close to death.

199
00:13:07,064 --> 00:13:07,980
(Qi's Pharmacy)

200
00:13:08,066 --> 00:13:09,530
(May 29, 2009)

201
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,279
Siyuan,

202
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,919
run.

203
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,799
- Siyuan.
- Run!

204
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:57,679
Siyuan,

205
00:13:58,639 --> 00:13:59,639
did you see that?

206
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,360
It's always you.

207
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,679
I exist

208
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:06,600
because

209
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:09,480
I am you.

210
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,120
You saw everything that day.

211
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,679
But you were too afraid,

212
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:20,120
so you created me

213
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,480
and forgot everything.

214
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:25,240
The drawer in your memory palace
that you can never open

215
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:28,600
is not where the truth lies.

216
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:32,960
Instead, it holds the runaway boy

217
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,600
who couldn't face reality.

218
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,279
I didn't mean to run away.

219
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,159
I know.

220
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,399
You were only ten.

221
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,679
You couldn't do anything.

222
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:53,200
That's why I wanted you to run.

223
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:54,720
Run away from the fire.

224
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:59,360
At least you had the courage
to run away from all of this.

225
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,279
If you hadn't,

226
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,440
you would've vanished in this fire

227
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:09,039
like me, Dad, and Mom.

228
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:12,840
I should've been with you all.

229
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:18,320
I was such a coward.

230
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:22,919
Even last night,

231
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,279
if I hadn't insisted on chasing
that person,

232
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,519
Xia wouldn't have been hurt.

233
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:36,840
I even blamed it on you.

234
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,559
Shu He was right.

235
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:45,120
What I've been avoiding all along

236
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,639
is my cowardice

237
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,720
and insignificance.

238
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:57,279
But every second, every minute
over the past ten years,

239
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:00,320
you've been preparing yourself.

240
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,519
Siyuan,

241
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,200
you've worked very hard.

242
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,080
No one masters

243
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,440
basic deduction in a day.

244
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,200
No one picks up

245
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,799
criminal profiling overnight.

246
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,120
Through so many cases,

247
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:24,159
you turned self-blame into courage

248
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:27,080
and guilt into persistence.

249
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:30,519
You've become an amazing adult.

250
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,120
So

251
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,240
you don't need my protection anymore.

252
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:49,960
Can I?

253
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,279
Face it or run from it,

254
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,919
it's your choice.

255
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,360
There's no right or wrong.

256
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,360
If the present you

257
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,480
still choose to leave,

258
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,680
that's okay.

259
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:13,000
Let's pretend nothing has happened.

260
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,000
You'll still be you,

261
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,160
and I'll still be me.

262
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,480
I'll always be with you.

263
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:32,039
But Siyuan, it's been ten years.

264
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,640
Are you sure you want
to make the same choice again?

this late at night?

00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,940
I can take you out to sing,
dance, and drink. Is that okay?

294
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,240
Sorry, I forgot

295
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:13,039
you're still injured.

296
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,799
Mom,

297
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:19,960
recently,

298
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,519
I don't know how to face Siyuan.

299
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,380
You feel the same way, don't you?

300
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:32,440
Are you blaming me?

301
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,000
They have to separate anyway.

302
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:44,640
I've been thinking a lot

303
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:46,440
about my past with Zhibai.

304
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,960
I used to believe

305
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,920
that the longer we were apart,

306
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,600
the more our memories would fade.

307
00:20:57,519 --> 00:20:59,119
But somehow,

308
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,119
they're becoming clearer.

309
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:16,599
I realized

310
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,349
that the hardest part

311
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,960
isn't when two people are separated.

312
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:25,559
It's when the memories

313
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,720
keep coming back.

314
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,839
It could be

315
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,720
a street we once walked together

316
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:46,359
or the unique scent of him.

317
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,680
They become more and more...

318
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,920
Inescapable.

319
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:57,960
Finally,

320
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,079
they turn into a deadly weapon.

321
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,440
I have so many things
I want to tell him.

322
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:18,720
But it's okay.

323
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,960
We'll meet again.

324
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,000
Maybe

325
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,640
in another world.

326
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:37,640
I want to share every single bit

327
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,680
that happened

328
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:48,359
over the past year.

329
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,519
Move.

330
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:01,960
Stop.

331
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:03,000
Turn right.

332
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,720
Hold on tight.

333
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,079
Move.

334
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:26,640
What's on your mind?

335
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:33,319
How do you feel now?

336
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:39,640
To be honest, I must thank you.

337
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:44,759
If you put it that way,

338
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:46,359
I should apologize.

339
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,039
I was biased against you.

340
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:51,200
But after going through
so much together,

341
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,400
I've realized
you have this energy in you.

342
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,359
Do you remember this?

343
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,840
Every time I see these teeth marks,

344
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:11,880
they remind me of you as a kid.

345
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,559
I used to wonder
what would happen to you

346
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:17,759
after going through all that

347
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,079
at such a young age.

348
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,880
Would your life be ruined?

349
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,740
Was there anything I could do for you?

350
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:28,000
But in the end, you became a great man.

351
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,599
You saved yourself.

352
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:35,279
Not yet.

353
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,599
Not until I find the truth.

354
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,880
That's the only way
I can truly save myself.

355
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,359
I won't give up.

356
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,599
I'll keep searching

357
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,039
in my own way.

358
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:05,720
To be frank, this case is complicated.

359
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,960
The deeper I dig,

360
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,000
the more new problems I uncover.

361
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,400
I'm short of manpower.

362
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,839
You need my help?

363
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,270
Didn't your director want me
to recuse myself?

364
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:23,559
Yes.

365
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,160
Which is why I've been persuading him.

366
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:27,599
I told him

367
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,900
that even if we stopped you
from investigating,

368
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:31,640
you wouldn't give up so easily.

369
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,520
Instead of wasting our energy
to stop you,

370
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,160
it's better for us to work together.

371
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:38,599
What's his response?

372
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,839
He thought it made sense.

373
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:48,160
That's good, though.

374
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,590
Everything that happened that night
was unexpected.

375
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:54,799
Looking back over the past few days,

376
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,100
I've noticed a lot of things
that don't add up.

377
00:26:58,839 --> 00:26:59,640
Why did the car

378
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:01,880
suddenly explode?

379
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:03,319
Why did the truck

380
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:05,079
force the car behind it to stop?

381
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,720
Who was inside?

382
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,030
And who's the fourth person
in that photo...

383
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:12,079
I'll tell you that.

384
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,519
But you see,

385
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,359
I vouched for you this time,

386
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,960
so you have to follow my orders.

387
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,360
I'll have to take responsibility
if anything goes wrong.

388
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:22,839
All right.

389
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,200
Hello?

390
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,720
Got it.

391
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:37,839
We arrested one of Liu Haixun's men,

392
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,759
Meng Kun.

393
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,790
He was severely injured a few days ago

394
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,340
and has been in a coma at the hospital.

395
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,220
He's awake now.

396
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,680
Let's go check on him.

397
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:47,920
Let's go.

398
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:05,000
Bai Han and Mr. Xun
had a deal that day,

399
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,560
but Xun requested that Bai Han

400
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:09,920
bring everyone over.

401
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,559
Bai Han agreed.

402
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:17,440
Later, however, he worried

403
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,240
that if we broke our word

404
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,319
and turned on them,

405
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:26,640
he and his goods wouldn't be able
to leave the dried fruit factory.

406
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,960
So, he came up with a plan.

407
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,340
That's to set up separate locations
for the deal.

408
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,039
When the dealer arrives,
and the goods will be sent out.

409
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,839
Then examine the goods and pay up.

410
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:01,920
What does this mean?

411
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:03,480
It's our rule.

412
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:05,920
We'll pat you down.

413
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,720
Is this how you treat your guests?

414
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:11,319
Bai Han,

415
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,480
since you're here,

416
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,840
let's show some respect for each other.

417
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:19,799
Fine.

418
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:21,640
I'll do you this favor.

419
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:25,680
Come on.

420
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,519
You're not very professional.

421
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,359
You should improve yourself.

422
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,079
I'm here.

423
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,200
Can you deliver the goods now?

424
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:23,319
Address.

425
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:32,110
The intersection of Pingluo Expressway
and Bucha Highway.

426
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:34,720
My men are waiting there.

427
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,030
Xun is waiting for you inside there.

428
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,400
Where's Liu Haixun?

429
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,839
I'm here.

430
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:26,319
Bai Han, I was worried you'd
point your pun at me again,

431
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,519
so I thought a little distance
would be best.

432
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:33,640
Bai Han,

433
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:35,640
there's something I've always been

434
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,319
curious about.

435
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,759
Why do you keep going after Song En?

436
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,240
None of your business.

437
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,480
Come on, tell me.

438
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,160
I've already delivered your goods.

439
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:46,160
We'll be friends from now on.

440
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:47,559
You don't even dare to show up.

441
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:49,480
We're not friends.

442
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:51,640
Don't flatter yourself.

443
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:08,359
Surprise.

444
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:09,680
Surprise.

445
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,200
Bai Han,

446
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:12,240
I'm sorry.

447
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,960
We don't have a grudge.

448
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:16,119
Tie Xin put me up to this.

449
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,720
If you turn into a vengeful ghost,

450
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,920
please don't come after me.

451
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:19,960
Go after him.

452
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:20,920
Didn't you say

453
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,440
you didn't want to be
Tie Xin's lackey anymore?

454
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,480
Being a lackey isn't so bad.

455
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:30,720
Sometimes, you get beaten and scolded,

456
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,960
but you never go hungry.

457
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:35,079
Bai Han,

458
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,400
you didn't answer my question,

459
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:40,240
but I can offer you a secret.

460
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,720
I was part

461
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,640
of that fire as well.

462
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,000
In fact,

463
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,079
I should be on your hit list.

464
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,240
Liu Haixun,

465
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,240
you deserve to die.

466
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,720
Sadly, you don't get to decide that.

467
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:00,359
Bai Han,

468
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:01,839
do you know why

469
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:03,720
I targeted you guys back then?

470
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:05,920
It wasn't just about pleasing Gai De.

471
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:07,279
You young ones

472
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,240
were too naive and brazen

473
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:12,039
to pursue the so-called justice.

474
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,759
I wanted to teach you a lesson

475
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,319
and show you what darkness really is.

476
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,119
Stop wasting your effort.

477
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,519
The entire space is bulletproof.

478
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,279
You can't get out.

479
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:27,680
Liu Haixun,

480
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:30,599
you'll go to hell.

481
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:33,119
I'm not going to hell.

482
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,900
I'll give that chance to whoever wants it.

483
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,279
Take this. You do it.

484
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,640
It's not good to kill.

485
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:41,799
Take it.

486
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,440
Press the button.

487
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:13,260
Are you saying that the explosion
at the dried fruit factory

488
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,440
was planned by Liu Haixun
to kill Bai Han?

489
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:16,639
Is Bai Han dead?

490
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,280
The factory didn't explode.

491
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,960
We didn't find Bai Han's body
in the factory.

492
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,239
They never even entered.

493
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:24,519
Right?

494
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:28,360
Yes.

495
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,800
The two newcomers

496
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,000
were Bai Han's spies.

497
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,639
Help me.

498
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:41,960
Help me.

499
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,039
They set up a room

500
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,400
inside a refrigerated truck

501
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:10,039
that looked exactly

502
00:35:10,039 --> 00:35:11,280
like Xun's office.

503
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:15,440
Then, they planted someone there

504
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,559
to move the camera

505
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,679
to the refrigerated truck.

506
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,480
After I left that day,

507
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:28,519
they knocked everyone else out.

508
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,800
Then, they got into
the refrigerated truck they prepared

509
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:47,880
and followed behind us.

510
00:35:48,039 --> 00:35:48,840
Hold on.

511
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,280
You mentioned

512
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,159
the person who ordered Liu Haixun
to kill Bai Han was Tie Xin?

513
00:35:56,039 --> 00:35:56,760
Right.

514
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:57,960
Who is this person?

515
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,800
I don't know.

516
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:05,480
All I know is he's a big shot.

517
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:07,679
Even Xun listens to him.

518
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,440
Who was the other guy

519
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,719
with Bai Han?

520
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,519
He was about my height.

521
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,639
Double eyelids.

522
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:22,400
High nose bridge.

523
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,800
He had...

524
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,679
a Cantonese accent. Right.

525
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:30,559
A Cantonese accent.

526
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,709
Chief,

527
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:34,960
this is the surveillance footage
from the crime scene.

528
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,679
He was outfoxed.

529
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,039
He never expected

530
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:07,760
to fall into the very scheme he designed.

531
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:13,039
What's on your mind?

532
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,679
I'm thinking about

533
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,960
the people in the footage.

534
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:22,880
The fat guy is Gan,

535
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,900
and the skinny one is Tai.

536
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,100
Both of them worked under Bai Han.

537
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:29,239
Who's the other one?

538
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:34,360
He's wearing a hat the whole time.
I couldn't see his face.

539
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,880
He's with Bai Han, for sure.

540
00:37:36,039 --> 00:37:37,679
We'll get him when we catch Bai Han.

541
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,639
Why?

542
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,440
Who do you think he is?

543
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,199
No idea.

545
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:12,840
Have you found anything?

546
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:18,360
I need surveillance data for
the whole city for the past seven days.

547
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,960
As many as you can get.

548
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:22,519
The whole city?

549
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,519
Are you trying to find one person

550
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,960
among 700,000 people?

551
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:27,760
Yes.

552
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,239
All right.
