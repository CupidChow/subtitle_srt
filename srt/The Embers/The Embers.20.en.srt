1
00:00:12,491 --> 00:00:14,030
(Year 2009)

2
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:14,720
Excuse me.

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:15,679
Excuse me.

4
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,260
(Year 2009)

5
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:23,079
Sir,

6
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:24,960
what happened?

7
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,040
What happened to Lang Sang?

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,320
Lang Sang sustained severe head trauma.

9
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:31,640
The preliminary cause of death
is a skull fracture.

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,000
The murder weapon was a hammer.

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,640
Chief Lei,
here's the list of the victims.

12
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:41,280
In addition,

13
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,799
there's a bruise on his wrist

14
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,759
that matches the handprint pattern

15
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:47,719
of another victim, Ti Yi.

16
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:49,719
Ti Yi, female,

17
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,479
22 years old,

18
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,439
and a vocal major
at the Academy of Arts.

19
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:55,079
Her body shows
more than ten surface bruises,

20
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,470
indicating she suffered
a violent beating before death.

21
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,620
There are clear strangulation
marks around her neck.

22
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:00,780
She suffered vaginal tearing.

23
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:01,840
Traces of semen were found.

24
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:03,840
The murder weapon was a fruit knife.

25
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,840
We also found syringes at the scene,

26
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,959
suggesting that both victims
may have used drugs.

27
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,719
We'll take the bodies back

28
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:13,599
for further autopsy and examination.

29
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,200
Sir,

30
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:20,040
I just called Lang Sang earlier.

31
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,079
Where is his phone?

32
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:21,879
Li.

33
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:25,079
We found extensive records of him

34
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:27,480
browsing adult websites on his phone.

35
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:29,640
We also found a matching

36
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,799
login account on Ti Yi's phone.

37
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,879
They had been communicating online,

38
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,510
and messages were explicit.

39
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:32,599
Hey.

40
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,319
You're late.

41
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,960
I remember you said
you liked black stockings.

42
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,260
I went out of my way
to buy some just for you.

43
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:02,360
You're so naughty.

44
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,120
I got something special for you too.

45
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,759
You're pretty careful, huh?

46
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,599
Even thought to prepare cash.

47
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,599
Wait...

48
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,039
This isn't the price we agreed on.

49
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,560
You were 40 minutes late.

50
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,300
What's wrong with me deducting a little?

51
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,240
I even gave you an extra round just now.

52
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:48,960
Did I ask you to?

53
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,780
Ugh, I'm never taking business
from these country folks again.

54
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,240
What did you say?

55
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:07,919
Nothing, sir.

56
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:08,520
Open the door.

57
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,080
No, I really didn't hear

58
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,840
what you said.

59
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:15,439
Come on, don't be so sensitive.

60
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,519
Some country folks

61
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,000
are just impossible to deal with.

62
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,639
Now, can you open the door?

63
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,360
I have another client waiting.

64
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:23,879
Fine.

65
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,759
Who are you calling a country folk?

66
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,640
I know people look down on me,

67
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,839
but you too?

68
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,600
This is for looking down on me!

69
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,190
This is for looking down on me!

70
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,510
This is for looking down on me!

71
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:20,519
We've collected
fingerprints from the hammer

72
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,420
and the fruit knife handle.

73
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,100
The comparison process is underway.

74
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,880
We'll have the results soon.

75
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,639
This doesn't add up.

76
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,680
How is the evidence
this perfectly laid out?

77
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,380
And the difference in their
physical strength is too significant.

78
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,740
Even if it was a mutual killing,

79
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:39,160
there's no way it would've
ended with both of them dead.

80
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:42,360
There had to be
a third person at the scene.

81
00:07:05,709 --> 00:07:13,830
=The Embers=

82
00:07:15,022 --> 00:07:17,320
=Episode 20=

83
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,519
Officer,

84
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,519
you must have the wrong guy.

85
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,639
I swear, I don't know anything.

86
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:38,600
Speak when you're asked to.

87
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,759
Name, age, and occupation.

88
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:51,879
I'm Gai De, 32 years old.

89
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,360
I run an art training business.

90
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:58,319
I founded Zhenmei in 2014.

91
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,720
What's your relationship
with the victim?

92
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,759
I... I really don't know her.

93
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,070
Chief Shu, this is Ti Yi's statement.

94
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,440
The forensic team is in a hurry.

95
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,600
They need your signature.

96
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:23,720
Officer,

97
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,720
has Ti Yi used that pen before?

98
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,840
Could I take a sniff?

99
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,639
Maybe I can provide

100
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,399
some useful information for the case.

101
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:13,279
Here.

102
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,720
I'm certain I've never
met this person before.

103
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,480
This might sound a little complicated,

104
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:41,080
but to put it simply,

105
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,480
every person has a unique scent.

106
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:46,600
It's something I use

107
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,630
as an important screening factor
during interviews.

108
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:50,080
Normally, I select people who exude

109
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:53,679
the scent of positivity,
diligence, sincerity, and kindness.

110
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,080
But this person

111
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,720
doesn't have that scent.

112
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,279
So, I'm positive

113
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,080
that I've never met her.

114
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,080
Between 10 PM and midnight last night,

115
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,039
where were you?

116
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,399
During dinner,

117
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,919
I had a few drinks by myself.

118
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:26,960
I kept drinking until around midnight,

119
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,580
right until you guys
barged in and arrested me.

120
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,039
Officer,

121
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,519
please believe me.

122
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,960
I was at home that entire night.

123
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:45,360
I've never even seen that person before.

124
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:07,279
Chief, he...

125
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,279
He's lying.

126
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,600
That night, I did work overtime

127
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:18,159
and left pretty late.

128
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,399
Did you hear or see anything unusual?

129
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,960
As I was leaving,

130
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,960
I happened to run into Mr. Gai De.

131
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:28,159
I said hello to him,

132
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,360
and I saw him

133
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,360
heading toward Ti Yi's office.

134
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,509
Mr. Gai De,

135
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,360
you're coming back to work at this hour?

136
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,480
When did Ti Yi start working here?

137
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,279
About six months ago.

138
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,799
We even had a team-building
event last week.

139
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:58,240
Here's a photo of us.

140
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,720
Chief,

141
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:12,840
doesn't the name Ti Yi sound familiar?

142
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,880
I feel like I've heard it
somewhere before.

143
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:21,240
Shu He, come out for a minute.

144
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:29,960
Two reports.

145
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,200
One is Ti Yi's.

146
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,360
Her blood test shows
no traces of alcohol,

147
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,240
which means she was fully
conscious when she was assaulted.

148
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,940
There are bruises on her wrist.

149
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,480
On the right side of her lower body,
there's visible tearing,

150
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,720
along with traces of semen.

151
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:43,639
Tissue samples were
found under her nails,

152
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:45,240
and DNA testing

153
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,879
confirms a match with the suspect.

154
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:48,480
And this.

155
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:50,080
This is Gai De's report.

156
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:51,840
His blood alcohol level

157
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,279
was around 75 mg.

158
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,900
There's a scratch on his forearm.

159
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,640
This suggests that
at the time of the crime,

160
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,520
he was intoxicated,

161
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,300
consistent with the witness's statement.

162
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:01,679
Based on the evidence,

163
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,020
we can officially open a case.

164
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,720
Sexual assault cases
are never complicated,

165
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,760
but they're hard to prove.

166
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,150
Luckily, this victim was clear-headed

167
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:08,919
and decisive.

168
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,960
But Shu He,

169
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,320
don't you think

170
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:15,600
this evidence is too perfect?

171
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,720
She's out.

172
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,039
What's your relationship

173
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:30,039
with Gai De?

174
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:31,519
Please tell us something.

175
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:33,519
Tell us about you and Gai De.

176
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:34,279
Please make way.

177
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:35,000
Say something.

178
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:35,919
Wait.

179
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,080
I'm willing to do the interview.

180
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,799
Let me introduce myself.

181
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,960
My name is Ti Yi.

182
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:00,279
I'm not the only victim.

183
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:02,960
For years,

184
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,480
Gai De used job interviews as a front,

185
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:08,000
when in reality, he was selecting
women for himself.

186
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,919
Too many girls

187
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:14,399
fell for his wealthy
and sophisticated appearance,

188
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:17,840
only to be slowly trapped.

189
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,720
Harassed, assaulted, and in some cases,

190
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,639
left bruised and battered.

191
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,840
And then, he used
their reputations against them...

192
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,159
It's only been an afternoon,

193
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,980
and public opinion online

194
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,440
has already convicted Gai De
before the trial even starts.

195
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,879
Zhenmei just posted a statement.

196
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:39,200
They're suspending operations

197
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,120
and offering full refunds
to all students.

198
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,120
This woman is tough.

199
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:45,440
Doesn't seem like an ordinary victim.

200
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,759
Who says

201
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:49,840
victims have to be timid and afraid?

202
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:53,039
If the assault really happened,

203
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,080
she had the right to seek justice.

204
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:57,480
Sure, her methods are extreme,

205
00:14:57,919 --> 00:14:59,879
but that's her way
of fighting for justice.

206
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,039
I don't see anything wrong with that.

207
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,600
Siyuan.

208
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,280
What are you thinking about?

209
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:17,840
I'm thinking

210
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:21,600
Gai De was drinking
with me that night...

211
00:15:23,928 --> 00:15:25,310
(Zhibai)

212
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:27,679
What you're saying is,

213
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,399
Gai De was with you
at the time of the crime?

214
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,320
He was never at Zhenmei?

215
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:33,240
Yes.

216
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:35,679
How could one person

217
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,279
be in two places at once?

218
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:38,960
He didn't rape Ti Yi.

219
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:42,159
So, are you going to testify for him?

220
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:48,879
Now that I know the truth,

221
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,480
I can't just pretend I don't.

222
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,460
An innocent person shouldn't
be falsely accused.

223
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,279
Siyuan,

224
00:15:58,159 --> 00:15:59,600
what's more important,

225
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,840
the truth or punishing the guilty?

226
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,519
Just because Gai De knows Tie Xin

227
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,600
doesn't mean he's a bad person.

228
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,960
You've got a point.

229
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,399
Do what you believe is right.

230
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:40,320
How are you doing?

231
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,240
I'm fine.

232
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,240
I'm doing well.

233
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,679
You have an alibi.

234
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,670
Why didn't you tell them?

235
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,080
What are you talking about?

236
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,559
What alibi?

237
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,519
But I saw you.

238
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,000
Liao Siyuan, stop making things up.

239
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:13,319
That night, I was drinking alone at home.

240
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,440
Then I called you. That's it.

241
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,839
Chief,

242
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,960
you're letting
them meet just like that?

243
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,270
This doesn't seem appropriate.

244
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,319
During an active investigation,

245
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,319
to get as much information as possible,

246
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,640
extraordinary circumstances
call for extraordinary measures.

247
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,920
You're a veteran officer.

248
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,240
Right.

249
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,580
Extraordinary circumstances,
extraordinary measures.

250
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:42,880
By the way,

251
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:44,400
did the records department

252
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,200
get back to us
with Ti Yi's full details?

253
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,550
I'll go check right now.

254
00:17:56,519 --> 00:17:58,200
So you're saying you were framed?

255
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,599
Yes.

256
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,680
I can feel it. Someone set me up.

257
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:08,000
I've become someone else's prey.

258
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,140
I don't want to drag you into this.

259
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,000
Why?

260
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:21,920
Because...

261
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,759
We're friends.

262
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,960
I don't know

263
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,920
what path you took to get here,

264
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:34,079
and I don't know

265
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,160
where we'll part ways,

266
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,680
but for this short journey
that we've crossed paths,

267
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:43,839
I want to do something for you.

268
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:46,519
Once I get out,

269
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,160
I'll help you find
the person you're looking for.

270
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:55,279
But the evidence against you is solid.

271
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,300
How are you going to get out?

272
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,920
Justice may be delayed,

273
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,720
but it will never be denied.

274
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,079
What's going on?

275
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,279
At that time, I was with him.

276
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:38,359
You're sure?

277
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,359
Yes.

278
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,680
So this means

279
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,079
the same person appeared
in two different places

280
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:46,680
at the same time,

281
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,640
both with solid evidence

282
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,920
backing it up.

283
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:50,880
It's obvious.

284
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,519
One of them has to be fake.

285
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:54,000
We instinctively trust

286
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,519
what we see,

287
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,600
which makes it hard to distinguish.

288
00:19:57,759 --> 00:19:59,279
But a lie is still a lie.

289
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,360
There has to be a flaw somewhere.

290
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:05,920
My biggest question is,

291
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,120
if Ti Yi really is making
a false accusation,

292
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:11,599
using the contrast between
herself as a 50-year-old woman

293
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:14,160
and a rich, good-looking man

294
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,759
to stir public outrage
and gain attention,

295
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,960
then why specifically target Gai De?

296
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,880
We've seen cases
like this too many times.

297
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,550
If someone wants to help another person,

298
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,000
they usually need a clear reason.

299
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,440
But if they want to destroy someone?

300
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:29,359
Any reason will do.

301
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:34,160
Let's split up.

302
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,940
I'll dig into Ti Yi's background
and the people around her.

303
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,680
You re-examine the evidence
from that night,

304
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,380
and see if any other surveillance
footage caught something we missed.

305
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,260
Keep me updated.

306
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:43,720
Okay.

307
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,759
Liao Siyuan.

308
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,750
Is your investigation
still in the planning stage?

309
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:55,759
Do you need police intervention?

310
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,119
Shu He,

311
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:00,000
I need to tell you something.

312
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,240
I've got in touch with Bai Han.

313
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:04,359
I'll convince him to turn himself in.

314
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,920
Not yet. Give me a little more time.

315
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:10,599
If anything comes up,

316
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,100
I'll reach out to you immediately.

317
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:14,079
Bye.

318
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:24,359
Hello.

319
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:25,359
Chief,

320
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:26,799
we've got a problem.

321
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:29,920
When we ran Ti Yi's
information through the system,

322
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,749
her identity didn't match up at all.

323
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,800
Her documents are fake.

324
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,250
There's no such person in the system.

325
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,720
Have you found out her real identity?

326
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:37,440
Not yet.

327
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:40,599
Based on the phone number
registered with Communications Bureau,

328
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:42,799
the name is still Ti Yi,

329
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:45,079
but everything else is different.

330
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:47,279
And the original owner
of that phone number

331
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:49,359
died ten years ago.

332
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,680
Do you know that falsifying
documents is a crime?

333
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:15,319
Knowing that,

334
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,880
you still used a fake
identity to file a police report.

335
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:19,160
You've got some guts.

336
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:28,480
My identity might be fake,

337
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,039
but the assault was real.

338
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:33,759
Officer,

339
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,620
you're not going to cover
for a criminal, are you?

340
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,519
No.

341
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,400
But first, we need to know
who you really are.

342
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,920
I am Ti Yi.

343
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:50,720
Alright.

344
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:53,759
Then why are you Ti Yi?

345
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:57,559
Why?

346
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:11,759
I found this phone
and SIM card on the street.

347
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,220
I've been using it for almost ten years.

348
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,720
When I went to top up the balance,

349
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,160
I found out the previous
owner's name was Ti Yi.

350
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,480
So I started calling myself Ti Yi too.

351
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,400
As for who I really am...

352
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:35,039
It's been so long.

353
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,079
I don't even remember.

354
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:50,440
You need to tell the truth.

355
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,400
If you want our help,
we need the real story.

356
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,160
I am telling the truth.

357
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,319
I always have.

358
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,030
Using a fake identity,

359
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:12,180
that's a minor offense.
Three days of detention.

360
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,720
Cuff her.

361
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,000
Gai De is a rapist!

362
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,320
He's the one
who should be put behind bars!

363
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,740
He raped Ti Yi!

364
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:29,680
I'm not the one you should arrest!

365
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:31,839
It should be Gai De!

366
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:55,359
Chief,

367
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,720
I'm back.

368
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,640
You got water? I'm so thirsty.

369
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:01,600
I haven't touched this.

370
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,960
Because it's hot.

371
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,110
We've checked everything.

372
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:20,160
All the internal surveillance
cameras are down.

373
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,000
They've been offline for a long time.

374
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,069
Again?

375
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,280
I've noticed the pattern too.

376
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,680
Every time something happens,

377
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,320
the cameras just happen
to stop working.

378
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,839
This footage only shows a back view.

379
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:33,880
If we go by Liao Siyuan's statement,

380
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:35,400
this person isn't Gai De.

381
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Ti Yi has an accomplice.

382
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,200
Look into this impersonator,

383
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,200
and focus on her family connections.

384
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:45,920
Got it.

385
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,240
So, you've made up
your mind to investigate?

386
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,680
On one hand,
I believe Gai De was framed.

387
00:25:58,319 --> 00:25:59,279
On the other,

388
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,240
I admit that I have my own motives.

389
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:04,480
If we can get him out,

390
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,590
he might be the key
to breaking the deadlock

391
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:07,680
and finding Tie Xin.

392
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,559
Okay.

393
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:10,799
Let us help you then.

394
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,160
Gan has connections
in the underground scene.

395
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,640
His guys can help gather intel.

396
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:17,240
Tai is a tech expert.

397
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,559
Hacking a website,

398
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,880
and breaching surveillance
are pieces of cake for him.

399
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,980
If you need anything, just say the word.

400
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,960
Guess that means I'm useless here.

401
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,940
Now you're just being modest, Mr. Bai.

402
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,240
I'm rich.

403
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,319
It's fine.

404
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,279
Just spend it.

405
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,039
Give it to me.

406
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:44,920
I need it.

407
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,559
Just take it back.

408
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,720
It's just a gesture of goodwill.

409
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:56,560
We know the person in the surveillance
footage isn't Gai De.

410
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,359
If we can find the impersonator,

411
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,400
we can dismantle
this airtight evidence chain.

412
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:04,559
Remember the River Spirit case?

413
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:07,720
Of course.

414
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:11,839
The impersonator must be
someone who knows Gai De very well,

415
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:14,799
just like Na Wa knew Tai Shu.

416
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:19,319
The better the familiarity, the easier
it is to pull off a convincing act.

417
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,759
And for everything to go so smoothly,

418
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,559
this person must also have
a close connection with Ti Yi.

419
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:28,559
Have you ever heard

420
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,319
that Gai De had a twin brother?

421
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:33,720
I'm not sure about that.

422
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,160
We can have Gan look into it.

423
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:41,720
Gai De's circle is too complicated.

424
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:44,359
It'd be easier to start with Ti Yi.

425
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:07,039
The atmosphere at this school

426
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:08,160
feels pretty good.

427
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,599
The teachers seem to get along well

428
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:13,160
with each other.

429
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,300
Don't you think there's
something off about this photo?

430
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,599
Everyone's faces are lit from above,

431
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:32,720
but Ti Yi's has even lighting.

432
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,039
This picture must have been edited.

433
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,119
It does look like it's edited.

434
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,200
But why would they be so bold

435
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:46,039
as to display a fake photo
in plain sight?

436
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,759
Ti Yi must have an accomplice.

437
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:52,200
Siyuan,

438
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,550
let's go check out the scene.

439
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,030
There are two main methods
of reasoning that we use,

440
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,440
inductive reasoning

441
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,680
and deductive reasoning.

442
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,510
What are you talking about?

443
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:12,340
Inductive reasoning

444
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,680
moves from specific observations

445
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,680
to a general conclusion.

446
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:17,020
Take the police's evidence chain,
for example.

447
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:19,070
Other than the skin tissue
provided by the victim,

448
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:21,480
there's no trace of
Gai De at the crime scene.

449
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,800
The suspect had strong
counter-surveillance awareness,

450
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:26,079
possibly even professional training.

451
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,240
There's no such thing
as a perfect crime.

452
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,640
If someone committed it,

453
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:31,599
there will be traces left behind.

454
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:34,400
Yes.

455
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:36,279
That's true.

456
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,510
Let's get started.

457
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,880
There are signs
of a struggle on the desk

458
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:46,799
and the corner cabinet.

459
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,799
The whole scene is a mess.

460
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,200
It's likely

461
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,200
that the assault happened here.

462
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,799
It happened at night,

463
00:29:57,599 --> 00:29:59,119
so these lights must have been on.

464
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,160
Based on the layout,

465
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,480
the perpetrator probably

466
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,160
pinned Ti Yi down on the desk like this.

467
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,260
It means his head would have been...

468
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:20,680
So you're saying the light bulb

469
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,160
might have built up static electricity,

470
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,960
attracting dust and hair
from the surroundings?

471
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,590
It means there's a high chance

472
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:31,100
we could find traces
of the perpetrator's DNA on it.

473
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:37,920
Ma'am,

474
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:40,120
I'm with the Buhe Police Department.

475
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,360
I've been instructed
to collect Ti Yi's belongings.

476
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:44,060
Could you please open the door for me?

477
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:46,839
Just make sure to lock
up when you're done.

478
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:47,839
I'm going to bed.

479
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:49,759
Thank you.

480
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,119
As far as I know,

481
00:30:57,119 --> 00:30:59,880
Zhenmei offers some
of the highest salaries in the industry.

482
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:01,359
So why was she living like this?

483
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,839
Judging by the way this place is set up,

484
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:07,160
she never intended to stay here long.

485
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:10,280
It looks like she could pack up
and leave at any moment.

486
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:16,920
She lives alone,

487
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:19,039
and never cooks.

488
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,319
Minimal lifestyle,
and no attachment to material things.

489
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,440
Hello.

490
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:32,279
Okay, send it to me.

491
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,640
They found something?

492
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,440
Scroll it.

493
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:43,680
About the twin brother,

494
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,660
Gan said he couldn't
find any record of him.

495
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,200
But one of his informants

496
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,270
at an underground casino
in Buhe dug up this.

497
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:51,760
She has a gambling habit?

498
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,000
She's been frequenting
casinos for years,

499
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,580
and racked up a mountain of debt.

500
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:59,000
Almost lost a hand
when she couldn't pay up.

501
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:01,839
Judging by the way she's been living,

502
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,839
she probably never quit.

503
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,440
No wonder she's living like this.

504
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,720
What about Tai?

505
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:11,079
Tai tracked her usual movements.

506
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,079
Aside from here and Zhenmei,

507
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:15,549
the place she visits most often

508
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:16,940
is the nearby farmers' market.

509
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:20,880
But her fridge is full of instant food.

510
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:22,599
She doesn't cook.

511
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,180
Why would she go to the market?

512
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,079
According to Tai,

513
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:32,319
surveillance footage shows

514
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,960
that Ti Yi goes to the farmers' market

515
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:36,240
but never buys anything

516
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,000
or talks to anyone.

517
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,119
The only unusual thing she does

518
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,759
is occasionally sit on

519
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:43,160
this seesaw in the park.

520
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,559
Seesaw?

521
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,640
We already know

522
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,440
she has an accomplice,

523
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,040
but she doesn't seem
to have any close friends.

524
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,279
Nothing suspicious
turned up on her phone either.

525
00:32:56,839 --> 00:32:57,920
The most likely explanation

526
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,880
is that her odd behavior

527
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,440
is a way of passing messages.

528
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:05,160
But Tai said

529
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:07,119
he didn't notice anyone suspicious

530
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:07,920
hanging around here.

531
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,080
Someone has to be here.

532
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:10,640
We just overlooked them.

533
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,319
Don't you think

534
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,200
this is all going too smoothly?

535
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,079
What do you mean?

536
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,880
Ever since I started
investigating this case,

537
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,279
every piece of information

538
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:32,480
we've found has been exact.

539
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:36,119
Gambling addiction
and debt are perfect motive.

540
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,039
Unusual behavior at the park,
perfect method.

541
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,119
We haven't even fully
cracked the case yet,

542
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:44,829
but every lead is pointing us

543
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,060
exactly where we need to go.

544
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,460
At this rate, finding the truth
is just a matter of time.

545
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,039
It's too smooth.

546
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,839
Feels like

547
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,960
someone is guiding me.

548
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:10,199
It's not you,

549
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,360
is it?

550
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:20,199
My dearest little brother,

551
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,719
don't overthink yourself into a trap.

552
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,509
How could it be me?

553
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:30,720
I'm with you every single day.

554
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,940
You think I have time to do this
behind your back?

555
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,300
Have you no conscience?

556
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,360
How could you suspect me?

557
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,960
I was just messing with you. Let's go.

558
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,920
You'd better be just messing with me.

559
00:34:47,386 --> 00:34:52,160
(Qi's Pharmacy)

560
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,590
I'm taking you down one day.

561
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,720
Who's wind chime
are you taking down now?

562
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:06,559
Yours.

563
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,360
You think the wind chime will let you?

564
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:11,679
Why are you still up?

565
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,880
So you do remember to come home.

566
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:18,960
I left some supper for you.

567
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,400
Don't say I never save you food.

568
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,840
I'm not hungry.

569
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,159
Of course I do.

570
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Shrimp dumplings?

571
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:36,840
You made these?

572
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,639
How is it?

573
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:48,920
Siyuan,

574
00:35:51,159 --> 00:35:53,239
you've grown up.

575
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,519
You keep secrets now.

576
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,039
But that's okay.

577
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,320
I just want you to know,

578
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,280
that even if Liao Zhibai is gone,

579
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:06,800
I will always have your back.

580
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,110
No matter what kind
of trouble you run into,

581
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:12,000
you have to tell me first.

582
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:15,639
You women always overthink things.

583
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:17,599
Since when do I keep secrets from you?

584
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:19,320
Don't we always talk about everything?

585
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:20,679
Don't try to sweet-talk me.

586
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:23,640
I know you've kept many
things from me over the years.

587
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,920
I'm not trying to blame you for it.

588
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,159
I just want you to remember

589
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:33,119
that I won't let anyone bully my son.

590
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:34,920
If anyone dares to mess with you,

591
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,119
I'll take them down!

592
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,000
Take them down!

593
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:38,000
Take them down!

594
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:44,480
Look at you, such a pretty girl,

595
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,400
and all you talk about
is fighting and killing.

596
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,040
All your suitors are going
to run for the hills.

597
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:54,639
You call me a pretty girl?

598
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,199
Aren't you a pretty girl?

599
00:36:58,199 --> 00:36:59,199
Such a sweet talker.

600
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,639
Chief,

601
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,670
Liao Siyuan was here earlier.

602
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:22,000
He asked me to give this to you.

603
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,639
What is it?

604
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,559
Send it to the lab
for a thorough analysis.

605
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,480
Got it.

606
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,920
Ti Yi's detention period ends today.

607
00:37:36,039 --> 00:37:37,559
Assign someone to keep an eye on her.

608
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:39,320
No problem.

609
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,519
By the way,

610
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:44,000
about the real Ti Yi...

611
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,320
I dug up her case.

612
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:46,880
It was buried deep.

613
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,639
I spent a long time on it.

614
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,880
She was a vocal student

615
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,360
at Buhe Academy of Arts,

616
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,920
but in reality,

617
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,140
she was doing a lot of side work,

618
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,550
selling herself

619
00:37:58,039 --> 00:37:58,920
for extra cash.

620
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,280
As for her family,

621
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,040
her father passed away a long time ago,

622
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,519
and her mother died of an illness

623
00:38:04,519 --> 00:38:05,679
about ten years ago.

624
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:07,400
So basically,
she had no close family left.

625
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,360
As for the fake Ti Yi,

626
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,960
she claims she just found the SIM card

627
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,400
and went along with it.

628
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:17,599
Maybe it was just a coincidence.

629
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,440
How did the real Ti Yi die?

630
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,559
Murder.

631
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:28,960
She was working as a call girl,

632
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,440
and one time, she and a client

633
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,400
couldn't agree on the price.

634
00:38:33,559 --> 00:38:34,880
Things got heated.

635
00:38:35,719 --> 00:38:37,199
And that was the end of her...

636
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,639
Find me

637
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:41,559
the original case file.

638
00:38:41,559 --> 00:38:42,079
Got it.

639
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:44,880
Oh,

640
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:48,679
Gai De's chauffeur just arrived.

641
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:50,509
Do you want to question him now,

642
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:52,140
or do you want to take a break first?

643
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,559
Here, I come here all the time.

644
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:28,700
The owner is a great guy.

645
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,000
He goes out to the sea every morning
to catch fresh squid,

646
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,840
so it is super fresh.

647
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,470
And the taste is like the squid
we used to get outside our academy.

648
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:34,980
Try it.

649
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:35,719
Really?

650
00:39:35,719 --> 00:39:36,320
Try it.

651
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:45,519
It's really good.

652
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,800
But to be honest,

653
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:52,239
I never actually ate
at that place near the academy.

654
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:54,880
Really?

655
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:58,490
You always went to the cafeteria
instead of eating with us.

656
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:01,000
I missed out.

657
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,360
But how did you

658
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,920
end up becoming a chauffeur?

659
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,600
Being a chauffeur is pretty good.

660
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:08,760
What's wrong with it?

661
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,190
Look at our graduating class,

662
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,600
how many of them are doing well?

663
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:13,400
You're probably the most successful one,

664
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:14,710
but the salary isn't that great.

665
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,280
And don't even mention

666
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,180
the ones assigned
to small-town police stations.

667
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,220
They're earning even less.

668
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:20,679
I probably make

669
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:22,960
a lot more than you guys now,

670
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:26,239
so this meal is on me.

671
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,420
Don't even try to argue.

672
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,719
I won't.

673
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:37,840
I remember back then,

674
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:41,199
you guys used to follow
Liao Zhibai around,

675
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:44,000
talking about how you
were all going to be heroes.

676
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,840
When did that change?

677
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,760
Growing up and making choices
all happen in an instant.

678
00:40:57,559 --> 00:40:58,559
What choice?

679
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,480
Back then, with Liao Zhibai...

680
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,519
He tried to pull me in,

681
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:06,719
but I refused.

682
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,400
The other four had
a history of drug use.

683
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,960
I was the only one who didn't,

684
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,920
so I stopped hanging around them.

685
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,159
And if I had to choose again?

686
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,780
I'd make the same decision.

687
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:26,119
Alright, enough with the small talk.

688
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,920
We're both in law enforcement.

689
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:30,320
Or at least, I used to be.

690
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:33,550
I know how this works.

691
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,110
You brought me to the station

692
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,760
because you want information
on Gai De, right?

693
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:41,599
Yes.

694
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:43,440
But the moment I saw it was you,

695
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,380
I figured there was no need
for old classmates

696
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:47,520
to have this conversation
under a surveillance camera.

697
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:48,719
Here's just fine.

698
00:41:49,159 --> 00:41:50,199
You talk,

699
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:51,599
and I listen.

700
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:53,480
If you happen to say
something you shouldn't,

701
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,940
I'll pretend I didn't hear it.

702
00:41:57,519 --> 00:41:58,199
Shu He,

703
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:01,360
looks like your principles have changed.

704
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,880
We're all just earning a fixed salary.

705
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,380
What's the point of being so rigid?

706
00:42:07,719 --> 00:42:08,719
So, did your boss

707
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,079
use the car that night?

708
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,400
I'm not sure about that.

709
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,199
He just told me to take the night off.

710
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,000
After I handed over the keys,

711
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,599
whether the car was used or not,

712
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,920
you guys can check the GPS.

713
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,360
We already did.

714
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:22,920
The vehicle's GPS shows

715
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:24,710
that it was at Zhenmei that night.

716
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:26,190
I really don't know anything.

717
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:27,639
I'm just a chauffeur.

718
00:42:27,639 --> 00:42:28,639
I just drive the car.

719
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:30,079
All I can say is,

720
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,039
I didn't touch it that night.

721
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,560
If he really was up to something,

722
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,639
he wouldn't have

723
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:44,480
asked you to drive him anyway, right?

724
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,039
Exactly. That's just common sense.

725
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:51,109
Alright, it's time.

726
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,760
I have to go pick up my kid from school.

727
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:54,320
Let's catch up another time.

728
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:55,519
