00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:18,924
(Year 2011, Meet Bar)

2
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,600
Here, let's toast.

3
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,559
There's no more wine. Pour me wine.

4
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:26,120
Here, pour wine.

5
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,679
I need a toilet break.

6
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,600
I opened eight bottles of wine
for you in one night.

7
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,920
Don't be shameless when given face.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,060
Come on.

9
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,439
Mr. Ku Ya.

10
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,799
You know our rules.

11
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:44,439
You're a regular customer.

12
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,800
I don't offer that kind of service.

13
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:52,759
I make the rules.

14
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:57,920
Mr. Ku Ya.

15
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:58,880
Mr. Ku Ya.

16
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,120
Let's talk it out.

17
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,000
Talk what?

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,600
Mr. Ku Ya, let me go.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,880
Let me go.

20
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,840
Let me go.

21
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,640
Show yourself.

22
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:12,799
Who did this?

23
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:31,280
Beat her.

24
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,599
Beat her.

25
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,120
Mind your own business.

26
00:03:42,337 --> 00:03:50,900
=The Embers=

27
00:03:52,551 --> 00:03:54,710
=Episode 7=

28
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,030
A small amount of human tissue

29
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:58,639
was found in the deceased's nails.

30
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,140
We haven't found a matching DNA

31
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,000
so far,

32
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,439
but we can confirm

33
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,919
that it's a female's DNA.

34
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,800
According to the latest information
provided by Liao Siyuan,

35
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,120
Lemon Convenience Store's
female employee, An Ni,

36
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,920
is likely to have committed the crime.

37
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:13,319
Chief.

38
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,560
An Ni.

39
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,120
She was imprisoned
for causing a traffic accident

40
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,310
and intentional injury before.

41
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,060
There's a high possibility
that a released prisoner with a record

42
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,750
will commit a crime again.

43
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,480
Liao Siyuan provided you with this clue?

44
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:26,920
Where is he?

45
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:29,759
Oh no.

46
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,079
Look.

47
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,959
There's nothing here.

48
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,759
Siyuan, check out the wardrobe.

49
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,720
Madam.

50
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,959
When did you buy this wardrobe?

51
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,240
Siyuan, watch out!

52
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,319
Don't move!

53
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:20,920
Police!

54
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,020
Crouch down
with your hands on your head.

55
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:35,759
Chief.

56
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,519
An Ni's report is out.

57
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:40,680
Take a look at it first.

58
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:56,800
Chief.

59
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,680
She signed it?

60
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:10,920
She signed it.

61
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,519
Your DNA

62
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:14,680
doesn't match the DNA

63
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,880
in the deceased's fingernails.

64
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:16,520
What?

65
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,439
Why plead guilty?

66
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,199
Officer.

67
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,519
I've been to jail before.

68
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:37,040
If I said I was innocent,

69
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,199
Officer Ni won't believe me.

70
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,199
Don't talk nonsense.

71
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,069
My interrogation process
is entirely legal,

72
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:49,140
and all the video and audio recordings
are intact.

73
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:50,879
Besides,

74
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:52,600
why did she attack Siyuan

75
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,279
when we rushed in

76
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,800
if she had nothing to hide?

77
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:00,720
Officer, I'm really innocent.

78
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:03,079
I thought he was a scammer,

79
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:05,399
who disguised himself
as a university student

80
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:08,199
to rob old ladies
who live alone like me.

81
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,240
I'm innocent.

82
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,100
She always complained about being poor

83
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,600
but took out such a large sum of money
before she died.

84
00:07:35,253 --> 00:07:37,310
(Withdrawal of 2 Million Puna.)

85
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:18,360
Hello? Cha Peng.

86
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:19,319
Liao Siyuan.

87
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:20,920
You asked

88
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:22,759
if Nu Na left anything for you.

89
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:24,509
I found a photo

90
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,180
while taking inventory
at the bridal shop.

91
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,800
It should be what you're looking for.

92
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,320
Okay, I'll come over immediately.

93
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,159
Hello? Cha Peng.

94
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,039
Cha Peng.

95
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:37,919
What happened?

96
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,279
Cha Peng!

97
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,279
What went wrong?

98
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,879
We did make a mistake this time.

99
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,440
I'm so sorry.

100
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,080
It doesn't matter.

101
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,799
As a citizen,

102
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:16,080
I should support your work.

103
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:18,720
Thank you.

104
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,000
If there's nothing important,

105
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,000
could you stay in Buhe City

106
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:24,879
for now?

107
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:26,960
Sure.

108
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,399
I'm going to go now.

109
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,679
Goodbye.

110
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:40,399
Chief.

111
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,919
Forensics sent new evidence.

112
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,159
An Ni was in a cafe

113
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:45,679
on the night of the crime.

114
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,320
She might have

115
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:49,399
really thought
Liao Siyuan was a bad guy.

116
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:53,320
Did you check her son?

117
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,679
I did.

118
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:55,639
He's called Pei Ji

119
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,519
but is not related to An Ni by blood.

120
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,380
It's just that one is without a mother
and the other is without a child.

121
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,840
Both of them were also ex-convicts.

122
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,120
They share the same experience.

123
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,559
That's why they live together.

124
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:12,639
Cha Peng.

125
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:14,639
Cha Peng.

126
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:16,000
Wake up.

127
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,279
Cha Peng.

128
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:20,399
Here.

129
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:22,600
I...

130
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:23,720
What happened?

131
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:27,960
I was alright.

132
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,799
I didn't see anything.

133
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:31,759
Someone hit me with a stick.

134
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,000
Where's the photo?

135
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,039
It's gone.

136
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,799
Do you remember what's in the photo?

137
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,240
There seems to be a fire or something.

138
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,519
The photo is quite blurry.

139
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,159
Nu Na was in it.

140
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:58,919
And...

141
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,919
And the doctor
who was exposed in the news.

142
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,630
The one who killed many girls...

143
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:04,240
Song En?

144
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,720
Yes, it's him.

145
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,900
There are two other people
I don't recognize.

146
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,240
There are two other people?

147
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,360
There are four in total.

148
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:18,960
Are you sure?

149
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:20,759
Yes.

150
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:23,879
Siyuan.

151
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:25,840
Come here.

152
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:27,919
Hurry.

153
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,080
Nu Na.

154
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,000
Man Ni.

155
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,600
Except for the first page
which was torn,

156
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,200
Nu Na's and Man Ni's names were on it.

157
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,559
Meet Bar?

158
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:51,799
Isn't this the bar
Nu Na asked you to meet her at?

159
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:02,399
I've taken inventory
of all the wedding dresses in the shop.

160
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,720
We lost three sets in total.

161
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,120
Including Nu Na's, it's four sets.

162
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,759
I wonder

163
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:15,600
if two more people will die.

164
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:21,960
It's just a speculation.

165
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,630
It's up to you to believe me.

166
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:26,120
I've always felt that this matter

167
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,279
might not be over.

168
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,159
I'm scared just thinking about it.

169
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,640
When Nu Na was alive,
she always complained about being poor.

170
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,759
And now?

171
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,580
She took out a large sum of money
before she died.

172
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,510
I don't even know what it's used for.

173
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:42,639
Money?

174
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,159
What money?

175
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:47,720
That one.

176
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,840
I didn't see the money,

177
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,100
but I found a withdrawal receipt.

178
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:54,120
Did she owe someone money?

179
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:58,639
I don't know who she owes money to.

180
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,870
Debts are cleared after death.

181
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,840
It's none of my business.

182
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:10,759
This belongs to the bar.

183
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,600
It's been about seven or eight years.

184
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,320
I didn't expect her to keep it.

185
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,200
When was the last time you saw Nu Na?

186
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,639
Just two days ago.

187
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,240
Nu Na came often.

188
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:24,679
Whenever she encountered
something she couldn't figure out,

189
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,039
she came over to talk to me

190
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,000
and ask me.

191
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:29,759
That day...

192
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,960
I want to tell him the truth
before I leave.

193
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:35,799
It's considered my atonement.

194
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:38,320
I should have told him earlier,

195
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:40,159
but I was too cowardly.

196
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,480
This photo

197
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,519
is the beginning of my nightmare.

198
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,440
Wait.

199
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,360
You said you saw that photo before?

200
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:54,799
There's someone behind you.

201
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,120
I came here alone.

202
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:57,919
A man.

203
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,340
He's been following you for many years.

204
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,159
That's not right.

205
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,879
Seriously?

206
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:08,200
She can actually see me?

207
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,279
He shouldn't belong here.

208
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,860
He should have entered the Six Realms
of Reincarnation long ago.

209
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,670
Do you want exorcism?

210
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,720
Today's special offer is 20% off.

211
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:19,799
A talisman to ensure
your lifelong safety and peace.

212
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,679
I'll tell you what happens next
after the exorcism.

213
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:24,600
What are you doing? She's a fraud.

214
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,440
Why don't you burn this money
and give it to me?

215
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:30,759
Did Nu Na say

216
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:32,519
when she got the photo?

217
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:33,919
The photo?

218
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,799
I remember it was about five years ago.

219
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,960
She was still working here at that time.

220
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,120
I think
someone from her hometown sent it.

221
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,240
She didn't say who.

222
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,200
I've been thinking about it
these past two days.

223
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,390
These four girls

224
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:48,629
were so close back then.

225
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,420
They ate together...

226
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:49,980
Wait.

227
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,120
Did you just say four girls?

228
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:53,919
Yeah.

229
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,879
The four of them used to be together.

230
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,040
Who else are there
besides Nu Na and Man Ni?

231
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:00,559
Nu Na, Man Ni,

232
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:01,919
Lin, Xu Man.

233
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,840
Four of them.

234
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,639
Are you still in touch with them?

235
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:06,879
Not really.

236
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,279
Lin is the first to marry

237
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,559
but lives the worst life.

238
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,879
She seems to live
at No. 13, Xinma Street.

239
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:16,679
What about Xu Man?

240
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,279
Xu Man?

241
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,679
She has the best life among them.

242
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:23,200
She's a wealthy heiress.

243
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,749
Her father is from Southeast Asia.

244
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,840
He came to Buhe City
for business in his early years.

245
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,080
After giving birth to Xu Man,

246
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,480
he abandoned her.

247
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:31,909
It's particularly strange.

248
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:34,160
Suddenly one day her father
sent someone to pick her up,

249
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,740
saying he wanted her to go home
and inherit the family property.

250
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:38,919
She became very successful from then on.

251
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,919
Do you know where she is now?

252
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:44,120
I'm not sure about that.

253
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,320
But she's probably not in Buhe City.

254
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:51,279
I see.

255
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:54,980
Speaking of,

256
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,879
what's the first page that was torn off?

257
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,879
Do you remember?

258
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:00,399
It's been too long.

259
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,679
How could I remember?

260
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,840
Why are you asking this?

261
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,879
What's the matter? Are you interested?

262
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:06,879
No, thank you.

263
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:11,559
Based on this logic,

264
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:12,720
the murderer had a plan.

265
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,680
The four wedding dresses

266
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,480
correspond to the four people
she mentioned.

267
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:16,509
Now that two are dead,

268
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:17,820
there are only two targets left.

269
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,390
Xu Man and Lin.

270
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:20,919
But Xu Man isn't in Buhe City.

271
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,190
How are they going to kill her?

272
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,279
But Lin's here.

273
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,240
We must save whoever we can.

274
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,720
Zhibai, have you ever thought

275
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:32,919
that Lin might be the one

276
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:34,639
who was with Man Ni
and Nu Na that night?

277
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,960
Xu Man isn't in Buhe City.

278
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,120
It's Lin who handed over the tissue.

279
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,720
Watch out!

280
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,080
Lin is the only one

281
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,790
who knows
the truth about our house's fire.

282
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:54,639
Siyuan.

283
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,039
Let's go to the hospital first.

284
00:16:57,799 --> 00:16:58,600
We don't have time.

285
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,639
I failed to protect Nu Na.

286
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,510
I hope I can protect her friends.

287
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,119
No. 13, Xinma Street.

288
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:10,440
Alright, I'll tell them.

289
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,039
Be safe too.

290
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:14,039
Shu He.

291
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,140
You came just in time.

292
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,490
The drug test results are out.

293
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,560
I'm the one
who submitted the application.

294
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,900
How come the result is with you?

295
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:22,400
AH7.

296
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:31,039
What's AH7?

297
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:32,160
Is it a drug?

298
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,240
It is a new type of drug

299
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,720
that has just appeared on the market.

300
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,799
Its hallucinogenic effect

301
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,240
is about ten times stronger
than ordinary drugs.

302
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,839
I suspect that AH7

303
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:43,359
contains saffron-colored watercress.

304
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:45,319
Those who die from taking this drug

305
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,340
would have
a mysterious smile on their faces.

306
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,240
The sellers

307
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,480
took advantage of this feature

308
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:50,400
and announced

309
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,559
that you will die

310
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,319
in the happiest situation possible
even if you die.

311
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:56,119
So more people want to try it.

312
00:17:58,039 --> 00:17:59,039
I'm telling you.

313
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,280
You can investigate the case
all you want.

314
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,839
Drug dealers
are all desperate criminals.

315
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:05,839
What if you encounter any danger?

316
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:06,839
But

317
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:09,519
if I really run into them head-on,

318
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:11,200
I think

319
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,759
they should be the ones to worry,

320
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,200
not me.

321
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,359
Qi Xia.

322
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:26,759
It's related to the case ten years ago.

323
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,040
Liao Siyuan is a family member
involved in the case.

324
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,420
He can't touch this case anymore.

325
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:33,680
Where is he?

326
00:18:48,263 --> 00:18:51,190
(Lin)

327
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,559
Come down.

328
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,600
You don't have to worry
about this case anymore.

329
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,680
Come down.

330
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,839
My people will be here soon.

331
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,440
You can't touch this case anymore.

332
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,310
Go home immediately.

333
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:24,269
Why?

334
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,680
You don't have the right to ask why.

335
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,820
Just follow my orders.

336
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,680
The drug test report is out.

337
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:34,680
AH7.

338
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,079
The drug your brother took.

339
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:44,519
As far as I know,

340
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:46,400
Liao Zhibai
has been assisting the police

341
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,960
in investigating AH7.

342
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,759
How did he get addicted to drugs?

343
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,599
We're still investigating
the exact cause.

344
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,920
You're lying!

345
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:55,839
You liar!

346
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,200
My brother didn't take drugs.

347
00:19:57,759 --> 00:19:58,200
Siyuan.

348
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:58,880
Hurry and say

349
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,680
that my brother didn't take drugs.

350
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,279
Tell them my brother didn't take drugs!

351
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,160
There's no way
my brother would take drugs!

352
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,799
Hurry and say it!

353
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,200
You're all liars!

354
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:26,279
Is this case

355
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,960
really related to our house's fire?

356
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:33,519
So you mustn't

357
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:34,680
touch this case again.

358
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,120
I'll investigate it thoroughly.

359
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:48,559
You're the least qualified to say this.

360
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:56,490
It's the police force's rule
not to let you investigate.

361
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,160
No one can break the police's rules!

362
00:20:58,279 --> 00:20:59,440
Can you not be like Zhibai

363
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,480
and follow some rules?

364
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,820
This is where you'll never
be as good as my brother!

365
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,100
You stick to old rules
and are rigidly doctrinaire.

366
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:05,960
Get out of the way!

367
00:22:02,228 --> 00:22:04,500
(2009/05/29)

368
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:16,319
Zhibai.

369
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,000
Zhibai.

370
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,880
Dr. Bian Ming.

371
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,920
(Bian Ming,
Liao Siyuan's Attending Physician)

372
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,799
Long time no see.

373
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:36,119
Siyuan.

374
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,759
Why am I in the hospital?

375
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:45,440
You fainted.

376
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,319
Your sister sent you here.

377
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,519
What is this medicine I'm receiving?

378
00:23:57,079 --> 00:23:58,079
A bit of sedative.

379
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,920
The same one you used
when you were a kid.

380
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,720
It temporarily blinds you

381
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,039
to things that shouldn't exist.

382
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:11,480
It's been several years since you
stopped taking your medicine, right?

383
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,839
Do you still see Zhibai recently?

384
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,680
I meant

385
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:25,759
occasionally.

386
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:28,880
No.

387
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:31,880
I haven't seen him for a long time.

388
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,920
The test results won't lie.

389
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:40,119
You can trick them,

390
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,240
but you can't trick me.

391
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,720
It's because I'm your doctor.

392
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:49,279
But don't worry.

393
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,039
I won't tell them.

394
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:56,000
The temptation of the virtual world

395
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,960
must be hard for you to resist.

396
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,319
But think about it.

397
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:05,160
If there's a computer

398
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,599
that is always turned on

399
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:10,839
and running a game with large memory,

400
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:12,519
then its CPU

401
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:13,880
is likely to be burned out.

402
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:17,599
The same goes for your brain.

403
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:23,359
Fantasy and reality.

404
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,079
Blue pill

405
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,599
and red pill.

406
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:31,279
They might be hard for you to choose.

407
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:35,880
I hope your brain isn't fried

408
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,279
next time I see you.

409
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,359
Sorry.

410
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:01,599
I shouldn't have struck him.

411
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,220
I should be the one to apologize to you.

412
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,680
As long as he struck,

413
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,720
it's his fault.

414
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,319
As a colleague,

415
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:14,680
I trust your professional judgment.

416
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,440
But you also know

417
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,070
the damage the fire caused to him

418
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:19,400
ten years ago.

419
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:21,559
Stop provoking him.

420
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:27,680
Don't you think

421
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,310
he's becoming
more and more like Liao Zhibai?

422
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,560
I'm worried he'll follow
the same old path as Zhibai

423
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,279
if this continues.

424
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,160
Shu He.

425
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,160
You don't know Liao Zhibai,

426
00:26:39,319 --> 00:26:40,720
or Liao Siyuan,

427
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,519
but I know them.

428
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:43,160
Yes,

429
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,060
but you're also in the police force.

430
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:49,839
The case ten years ago
is indeed suspicious,

431
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,280
but we have to believe in the evidence.

432
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:56,400
I know this.

433
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,920
You don't need to remind me.

434
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,320
I don't mean anything else.

435
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:05,000
I just want you to understand

436
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:07,200
that AH7 has disappeared for ten years.

437
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:08,960
Now that it reappeared,

438
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:10,269
no one knows if it's related

439
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,240
to the case back then.

440
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,620
Our current judgment criteria
are still based

441
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,380
on the evidence from back then.

442
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,799
Okay, I promise you.

443
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,960
I won't mention this
to Liao Siyuan anymore,

444
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,319
but you must also promise me

445
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:26,960
to keep an eye on your brother.

446
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,590
Don't let him hinder
the police from investigating.

447
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,720
I've made exceptions for him many times.

448
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,839
I'll head back first.

449
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,079
Chief.

450
00:27:52,085 --> 00:27:56,770
(Ou Wen)

451
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:01,720
Is Siyuan alright?

452
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,640
He's alright. Why are you here?

453
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:06,759
I was afraid you were too busy to eat,

454
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,000
so I brought you some food.

455
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:12,279
You should eat and go back to rest.

456
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,160
Take care of your body.

457
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,120
Otherwise,
how can you take care of your family?

458
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,680
I can't rest.

459
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,640
I have to go to Lin's house

460
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,080
and then go back to the police station
to do an autopsy.

461
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,240
I'll escort you then.

462
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,559
My car is right downstairs.

463
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:28,079
Sure.

464
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:34,960
Zhibai.

465
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,680
Why did Nu Na

466
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,440
withdraw such a large sum of money
before leaving?

467
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:48,000
Three wedding dresses
are missing from her store.

468
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,319
Two have reemerged.

469
00:28:54,759 --> 00:28:56,319
If the last one doesn't appear,

470
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,079
it means more people will die.

471
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:04,960
But Xu Man isn't in Buhe City.

472
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:12,759
Where would
the remaining wedding dress be?

473
00:29:29,297 --> 00:29:31,970
(Qi's Pharmacy, Healing hands
as warm as the spring breeze.)

474
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,260
They don't allow me to drink,

475
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,240
but I insist on drinking.

476
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:02,400
I'm back.

477
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:03,480
You're back.

478
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:05,279
You must be tired.

479
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,559
Here.

480
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,839
Drink a glass of water
to relieve fatigue.

481
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,039
I heard that you guys solved the case.

482
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,640
The...

483
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,480
The serial murder case
of the woman in the wedding dress.

484
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,260
Has the murderer been caught?

485
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,799
Where did you hear this rumor?

486
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,799
The internet.

487
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:30,680
It's all over the internet.

488
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:33,960
We caught the wrong person.

489
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,119
The wrong person?

490
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,759
Although the DNA
in the victim's fingernails

491
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,279
showed that she was a female,

492
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:44,880
it didn't match that of the suspect.

493
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,079
I've compared them.

494
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,920
My daughter is amazing.

495
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,960
I have to hurry and reply to them.

496
00:30:56,279 --> 00:30:57,559
I can't wrongly accuse someone.

497
00:30:58,279 --> 00:31:00,400
You can't wrongly accuse someone.

498
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,640
You can't wrongly accuse someone.

499
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:04,119
What's this?

500
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,599
What's this?

501
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:08,400
It isn't yours?

502
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,359
It's not mine.

503
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,160
I'll throw it away then.

504
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,519
Xia.

505
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,140
I have something serious
to discuss with you.

506
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:19,960
Jeez.

507
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,590
Do you have a junior named Ou Wen?

508
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,400
Were you from the same school?

509
00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:29,599
If I remember correctly,

510
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,799
he pursued you when you were in school.

511
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,780
And now he has been transferred
to your police station.

512
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,119
Would you like to consider him?

513
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:42,759
No need.

514
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,360
Because we've developed a relationship.

515
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,920
We're getting married.

516
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:49,680
Good night.

517
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,079
You're getting married?

518
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,079
Really?

519
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,640
You didn't even tell me
about such a big deal.

520
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,020
Remember to go to the hospital
to see your son tomorrow.

521
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:08,799
The hospital?

522
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:24,559
How did it go?

523
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:26,119
Did you get through?

524
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,310
The phone is turned off.

525
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,279
You said Xu Man is in Buhe City.

526
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:34,079
Really?

527
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,200
Of course.

528
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,480
Didn't Liao Siyuan say

529
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,520
that there are four people in total
including Nu Na?

530
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,880
I recorded their names.

531
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,519
When did she arrive in Buhe City?

532
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,519
Probably recently.

533
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:49,160
I think she said she came to buy rubber.

534
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,940
The person who received her
happened to be my father's friend.

535
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,120
I happened to hear it.

536
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,640
I want to tell Liao Siyuan

537
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,319
as soon as I got the news.

538
00:32:56,839 --> 00:32:58,920
Where did this unreliable guy go?

539
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,900
Nothing bad has happened to him, right?

540
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:02,960
It hasn't come to that.

541
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:05,120
He'll stay in the hospital
for two days at most.

542
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,440
The hospital?

543
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,960
You hide everything from me.

544
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:17,680
He...

545
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,280
You're always hiding things from me.

546
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:23,880
He...

547
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,640
He had a fight
with Shu He from the police force.

548
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:33,119
I see,

549
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,559
but I still have to tell him about this.

550
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:44,640
Are you telling me?

551
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,480
You're not telling me?

552
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:53,960
Ms. Meihua.

553
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:55,799
I'm really okay.

554
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,519
Shu He and I just had a little...

555
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:01,480
A little conflict.

556
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,440
A little conflict?

557
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,160
A little conflict
sent my son to the hospital?

558
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,039
A little conflict.

559
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:10,719
He just shoved me.

560
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:13,079
How dare he shove you?

561
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,580
What was he trying to do?

562
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,079
Is he a primary school student?

563
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,280
It's called school bullying, alright?

564
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,030
Just wait and see.

565
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,639
What are you doing?

566
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,159
Stay out of this.

567
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:26,960
I'll have someone beat him up.

568
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,280
How dare he bully my son?

569
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,679
He has a death wish.

570
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:30,920
No.

571
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,840
Xia still has to work with him.

572
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,559
Perfect timing.

573
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,800
I don't want Xia to work anymore.

574
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,519
Ask Xia to quit this hard, tiring,

575
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:38,679
and unprofitable job.

576
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,540
I wanted her to quit this job long ago.

577
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:41,679
I can support you guys.

578
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,400
I can afford it anyway.

579
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:44,280
No.

580
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:46,760
Don't you want me to be safe and secure?

581
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,550
You wanted me
to study, graduate, and find a job.

582
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:50,920
If you beat him now,

583
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,260
how am I supposed to graduate?

584
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:55,079
Hello? Ms. Meihua.

585
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,880
Hello my foot.

586
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,440
Bye.

587
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,159
Am I right?

588
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,760
If it affects your graduation...

589
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,159
Once you graduate

590
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,760
and get your diploma,
I'll have someone beat him.

591
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,280
As soon as I get my diploma,
you can find someone to beat him.

592
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,000
Beat him!

593
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:13,639
Beat him!

594
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,760
How dare he bully my son?

595
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:17,400
He has a death wish.

596
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:19,360
You have to remind me by then.

597
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:25,519
Beat him.

598
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,400
How dare he bully my son?

599
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:28,440
Ms. Meihua.

600
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,400
Alright, since I'm fine,

601
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,039
why don't you go home and rest?

602
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,199
I know you find me annoying.

603
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,440
No.

604
00:35:36,519 --> 00:35:37,519
No?

605
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,629
I need to pee.

606
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:39,460
Can I use the toilet?

607
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,320
Wait.

608
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,920
I want to pee too.

609
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,040
I can't hold it in anymore.

610
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,719
Why don't you
go to the public restroom outside?

611
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:49,039
How stingy.
You won't even let me use the toilet.

612
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,440
Siyuan, we...

613
00:35:57,519 --> 00:35:58,079
I...

614
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,519
You came out so soon.

615
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,800
You don't have a prostate problem,
do you?

616
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,360
You pee frequently.

617
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:07,960
You're a little too fast.

618
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,400
When you were little,

619
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,400
you held your pee in
because you refused to pee.

620
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:12,960
Go in and try again later.

621
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:14,480
Let it all out.

622
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:16,480
How worrying.

623
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:23,679
Come out.

624
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:25,679
Siyuan, is your prostate okay?

625
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:27,440
Liao Siyuan.

626
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,320
You have a prostate problem?

627
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,199
But seriously,

628
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,239
you're so lucky

629
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:32,400
to have such a good mother.

630
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:33,360
Get down to business.

631
00:36:33,639 --> 00:36:35,039
Yes, I almost forgot about it.

632
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,960
Do you know
Xu Man has arrived in Buhe City?

633
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,519
Do you want to meet her?

634
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,039
How?

635
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,660
Don't have to worry about it.

636
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,580
We have a solution.

637
00:37:12,891 --> 00:37:19,920
(Xu Man)

638
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,599
Why is there a new driver?

639
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:44,239
Where's Ta Ku?

640
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:48,030
Ta Ku suddenly had stomach cramps

641
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:49,280
and went to the hospital.

642
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:50,480
I'm his cousin.

643
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,320
I'll drive you around
in the next two days.

644
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:55,519
Just call me Liao.

645
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:01,119
You look young.

646
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,079
Are you still a student?

647
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:05,719
I'm already 28.

648
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:26,960
You seem quite familiar with Buhe City.

649
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:28,920
Have you been here before?

650
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:36,239
Of course I'm familiar.

651
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,320
I lived here for more than ten years.

652
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:39,239
Is that so?

653
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,280
Then you

654
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,119
should meet your old friends this time.

655
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:46,039
Let me know

656
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:47,599
if you need a ride.

657
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,599
Sure.

658
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:51,000
Thank you.

659
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:55,840
But I probably don't need it this time.

660
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,199
It's better to stay indoors.

661
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:01,960
Buhe City
hasn't been peaceful recently.

662
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,400
There have been several murders.

663
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,840
I heard it's related to wedding dresses.

664
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:08,679
Wedding dresses?

665
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:09,559
Yes.

666
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:11,719
Have you ever received

667
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:13,199
a wedding dress package

668
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:15,920
in your hotel room?

669
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,760
I've been in Buhe City
for over ten days

670
00:39:22,519 --> 00:39:24,239
and haven't received any package.

671
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,540
I didn't expect you
to have been here for so long.

672
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:33,740
It's okay
that you didn't receive any package.

673
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:36,119
Didn't Ta Ku tell you?

674
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:39,920
Sorry.

675
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,679
I overstepped.

676
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,400
It's alright.

677
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:50,599
I quite like you.

678
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,719
Ms. Xu Man, we're here.

679
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,159
It's getting late.

680
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,159
You should rest.

681
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,199
It's indeed late.

682
00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:24,039
Good night.

683
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,559
Good night.

684
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,760
Liao Siyuan.

685
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:37,800
Over here.

686
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:40,590
Lower your voice.

687
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:43,700
I've settled everything.

688
00:40:44,199 --> 00:40:45,159
Her hot water pipe

689
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:46,719
will burst in three minutes,

690
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:48,760
unless...

691
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,460
Unless she doesn't shower.

692
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:51,920
Yeah.

693
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:53,840
But that's impossible.

694
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:56,000
Buhe City is so darn hot

695
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,280
that you wish
you could shower three times a day.

696
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,599
We'll proceed according to plan later.

697
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:01,760
Find the stuff.

698
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,760
I'll help you keep watch.

699
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:03,320
Sure.

700
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:06,719
Why did you suddenly send me a message

701
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,740
asking me to come over

702
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,680
and destroy this pipe?

703
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:10,360
Things are not what we thought.

704
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:11,560
Come here. I'll tell you.

705
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,199
Why are you keeping me in suspense?

706
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,599
I thought she would be
the murderer's next target,

707
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,840
but she didn't seem to care at all.

708
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,760
And she had arrived
in Buhe City long ago.

709
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:22,079
It's possible
that she herself is the murderer,

710
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,800
so the drug she used to commit murder

711
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,280
is probably hidden here.

712
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:39,840
Villa 2562.

713
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:40,880
Yes.

714
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:42,920
The hot water pipe here is broken.

715
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:48,760
Ms. Xu.

716
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:51,400
It's alright.

717
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:52,320
Ms. Xu.

718
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,280
Ms. Xu.

719
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:03,719
Ms. Xu Man.

720
00:42:13,159 --> 00:42:13,960
Ms. Xu.

721
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:17,199
Ms. Xu.

722
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,639
I was halfway out

723
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:20,120
when I suddenly heard an explosion.

724
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:20,900
Are you okay?

725
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,480
I was about to shower,

726
00:42:22,519 --> 00:42:23,400
but somehow

727
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,599
the water pipe burst suddenly.

728
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,280
The hot spring water

729
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,239
splashed everywhere.

730
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,280
Did you burn yourself?

731
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,320
No.

732
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,320
Here.
I'll call the front desk right away.

733
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:31,880
No need.

734
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:32,880
I just called them.

735
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,920
The front desk said
the repairman was off duty.

736
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,040
It would take at least an hour
to send someone over.

737
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:38,760
How about this?

738
00:42:39,079 --> 00:42:40,400
Rest in the living room.

739
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:41,720
I'll come in and take a look.

740
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,000
Sorry for bothering you.

741
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:47,719
Please come in.

742
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,120
Alright.

743
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,180
It's on the second floor.

744
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:49,820
Alright.

745
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:52,920
Be careful. The water is hot.

746
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:53,920
It's alright.
