00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,240
- Open it!
- Open it!

25
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,360
There are countless ways to kill Lai La.

26
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:34,719
But why did the murderer put her head
inside a stone?

27
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:37,960
There are only two possibilities.

28
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:39,680
First, to challenge the police.

29
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:40,800
Second,

30
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,080
the murderer has

31
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,159
a fetish for dismemberment.

32
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:45,840
It's quite common among serial killers

33
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,199
like Laxton from the UK

34
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,800
and Issei Sagawa from Japan.

35
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,000
But what we're seeing now

36
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,599
can't lead us to solving this case.

37
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,199
Just now, they mentioned

38
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:56,759
that a doctor picked Lai La up
from campus that day.

39
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:58,599
His car was parked right outside

40
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,360
when he picked Lai La up.

41
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:06,879
That's the doctor
who bought the raw jade.

42
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:08,360
Do you suspect him?

43
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,590
When I saw him
at the police station yesterday,

44
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,120
I found something strange about him.

45
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,639
Besides, he left too quickly.

46
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,000
That means he didn't admit

47
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,120
that he knew Lai La.

48
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,340
Or he wouldn't have been allowed
to leave so soon.

49
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,700
And surveillance
mustn't have captured the murderer

50
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,120
entering or leaving Lai La's place.

51
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,960
If it had, the police wouldn't have
found you

52
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,080
through the delivery bag.

53
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,520
I doubt the theory that the murderer
was inside her place

54
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,839
could work.

55
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:36,560
Let's check out the clinic.

56
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:45,519
Go ask the patients

57
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,800
to find out what time he was away

58
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,920
over the past few days.

59
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,319
Okay.

60
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:58,680
Sir.

61
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,720
I noticed you had a detained needle
in your arm.

62
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,540
Do you come here for an IV drip
every day?

63
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:04,839
Yes.

64
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,439
Was the doctor here four days ago?

65
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,160
No, he wasn't.

66
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,380
Dr. Song is very busy.

67
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,959
But it's fine.

68
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,120
If he isn't here,

69
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:21,560
Ms. Fish prepares my meds.

70
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,600
What are you looking at?

71
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,959
Nothing. Did you find anything?

72
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,270
The day before the murder,

73
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,800
he was gone
the entire afternoon and evening.

74
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,040
Only the nurse was here.

75
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,800
Hi.

76
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:46,800
Siyuan,

77
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,160
don't draw attention.

78
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:48,920
Let's leave now.

79
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,600
Are you not feeling well?

80
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:04,680
I came to visit someone here.

81
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,199
Bye, Dr. Song.

82
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:09,720
Hold on.

83
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,600
You don't remember me?

84
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:23,040
I'm Song En.

85
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:25,120
Song En.

86
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,199
No wonder.

87
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,630
You were just a little boy back then.

88
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:35,120
I used to

89
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,000
run a clinic in your village.

90
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,600
Does that ring a bell?

91
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,399
I'm not sure.

92
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:47,079
It's good, though.

93
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,680
It was a tragedy for your family,
after all.

94
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,439
It's fine
if you don't remember anything.

95
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,120
I've almost forgotten

96
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:58,600
what happened back then.

97
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,160
I have a lecture to attend.
I need to go.

98
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,759
It's rare for us to meet.

99
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,639
As your elder,

100
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,000
let's have a meal together.

101
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:14,439
You have patients waiting.

102
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,680
Maybe next time. It's on me.

103
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,160
Don't let me keep you.

104
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:38,120
You know where the body is?

105
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,639
I found some liquid

106
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,040
inside the victim's nasal cavity.

107
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,440
The head was once soaked in water.

108
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,120
But without the body,

109
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,700
we can't be sure if she drowned

110
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,440
and if she died
before entering the water.

111
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,900
However, one thing we can confirm is

112
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:49,920
that this is river water.

113
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:50,800
River water?

114
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,800
There are many rivers in Buhe.

115
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:53,840
Can we narrow it down?

116
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,480
(Qi Xia, Forensic Pathologist)
Apart from diatoms and microorganisms

117
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,730
(of Buhe City Criminal Police Squad)
commonly found in river water,

118
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:58,640
there's something else.

119
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:02,240
Incense plaster.

120
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,000
Siyuan,

121
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:22,639
the body is somewhere around here.

122
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,199
Here?

123
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,360
Precisely.

124
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,040
The only temple in Buhe City

125
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:31,439
near the riverbank.

126
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,800
How did you know the body would be here?

127
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:40,879
This is what

128
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,080
I'm going to teach you.

129
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:45,200
There are two methods of reasoning.

130
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,720
Inductive Reasoning

131
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,200
and Deductive Reasoning.

132
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,960
The former is an analyzing process

133
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,800
that goes from the specific
to the general,

134
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,000
while the latter works
in the opposite direction.

135
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,720
In criminal investigations,

136
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,960
these two methods are often inseparable.

137
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,480
(Inductive Reasoning, Deductive Reasoning)
I know this might sound a bit dull,

138
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,600
so let me walk you through

139
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:02,679
an example.

140
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:05,120
Look at this shoe.

141
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,279
The mud on the toe

142
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,320
is fresh.

143
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,240
It was put behind
the other shoes in a rush,

144
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:11,480
so they forgot

145
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:12,279
to clean it.

146
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,780
The edge of Song En's car tires

147
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,150
is also stained with the same mud.

148
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,200
It's the same as the shoe.

149
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,320
The temple discards incense ashes
by the riverside

150
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,440
once in a while.

151
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,840
As the river rises and falls,

152
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,240
covering the ashes,

153
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,440
they turn into incense plaster
over time.

154
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:26,440
That's the same thing found on Song En's

155
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:27,440
shoes and tires.

156
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,679
That's why he was here?

157
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:29,909
Exactly.

158
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,320
This is the classic Syllogism Theory

159
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,799
in Basic Deductions.

160
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:34,039
Syllogism Theory works

161
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:37,080
by having a major premise of A over B

162
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,440
and a minor premise of B over C

163
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,200
to draw the conclusion that A is over C.

164
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:43,240
The only place in the city with
incense plaster is along this river.

165
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,260
That's the major premise.

166
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,360
Song En's shoes

167
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,000
and tires have the same incense plaster,

168
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,120
which makes a minor premise.

169
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,080
Removing the incense plaster
from the equation,

170
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,030
we reach the conclusion

171
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:55,480
that Song En has been to the river.

172
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,350
If he had been here,

173
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:59,680
his shoes would have
been stained with the incense plaster.

174
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,480
Song En was here,

175
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,879
that's why his tires and shoes

176
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,559
were stained.

177
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,550
Why does this feel like

178
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:07,360
a conditional statement?

179
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:09,799
You're so gifted.

180
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,270
You're making great connections.

181
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,519
Even if we prove that he came
to the riverbank,

182
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:15,840
how do we prove he was here
to dump the body?

183
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:16,879
Right.

184
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,399
Did you notice

185
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,440
that Song En's car is new,

186
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:21,840
and there's a scratch mark

187
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,440
on the trunk?

188
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:25,000
Do you know why?

189
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,270
He didn't go straight back
to the clinic that afternoon.

190
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:34,519
He probably planned to dump the body
into the river at night.

191
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:36,120
However, in the darkness,

192
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,480
he overlooked the traces

193
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,799
on the tires and trunk.

194
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,000
Plus, there are no cameras
at the riverbank,

195
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,600
which is why he let his guard down

196
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:45,519
and failed to clean the traces in time.

197
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:48,440
Your argument is
based on inductive reasoning.

198
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,799
But the body has sunk underwater.

199
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,159
I can't handle this alone.

200
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,720
Looks like the police have traced
the evidence here.

201
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,300
We discovered
that Song En had been there

202
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,690
through a series of investigations.

203
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:46,960
How did you know about that?

204
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:04,440
Come.

205
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:06,759
Let's start.

206
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:14,519
The cut surface is flat and smooth.

207
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,039
This is a classic sharp-force injury

208
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:17,279
that led to hypovolemic shock.

209
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,550
The facial muscles are tense

210
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:20,679
and show signs of stiffening.

211
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:21,960
Her smile

212
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,789
could be a side effect
of excessive narcotics usage.

213
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:27,060
We need further examination
for toxicological results.

214
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,000
But

215
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:29,960
why is there no lividity?

216
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,269
Lividity forms due to blood deposition.

217
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:34,220
If she was dismembered
immediately after death,

218
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,200
massive blood came out,

219
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,590
and lividity wouldn't be as visible.

220
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,380
The third cervical vertebra

221
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,050
is severed, and there are no
bioactive reactions at the neck flap.

222
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:42,790
It shows that she didn't die
from beheading.

223
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,280
She was likely beheaded after death.

224
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,270
There are bruises on her limbs
before she died.

225
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,960
The victim was likely to be assaulted

226
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,679
or tortured.

227
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:52,480
Previously, we found some fluid

228
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,700
inside her mouth and nose.

229
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,360
Could she have drowned?

230
00:12:59,360 --> 00:12:59,960
Scalpel.

231
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,440
Are you actually waiting for your sister

232
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:19,279
or Lai La's autopsy report?

233
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:26,919
I understand how you feel.

234
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,600
Lai La was your friend.

235
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,200
I almost forgot

236
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,680
you and my brother
were friends once, too.

237
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,039
What's it?

238
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,039
Her lungs and bronchi are clean,

239
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:51,080
with no water or mud.

240
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,100
So she was placed
in the water after death.

241
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:53,879
She didn't drown.

242
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:55,200
Also, the neck flap

243
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,420
shows no bioactive reaction.

244
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,700
She didn't die from beheading.

245
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,519
So what killed her?

246
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:02,759
I found a needle mark on her arm,

247
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,600
and her body fluid

248
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,620
tested positive for drugs.

249
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,720
The cause of death could be

250
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,320
an overdose from ingestion or injection.

251
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,159
Aside from that,

252
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:11,279
an unknown toxin was found.

253
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,100
I've sent it to the headquarters
for testing.

254
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,460
The results will be out in a week.

255
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:17,600
And...

256
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,759
she was pregnant.

257
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:46,919
Pregnant?

258
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:50,120
Even though Lai La...

259
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:52,720
I don't think so.

260
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,360
Do you remember someone once said

261
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:57,159
Lai La got into someone's car?

262
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,919
I saw Lai La getting into his car

263
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:01,039
after school.

264
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,679
That guy owns a clinic.

265
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,720
I suspect it's related to that doctor,

266
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,639
Song En.

267
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,799
Do you have proof?

268
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:13,480
No.

269
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:16,200
But I'll find it.

270
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:18,200
I swear.

271
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,600
Are you done?

272
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,759
My neck is stiff.

273
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:27,240
It's done.

274
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:29,000
It's been half an hour.

275
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,240
It's very vivid

276
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:33,840
and lifelike.

277
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,080
Uh, I'm off.

278
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,960
The key is with you, right?

279
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:41,440
Remember to lock the door.

280
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,420
(Two Hours Ago)
Deputy Chief Ni,

281
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,029
we found this

282
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,740
in the inner pocket
of Lai La's clothing.

283
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,039
I need to use the restroom.

284
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:11,279
You're still here?

285
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,159
Hand me the torch.

286
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:39,720
Lai La didn't smoke,

287
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,159
but why was she carrying a lighter?

288
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,360
What's more, she put it
in the inner pocket of her clothing.

289
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:58,000
A love hotel?

290
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,200
As Xia said,

291
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:01,039
Lai La didn't die from drowning.

292
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,080
This means

293
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,919
the riverbank isn't the murder scene.

294
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,200
Drugs,

295
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,000
pregnancy,

296
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,720
and now this love hotel.

297
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,319
What does that make you think?

298
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,160
Could this be

299
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:23,039
the message

300
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:25,400
Lai La was desperate to send out?

301
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:29,240
Maybe

302
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:31,559
this is where

303
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,920
Lai La was killed.

304
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,359
Excuse me.

305
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,720
Have you seen them before?

306
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:44,759
I'm sorry.

307
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:47,519
We can't break
our customers' confidence.

308
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:52,079
That's not working at all.

309
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,000
Give him some tips.

310
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:01,079
According to the law,

311
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:03,680
organizing or sheltering prostitution

312
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,060
is sentenced to imprisonment
of up to five years.

313
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:07,640
Should I call the police now,

314
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,160
or will you do me the favor?

315
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,200
I recognized them.

316
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,960
You speak Chinese?

317
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,480
When did you see them?

318
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:18,960
I think it was four nights ago.

319
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:20,839
The night Lai La was murdered.

320
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,680
Good. Book me a room.

321
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,279
The same one they used.

322
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:08,319
The marks on the table corner are new.

323
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:10,079
It's been a few days,

324
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:11,960
so the room has probably been cleaned,

325
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,780
but bloodstains can't
be removed completely.

326
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:16,160
Siyuan, did you bring Luminol?

327
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,400
This is the murder scene

328
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,519
of Lai La's death.

329
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:52,440
Xia mentioned

330
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,030
there were bruises on Lai La's body.

331
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,039
She was likely abused before death.

332
00:19:58,359 --> 00:19:59,480
The marks on the table corner

333
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,400
suggest that Lai La and Song En
had an argument,

334
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:03,519
and Song En hit Lai La's head there.

335
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:07,640
Lai La struggled

336
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,680
and ran toward the door.

337
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:14,160
The drag marks on the floor

338
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,319
were formed
when Song En pulled her back.

339
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,440
There are also marks on the chair
caused by a rope.

340
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,759
Lai La was injected with drugs

341
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,519
and couldn't resist.

342
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,720
The murderer controlled her

343
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,119
and killed her in this chair.

344
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:55,640
Then, he cleaned up the mess,

345
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,319
packed up the body into a suitcase,

346
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:00,240
and dumped it somewhere.

347
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:04,799
Now, this room is the evidence
we're looking for.

348
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,519
It could lead us to the suspect.

349
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,960
Siyuan, call the police now.

350
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:15,839
No.

351
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,119
Who is it?

352
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:21,599
Open the door!

353
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,079
Zhibai.

354
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:55,880
Zhibai.

355
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:04,319
Zhibai.

356
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,480
(Zhibai,)

357
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,519
(help me.)

358
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,559
Zhibai.

359
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,839
Zhibai.

360
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:28,720
Run.

361
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,960
I won't let you die.

362
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:37,839
Xia.

363
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,279
Xia.

364
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:46,960
Put that look away.

365
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,350
You jumped from the fifth floor.

366
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,400
Were you completely mad?

367
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,559
I'm still in one piece.

368
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,039
You'd better explain this

369
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,759
to me.

370
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:18,200
The entire room

371
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,880
was on fire.

372
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,559
That was the only way to escape.

373
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:29,880
Have a seat.

374
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,740
What's your relationship with that girl?

375
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:36,920
We were classmates.

376
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,880
Only classmates?

377
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,200
Siyuan,

378
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:44,559
you almost died in the fire

379
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:46,559
for someone you barely knew.

380
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,200
Was it worth it?

381
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,160
A word to the wise.

382
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,880
Stop talking.

383
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,359
She's about to blow up.

384
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:01,079
Xia,

385
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:05,039
you've been in service for so long.

386
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,400
Is every victim

387
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,759
a family member or a friend to you?

388
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:20,799
We were just chatting
and attending lectures

389
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:23,680
a few days ago,

390
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,960
and suddenly, she turned into
a cold corpse.

391
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:32,759
Why was she killed

392
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:35,279
in such a cruel way, really?

393
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:37,400
Xia,

394
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,440
does none of this matter?

395
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:57,359
I've been thinking about

396
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:01,880
what she was trying to tell me
that night.

397
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:06,640
It was just like ten years ago.

398
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:12,440
If I hadn't insisted on bringing
Zhibai home,

399
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:16,519
he wouldn't have died.

400
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,599
He died because of me.

401
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:31,960
But why am I still alive?

402
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:36,720
How could I?

403
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,200
Siyuan.

404
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,880
It's not your fault for staying alive.

405
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:58,799
Thank you for not dying.

406
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,640
I can only carry on

407
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:09,119
if you're still alive.

408
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:14,200
(She's Qi Xia.)

409
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,559
(My brother's fiancee.)

410
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:18,440
Show your palms.

411
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,480
Block.

412
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:22,759
Follow.

413
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,550
I won, Zhibai.

414
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:24,920
(After the fire,)

415
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,079
(she found me)

416
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,039
(in the orphanage.)

417
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:29,880
I won!

418
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,160
I finally beat you!

419
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,000
How's my brother's condition?

420
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,440
He inhaled a large amount of smoke,

421
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,760
which caused him to pass out.

422
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,800
Fortunately, he was rescued in time.

423
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,590
He's all right now.

424
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,830
He just needs a full check-up

425
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:17,820
before being discharged.

426
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:18,550
That's a relief.

427
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:20,720
However,

428
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,079
while we were examining his brain,

429
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:23,720
we noticed

430
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:25,480
some neural circuit damage.

431
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,359
This could cause hallucinations.

432
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,840
He might see people or things
that don't actually exist.

433
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,839
Also, he has no memory of him

434
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:33,920
jumping off the building.

435
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,200
This could develop into a risk

436
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,550
of dissociative identity disorder.

437
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:39,640
I read through his medical records.

438
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,680
He took

439
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:43,240
psychotropic medication before, right?

440
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:46,359
Yes.

441
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,559
It was a few years ago.

442
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,640
He stopped taking it when he recovered.

443
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:52,680
Does he still

444
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,559
have hallucinations?

445
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:54,480
I'm not sure.

446
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,279
I suggest you take him
for a full brain scan

447
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,839
after discharge.

448
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,069
All right. Thank you.

449
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:01,980
Don't mention it.

450
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,720
Siyuan.

451
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:21,799
Siyuan.

452
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,720
Siyuan.

453
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:25,680
Siyuan.

454
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:27,573
(Qi Meihua,
Liao Siyuan's adoptive mother)

455
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:28,599
Siyuan!

456
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:30,119
I'm here. Stop shouting.

457
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,559
Siyuan.

458
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,759
Are you all right, my son?

459
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:38,109
Turn around.

460
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,140
- Mom.
- Don't be scared.

461
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,620
Mom, this is a hospital. Keep it down.

462
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:41,780
- I'm fine.
- Keep it down.

463
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,039
You annoying boy!

464
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,559
You scared me to death.

465
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,510
I got a call from the police

466
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:50,000
early in the morning

467
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,559
saying that something happened to you.

468
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:55,039
I didn't even finish my liquor

469
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,000
before rushing hotfoot here.

470
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,720
I'm okay.

471
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:00,400
They were just making a fuss

472
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,000
and had me come in for a check-up.

473
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,920
Look, I'm perfectly fine.

474
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:06,359
As if.

475
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:09,680
You're a cop yourself.

476
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,380
Why didn't you protect your brother?

477
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,480
(She's Qi Meihua,)

478
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:15,000
(Qi Xia's mom.)

479
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,279
(After that fire,)

480
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:19,039
(she and Qi Xia)

481
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:20,279
(adopted me.)

482
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,340
(But she doesn't like me
to call her "Mom",)

483
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:26,400
(so I call her "Ms. Meihua".)

484
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,000
You brought a liquor bottle
to the hospital early in the morning.

485
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:29,640
Why?

486
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,820
Did you forget to put it away
last night?

487
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,640
It's none of your business.

488
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,640
Where are your manners?

489
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,240
Hey,

490
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,279
don't you get cute with me!

491
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,279
Tell me!

492
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:40,000
What were you up to?

493
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:40,720
Tell me.

494
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,559
Tell me.

495
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:50,720
Mom,

496
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,880
I lost my memory.

497
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,079
No one answering, huh?

498
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,640
In that case,
I'll intoxicate myself to death.

499
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:27,097
(Healing hands as warm
as the spring breeze)

500
00:31:27,122 --> 00:31:31,120
(Qi's Pharmacy)

501
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:32,440
(Yuan, I want steamed ribs for dinner.)

502
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,110
(Pretty, I won't be home
for dinner tonight!)

503
00:31:34,115 --> 00:31:35,490
(I'm not coming home
for dinner tonight.)

504
00:32:34,011 --> 00:32:37,880
(Officer Shu He solved an arson case
caused by drug abuse.)

505
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:40,880
Siyuan,

506
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:43,400
are you thinking about
the arson from ten years ago again?

507
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:45,519
Yes.

508
00:32:46,402 --> 00:32:49,666
(Liao Zhibai, the genius detective,)

509
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:52,930
(committed arson
due to drug-induced hallucinations.)

510
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,680
If I tell you,

511
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:03,559
the police report is real

512
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:07,160
and I did it all by myself,

513
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,920
