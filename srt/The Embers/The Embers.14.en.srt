(Yong'an Village, 2009)

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,039
Help! Help!

3
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,240
Help! Help!

4
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:19,879
Su Pa!

5
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:20,760
Are you okay?

6
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,879
It's okay, it's okay.

00:02:59,383 --> 00:03:08,960
=The Embers=

8
00:03:10,595 --> 00:03:13,080
=Episode 14=

9
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,620
Xia, what did you find?

10
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:20,629
Looks like

11
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,440
the body was encased
in concrete as a whole.

12
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,080
Judging by the level of decomposition,

13
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,360
it's been there for years.

14
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,080
To avoid damaging any evidence,

15
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,600
we have to transport it
back to the station for examination.

16
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,580
Let's bring it back to the precinct.

17
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,840
Do you remember

18
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,879
that crack Jie En made a long time ago?

19
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,120
Yes, but we were too far away

20
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,000
to see anything clearly at the time.

21
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:00,520
If he had seen the body back then,

22
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,919
why didn't he say anything?

23
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,800
My son...

24
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,159
Oh, Tai Shu, my son...

25
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:07,879
Tai Shu,

26
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,639
Mom and I are here to see you.

27
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,680
Oh, Tai Shu...

28
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,240
Tai Shu.

29
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,199
Let me touch my son.

30
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:14,479
Let me touch him.

31
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:15,360
This is odd.

32
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,480
Oh, son...

33
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,000
I thought Tai Shu

34
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,400
didn't get along with them.

35
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,420
Why do they seem this heartbroken?

36
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,520
After all, they're still family.

37
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,959
Family isn't just about blood.

38
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,800
It's also about love and protection.

39
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,160
After everything Tai Shu did to them,

40
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,920
whatever bond they had was long gone.

41
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,959
You suspect them?

42
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:42,439
But I am not targeting them.

43
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,480
From a motive standpoint,

44
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,560
there are plenty of people in this
village who wanted Tai Shu dead.

45
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,639
We can't rule them out.

46
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,680
Oh, son...

47
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,199
Mom...

48
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:59,040
Mom, take it easy.

49
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,439
You have to watch your health.

50
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:01,279
Mr. Na Wa.

51
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,639
Granny Yun.

52
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:04,399
My condolences.

53
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,040
Mom,

54
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,040
I'll take care of the arrangements.

55
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,720
Na Wa,

56
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,160
once the case is closed,

57
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:17,639
just scatter his ashes into the river.

58
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:19,399
No need for anything complicated.

59
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,160
You're Na Wa?

60
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,560
Yes, officer.

61
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,519
While the prosthetic eye
suggests the body is Tai Shu,

62
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,959
we still need to be thorough.

63
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,720
I'll need both of you

64
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,199
to provide DNA samples

65
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,100
for verification.

66
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,279
Okay.

67
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:40,839
We have to do a DNA test, Mom.

68
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,480
Tell me,

69
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,980
this statue has been here
for over a decade, right?

70
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:46,720
That's right. Why?

71
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,439
Has it ever been damaged or renovated?

72
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,120
Yes,

73
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,600
about five years ago.

74
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,000
The River Spirit statue
had weathered pretty badly,

75
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,580
so the village pooled money together

76
00:05:58,839 --> 00:05:59,959
to have it recast.

77
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,000
I remember we were supposed
to finish the work in another day or so,

78
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,800
but the next morning,

79
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,820
the workers showed up and found
the statue already completed.

80
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,140
Back then, we thought

81
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,480
River Spirit had finished the job.

82
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,079
Yes. The River Spirit showed his power.

83
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:13,120
Everyone saw it.

84
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,840
If you don't believe me, ask around.

85
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,600
Yes.

86
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,160
The River Spirit showed his power.

87
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,720
He really did.

88
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:19,519
Mr. Na Wa,

89
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:20,800
five years ago?

90
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,199
The same time Tai Shu disappeared?

91
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,600
I can't say for sure,

92
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:29,759
but yes, it was around that time.

93
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,270
And no one thought it was suspicious?

94
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,279
We hold deep respect
for the River Spirit.

95
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,319
Everyone who passes by bows in worship.

96
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,740
Who would even think
that there was a body hidden inside?

97
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,190
That's terrifying. Who would
dare suspect something like that?

98
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,600
Mom.

99
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,600
Officer,

100
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,600
should I take my mom home first?

101
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,160
I'm worried this is too much for her.

102
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,959
I'll leave

103
00:06:58,399 --> 00:06:59,560
this case to you guys.

104
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,360
If there's anything I can help,

105
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,680
just tell me.

106
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,439
Come on, Mom.

107
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:05,800
It's okay, come on.

108
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,439
Oh, my son.

109
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:06,879
Mom.

110
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:08,439
- Son...
- Easy, Mr. Na Wa.

111
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:08,959
Mom.

112
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:11,040
My son...

113
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:13,560
It's okay, Mom.

114
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,759
- Son...
- Don't cry.

115
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:15,920
Don't cry.

116
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,360
The killer must have murdered Tai Shu

117
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:25,560
during the statue's
renovation five years ago

118
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,800
and sealed his body inside.

119
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:28,759
Then, they impersonated Tai Shu

120
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:29,920
to escape Yong'an Village.

121
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,199
Killing Jie En

122
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,800
and mimicking his movements
to withdraw money

123
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:38,920
was all a diversion.

124
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,560
Since they knew Tai Shu that well,

125
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,300
it was almost certainly
someone close to him.

126
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,439
Who asked for your opinion?

127
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:52,000
No one's talking to you.

128
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:54,759
How annoying.

129
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,279
Tell him to go away.

130
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:23,920
We compared

131
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,319
the victim's DNA with Na Wa's.

132
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:26,160
It's confirmed

133
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,980
that the body belongs to Tai Shu,
who disappeared five years ago.

134
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,060
The fatal wound is on
the left side of his chest,

135
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:34,190
a deep, penetrating injury
straight through the heart.

136
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,269
Based on the wound,

137
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:37,600
the murder weapon was likely
a long, narrow metal blade.

138
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,879
From the evidence at the scene,

139
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,520
it looks like he was stabbed from behind

140
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,820
with a right-handed attack.

141
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,759
What's interesting

142
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:47,200
is that the wound shape

143
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,320
is very similar to Jie En's,

144
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,120
but something about it feels different.

145
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,639
Different how?

146
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,240
I need to take another look.

147
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,960
Even though the body
is severely decomposed,

148
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,840
the skeletal structure suggests

149
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,840
he was in a struggle before he died.

150
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,240
It's possible he was killed accidentally

151
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,720
during a fight.

152
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,080
But unfortunately,

153
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,000
we haven't found

154
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,080
any other DNA on him yet.

155
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,159
Normally,

156
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:14,600
a body sealed in concrete for this long

157
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,480
would've started smelling ages ago.

158
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,720
Why is it only being discovered now?

159
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:21,320
The killer wrapped the body
in multiple layers,

160
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,750
activated charcoal, plastic film,

161
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:24,000
and then sealed it with latex.

162
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,639
Combined with the local climate,

163
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,060
it effectively trapped any odor.

164
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,440
Have we confirmed the time of death?

165
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:33,440
I cross-checked

166
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,680
the timeline of the River Spirit
statue's reconstruction

167
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,600
with the victim's disappearance.

168
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,519
Based on that,

169
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:40,200
his estimated time of death

170
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,440
should be around May 2014.

171
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:47,279
And the date you and Liao Siyuan

172
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,000
found on the bus ticket?

173
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:50,600
May 21.

174
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,480
So the killer murdered Tai Shu,

175
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,260
sealed him inside
the River Spirit statue,

176
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,360
and then went to the bus station,
bought a ticket,

177
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,080
and made a scene with the ticket seller
to leave a lasting impression

178
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,440
before leaving Yong'an Village.

179
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,480
Even though their method was clever,

180
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,440
they clearly anticipated the possibility
of being found out one day.

181
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:12,559
Their plan was meticulous
and calculated.

182
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,679
But here's what's strange,

183
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,480
if the same person is
responsible for both murders,

184
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,600
and they knew Tai Shu was already dead,

185
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,240
why go through the trouble

186
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,200
of impersonating him to kill Jie En?

187
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,980
In the River Spirit murder case,

188
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,840
Tai Shu was the prime suspect.

189
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,879
But now we know he's
been dead for years.

190
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,720
Do you think these two cases

191
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,600
are just a coincidence?

192
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,240
It's possible.

193
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,440
But one thing definitely
isn't a coincidence.

194
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,159
Tai Shu was connected

195
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:16,879
to the fire at our house.

196
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
So far,

197
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,080
three people from that photo are dead.

198
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:25,840
It's Bai Han again?

199
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:28,480
I'm not sure.

200
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,000
If it was Bai Han,

201
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:34,480
he did have the motive to kill Tai Shu.

202
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,120
But why would he kill Jie En?

203
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,240
And why go through the trouble
of impersonating Tai Shu to do it?

204
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:42,639
That directly led
to Tai Shu's hidden body

205
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:44,039
being exposed.

206
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:46,240
It doesn't make any sense.

207
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,000
I don't think he's that stupid.

208
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:49,919
About Jie En's death,

209
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,679
I have a theory.

210
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:56,399
I think the day he smashed
the River Spirit statue,

211
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,600
he saw Tai Shu's body.

212
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,440
And he must've figured
out who the killer was.

213
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,460
So he went to blackmail them,

214
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:04,519
but he ended up

215
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:06,879
getting himself killed.

216
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:09,840
Your theory relies on
two key assumptions.

217
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:12,080
First, that Jie En knew
who the killer was,

218
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,440
and second, that he had something
he wanted from them.

219
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:19,039
He was already
the richest man in the village,

220
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,620
so it definitely wasn't money.

221
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,080
If not money, then what?

222
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,260
Could Tai Shu and Jie En

223
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,180
have had a common enemy?

224
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:33,720
I don't know about that,

225
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,039
but I heard they got along well.

226
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,300
They used to drink together
all the time.

227
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:44,159
We suspected Tai Shu before

228
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:48,120
because everyone else had an alibi.

229
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,840
No one could've traveled
between the upper stream

230
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,600
and Water Lantern Festival site
in 40 minutes.

231
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,260
But now that we know
Tai Shu was already dead.

232
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,399
The only person without an alibi

233
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:01,519
is Madam Ke Xin.

234
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:03,559
Ke Xin?

235
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,900
Is it possible?

236
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,039
What are you doing?

237
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,759
I'm looking at the toilet's water tank.

238
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:20,240
Every time it flushes,

239
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,000
after a few seconds,

240
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,399
it automatically refills.

241
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,320
No kidding.

242
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,750
If it didn't refill,
how would the next person use it?

243
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,360
Exactly.

244
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,720
That means
there's a time gap in between.

245
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,159
A time gap?

246
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:47,320
I know how the killer did it.

247
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,360
Go on, Siyuan.

248
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:11,360
What's going on?

249
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,480
To create the perfect atmosphere
for Water Lantern Festival,

250
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,000
the dam stores water a day in advance

251
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,919
and releases it on the festival day.

252
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:29,919
The time when the body
drifted downstream was fixed,

253
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,120
just like the festival's entry time.

254
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:34,879
The killer needed this certainty.

255
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,759
They used the dam's water release

256
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:38,639
to manipulate our perception of time

257
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:41,000
and create an alibi.

258
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,120
But that still doesn't explain

259
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,600
how the killer managed

260
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,840
to control the body's movement

261
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:49,600
from a distance and make it float
toward us exactly on time.

262
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:50,840
Do you remember

263
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,300
when we were kids at the orphanage?

264
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,030
The toilets had a row of squat stalls,

265
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,080
with a water tank mounted above them.

266
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,840
The pipes kept refilling non-stop.

267
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,840
When the water pressure
reached a certain limit,

268
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,220
it would automatically flush.

269
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,840
That's it! Using the same principle,

270
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:05,159
they could

271
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,080
dispose of the body
without leaving a trace.

272
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:09,120
The timing mechanism

273
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,320
is right down there.

274
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,600
I saw it.

275
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,120
The killer...

276
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:57,320
The killer used that submerged tire

277
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,039
to dispose of the body.

278
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,000
The body and the bamboo raft

279
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:09,360
were hooked onto the tire in advance.

280
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,720
Then, the killer lit the candles

281
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,020
before leaving the scene.

282
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,390
When the dam released the water,

283
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,930
the rising water level lifted the tire.

284
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:18,000
Once it reached a pre-set height,

285
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,380
the rope snapped,
releasing the raft right on cue.

286
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,120
That's how the body drifted toward
us at the exact time they wanted.

287
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,360
The so-called alibi

288
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:29,000
doesn't hold up anymore.

289
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:31,120
Which means

290
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,440
everyone at Water Lantern Festival

291
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:37,000
is a suspect.

292
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:52,720
No.

293
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:56,080
That's fast. It's fixed now?

294
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,399
The repair shop belongs
to a friend of mine.

295
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:59,039
He's one of us.

296
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,639
Since you guys were in a hurry,

297
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:02,039
I asked him to put a rush on it.

298
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,149
It wasn't too complicated.

299
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,500
Just needed a fresh coat of paint.

300
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:05,700
Thank you so much, Mr. Na Wa.

301
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,340
- If I had to take it in myself...
- Xia.

302
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,240
Siyuan, you're back.

303
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,160
The car's done?

304
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,400
Isn't it fast?

305
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,400
The tires were replaced too?

306
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,440
Sharp eyes, kid.

307
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,359
The front tire

308
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,400
was too worn down,

309
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,880
so I had them swap it for a new one.

310
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:24,680
It's Na Wa.

311
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,519
Hello.

312
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:38,799
Hello, Siyuan.

313
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,720
I just found a crossbow bolt

314
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,720
at Mr. Na Wa's house.

315
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,920
It looks just like
the one used to kill Tai Shu.

316
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,960
You don't think

317
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,279
Mr. Na Wa is the killer, do you?

318
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:26,880
Li Zhi, listen to me.

319
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:28,640
Get out of there right now

320
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,119
and go find Su Pa.

321
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,720
I'm already at the gas station.

322
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,880
But I was so freaked out

323
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,380
that I didn't bring the bolt with me.

324
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,880
Okay. Stay put.

325
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,240
I'm coming over now.

326
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:41,359
Come on, let's go find Qi Xia.

327
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:48,880
Su Pa?

328
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:53,759
If Na Wa is the killer,

329
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,200
everything makes sense.

330
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,880
He was Tai Shu's brother.

331
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,519
He could've easily mimicked his gait

332
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,119
to throw us off.

333
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,240
The evidence points to him,

334
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,839
but the motive is unclear.

335
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:07,960
In my memory,

336
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,759
Mr. Na Wa has always been kind

337
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:12,440
and warm-hearted.

338
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,420
Why would he do something like this?

339
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:18,000
Maybe he was pushed to the edge.

340
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,920
Even a cornered rabbit will bite.

341
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,400
Whether it was a crime of passion
or a premeditated murder,

342
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,839
those are acts of impulse.

343
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,110
But impersonating the River Spirit,

344
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,160
and keeping up the charade
for five years straight

345
00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:31,920
takes an immense amount

346
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,039
of patience and effort.

347
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,720
Why would he go through all that?

348
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,920
By spreading the rumors
about the River Spirit,

349
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,079
he made the villagers fear

350
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,720
and worship it.

351
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,359
And no one would ever
discover Tai Shu's body.

352
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,160
Isn't that reason enough?

353
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:50,720
But if his only goal was

354
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,440
to cover up the murder,

355
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,120
wouldn't it make more sense for him

356
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,480
to make everyone forget about

357
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,880
the River Spirit instead?

358
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,599
Su Pa is missing!

359
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,200
What?

360
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,600
She was here when I was calling you,

361
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,360
but the second I looked away,
she was gone!

362
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,790
Do you know
where she might've gone?

363
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,359
No... She must've gone to find Na Wa.

364
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:18,400
I don't know.

365
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:19,759
Get in.

366
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:22,039
Na Wa!

367
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,880
Come out, Na Wa!

368
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,920
Why did you pretend
to be the River Spirit?

369
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,400
Su Pa.

370
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,759
Don't worry.

371
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,359
Su Pa will be fine.

372
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,960
I just don't get it.

373
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,640
Why is Na Wa doing this?

374
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,480
Su Pa never did anything to him.

375
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,920
How could he hurt her?

376
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:28,359
Madam Ke Xin,

377
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,620
let me comb your hair for you.

378
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,640
It's fine.

379
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,839
Where is my hairpin?

380
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:34,759
I have to use my hairpin.

381
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:35,519
Hairpin?

382
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:37,079
My hairpin.

383
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,039
I need it.

384
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,839
This one?

385
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:02,799
I'm back.

386
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:04,359
How is she?

387
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:06,880
She should be fine.

388
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:08,519
How is Madam Ke Xin?

389
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,839
I couldn't tell her.

390
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:16,160
By the way, Xia,

391
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,520
do you know how to use a hairpin?

392
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:18,960
Let me try.

393
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,599
Don't use this hairpin.

394
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:35,880
This can't be used.

395
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:41,920
Xia.

396
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,590
Stay here and keep Madam Ke Xin company.

397
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,440
Li Zhi and I are going
to Mr. Na Wa's place.

398
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,759
Got it. Be careful.

399
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,720
We're going now.

400
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,160
Siyuan, come check this out.

401
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:52,920
Surveillance cameras?

402
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:55,319
Guilty conscience much?

403
00:24:58,799 --> 00:24:59,400
Careful!

404
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:03,240
Run!

405
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:08,680
Oh, no.

406
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:34,200
Release him.

407
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:41,760
We have witnesses and solid evidence.

408
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,680
Do you have anything
to say for yourself?

409
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:52,559
Yes. I shot Su Pa with a crossbow.

410
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,759
Didn't expect her to survive.

411
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,720
You killed Tai Shu too, didn't you?

412
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,519
Well,

413
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,480
you're not taking me back
to the station first?

414
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,500
Just making conversation.

415
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:18,200
You want me to say it
for Siyuan's sake, don't you?

416
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,880
You're overthinking it.

417
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,590
I just want to know,
why did you kill Tai Shu?

418
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:27,279
He was your brother.

419
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:34,599
Having a good older brother

420
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,240
must feel nice, huh, Siyuan?

421
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:45,799
I used to envy you and your brother.

422
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:50,200
Yes,

423
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:53,000
Tai Shu

424
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,720
was my brother.

425
00:26:58,079 --> 00:26:59,440
But sometimes,

426
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,839
I wish he wasn't a complete jerk,

427
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:06,799
just my brother...

428
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,680
Get me the money.

429
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:13,960
No.

430
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:16,119
I saved that money
for Mom's eye treatment.

431
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:17,960
She's old! How many years does

432
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,039
she even have left?

433
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:20,559
What's the point?

434
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,400
How could you say something like that?

435
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,759
Do you want to live long enough

436
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,880
to take care of her funeral?

437
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,440
Yes, yes.

438
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,960
Tai Shu...

439
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,119
Tai Shu...

440
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,279
Na Wa earned that money

441
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:32,599
through his own hard work.

442
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:34,480
It's his money.

443
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,519
Let him go.

444
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:36,759
- Let him go.
- Go away!

445
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:37,680
Mom!

446
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,599
Oh, so he's your son,

447
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,640
but I'm not?

448
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:40,599
Get me the money!

449
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:42,839
Okay! Okay!

450
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:53,759
I'll give you the money.

451
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,559
But if I do,

452
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,000
promise me you'll never
come back to this house again.

453
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,400
Just give it to me!

454
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,599
Mom.

455
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,240
Na Wa,

456
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:05,519
we're family.

457
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,400
And family

458
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,480
should stay together.

459
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:24,040
No need to go all the way
back to your childhood.

460
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:24,920
I just want to know,

461
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,039
why did you kill Tai Shu and Jie En?

462
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,000
Was it because of Ke Xin?

463
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:33,480
Yes.

464
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,079
I love her.

465
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,680
I'm the only person

466
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,359
who really loves her.

467
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,559
Does it hurt?

468
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,519
Stop pretending.

469
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,240
It's just your arm. You'll live.

470
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,599
Now hand over your keys.

471
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,799
Give them to me.

472
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,700
I bought the car with borrowed money.

473
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,240
I need it to pay off my debts.

474
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,039
What does a mango seller

475
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:03,200
need a car for?

476
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,510
Just get yourself a tricycle.

477
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,520
Now give me the keys!

478
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,420
No. I haven't even
finished my deliveries.

479
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,440
Looks like it doesn't hurt that much.

480
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:10,920
Tai Shu...

481
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,680
What are you doing?

482
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,920
You wench!

483
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,860
None of your business.

484
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:39,660
Stay out of this.

485
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,119
Leave now, or I'll call the police.

486
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,519
Here.

487
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,400
You're fine.

488
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:23,720
You're bleeding.

489
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,720
Wait here.

490
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:46,359
The villagers said

491
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,790
she always sat by the window
brushing her hair on purpose.

492
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:52,700
They said that she was a lonely widow
who couldn't stand being alone,

493
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,680
trying to seduce men.

494
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,880
And some of them

495
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,519
actually started thinking
about acting on it.

496
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,559
I longed for her.

497
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,759
I wanted to have her,

498
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,240
to protect her.

499
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:33,920
I wanted her to belong

500
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,559
only to me.

501
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,200
This is good stuff.

502
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,110
Give me back my camera!

503
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:56,200
Screw you!

504
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,039
Just tell me, was it fun?

505
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,200
Did you screw her?

506
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:05,279
You're sick!

507
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,110
You don't have to tell me.

508
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:10,279
I'll try it myself.

509
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:11,759
Don't you dare!

510
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:15,279
Why won't I?

511
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:17,279
I'll take off her clothes,

512
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:19,640
and then her pants.

513
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,920
No one can stop me.

514
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,759
No one can stop me!

515
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,160
From now on,

516
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,160
I'm god.

517
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,079
She belongs only to me.

518
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,359
Even if she is insane,

519
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,119
she is still mine only.

520
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,680
What do you take Ke Xin for?

521
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,839
A pet?

522
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,759
You keep saying you love her,

523
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,360
but what have you
actually done for her?

524
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,300
Is this so-called love
even what she wants?

525
00:33:56,359 --> 00:33:58,480
After everything I've done for her,

526
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:00,880
how is it not love?

527
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,039
That's not love.

528
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,679
That's control and possession!

529
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:31,880
Sure,

530
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,079
you protected her at times,

531
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,239
but only to satisfy

532
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,400
your own twisted desires.

533
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,400
If you had even a shred
of genuine love for her,

534
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,860
Su Pa wouldn't be lying
in a hospital right now.

535
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,440
That's on you, Liao Siyuan!

536
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,920
If you hadn't insisted
on digging into this case,

537
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,600
everything would've stayed the same.

538
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,039
We could've lived peacefully

539
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,040
under the River Spirit's blessing!

540
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,360
Don't try to shift the blame.

541
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:03,200
You have to face the consequences
of your murders.

542
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:10,480
Where did you get this photo?

543
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:15,119
This?

544
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,000
I took it.

545
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:18,079
You took it?

546
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:21,639
That night was Water Lantern Festival.

547
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,800
I was planning to take
some pictures of Ke Xin,

548
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:27,079
but I accidentally captured this.

549
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,559
Dad!

550
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:39,920
Mom!

551
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,599
Zhibai!

552
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:43,840
Si...

553
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,920
I started this fire.

554
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:02,840
Perfect, isn't it?

555
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,520
Like the most beautiful fireworks,

556
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,639
right?

557
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,559
What else did you see?

558
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,639
Pretty much what you see in the photo.

559
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,159
That blurry figure in the background?

560
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,840
I couldn't make them out either.

561
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:42,840
Because it had nothing to do with me.

562
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,280
Then why was this photo
in Nu Na's possession?

563
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,110
She was loaded.

564
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:49,760
I used the photo to threaten her.

565
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:52,119
Turns out, she was very generous.

566
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,679
She paid me quite a bit.

567
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:00,360
You think I'm despicable, don't you?

568
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,760
Well, let me tell you, Siyuan,

569
00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:04,440
this is who I am.
