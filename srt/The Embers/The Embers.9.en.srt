1
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:13,430
Stop asking questions.

2
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:15,240
Just give me the money.

3
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:18,160
(2011, Meet Bar backstreet)
I've already given you some a few days ago.

4
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,359
I don't have any now.

5
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,519
Why can't you understand that?

6
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:24,320
The goods I'm delivering right now

7
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:25,519
will be paid for soon.

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,879
Once they're sold,

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,239
we'll have money.

10
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:29,079
So what?

11
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,559
You say that so confidently every time,

12
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,100
but you blow it on booze and gambling

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,110
whenever you get money.

14
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,800
Have you ever sent a single dime home?

15
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,709
No more dreaming!

16
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:37,780
I won't give you anything!

17
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,880
You're not doing me this favor, huh?

18
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:42,040
I'm telling you, when I get rich,

19
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,660
the first thing I'll do is divorce you!

20
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:44,840
You wench!

21
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,039
Divorce her right now if you can.

22
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:50,960
You wretched woman.

23
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,439
How dare you hit me?

24
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,920
My head hurts.

25
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,439
I must have a concussion.

26
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,159
You have to pay me.

27
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,800
Listen, I'll call the police
if you don't pay me.

28
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:14,280
Pay me money.

29
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:17,680
I'm dizzy.

30
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:25,680
Get lost.

31
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:27,920
Take the money and scram.

32
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,079
You have no shame.

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,640
Dear,

34
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:44,159
I'll wait for you outside after work.

35
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:51,760
Dear.

36
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,319
I'm not going with you.

37
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,079
You think

38
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,719
that woman will keep protecting you?

39
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,079
You know what?

40
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:02,519
She can't even protect herself

41
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:03,480
right now.

42
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:06,719
What do you mean?

43
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,919
You're too nosy.

44
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,159
Beat her.

45
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,400
See for yourself.

46
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,940
Are you out of your mind?

Don't move. We're the police.

66
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:02,480
Yes,

67
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:04,759
I used to be an escort.

68
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,160
But I made my money with my own hands.

69
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,759
What's the problem with that?

70
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:15,560
Of course,

71
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:17,800
I couldn't let

72
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,270
my business partners

73
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:21,560
know this.

74
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,040
That's why they blackmailed me.

75
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,480
You're doing a roaring business.

76
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,759
If those

77
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,480
who collaborate with you

78
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,680
found out about your past,

79
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,240
would they be surprised?

80
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:47,480
What do you want?

81
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,040
Enough.

82
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,360
You've scared her.

83
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,000
We're good friends.

84
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:55,879
It was just a joke.

85
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,430
Don't take it seriously.

86
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:00,279
Of course, we were joking.

87
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,420
How could we possibly

88
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,680
do this to you?

89
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:06,120
You're the only one among us

90
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,800
who lives to the fullest.

91
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:13,519
Honestly, they were all pretty pathetic.

92
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,120
Nu Na

93
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,839
was someone's mistress.

94
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,279
Now, her husband is

95
00:07:23,059 --> 00:07:24,340
cheating again,

96
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:27,000
and the bridal shop is going under.

97
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,160
It's good that she died.

98
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,839
That's better.

99
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,800
At least she didn't have
to get kicked out.

100
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,600
Who knows

101
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:41,399
if she would end up
working as an escort again?

102
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,240
Man Ni...

103
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:52,160
Her life may have seemed glamorous
to you,

104
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,360
but she was broke.

105
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,519
Her agency treated her

106
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:58,399
like a slave.

107
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,079
They often made her

108
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:02,800
entertain investors.

109
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,310
She wanted to break her contract
long ago,

110
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,480
but the penalty was too steep.

111
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,839
As for Lin, needless to say,

112
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:12,480
she had it the worst.

113
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,639
So you withdrew a large sum of cash

114
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,000
for the deal with them?

115
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:25,480
They blackmailed me.

116
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:29,279
Since you had the money ready,

117
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:32,240
why did you kill them?

118
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:34,279
Officer.

119
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,600
You should know better than me.

120
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,720
Greed.

121
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:43,279
Greed is a bottomless pit.

122
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,520
If they get what they want
the first time,

123
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,520
there will be a second,

124
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:48,480
a third, and a fourth.

125
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,159
I was foolish to think
they were my friends.

126
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,720
I thought

127
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,440
they just wanted to catch up.

128
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:11,679
Well, it's over now.

129
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,759
They're all dead.

130
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,440
No one can threaten me anymore.

131
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:19,440
So you admit to killing them?

132
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:24,720
I didn't confess anything.

133
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:28,840
My lawyer has contacted the embassy.

134
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:30,559
You don't have proof.

135
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,840
You can't do anything to me.

136
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,840
Says who?

137
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,519
We found this at your place.

138
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,240
AH7.

139
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,200
Qi Xia,

140
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,120
it's found inside the gramophone.

141
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,440
I have the right to remain silent.

142
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,519
I want to call my lawyer.

143
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,440
Give her the phone.

144
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,679
Dial

145
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:30,399
and put it on speaker.

146
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,759
Mr. Wu.

147
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:45,480
I'm Xu Man.

148
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:47,600
Don't worry, Ms. Xu.

149
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:49,159
It's all arranged.

150
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,799
The AH7 we found at Xu Man's place

151
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,559
is key evidence in the murder case.

152
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,600
Did she say

153
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,240
where it came from?

154
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:15,080
No.

155
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,080
She refused to admit it was hers.

156
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:19,080
Then she just went silent

157
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,240
and waited for her lawyer.

158
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,639
I thought we could follow this lead

159
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:25,240
back to the case from ten years ago.

160
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,720
Looks like we'll have to start over.

161
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,240
There's no clue now, anyway.

162
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,879
Don't let it bother you.

163
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:41,399
Get rest early

164
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:43,039
and prepare for tomorrow's wedding.

165
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:44,960
All right.

166
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,792
(Qi's Pharmacy, Healing hands
as warm as the spring breeze.)

167
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:00,960
Suspicion cleared.

168
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,120
We're finally

169
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,879
out of the cops' watch.

170
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,440
They may not see me,

171
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,559
but I've seen them every day.

172
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,360
They're such a nuisance, you know?

173
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:12,840
Tomorrow, I'll go visit

174
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,000
Madam An Ni.

175
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,600
No problem. I'll go with you.

176
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,240
What's wrong?

177
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,840
The case is cracked.

178
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,320
Why do you still look troubled?

179
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:26,879
I don't get why

180
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,480
Nu Na gave money to Man Ni

181
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,840
and Lin.

182
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
If those two blackmailed Xu Man,

183
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,039
they could do the same thing
to Nu Na as well.

184
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,519
They just wanted money.

185
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:38,480
Anyone would do.

186
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:41,759
Then why didn't Xu Man escape

187
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:43,320
immediately after killing?

188
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,639
Also,

189
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,039
why did she take me to the food stall?

190
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,040
I have a feeling she was revealing

191
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,440
something to me on purpose.

192
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:52,639
Say,

193
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,080
genius detectives like you people

194
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,320
always overthink

195
00:12:57,399 --> 00:12:58,519
and act weirdly.

196
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:00,240
If you don't say

197
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,559
"It's little more than that",

198
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,440
you can't show

199
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,799
how much of a genius you are.

200
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,920
You'll snap out of it
when you become more experienced.

201
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:13,360
But...

202
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:17,480
Xia.

203
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,240
Did you get hurt?

204
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:22,639
I'm good.

205
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:25,600
Sit over there.

206
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:27,360
I'm good.

207
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:31,960
How much did you drink?

208
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:33,759
I'm not drunk.

209
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,320
Here, drink some water.

210
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,240
I've never seen her like this.

211
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:43,440
Me neither.

212
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,679
Who are you talking to?

213
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,159
I...

214
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,670
wasn't saying anything.

215
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,480
Were you

216
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:05,559
talking to him?

217
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,559
I didn't say anything.

218
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,759
You're drunk.

219
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,919
Actually,

220
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,720
you've been able to see him,

221
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:15,200
haven't you?

222
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:17,200
See who?

223
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,200
I can't see anyone.

224
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:26,320
Siyuan.

225
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:31,759
If you can see him,

226
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,000
tell him

227
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,080
I'm getting married tomorrow.

228
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,039
Xia, you're drunk.

229
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,670
Let me help you to your room.

230
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,600
I'm not drunk.

231
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,559
I just drank a little.

232
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:02,440
Let me tell you a secret.

233
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,519
At first,

234
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:15,799
I didn't like Zhibai at all.

235
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,820
I was afraid of the dark

236
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,870
when I was a kid.

237
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,360
Then...

238
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,240
You're amazing.

239
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,679
You're always so fierce,

240
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,360
but you sure have a way to deal
with this little tyke.

241
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,740
Back then, I was afraid of the dark
and didn't dare to sleep.

242
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:39,200
My mom would sing this to me.

243
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,559
Perhaps he's afraid

244
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,360
because his mom isn't here.

245
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,720
You're afraid of the dark?

246
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:49,960
Any problem with that?

247
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,120
No, that's not what I mean.

248
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:55,480
I just remember something.

249
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,840
The short distance outside school

250
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,480
is very dark

251
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:01,799
at night.

252
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,240
From now on,

253
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,620
I'll wait for you to walk together
after school.

254
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:13,000
Every day after school,

255
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,200
he'd be waiting for me.

256
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,120
Every time I left school,

257
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,000
I'd see him

258
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,440
standing in the dark.

259
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,320
I felt like he had a light on him.

260
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,679
At that time,

261
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,080
I thought

262
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:47,960
if I could

263
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,919
be with him forever,

264
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,519
I'd never be afraid again.

265
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,400
What's this?

266
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,319
A wish ticket.

267
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
If you have any wishes in the future,

268
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,880
I'll fulfill them

269
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,039
as long as I'm capable.

270
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,720
I want

271
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:19,839
you

272
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,640
to marry me.

273
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:24,039
I'm not marrying you.

274
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,680
Trying to buy me off with this?

275
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:29,319
Do you like it?

276
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,759
I'll give you

277
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,079
a whole garden of poppies.

278
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:35,319
Right here.

279
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:37,279
When we get married,

280
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,720
I'll buy this for you.

281
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,920
I promised

282
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:57,720
I'd wear a wedding gown for him.

283
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,880
But he won't see that anymore.

284
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:08,880
Please come to my wedding tomorrow.

285
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,920
Over the years,

286
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:42,920
I've always hoped

287
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,680
she could forget me.

288
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:48,680
However,

289
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:52,359
I'm also afraid she forgets me.

290
00:18:56,519 --> 00:18:57,759
Ten years have passed.

291
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:01,359
I didn't expect my wish back then

292
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,400
to become a shackle to her.

293
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:08,880
She owes no one.

294
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,720
She deserves a happy life.

295
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,680
Liao Zhibai, the philosopher.

296
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,110
If I hadn't messed up the evidence
last time,

297
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,480
you wouldn't have been detained
for so long.

298
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,559
Today, I specially came here
to apologize to you.

299
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:43,759
There's no need, young man.

300
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:45,240
Don't dwell on it.

301
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,040
Please have a seat.

302
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,759
You look sharp today.

303
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:55,720
Where are you going?

304
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,200
My sister's wedding.

305
00:19:58,599 --> 00:19:59,519
It's nearby.

306
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:00,759
Wedding?

307
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:01,359
Right.

308
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:04,000
How nice.

309
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:08,680
The right two people
get together at last.

310
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,640
That's great.

311
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,839
I wonder when my son will

312
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:19,240
find the right person.

313
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,480
By the way,

314
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,100
would you like something to drink?

315
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,000
I smell coffee.

316
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:32,920
May I have a cup of it?

317
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,960
I'm sorry.

318
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,759
It's finished.

319
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,519
How about I get you

320
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:42,240
the juice you had last time?

321
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,000
Sure.

322
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,640
Give me a second.

323
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:48,920
Siyuan,

324
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,720
she's lying.

325
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,559
Look behind the frame.

326
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:05,880
She has coffee here.

327
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,640
Why did she lie?

328
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:09,599
Excuse me, sir.

329
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:10,590
Here's your coffee.

330
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,000
I'm truly sorry.

331
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,519
Is she hiding something?

332
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,119
Check her room.

333
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,160
Androgen?

334
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:49,920
An old woman

335
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:51,640
and a grown son.

336
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:53,599
Why do they need this?

337
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,590
You said she came to this cafe

338
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:02,880
at midnight last night?

339
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,519
She only ordered a cup of coffee

340
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:05,720
and filled out a questionnaire.

341
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:07,440
It's a man.

342
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,160
The age should be

343
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,660
around 28 to 35.

344
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,800
He was independent from a young age
and an introvert.

345
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,480
He must've had
serious emotional conflicts

346
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,000
with Nu Na and Man Ni.

347
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:15,680
The pendant!

348
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,240
We got it wrong.

349
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:18,440
The name on the pendant

350
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,960
should be the recipient's,

351
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,640
not the giver's.

352
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,680
This is the entire truth

353
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:29,000
behind the case.

354
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:01,240
Where's Shu He?

355
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,519
I need to see him.

356
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,920
The best man must be with the groom.

357
00:23:59,160 --> 00:23:59,839
Groom.

358
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:01,559
Bride.

359
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,359
Will you take this oath

360
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:06,640
in the name of God?

361
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:08,480
From this day forward,

362
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:11,799
for poorer or richer,
in health and in sickness,

363
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:14,799
will you love, care for,

364
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,559
respect, accept,

365
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:20,640
and stay faithful to her

366
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,559
until the end of your lives?

367
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,160
I will.

368
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,759
I...

369
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:30,640
She won't.

370
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,640
What's wrong?

371
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:46,759
It's nothing.

372
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,400
Let's continue.

373
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,599
Bride, will you take this oath

374
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,359
in the name of God?

375
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,839
Will you love, care for,

376
00:24:59,319 --> 00:24:59,960
respect...

377
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,599
Xia.

378
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:27,160
Terror attack! Get down!

379
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,480
Is... Is it you?

380
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,279
The terrorists count:

381
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,960
Two captured and two gunned down.

382
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,440
The drill is over.

383
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:03,799
Xia, wait for me here.

384
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:17,319
Now, I declare

385
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:19,119
the counterterrorism drill

386
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,160
has been completed successfully.

387
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:23,160
Good job, everyone!

388
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:27,480
Also,

389
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,480
I'd like to announce the good news.

390
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,839
Our dear colleague,

391
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:33,680
Luo Si.

392
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,559
Please come up.

393
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,839
Mr. Luo Si is

394
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,400
officially retiring

395
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,960
after this mission

396
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,640
with us.

397
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:44,200
Mr. Luo Si has

398
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,319
served for 35 years

399
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,519
and handled over 900 cases

400
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,319
without a single mistake.

401
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:54,079
He's indeed a role model for all of us.

402
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,200
Let's all give him

403
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,079
a big round of applause.

404
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:02,960
Also,

405
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,839
the serial wedding gown murder case

406
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:06,960
was solved a few days ago.

407
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,660
We haven't had a chance
to celebrate yet.

408
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:09,830
Tonight,

409
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,000
drinks are on me.

410
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,039
Let's have a blast.

411
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:15,440
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

412
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:16,160
Right.

413
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,519
All right, let's wrap up

414
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,400
and head back.

415
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:19,000
Let's go.

416
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,070
You must drink

417
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:21,119
to your heart's content.

418
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:22,279
Sure.

419
00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:23,000
Shu He.

420
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,440
What's the matter?

421
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:36,160
Do you really think

422
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,599
the serial killer

423
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:38,960
has been found?

424
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,279
What?

425
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,440
Wait.

426
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,180
Didn't you see that we arrested Xu Man

427
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,520
with your own eyes?

428
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:47,319
I have a truth

429
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:49,160
you might not be able to accept,

430
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,839
but it's the truth.

431
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:52,599
What's it?

432
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,519
Why didn't Xu Man leave Buhe

433
00:29:57,559 --> 00:29:59,359
immediately after killing Lin?

434
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:01,759
Instead, she returned to the scene

435
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,880
when we found the body.

436
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:04,680
Someone as careful as she

437
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:07,000
actually wore strong perfume

438
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,960
when entering and leaving
the murder scene.

439
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:10,680
I remember

440
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:13,279
that I noticed the perfumes

441
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,300
on her dressing table,
which she usually wears,

442
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:17,119
were all light scents.

443
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,680
But that day, at the scene,

444
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,880
and later when she met us,

445
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:23,599
she wore a strong perfume.

446
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,680
Orlando's Wish.

447
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:27,319
Obviously,

448
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,440
she did it on purpose.

449
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,039
Could it be possible

450
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:32,400
she wore that perfume on a whim
that day?

451
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:34,880
A cautious murderer

452
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,640
can make mistakes sometimes, right?

453
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:38,359
Fine.

454
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:40,799
So, with all her caution,

455
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,920
knowing that I was pretending
to be her driver

456
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,359
and was secretly in contact
with the police,

457
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,599
why did she keep letting me off?

458
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,460
Her fingers are smooth,
with no calluses.

459
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,960
She doesn't know how to shoot,

460
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,440
nor does she need to shoot.

461
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,680
But she still fired the gun,
which was pointless,

462
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,640
in front of you.

463
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,480
And the wedding gown.

464
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,839
They may look very similar.

465
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,200
But it's different

466
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,180
from the missing piece

467
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,000
from Nu Na's bridal shop.

468
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,119
One has Leaver lace at the collar,

469
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,440
while the other has Alençon lace.

470
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:16,359
Are you suggesting

471
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,079
that Xu Man deliberately revealed
the evidence to us?

472
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,279
Right.

473
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,980
So you've found the real murderer,
haven't you?

474
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,200
An Ni's son,

475
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,000
Pei Ji.

476
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:35,759
That's impossible.

477
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,589
We've looked into Pei Ji before.

478
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:38,780
Chief, I told you this before.

479
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,240
Apart from the truth
that he doesn't have a blood relation

480
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,020
with An Ni,

481
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,680
there's no problem with him.

482
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,960
Is that so?

483
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:49,559
Well, I wouldn't say

484
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:50,749
there's absolutely no problem.

485
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,540
When I was interviewing their neighbors,

486
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:55,359
they told me Pei Ji had been
to prison before.

487
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:57,359
But when I checked the prison system,

488
00:31:57,359 --> 00:31:58,559
there were no records of him.

489
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,240
Perhaps he didn't do anything bad.

490
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,839
It's just the neighbor's gossiping,

491
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:04,440
right?

492
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,480
You couldn't find anything

493
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,400
because you checked
the male prison system.

494
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,680
Shouldn't I...

495
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,830
I found this in An Ni's place.

496
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:18,359
Her son might actually be a woman,

497
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,580
which is why you couldn't find anything
in the male prison system.

498
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,400
Jing turned off the camera
in the bridal shop.

499
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:25,880
That means the murderer

500
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:27,920
never intended to avoid it.

501
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:30,200
From the beginning,

502
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:32,799
he wanted to mislead everyone

503
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,160
into thinking the murderer was a woman.

504
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
That's just your speculation.

505
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:43,920
Do you have any proof?

506
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,039
Go to An Ni's place
to get Pei Ji's DNA sample.

507
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,119
Compare it with the suspect's DNA

508
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:51,759
found under Man Ni's fingernail.

509
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,319
Yes, Chief.

510
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:54,400
Go now.

511
00:32:57,839 --> 00:32:59,000
One thing I can't work out.

512
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,599
Xu Man is rich and has connections.

513
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,480
Why would she take the blame for Pei Ji,

514
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,020
especially a capital crime?

515
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:09,920
It's because Pei Ji

516
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:12,759
is the real Xu Man,

517
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,640
while the current Xu Man

518
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,279
used to have another name.

519
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,200
Lan Xiaotang.

520
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:22,920
Well,

521
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,310
it's pretty good to consider today

522
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:25,500
as your birthday, isn't it?

523
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,660
Won't you congratulate me?

524
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:29,039
I'm no longer the previous me.

525
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,279
She'll never be the person
she once was, either.

526
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,240
Time freezes
in the most beautiful memories.

527
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,119
Perhaps this is for the best.

528
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:37,119
We got it wrong.

529
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,070
The name of the pendant

530
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:39,559
should be the recipient's.

531
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,920
The pendant you're wearing is unique.

532
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,680
Did Lan Xiaotang give you this?

533
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,400
Yes, it's from Lan Xiaotang.

534
00:33:47,117 --> 00:33:49,660
(Lan Xiaotang, Xu Man)

535
00:33:50,797 --> 00:33:52,860
(Lan Xiaotang, Xu Man)

536
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:56,119
By the way,

537
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,079
the celebration

538
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,720
is at the police station, right?

539
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:08,400
I'll tell you the rest

540
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,400
at the police station later.

541
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:28,400
We're the police. Open the door!

542
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:32,840
Open the door!

543
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,119
Hurry!

544
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:52,880
Officer, it's you again.

545
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:57,400
Start now.

546
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:13,960
Sir,

547
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,920
there are no fingerprints anywhere
in the house.

548
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,100
They've probably been cleaned.

549
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,470
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

550
00:35:23,719 --> 00:35:25,559
I knew I hadn't caught the wrong person.

551
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:27,199
You're in it with them.

552
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:29,239
Officer,

553
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,039
I don't know what you're talking about.

554
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,679
I was just cleaning.

555
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:35,960
Cleaning?

556
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:38,549
Don't try to fool me.

557
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:41,100
There's no way a living person
could leave no trace at all.

558
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,840
(Here's a bank card for you.)

559
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:06,239
(Thank you, An Ni.)

560
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:08,079
Wrap it up.

561
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:51,079
Dear Luo Si.

562
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:51,550
Director.

563
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:52,760
Why are you still here?

564
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,239
You don't have to get involved
in any more cases.

565
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,559
Just go home and enjoy your retirement.

566
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:01,079
If so, I won't be staying late
with everyone.

567
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:01,960
Go ahead.

568
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,100
Let's have a meal together another time.

569
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:04,600
Sure.

570
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,199
Mr. Luo Si.

571
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:13,500
Please wait a moment.

572
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,510
What's the matter?

573
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,719
I have some questions for you.

574
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:22,079
Twelve years ago,

575
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:25,740
Lan Xiaotang was involved
in a drunk driving vehicular homicide.

576
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,070
You handled the case, didn't you?

577
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,880
I read the case file.

578
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:33,199
A lot of details are missing.

579
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,320
Since you're here,

580
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:35,940
I'd like to ask you about it.

581
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:37,760
Go on.

582
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,920
He's already retired.

583
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,190
All his work has been fully handed over.

584
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:45,000
If you have any questions,

585
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:46,100
we can answer them.

586
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,550
There's no need to take up his time.

587
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:48,199
Luo Si,

588
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,920
go pick up your grandchild.

589
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,159
You should go.

590
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:53,480
First question.

591
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,540
Why did the road surveillance footage
from back then

592
00:37:57,679 --> 00:37:59,079
disappear without reason?

593
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,760
Second question.

594
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:03,000
Was there anyone else in the car?

595
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,920
Third question.

596
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,679
Was this

597
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:09,559
an accident, or was it intentional?

598
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,480
Final question.

599
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,199
What's your relationship

600
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,320
with Ms. Lin?

601
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,280
Why does her phone

602
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,079
contain a compromising video of you?

603
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:22,800
No way.

604
00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:25,000
We only slept together once.

605
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,360
That was years ago.

606
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:27,840
We didn't film anything...

607
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,880
Actually, I never saw anything.

608
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:39,679
When I checked

609
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:41,000
Lin's call history,

610
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,920
I happened to see your name.

611
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,559
I was bluffing.

612
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:51,639
I didn't expect you to act so guilty.

613
00:38:56,679 --> 00:38:57,800
He... He's talking nonsense.

614
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,159
I didn't.

615
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:02,320
Take him away.

616
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,119
Let me explain, Director.

617
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,440
Hear me out.

618
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,639
All right.

619
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:15,880
Director,

620
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,280
we've obtained the DNA sample.

621
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:19,040
The results will be out
as soon as tonight.

622
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,360
Arrest her.

623
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,960
Lan Xiaotang has already arranged
a boat

624
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,079
for her escape from Buhe.

625
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:25,900
If everything goes as planned,

626
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,760
she should be on the high seas by now.

627
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:32,440
Mr. Wu.

628
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:36,119
I'm Xu Man.

629
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:38,360
Don't worry, Ms. Xu.

630
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:39,679
It's all arranged.

631
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,780
The answers on the questionnaire
were actually

632
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,440
the departure time they agreed on.

633
00:39:48,139 --> 00:39:49,430
(20190604)

634
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:50,800
Yes.

635
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,159
But she's still here.

636
00:39:57,559 --> 00:39:58,719
She'll definitely come back.

637
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:39,960
I'm Xu Man.

638
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,559
Suspect, Pei Ji.

639
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Formerly known as Xu Man.

640
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,840
