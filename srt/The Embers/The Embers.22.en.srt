1
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:14,080
Seriously?

2
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,340
(May 17, 2014, Buhe City Police Academy)
We just let Shu He leave like this?

3
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:19,640
What if he reports us?

4
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:21,160
Things were done.

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,559
Why? Are you panicked, Fatty?

6
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,399
Who are you calling "Fatty"?

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,600
I dare you to say this in front of me.

8
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,140
Come on. Say that in front of him.

9
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:30,220
Your legs are numb.

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,510
Like yours aren't numb.

11
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:32,920
You ran the fastest just now.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,719
I wasn't warmed up yet.

13
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,439
You think you speak very smoothly?

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,159
Lang Sang.

15
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:42,560
Did you guys go to see Shu He?

16
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,520
Nothing happened. Don't worry.

17
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,940
We talked everything out.
It's a misunderstanding.

18
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:49,680
Good to hear that.

19
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,039
I know

20
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:58,200
you guys are worried about me.

21
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,399
But there are things

22
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,200
I can't blame others.

23
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,040
I told you earlier.

24
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,360
I'm not cut out to be a police.

25
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,920
- Don't say that.
- Don't say that.

26
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,920
Don't sell yourself short.

27
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:13,040
Don't beat yourself up.

28
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,840
I know you guys are kind to me.

29
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:18,359
Well, enough about this.

30
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,719
I have good news to share with you.

31
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:23,380
What good news do you have
when you're already so unlucky?

32
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,200
I've always wanted
to open a little store.

33
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,519
I went to look for places
a few days ago.

34
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,959
It was one street away from our academy.

35
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:34,640
Affordable rent.

36
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,200
Good location.

37
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,700
I've been saving up from part-time jobs
for the past two years,

38
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:42,799
so I rent the place.

39
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,760
That's nice.

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,060
You're going to be a boss.

41
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,480
Congrats.

42
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,560
- Congrats.
- Yeah.

43
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,480
- Congrats.
- Good luck with your business.

44
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,079
Congrats.

45
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,480
Guys, let's meet at Good Luck Restaurant
tonight. My treat.

46
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,260
Let's celebrate Lang Sang's
grand opening.

47
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,519
All right.

48
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,439
That sounds good.

49
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,860
- Can we order anything we like?
- Thank you, Boss Bai.

50
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,680
Thank you, Boss Bai.

51
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,519
Thank you, boss.

52
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:04,159
Don't mention it.

53
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:07,000
My shop is under renovation.

54
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:08,560
I'll be there late.

55
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,319
All right. Don't be too late.

56
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,280
We'll wait for you.

57
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,599
Let's go, buddies.

58
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,919
- Come.
- Let's go.

59
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:15,680
Congrats, boss.

60
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,680
Fatty, are your legs still numb?

61
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,680
Free meal.

62
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,620
Don't eat so much.

63
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,879
You're a cop?

64
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:47,960
Sorry.

65
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:10,800
I, cadet Lang Sang,

66
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:15,240
Class 1 of 2004, Police Academy,

67
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:18,080
demand that you

68
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:20,120
stop your actions.

69
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:27,759
Louder.

70
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,280
I, cadet Lang Sang,

71
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,319
demand that you

72
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:36,919
stop your actions.

73
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,840
I, Lang Sang, demand that you

74
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,280
stop your actions.

75
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:59,759
I apologized.

76
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:44,600
Dad.

77
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,040
Pick up.

78
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:49,199
Pick up...

79
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,439
Come on.

80
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:55,160
Dad,

81
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,120
I killed someone.

82
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:05,920
I think he was

83
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,319
a cop.

84
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,079
Starts now.

85
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:18,622
=The Embers=

86
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,510
=Episode 22=

87
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:26,399
This is Ti Yi's real information.

88
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:28,519
She's Shen Congxin,

89
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,399
Ti Yi's mother.

90
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,319
Gai De?

91
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,879
He was with you

92
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,380
when the incident happened, right?

93
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,040
Yes.

94
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,300
I don't think you should go in.

95
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,960
It's weird that he asked to meet
at his place for the first time.

96
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,560
Don't you think it's too easy?

97
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:51,000
Too easy?

98
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,240
Ever since I decided
to look into this case,

99
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,160
every single lead

100
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,439
has been way too spot on.

101
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,740
It's just a matter of time
to find the truth.

102
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,199
I always have a feeling

103
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,319
that someone is guiding me.

104
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,720
Has it been you?

105
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:11,399
Liao Zhibai set everything up.

106
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,319
Help me.

107
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,360
Liao Siyuan,

108
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,460
which do you think is more important?

109
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:19,439
The truth or punishing bad guys?

110
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,360
Everything is his plan.

111
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:27,240
Shen Congxin's in danger.

112
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,200
Gai De,

113
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,200
I'm Shen Congxin.

114
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,919
Let's make a deal

115
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:52,000
and put an end to all of this.

116
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:53,840
What deal?

117
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,200
I'll wait for you
at the Zhenmei's rooftop.

118
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,200
I don't mind telling you this.

119
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,519
I've never left my hometown
in my whole life.

120
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:25,840
The first time I went to Buhe

121
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:30,799
was when I was called

122
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,519
to identify Yi's body.

123
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:12,840
Why was she injured so badly?

124
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:17,879
Who did this?

125
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:21,559
Who did this?

126
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:23,720
Yi.

127
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,000
Get up. Let's go home.

128
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,399
Get up now, Yi.

129
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,960
Yi, let's leave.

130
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,519
Let's go home. Come on.

131
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:32,440
Come on.

132
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:34,080
Yi.

133
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:35,919
She would never sell herself.

134
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:38,200
My daughter would never do such a thing.

135
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,720
You've got the wrong person.

136
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:45,720
Yi.

137
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,000
It's a mistake.

138
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:05,399
I'll calm down.

139
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,960
I'll calm down.

140
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,799
So pretty.

141
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,200
So pretty.

142
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:13,759
Officer,

143
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,039
I have a request.

144
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:06,240
Siyuan's calling me.

145
00:13:07,063 --> 00:13:08,120
(Siyuan)

146
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,320
But the person he wants to speak with
isn't me.

147
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,679
Don't trust the man beside you.

148
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:17,000
He's using you.

149
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,560
He did all this for his own purposes.

150
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:20,720
Do you remember me?

151
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,180
I'm Liao Siyuan. We've met before.

152
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,200
I can help you.

153
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,759
Where are you now?

154
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:28,559
Think about Ti Yi.

155
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:31,120
Would she want this to happen to you?

156
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:32,759
Don't you want to see

157
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:33,960
Gai De punished?

158
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,559
Must you really trade your life
with his?

159
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,080
Is a scumbag like him

160
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,279
worth your sacrifice?

161
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,480
For the sake of my daughter,

162
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:42,080
everything is worth it.

163
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,559
Just do nothing.

164
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:47,600
Do nothing and stay alive!

165
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,240
Thank you.

166
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,600
Everything he just said is true.

167
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:08,279
You still have time

168
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:09,759
to turn back.

169
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:17,799
Liao Zhibai,

170
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,360
do you know why I trust you?

171
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:23,720
You're the only one

172
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,759
who risks everything you have

173
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,200
to find the truth for her.

174
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,240
I trust you.

175
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,559
Only you.

176
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:39,200
Liao Zhibai,

177
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,639
please use me

178
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,399
as much as you have to.

179
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,799
If you jump now,

180
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,240
he'll become a murderer.

181
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,080
But once he leaves this building,

182
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:34,759
he's innocent.

183
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:05,639
Check all the surveillance footage now.

184
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:06,919
Are they off?

185
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,200
How could that be?

186
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,360
They're supposed to be off.

187
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,700
When did they turn on?

188
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,519
Check if I'm in them.

189
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,440
Yes, you are.

190
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,550
You entered the main building
a minute ago.

191
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:19,720
Delete it.

192
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,840
Sorry, the data has been sent out.

193
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,960
They set me up.

194
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:41,639
I remember

195
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:46,720
every time Yi came back
during the semester break,

196
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,080
I'd arrive early at the bus station

197
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,440
to pick her up.

198
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:06,279
Yi.

199
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:07,880
- I'm here.
- Mom.

200
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:11,119
The moment the door opened,

201
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,759
she'd run toward me

202
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:14,079
so excitedly.

203
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,079
That was the happiest moment
I had in my life.

204
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,039
My poor girl.

205
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,119
She's waited so long for me.

206
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:31,160
This time,

207
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,119
it's her turn to pick me up.

208
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,759
Thank you

209
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,280
for being with me
during my last moments.

210
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,839
This isn't a tragedy to me.

211
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:05,279
It's a reunion.

212
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,400
Liao Zhibai.

213
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:20,400
Why?

214
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:22,960
She didn't have to die.

215
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,480
It was her choice.

216
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:30,620
Did she even have a choice?

217
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:32,240
Did you give her one?

218
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:34,359
From the moment

219
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:36,240
you planned the sexual assault case,

220
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,839
did you also convince her

221
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:39,720
it would succeed?

222
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:42,160
Did you tell her your plan afterward?

223
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,440
Did you dare to?

224
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,320
I told her everything.

225
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,920
What's the point of telling her now?

226
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:48,400
Liao Zhibai,

227
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,440
people are the goal,

228
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,519
not the results.

229
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,359
She never had a choice
from the beginning.

230
00:19:56,839 --> 00:19:58,440
She could only follow your plan

231
00:19:58,519 --> 00:20:00,519
until she walked up to this rooftop.

232
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,200
Ever since you approached me,

233
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,200
you've been using me.

234
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,599
You even predicted

235
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,200
that I'd testify for Gai De,

236
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,560
which would lead to
Shen Congxin's accusation failing.

237
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,589
Also, you knew

238
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,820
Shen Congxin would be willing
to jump from this rooftop.

239
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:20,500
Right?

240
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,400
Only by her jumping

241
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:30,279
would it garner
massive public attention,

242
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,200
bring justice to Ti Yi and Lang Sang,

243
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,559
and push Gai De into a corner.

244
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,799
My efforts over the ten years

245
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:41,200
mustn't be wasted.

246
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:45,759
Your target has always been Gai De.

247
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,960
Or maybe not him.

248
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,680
That's right.

249
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:54,640
It was never about Gai De,

250
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:56,839
but the person behind him.

251
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,640
Ten years ago,

252
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,240
he helped Gai De escape punishment.

253
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,380
He was powerful enough
to control everything.

254
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:04,880
I killed someone.

255
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:07,720
I think he was

256
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:11,160
a cop.

257
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,839
I spent so much time tracking him down

258
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,200
but to no avail.

259
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:18,319
Putting Gai De
into a desperate situation

260
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,360
is the only way
to have him show himself.

261
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:21,960
That's why you used me

262
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,260
to feed the police information,

263
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,160
and used Shen Congxin
to stir public outrage

264
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,550
against Gai De.

265
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:36,000
And you used Shen Congxin's death

266
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:38,119
to paint Gai De as a murderer.

267
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:44,400
Liao Zhibai,

268
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,680
you claim you did all this
for other's sake,

269
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:48,559
but it was all for yourself.

270
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:50,359
You found their weaknesses

271
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:53,119
and lured me into your trap.

272
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,279
Gai De was never your real prey.

273
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,160
I was...

274
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:06,440
I had no choice.

275
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:07,599
You had no choice?

276
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:11,160
Liao Zhibai,

277
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,280
how many times has it been?

278
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,039
From Lai La to Pei Ji, to Nu Na,

279
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:16,680
and now her.

280
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:18,599
What did their lives mean to you?

281
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,799
A tool? A bargaining chip?

282
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:25,260
I was such a fool
to believe that you'd turn yourself in.

283
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,560
Not for a single minute or second

284
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,160
did you realize you were wrong.

285
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:30,759
You never repented.

286
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,359
They were willing

287
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:36,079
to entrust their lives to me

288
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,000
to turn them into
something meaningful they wanted.

289
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:43,640
I did nothing wrong.

290
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:45,839
I don't feel guilty at all.

291
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:53,640
Nothing is worth trading a life for.

292
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,079
You are not Liao Zhibai.

293
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:01,300
The person who's been with me
for the past ten years isn't like this.

294
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:39,000
Siyuan,

295
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,720
I envy you, really.

296
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:47,720
You can live in your fantasy.

297
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,599
If you hadn't chosen this path,

298
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,759
would everything have been different?

299
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,519
Liao Zhibai.

300
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,079
Liao Zhibai!

301
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,559
I'll catch you myself.

302
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,759
I'll wait for you.

303
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:32,680
The victim's real name is Shen Congxin.

304
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,920
She was the mother of Ti Yi
from the case ten years ago.

305
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,920
We found Gai De's footprints
at the scene,

306
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,580
and the surveillance also captured him

307
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:42,160
heading to the rooftop

308
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:43,720
before Shen Congxin jumped.

309
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,079
It fits the timeline
of when Shen Congxin jumped.

310
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:50,799
I suspect this is a planned murder.

311
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,519
Currently, Gai De has escaped.

312
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,240
We're tracking him down.

313
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,599
Wasn't Ti Yi's mother already dead?

314
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:02,559
Someone must've forged the record.

315
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:04,119
Forged the record?

316
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,640
Who?

317
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:10,319
Bai Han or Liao Zhibai?

318
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,039
Liao Zhibai?

319
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:17,839
We just got confirmation.

320
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,640
The surveillance footage at the scene

321
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:23,519
caught him there.

322
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:25,839
Don't tell me

323
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:28,559
you just found out he's still alive.

324
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:36,759
Director,

325
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,880
there are many people outside

326
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,220
claiming to make reports.

327
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,039
They're here to report Gai De
for sexual assault.

328
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,799
He assaulted me

329
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,119
in the second month
I joined the company.

330
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,160
That was also when I met Shen Congxin.

331
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,599
Hold on.

332
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,759
Can we talk?

333
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:20,160
Gai De said he was innocent.

334
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,279
It was my scent that seduced him.

335
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:26,440
He even threatened me afterward.

336
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:29,480
He said if I called the police,

337
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:33,559
he'd ruin my reputation.

338
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,200
He said he was the king of Zhenmei.

339
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,319
He could do anything he wanted

340
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:40,480
anytime, anywhere.

341
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:44,000
He tore our dress

342
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:48,200
and made us perform in front of him.

343
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,440
Shen Congxin reached out to us

344
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,319
late last year.

345
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,180
She said she had been
investigating this,

346
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,310
and she knew what we had been through.

347
00:26:56,759 --> 00:26:58,119
She begged us to help her,

348
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:00,559
but none of them dared to come forward.

349
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:03,920
Gai De never actually met Shen Congxin,

350
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:06,200
and she never officially
joined the company.

351
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,440
We faked those photos.

352
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,000
We let her show up in Zhenmei

353
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,039
just to create an illusion

354
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:16,000
that confuses people.

355
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:17,620
I came here to turn myself in.

356
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,119
These are all the personnel files.

357
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,040
You'll find out after reading them.

358
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:23,279
Two recruitments a year.

359
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,200
He not only hired
young and beautiful women,

360
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,069
but also required the interviewees

361
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,540
to write down their measurements

362
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,550
on the form.

363
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:35,400
This can't be served as proof.

364
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,760
What else do you have?

365
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,640
Didn't you realize

366
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,060
that Zhenmei's surveillance cameras
are always off?

367
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,759
That's to help him

368
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,400
to do those dirty things.

369
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,039
Master.

370
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,480
It's all right. Focus on your work.

371
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,480
I just settled the paperwork

372
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,900
and came here to fetch my things.

373
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,680
This office is yours from now on.

374
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:13,240
If you really don't want to leave,

375
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,039
you should accept the offer and stay.

376
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:15,700
No.

377
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,760
(Xu Sheng, Forensic Pathologist)
Over two decades,

378
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,310
(Xu Sheng, Forensic Pathologist)
I've been working here.

379
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:20,200
(Xu Sheng, Forensic Pathologist)
Actually, I didn't enjoy it.

380
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,880
You know what?

381
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,200
When I signed

382
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,720
those papers just now,

383
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,880
I felt free.

384
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,240
I shouldn't have said this
to my student.

385
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,680
Master,

386
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,400
you didn't enjoy it

387
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,800
because you don't like this job,

388
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,119
or was it because you went through
some cases

389
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:51,119
that changed your mind?

390
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:56,200
It's nothing special.

391
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,839
I liked the job at first,

392
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:02,319
but over time,

393
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:05,519
jobs have always been

394
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:08,160
frustrating, exhausting, and stressful.

395
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:10,440
No one enjoys working forever.

396
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:12,759
Look at me now.

397
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,039
Free and easy. Bye.

398
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,519
Master, let's have dinner tomorrow.

399
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,279
No thanks.

400
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,000
Don't you have anything to say to me?

401
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,400
Yes, he's still alive.

402
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,119
Where's he?

403
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,759
Do you think he'd stay in a place

404
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,359
and wait for us to catch him?

405
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:54,400
I'll explain everything later.

406
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,839
But right now isn't the time for this.

407
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,820
We need to catch Gai De
as quickly as possible.

408
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:11,440
Dress.

409
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:21,680
Torn dresses...

410
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,160
According to the Buhe Weather Station,

411
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:47,839
there will be heavy rainfall

412
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:50,240
in the next two hours.

413
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:51,759
It's reported

414
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,480
to last over 48 hours.

415
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,240
I found the proof.

416
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,590
How soon can you get here?

417
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,500
It's raining now.
The roads are blocked here.

418
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:04,319
I'll take a while.

419
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:05,820
It's dangerous for you
to act alone.

420
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,940
Don't do anything reckless.

421
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:07,640
Okay.

422
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:20,160
You're awake.

423
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:31,640
How do you feel now?

424
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,260
What did you do...

425
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:39,279
to me?

426
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,640
I fed you something
that made you obedient.

427
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,720
You're too naughty.

428
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,440
If I didn't need to lure Liao Zhibai,

429
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:56,079
I wouldn't have bothered
meeting you again.

430
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,960
Do you know?

431
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:08,039
Every time I smell you,

432
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,640
I know you're not the same kind.

433
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,680
Instead,

434
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:20,480
it's the stench of someone
looking for the truth.

435
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:23,000
Every time I see you,

436
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,039
I feel disgusted.

437
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:32,920
How funny.

438
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,160
I feel the same way.

439
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:43,640
I'm curious.

440
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,039
How did you find out about this artwork?

441
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:52,079
That dress

442
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:58,000
was handmade by Ti Yi's mom.

443
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,960
She used crewel work embroidery.

444
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,039
I recognized it at once.

445
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,039
So it wasn't me who found you.

446
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,079
It was a mother's love

447
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:21,759
for her daughter.

448
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:31,000
Oh, I forgot.

449
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,640
You don't have a mother.

450
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,160
You're smart.

451
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,960
But there are over a hundred
fabric scraps here.

452
00:33:56,839 --> 00:33:57,960
Each of them

453
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,440
was torn from a different woman.

454
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,480
As for Ti Yi, the one you mentioned,

455
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,160
I don't even remember
which one was hers.

456
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:12,480
I wanted to keep it as a keepsake.

457
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:15,679
It's your fault.

458
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,559
You're to blame.

459
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,519
Those ghost stories you told me

460
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:26,599
were all fake.

461
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,880
You invented a fake brother

462
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:34,679
and blamed all your dirty deeds on him

463
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,920
because you wanted to start afresh.

464
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,159
Not only did you fail
to take control of your life,

465
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,559
but you also lacked the courage
to face it.

466
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,159
You can only rely on drugs and sex

467
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,880
to escape from it all.

468
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:53,800
All you do is torture the weak.

469
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,199
You destroyed them effortlessly,

470
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:59,760
just for that pathetic little thrill.

471
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:03,800
You're nothing but a monster,

472
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,760
a scumbag, and trash.

473
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,320
That sounds very touching.

474
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,480
It makes me want to cry.

475
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,840
But I simply can't.

476
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:32,639
Are you trying to provoke me

477
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:36,480
or shouting to draw attention
from outside for help?

478
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,880
I forget to tell you.

479
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,480
This room

480
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:45,519
is my secret chamber.

481
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,800
You can see out from inside,

482
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,800
but people outside

483
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:51,920
won't see anything in here.

484
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,960
Everyone who's come here

485
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:56,519
has screamed way louder than you.

486
00:35:57,679 --> 00:35:59,199
But from the outside,

487
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:01,159
there's only silence.

488
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,000
And you

489
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,920
will soon vanish

490
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,800
along with all this so-called evidence.

491
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:21,920
Just like

492
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,360
the fire at your house ten years ago.

493
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,719
My dad was right.

494
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:39,719
Fire is the greatest thing ever
in this world.

495
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:44,000
It burns away everything,

496
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:45,920
beautiful or evil!

497
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,920
Everything disappears!

498
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,960
Reduces into ashes!

499
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,760
Who are you?

500
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,639
Rascal,

501
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,239
how dare you hurt my son!

502
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,110
Do you know who I am?

503
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,320
I don't care who you are.

504
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:29,559
Give me the key.

505
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,159
The key.

506
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,280
The smell on you...

507
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,000
Hand over the key!

508
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:38,880
I'll give it to you.

509
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:39,800
Here.

510
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:46,400
Rascal.

511
00:37:50,199 --> 00:37:51,519
Stop right there!

512
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,159
Jin,

513
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,400
let's save him first.

514
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:54,920
Siyuan.

515
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:56,360
Siyuan!

516
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,480
Chief Shu,

517
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,559
the artwork was burned.

518
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,960
Also, the hospital says

519
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,440
Liao Siyuan was drugged
with too much hydroxybutyric acid.

520
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:25,880
His condition is stable,

521
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,639
but they're not sure when he'll wake up.

522
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,080
There was a TV playing
in the background of his call.

523
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,480
The volume kept increasing.

524
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,260
That means he walked away from it.

525
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:10,400
(It's Ti Yi's dress.)

526
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,180
(The bloodstain oxidized
and turned black.)

527
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:13,280
(It's the evidence.)

528
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,230
He was given so much
hydroxybutyric acid,

529
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:37,480
yet he still woke up so early.

530
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:39,159
He's tough.

531
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:43,679
Don't worry.

532
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,239
Liao Zhibai,

533
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:49,840
what did you inject me with?

534
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,719
Don't worry. It's not AH7.

535
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,360
Just an anticoagulant.

536
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
It stops your blood from clotting.

537
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:02,119
If you get wounded,

538
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,320
you'll keep bleeding

539
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,800
and bleeding and bleeding

540
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,000
until you run dry.

541
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,640
Liao Zhibai, what are you trying to do?

542
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:11,239
Do you remember

543
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:14,679
where you stabbed Ti Yi?

544
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:16,360
Ti Yi?

545
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:19,039
Who's that?

546
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:21,400
I don't remember who that is.

547
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,679
Got it.

548
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,110
Let me help you refresh your memory.

549
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:31,199
Here?

550
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:32,880
Or here?

551
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,320
It's fine. I'll pick any spot.

552
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:38,040
One of them has to be right, right?

553
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,679
No.

554
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,440
The leg...

555
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:43,559
Leg. The leg isn't fatal.

556
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,119
I just wanted to scare her.

557
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,560
Didn't you say you couldn't remember?

558
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,480
I do.

559
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:55,239
She came with another girl.

560
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:56,880
She was the prettiest one there.

561
00:40:57,239 --> 00:40:57,599
She...

562
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:05,320
This is for Ti Yi.

563
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:13,679
This is for her mother, Shen Congxin.

564
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,480
No. Please!

565
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,000
Lang Sang.

566
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:27,719
The last one.

567
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:30,639
You should know who it is.

568
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
It's for Liao Zhibai.

569
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,440
Your blood will run dry soon.

570
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:04,320
You can either go to the hospital
or call the police.

571
00:42:05,079 --> 00:42:08,199
Do you know how far Ti Yi ran?

572
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,199
Three kilometers.

573
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,400
How far do you think
you can run this time

574
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,920
before you find someone who'll save you?

575
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:20,280
You're the prey this time.

576
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,639
Liao Zhibai,

577
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:26,960
you're a lunatic.

578
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:30,840
Just you wait.

579
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,239
Run. Just like how Ti Yi did back then.

580
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:38,800
Dad,

581
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:39,920
help me.

582
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:41,480
Dad,

583
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,119
help me...

584
00:44:04,679 --> 00:44:05,440
Dad,

585
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,199
