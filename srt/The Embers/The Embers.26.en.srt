1
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:19,960
Tai,

2
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,300
can you check this for me?

3
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:26,980
See if you can install a program

4
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:27,980
on this phone,

5
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:29,920
one that automatically

6
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,560
sends a message the moment it powers on.

7
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:38,640
This model is pretty old,

8
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:41,039
but it shouldn't be a problem.

9
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:42,719
What do you want to send?

10
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,920
A video from when I was young.

11
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,119
Siyuan will probably never forgive me

12
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,439
for what happened to Shen Congxin.

13
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,520
But for this last puzzle,

14
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:01,600
I know he wants the answer.

15
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,070
When the time comes, send this to him.

16
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,799
He'll understand what I mean.

17
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:13,280
You two brothers would never

18
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:15,280
show how much you care about each other.

19
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,079
Okay, I'll let you know

20
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:18,959
once I set it up.

21
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,079
Thanks.

22
00:02:23,425 --> 00:02:26,160
(MMS sent)

23
00:02:33,454 --> 00:02:38,000
(135 minutes before Liao Zhibai's death)

24
00:02:40,228 --> 00:02:42,080
(MMS delivered)

25
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:46,479
We fought,

26
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:48,159
but, to me...

27
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,479
What are you writing?

28
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,080
- Give it back!
- It's my brother, Liao Zhibai.

29
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,759
Give it back!

30
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:56,639
Oh, my God. Do you
worship me that much?

31
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,319
Oh, my.

32
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,800
You're making me blush.

33
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,759
I wish I could turn out to be
an adult like him.

34
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:05,639
I didn't mean it.

35
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:06,759
Just give it back!

36
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:08,039
You've written so much.

37
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,439
Come on, are you mad?

38
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,199
I'm just messing with you.

39
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,319
I'll say sorry.

40
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:17,360
Mom, tape this down.

41
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,760
Save it for this petty guy here.

42
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,710
This will be proof.

43
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,680
I, Liao Zhibai,

44
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:24,800
would like to apologize
to Liao Siyuan.

45
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,800
I'm sorry.

46
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:29,680
Don't be mad at me.

47
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,680
Forgive me, okay?

48
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,720
Didn't you say you'd
be back a few days later?

49
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:36,680
Siyuan,

50
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:37,759
I'm sorry

51
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,280
for treating you that.

52
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,820
There was only one reason I did that.

53
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,840
I had to keep you out
of what I was doing.

54
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,560
I've planned for everything.

55
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,080
I've decided to die.

56
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,319
But there's one thing

57
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:52,639
that could go wrong.

58
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,080
If the pen isn't enough

59
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,479
to convict Na Wei,

60
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,080
I need you to do
one last thing for me.

61
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:01,199
My body will be underwater, here.

62
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:03,159
Please use it well.

63
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,680
Siyuan,

64
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,400
this is our final plan.

65
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,439
Si...

66
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,920
Tell Li Zhi to prepare a gift box.

67
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,480

leave the rest to me.

104
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,360
I never woke up tonight,

105
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:46,159
and you had been staying by my bedside

106
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,080

107
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:53,960

How did you kill Liao Zhibai?

You look exhausted.

119
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,080
Haven't had a proper night's sleep

120
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,720
in a while, have you?

121
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:16,879
Just tell the truth.

122
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,320
If you confess,
maybe I can finally get some rest.

123
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,360
Is that really enough?

124
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,679
Have you ever stopped

125
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:32,600
to think about
what it is you truly want?

126
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,080
How did you kill Liao Zhibai?

127
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,039
Why is it so hard for you to understand?

128
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,639
You chase after the truth,

129
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,960
but is the truth really as important as

130
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:10,240
you believe?

131
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:14,720
You try to punish evil,

132
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,840
but does evil ever

133
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:20,360
truly receive
the punishment it deserves?

134
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,720
Everything you do,

135
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,029
and everything you fight for,

136
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:31,520
is nothing more than a performance
in the name of justice.

137
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,879
It helps you uphold the image
you have of yourself,

138
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:37,799
doesn't it?

139
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,960
So, how did

140
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,759
you kill Liao Zhibai?

141
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:45,919
I never planned to kill him.

142
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:49,840
But he hurt my son.

143
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:53,000
Where is my son?

144
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:55,759
Recognize this place?

145
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,159
Ten years ago,

146
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:01,840
this was where you almost killed me.

147
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,519
And yet, you're still alive.

148
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,000
If I weren't alive,

149
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,660
how else would I get to witness
how much you cared about your son?

150
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:13,720
Did you watch the videos I sent you?

151
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,399
Did you enjoy them?

152
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,720
But what you saw

153
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:19,960
was only a tiny fraction

154
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,120
of what Gai De actually went through.

155
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:27,120
AH7 is an amazing thing.

156
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:29,840
I ran so many experiments with it.

157
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:32,159
Just 3 milliliters,

158
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:34,360
after I injected it into his arm,

159
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,919
he could never lift it again.

160
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,630
After I injected it into his ear,

161
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,080
he lost all ability to hear.

162
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,960
After I injected it into his eyes,

163
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:46,080
his world turned
into eternal darkness...

164
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:46,679
Shut up!

165
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,240
You are a police officer.

166
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,919
You do what you're supposed to do.

167
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,000
And as a father,

168
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:10,080
I will do what I must.

169
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,200
That shouldn't be too hard
to understand, right?

170
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:46,519
No matter what,

171
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:47,960
this case is closed.

172
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,320
His intentional murder

173
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,960
is an irrefutable fact.

174
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,150
What about the other things?

175
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,870
Did he confess to everything?

176
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,380
We're still tracking the drug network.

177
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,759
Over the years,
Na Wei manufactured drugs,

178
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,080
but he wasn't trafficking them.

179
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,050
He used them as leverage

180
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,440
for business monopolies.

181
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,789
His connections run deep,

182
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:09,320
untangling them won't be something
we can solve in a day or two.

183
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,839
But don't worry,

184
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,800
we've started the investigation.

185
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,680
What did he say

186
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,600
about the fire that killed my family?

187
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,519
He has given up resisting.

188
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,780
He has admitted everything.

189
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,160
According to him,

190
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,360
he wanted to kill Liao Zhibai the moment

191
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,900
he started investigating the Ti Yi case.

192
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,480
But he hesitated because your
father still had the AH7 formula,

193
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,120
so instead of killing them outright,

194
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,039
he framed them for drug use

195
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,519
to teach them a lesson.

196
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:38,559
But he didn't expect
Liao Zhibai to keep digging

197
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,860
until he uncovered the drug
operation in Yong'an Village.

198
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,880
As for the murders
and arson that followed?

199
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,160
That was all Tie Xin's doing.

200
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:45,480
And the pen

201
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:46,839
was just an accident.

202
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:50,240
Right?

203
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,840
Something feels off to you, doesn't it?

204
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,510
There are still things
that don't add up.

205
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:00,039
For example,

206
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,480
Na Wei went through all that trouble

207
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,240
to break my brother
out of police custody,

208
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:05,279
just to get Gai De's location.

209
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,440
So why would he lose control

210
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,799
and kill him before
he got what he wanted?

211
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,400
And ten years ago,

212
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,319
if it was just
about silencing witnesses,

213
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,960
Tie Xin could've handled it.

214
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,690
There was no reason for Na Wei
to be at the crime scene himself.

215
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,839
So how did his pen end up there?

216
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:27,319
Now that Tie Xin is dead,

217
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,880
if Na Wei keeps his mouth shut,

218
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,030
no one will ever know

219
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:33,519
what really happened that night.

220
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:37,559
Every action leaves a trace.

221
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:39,000
We've started

222
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:41,240
digging into Na Wei's past,

223
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,070
but there's a lot to go through.

224
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,380
It's going to take some time.

225
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:49,160
Actually,

226
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,680
I came here today to turn myself in.

227
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:53,839
I assume you know

228
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:57,599
I was the one who placed my
brother's body at the intersection.

229
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:58,359
I knew.

230
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,400
Tampering with a body,

231
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,640
disturbing public order,

232
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,080
and disrupting social stability,

233
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,359
by law, carries a penalty
of 3 to 15 days in detention,

234
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,519
plus a fine.

235
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,559
And yet, you didn't
arrest me right away.

236
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:14,519
If I had,

237
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,599
the truth buried in the embers

238
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:18,240
would never have come to light.

239
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:28,080
Besides, I was going to Director's office,

240
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,920
to request disciplinary action
against myself.

241
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,980
Looks like we might end up

242
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,360
spending 15 days in jail together.

243
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:36,039
Shu He,

244
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,599
you never make mistakes.

245
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:41,359
Why?

246
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,160
Anyone

247
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:47,599
makes mistakes.

248
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,720
According to the law,

249
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:57,559
you'll be penalized as required.

250
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,000
There was no need to come
to me personally for this.

251
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:04,359
I'm sorry, Director.

252
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,000
I've let you down.

253
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,180
Oh, you do realize you made a mistake.

254
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,839
You think you're smart, don't you?

255
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,599
Think you're righteous?

256
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,279
Wanting to solve a case is good,

257
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,279
but you were too impatient.

258
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,520
So eager that you
were acting recklessly.

259
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,160
Did you really think

260
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:31,039
your little tricks alone

261
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,960
could take down Na Wei?

262
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:35,720
How naive.

263
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:41,839
The fact is, we've been

264
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:43,359
secretly investigating

265
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,359
Na Wei for over a year.

266
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,830
The police have substantial
evidence against him.

267
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,720
But because of the gravity of this case,

268
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,760
we've kept everything
under strict confidentiality.

269
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,799
We couldn't act

270
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,200
until we had an airtight case.

271
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,960
Liao Zhibai chose to fall
and became a criminal.

272
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,460
I won't bother discussing his choices.

273
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,110
But you?

274
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,300
You charged ahead recklessly,

275
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,720
and nearly ruined everything!

276
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:10,599
I didn't know
that was all part of your plan.

277
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,160
You guys.

278
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:18,599
You blindly assume
the law is full of loopholes,

279
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,559
but in reality,

280
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:23,000
nothing escapes the net of justice.

281
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,260
Liao Zhibai thought himself righteous,

282
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,520
but what did he actually do?

283
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,000
He manipulated and coerced victims,

284
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,720
pretending to offer them a hand,

285
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,400
when in reality, he dragged them

286
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:34,039
deeper into the abyss.

287
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,599
Remember this,

288
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,279
even if the goal is right,

289
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:41,880
the wrong methods

290
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:43,599
will corrupt it.

291
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,759
As police officers,

292
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,440
you and the others

293
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,039
haven't graduated

294
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,119
in my eyes yet.

295
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:56,079
And you, Liao Siyuan,

296
00:21:56,839 --> 00:21:57,799
you too,

297
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,839
failed.

298
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:03,759
Director,

299
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,120
I majored in Early Childhood Education.

300
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,480
So what?

301
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:11,039
If you want

302
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:14,079
to be a qualified police officer,

303
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,519
you can be.

304
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:20,119
Alright, enough! Get out!

305
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,559
The Supreme Court has ruled

306
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,599
that the defendant, Na Wei,

307
00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:58,119
is guilty of all seven charges,

308
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,759
including drug manufacturing

309
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,640
and trafficking, bribery,

310
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,519
evidence tampering, money laundering,

311
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,119
and premeditated murder.

312
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:10,380
Given the severity of the crimes and
the massive financial scale involved,

313
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,880
he has been sentenced to death.

314
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:26,960
Shu He.

315
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,400
You're really leaving?

316
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,279
Yes.

317
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:33,920
So, what's next for you?

318
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:36,200
No idea.

319
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:38,359
Maybe one day I'll decide

320
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:39,640
that dealing with the dead

321
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,839
is easier,

322
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,839
and I'll come back.

323
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,680
You'll probably be back pretty soon.

324
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,350
Here, take this.

325
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:49,799
Raise it for me.

326
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,920
I found it by the river.

327
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,860
I'm afraid my mom
will accidentally kill it.

328
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:55,599
Okay.

329
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,440
Bye.

330
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:00,839
Qi Xia.

331
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:04,920
I've got more free time now.

332
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,240
Let's grab a meal sometime.

333
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,519
Sure.

334
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:43,599
Here's your drink.

335
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,640
Thank you.

336
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:46,839
Come on.

337
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,680
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

338
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,240
Why are you leaving so suddenly?

339
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,800
What? You don't want me to go?

340
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,880
If you don't want me
to go, just say the word.

341
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,440
Who knows, maybe I'll change my mind.

342
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:10,039
Are you nervous?

343
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:12,680
I'm not.

344
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,200
I saw that little microexpression.

345
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:18,480
I really wasn't.

346
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:20,720
Li Zhi,

347
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,720
tell me you're not running off

348
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,680
just because of some unrequited love.

349
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,599
That's enough.

350
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:28,039
Don't talk nonsense.

351
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,880
I'm not good enough for her.

352
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:32,079
Come on, cheers.

353
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,279
Come on.

354
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,720
Don't mind him.

355
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,359
But, Liao Siyuan,

356
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,400
I actually do like you.

357
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,279
Maybe even more than

358
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:45,160
when I first met you.

359
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:49,480
During this period,

360
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,200
we've worked cases together,
and taken risks together.

361
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,119
We've seen the darkest
sides of the world,

362
00:25:57,079 --> 00:25:59,119
but also some of its
most beautiful stories.

363
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,240
I know

364
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:05,240
that I may never experience

365
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,960
anything like this again in my lifetime.

366
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,759
And when you've shared
a journey this intense with someone,

367
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,640
how could you just move on easily?

368
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,000
But it's because of this journey

369
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:27,960
that I'm even more certain now,

370
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:31,359
liking someone is important,
but it's not everything.

371
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:34,200
There's still so much

372
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:36,440
waiting for me out there.

373
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:38,839
New places,

374
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,319
new adventures,

375
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:42,359
and new faces.

376
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:49,640
This chapter of the story is over.

377
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,160
But maybe, someday,

378
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,920
in a new story,

379
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,599
we'll meet again.

380
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:05,279
We will.

381
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:07,119
Cheers.

382
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:07,920
Cheers.

383
00:27:45,522 --> 00:27:48,500
(Macbeth)

384
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,960
Prisoner 4639 is injured.

385
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:14,920
Requesting support.

386
00:28:42,358 --> 00:28:44,270
(Shu He)

387
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:46,920
Hello.

388
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,319
What did you say?

389
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,240
Wait for me. I'm coming right now.

390
00:28:57,724 --> 00:29:02,720
(POLICE)

391
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,640
Thank you.

392
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,559
How is Na Wei?

393
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:14,580
Still in critical condition.

394
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:16,799
Where did he get the blade?

395
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:20,759
The guard on duty confessed.

396
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,359
He took a bribe

397
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:24,440
to pass messages to Na Wei

398
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:25,980
and smuggled the blade in for him.

399
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,359
But that's not

400
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,200
the most baffling part.

401
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,500
Years ago, when Na Wei was running
for Chamber of Commerce President,

402
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:37,640
he carefully built this image
of being a philanthropist.

403
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,240
He regularly donated blood
at the city's blood bank.

404
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,559
Hello,

405
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:43,480
is this the city blood bank?

406
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:45,799
This is the Buhe Police Department.

407
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,900
We have a patient
with severe blood loss.

408
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,400
We need AB-type blood immediately.

409
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,279
That's the strange part.

410
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:52,079
Thank you.

411
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,960
According to the blood bank records,

412
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,920
Na Wei's blood type is B.

413
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:00,200
But he's actually AB.

414
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:06,279
That pen!

415
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,240
That's right.

416
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,799
Liao Zhibai must have
been absolutely certain

417
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,039
that the pen contained

418
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:13,359
Na Wei's DNA.

419
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,480
That's why he was willing
to risk everything on it.

420
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:16,799
But things didn't go as planned.

421
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,160
We all assumed the problem
was with the evidence.

422
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,720
But what if

423
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,880
the evidence was fine,

424
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,359
and the real problem was him?

425
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:31,000
Did you compare

426
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:31,920
his DNA

427
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,920
with Gai De's?

428
00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:35,359
We're running the test.

429
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,640
But if we prove

430
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,440
this person isn't Na Wei,

431
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,519
then who is he?

432
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,700
There are only a few explanations

433
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,200
for someone looking this identical.

434
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:47,660
Either he's a close relative,

435
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,160
or he had plastic surgery,

436
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,480
both of which are easy to verify.

437
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,359
But there's one more possibility.

438
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:55,039
A pure coincidence.

439
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,519
Two completely unrelated people

440
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,440
who just happen to look the same.

441
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,920
If that's the case,
finding the original person

442
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,079
would be like
searching for a needle in a haystack.

443
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,279
When was the last time

444
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:12,640
Na Wei officially donated blood?

445
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,000
2007.

446
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:17,480
Then we investigate in reverse.

447
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:21,759
For someone to become another person,

448
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:24,599
the original version

449
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:25,920
has to disappear.

450
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:28,839
The Na Wei before 2007

451
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:30,720
and the Na Wei after 2007

452
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,920
are not the same person.

453
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:33,920
So all we have to do

454
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,940
is check missing persons
cases from after 2007,

455
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:37,880
and start narrowing it down.

456
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:48,000
That's our best shot.

457
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,720
But even so,
this is still a needle in a haystack.

458
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:10,680
By the way,

459
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:12,279
remember how I've been

460
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,640
investigating AH7 these past few weeks?

461
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,820
I found a murder case from 20 years ago,

462
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:19,070
reported by a small-town police station.

463
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:20,799
Inside the victim's home,

464
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:24,400
they found equipment and raw materials

465
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,640
for producing AH7.

466
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,760
But the formula itself was missing.

467
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,079
That man might have been

468
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:31,720
the original creator of AH7.

469
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:36,359
So someone wanted his formula,

470
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,400
and killed him for it.

471
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,680
Was the case ever solved?

472
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:43,119
There was a prime suspect,

473
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:44,799
but they were never caught.

474
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,990
I've requested copies of the case files.

475
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,080
They should arrive tomorrow.

476
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,240
I'll show them to you then.

477
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,039
Okay.

478
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,480
Look at this man.

479
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,680
Does he look like him?

480
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:11,359
He does.

481
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,759
This case file says the person

482
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:17,020
who reported the case
was a theater troupe owner.

483
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:17,920
The guy in the photo

484
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,640
was one of the actors under that troupe.

485
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,350
He went missing for several days,

486
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:24,680
almost causing their production
to shut down.

487
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,510
The police searched for
two days, found nothing,

488
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,600
and the case was quietly dropped.

489
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:31,839
An actor?

490
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,039
Got it.

491
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,480
The paternity test results are in.

492
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,720
Na Wei and Gai De

493
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,079
are not related.

494
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,720
You knew that the current Na Wei

495
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,279
wasn't really your biological father.

496
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,920
So you cooperated with the police
to secure the evidence,

497
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,030
isn't that right?

498
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,639
I've been sentenced to death.

499
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,039
I'm about to die.

500
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,239
Why should I cooperate with you?

501
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,840
Because before you die,

502
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,239
don't you want a real answer?

503
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:33,540
I have two paternity
test reports right here.

504
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,679
One compares

505
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,840
your DNA

506
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,119
with the biological material

507
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,400
found on Liao Zhibai's pen.

508
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:42,719
The other compares

509
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,740
your DNA with the man
you've been calling "father".

510
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,239
The pen?

511
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:02,380
So, Liao Zhibai was
right all along, wasn't he?

512
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,880
The one who killed his parents,

513
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:09,559
that was my real father?

514
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,400
He was already dead.

515
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,760
He's been dead for years.

516
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,760
I knew it.

517
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,679
There's no way he didn't love you.

518
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,280
When I was ten,

519
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:46,079
my mom used to beat me.

520
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,800
Every day. She hit me every day.

521
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,360
Everyday! Everyday!

522
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:51,519
And he always protected me.

523
00:35:54,039 --> 00:35:55,920
When did you start suspecting?

524
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:00,039
When we played the game...

525
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:08,159
Since you told me the truth,

526
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:10,400
I'll tell you everything.

527
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:11,880
But...

528
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,320
Are you sure

529
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,000
you want to open

530
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:27,960
