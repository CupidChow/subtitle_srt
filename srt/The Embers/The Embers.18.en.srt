00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:22,800
Oh, no.

2
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:40,119
Help!

3
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,280
Who are you?

4
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,079
How can you help me?

5
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,640
As long as you can get rid of him,

6
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,519
I'll do whatever you want.

7
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,359
A trade, then.

8
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,120
Just help us with one thing.

9
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,959
It's you...

10
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,360

They haven't come out yet?

(Gan)

20
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,199
Fatty.

21
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:39,480
Why are you shaking? Afraid?

22
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,240
I'm excited.

23
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,519
I can't wait to catch them.

24
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:46,319
Just two petty thieves...

25
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,920
I can handle them myself.

26
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,200
What's there to be afraid of?

27
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,839
Not exactly petty thieves.

28
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,940
They've pulled off
four heists this month alone,

29
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,160
stealing nearly 900 grand in jewelry.

30
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:57,959
And I'm guessing they have...

31
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,120
this.

32
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,920
What's the matter?
Feeling the adrenaline rush now?

33
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,920
That was adrenaline before,

34
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,720
but now it's just the coconut water.

35
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,240
I drank seven of these.

36
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,660
Hold it in a little longer.

37
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,319
Stay patient.

38
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,279
They'll show up soon.

39
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:17,629
I can't hold back anymore.

40
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,760
I have to use the restroom.

41
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,640
You're like a lazy donkey
refusing to grind.

42
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:24,839
They are out.

43
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,630
Are you sure it's them?

44
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,070
Their attire confirms it.

45
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,920
It has to be them.

46
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:15,879
Oh, no.

47
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,440
We left Gan behind. What should we do?

48
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,270
We can't afford to wait.
We might lose them.

49
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:19,879
Seize them!

50
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,279
Take this!

(Buhe Police Academy)

52
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:16,720
Wait! They're one of us!

53
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:20,360
Upholding justice,

54
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,360
stepping in to stop crimes,

55
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,000
staking out thieves,

56
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,700
and taking the law
into your own hands.

57
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,240
Impressive, huh?

58
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,399
You all think you're heroes?

59
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,660
You think us are
sitting around doing nothing?

60
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,560
And you!

61
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:38,399
So darn smart, aren't you?

62
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:40,959
Sure, you provided a lead,

63
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,280
but without police intervention,

64
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,639
can you catch those jewel thieves?

65
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,519
Chief Lei Nuo,

66
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,160
we'll definitely learn from you!

67
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,720
Cut the flattery.

68
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,680
Here, take this.

69
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,900
Sign the settlement agreement

70
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,920
and pay for the damages.

71
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,959
This case is closed.

72
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,300
Wanting to solve crimes
is a good thing,

73
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,759
but you're too impatient.

74
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,199
Being a police is a lifelong commitment.

75
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:09,120
You can't just act on impulse,

76
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,160
or let emotions drive your actions.

77
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,160
If you can't rein in your
reckless sense of justice,

78
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,000
you'll end up on the wrong path.

79
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,399
Chief Lei,

80
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,800
is it wrong to pursue justice?

81
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:24,480
Your goal is right,

82
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,000
but your method is wrong.

83
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,920
And when the method is wrong,

84
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,800
the goal ends up being wrong too.

85
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,799
Being a good police

86
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,279
isn't that simple.

87
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,680
You still have a lot to learn.

88
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,799
Don't worry, sir.

89
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,240
We will learn.

90
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,799
You think I don't know?

91
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,240
You say that now,

92
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:45,759
but I bet you're cursing me

93
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:47,159
in your head.

94
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,039
Well...

95
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,159
Alright,

96
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:55,480
listen up,

97
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,480
don't let your impulses ruin you,

98
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,559
but also, don't let life wear down
your sharp edges.

99
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,360
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

100
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:03,879
Alright,

101
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,600
you're all police academy rookies.

102
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,340
Since fate has brought
you to each other,

103
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,600
- let's shake hands.
- Rookies?

104
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,380
Let's call it even.

105
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,880
Where did you get those uniforms then?

106
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,399
Bought them online.

107
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:15,360
Want the link?

108
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,960
So fake. No thanks.

109
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,080
Alright, enough chit-chat. Shake hands.

110
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,799
Okay.

111
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:21,740
It's really fine.

112
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,400
And you.

113
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,519
Hand out.

114
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,039
Let's shake.

115
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:25,840
Come on.

116
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:27,960
Best of luck

117
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,799
with your studies.

118
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:33,240
I will see you here four years later.

119
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,030
Yes, sir!

120
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,960
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

121
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:42,039
Wearing fakes.

122
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,030
At least I have something.

123
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:45,399
It looks so fake.

124
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,540
Want another fight?

125
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,200
Bring it on!

126
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:01,759
Come on,

127
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,480
here's to our friendship
born from a fight.

128
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,120
To our friendship born from a fight.

129
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,399
I've always wanted to ask...

130
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:09,559
Why did you decide to become a police?

131
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:11,679
Because being a police

132
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,220
makes it easier to find a girlfriend.

133
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,480
That's all you're aiming for? Seriously?

134
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,860
Imitating me again if you dare!

135
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,480
Sorry, sorry.

136
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,279
Let's drink.

137
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,360
Liao Zhibai,

138
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,240
I got you guys an extra dish.

139
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,039
Crabs!

140
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,080
Crabs!

141
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,270
Let me introduce everyone,

142
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,580
this is Lang Sang.

143
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,280
(Lang Sang)
He's one of our fellow rookies.

144
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:33,679
Let me introduce them.

145
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:34,840
This is Gan.

146
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:35,559
Tai.

147
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:36,840
Su Taipu.

148
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:39,080
Welcome, Lang Sang!

149
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,000
Cheers!

150
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,240
I'm not finished.

151
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:42,960
Your turn.

152
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,360
I'm different from the rest of you.

153
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,840
I think being a police
means being a hero,

154
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:51,440
and giving the people
I love a sense of security.

155
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,399
But Bai... Bai Han...

156
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:55,600
When I first saw you this afternoon,

157
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,580
you were dressed head
to toe in designer brands.

158
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,800
Born in a rich family,
why do you want to be a police?

159
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:02,720
As for me, I'm here because

160
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,879
of Liao Zhibai.

161
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,480
I just like following him.

162
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:07,480
Whatever he does, I do.

163
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,200
Wherever he goes, I go.

164
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,030
Indeed.

165
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,320
A sleuth like me,

166
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,799
of course, everyone wants to follow me

167
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,440
and learn how to crack cases, right?

168
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,200
Alright then, Sleuth Liao Zhibai,

169
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,360
why did you want to become a police?

170
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:23,919
Me?

171
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,700
Ever since I was a kid,
I've always wanted to be a police.

172
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,300
It's like there was some invisible force

173
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,360
calling out to me,

174
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:37,320
and telling me
that you have to become a police.

175
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,910
It also happens to be what
I'm most passionate about,

176
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,519
and pretty good at.

177
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,960
Plus, back in my village,
everyone called me

178
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,759
a genius sleuth.

179
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:48,759
Just kidding!

180
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,600
Lang Sang, what about you?

181
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,240
Why did you want to become a police?

182
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:53,320
Honestly,

183
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,480
after hearing all of you,
I feel kind of ashamed.

184
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,799
I never really wanted to be a police.

185
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,240
Well, my family's poor.

186
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,039
And being a police

187
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:03,000
means a stable job.

188
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,000
Plus, they give us
uniforms for all four seasons,

189
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,960
so I don't have to spend money
on clothes.

190
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,120
Don't listen to his humble act.

191
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:11,600
He got in effortlessly.

192
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:12,679
He's seriously talented.

193
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,679
No, I'm not.

194
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,399
I did think of a backup plan.

195
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:16,759
If I don't make it as a police,

196
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:18,879
I'll just open a little shop

197
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,080
right outside the academy.

198
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,560
With so many students here,

199
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,870
I'd never be short on customers.

200
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,920
We haven't even started school yet,

201
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,390
so don't jinx it with defeatist talk.

202
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,480
That's not what I meant.

203
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,600
But as you know,

204
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,080
there is a fighting contest
one week after we start school.

205
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:32,480
With my physique...

206
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:36,679
You're right.

207
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,519
We'll help you, of course!

208
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,440
You really fell for it, didn't you?

209
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,440
- Come on, cheers!
- Come on, cheers!

210
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,679
Thanks, guys.

211
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:49,440
Come on.

212
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,679
I'll finish my bottle.

213
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:54,200
Sorry, I rarely drink.

214
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,039
Sorry.

215
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,559
Sorry.

216
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:56,159
Honestly,

217
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:57,720
the reason

218
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,080
we didn't get punished

219
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,880
for fighting and causing chaos
on the streets

220
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,560
isn't because we're police academy
rookies with special privileges.

221
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,860
It's because Liao Zhibai solved the case

222
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:07,759
and made up for it.

223
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,759
Let's all toast to Liao Zhibai!

224
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:10,960
Hold on, hold on!

225
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,420
Don't think you can just raise
a glass and be done with it.

226
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,380
I solved this case.

227
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,360
Call me Master.

228
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,720
Forget it.

229
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:19,440
Let's just call him Dad!

230
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,200
Hang on, you guys...

231
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,320
Call him Dad?

232
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:24,519
Dad!

233
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:25,960
Dad!

234
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,679
Screw you!

235
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,840
I can't call him that.

236
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:32,679
Let me show you my talent.

240
00:14:27,602 --> 00:14:29,290
This restaurant has
been closed for years.

Granny Yun has been sent
to Elderly Care Center by Liao Siyuan.

247
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,700
I checked. There's only
surveillance at the entrance,

248
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,920
which makes it easier for us
to visit her in the future.

249
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,639
I went to see her this afternoon.

250
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,720
She's in better condition
than I expected.

251
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:47,120
Weren't you worried

252
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,080
about Tie Xin's people spotting you?

253
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,480
I've been hiding in the dark
for so long.

254
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,320
It's about time
I stepped into the light.

(Elderly Care Center, Buhe City)

256

(Good Luck Restaurant)

257
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:52,559
Granny Yun has been taken.

258
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,600
They put her in an ambulance.

License plate BH3218.

260
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,550
There were two men on board.

261
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:02,519
One of them has
a scar above his left eye.

262
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,320
He's probably one of Tie Xin's men,

263
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,880
a thug they call "One-Eye."

264
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:07,880
Gan.

265
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,350
I have some connections on the street.

266
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,240
I'll ask around.

267
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,359
I'm going with him.

268
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:13,640
We're not finished.
Let's continue our game later.

269
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,460
Okay.

270
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,480
You were probably caught

271
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,060
on surveillance yesterday afternoon.

272
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,000
You can't go.

273
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,039
This is obviously a trap.

274
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,640
They're using her as bait to lure us in.

275
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,309
The surveillance

276
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,820
shows that the ambulance
has been parked here for over an hour.

277
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,920
Why would they bring her
to such a remote place?

278
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,640
It's not Tie Xin.

279
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,480
Who is it then?

280
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,400
Someone who really wants to see me.

281
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:30,240
Long time no see.

282
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:40,160
You've grown taller.

283
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,240
You, on the other hand,

284
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,720
haven't changed at all.

285
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,440
Why didn't you come looking for me?

286
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,440
It's been ten years.

287
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,400
I thought you were dead.

288
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,510
But you were alive this whole time.

289
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,079
So why didn't you come to me?

290
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,380
Where have you been
for the past ten years?

291
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,799
What is going on?

292
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,160
Are you hungry?

293
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,519
I'm starving.

294
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:40,839
Buy me some noodles.

295
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:48,880
It's so good.

296
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,400
Aren't you going to eat?

297
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,200
Don't waste it.

298
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,319
I'll finish it.

299
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,279
What's wrong?

300
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,960
You've been glaring at me.

301
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,830
It's not that I didn't want to find you,

302
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,839
but I couldn't.

303
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,559
Liao Zhibai had to be a dead man.

304
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,640
So that Liao Siyuan could live

305
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,200
under the sun.

306
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,270
Our parents are dead because of me.

307
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,200
I couldn't destroy your life too.

308
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,800
What do you mean because of you?

309
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,200
Do you know

310
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,400
who first started producing
AH7 in our village?

311
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,559
It was our father.

312
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,799
That's impossible.

313
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,839
I didn't believe it either at first.

314
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,720
But then I found out

315
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:09,270
that when they talked about their
merchandise, they were referring to AH7.

316
00:22:37,736 --> 00:22:42,290
(AH7 Precursor Material Purchase Order)

317
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:50,240
Village Chief,

318
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,720
this is the basic plan for now.

319
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:54,039
So,

320
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,240
think about it when you have time.

321
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,799
Got it. I'll think about it.

322
00:22:58,799 --> 00:22:59,880
Anyway, I came...

323
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:00,960
One second.

324
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,880
The main reason I'm here today

325
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,039
is that shipment.

326
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,860
They've been pressing me for two weeks.

327
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,799
We can't keep delaying.

328
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,200
You know how tight
the investigations have been lately.

329
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,559
Plus, the raw materials are stuck.

330
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,660
Tell them to wait a little longer.

331
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,360
But...

332
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:22,640
First,

333
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,640
you told me it was a production issue.

334
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:26,880
Now, you're saying

335
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,070
it's a raw material problem.

336
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:32,480
Feels like you're stalling on purpose.

337
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,440
Why would I do that?

338
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,640
Don't worry.

339
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,790
Just head back for now.

340
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:05,960
Dad.

341
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,640
Are you looking for this?

342
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:26,880
When did this start?

343
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:33,200
Two years ago.

344
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,519
I got my hands on a secret formula.

345
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:42,039
Easy money.

346
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,039
So, I gathered a group of people

347
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,480
and started production.

348
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,119
Dad,

349
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,039
do you have any idea what you're doing?

350
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,359
This is illegal.

351
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,279
You're making drugs!

352
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,319
Besides Dad,

353
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:15,400
Song En, Tai Shu, and Nu Na

354
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,400
were in it too.

355
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,640
The dried fruit factory

356
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,599
was their drug lab.

357
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,440
Every time a batch was produced,

358
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,119
a man named Tie Xin

359
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,000
would smuggle it into Buhe
for distribution.

360
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,940
That night, when I found out
about all of this,

361
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:32,960
I had a huge fight with Dad.

362
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,559
It got ugly.

363
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,400
I told him,

364
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:39,000
he had one night.

365
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:40,720
Once the sun came up,

366
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:42,279
I was going to the police.

367
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,240
Dad.

368
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,880
I've fixed the broken steps

369
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,400
and patched up the courtyard.

370
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,160
I've told

371
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,160
your mom what needs to be taken care of.

372
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:01,440
Once I settle things

373
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,480
at the factory,

374
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:04,880
I'll turn myself in.

375
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:11,799
Well, there's no need to rush.

376
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,270
It's bound to happen sooner or later.

377
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:17,079
Oh,

378
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,680
there's something

379
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:21,400
I need to discuss with you.

380
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:25,119
What is it?

381
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:30,279
From start to finish,

382
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,640
this was just the few of us.

383
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,920
Your mother knew nothing.

384
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:38,279
I'll take them and turn ourselves in.

385
00:26:39,319 --> 00:26:40,359
Once I'm gone,

386
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:43,240
I'm leaving Siyuan

387
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:45,519
and your mom

388
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:46,960
in your hands.

389
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,160
You really think they'll listen to you?

390
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,750
They will.

391
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:01,920
Okay.

392
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:07,400
I'll go talk to them now.

393
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:35,039
But we were too naive.

394
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,880
Those people never
intended to turn themselves in.

395
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:40,400
They were terrified

396
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,309
that if Dad confessed,

397
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,940
he'd drag them all down with him.

398
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:45,799
So they came up with another plan,
a fire.

399
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:48,000
One that would erase
all their loose ends.

400
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:01,559
Look at the fire.

401
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,359
It's beautiful!

402
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,820
(Message not sent. Resend?)
(Son, don't come home!)

403
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,240
(Run!)

404
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:08,519
But they pulled
three bodies from the fire.

405
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:12,680
The third body, besides Mom and Dad,

406
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:14,240
was one of Tie Xin's men.

407
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:16,759
I don't know who he was,

408
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,749
but they must have bribed the coroner

409
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,840
to make sure that corpse
was identified as me.

410
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:24,279
How did you escape?

411
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:25,440
Because, just like you,

412
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,279
I wasn't home

413
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:30,559
when the fire started.

414
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,110
I was by the river outside the village.

415
00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:36,279
Someone shot me.

416
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,680
I don't know who it was.

417
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,640
And then, I fell into the water

418
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,920
and lost consciousness.

419
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,079
Su Pa saved me.

420
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,759
It wasn't some accidental disaster.

421
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:52,519
It was a carefully orchestrated murder.

422
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,759
What about your toxicology report?

423
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,599
Since they had started the fire,

424
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,319
there had to be someone
to blame for it, right?

425
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,759
And who else

426
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:05,559
would be a more
convenient scapegoat than me?

427
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,079
The killers had their story planned

428
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,000
from the very beginning.

429
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:13,880
They spiked my water

430
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:15,559
with AH7,

431
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:16,960
and then reported me

432
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:19,920
for a drug test.

433
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,119
The toxicology report

434
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,200
was inevitable.

435
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,720
The evidence was airtight,

436
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:29,880
and the motive perfectly constructed.

437
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,070
And just like that,

438
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,940
the story of Liao Zhibai,

439
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,300
a drug-addled addict
who burned his entire family alive

440
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,750
was set in stone.

441
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,519
Flawless. A perfectly crafted lie.

442
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,079
After becoming a dead man,

443
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,799
I laid low for a while.

444
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,480
Then I heard about Bai Han.

445
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:51,960
He had bought the restaurant
where we used to gather,

446
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:54,000
and he was still
investigating in secret.

447
00:31:59,582 --> 00:32:05,880
(Detective Liao Zhibai's
Drug Use and Arson)

448
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:14,160
Who is there?

449
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:45,799
You're alive?

450
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:51,119
I'm alive.

451
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:04,480
From now on,

452
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,839
it's a fight to the death.

453
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:12,400
From now on,

454
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,000
it's a fight to the death.

455
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:41,800
Liao Zhibai,

456
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,519
you told everyone around you.

457
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,320
Why didn't you tell me?

458
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,480
I was the only fool
who thought everything was gone.

459
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:56,599
That our home was gone,

460
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:58,880
that Mom and Dad were gone,

461
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:01,000
and that you were gone.

462
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:07,080
In the end, I was the only one
left in the dark.

463
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:11,320
Why couldn't you have told me sooner?

464
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,960
At least then, I could've
faced this with you.

465
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,599
Siyuan,

466
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,480
do you know
what my only goal in staying alive

467
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,480
has been?

468
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,000
Revenge.

469
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:27,159
Sounds simple, right?

470
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,760
Easy to say.

471
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:30,860
But you have no idea

472
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,760
what these past ten years
have been like for me.

473
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,920
For the first two years,

474
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,599
I could barely survive.

475
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,390
I had no place to stay,
and no food to eat.

476
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:46,519
I scavenged from trash piles
just to fill my stomach.

477
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:49,400
I didn't want you

478
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,719
to live that kind of life.

479
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:55,480
All I ever wanted was for you

480
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,079
to live a normal, peaceful life.

481
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:58,880
Do you understand?

482
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,840
It's not that I never tried to find you.

483
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:06,360
I was always watching from the shadows.

484
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,039
Zhibai, it's so warm.

485
00:36:26,773 --> 00:36:30,900
(Warmth in Spring)

486
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Come on, cheers.

487
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,599
Cheers!

488
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,280
Cheers!

489
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,840
Why couldn't I go out and protect you?

490
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,440
But it's okay.

491
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,519
You grew up

492
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:08,559
to be kind and brave.

493
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,920
Do you have any idea

494
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:14,039
what it's like to see your family

495
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:15,589
standing right in front of you

496
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:17,280
and not be able to call out to them?

497
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:21,079
So I could only stay in the shadows,

498
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:23,599
waiting for the right moment.

499
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,240
Because the moment I appeared,

500
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,519
all the peace would be shattered.

501
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:30,679
But the moment

502
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:31,840
you cut off Lai La's head,

503
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:35,400
that peace was already gone.

504
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,199
I know.

505
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:43,710
If the first ten years
of my life at the academy

506
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:44,960
taught me about justice,

507
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,960
about punishing crime through the law,

508
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,640
then these past ten years
have taught me something else,

509
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:51,840
an eye for an eye,

510
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,599
a tooth for a tooth.

511
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,740
Even the tiniest sliver of conscience
would be nothing

512
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,360
but a chain holding me back.

513
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,320
What justice.

514
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,920
So, Siyuan,

515
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:14,960
let me be the monster alone.

516
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:18,639
The world needs the truth.

517
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,190
Will you let me do that?

518
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:21,480
But I know everything now.

519
00:38:21,559 --> 00:38:22,320
So what?

520
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:24,840
Are you going to turn me in?

521
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,400
No.

522
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:50,719
I'm going to help you.

523
00:38:52,519 --> 00:38:53,440
I don't need your help.

524
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,880
I don't care if you need it or not.

525
00:38:56,639 --> 00:38:58,039
I make my own choice.

526
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:01,079
You don't get to decide for me.

527
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:13,559
You really have grown up.

528
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:16,719
Don't tell Xia

529
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,039
that I'm alive.

530
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:19,880
