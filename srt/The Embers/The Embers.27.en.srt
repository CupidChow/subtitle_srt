1
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,519
(May 18, 2009)
The business has been slow.

2
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:17,920
May the River Spirit bless

3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,199
our village

4
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:22,320
with peaceful weather.

5
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:25,879
The dried fruit factory
is doing quite well.

6
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:30,519
It's all thanks to Qi.

7
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,280
When you have time,

8
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,359
you should help her out.

9
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,840
All right.

10
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,119
Don't just say it.

11
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,640
It's the Chinese New Year now.

12
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:41,520
Only she and her daughter left.

13
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,679
See if they need anything.

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,479
Give them a hand.

15
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:46,880
All right.

16
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,560
Siyuan.

17
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:49,520
Siyuan,

18
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,479
come get the things.

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,359
Aunt Meihua.

20
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,020
How many times do I have to tell you?

21
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:53,880
Call me Ms. Meihua.

22
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,520
Ms. Meihua.

23
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:57,320
The latest sneakers.

24
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,159
You didn't have to do this.

25
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:02,119
How did you buy so many things?

26
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,000
Try them on.

27
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:04,599
You've bought a lot.

28
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,200
It's all right.

29
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:08,000
Boys grow fast,

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,200
especially their feet.

31
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,040
Also, what's the point of making money
if you don't spend it?

32
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,159
Mrs. Liao,

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,640
these heels are
the latest limited edition.

34
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,719
Only one pair in each color.

35
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:21,439
They had our sizes,

36
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:22,840
so I quickly bought them.

37
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,239
They seem too young.

38
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:25,120
You're young.

39
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,000
All right.

40
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:28,760
And this color...

41
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,640
Macbeth?

42
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,400
What 'beth'?

43
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,879
I thought it was a movie.

44
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:40,120
The townfolks told me this was a play,

45
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,200
so I went to watch it.

46
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,519
A play? Was it good?

47
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:46,920
It was boring.

48
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:48,640
I was sleeping there.

49
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,120
Here. Try this on.

50
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,480
They're beautiful.

51
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,260
Do you like them?

52
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:53,870
Yes.

53
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,120
Mr. Liao, this is for you.

54
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,000
Stop looking.

55
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,319
Your favorite wine.

56
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,079
Qi,

57
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,920
it's not easy to make money.

58
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,439
Xia is still young, after all.

59
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:06,200
You need to think about the future.

60
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:08,840
There's no need to worry about her.

61
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:11,759
She has Zhibai, right?

62
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:14,719
True. He should be worried about

63
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,159
his future wife.

64
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,159
Here, Mrs. Liao.

65
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,960
Try this pair on.

66
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,479
This color looks even younger.

67
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,800
They look too young.

68
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,919
You look great in them.

69
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:23,759
Don't you agree?

70
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,629
I can't walk properly in them.

71
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,440
Look at your mom.
Doesn't she look great?

72
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,360
You look amazing, Mom.

73
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,199
Nice?

74
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,080
They all say you look great in them.

75
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,719
Everyone agrees.

76
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:33,470
All right.

77
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:34,960
Let's wear these

78
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,039
for the family photo later.

79
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:36,960
Family photo?

80
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:38,159
What's that, Mom?

81
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,639
It's the Chinese New Year.

82
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,360
I noticed

83
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:43,080
we don't have

84
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,800
a proper family photo.

85
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:47,199
So I hired a photographer from the town.

86
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:49,159
Let's have one later.

87
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,240
- Sure.
- That's great.

88
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,540
Good. Let's take a family photo.

89
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,000
Come on.

90
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,680
Wait.

91
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,000
I need to clean up myself nicely.

92
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:55,520
Here you go.

93
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,719
You look great in them.

94
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:58,960
Beautiful. You look fairer now.

95
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,360
Is my hair okay?

96
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:02,240
Yes. You look good.

97
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:02,840
Handsome.

98
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,919
All right. Look over here.

99
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:06,719
Good. Three, two, one.

100
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:07,599
Cheese.

101
00:04:32,515 --> 00:04:41,520
=The Embers=

102
00:04:43,256 --> 00:04:45,600
=Episode 27=

103
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:52,839
Please come in.

104
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,120
Take a look around.

105
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:57,949
The theater may be a bit small,

106
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,680
but it's been standing
for nearly 30 years.

107
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,560
We had

108
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,300
an interior renovation a few years ago.

109
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,280
It looks pretty new.

110
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,270
We've staged quite a few
major performances here,

111
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,800
like Hamlet and Macbeth.

112
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:08,680
Macbeth?

113
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:11,389
Yes, we've also done

114
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,920
plenty of Shakespeare's plays.

115
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,959
Do you still have the records
of previous performances?

116
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,879
Yes. Let me find them for you.

117
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:20,879
Feel free to browse.

118
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,720
Sure.

119
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,000
You may have a look at this.

120
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:38,879
Thank you.

121
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:39,439
No problem.

122
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:58,360
Do you remember this person?

123
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,639
This actor...

124
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,600
I actually remember him pretty well.

125
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,639
He's a good actor.

126
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,560
However, there were issues

127
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,759
within the troupe.

128
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,279
They weren't paying enough,

129
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:12,839
so many actors left.

130
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,320
I remember we signed him for ten shows,

131
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,100
but he didn't make it through
half of them.

132
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,600
We argued with them for a long time.

133
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,279
How many performances
did he actually do, and when?

134
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,800
Four.

135
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,519
I can't remember

136
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:26,360
the exact dates.

137
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,240
You may look into it.

138
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:30,959
They were all on weekends in October.

139
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:32,519
All right. Thank you.

140
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,199
No problem.

141
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,710
(Macbeth Finale)

142
00:07:32,405 --> 00:07:34,180
(Macbeth Finale)

143
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,460
Doesn't this sound familiar?

144
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,360
You performed Macbeth 207 times.

145
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,399
Whenever the show ends,

146
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:51,720
the theater plays this music

147
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,040
to signal the audience to leave.

148
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,040
No matter how full or empty
the seats were,

149
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,839
you stood there until the music ended,

150
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,720
watching the last audience member leave.

151
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:14,800
For a very long time,

152
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:18,079
no matter how hard you tried,

153
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,720
the tickets wouldn't sell.

154
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,000
The troupe faced losses

155
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,040
and even considered canceling your show.

156
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,920
You auditioned for other troupes,

157
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:33,600
but none of them chose you.

158
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,960
They all preferred
exaggerated performances.

159
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,360
Compared to them,

160
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:42,600
your acting seems dull.

161
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,919
What do you mean?

162
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,159
Still, it cried to all the house.

163
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:49,320
"Sleep no more".

164
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,759
Glamis hath murdered sleep,

165
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:53,919
and therefore Cawdor
shall sleep no more.

166
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:56,200
Macbeth shall sleep no more.

167
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:10,639
It's fine.

168
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,559
Let's take a break.

169
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,559
Excuse me.

170
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,320
Excuse me.

171
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:43,759
I...

172
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,480
I played Macbeth just now.

173
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:51,320
I noticed you fell asleep.

174
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,720
May I ask

175
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:57,879
if my performance wasn't good?

176
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:01,279
Everyone's understanding of acting
is too shallow.

177
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,360
They think good acting is

178
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,440
just about crying

179
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,870
or the so-called traditional
academy performance style.

180
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:07,920
All they ever talk about

181
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,630
are the latest Brecht techniques.

182
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,679
But in fact, Stanislavski's system

183
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:14,519
is the most classic approach.

184
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:16,639
You experience a character
and become them.

185
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:18,360
It's not acting

186
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,840
on stage,

187
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,519
it's life.

188
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,360
The true performance

189
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,279
shouldn't have any techniques.

190
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,840
Yesterday afternoon,

191
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,420
the prominent entrepreneur, Mr. Na Wei,

192
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,320
representing his corporation,

193
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,559
signed a seafood supply agreement
with Meixin Food Services.

194
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,519
Meixin Food Services

195
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,120
is the largest restaurant chain
in the country and has

196
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,240
(Boya and Meixin Food Services)
the highest annual seafood consumption.

197
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:48,840
(Signing Ceremony)
The signing ceremony begins now.

198
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:38,120
Hello, everyone.

199
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:41,480
I'm Na Wei.

200
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:46,440
The moment you saw Na Wei,

201
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,000
you knew this was your opportunity.

202
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,340
You decided to give
the most important performance

203
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:57,279
of your life.

204
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,120
I've been trying to figure out

205
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,399
who the third body in the fire was.

206
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,240
I see it now.

207
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:09,159
That's your only chance
to become Na Wei.

208
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:11,919
That day, you followed him

209
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,759
to Yong'an Village

210
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,080
and hid in my kitchen in advance.

211
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,200
You waited for a long time

212
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:30,360
until you heard him arguing
with my parents.

213
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:35,279
Give me a moment.

214
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:37,320
Let me get you the prescription.

215
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,639
Mr. Na Wei,

216
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:41,320
I know there's a misunderstanding

217
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,080
between you and my son.

218
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,440
He's an insensible young man.

219
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:48,480
Zhibai

220
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:51,039
is a good kid.

221
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,480
Na...

222
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,799
Mr. Na Wei.

223
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:52,080
I... I didn't...

224
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,159
Not me. I was just observing.

225
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,039
It's the art of experience.

226
00:13:58,039 --> 00:13:59,720
Not me. Don't...

227
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,440
Don't kill me.

228
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:10,240
Don't hurt my son.

229
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:33,320
Madam.

230
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:34,840
No.

231
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,600
Hello...

232
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:11,919
Hello...

233
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:14,759
Hello...

234
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,039
He...

235
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:34,440
Hello, everyone.

236
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:39,320
I'm Na Wei.

237
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,840
Are you all right, Sir?

238
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,759
Proceed as planned.

239
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,440
Do what you need to do.

240
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,080
You fired the gun

241
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,879
at someone who had your face.

242
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,320
How did it feel?

243
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,240
You killed him

244
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,639
and yourself.

245
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,639
From that moment on,

246
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,440
you became Na Wei.

247
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:53,399
For the next ten years,

248
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,840
you played the role flawlessly.

249
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,120
Not even his own son noticed.

250
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,640
The only flaw was the pen.

251
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,079
Even though you found
an identical pen later,

252
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,759
an imposter is still an imposter.

253
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,319
The pen concerned you.

254
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:22,920
It reminded you

255
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:30,519
that you're a faker.

256
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,440
Shut up!

257
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,720
4639, calm yourself.

258
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,680
Now I know why you killed my brother.

259
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,079
It wasn't because of Gai De.

260
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,000
It was because he discovered
you were a fake.

261
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:07,480
Right?

262
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,240
I didn't expect an old man like you
to have so much strength.

263
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,920
Where is my son?

264
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,400
Do you really care?

265
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:43,960
I found something

266
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,960
outside your house.

267
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,960
You sent a bunch of people
to save Gai De,

268
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:55,319
but they fired

269
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,220
before he even reached the safety zone.

270
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,839
That's why I think

271
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,880
you never cared about him at all.

272
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,559
But you can't.

273
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:07,920
You have to act like you do.

274
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,480
Just like now,

275
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,240
you're playing a father.

276
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:17,119
Just as I thought.

277
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:20,480
It's fine.

278
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,599
You're like every other parent

279
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:24,480
in this world

280
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,240
who never truly knows

281
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,880
what the children want.

282
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,599
They just offer blindly.

283
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:35,759
Because you think if you don't,

284
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,400
you don't deserve to be called a father.

285
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:43,079
Deep down,

286
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,240
you always wanted Gai De dead.

287
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,960
The longer he stayed alive,

288
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:53,160
the longer you had to keep up this act.

289
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,920
You're selfish.

290
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:05,480
You know nothing.

291
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,000
As a successful man in a patriarchy,

292
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:11,359
he must love his son,

293
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,319
even if it's inexplicable.

294
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:15,640
The core of his role

295
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:19,279
is being a loving father.

296
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:25,119
He can never love himself more
than his son.

297
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:33,960
He?

298
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,400
No wonder the DNA found on the pen

299
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:48,200
wasn't yours.

300
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,480
You're not Na Wei.

301
00:20:58,119 --> 00:20:59,359
You're an imposter.

302
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,200
I said shut up.

303
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:21,119
That explains why

304
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,759
you never appeared in public
all these years.

305
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,240
You also stayed away from your son.

306
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,040
You were scared of slipping up, right?

307
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,839
You made up

308
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:36,549
this ideology of patriarchy

309
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:38,740
and treated it as the foundation
for playing a father.

310
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,920
Do you even remember
what your own father was like?

311
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,620
Have you ever been a father yourself?

312
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,829
You haven't.

313
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,250
Yet you want to play a great father.

314
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,620
And worst, I saw right through you.

315
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,480
Your acting is terrible.

316
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:12,599
Didn't I tell you to shut up?

317
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:27,440
You're dying now.

318
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,839
Ashes cannot reignite.

319
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:37,759
But

320
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,559
embers can.

321
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,759
Clean up the body.

322
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,079
Get a few more men

323
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,640
to look into where he and his men

324
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,119
have been lately.

325
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,920
Find Gai De as quickly as possible.

326
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:17,279
I don't get it.

327
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,000
If you had admitted
that you weren't Na Wei to him,

328
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:27,519
all of this would've ended

329
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,039
instead of bringing us
to where we are right now.

330
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,519
But why?

331
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:53,960
Hello...

332
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,160
Hello...

333
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,400
Hello, everyone.

334
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,160
Hello, everyone.

335
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,359
Hello, everyone.

336
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,039
Hello, everyone.

337
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:12,279
Hello, everyone. I'm Na Wei.

338
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:13,640
Hello, everyone.

339
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,039
Who's there?

340
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,119
Hello, everyone.

341
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,640
I'm Na Wei.

342
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,519
This is the greatest performance ever

343
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:24,319
in your whole life.

344
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,519
I'm Na Wei.

345
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:57,599
There would have been

346
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,640
a time for such a word.

347
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:07,480
Tomorrow,

348
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:10,039
and tomorrow,

349
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:12,400
and tomorrow

350
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:15,880
creeps in this petty pace

351
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,240
from day to day,

352
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,480
to the last syllable

353
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,519
of recorded time.

354
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,759
It is a tale told by an idiot,

355
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,119
full of sound and fury,

356
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:43,279
signifying

357
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,319
nothing.

358
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:42,320
(Qi's Pharmacy)

359
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,720
I like this color.

360
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,119
I can wear it when I go shopping.

361
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:48,880
Wait.

362
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,279
I also need a pair of shoes

363
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:53,279
so I can walk comfortably in.

364
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,119
Any shoes?

365
00:27:58,119 --> 00:27:59,039
There you are.

366
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:01,880
Mei.

367
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,680
Come here.

368
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,119
Ms. Meihua.

369
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,000
Take a look.
See if there's anything you like

370
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,319
among these clothes and shoes.

371
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,400
Take them if you like something.

372
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,799
There are so many clothes.

373
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:14,240
You don't want them? They're all new.

374
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,310
The tags are still on.

375
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:16,319
Are you sure?

376
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,039
Yes, I'm very sure.

377
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:23,640
Are you moving or going on a trip?

378
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,440
Moving?

379
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:26,519
Where would I move?

380
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,920
I'm taking the two of them

381
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,720
on a trip to get some fresh air.

382
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,359
You should've done that a long time ago.

383
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,519
You see,

384
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:41,400
Xia

385
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:43,680
resigned from her job,

386
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,599
and Siyuan graduated.

387
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:49,359
You and Jin will look after the shop.

388
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,359
There's nothing for me to worry about.

389
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:56,079
Ample time and good sunshine.

390
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,000
I can enjoy whatever I like,

391
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,960
go wherever I feel like,

392
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,279
and come back

393
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,640
anytime I wish.

394
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,920
I'm envious.

395
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,519
Ms. Meihua,

396
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,960
when are you leaving?

397
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,640
I wish I could leave now.

398
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,440
But these two kids

399
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,160
said

400
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,359
today is my birthday.

401
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:22,559
They want to celebrate it at home.

402
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,519
They're good kids.

403
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,119
They're worthy of my love.

404
00:29:29,799 --> 00:29:30,480
Ms. Meihua,

405
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:32,759
you have these heels too.

406
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,200
I remember they were
highly sought-after back then.

407
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:40,640
They were a limited edition.

408
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,000
Only one color in each size.

409
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,920
I don't think you really want
to throw them away.

410
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:54,720
I'll put them away for you.

411
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,839
Throw them away.

412
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:09,359
All right.

413
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,119
I'm heading down.

414
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,720
This luggage contains clothes.

415
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,000
Note it down.

416
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,759
All right.

417
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:38,440
What did you buy?

418
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,660
You're carrying so many bags.

419
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,220
We'll go to the beach in a few days.

420
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,040
Ms. Meihua wanted me

421
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,640
to get some diving gear.

422
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,070
I told her they had everything,

423
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:46,559
but she insisted.

424
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,440
Macbeth?

425
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:58,160
Siyuan.

426
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:02,440
Siyuan.

427
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:05,880
Xia.

428
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:16,359
Okay.

429
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:21,680
Shu He says the results are in.

430
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,640
He contacted me.

431
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,720
Let's go together.

432
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,030
Wait for me in the meeting room.

433
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,039
Isn't that gun

434
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,200
Ms. Meihua's?

435
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,039
When I was performing the autopsy,

436
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,000
I found an old bullet

437
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,640
inside Zhibai's shoulder blade.

438
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:36,480
The technical department

439
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,359
identified the model quickly,

440
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,240
but that alone

441
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,440
wasn't enough to trace the exact gun.

442
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:48,319
You already have a suspect in mind,

443
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:51,440
don't you?

444
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,519
It wasn't until I realized

445
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:02,759
the gun that killed Tie Xin

446
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:05,039
was the same as the one
that killed Zhibai.

447
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,480
If we could fire

448
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,320
the same bullet with the suspicious gun

449
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:12,360
once again

450
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:15,079
and compare the bullet markings,

451
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,360
we'd know

452
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,360
if it's the same gun.

453
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,159
What did Shu He tell you?

454
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,880
He didn't say anything.

455
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,159
He just asked me to bring the gun over.

456
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:37,440
I didn't ask.

457
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:42,320
Anyway,

458
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,000
if the markings match,

459
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,119
he'll tell us everything.

460
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,280
If

461
00:34:58,239 --> 00:34:59,400
they don't,

462
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,239
that's good.

463
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:06,159
We can go home

464
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:08,000
and

465
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,320
celebrate Mom's birthday

466
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,599
and catch the flight
the day after tomorrow.

467
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,440
This is the ballistic report.

468
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:51,559
I mentioned it to you before.

469
00:35:51,559 --> 00:35:52,280
The case file

470
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:54,719
for the AH7 murder
from twenty years ago.

471
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,840
The statute of limitations has expired.

472
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,320
Read them yourselves.

473
00:36:27,896 --> 00:36:30,950
(The results are a positive match.)

474
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:53,480
(Wanted: Qi Meihua)

475
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:55,960
Can you give me half an hour?

476
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:00,360
Today's her birthday.

477
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,320
I promised

478
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,920
to make her a bowl
of prawn noodles with sesame sauce.

479
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,320
What's going on?

480
00:37:36,679 --> 00:37:37,559
You're home.

481
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,320
You two didn't answer my calls.

482
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:41,800
Did you get rained on?

483
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:43,400
Go change your clothes.

484
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,679
It's fine.

485
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,560
I'll make you a bowl of noodles.

486
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,320
Happy birthday,

487
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:31,639
Mom.

488
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,079
Thank you.

489
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,320
Where's Xia?

490
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:41,440
Maybe she's hiding somewhere
from the rain.

491
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:42,599
Give me a second.

492
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:44,519
There's a present for you.

493
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,559
A present?

494
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:01,630
When I was a kid,

495
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:03,719
I saw you and Mom wear them.

496
00:39:08,039 --> 00:39:09,320
They looked beautiful.

497
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,199
Try them on.

498
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:23,440
See if they fit.

499
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:30,760
Sure.

500
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,140
They fit perfectly.

501
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:47,840
Ms. Meihua.

502
00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:53,440
You're the real Na Wei.

503
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:01,360
