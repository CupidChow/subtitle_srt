1
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:43,920
What's the situation?

2
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,079
Early this morning,

3
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,520
a suspicious gift box was placed

4
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,110
right in the middle of the subway exit.

5
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,780
People found it strange and reported
it to the police. Go check it.

6
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,840
Evacuate the crowd.

7
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,740
Get the bomb squad in position
for inspection.

8
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,030
Scatter, people!

9
00:00:58,039 --> 00:00:59,640
Scatter now! Move along!

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,359
Scatter! Break it up!

11
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:02,479
Move along!

12
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:04,159
Move along!

13
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:30,640
It's not a bomb.

14
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:08,189

=The Embers=

17
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,870
According to
the Buhe Meteorological Bureau,

18
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,759
heavy rainfall is expected in the area

19
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:25,120
within the next two hours.

20
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,399
Reports indicate

21
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,120
that the downpour will last
for more than 48 hours.

22
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:33,010
(48 hours before Liao Zhibai's death)

23
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:20,920
Dad!

24
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,120
Dad!

25
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:25,399
Dad!

26
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,360
Open the door!

27
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,319
Dad!

28
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:31,879
Open the door!

29
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:34,680
The owner of this villa is Na Wei,

30
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:36,839
the founder and chairman of Boya Group.

31
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,820
In 2007, he was named Honorary President
of Buhe Chamber of Commerce.

32
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,399
Since arriving in Buhe in 2005,

33
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,310
he has acquired multiple businesses
in the food,

34
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:44,399
fruit, and beer industries.

35
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,480
His company's influence
spans import-export trade,

36
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,440
retail, real estate,
and several other sectors.

37
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,420
Over the past ten years,

38
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,720
he has contributed nearly 30 billion
in tax revenue to Buhe.

39
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,100
Because of his contributions,

40
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,320
he was personally received

41
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,340
by the Governor-General,
awarded a Knight's Medal,

42
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,980
and granted a special permit
for legal firearm possession.

43
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,160
I knew it had

44
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,879
to be someone with overwhelming power,

45
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:07,839
but I didn't expect it to be him.

46
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,480
It means

47
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,480
our enemy has finally
stepped out of the shadows.

48
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:18,160
(Gai De, Na Wei's son)

49
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,340
To save his son, Gai De,
Na Wei ordered Tie Xin

50
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,040
(Tie Xin, Na Wei's subordinate)
to carry out the arson ten years ago.

51
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,060
(Liu Haixun, PIC of dried fruit factory)
For tipping them off,

52
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,460
Liu Haixun ended up joining
Tie Xin's ranks and was promoted,

53
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,600
becoming the owner
of the dried fruit factory.

54
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,300
(Mr. Liao)
A decade ago,

55
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,399
my father led a drug
manufacturing operation,

56
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:37,000
which included

57
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,820
(Song En, Nu Na - Subordinates)
Song En, Nu Na, and Tai Shu.

58
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,280
(Tai Shu, subordinate)
Their direct contact was Tie Xin.

59
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,680
(Tie Xin, Na Wei's subordinate)
But the true mastermind behind it all

60
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,740
was Na Wei.

61
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:46,880
(Na Wei, President of Chamber)

62
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,860
(of Commerce)
It means

63
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,040
Na Wei wasn't just the kingpin

64
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,560
of my father's drug network.

65
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,720
He was also the one who orchestrated

66
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,500
the fire to cover up
the murder committed by Gai De.

67
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,079
Sir, should I...

68
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,639
They found me.

69
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,519
They've got what they wanted.

70
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:35,639
They won't kill anymore.

71
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:39,160
All they want is to force me
to show myself.

72
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,040
The moment we lose our
composure and open that door,

73
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:46,639
confirming my relationship with Gai De,

74
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,720
we'll be at a disadvantage.

75
00:07:52,317 --> 00:07:58,390
(Na Wei)

76
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:00,399
Wait a little longer.

77
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,759
Once they step onto the villa grounds,

78
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,360
it'll all be over.

79
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:06,639
Dad!

80
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:09,240
Open the door!

81
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:17,759
If you hate me,

82
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,720
why did you bring me to the world?

83
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:28,519
A man like him,

84
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,759
does he even have a weakness?

85
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:33,120
He's got all the money

86
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,480
and power he could ever want.

87
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,080
I don't know about anything else,

88
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,840
but one thing is certain,

89
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,440
he loves his son.

90
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,180
Or he wouldn't have orchestrated

91
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,590
the fire ten years ago to save him.

92
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,399
Drive over.

93
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,039
Let's take him back.

94
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:49,759
Gai De is still useful.

95
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,120
Warning!

96
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,060
You have entered
Mr. Na Wei's private estate.

97
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,400
It is protected under a decree
issued by the Governor-General.

98
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,160
Leave now, or you'll
bear the consequences.

99
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:18,399
Notify the Cleaner.

100
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,980
Tell him to get here
as soon as possible.

101
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,559
It's almost over.

102
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,960
I'll cover you guys! Grab him!

103
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,519
Go! Go!

104
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,960
We have to save him!

105
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:27,480
Su Taipu!

106
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,039
Go!

107
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:30,639
Don't come back!

108
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,279
Go!

109
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,240
Daddy hasn't come home in two days.

110
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,080
Nuo Li,

111
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:51,480
the rain is pouring so hard.

112
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:54,519
Do you think Daddy forgot his umbrella

113
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,919
and can't make it back?

114
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,559
Here.

115
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,919
My sincerest apologies, Officer.

116
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,840
Mr. Na Wei is overwhelmed with grief.

117
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,820
He just took his medication
and has fallen asleep.

118
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,560
He cannot see anyone right now.

119
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,910
A murder just happened here

120
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:01,279
hours ago.

121
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,480
This is not a trivial matter.

122
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,320
He must cooperate
with the investigation.

123
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,360
Mr. Na Wei has a special exemption
from the Governor-General.

124
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:10,159
Even with a search warrant,

125
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:11,879
you cannot enter as you please.

126
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,919
He's probably awake now.

127
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,200
We don't need to go in.

128
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,700
Just have him come out

129
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,240
and come with us for questioning.

130
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:33,919
That's not possible.

131
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,039
Director,

132
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,000
we're outside Na Wei's residence.

133
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,380
Finish processing the crime scene
and pull back immediately.

134
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,420
But Na Wei...

135
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,000
Orders came

136
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:57,879
from above.

137
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,600
Do not disturb Mr. Na Wei's rest.

138
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:01,360
Follow orders.

139
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:05,200
Yes, sir.

140
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,320
Let's go.

141
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,280
Breaking news.

142
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,140
A shooting occurred
in front of the residence

143
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,380
of renowned businessman Na Wei,

144
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,390
resulting in one fatality.

145
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:25,550
This incident, along with the
recent Shen Congxin case,

146
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,790
has reignited discussion about
the unsolved case of Ti Yi.

147
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,660
Sources suggest
that the true culprit behind it

148
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,690
may be Gai De, founder
of  Zhenmei Art Training Hub.

149
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:33,190
For a decade,
Gai De has been shielded

150
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,340
by powerful forces willing
to cover for him at any cost.

151
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,740
According to an inside source,

152
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,780
Gai De is suspected
to be Na Wei's illegitimate son.

153
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:41,280
As of now, Na Wei and law
enforcement have declined to comment.

154
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:42,880
(28 hours before Liao Zhibai's death)

155
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:44,440
(28 hours before Liao Zhibai's death)
Liao Zhibai has to be arrested.

156
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,000
(28 hours before Liao Zhibai's death)
He's alive.

157
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,140
What does that tell us?

158
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,700
It means the forensic report
from back then was falsified.

159
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:53,080
Truth behind the Liao family fire case
is also compromised.

160
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:53,960
And if we dig further,

161
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,580
the Ti Yi case had
a questionable autopsy report too.

162
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:57,960
These two cases are connected.

163
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,540
We have to investigate them thoroughly.

164
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:02,679
The forensic examiner
responsible for both cases

165
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:03,360
was Xu Sheng.

166
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:04,799
She has turned himself in.

167
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,260
We're preparing to interrogate her.

168
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,240
Director,

169
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,679
a single forensic examiner

170
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:11,200
couldn't have pulled this off alone.

171
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:15,720
Shu He,

172
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,559
I know what you're thinking.

173
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,879
But do you know who Na Wei is?

174
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,360
With his influence in
both politics and business,

175
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:24,240
if we act without solid evidence,

176
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,840
we'll only make

177
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,919
this situation even more uncontrollable.

178
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,660
Do you understand?

179
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,279
His security guard
shot and killed Su Taipu.

180
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,840
It's enough to get me a search warrant.

181
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,300
It happened on his private property,

182
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,519
and he has a legal firearm permit
issued by the Governor-General.

183
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,000
If this goes to court,

184
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,399
at best, they'll charge him
with excessive self-defense,

185
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,720
and the only one who'll do time
is the bodyguard.

186
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,159
This won't legally
tie back to Na Wei at all.

187
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:53,789
So what?

188
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,420
We just sit here and do nothing?

189
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:04,720
Mr. Na Wei,

190
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,860
what brings you here in this heavy rain?

191
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,080
Please, have a seat.

192
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,320
My private residence

193
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,159
was invaded by armed criminals.

194
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,340
An innocent civilian
was critically injured.

195
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,390
And he's missing.

196
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,480
Now, there are baseless rumors

197
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,039
spreading everywhere, slandering me.

198
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,480
I trust the police department,

199
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,640
but after waiting an entire night,

200
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,519
I haven't seen a single arrest warrant.

201
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,840
So, how could I not come here myself?

202
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,399
Mr. Na Wei,

203
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:47,080
I completely
understand your frustration.

204
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:49,360
But this situation escalated suddenly.

205
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,120
Our entire department

206
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,399
has been working non-stop

207
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:54,399
since last night.

208
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,840
We've set up roadblocks at every exit

209
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,759
out of the city.

210
00:16:58,919 --> 00:16:59,559
Rest assured,

211
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,120
we will capture

212
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,080
Liao Zhibai as soon as possible.

213
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,279
As soon as possible?

214
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,079
Yes.

215
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:08,680
How soon?

216
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:14,240
If I don't see results in 24 hours,

217
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:17,660
I'll call Central Police Command
and file a formal complaint.

218
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,279
Then we'll see if your current position

219
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,960
should be filled
by someone more competent.

220
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,200
I will handle this immediately.

221
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,680
Mr. Na Wei, please wait.

222
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,279
Who are you?

223
00:17:57,599 --> 00:17:59,759
Shu He, Chief of the Buhe
Criminal Investigation Unit.

224
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,180
How can I help you?

225
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,240
I want to ask

226
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,960
about your relationship with Gai De.

227
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,039
We have substantial evidence

228
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,030
proving that Gai De was
the real perpetrator

229
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,980
behind a rape and murder
case from ten years ago.

230
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,799
The case has now been reopened.

231
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:17,759
Since the suspect is missing,

232
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,200
we have the right to notify his family
to assist in the investigation.

233
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,480
I'll ask you one more time,

234
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,720
what is your relationship with Gai De?

235
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,200
I have no relationship with him.

236
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,160
I only care about
his safety and well-being.

237
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,420
As for whatever crimes
he may have committed,

238
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,000
I know nothing.

239
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:42,160
Of course,

240
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,880
if he really did break the law,

241
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,000
you're free to handle it
however you see fit.

242
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,900
But at the very least,
I want to see him first.

243
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,880
Please understand.

244
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,119
Arrest Liao Zhibai as soon as you can.

245
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:55,240
Trust me. I want to find him
even more than you do.

246
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,640
Looking for me?

247
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:11,270
Your police station's security
is still as terrible as ever.

248
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,780
No wonder even
a USB drive could go missing.

249
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,640
It's been ten years, Mr. Na Wei.

250
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,640
We finally meet.

251
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:22,599
Liao Zhibai?

252
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:40,319
Mr. Na Wei,

253
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,640
that pen in your pocket,
it's quite elegant.

254
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,599
I remember this brand
has a unique feature.

255
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,039
Every leaf engraved on the pen cap

256
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,440
is handcrafted,

257
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:54,079
making each piece

258
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:56,279
in the world one of a kind.

259
00:19:58,359 --> 00:19:59,240
I looked into it.

260
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:02,400
Gai De gave it to you
when he was a child, didn't he?

261
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,160
And?

262
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,720
Officer,

263
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,119
I'm here to turn myself in,

264
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,960
and while I'm at it,
I'd like to file a report.

265
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,960
I am formally accusing Mr. Na Wei

266
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:21,279
of murder, arson, framing,

267
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,119
and orchestrating
the Liao family fire ten years ago.

268
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:25,960
Do you have proof?

269
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:27,400
I am the proof.

270
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:30,519
The fact that I'm still alive
and standing here

271
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,720
means the forensic report

272
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,839
from the fire was falsified.

273
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,559
And I have this.

274
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:43,440
This pen

275
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:46,039
is the real murder weapon
that killed my parents.

276
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,519
Not only does it have their blood,

277
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,119
but it also carries
Na Wei's fingerprints and DNA.

278
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:57,200
Everything I just said

279
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,720
is documented in the case files.

280
00:20:58,759 --> 00:20:59,680
You can verify it.

281
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,880
Nonsense.

282
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,109
Well, we won't know

283
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:04,180
if it's nonsense
until the tests are done, will we?

284
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,680
Are you scared?

285
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,640
Since when do suspects

286
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,100
get to dictate investigations?

287
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:22,200
Throwing out accusations,
and interfering with others, huh?

288
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,300
Just because you say
it should be tested, I should comply?

289
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,319
This is a self-incrimination trap.

290
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,720
As a responsible businessman,

291
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:33,720
I refuse to set

292
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,319
such a dangerous precedent.

293
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,200
Is that so?

294
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,279
Then let's wait.

295
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,620
Wait until you decide
it's time to test it.

296
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:53,640
Hello.

297
00:21:58,359 --> 00:21:59,160
What did you say?

298
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,680
Breaking news. Five minutes ago,
we received an anonymous exposé

299
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,109
directly linked to the drug
trafficking vehicle explosion case.

300
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:14,960
It alleges that Na Wei is involved
in drug manufacturing and trafficking,

301
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,200
supplying narcotics
in exchange for favors and profits.

302
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,920
It includes
high-ranking political figures,

303
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,900
and social personalities.

304
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,730
We've turned the list
over to law enforcement.

305
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:23,220
Now it's under official investigation.

306
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:27,720
We spent ten years

307
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,720
getting that list.

308
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,839
Now that this has blown up,

309
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,900
everyone on it
is too busy saving themselves.

310
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,020
No one will care about Na Wei anymore.

311
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,359
As long as he takes the DNA test,

312
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,040
that's irrefutable evidence.

313
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,160
No one will be able to save him.

314
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,680
Ten years...

315
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,580
And it's finally coming to an end.

316
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,440
Once things settle in the next few days,

317
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:03,319
I'll figure out a way
to retrieve Su Taipu's body

318
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,079
and bury him next to his wife.

319
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,359
As for Jiu,

320
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:09,440
I've been thinking.

321
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,240
It's inconvenient for her to stay

322
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,160
with grown men like us.

323
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:15,279
I'll find a good family for her.

324
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,920
Someone who can take her in
and give her a better life.

325
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:21,319
And then, we will...

326
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:31,920
If this works,

327
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:33,559
Zhibai won't be coming back.

328
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:37,200
What did you just say?

329
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,000
This money is split into three shares.

330
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,240
One for each of you,

331
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,240
and the last one for Jiu.

332
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,200
After tonight,

333
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:00,240
we go our separate ways.

334
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,960
It's been a long road.
Thank you for everything.

335
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:16,359
Keep my share.

336
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,559
I don't want it.

337
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,799
Looks like you've changed
your mind, Mr. Na Wei.

338
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,759
I figure if I walk out of here today,

339
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,200
even if the law declares me innocent,

340
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,519
public opinion won't let me go.

341
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,079
That's fine.

342
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,279
Let's run the test.

343
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,160
Let the truth

344
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:05,440
speak for itself.

345
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,960
I don't trust you.
I'm not handing it over to you.

346
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:20,880
What about me?

347
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,400
Can you trust me?

348
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,279
Of course.

349
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:21,920
Qi Xia.

350
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,660
You are fully responsible
for handling the evidence testing.

351
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,240
Yes, sir.

352
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:42,960
Leave it to me.

353
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:56,130
(22 hours before Liao Zhibai's death)

354
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,839
Is this enough?

355
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,640
Or should I give you more
to make sure the results are accurate?

356
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,820
Please step outside
and wait for the results.

357
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,079
Long time no see.

358
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:03,279
I have to say, I'm jealous.

359
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,319
You look great in that uniform.

360
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,920
It suits you.

361
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:14,680
You were always the one
more suited to be a police.

362
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:20,000
How did you survive back then?

363
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:23,599
Does it matter?

364
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,319
What matters is

365
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:30,599
that this time,
you have to keep me alive.

366
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,759
Don't let me die again.

367
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,720
Where did you get the pen?

368
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:54,519
From forensic examiner Xu Sheng.

369
00:29:58,079 --> 00:29:58,880
Yes.

370
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:03,920
Back then, a man named Tie Xin
contacted me.

371
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,680
As for who he was working for,

372
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:11,880
I really don't know.

373
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:14,920
He approached me twice.

374
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,599
Once for the Ti Yi case,

375
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,839
and once

376
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,000
for the Liao family fire.

377
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:32,599
I know

378
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,759
I was a police officer,

379
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:39,799
bound by duty and responsibility.

380
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:43,640
But...

381
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,519
But at the time, I had no choice.

382
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:53,559
They kidnapped my family.

383
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,200
Held my elderly parents
hostage to force my hand.

384
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,519
I'm sorry.

385
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,240
I'm not saying this

386
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,000
to excuse myself.

387
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,799
Later,

388
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:26,000
at the crime scene, I found that pen.

389
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:30,519
When I compared it
to the fatal wounds on the bodies,

390
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:33,799
it matched the murder weapon.

391
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,640
So I took a risk.

392
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:39,720
I hid it.

393
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:45,680
Until Liao Zhibai found me.

394
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,510
You hid that evidence
for so many years.

395
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:52,759
Why give it to him now?

396
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,559
Tie Xin is already a wanted man.

397
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,920
What do I have to be afraid of anymore?

398
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:04,599
Actually,

399
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,880
I haven't had

400
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:12,400
a peaceful night's sleep
in over a decade.

401
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,559
I knew

402
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,400
that because of me,

403
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:23,440
the real cause of death
of the Liao family

404
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:26,279
was buried for ten years.

405
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:28,759
Because of me,

406
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:33,559
Liao Zhibai was forced
to live in disgrace.

407
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,240
Then,

408
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,119
Qi Xia became my apprentice.

409
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:48,160
She's

410
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:51,440
so young, so pure,

411
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,720
and so full of promise.

412
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:58,000
Every single day working beside her

413
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,119
was torture for me.

414
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,799
I don't deserve to be her master.

415
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:14,559
I don't even deserve
to be a police officer.

416
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:23,839
But today,

417
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,000
I'll finally be able to sleep.

418
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,920
When I first found Xu Sheng,

419
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,920
I told her

420
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,880
that Tie Xin was bound
to be put on the wanted list.

421
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:39,759
Then came the highway explosion.

422
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,920
Tie Xin was exposed,

423
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,440
and the police issued a warrant for him.

424
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,880
That's when I earned
the first shred of her trust.

425
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:49,480
After that, I promised her

426
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,750
that I would do everything in my power

427
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:53,759
to keep her family safe.

428
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:58,279
And I used her guilt against her.

429
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:00,599
That's how I got the pen.

430
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:03,559
But

431
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,640
taking down Na Wei

432
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,630
with just a pen is nearly impossible.

433
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,000
Think about it,

434
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:18,559
his wealth, his status,
and his connections...

435
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,360
All of it shields him.

436
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:26,960
But what if he loses all of that?

437
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,360
Investigate Na Wei thoroughly!

438
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:31,480
Hold all involved officials accountable!

439
00:34:31,559 --> 00:34:33,360
Give the people the truth!

440
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,680
Investigate Na Wei thoroughly!

441
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,159
Hold all involved officials accountable!

442
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,360
Do you hear that?

443
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:40,119
Investigate Na Wei thoroughly!

444
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,079
Hold all involved officials accountable!

445
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,360
Give the people the truth!

446
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,630
Investigate Na Wei thoroughly!

447
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,599
Hold all involved officials accountable!

448
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,440
Give the people the truth!

449
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:50,599
You gave the list to the TV station?

450
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,000
Yes.

451
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:54,800
Or why do you think
he suddenly agreed to cooperate?

452
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:57,119
Even I didn't expect

453
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,079
things to go this smoothly.

454
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,719
Guess we should thank God for it.

455
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:12,039
God can't save you.

456
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:15,190
The only one who can
help you is yourself.

457
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:22,719
Tell me, where is Gai De?

458
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,599
As soon as Na Wei is convicted,

459
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,280
I'll hand him over myself.

460
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,199
Liao Zhibai...

461
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,400
Shu He.

462
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,880
You can't save me.

463
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,800
The fire ten years ago

464
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,840
already burned me to ashes.

465
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:58,599
All that's left of me now is embers.

466
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,039
I just want to use the last of my heat

467
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,639
to illuminate the truth.

468
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,800
So just let the wind carry me away.

469
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:16,920
The results are in.

470
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,119
It's not Na Wei.

471
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:45,880
That's impossible.

472
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,320
There must be a mistake.

473
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,320
Qi Xia locked the forensic lab herself.

474
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:54,040
She ran the tests
over and over, all night.

475
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,380
The entire process was recorded.

476
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
This is the result.

477
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:00,960
The fingerprints and DNA

478
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,880
don't match.

479
00:38:04,519 --> 00:38:05,360
You were wrong.

480
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:43,320
I'm not wrong.

481
00:38:44,408 --> 00:38:52,320
(18 hours before Liao Zhibai's death)

482
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:18,400
Sir,

483
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:19,639
the fire pit is ready.

484
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,760
Sir,

485
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:40,239
