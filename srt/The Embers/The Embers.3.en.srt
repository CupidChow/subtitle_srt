1
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,120
Please come in.

2
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:21,039
This way.

3
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,879
Here are my details.

4
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:36,820
This is really impressive.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,709
Well,

6
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,000
we need a detailed medical report

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,600
for your study abroad application.

8
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:42,080
Please take a seat for a moment.

9
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:42,790
Okay, thanks.

10
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,320
I'll make the preparations.

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,790
Is the ovarian stimulation
procedure done?

12
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:27,319
Almost done.

13
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,480
This time,
we need to retrieve more eggs.

14
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,140
Otherwise, we would have to do it again

15
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:32,799
if there were empty follicles.

16
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:34,480
Got it, no problem.

17
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,580
One more thing,

18
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,079
we'll livestream Mei's surgery

19
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,719
for the sponsor later.

20
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:39,560
Okay.

21
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:50,640
Can anyone help me?

22
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,480
Help! Anyone here?

23
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:55,920
Help!

24
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,280
Please help!

25
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:01,799
Help me.

26
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,300
- What's wrong?
- Please help me.

27
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,070
Help me.

28
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,640
Pal.

29
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,960
Help her.

30
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:22,159
Help!

31
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,479
Help!

34
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:17,920
Chief,

35
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:18,920
let's go.

36
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,750
Officer, how about a drink?

37
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,639
No, thanks.

38
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:22,959
When did you meet Lai La?

39
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,439
I don't know Lai La.

40
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,600
Didn't I already explain this
to you last time?

41
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,040
Last night,

42
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:44,399
there was a massive fire
at a hotel called Innocence.

43
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,430
The flames were intense.

44
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:48,600
But luckily,

45
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,079
the hotel's surveillance system

46
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:52,920
wasn't damaged.

47
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,839
That's great news.

48
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,439
Yeah, it sure is.

49
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,060
It captured footage of you and Lai La.

50
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:16,040
Okay, I did know Lai La.

51
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,600
But not that long.

52
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,399
About a year or so.

53
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:24,360
Then why did you lie earlier?

54
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,079
I just didn't want to get involved.

55
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,199
I don't know anything

56
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,720
and can't provide
any useful information.

57
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,120
I was worried

58
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,519
if the police started suspecting me,

59
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:42,279
wouldn't that get me into trouble?

60
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,000
Take a look and see
if you recognize this suitcase.

61
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:54,560
Of course, I do.

62
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:56,160
It's mine.

63
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,500
I lost it a couple of days ago.

64
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,720
Did you guys find it for me?

65
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,079
On the night of the 4th, at 8 PM,

66
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:06,639
Lai La entered Room 501.

67
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,920
An hour later,

68
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:10,319
you dragged this suitcase into the room.

69
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:13,079
Between 9:30 and 10:30 PM,

70
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:15,759
there were two noise complaints
about that room.

71
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,079
Room 502 reported

72
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:19,240
public disturbance due to loud arguing.

73
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:21,720
Around 3 AM,

74
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,360
you left the hotel with this suitcase.

75
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,160
But the security footage

76
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,439
never captured Lai La leaving.

77
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:32,367
(Hallway Footage)

78
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:33,120
Two days later,

79
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,040
Lai La's head was found
at Jade and Gemstone Market.

80
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:37,199
Two days after that,

81
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:39,560
her body was discovered in the river

82
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,120
inside your suitcase.

83
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:49,000
I see.

84
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,439
You're suspecting me.

85
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,079
But can I ask you something?

86
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,680
Did you find

87
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:06,920
my fingerprints, skin tissue,

88
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,959
DNA, or other evidence

89
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,040
on that suitcase?

90
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,020
I don't think you found any.

91
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,640
If you had,

92
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,220
the police would've called me in
for questioning a long time ago.

93
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,480
Besides, I'm not a citizen here.

94
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,879
You can't arrest me
without evidence, right?

95
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:36,960
Then explain

96
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,879
why the body was found in your suitcase.

97
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:39,759
Someone

98
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:42,159
is obviously trying to frame me.

99
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,159
Who would frame you?

100
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,519
And why?

101
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,039
All right.

102
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,399
I'll be honest with you.

103
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,320
Lai La did ask me to meet her
at the hotel that night.

104
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,300
Did you call me here only

105
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:43,279
to ask for money?

106
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,240
Shouldn't I be asking you for money?

107
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:01,919
When I woke up,

108
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,200
she was gone.

109
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,960
So I thought she must've left.

110
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,200
That's why I went home.

111
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:11,440
That's it.

112
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,500
Then why did you bring a suitcase
to the hotel?

113
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:24,000
For some stuff.

114
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,840
What stuff?

115
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,360
Toys.

116
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,080
What kind of toys?

117
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:36,320
Whips, ropes, and handcuffs.

118
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:37,279
Are you serious?

119
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,240
Are those really toys?

120
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,120
The whip...

121
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,440
It's just a fetish.

122
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,860
That's not illegal, is it?

123
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,080
It's not.

124
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,360
But Lai La was pregnant.

125
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:02,039
Won't it be fatal to play like that?

126
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,080
A girl with loose morals

127
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:10,279
like Lai La?

128
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,360
Getting pregnant

129
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,480
isn't exactly surprising, is it?

130
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:25,240
She was still a student.

131
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,100
I have my eyes on you now.

132
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,080
Take care, officer.

133
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,360
We checked with the hotel front desk.

134
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,159
Liao Siyuan was after you.

135
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:22,090
(Qi's Pharmacy)

136
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:26,799
Oh, don't be mad.

137
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:27,879
I was only kidding.

138
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:30,039
I'm just saying it's a possibility.

139
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,860
Because if we follow what I taught you

140
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,750
about the fundamental
principles of deduction,

141
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:35,320
this is the logical outcome.

142
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,200
You said it yourself.

143
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,630
The most important part of the deduction
is the premise.

144
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:39,640
The premise!

145
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,700
If it is uncertain,
the conclusion isn't absolute.

146
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,560
You said so yourself!

147
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,590
Would you kill our parents

148
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:44,200
and do drugs?

149
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,399
I get your point.

150
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,720
Do you think

151
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:48,440
I want to suspect myself?

152
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,720
I've been trying to figure out

153
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,080
what happened before that day

154
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:54,679
and why I can't remember anything.

155
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,680
So what?

156
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,080
I don't remember anything either.

157
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,390
Then isn't that exactly

158
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,039
why we need to find out now?

159
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,759
Yes.

160
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,200
But Siyuan,

161
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,080
deduction requires precision and logic.

162
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:11,480
We can't let emotions cloud
our judgment.

163
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:13,120
Because once we do,

164
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:14,840
we start twisting the facts

165
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,000
to fit our theories.

166
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And that's wrong.

167
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:20,399
So if you're not mentally prepared

168
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,080
to face the worst possible outcome,

169
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,920
then we might as well
stop investigating now.

170
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,790
And what could be
the worst possible outcome?

171
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:30,480
What...

172
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,639
What's the matter?

173
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:44,919
Are you okay?

174
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,519
My son,

175
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,200
you and that...

176
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:08,399
Look at me when I'm talking to you.

177
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,960
You and that...

178
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:16,559
You know, that girl.

179
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,960
Did you two

180
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,639
have a thing?

181
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:21,320
No.

182
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:23,600
No?

183
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:26,679
Then you must have had a crush on her.

184
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,200
No, there's nothing between us.

185
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,680
No relationship at all.

186
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:45,960
If there's none,

187
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,240
then it's for the best.

188
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,039
Move in a little.

189
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:57,279
Ah, my head.

190
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:57,919
Siyuan,

191
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:00,960
love and personal gain

192
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,039
are the most important things in life.

193
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,799
If neither exists,

194
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:10,000
there's no point at all.

195
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,120
Do you understand?

196
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:16,279
Are you really going

197
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,440
to risk your life over this?

198
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,279
What about me and your sister?

199
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:28,000
Don't even try to reason with me.

200
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,000
I don't understand,

201
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,200
and I don't want to listen it.

202
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:32,759
Truth, justice,

203
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,320
or whatever.

204
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,480
I don't get all that

205
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,639
and I don't care.

206
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,000
All I want is for our family

207
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,440
to be happy

208
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,840
and live our lives in peace.

209
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:57,600
Do you hear me?

210
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:02,720
All right, I'll stop.

211
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,269
Get up and have some fruit

212
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,400
to replenish vitamin C.

213
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:07,399
Hurry up and eat

214
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,200
before it goes bad.

215
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,440
Ms. Meihua may act careless
most of the time.

216
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:20,519
But she really cares about you.

217
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,750
The crime scene was burned down.

218
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,600
So that means the killer couldn't wait

219
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,720
to destroy the evidence.

220
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,840
The clinic is closed.

221
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,120
Could Song En be hiding?

222
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,240
I don't think so.

223
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,519
The window isn't locked.

224
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,160
Why are all the patients women?

225
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,340
Have you ever seen medical records
that look like resumes?

226
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,559
What's this?

227
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,359
Prices?

228
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:56,400
It's Lai La.

229
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,240
The autopsy confirmed
Lai La was pregnant.

230
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,030
If Song En's relationship with Lai La

231
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,680
wasn't what we initially thought,

232
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,599
that means he used his position

233
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:07,799
as a doctor

234
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,400
to lure young female students
into prostitution.

235
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,520
Siyuan, pick that up.

236
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:24,279
Cai Na and Lai La?

237
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:25,480
Who's Cai Na?

238
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,820
The girl who jumped off
the school building not long ago.

239
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,319
(A girl, pregnant, suicide...)

240
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,039
Could Cai Na's death

241
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,380
also be connected to Song En?

242
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,359
This is bad.

243
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,320
What took you so long to come back?

244
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,839
I've already played several rounds.

245
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:37,279
The clinic was closed.

246
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:40,340
Yet, you couldn't wait
and broke into my clinic.

247
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:42,680
You must be really sick.

248
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:44,519
You're right.

249
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,079
I keep seeing someone standing

250
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:50,720
right next to you.

251
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,920
I suspect he's the one who set the fire.

252
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,300
He may have changed his clothes.

253
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,520
But he didn't change his shoes.

254
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,680
These shoes are brand new.

255
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,319
But one edge has noticeably stiffened.

256
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:01,640
That's from gasoline damage
to the leather.

257
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:05,599
Siyuan, he has a gun.

258
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,900
Besides destroying the evidence,
he wants to kill you too.

259
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,200
Do your mom and sister know

260
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:12,440
you're here?

261
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:16,079
No.

262
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:20,799
But the 300 viewers
in my livestream do.

263
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,420
There are 350 viewers now.

264
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,880
(A university student takes you
into the home of a deranged killer!)

265
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:34,839
This is an act of defamation.

266
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,960
I'm not even a suspect.

267
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,079
Viewership, that's all.

268
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,799
If you are a killer, I get popularity.

269
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,480
If you're not, I'll just leave.

270
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,000
Kid,

271
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:46,880
never joke

272
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,920
about this just for views.

273
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,920
You make a good point.

274
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:54,960
I'll back off then.

275
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:55,960
Sorry, everyone.

276
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,839
I got it wrong.

277
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,420
I'll give you guys a boost tomorrow.

278
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,750
Has anyone ever told you

279
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:03,200
that you and your brother look alike?

280
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:10,000
Too bad.

281
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,519
If my brother were still alive,

282
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:16,079
Lai La's killer would already be
in prison.

283
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:17,759
Yeah, too bad

284
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,440
that he's dead.

285
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,079
But I'm still alive.

286
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:42,920
Xun.

287
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,280
It's been a long time.

288
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:47,920
Who told you to activate this phone?

289
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,680
Things are getting complicated
on my end.

290
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:56,160
The cops are onto me.

291
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,839
You have to help me.

292
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:00,160
Why does that concern me?

293
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,279
Bye.

294
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:02,160
Xun, wait.

295
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:04,079
Don't hang up, Xun.

296
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:07,119
This isn't just about me.

297
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:08,799
Also, I suspect...

298
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,440
I suspect Liao Siyuan knows.

299
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:17,799
Stay on the line.

300
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:26,400
Boss,

301
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,599
Song En called.

302
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,480
(Liu Haixun)
He mentioned Liao Siyuan.

303
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,720
After all these years of keeping
that bait,

304
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:34,759
it looks like it's finally useful.

305
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,830
What could a university student
possibly know?

306
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,519
Draw out the one
who should've died a long time ago.

307
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:40,920
Yes, Boss.

308
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:43,599
Song En, listen to me.

309
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,200
From now on,

310
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:47,480
do what I instruct you.

311
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,440
Got it?

312
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,160
You're using me as bait

313
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,279
to lure someone out.

314
00:23:58,559 --> 00:23:59,839
I could die here.

315
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:02,240
Do you think not following orders

316
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,359
will keep you alive?

317
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,720
Don't forget.

318
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,240
I could protect you ten years ago.

319
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,760
I can do the same again today.

320
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,200
Just do as I say.

321
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,680
This is Cai...
Cai Na's ex-boyfriend, Mike.

322
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,799
I know a bit about Lai La's situation.

323
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,160
I will answer everything you ask.

324
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:47,279
I want to know

325
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:51,319
why Cai Na jumped to her death.

326
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:53,759
I'm not too sure about this.

327
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,780
But it certainly had nothing
to do with our relationship.

328
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,880
Why did you two break up?

329
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,000
At first,

330
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,680
my relationship
with Cai Na was very stable.

331
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,559
But there was a time

332
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,880
when Cai Na and Lai La spent
a lot of time together.

333
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:18,799
After that, Cai Na suddenly
became desperate for money.

334
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,279
She even borrowed a lot from me.

335
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,680
I couldn't take it anymore

336
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,720
so I broke up with her.

337
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,680
I have one more question.

338
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:31,039
Do you know where Cai Na lived?

339
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,039
Please come in.

340
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,039
This is Cai Na's room.

341
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:51,119
After she died,

342
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,000
none of the arrangements
in this room were changed.

343
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,400
I come in to clean every day.

344
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,400
Seeing these things

345
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,960
makes me feel like Cai Na

346
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:08,960
is still alive.

347
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:14,680
This bed...

348
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,200
This is Lai La's bed.

349
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,519
She and Lai La became really close
in high school.

350
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:26,000
Later, when Lai La ran away from home
to escape an arranged marriage,

351
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,160
she stayed here for a long time.

352
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,740
She ran away from an arranged marriage
during high school?

353
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:37,759
Yes.

354
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:40,240
She was still a child.

355
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,680
I can still remember

356
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,880
what she looked like that day.

357
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,200
Cai Na!

358
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:00,880
Cai Na!

359
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,720
Cai Na!

360
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,000
I thought you went home.

361
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,160
Why are you...

362
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,240
I have no home to go back to.

363
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,799
- Lai La!
- Let me go!

364
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:28,319
Lai La!

365
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:28,920
Come here!

366
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:30,400
Lai La. Lai La.

367
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,359
Be good and get changed.

368
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,839
The groom's family will be here soon.

369
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:34,519
No!

370
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:36,599
Hey!

371
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,319
What are you doing?

372
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:42,799
I still want to go to school.

373
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,319
What's the point of studying?

374
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,720
Lai La,

375
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,680
you were born here.

376
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,039
So you have to follow the rules here.

377
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,599
The women in our town get married

378
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,440
when the time comes.

379
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,279
Lai La, be good.

380
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,559
Put that down.

381
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:02,920
Don't do anything foolish.

382
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:07,920
Lai La.

383
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,319
I would rather die than come back!

384
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,079
Don't do it, Lai La!

385
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,000
Come in.

386
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,400
Come here.

387
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,799
We'll buy a new bed tomorrow

388
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:02,599
and place it there.

389
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,039
You can stay as long as you want.

390
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:07,559
This will be your home from now on.

391
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,300
But wouldn't it be too much trouble
for you?

392
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Of course not.

393
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:15,559
Thank you.

394
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,359
Don't mention it.

395
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,839
Come on, cheer up.

396
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:20,200
Put on a smile.

397
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,680
Hello, Lai La.

398
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,240
The streetlights here are broken.

399
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,839
Can you come and get me?

400
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,920
What's in your bag?

401
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:45,759
Weapon.

402
00:29:58,319 --> 00:29:59,839
She never talked

403
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:03,079
about her family.

404
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:04,440
We never asked either.

405
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:07,440
But a few days ago,

406
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,880
I ran into Lai La's parents by chance

407
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:13,000
when I went to school
to pack up Cai Na's things.

408
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:16,920
That's when I found out the kind of life

409
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,039
she had been living for over ten years.

410
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:25,880
That poor child.

411
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,720
She came into this world

412
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:30,960
only to suffer.

413
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,599
Lai La is now gone.

414
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,440
These are the few belongings she left,

415
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,440
with no one to even sort them out.

416
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,200
After what happened to Lai La,

417
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,680
we also suspected
that Cai Na didn't take her own life.

418
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,200
But we don't have the means
to investigate.

419
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,119
So I'll leave this information to you.

420
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,320
(Cai Na's egg retrieval
and tube removal records.)

421
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:14,759
Mrs...

422
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:16,359
I know what you want to ask.

423
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:21,119
We may not be rich.

424
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:21,920
But

425
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:24,400
we never

426
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,640
let Cai Na worry about money.

427
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:31,319
I don't even know

428
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,440
why she did something so foolish.

429
00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:41,519
She could have told me about everything.

430
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,359
Siyuan,

431
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,359
do you remember
the records of those girls

432
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:12,039
we found at Song En's clinic?

433
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,599
At first, I thought

434
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,079
they were linked to prostitution.

435
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,960
So that was a catalog?

436
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,319
If Cai Na was selling her eggs,

437
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,160
then Lai La's unborn child could be...

438
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,220
A surrogate pregnancy.

439
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,279
Song En runs a clinic on the surface.

440
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,279
But behind the scenes,

441
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,160
he's illegally exploiting young girls
for egg harvesting and surrogacy.

442
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,790
This might be connected

443
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:39,200
to Lai La and Cai Na's deaths.

444
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:42,100
We need to report this
to the police immediately.

445
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:43,400
I'll call my sister now.

446
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,759
The results are in.

447
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:54,079
Lai La and the baby

448
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:55,200
have no biological relation.

449
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,480
So it really was surrogacy?

450
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:00,400
It looks like Siyuan was right.

451
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,799
We need to arrest Song En
as soon as possible

452
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,599
before more girls get hurt.

453
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,420
I want you guys

454
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,119
to gather the files
on every missing woman in Buhe.

455
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:21,829
Track every financial

456
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,100
transaction linked to Song En.

457
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,160
I'll request a warrant for his arrest.

458
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,079
Be on standby.

459
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:27,240
Ready to move at any time.

460
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,420
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

461
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,710
Split up, cover both stairways
and head up.

462
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:14,639
Move out.

463
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:15,159
Yes, sir.

464
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:16,840
Break the door down!

465
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,239
Break it down now! Break it!

466
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,119
Chief.

467
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:21,400
Chief!

468
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,159
Chief!

469
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,599
Give that to me!

470
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,880
Break this door!

471
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:06,480
Chief!

472
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:08,199
Freeze!

473
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:09,079
Police!

474
00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:12,360
Chief.

475
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:15,519
Where's Song En?

476
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,000
He's out to kill Liao Siyuan.
