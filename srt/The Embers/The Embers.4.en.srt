00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,880
Three, two, one.

00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:27,760
Lai La.

3
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:29,679
I've never left the house

4
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,239
after 10 PM.

5
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:34,759
This is my first beer.

6
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:37,840
Try it out.

7
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,200
What do you think?

8
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:01,280
It tastes awful.

9
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:03,719
Same here.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,879
But who cares?

11
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,280
That's another tick on the bucket list.

12
00:01:10,814 --> 00:01:13,850
(Lai La and Cai Na's bucket list)

13
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,680
(Grab our first beer as adults.)
Done and done.

14
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,879
We've finished a whole page.

15
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:23,319
Time for some new wishes.

16
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,799
Is there anything you'd love to try?

17
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,560
I want to see snow.

18
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,159
I've never seen snow before.

19
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,359
Too bad it's never going to snow here.

20
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,079
Okay.

21
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,879
I'll start a part-time job
when I go to college.

22
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:44,159
I'll work hard

23
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:47,000
and take you to Russia,

24
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:48,920
Hokkaido,

25
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,560
and also Mudanjiang.

26
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,079
I'll show you all the snow in the world.

27
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:57,159
Great.

28
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,879
We'll both make a ton of money

29
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:02,439
and travel across the world.

30
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,960
We'll watch the snow together.

31
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:31,960
Cheers.

32
00:02:35,084 --> 00:02:39,350
(We'll watch the snow together.)

35
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,860
Let's play poker sometimes.

36
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:46,959
I'm busy.

37
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:48,839
What do you want?

38
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,279
The person you abducted

39
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,680
was not Liao Siyuan.

40
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,160
You sent us the photo
of that electric bike.

41
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,480
Xun only ordered us to give you a hand.

42
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,160
Okay.

43
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,600
What's going on here?

44
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,180
(1 Hour Ago)
I want to pay my respects to Lai La.

45
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,519
Take my bike.

46
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,220
Light some joss sticks for me.

47
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:51,720
Call Liao Siyuan.

48
00:05:54,044 --> 00:05:55,720
(Qi's Pharmacy)

49
00:05:58,565 --> 00:06:00,970
(Incoming call: Ma Luo)

50
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,360
Hello? Ma Luo?

51
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,120
Did you pay your respects?

52
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,360
Save some joss sticks for yourself.

53
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:09,759
Unless you want your friend dead,

54
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:13,639
meet me on the roof
of Jialan Tower in ten minutes.

55
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:15,600
I'm warning you.

56
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,120
No tricks.

57
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,879
If you call the police,

58
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,120
I'll cut your friend up

59
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:23,720
into thin slices

60
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,680
like a piece of pork!

61
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,480
Yongli Tower and Jinhu Tower
across the street

62
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,720
can see Jialan Tower's roof.

63
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,160
Snipers, find a vantage point.

64
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:38,879
Move in.

65
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,830
Once you locate Song En,

66
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:41,000
I'll lead a team inside.

67
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,510
Is the fire brigade ready?

68
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:43,720
They are on the way.

69
00:07:06,038 --> 00:07:08,370
(Jialan Tower)

70
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:19,759
Reporting in.

71
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:21,079
Song En hasn't shown up.

72
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:24,680
Liao Siyuan reached the rooftop.

73
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,839
Say hi to your dear friend.

74
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:57,879
Come on.

75
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,879
Song En,

76
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,120
curse you!

77
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,510
Track the signal.

78
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,360
Yes.

79
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,680
You played dirty!

80
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,240
You're a loser!

81
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm at the place.

82
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,000
Where are you now?

83
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,720
I think I'm at...

84
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,920
Why should I tell you our location?

85
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,240
I'm the one you want.

86
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,680
Just tell me what you want.

87
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,959
I told you a long time ago.

88
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,120
The smart ones don't live long.

89
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,040
What do you want?

90
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,320
Relax.

91
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,840
Let me show you something fun.

92
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,879
Isn't that fun?

93
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,480
Exhilarating, isn't it?

94
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:00,559
What a surprise, am I right?

95
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:05,080
I told you not to call the police,

96
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,279
but you did anyway.

97
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:11,279
It seems like you don't
really care about your buddy.

98
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:13,639
Now, look at him.

99
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,720
We've been made.

100
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,799
I only wanted a chat.

101
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,860
But you just had to
make things ugly for all of us.

102
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,360
Well then,

103
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,060
you may go to hell now.

104
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,159
I'll do as you say.

105
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,240
Let Ma Luo go.

106
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,600
What do you want from me?

107
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:39,360
Jump down from where you stand.

108
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,159
Chief, the fire brigade is here.

109
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,080
It's going to take two minutes

110
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,279
to inflate the air mattress.

111
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,159
Two minutes...

112
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,000
Look! He's going to jump!

113
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm dying anyway.

114
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,320
Just tell me.

115
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,960
Why did you kill Cai Na and Lai La?

116
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,279
Worry about yourself.

117
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:37,399
It wasn't easy to make it this far.

118
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,200
I'm never letting you ruin it for me.

119
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,159
I know it.

120
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:45,080
I know you've done nasty things
to set me up.

121
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:47,919
How dare you stand there

122
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:48,840
and loathe me

123
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:50,320
while playing the victim?

124
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:56,519
You'll suffer the same fate
as Liao Zhibai.

125
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,039
As great as he was, it was pointless.

126
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,159
He messed with the wrong man.

127
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,200
He deserved to die in that fire.

128
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,679
There was a fire at my house
ten years ago.

129
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,159
Was it your doing?

130
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:15,399
You have 30 seconds
to jump off the roof

131
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:16,799
unless you want your buddy

132
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,879
to be sliced in halves

133
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:19,960
like a piece of meat!

134
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:24,440
Can you guarantee

135
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:27,120
Ma Luo will be safe

136
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,200
if I do as you say?

137
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,679
Why should I guarantee anything?

138
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,559
Ten!

139
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:50,320
Wait.

140
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,480
Don't take me for a fool.

141
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:56,159
The rescue team brought an air mattress.

142
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,639
I want you to move to the north side

143
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,000
of the roof!

144
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,279
Five!

145
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,559
Four!

146
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:04,679
Target located.

147
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:05,399
Team One, move in!

148
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:09,279
Three!

149
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:15,799
Two!

150
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:22,000
One!

151
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,480
A young man

152
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,480
fell off Jialan Tower

153
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,500
and died from the drop.

154
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,840
It's been told that the deceased
studied early childhood education.

155
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:49,440
Where is Song En?

156
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,080
Where is Song En?

157
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,720
This is my fault!

158
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,919
Liao Siyuan died because of me.

159
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:01,279
It was...

160
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:04,159
It was all because of me!

161
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,080
Hello, officer.

162
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,039
The deceased is my friend.

163
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,440
May I know

164
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,519
when I can

165
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:34,080
see him again?

166
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:35,480
Who do you mean?

167
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,440
The man who jumped off the building,

168
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,399
Liao Siyuan.

169
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:41,559
Liao Siyuan?

170
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,639
Oh, I remember now.

171
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,960
Processing the body

172
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,279
isn't a simple task.

173
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:47,720
Wait for our call.

174
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,080
We'll contact you
if we have any updates.

175
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,080
Hello?

176
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:33,720
Liao Siyuan is dead.

177
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,519
The one you anticipated never showed up.

178
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,039
I'm leaving Buhe.

179
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,840
You did a great job.

180
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,000
He is very pleased.

181
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:42,759
Go into hiding.

182
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,960
Leave the rest to us.

183
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:46,159
Rest easy.

184
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,559
Very well.

185
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,360
Sir,

186
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,440
perhaps we overcomplicated things.

187
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,679
If he was alive,

188
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:04,240
he'd make a move.

189
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:08,919
How much does Song En
know at this point?

190
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,240
Basically nothing.

191
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,159
However, he was a small part

192
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:14,519
of the fire from years ago.

193
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:13,879
Who is it?

194
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:17,559
Who are you?

195
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:19,159
Who are you?

196
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,960
My identity is not your concern.

197
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,840
More importantly,

198
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,639
I planted something inside your belly.

199
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:30,879
It's the same thing
you did to those girls.

200
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,279
What did you

201
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,200
put inside me?

202
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,759
What is it?

203
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,240
Some adorable little creatures.

204
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:49,720
Stay still.

205
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,639
They might crawl out of you.

206
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,960
Who are you?

207
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,799
Who are you?

208
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,759
Are you that eager to find out?

209
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,240
So be it.

210
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,319
Officer.

211
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:36,599
Are you arresting Song En?

212
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:37,359
Take me with you.

213
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:38,480
It's a city-wide manhunt.

214
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,119
Go home.

215
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:40,319
We'll keep you posted.

216
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:40,880
Wait...

217
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,000
Go on, I'll take you there.

218
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:14,279
A ghost!

219
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,440
No way!

220
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,620
The police station is haunted!

221
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:25,960
Coming or not?

222
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:31,400
Where to?

223
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:33,119
Siyuan...

224
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:36,519
I know I owe you my life.

225
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:37,519
I'll have to repay you.

226
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:39,079
But...

227
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:41,039
Just give me a few days.

228
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:43,400
Wait until I've avenged you.

229
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,440
Catch this.

230
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:50,640
Isn't this yours?

231
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:55,279
You're alive?

232
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,319
Siyuan! Are you alive?

233
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,680
We run a fake charity organization.

234
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:05,640
We target girls
from underprivileged families.

235
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:09,200
We use overseas scholarships as a front

236
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,880
to control them.

237
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:14,960
We force them...

238
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,599
into prostitution.

239
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:21,400
If they are highly educated,

240
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,960
young, and pretty,
they will be forced to sell their eggs.

241
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,640
Then, we look for healthy
surrogate mothers.

242
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:30,880
Chief.

243
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:33,680
We found a thumb drive in the safe.

244
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,200
I printed out the files.

245
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,960
This is a price list.

246
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,319
Yes.

247
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,279
It's 2,000 USD per night.

248
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,279
Each egg is 5,000 USD.

249
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,640
The service of each surrogate mother
is 150 grand.

250
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,750
We even give them the full recording...

251
00:19:56,759 --> 00:19:57,400
Enough.

252
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,839
Do you know Lai La?

253
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:09,799
Yes.

254
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:13,200
She came to Song En's clinic.

255
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,359
Song En thought she looked
young and healthy.

256
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:18,160
He was going to lure her in,

257
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:19,599
but she wasn't interested

258
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:20,880
in studying abroad.

259
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,960
She only worked part-time
to save up money.

260
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,400
Our usual method didn't work on her.

261
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:28,759
Our plan failed.

262
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:30,799
However,

263
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:34,319
she introduced Cai Na to us.

264
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,920
What about the child Lai La was bearing?

265
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:44,200
That happened afterward.

266
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,119
One day, Song En asked me

267
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:49,119
to conduct a surgery.

268
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,960
I only knew it was Lai La
when I got there.

269
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:53,960
We are terribly sorry about Cai Na.

270
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:56,680
She had great genes.

271
00:20:58,799 --> 00:20:59,599
What a shame.

272
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,480
I don't have a suitable
surrogate mother.

273
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:05,039
After much pondering,

274
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,559
you are the best candidate.

275
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,640
I don't know the specifics.

276
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:16,720
In other words,

277
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,200
Lai La was carrying Cai Na's child.

278
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,119
Yes.

279
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,599
Why did Song En kill Lai La?

280
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,119
No idea.

281
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,799
When we first learned
about Lai La's death,

282
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:46,559
I could tell

283
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,839
Song En was shocked.

284
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,319
It wasn't easy finding
a suitable surrogate mother.

285
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,140
He was hoping to use Lai La
to make a fortune.

286
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:00,119
I doubt he killed Lai La.

287
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:02,200
Can you prove it?

288
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,599
Tell us if you have evidence.

289
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:07,589
All evidence tells us

290
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:08,520
Song En was the killer.

291
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,640
And now you're saying
he didn't kill the girl?

292
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,680
We are about to close the case.

293
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,400
I can't prove it,

294
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:19,160
but my guts tell me that.

295
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:20,880
I mean it.

296
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,960
I'm telling you the truth.

297
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,400
Recently,

298
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,109
the Buhe Police Department
has cracked an operation

299
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,900
that abducted and trafficked
young women.

300
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,000
A total of 16 women were rescued.

301
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,759
The mastermind, Song En,
is still at large.

302
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:42,880
We hope

303
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,400
the citizens come to the police
should they have any info.

304
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,079
For those

305
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,160
who provide valuable info and directly
assist in the criminals' arrests,

306
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,279
the police are putting out
a reward of 500 grand.

307
00:22:57,799 --> 00:22:58,720
Are you still upset?

308
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
You're a grown man.

309
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,200
So, grow up.

310
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,640
I bet you think you're tough now.

311
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,000
Tough as a rock, maybe.

312
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:10,480
You even faked your death.

313
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,599
What a genius.
Amazing work back there.

314
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:15,960
I did it for Lai La and Cai Na.

315
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:17,799
I did it for the innocent girls.

316
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,680
Back then,

317
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,279
we knew we could crack the cases.

318
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:23,880
This case is on a different level.

319
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,559
I have you to back me up.

320
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,240
But not forever.

321
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:30,720
What are you going to do when I'm gone?

322
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,279
That day will never come.

323
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:33,000
What if it comes?

324
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,640
No "if".

325
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,319
Just imagine it.

326
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:34,880
I can't.

327
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,079
Fine, live long and prosper.

328
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:36,640
Thanks.

329
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:38,680
What if it happens?

330
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,960
You have to keep yourself safe.

331
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:40,660
When I'm gone,

332
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,830
I'll be worried about you.

333
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:44,440
Liao Siyuan!

334
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:47,400
We've been looking for you.

335
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,680
Here you are.

336
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:50,400
What is this about?

337
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,400
What else could it be?

338
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:53,559
I watched the video a million times.

339
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:55,240
You clearly jumped off the building.

340
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,160
How did you survive?

341
00:23:58,279 --> 00:23:59,279
Don't you get it?

342
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,400
There's no scratch on him.

343
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,559
He clearly put up an act
with the police's help.

344
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:06,039
It was a ruse?

345
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,480
But a bunch of people saw the body.

346
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:12,759
Haven't you watched movies?

347
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,400
Are those bodies real?

348
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:15,839
Yeah.

349
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,960
The whole process wasn't
that different from a movie.

350
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,780
I concluded that Song En
wouldn't show up in the area.

351
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,510
He wanted to see me jump,

352
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:29,340
but he can only watch
through the surveillance cameras.

353
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,359
Wait.

354
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:34,039
Don't take me for a fool.

355
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,279
The rescue team brought an air mattress.

356
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:37,920
The police played along.

357
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:39,960
The IT team switched out
the footage.

358
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,519
Five!

359
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:41,599
Four!

360
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:42,799
Three!

361
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:43,599
Cut the signal.

362
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:44,109
Two!

363
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:44,640
That way,

364
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,070
the footage Song En watched

365
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:47,759
was a mannequin we prepared.

366
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,590
The crowd was
actually police officers.

367
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:51,740
Qi Xia prepared the blood
and bits of the brain.

368
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:54,079
But what's the deal with Song En?

369
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:55,880
He clearly killed the girls.

370
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:00,279
Why does he insist I set him up?

371
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:01,960
What?

372
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,440
Don't be so naive.

373
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,480
Why would you trust a killer?

374
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,119
Siyuan.

375
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:12,480
Given the circumstances,

376
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,279
if Song En still thought you set him up,

377
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:20,480
is it possible that someone else
was behind all this?

378
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,799
Could it be that he didn't kill Lai La?

379
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,480
Siyuan,

380
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:28,720
I think we need Xia

381
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,740
to do us another favor.

382
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:39,039
You want me
to examine Lai La's body again?

383
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:39,960
Yes.

384
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,000
I think the killer
could be someone else.

385
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:44,880
Siyuan,

386
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,759
this shouldn't be your concern.

387
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:50,559
I only want the truth Lai La deserves.

388
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,510
Every piece of evidence
is pointing towards Song En.

389
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,960
But, if Song En didn't kill her,

390
00:25:56,279 --> 00:25:58,079
it means the real killer
is still out there.

391
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,119
But I examined the body.

392
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:01,279
Well, do it again.

393
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,720
The living can lie,

394
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:05,359
but not the dead.

395
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,680
I think your profession

396
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,960
is cooler than mine.

397
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:10,640
The living can talk,

398
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,519
but they also lie.

399
00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:13,960
The dead can't even say a word.

400
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:19,119
My scalpel can make them talk.

401
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,839
Awesome.

402
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:21,839
Qi Xia?

403
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,559
Qi Xia?

404
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,359
I'll update you later.

405
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,510
I'm examining the body.

406
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:34,039
Now?

407
00:26:50,414 --> 00:26:53,040
(Both examinations
came back with the same result.)

408
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,400
Dr. Qi.

409
00:26:57,839 --> 00:26:59,440
The Crime Scene Unit

410
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,000
found another injector.

411
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,119
It has Lai La's

412
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:03,119
and Song En's DNAs on it.

413
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:15,200
Well?

414
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:17,759
Nothing wrong with the body.

415
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:19,559
But the Crime Scene Unit

416
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:20,759
found a new batch of evidence

417
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:22,240
in Song En's clinic.

418
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,759
There is an injector

419
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:25,880
with the deceased's DNA

420
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,160
and Song En's fingerprints.

421
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:34,200
In other words,

422
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,960
Song En injected Lai La with the drug

423
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,519
forcefully.

424
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,759
The evidence is solid,

425
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,750
but it doesn't fit
the psychological profile.

426
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,599
If Song En really did it,

427
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:47,400
why didn't he destroy the injector

428
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,000
right afterward?

429
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:53,039
Maybe Song En
was unaware of its existence.

430
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:54,799
Someone was setting him up?

431
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:57,680
That would be too obvious.

432
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,920
Indeed.

433
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,359
And effective too.

434
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,799
By finding the injector,

435
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:05,880
the police can use it
to convict Song En.

436
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:13,279
I've been to Lai La's house.

437
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:16,200
It's different from the picture.

438
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,359
How so?

439
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,759
I can't say for sure.

440
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,200
It's the carpet.

441
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:39,640
See?

442
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:41,119
In the picture,

443
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,400
there is a carpet over here.

444
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:44,559
It's not gone.

445
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,440
Xia.

446
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:52,839
That floor panel

447
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:54,279
has less wear and tear compared

448
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:55,240
to its surroundings.

449
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,440
The color has a nuanced difference.

450
00:28:57,599 --> 00:28:58,480
The color difference

451
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,319
takes a long time to form.

452
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:00,880
Therefore,

453
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,880
there had been a carpet here
for a long time.

454
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,160
It's the carpet.

455
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,559
But the carpet looks new
in this picture.

456
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,240
Why was it thrown away?

457
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:14,599
It must be because it was smudged.

458
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,680
Smudged?

459
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,880
Ask Xia

460
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,079
if the police detected any blood
with Luminol.

461
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,160
Xia, did you use Luminol...

462
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:22,839
Yes.

463
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,119
We found no bloodstain,

464
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:25,960
so we eliminated

465
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,060
the possibility that
this was the first crime scene.

466
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:29,680
Maybe there was bloodstain

467
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:31,920
on the carpet,

468
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,880
and it was thrown away.

469
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,079
Maybe the body was dismembered
on the carpet.

470
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,640
If that was the case,

471
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,480
there would be bloodstain.

472
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,440
Xia is right.

473
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:46,720
Do a more thorough search.

474
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,079
Xia,

475
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,279
over here.

476
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:09,640
What is it?

477
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,200
Over here.

478
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,359
The splash and its angle

479
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,559
match our hypothesis.

480
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,599
I'll take a sample.

481
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:20,839
Siyuan,

482
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:23,599
if that is Lai La's blood,

483
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,920
then we've been mistaken all along.

484
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:28,240
Siyuan,

485
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:30,359
remember when I told you

486
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,070
that there were two possible reasons
for cutting off Lai La's head?

487
00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:36,079
One, the killer wanted
to provoke the police.

488
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,440
Two, the killer has a weird fetish.

489
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,599
But there could be a third cause.

490
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,880
Maybe Lai La asked for it.

491
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:45,720
She took her own life.

492
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,880
Song En!

493
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:19,599
Are you still in pain?

494
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,000
This is nothing

495
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,039
compared to the pain
those girls went through

496
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,839
when the needle extracted their eggs!

497
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:28,839
Lai La!

498
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:31,200
Lai La!

499
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:33,559
Is that you?

500
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:34,759
Is that you?

501
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:35,880
You still remember me.

502
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,839
I'm already dead.

503
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:44,119
Where are you?

504
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,079
Tell me where you are.

505
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,839
Show yourself.

506
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:51,680
I'm right inside your stomach!

507
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,240
Cursed killer.

508
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,960
You're a murderer!

509
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,960
I'll never stop haunting you!

510
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:12,920
Go away!

511
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:14,680
Go away!

512
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:15,880
Go away!

513
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:17,799
Go away!

514
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:26,519
Buhe Police Station.

515
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:30,200
You found him?

516
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,680
Where?

517
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:38,839
I want to turn myself in.

518
00:32:39,319 --> 00:32:40,200
I can't be here!

519
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:41,440
I can't be here!

520
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,519
I'm turning myself in!

521
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:46,920
I want to turn myself in!

522
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,920
Lock me up!

523
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,200
I can't be here! I'll die here!

524
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,799
I'm going to die!

525
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,590
I'm turning myself in.

526
00:33:02,764 --> 00:33:06,200
(In Operation)

527
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,599
What's the deal now?

528
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,599
A private clinic called the police.

529
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,599
When we arrived,

530
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,660
we learned
that Song En called the police.

531
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:18,920
He was lying on the ground.

532
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:20,319
He kept rambling about

533
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:21,480
unforgivable crimes

534
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:22,440
and turning himself in.

535
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,660
And then, he called us.

536
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,200
And his stomach?

537
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,030
Before coming to the hospital,

538
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,839
Song En cut his belly open.

539
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:32,279
He said the thing inside him

540
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:34,640
was Lai La.

541
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,720
Your family runs a pharmacy.

542
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:56,079
Why are you coming to my place?

543
00:33:56,279 --> 00:33:58,160
Look at the amount of pills.

544
00:33:58,279 --> 00:33:59,400
He's not getting better.

545
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,720
Because the doctor says so.

546
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,120
Is this the last prescription?

547
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:03,839
Probably.

548
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:07,599
Ms. Qi!

549
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,320
Ms. Qi!

550
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:15,239
Ms. Qi!

551
00:34:16,039 --> 00:34:16,639
I...

552
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:18,960
I...

553
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,239
Ms. Qi!

554
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:23,960
My goodness!

555
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:24,760
What do you want?

556
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:28,159
Ms. Qi, it's me.

557
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,400
Who?

558
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,159
I'm Song En.

559
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,159
I'm Song En.

560
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:35,840
Ms. Qi, it's me!

561
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:37,639
You have the audacity

562
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:39,199
to come looking for me?

563
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,880
I'll make you pay!

564
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,519
Mom!

565
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:43,559
You hurt my son!

566
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,679
He has a gun!

567
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,679
He's carrying a big gun!

568
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:47,199
Go!

569
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:47,920
Calm down.

570
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,639
You'll pay for your crime!

571
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:52,119
Calm down. He's insane.

572
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,199
Insane?

573
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,239
Are all people so fragile these days?

574
00:34:57,199 --> 00:34:58,280
He went insane that easily?

575
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:00,320
Calm down. Relax.

576
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,480
Xia,

577
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,030
does he get a lighter sentence
if he's insane?

578
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,039
Is he faking it?

579
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,159
I bet he's faking it

580
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:08,480
to get a lighter sentence!

581
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,679
All right, let's go.

582
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:10,599
He hurt my son!

583
00:35:10,599 --> 00:35:11,599
I'll make him suffer!

584
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:12,159
Fine.

585
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,639
Ms. Meihua was amazing.

586
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,039
She is a true hero.

587
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:25,559
She beat Song En so hard
that he couldn't speak.

588
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,880
Why would Song En suddenly come back

589
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,199
to turn himself in?

590
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:33,360
Haven't you heard?

591
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,440
He said there was someone
in his stomach.

592
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,070
They found a cell phone in him

593
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:38,480
at the hospital.

594
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:40,199
That is so weird.

595
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,719
Maybe he went insane.

596
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:45,159
I doubt we can get
anything else out of Song En.

597
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:50,199
Hello? Xia?

598
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:52,440
Siyuan, I have the test result.

599
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:54,960
The bloodstain under the couch
was Lai La's.

600
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,840
Her home was likely
the first crime scene.

601
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,519
Very well. I got it.

602
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:15,079
That's where she hid the truth.

603
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,559
Lai La.

604
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:51,480
I know

605
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:53,800
you have a soft heart.

606
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,000
But after going through so much,

607
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,679
you've gotten used to your facade.

608
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,159
Now,

609
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:03,199
repeat after me.

610
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:05,119
I am brave.

611
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,440
I am brave.

612
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,760
I have a kind heart.

613
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,360
I have a kind heart.

614
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:16,880
I'm not what they think I am.

615
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,639
I'm not what they think I am.

616
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:26,280
We can realize our dreams.

617
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:29,360
Really?

618
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:30,920
Trust me,

619
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,079
we can.

620
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,159
Anything you'd love to do?

621
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,719
Three, two, one.

622
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,500
When I go to college,

623
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,620
(We'll watch the snow together.)
we'll travel to watch the snow.

624
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:45,150
Okay.

625
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:54,880
Sweetheart,

626
00:37:55,559 --> 00:37:56,960
you have to help me.

627
00:37:57,159 --> 00:37:58,880
I'll be dead if I don't pay up.

628
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:00,039
Please.

629
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,000
Why do you want to study abroad?

630
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:04,679
Because of Mike.

631
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,599
He wants to study abroad.

632
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,199
I don't want to leave him.

633
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,199
I saved up the money from working.

634
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,400
I was going to use it

635
00:38:12,519 --> 00:38:14,039
for our snow-watching trip.

636
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:15,079
And this too.

637
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,679
I heard this charity organization

638
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:18,559
helps underprivileged students
study abroad.

639
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:19,880
Outstanding.

640
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,679
You got either an A or A+
in every subject.

641
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,639
How about this?
I'll give you the best price.

642
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:27,039
I must head back now.

643
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,719
Sorry.

644
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:31,719
During the egg extraction,

645
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:34,719
we had a small accident.

646
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,000
You can never conceive a child again.

647
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,679
If you call the police,

648
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,559
I'll post the videos
and photos online.

649
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,360
Your mom will get a copy too.

650
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,639
Thanks for looking after me.

651
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:08,119
I'll talk to Song En.

652
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,000
No!

653
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,000
I can't let my mom see those videos.

654
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,230
I'm only asking for two things.

655
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:23,400
One, give me the money.

656
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:24,920
Two,

657
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,199
sleep with me

658
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:28,159
when I say so.

659
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:30,320
How did you get the photos?

660
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,400
You're working with Song En.

661
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,480
You set me up.

662
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,639
If you leave now,

663
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:38,039
I'll jump!

664
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,800
Go ahead!

665
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:40,800
Jump now.

666
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:13,519
Think about it.

667
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,079
If you could

668
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:17,360
give birth

669
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,600
to your best friend's child,

670
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:20,559
wouldn't you be doing her a favor?

671
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,199
If you call the police,

672
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,199
all of your friends at school

673
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:26,480
will see Cai Na's video.

674
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:47,239
Cai Na,

675
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:49,760
I'll be there in a moment.

676
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:31,199
Liao Siyuan!

677
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,560
Liao Siyuan! Have you lost your mind?

678
00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:38,760
Liao Siyuan, what do you want?

679
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,480
How big was the debt?

680
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:46,119
How much did Cai Na help you pay back?

681
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,239
What money? You must be drunk.

682
00:41:49,239 --> 00:41:50,039
Move aside.

683
00:41:53,159 --> 00:41:54,480
Cai Na and Lai La...

684
00:41:56,039 --> 00:41:57,280
Why did they die?

685
00:41:57,719 --> 00:41:58,760
None of my business.

686
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,039
Why are you asking me?

687
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,239
They are dead because of you!

688
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:09,280
Don't deny it!

689
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:22,519
So what?

690
00:42:24,039 --> 00:42:25,119
Did I commit a crime?

691
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:27,440
Are the police arresting me?

692
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:29,599
Who do you think you are?

693
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:37,679
Don't you feel sorry
for what happened to Cai Na?

694
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:39,679
Yeah. I intoxicate myself every day.

695
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:40,239
I regret it...

696
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:41,239
The two of them

697
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,559
struggled for so long

698
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:44,760
in their miserable life.

699
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:46,960
When they finally caught
a glimpse of light,

700
00:42:47,559 --> 00:42:48,760
you smothered it

701
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,079
like it meant nothing.

702
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,480
Mike,

703
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:53,960
does love mean anything to you?

704
00:42:54,519 --> 00:42:56,159
Do their lives mean anything to you?

705
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,519
You should be haunted by nightmares
after what you did!

706
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,280
Listen up.

707
00:43:06,519 --> 00:43:08,239
I have the charm to get it done.

708
00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:10,880
Cai Na may be dead,

709
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,920
but countless girls are still out there.

710
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,559
They don't matter.

711
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,199
Life is about

712
00:43:17,159 --> 00:43:18,159
being happy.

713
00:43:25,719 --> 00:43:27,199
Spare me the righteousness.

714
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:29,710
How did you fall for
that good-for-nothing Lai La?

715
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,639
Stop it!

716
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,559
(Before I die,)

717
00:44:57,639 --> 00:44:59,199
(I want to see him again)

718
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,119
(with my real face.)

719
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:22,159
Siyuan,

720
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:23,920
time to hit the sack.

721
00:45:27,199 --> 00:45:28,639
Were there other accomplices

722
00:45:29,719 --> 00:45:31,480
in Lai La's suicide?

723
00:45:34,039 --> 00:45:36,079
Why would there be accomplices?

724
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:38,239
If there were, it wouldn't be a suicide.

725
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,039
Your voice changes when you lie.

726
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,440
I'm not lying to you.

727
00:45:54,239 --> 00:45:56,039
I don't want you to lose yourself.

728
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,559
The mastermind hid Lai La's head
inside a rock

729
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,480
to maximize its impact on society

730
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,190
and eventually take down Song En.

731
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:06,630
Now that Song En has

732
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:08,239
turned himself in as a madman,

733
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,159
it's clear

734
00:46:09,639 --> 00:46:11,199
that the mastermind wants it to end.

735
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:13,440
Further investigation

736
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,110
would only bear the same result.

737
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,519
If Lai La and Cai Na

738
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:25,800
were still alive,

739
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,440
what would they be doing?

740
00:46:33,131 --> 00:46:37,200
(Qi's Pharmacy)

741
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:55,199
I've never seen snow before.

742
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:59,480
Too bad it's never going to snow here.

743
00:47:00,519 --> 00:47:02,599
I'll start a part-time job
when I go to college.

744
00:47:03,039 --> 00:47:03,960
I'll work hard

745
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:07,320
and take you to Russia,

746
00:47:08,039 --> 00:47:08,880
Hokkaido,

747
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:09,880
and also Mudanjiang.

748
00:47:10,679 --> 00:47:12,400
I'll show you all the snow in the world.

749
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:17,079
Okay.

750
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:18,519
Cheers.

751
00:47:19,239 --> 00:47:22,000
We'll make a ton of money together

752
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:23,719
and travel to so many places.

753
00:47:32,539 --> 00:47:38,800
