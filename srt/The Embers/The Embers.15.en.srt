1
00:00:11,733 --> 00:00:13,342
(You once told me)

2
00:00:15,004 --> 00:00:17,685
(that you have a curse.)

3
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:22,719
They described it in vivid detail.

4
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:26,000
(Year 2005)
They even know how many moles you have.

5
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:27,359
I see it now.

6
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,519
You're an unfaithful tramp.

7
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:32,719
No wonder your family doesn't want you.

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,000
No.

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,119
No?

10
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:36,759
No? You can say whatever you want.

11
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,600
Tramp.

12
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,479
You don't believe me anyway.

13
00:00:56,679 --> 00:00:58,719
Let's just get a divorce.

14
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,840
Divorce?

15
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,640
Divorce me so you can hook up

16
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:02,840
with others openly?

17
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,719
You wish.

18
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,100
Look at you being all flirty.

19
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,100
Look at you dressing so flirtatiously.

20
00:01:26,797 --> 00:01:29,780
(A curse of being slandered
throughout life.)

21
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:47,760
Ke Xin.

22
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,000
Something happened.

23
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:50,990
Your husband was working
on the construction site

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,300
and fell off the scaffolding.

25
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,920
There's so much blood.

26
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,599
He's definitely beyond saving.

27
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:58,239
Ke Xin.

28
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,359
Ke Xin.

29
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:00,519
Can you come out?

30
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:02,680
You should go and have a look.

31
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:05,400
Ke Xin...

32
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,079
Are you okay?

33
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,719
Trust me.

34
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,120
I'll get you out of here.

35
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:44,919
We'll go to a place without curses.

36
00:04:10,314 --> 00:04:21,010
=The Embers=

37
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,090
=Episode 15=

38
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,319
Anything suspicious?

39
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,860
I keep feeling
like something isn't right.

40
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,279
This should be it.

41
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:58,639
According to Na Wa,

42
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,100
the motive for murder is established

43
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,940
and the chain of evidence is complete.

44
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:04,869
Looks like their home

45
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,060
should be the first scene
where Tai Shu was killed.

46
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:08,959
They renovated the house last year,

47
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:11,480
just in time to destroy all evidence.

48
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,160
Everything is reasonable,

49
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,560
but I'm more surprised

50
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,560
that an honest person like Na Wa

51
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:19,480
is actually meticulous.

52
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:22,480
Yes.

53
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,240
Too meticulous

54
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,360
and skillful.

55
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,040
Can someone really pretend for so long?

56
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,839
Why are you here?

57
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:50,680
I'm about to go back.

58
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,500
I just came over to let you know.

59
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:53,720
Su Pa's awake.

60
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,620
Find time to go and have a look.

61
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,640
I hope she and her mother

62
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,340
can live a stable life in the future.

63
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:06,900
Is there anything else?

64
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,079
What's with that photo?

65
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,040
Don't you know?

66
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,040
Bai Han gave it to me.

67
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:20,240
I have to find
the fourth person in the photo.

68
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,620
I may have had some misunderstandings
about you before.

69
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:32,120
But I now believe

70
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:33,240
you're a good person.

71
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,879
You just have a bad temper.

72
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:40,079
I don't need your affirmation.

73
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:42,000
Got it.

74
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:54,639
Let me know if you need anything.

75
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,080
I'll find a chance to repay you
for this favor.

76
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:28,279
Dr. Qi.

77
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:31,000
Why does such a beautiful face

78
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:32,839
look so worried?

79
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:37,160
Didn't I suspect

80
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,180
there was something wrong
with Tai Shu's wound?

81
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,680
I'm wondering if it's not a crossbow,

82
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:43,959
but some other sharp weapon.

83
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,600
It's unlikely.

84
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,560
The body was badly decomposed.

85
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,560
If only I could get

86
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,320
the crossbow arrowhead
that killed Jie En

87
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,920
to simulate and compare.

88
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,560
These flowers...

89
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,839
I was passing through a small hill

90
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,439
and saw someone selling them.

91
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,680
I think they look pretty good

92
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,800
and bought a bunch

93
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,199
to give them to my wife...

94
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,639
If you're in a bad mood,

95
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,920
I can give them to you first.

96
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,480
Are you saying

97
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,959
that someone is growing these flowers
on the hillside nearby?

98
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,639
Yes.

99
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,150
I was scared to death.

100
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,600
I thought they were opium poppies,

101
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,020
but they're just common poppies.

102
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,149
Both of these
belong to the poppy family.

103
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,850
It's indeed difficult
to distinguish them.

104
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,159
The common poppy

105
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,960
is also a flower of the poppy family,

106
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,519
but its beauty is untouched by sin.

107
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,720
However,

108
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,960
beauty itself is innocent.

109
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,670
Even if it is an opium poppy,

110
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,600
is it born to be wrong?

111
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,240
All sins

112
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,000
are inflicted by us humans.

113
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,279
I really hope

114
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:40,960
that all the opium poppies in Buhe City

115
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,519
can become common poppies.

116
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:45,039
That's a big project.

117
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,900
It seems a bit difficult for me
to destroy all the opium poppies

118
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,750
by myself.

119
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,180
But I have no problem
planting a few more common poppies

120
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:52,880
for you.

121
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:59,120
I'll give you

122
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,480
a common poppy garden.

123
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,080
Just right here.

124
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,820
This place will be
full of common poppies in the future.

125
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,639
Here?

126
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:20,720
Sir.

127
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:22,840
I would like to ask

128
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:24,960
if you planted these flowers?

129
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,720
Yeah.

130
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:32,720
Can you sell them?

131
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,720
I want to buy some.

132
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,919
Give me a moment.

133
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,790
Sorry to trouble you.

134
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,480
They're for you. Take them.

135
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,260
Free of charge.

136
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,240
Thank you.

137
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,159
Shu He.

138
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,680
Na Wa has been taken back
to Buhe City Police Station.

139
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:22,039
I'm about to go back too.

140
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,320
I'll have to trouble you.

141
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,360
We need your report.

142
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:25,879
Sure.

143
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,039
The evidence your brother found.

144
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,000
I'll send it back to the station
for comparison.

145
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,039
Take Ke Xin
back to the police station too.

146
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,740
There's no harm
in asking more questions.

147
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,720
Although her words
can't be used as testimony,

148
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,840
they can indirectly support
Na Wa's confession.

149
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,159
Okay.

150
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,399
Are they for me?

151
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:56,759
No.

152
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,320
I'll go back now.

153
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,000
Be safe.

154
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:14,679
Ka Lin.

155
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,399
Help me take care of her.

156
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:19,480
Don't be scared. Go.

157
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:16,440
Hello?

158
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:17,559
Hello, Dr. Qi?

159
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,559
Where are you?

160
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:20,919
We're on our way back to the city.

161
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,080
I compared it again.

162
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,980
Jie En was indeed
killed by a crossbow arrow,

163
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,120
but Tai Shu wasn't.

164
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:28,840
Not a crossbow?

165
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,039
Shall we go back and look for it?

166
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:34,399
What happened?

167
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:36,639
Hello?

168
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,639
Why are you here?

169
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:19,840
I'm here to see you.

170
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,919
How are you?

171
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:25,399
It's no big deal.

172
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:28,080
The doctor said I just hurt my shoulder.

173
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:32,879
Na Wa has been taken away by the police.

174
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:35,200
What are your plans next?

175
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,039
When my injury heals,

176
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:45,159
I'll take my mother away
from Yong'an Village

177
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:46,480
and start over

178
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:47,559
somewhere else.

179
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,720
What about you? When are you going back?

180
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,940
After you're discharged
from the hospital.

181
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,560
Or there will be no one
to take care of Madam Ke Xin at home.

182
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:08,399
I might also need to thank you.

183
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,440
If you hadn't returned
to Yong'an Village,

184
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:15,399
none of this would have happened.

185
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,600
How far was Na Wa from you

186
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,080
when he attacked you?

187
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,320
About

188
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:32,559
two or three meters.

189
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:33,720
Two or three meters?

190
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:42,960
How is that possible?

191
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,880
He only shot you in the shoulder

192
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,120
at such a close distance.

193
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,120
But Jie En was shot dead with one arrow.

194
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,600
Na Wa doesn't really want to kill you.

195
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,559
There's one thing I don't understand.

196
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:06,960
How did Madam Ke Xin go crazy?

197
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,039
Hello?

198
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,960
Na Wa escaped?

199
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,080
Okay, got it.

200
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,639
He...

201
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,920
He won't do anything to my mother,
will he?

202
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:28,320
Don't worry.

203
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,279
I won't let Madam Ke Xin get hurt.

204
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,840
I'll go check it out first.

205
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:49,320
Hello?

206
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,120
I'm on my way back.

207
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:18,960
Are you okay?

208
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,350
I'm okay. I just have some flesh wounds.

209
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,319
What can happen to me?

210
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,480
No need to look anymore.

211
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,519
Shu He has set up checkpoints
on all the roads

212
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:29,839
out of the city.

213
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,519
Na Wa can't escape. Don't worry.

214
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,400
He probably isn't trying to run away,

215
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:34,880
but to go back.

216
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,839
Go back?

217
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,510
Won't he be sending himself into a trap?

218
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:40,720
I just checked the area.

219
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,520
There are no sharp turns or blind spots

220
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:43,920
on this road.

221
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,460
There is even a surveillance camera
not far ahead.

222
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:48,240
He probably didn't plan it in advance,

223
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,759
but acted on impulse.

224
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,040
What were you doing
when he attacked you?

225
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,519
I didn't do anything.

226
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:00,079
I...

227
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,559
I was on the phone with Dr. Qi.

228
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:04,359
I told him

229
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,900
I found out that the weapon
that killed Tai Shu

230
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:07,860
wasn't a crossbow.

231
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,240
Crossbow?

232
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,800
Come on. Let's check out his house.

233
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:16,039
Wait here.

234
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:16,640
Be careful.

235
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,359
Go.

236
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,839
Here. Hurry.

237
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:41,160
Granny Yun.

238
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:41,960
Granny.

239
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:43,920
Granny, here.

240
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,039
Get up. Hurry.

241
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,759
Be careful.

242
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:48,599
Take it easy.

243
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,720
Here, sit.

244
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,400
Take it easy.

245
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,079
Granny.

246
00:18:57,559 --> 00:18:59,680
What happened? Who did this?

247
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,400
I raised two sons.

248
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,359
Both of them are bad.

249
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,680
Criminals.

250
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,839
The villagers came to my house,

251
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,519
smashing and throwing my things.

252
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,759
They wanted to drive me away.

253
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,920
What's the point of leaving?

254
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:20,480
I should just die.

255
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:21,839
God

256
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,359
is punishing me.

257
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:28,519
Granny, don't be too upset.

258
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,440
Tell us who bullied you.

259
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:31,920
We'll take you to the police later.

260
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:34,799
Siyuan.

261
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,559
Clean up this place.

262
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,220
Granny, you must be hungry.

263
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,380
I'll go to the kitchen
and get you something to eat.

264
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:44,440
Granny, sit here.

265
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:45,680
I'll clean up the place.

266
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:37,500
(Ke Xin: You once told me
that you have a curse.)

267
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:40,720
Xia.

268
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:42,200
Things might not be what we think.

269
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:47,240
Who made this?

270
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,440
Granny Yun can't cook by herself
because of her eyes.

271
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,440
Li Zhi and Su Pa
are both in the hospital.

272
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,440
Who could have made this?

273
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:55,599
Na Wa must have come back.

274
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,640
This was his final farewell
to his mother.

275
00:20:58,119 --> 00:20:58,799
But

276
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,559
he has one last thing to do.

277
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,400
Oh no.

278
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,039
If these love letters are real,

279
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:07,680
his confession yesterday is false.

280
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:08,759
I love her.

281
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,039
I've done so much for her.

282
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:11,559
How can it not be love?

283
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,760
His purpose is
to cover up the real reason

284
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,799
why Madam Ke Xin
went crazy five years ago.

285
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,519
What he has to do now

286
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,680
is to destroy the first crime scene

287
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,720
where Tai Shu died.

288
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,440
He wants to commit suicide.

289
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,160
Is the first scene at Ke Xin's home?

290
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:26,960
Yes.

291
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,960
Is the one who killed Tai Shu Ke Xin?

292
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:29,960
No.

293
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:30,920
It's Su Pa.

294
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,333
(May 17, 2014)

295
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,559
- Let go!
- Come on.

296
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:42,119
Let Mom go!

297
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:44,200
Let go!

298
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:46,480
Perfect timing.

299
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:49,319
The three of us can have fun together.

300
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:53,200
Let my mom go.

301
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,920
How dare you bite me?

302
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,000
Come here.

303
00:21:57,079 --> 00:21:58,920
Help.

304
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:01,119
Didn't you open this lousy shop

305
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,880
just to entertain customers?

306
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:07,039
Help!

307
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,400
Help.

308
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:35,799
Dead...

309
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:41,160
He's dead?

310
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,200
Dead.

311
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:46,720
I killed someone?

312
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,079
I killed someone?

313
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:56,200
Mom.

314
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,200
Mom.

315
00:22:58,839 --> 00:23:00,039
Mom, I killed someone.

316
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:00,599
Mom.

317
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,039
Mom!

318
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:09,720
Leave.

319
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:19,759
Leave this place.

320
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:22,319
Leave this place.

321
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:26,160
Leave.

322
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,599
Leave.

323
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,079
Leave.

324
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:57,599
I was so scared

325
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,519
that I kept running

326
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:03,720
till dawn.

327
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:07,079
I came to my senses.

328
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,799
I couldn't leave my mom at home.

329
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,680
I'm leaving with my mom.

330
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,839
But the body was gone

331
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,480
when I got home.

332
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,680
Tai Shu was taken away.

333
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:38,880
Taken...

334
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:40,160
Mom.

335
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,559
Where's Tai Shu?

336
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,720
River Spirit has taken Tai Shu away.

337
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:51,440
River Spirit has taken Tai Shu away.

338
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:03,039
River Spirit has taken Tai Shu away.

339
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:09,960
River Spirit...

340
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,079
River Spirit has taken Tai Shu away.

341
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:18,279
River Spirit has taken Tai Shu away.

342
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,720
Tai Shu was taken away.

343
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:22,200
River Spirit...

344
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,200
River Spirit...

345
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,440
Since then,

346
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,799
I always believed
that River Spirit helped us.

347
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,640
I didn't expect

348
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,559
that Na Wa

349
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:40,240
to do all this for my mom.

350
00:26:15,934 --> 00:26:18,620
(May 17, 2014)

351
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,310
What did you do with my camera?

352
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,510
Give me back my camera.

353
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:00,200
Get lost.

354
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:01,349
Get up.

355
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,240
Give me back my camera.

356
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:02,840
Get lost.

357
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,760
Look at how cowardly you are.

358
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:08,950
Be honest.

359
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:10,260
Do you want to sleep with her too?

360
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,000
You're sick!

361
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,799
Forget it.

362
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,000
I'll try it myself.

363
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:17,559
How dare you?

364
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:21,400
See if I dare.

365
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,240
I'll rip off her clothes

366
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:24,720
before taking off her pants.

367
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:43,720
Don't be scared.

368
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:46,920
It's alright now.

369
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:51,440
I'll take care of this.

370
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:32,640
It's the modern age,

371
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,760
and people are still throwing bodies
into the river?

372
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,290
Aren't you afraid
that you'll be discovered

373
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:38,310
tomorrow morning?

374
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:42,559
Although the police here
aren't efficient,

375
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,000
it only takes one day

376
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:47,279
to solve a case like yours.

377
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,680
What are you trying to do?

378
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,799
We can help you.

379
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,100
You can repay us with a favor.

380
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,079
Just help us with one thing.

381
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,680
Don't worry.

382
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:12,680
We're professional.

383
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,030
As long as I can get rid of him,

384
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,030
I'll do anything you ask me to do.

385
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,480
Remember.

386
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,680
If the truth is revealed one day,

387
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:39,640
Ke Xin is the murderer.

388
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,039
You have to do two things
starting today.

389
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:47,240
First, never get close to them.

390
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,200
Second, make yourself despicable.

391
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,480
Make everyone believe

392
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,039
that what you do

393
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,759
comes from your despicable heart.

394
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,660
Because people are more willing

395
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:02,160
to believe in desire than love.

396
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:07,680
River Spirit.

397
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,200
I know murder is a crime.

398
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,200
Murder is a crime.

399
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:19,319
I'm willing

400
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,200
to take on everything for Ke Xin.

401
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:27,359
Don't look for her.

402
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,160
Come at me.

403
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:34,480
Come at me.

404
00:31:58,519 --> 00:31:59,400
Don't be scared.

405
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:02,599
It's alright, Ke Xin.

406
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,720
Nothing happened today.

407
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,759
It's all just a dream.

408
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:12,440
Alright?

409
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:19,640
That guy...

410
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,200
He has been taken away by River Spirit.

411
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:33,480
River Spirit has taken Tai Shu away.

412
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,039
River Spirit?

413
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,599
River Spirit

414
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,839
has taken Tai Shu away.

415
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:52,119
River Spirit has taken Tai Shu away.

416
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:57,160
River Spirit has taken Tai Shu away.

417
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,599
River Spirit has taken Tai Shu away.

418
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:08,119
River Spirit has taken Tai Shu away.

419
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:24,160
Mr. Na Wa!

420
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,880
Mr. Na Wa!

421
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,519
I'll go check if there are other doors.

422
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,279
Mr. Na Wa.

423
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:42,759
Why are you here?

424
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:43,839
Mr. Na Wa.

425
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:46,359
I know why you came back here.

426
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:51,319
Don't make me, Siyuan.

427
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,799
Mr. Na Wa.

428
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,359
I know

429
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:56,599
why you told such a big lie.

430
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,400
You painted yourself

431
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,680
as a despicable person

432
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,960
just to protect Madam Ke Xin.

433
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,480
Right?

434
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,079
The hairpin on your chest

435
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,039
is the murder weapon.

436
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,760
And this is the first scene
where Tai Shu and Jie En were killed.

437
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:19,119
You're here to destroy the evidence.

438
00:34:20,039 --> 00:34:20,760
Right?

439
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,000
Siyuan.

440
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:32,199
You're just like your brother.

441
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:34,840
You're just

442
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:37,440
and kind.

443
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,719
Your parents in heaven must be happy

444
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,239
to see you like this.

445
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,000
Wait!

446
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,679
You know what?

447
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,599
This world is so unfair to Ke Xin.

448
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:02,639
I can only use my life

449
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:04,000
to fight this injustice.

450
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:12,760
Isn't this the justice you want to see?

451
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:18,440
Mr. Na Wa!

452
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:20,960
Mr. Na Wa!

453
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:23,519
Mr. Na Wa.

454
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,880
Do you know why Madam Ke Xin

455
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,559
wore a red wedding dress?

456
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,079
Do you know why the villagers called her

457
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,880
River Spirit's woman from that day on?

458
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,280
Doesn't our village have a tradition?

459
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:41,079
Whenever a girl decides who to marry,

460
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:48,079
she will put on a red wedding dress

461
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,440
to meet the man she loves.

462
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,199
That's her answer to you.

463
00:35:56,679 --> 00:35:58,159
She made her decision

464
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,020
the night Tai Shu violated her.

465
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:04,679
She wants to put on her wedding dress
and go with you.

466
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,079
You're the one she wants to marry.

467
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,440
Are you really willing to leave her?

468
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:28,150
When I was little,
I felt that fate was unfair

469
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:29,719
because of Tai Shu.

470
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,480
I understand it now.

471
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,400
Meeting Ke Xin

472
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:41,559
is what makes my fate fair.

473
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,760
I'm content

474
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,599
with this life.

475
00:36:56,559 --> 00:36:57,199
I'm content.

476
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,440
Siyuan, watch out!

477
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,400
Mr. Na Wa!

478
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:03,880
Mr. Na Wa!

479
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,360
Did Bai Han teach you
how to hide the body?

480
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,030
Is he also the one who taught you

481
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:09,280
the serial killing method?

482
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,280
Don't trust him!

483
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:11,639
He's a murderer.

484
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,070
You obviously have a better choice.

485
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:14,760
Why would you trust him and kill others?

486
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,920
Stop asking.

487
00:37:18,199 --> 00:37:19,519
Stop investigating.

488
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,639
Stop living in the past.

489
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,440
You should live a normal life.

490
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,719
Siyuan.

491
00:37:31,159 --> 00:37:31,960
Remember.

492
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,230
Living with peace of mind

493
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:39,159
is a blessing.

494
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,079
Na Wa.

495
00:37:57,519 --> 00:37:58,199
Ke Xin!

496
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,800
Ke Xin, hurry out.

497
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:00,920
You'll be fine.

498
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:21,960
Where's the hairpin you gave me?

499
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,880
Ke Xin, let's leave together.

500
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,840
Let's leave this place.

501
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:52,199
Will you?

502
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:32,119
