(Year 2011, Meet Bar)

2
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:36,760
(Meet Bar's Courtesan of the Year)

3
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:13,799
Handsome.

4
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:20,840
Handsome.

5
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:23,239
Are you alone?

6
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,439
What do you think?

7
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,280
It's not a bad idea to consider today

8
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:33,359
as your birthday, right?

9
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,040
Won't you congratulate me?

10
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:47,250
=The Embers=

11
00:03:48,634 --> 00:03:51,050
=Episode 8=

12
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:42,759
Hello, are you Xu Man?

13
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:46,079
I'm the chief
of Buhe City's police team,

14
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,000
Shu He.

15
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:48,519
I'm Ni Ke.

16
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,120
It's late.

17
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:54,959
What's the matter?

18
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,800
There have been
a series of serial murders

19
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,800
in Buhe City recently.

20
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,190
Have you heard about it?

21
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:02,639
What does it have to do with me?

22
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,519
The victims were all your acquaintances.

23
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,240
We suspect you're the murderer's

24
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:06,959
next target.

25
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:08,759
We're here to protect you.

26
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,120
Are you here to protect me

27
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,000
or to suspect me?

28
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,439
It's late.

29
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:55,639
Do you have a guest?

30
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,959
The water pipe burst.

31
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,360
My driver is fixing it.

32
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:07,319
I'm exhausted.

33
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,720
Please leave.

34
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,720
Sure.

35
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,140
We'll leave you alone for now.

36
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,199
I fixed it.

37
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,879
Ms. Xu Man.

38
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:16,680
I fixed it.

39
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:23,519
Please sit.

40
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:26,319
No thanks.

41
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,240
I have something to do,
so I'll go first.

42
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,680
You're my driver today after all.

43
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:32,840
You should

44
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,720
be responsible for my safety.

45
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,960
In the past,
you had to spend a lot of money

46
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,720
if you wanted me to drink.

47
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,480
Is that so?

48
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:49,240
Thank you for today.

49
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,000
Don't mention it.

50
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,360
I'm a little scared.

51
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,360
Will you keep me company?

52
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:35,639
I really have something
to do tomorrow morning.

53
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:36,519
I have to go.

54
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,919
Liao Siyuan.

55
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,080
What's your relationship with Nu Na?

56
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:26,440
She knew

57
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,519
the truth about the fire.

58
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,639
How much do you know about me?

59
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:36,440
Aren't you friends?

60
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,960
Did you kill Nu Na,

61
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,240
Lin, and Man Ni?

62
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,840
Why did you kill them?

63
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:53,120
What did you have to do
with my house's fire?

64
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,759
You're back.

65
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,279
Siyuan.

66
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,679
I was away for half a day,

67
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:33,240
and you're having fun

68
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,879
with that wealthy lady.

69
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,600
Where is she?

70
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,159
How would I know?

71
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:42,960
Put on your pants.

72
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,560
Nothing happened last night, right?

73
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:45,639
Put on your pants.

74
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,480
No.

75
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,320
I poured out the drink.

76
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:52,679
I switched the glass.

77
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:53,680
You didn't even think

78
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,800
about what she used to do.

79
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,550
How could a girl working in a nightclub

80
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:58,360
let you change the glass

81
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,200
right under her nose

82
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,120
without her knowing?

83
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,749
Otherwise, she would have been

84
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,190
completely devoured by her customers.

85
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:06,039
You mean she poisoned the bottle?

86
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,550
But I checked it.

87
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:09,360
It's just a small amount of amobarbital.

88
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,029
It was a truth serum

89
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,840
used for interrogations
during World War II,

90
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,639
but it's now banned.

91
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,559
With Xu Man's identity,

92
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:17,840
it's not difficult for her

93
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:19,000
to get something like this.

94
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:25,279
I remember she called my name

95
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,559
before I passed out last night.

96
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:28,080
She knows who I am.

97
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,559
And she has a banned drug.

98
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,240
Maybe she really
had something to do with the fire,

99
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,639
but it's strange.

100
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:35,360
She could have killed you,

101
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,750
but why did she just drug you

102
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:37,919
and let you sleep?

103
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,159
Why is that?

104
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:41,879
She likes you.

105
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:44,120
Don't talk nonsense.

106
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,000
I didn't do anything
with her last night.

107
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,320
Siyuan, it's fine.

108
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,080
I understand.

109
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,240
You're already an adult.

110
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,960
It's normal
even if something happened.

111
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,039
But remember.

112
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,720
Our family isn't promiscuous.

113
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,440
You must treat her well, alright?

114
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,879
You hear me?

115
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,559
Hey!

116
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,000
You smell quite good, Liao Siyuan.

117
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:32,360
I stood in for you all night.

118
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,399
Where were you?

119
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,200
Our classmate, Liao Siyuan,

120
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:41,360
sacrificed himself for the truth

121
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:44,200
and slept with Xu Man.

122
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:49,840
I...

123
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,519
Okay.

124
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:55,559
Okay.

125
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,759
Am I that kind of person?

126
00:14:57,759 --> 00:14:58,519
Yes, you are.

127
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,080
Tell us the details.

128
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:01,639
Alright.

129
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:04,240
Tell me what's going on.

130
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,799
Nothing's really going on.

131
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,120
At the iron gate
of the villa opposite yesterday,

132
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,120
I saw Xu Man
go out in the middle of the night.

133
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,279
I followed her

134
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,559
and found that she entered

135
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:18,000
a nearby 24-hour coffee shop.

136
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,870
She bought coffee
and filled out a survey

137
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,320
after entering.

138
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:23,639
She did nothing else.

139
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:26,600
It was late.

140
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:27,960
And she bought coffee...

141
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:33,080
What about you? Did you find anything?

142
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:36,559
I found

143
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:38,200
a large stash of cash,

144
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:39,679
a gun,

145
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,080
and a wedding dress in her closet.

146
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:48,440
A wedding dress?

147
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:52,600
Is she the murderer then?

148
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,480
From what we know so far,

149
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,799
she has the ability to kill

150
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,200
but has no motive.

151
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:01,919
This woman is scary.

152
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:04,440
How about we stop investigating?

153
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:05,360
Yeah.

154
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:07,919
It's too dangerous.

155
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,240
How about leaving the rest
to the police?

156
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,240
Let's leave it alone.

157
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:17,120
Meet Bar's owner told us

158
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,320
that the four of them

159
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,600
used to be very close.

160
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:21,200
So she has no motive for murder

161
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,480
on the surface.

162
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,030
But think about it carefully.

163
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,740
Just because they used to be close

164
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,560
doesn't mean they will always be close.

165
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,320
And Xu Man's life

166
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,039
has changed dramatically over the years.

167
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:32,159
She became wealthy

168
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:33,960
overnight.

169
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,799
If they used to be that close,

170
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:37,840
why didn't she

171
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,840
lend a helping hand

172
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,120
when Lin was in dire straits?

173
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:41,840
So something else

174
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,039
must have happened over the years.

175
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:45,720
Siyuan.

176
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:48,039
Did you find anything else?

177
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:05,680
Liao Siyuan.

178
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,799
Our chief told me

179
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,480
not to help you in private.

180
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,640
It was indeed a misunderstanding
last time.

181
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:13,799
But think about it.

182
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:15,720
If you solve this case,

183
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,920
your superior will be so happy

184
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,200
that he promotes you to chief.

185
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,980
Do you still need
to watch Shu He's mood?

186
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,640
You're

187
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,680
a sweet talker.

188
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,070
I'm telling you.

189
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,440
I'm doing this all for myself...

190
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,119
I meant the case.

191
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,480
I'm not doing this for myself.

192
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:32,480
It's for the case.

193
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,279
Don't you find it strange?

194
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:38,960
This thing is old.

195
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:41,079
Isn't she wealthy?

196
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,380
Why would she wear this?

197
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,319
It's indeed quite strange.

198
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,560
Whether it's a gift from someone else

199
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,660
or custom-made,

200
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:50,279
aren't pendants usually

201
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:52,039
patterns or words related to yourself?

202
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,119
Does the begonia flower

203
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:56,920
have a special meaning for her?

204
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,440
Can you help me check

205
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,800
if there are any of her friends

206
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,750
whose names contain the word "Tang"?

207
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,920
The word "Tang"
from the begonia flower.

208
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:07,960
Okay.

209
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:09,599
Hello, Sir.

210
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:10,559
Your coffee.

211
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,279
I'm sorry.

212
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:14,440
It's fine.

213
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:17,440
I'll get a towel to wipe it for you.

214
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,200
What are you doing?

215
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,519
How clumsy.

216
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,640
It was just an accident.

217
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:23,880
I'm so sorry.

218
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,200
You said she came to this cafe

219
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,759
in the middle of the night yesterday?

220
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,640
She came here, ordered a cup of coffee,

221
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:33,960
and filled up a survey.

222
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,319
She did nothing else

223
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,519
or said anything else.

224
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:39,160
What survey?

225
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,880
- This one.
- This one.

226
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,160
The restaurant has a new menu

227
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,200
and prepared some survey questionnaires.

228
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,620
I've seen it,
and there's nothing wrong with it.

229
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:48,440
Siyuan.

230
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,440
Do you notice

231
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,720
that these three victims

232
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,400
had one thing in common?

233
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,400
They lack money.

234
00:18:57,839 --> 00:18:59,440
Nu Na's Serendipity Bridal Shop

235
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,640
isn't doing well.

236
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,440
Man Ni is facing
huge liquidated damages.

237
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,920
Lin's life has been difficult

238
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,039
since she left the bar.

239
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:08,200
But Xu Man is rich.

240
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:09,599
Think about it.

241
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:11,359
If you were one of those

242
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,960
whose lives were difficult,

243
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:14,160
and you suddenly remembered

244
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,880
that your former friend

245
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,039
is now a rich woman

246
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,860
who happened to be in Buhe City,

247
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,070
what would you do?

248
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,200
Blackmail her?

249
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,200
Xu Man is rich and powerful now,

250
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,200
so she won't want anyone
to know her past.

251
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,720
Besides, blackmail
between friends like this

252
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,519
is simply endless.

253
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:33,079
So she was forced to kill

254
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,000
to silence them.

255
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,799
If she's really the murderer,

256
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,359
three people have died.

257
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,000
She achieved her goal.

258
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,759
The next thing she has to do

259
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:49,440
is to get away.

260
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,680
Hello? Ms. Xu Man.

261
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,460
Alright, I'll come over immediately.

262
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:12,680
Sure.

263
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,039
She called?

264
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:15,920
Yes.

265
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:19,200
She might be leaving.

266
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,980
Find a way to keep her
from leaving Buhe City for now.

267
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:22,640
Hurry.

268
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,559
How can I find a way?

269
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:26,079
I don't even have any evidence.

270
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:26,839
Siyuan.

271
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:29,680
Where are you going?

272
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,640
Thank you.

273
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:32,680
Why...

274
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,720
You didn't even leave me one.

275
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,839
I found it.

276
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,880
There's only one local

277
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,760
named Lan Xiaotang
who has the word "Tang"

278
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,200
in her name and is related to Xu Man.

279
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:02,279
She went to jail for manslaughter
a few years ago,

280
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,200
but the record stated

281
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,000
she was released this year.

282
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:10,720
I'm sorry

283
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,200
for thinking you're a bad person.

284
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,039
This meal is on me.

285
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,359
Consider it as an apology to you.

286
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,039
Boss.

287
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:19,119
Two spicy and sour chicken feet

288
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,720
and two seafood fried noodles.

289
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,310
How long are you staying in Buhe City?

290
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,660
I'm leaving tomorrow.

291
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,920
That's why I came here
for a scrumptious meal today.

292
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,840
I'm telling you.

293
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,550
I hate to leave this smell.

294
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:36,079
Since you're reluctant to leave,

295
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,400
why not stay two more days?

296
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,680
What's that supposed to mean?

297
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,100
Are you trying to make me stay?

298
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:46,400
Sure.

299
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:48,359
Stay at my place tonight.

300
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,880
You can also see me off
at the airport tomorrow.

301
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:05,599
Ms. Xu Man.

302
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,200
I think we should stop acting.

303
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:10,279
You probably know

304
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:12,519
that I'm not your driver.

305
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,759
I just didn't realize

306
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,720
you were with the police.

307
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:25,359
I'm interested in you.

308
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,799
You're like an old friend of mine.

309
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,880
You pretended to be a driver

310
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,400
to investigate me all for a promise.

311
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,680
That's why I asked you out for a chat.

312
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:37,240
I've been to your old workplace.

313
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,720
The owner said

314
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,799
you used to be close

315
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,079
with Nu Na,

316
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:45,599
but I didn't see your photo

317
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:47,519
in the bar's roster.

318
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,960
So you should be

319
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,520
on the first page of the roster, right?

320
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:01,680
That's what friendship between women

321
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,759
is like.

322
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:07,160
For example,

323
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:09,480
it's like plastic flowers.

324
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,880
They look beautiful from afar,

325
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:14,279
but you realize it's all fake

326
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,880
when you get closer.

327
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:19,039
Fake?

328
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,279
Think about it.

329
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,240
Who would be happy
working in a place like that?

330
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,359
But now that I think about it,

331
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,440
I already

332
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,759
got everything I want.

333
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:36,799
Happiness?

334
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,240
What's happiness?

335
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,160
Isn't life

336
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,279
just a cycle of jumping

337
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:52,240
from one fire pit to another?

338
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:55,079
Just get used to it.

339
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,160
The necklace around your neck
is quite special.

340
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,359
Do you like it?

341
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:20,599
It's ordinary.

342
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:21,680
What's special about it?

343
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,960
You're wealthy.

344
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,200
Why wear an ordinary necklace?

345
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,680
If I'm not mistaken,

346
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,079
it's a begonia flower.

347
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,079
Is it from Lan Xiaotang?

348
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,680
You investigated me very carefully.

349
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:54,680
You're right.

350
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:57,519
It was Lan Xiaotang.

351
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,510
(Lin's House)

352
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:10,440
(No. 13, Xinma Street)
Zhang.

353
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,160
(No. 13, Xinma Street)
Send this to forensics.

354
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:12,840
Sure.

355
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,920
I'm sorry.

356
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,920
Excuse me.

357
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,200
I'm sorry.

358
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,600
Get to work now that you're here.

359
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:18,920
Yes.

360
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,759
Don't be careless.

361
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:24,640
Xia, I'm really sorry.

362
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:26,000
I didn't mean to be late.

363
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,030
A small problem came up temporarily.

364
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:30,480
Looks like your new girlfriend

365
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,400
isn't easy to please.

366
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:32,119
Yes.

367
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:32,880
No.

368
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,590
That's not entirely true.

369
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,599
She's actually quite cute.

370
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,480
Do you smell anything?

371
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,900
Isn't it just the curry
that has gone bad?

372
00:25:54,839 --> 00:25:55,359
No.

373
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,200
It's a fragrant scent.

374
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,400
Don't you smell it?

375
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:03,920
I think I do.

376
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,599
It could be
the deceased's aromatherapy or perfume.

377
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:07,720
I'll go check it out.

378
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,680
My mother only found out

379
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,680
that my father's married
after she gave birth to me.

380
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:25,359
Later, my father
abandoned my mother and me.

381
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:28,880
My mother died not long after that.

382
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,920
I was too young.

383
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,680
I tried finding jobs everywhere.

384
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,880
No one wanted to hire me.

385
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,039
I begged on the streets.

386
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,640
Look at this street

387
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:43,920
and behind there.

388
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:46,440
I begged for food here

389
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:49,079
and raised myself.

390
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,119
Have a taste.

391
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,279
It's delicious.

392
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,120
I'll do it myself.

393
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,839
These are all Xiaotang's favorite foods.

394
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,960
We lived nearby back then.

395
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,759
When we were hungry,

396
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,759
we waited at the food stalls here

397
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:23,960
until people finished eating and left.

398
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,480
We secretly collected

399
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,839
the leftovers and ate them.

400
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,680
There were a few times when Xiaotang
almost fell asleep waiting,

401
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,760
but this group didn't leave

402
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,560
and kept drinking.

403
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,720
I was wondering

404
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,160
why they had so many things

405
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,279
to celebrate.

406
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,240
How come they were so happy?

407
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:42,960
I wondered

408
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,759
when I could grow up

409
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,519
and when I could

410
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:48,039
make a lot of money.

411
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:49,720
If I made money,

412
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,680
I would bring Xiaotang here to eat.

413
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,039
I'll order whatever I want.

414
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,119
I'll eat whatever I want.

415
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,880
I'll come whenever I want.

416
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,509
I don't have to wait

417
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:58,880
until the stall owner closes.

418
00:28:21,647 --> 00:28:27,130
(Xu Man, Lan Xiaotang)

419
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,440
Eat.

420
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:47,119
I just ate.

421
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,240
This is yours.

422
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,680
Will we have a good life in the future?

423
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,079
We will.

424
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:58,720
Can we eat chicken feet every day?

425
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,360
We'll eat chicken feet every day.

426
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,160
We must always stay together.

427
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,079
Chicken feet are most delicious

428
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:05,400
only when eaten with you.

429
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:08,359
Hurry.

430
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,780
Why didn't you ask her out for a meal

431
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:12,240
when you came back this time?

432
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:33,279
She's dead.

433
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:37,240
Nu Na and her gang killed her.

434
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,510
How did you know
it was Nu Na and her gang?

435
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,880
Did you see them do it?

436
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,840
It doesn't matter anymore.

437
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:16,319
I'm not who I used to be.

438
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,319
She's also not who she used to be.

439
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,559
Time froze at the most beautiful memory.

440
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,559
It's probably for the best.

441
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:56,799
Did you call me here today

442
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,079
just to tell me

443
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:01,319
this story?

444
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:06,960
What's the matter?

445
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:11,720
We both spent a night together.

446
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,640
Why do I have to pay to chat with you?

447
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:36,920
Liao Siyuan.

448
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,400
After Xiaotang died,

449
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:48,440
I never told anyone

450
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,799
what was on my mind.

451
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,079
Thank you.

452
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,039
And the fire you asked me about...

453
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:14,680
I don't understand what it means.

454
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,640
Even the police didn't know

455
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,220
Lan Xiaotang's whereabouts
after she was released from prison.

456
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:31,359
How did she know she was dead?

457
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,279
Besides,

458
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,110
she spoke of these past events

459
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,240
so sincerely.

460
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:40,039
It's clearly her motive for murder.

461
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,160
What is she after?

462
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,000
Where's

463
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:47,960
Lan Xiaotang?

464
00:32:55,057 --> 00:32:57,500
(Qi's Pharmacy, Healing hands
as warm as the spring breeze.)

465
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:58,720
You just let her go?

466
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,279
With no solid evidence,

467
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:01,559
I have no choice.

468
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,680
Keep your voice down.

469
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,960
They're all asleep.

470
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,599
You're doomed.

471
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,839
Is Ms. Meihua asleep?

472
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:34,840
You remember you have a home?

473
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:38,319
All of you

474
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:39,720
are never home.

475
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:46,980
The hospital notified me to pick you up
after you were discharged.

476
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,900
But when I arrived,

477
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,040
they told me
that you had already been discharged.

478
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,490
I couldn't get through to you either.

479
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,100
Were you itching for trouble again?

480
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,440
No.

481
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,599
Well...

482
00:33:56,359 --> 00:33:58,839
Li Zhi and Ma Luo said they wanted
to get rid of my bad luck.

483
00:33:59,319 --> 00:34:01,440
We had a meal together.

484
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,079
What's wrong?

485
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,079
Were you at Lin's house?

486
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:10,679
No.

487
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,440
You clearly smell like Lin's house.

488
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:18,920
What smell?

489
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,480
When I went to Lin's house earlier,

490
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:27,000
I smelled a special fragrance.

491
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:29,700
But I couldn't find
the source of the fragrance.

492
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:31,440
I went to the mall

493
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,639
and found this.

494
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,119
Smell it.

495
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,159
Orlando's Wish.

496
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,199
They smell the same.

497
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:45,840
What wish?

498
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:47,280
Orlando's Wish.

499
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,280
It's a perfume name.

500
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:51,480
I heard it was based on a novel.

501
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,599
And the price of the perfume

502
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:55,159
is not something Lin could afford.

503
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:03,880
Xia.

504
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,199
I found evidence.

505
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,719
The missed call on Lin's landline

506
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,760
is from Xu Man's villa.

507
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:16,719
The time was before Lin was killed.

508
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,000
Find the property management

509
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,360
and ask for surveillance footage.

510
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,639
Hurry.

511
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,159
Shu He.

512
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:24,440
Why are you here?

513
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:25,440
Didn't you go home?

514
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:27,519
Xu Man went to her house

515
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:28,920
on the day Lin's body was found.

516
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,119
I have evidence.

517
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,880
I had my colleague check her schedule.

518
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,340
She bought the earliest flight,

519
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,180
probably to escape.
