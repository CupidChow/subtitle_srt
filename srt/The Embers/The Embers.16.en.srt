1
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,039
Let me ask you,

2
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,199
those AH7s I told you
to sell off quietly,

3
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,070
how did they end up
in Bai Han's hands?

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,039
I swear,

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,879
I didn't know it was him.

6
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:27,039
He offered the highest price

7
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,620
and didn't even ask to check the goods.

8
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:29,500
He just told me

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,600
to drop them in a dumpster
at the abandoned building.

10
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,880
He seemed like he knew his stuff,

11
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:34,000
so I sold it to him.

12
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,700
I used the burner phone in the drawer
to contact him.

13
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,600
Don't worry.
It can't be traced back to us.

14
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,880
The higher-ups want me

15
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,079
to track down the leak now.

16
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,540
What do you want me to do?
Investigate myself?

17
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,150
No, no.

18
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,920
Or should I just hand you over to them?

19
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:48,600
No, no.

20
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:49,399
Please don't.

21
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,359
Hello.

22
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,760
Tie Xin.

23
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,680
I have one day left
before our deadline.

24
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,319
How did the AH7s go missing?

25
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:27,040
What have you found?

26
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,079
I'm close.

27
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,239
I've narrowed it down to three people.

28
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,400
Tie Xin?

29
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:41,120
If you don't bring me

30
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,480
the thief in 24 hours,

31
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:45,000
then as far as I'm concerned,

32
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,719
you're the thief.

33
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:48,000
Got it.

34
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,280
Loud and clear.

35
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:14,759
Yes?

36
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,800
I know

37
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,039
you took our AH7.

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,360
The higher-ups want answers,

39
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,560
and I need to give them an answer.

40
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:30,800
Let's meet.

41
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:34,639
Sure.

42
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,039
Where?

43
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,740
I'll text you the address.

44
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:16,680
We

45
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,120
finally meet.

46
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:22,439
You really came alone?

47
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,000
I came with nothing but good intentions.

48
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,780
What good intentions
are we talking about?

49
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,039
Thought I'd catch you
a little something,

50
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:35,560
but turns out, there's nothing left

51
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,319
in Yong'an Village's river.

52
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:47,199
There's something in that river,

53
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:48,639
the River Spirit.

54
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,599
He only takes bad people.

55
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:53,680
You sure you're not on his list?

56
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,960
Plenty of gods want me gone.

57
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,150
He'll have to get in line.

58
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,800
Let me take my shot then.

59
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,439
Wait, wait, hold on!

60
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:08,919
I really want to work with you.

61
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,919
Just give me a chance.

62
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:21,720
Keep talking.

63
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:24,800
Tie Xin is your enemy, right?

64
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,200
Well, he's been squeezing
the life out of me too.

65
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,279
To him, I'm nothing but a dog.

66
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:32,360
But if you take him out,

67
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:34,000
I get to move up.

68
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,800
Let's help each other.

69
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:38,360
What do you want?

70
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,079
I won't ask for much.

71
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:55,560
Just your dried fruit gift boxes.

72
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,510
A truckload of it.

73
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:05,639
Done.

74
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:11,319
We do this face-to-face.

75
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:15,279
Okay.

76
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:17,600
Wait for my call.

77
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:24,800
Tie Xin isn't an easy target.

78
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,270
I only get one shot at this.

79
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:28,120
And so do you.

80
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,639
To make sure nothing goes wrong...

81
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,540
Have you got enough people for the job?

82
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:37,720
Don't worry about that.

83
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,319
I don't.

87
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:16,279
Liao Siyuan,

88
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:18,839
can I ask you for a favor?

89
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:22,920
What is it?

90
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:26,680
When the case is closed,

91
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,959
light a river lantern

92
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,759
for my mom

93
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,960
and make a wish for her.

94
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,320
I wish

95
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,540
that she wouldn't
have to suffer anymore.

96
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,720
Got it.

97
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,120
I should've protected her.

98
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,879
You've done everything you could.

99
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,679
What happened to Tai Shu

100
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,399
wasn't your fault.

101
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,519
You were just a kid back then.

102
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:09,559
Stop blaming yourself.

103
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,399
Su Pa, you'll be fine.

104
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:23,759
What you did was self-defense.

105
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,120
After you go in,

106
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,360
I'll get you the best lawyer.

107
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,120
You'll be out in no time.

108
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:34,360
Thank you.

109
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,080
I wish we could go back in time.

110
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,240
Back to when we were kids,

111
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,639
chasing after your brother,
and playing without a care.

112
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,120
We've grown up now.

113
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,750
We have to learn to face things on our own.

114
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,639
You can do it.

115
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:18,639
I believe in you.

116
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,519
You and your brother are both amazing.

117
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,559
It's just a shame.

118
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,159
If only you had come back sooner.

119
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,240
Liao Siyuan,

120
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,759
she's our age.

121
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:49,399
I feel so bad for her.

122
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,279
Five sixes!

123
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,799
Fill her glass.

124
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,080
My son is calling.

125
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:38,690
(Siyuan)

126
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,639
What is it, Siyuan?

127
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,519
You remember me now, huh?

128
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,060
I'm coming home in a couple of days.

129
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:49,840
Well...

130
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,879
Ms. Meihua, I need a favor.

131
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,720
Do you know any good nursing homes?

132
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,000
A nursing home?

133
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,180
What, you think I'm old now?

134
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:02,840
Trying to send me away?

135
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:04,960
Not you.

136
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:07,559
It's Granny Yun from Yong'an Village.

137
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:08,879
Do you remember her?

138
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,399
Hold on.

139
00:12:18,546 --> 00:12:20,450
(Siyuan)

140
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,399
Granny Yun?

141
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,039
Of course, I remember her.

142
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,360
The old lady who lost her sight, right?

143
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,879
Both of her sons are gone.

144
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:37,240
She's elderly,

145
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,360
and blind.

146
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,519
I want to find
a good nursing home for her.

147
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,440
What happened to them?

148
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:45,639
It's a long story.

149
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,040
I'll explain when I see you.

150
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:50,399
Okay.

151
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:52,559
Siyuan,

152
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:53,679
I'll ask around

153
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:55,240
and see what I can find.

154
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,100
You stay out of trouble over there.

155
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,040
Come home soon.

156
00:12:59,039 --> 00:12:59,879
Wait for my update.

157
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,039
AH7 wasn't the cause of Jie En's death?

158
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,919
But I checked his medical records.

159
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,840
He didn't have
any underlying conditions.

160
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:20,919
Okay, talk later.

161
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,080
Siyuan, wait for me here.

162
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,960
Let's go back to Buhe later
once I'm done here.

163
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:33,759
Na Wa killed Jie En

164
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,320
because Jie En tried to rape Ke Xin.

165
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,159
Na Wa showed up just in time

166
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:39,840
and shot him with a crossbow.

167
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,440
When Jie En died,

168
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,879
he had that signature
death grin on his face.

169
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,960
But since the AH7 levels in his system

170
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,280
weren't enough to be fatal,

171
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:50,879
there's only one explanation,

172
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,080
he took the AH7

173
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,320
after drinking.

174
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,840
Then, an arrow tore through his throat.

175
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,670
He lost consciousness instantly,

176
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,590
and his expression frozen
in that eerie smile.

177
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:05,759
But something doesn't add up.

178
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,559
Jie En was drinking
and using drugs that night,

179
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,480
then he went after Ke Xin

180
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:13,879
and got shot by Na Wa.

181
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,000
None of that

182
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,440
was planned by Na Wa.

183
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:19,639
Yet, just hours after it all went down,

184
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:21,879
Na Wa was able to come up with the idea

185
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,759
of faking the "River Spirit killing"

186
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,420
and stage an elaborate crime scene.

187
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,960
That doesn't seem possible.

188
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:28,799
It wasn't just him.

189
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,120
Someone helped him.

190
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,879
And we've seen

191
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,679
this kind of setup before.

192
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,399
From the Lai La case to the Nu Na case,

193
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:39,680
he has created various bizarre
death scenes time and time again

194
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,870
at the hands of other people,

195
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:43,240
exploiting people's fear of the unknown

196
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,000
to manufacture the illusion

197
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,080
of the River Spirit.

198
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,420
There's only one person
who could pull it off.

199
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,639
Bai Han.

200
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:54,399
Yes, he must've been there.

201
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,039
And he arrived right before
Water Lantern Festival.

202
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,020
Since the Buhe police permitted
you to be involved in the case,

203
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:04,820
go ahead and watch.

204
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,960
Let me know when you're done.

205
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,279
Okay, thank you.

206
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:10,559
Thanks!

207
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:15,279
This is the only road into the village.

208
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:21,039
It's Bai Han.

209
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,679
Wait.

210
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:37,919
Who is this?

211
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,840
Liu Haixun.

212
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:52,600
A businessman from Buhe.

213
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,360
He's also the actual owner

214
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,620
of Jie En's dried fruit factory.

215
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:01,279
So he's the real boss behind the scenes.

216
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,559
Bai Han meeting with him here

217
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,720
wouldn't be buying dried fruit,
would he?

218
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:13,240
Siyuan,

219
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:15,080
get Xia to test the wastewater

220
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,480
from the dried fruit factory.

221
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,919
Wastewater?

222
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,559
Remember we talked about

223
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:23,679
how the river smelled different?

224
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:27,360
Yong'an Village isn't how I remember it.

225
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:28,799
Everything's different.

226
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,559
Even the smell of the river.

227
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,500
There's this weird stench.

228
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,000
The wastewater contains
high levels of methamphetamine.

229
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,800
That confirms it,

230
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,600
it's residue from AH7 production.

231
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:44,080
This is serious.

232
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,200
I need to call
the station and report it.

233
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,600
So they really were
using the factory as a front.

234
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,639
They were secretly manufacturing drugs

235
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,300
and using the dried fruit supply
chain to transport

236
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:03,200
and distribute them.

237
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,960
Liu Haixun and Bai Han

238
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,519
must have met to discuss AH7.

239
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,079
Based on what we've seen before,

240
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,079
there's only one reason Bai Han
would be dealing with AH7,

241
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:18,720
to kill someone.

242
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,359
Which means the fourth person
in that photo

243
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,070
is about to come into play.

244
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,240
We have to find Bai Han fast

245
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,220
and let him to tell us
that person's identity.

246
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:29,940
It's simple.

247
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:31,359
We follow the shipment.

248
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,880
That'll take us straight to him.

249
00:17:36,697 --> 00:17:40,930
(Dried Fruit Factory)

250
00:17:57,839 --> 00:17:58,519
Great work.

251
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:00,839
Be meticulous.

252
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:22,720
Xun,

253
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,119
go home and rest.

254
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:25,360
I've got my eye on things here.

255
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,920
I need two reliable guys

256
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:30,200
to deliver this shipment tonight.

257
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,200
Got it, I'll find the guys.

258
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:35,119
No need for that trouble.

259
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:37,920
Those two seem pretty reliable.

260
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,200
I'm not going.

261
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,519
Why?

262
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:42,559
They just joined us last month.

263
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,440
They look pretty clueless.

264
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,720
Perfect for this job.

265
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,519
Get the compensation money ready.

266
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:51,759
Got it.

267
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,599
Come.

268
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,720
One, two, up!

269
00:18:58,279 --> 00:18:58,920
Bottom line,

270
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,260
we must catch both parties

271
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:01,880
in this drug deal.

272
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,079
Shu He,

273
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:04,960
you're in charge of this operation.

274
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,279
If you need a backup, call me anytime.

275
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,000
Yes, sir!

276
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,180
Let's get to work!

277
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:11,920
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

278
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,920
Buhe police have issued
an emergency support deployment.

279
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,960
They're heading out now
and will arrive by midnight.

280
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,750
It's too dangerous.

281
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:25,000
Do not act on your own.

282
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,830
Leave it to the police.

283
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:40,960
I did a quick search on Liu Haixun.

284
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:43,279
He became

285
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:45,160
a big boss overnight.

286
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,759
I think someone else is backing him.

287
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,279
What was he doing
before he struck it rich?

288
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,620
A security guard at a karaoke bar.

289
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,519
That's down-to-earth.

290
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,030
He doesn't even try to hide his past,

291
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,060
and it's all out there.

292
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,119
He actually likes

293
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,920
flaunting that he came from nothing.

294
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,160
That's odd.

295
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,799
If Liu Haixun built
his empire on drug trafficking,

296
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,640
and his operation is this secretive,

297
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:11,960
why would

298
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:13,680
he get involved with a lunatic

299
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,599
like Bai Han?

300
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,200
That's basically asking for trouble.

301
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:19,039
After all,

302
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:21,519
Bai Han is a reckless criminal.

303
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:24,359
If he wants drugs from Liu Haixun,

304
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,240
he doesn't really
have a choice, does he?

305
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,960
They're here.

306
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:37,500
Just as expected, they're trying to move
the goods under cover of darkness.

307
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,520
I wonder if Shu He
and his team have arrived yet.

308
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,550
We have to be careful.

309
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,359
Let's tail them first.

310
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,070
See if it will lead us to Bai Han.

311
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,039
Don't worry.

312
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:13,759
We won't lose this shipment.

313
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,759
Tell our guys

314
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:24,980
the shipment is arriving.

315
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,160
When Bai Han's men show up,

316
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,319
kill them all.

317
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,599
Got it, Tie Xin.

318
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,720
Everything's set.

319
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,400
Qi Xia,

320
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,240
have you gotten in touch with Siyuan?

321
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:06,759
No, I can't reach him.

322
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,110
My car keys are missing too.

323
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,200
Siyuan

324
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:11,039
definitely ran off on his own again.

325
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:12,519
We have to go after him.

326
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:13,400
He might be in danger.

327
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,440
Let's go.

328
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,880
A refrigerated truck
is coming behind us.

329
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,160
Let it pass first.

330
00:22:45,663 --> 00:22:48,380
(Bucha Highway)

331
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,119
Watch out, Siyuan!

332
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:02,640
What's that reefer doing?

333
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,359
Oh, no. I'm stuck.

334
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:24,400
What's going on?

335
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:46,960
Tie Xin,

336
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,720
Liu Haixun's car got flipped over.

337
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,119
An eagle doesn't perch on weak branches.

338
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:52,960
Bai Han set him up.

339
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,079
Forget about him.

340
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,110
Let's get out of here.

341
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,480
Siyuan, it's too dangerous.

342
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,400
Don't go any further.

343
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,920
Siyuan, don't be reckless!

344
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:51,440
Zhibai,

345
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,720
he's the last one in the photo.

346
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,830
Song En has lost mind,

347
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,310
Nu Na and Tai Shu are both dead.

348
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,319
We have to catch him!

349
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:07,400
Tie Xin,

350
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,759
a car is tailing us.

351
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:13,799
Get rid of it.

352
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:39,880
AH7.

353
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,350
Secure the site immediately.

354
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,550
- Secure the area.
- Yes, sir!

355
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,520
Secure the site now!

356
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,039
Siyuan, stop the car!
It's too dangerous!

357
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:18,000
Stop the car!

358
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:26,400
Xia!

359
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:29,720
Don't move.

360
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,359
How's my sister?

361
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:01,519
She's lightly injured,

362
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,720
but she'll need some time to recover.

363
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,559
Now tell me, what happened?

364
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:14,640
What do you mean?

365
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,830
What crime did I commit this time?

366
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:18,759
You tell me.

367
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,519
I saw him,

368
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,319
the fourth person in the photo.

369
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,680
I tried to catch up
to get a better look,

370
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:39,759
but I can't remember.

371
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:51,680
Take a look at this.

372
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:53,880
Maybe it'll jog your memory.

373
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,599
How did this happen?

374
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,359
Zhibai,

375
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:28,559
how could this happen?

376
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,039
What do you mean?

377
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,119
Why?

378
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:32,400
Why what?

379
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,359
You knew Xia would get hurt

380
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,599
if you did that.

381
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,520
Why did you still go through with it?

382
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:44,640
That's what you're asking?

383
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:47,440
Don't worry, I had it under control.

384
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,790
I calculated everything,
the speed of the car, the wind,

385
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,180
and the trajectory of the bullets.

386
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,860
There wouldn't be any major casualties.

387
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,440
Besides, Xia has been trained...

388
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,240
But she got hurt!

389
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,799
It's just a minor injury.

390
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:01,000
She'll be fine by tomorrow.

391
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,799
How can you say that so casually?

392
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,200
Do you seriously not care at all?

393
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,039
Care about what?

394
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,839
You're the last person
who should be asking that.

395
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,319
You should be worried about yourself.

396
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:29,200
Think about it.

397
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,720
Have you truly forgotten everything?

398
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,480
I kept telling you not to be reckless,

399
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:33,440
not to go after him.

400
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,100
But who was the one
who wouldn't listen?

401
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:36,839
What was I supposed to do?

402
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:38,640
Xia got hurt because of you.

403
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,860
If it weren't for me,

404
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,190
the one being carried
into the ambulance would've been you!

405
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:43,279
So what if it was me?

406
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:45,839
Even if I died,

407
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,880
I wouldn't do things the way you do!

408
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:52,880
You're nothing but a selfish jerk!

409
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:56,240
All you ever think about is yourself!

410
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,480
Liao Siyuan, listen,

411
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,720
you wouldn't even be alive today
if it weren't for me.

412
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,079
How is he, Dr. Bian?

413
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,079
Just as we suspected.

414
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,900
This is the latest research paper

415
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,020
I found on Dissociative
Identity Disorder (DID).

416
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,750
It provides a detailed explanation
of its characteristics.

417
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:13,359
At least two distinct personality states

418
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,640
and recurrent episodes
of dissociative amnesia.

419
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,880
Each identity

420
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,759
has its own memories, preferences,

421
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:23,119
and behavioral patterns.

422
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:25,319
The reason Liao Siyuan

423
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:27,000
appears to have lost part of his memory

424
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:28,960
is that his second personality

425
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,319
temporarily took control of his body.

426
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,000
Even though I've prepared myself for it,

427
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,830
seeing it with my own eyes
still feels unbelievable.

428
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:42,480
It really is.

429
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:46,319
When I was

430
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:47,559
researching DID,

431
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,519
I came across studies that mentioned

432
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:52,319
how personality switches

433
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,759
are usually triggered
by specific mechanisms.

434
00:32:56,079 --> 00:32:57,920
Based on our observations of Liao Siyuan,

435
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,119
his trigger seems to be

436
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:02,440
his second personality's instinct
to protect the first one unconditionally.

437
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:05,960
Am I right?

438
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,519
Yes.

439
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,720
At the core, it's just
a survival instinct.

440
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:15,839
It doesn't indicate
any emotional preference.

441
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:17,960
I understand.

442
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,820
It's not something he can control.

443
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,680
Whether it's his first personality

444
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,720
or his second,

445
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,680
I won't blame him.

446
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,740
There's one more thing
we need to be aware of.

447
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:32,039
This paper also mentions

448
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,140
that one of the most common
symptoms associated with DID

449
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:38,000
is suicidal ideation,
suicidal tendencies,

450
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:39,440
and self-destructive behavior.

451
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,640
Clinical data shows

452
00:33:41,799 --> 00:33:43,759
that about 62% to 71% of individuals

453
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:45,920
with DID have attempted suicide.

454
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:48,720
So, for now, we should

455
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,480
at least be relieved

456
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,920
that he's still
in a self-preservation phase.

457
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,160
But if this continues unchecked,

458
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,750
and if we don't get his
condition under control,

459
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,880
it won't just be about
him hurting others.

460
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:01,559
He could turn on himself.

461
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,900
And that would be extremely dangerous.

462
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,680
I'd rather be the one who got hurt.

463
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,280
No, forget getting hurt,

464
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,920
even if it meant dying,

465
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,320
I would still protect Xia!

466
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,840
What do I have to do to bring him home?

467
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:29,440
This incident caught a lot of attention.

468
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,880
First, we need to establish

469
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,000
that he truly wasn't able to recognize

470
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,280
or control his actions

471
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,880
when this happened.

472
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,480
Second, he has to show

473
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,960
a strong willingness
to cooperate with treatment.

474
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,400
That's the only way we might
secure a lighter sentence.

475
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,240
Otherwise,

476
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,000
bringing him home won't be easy.

477
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,639
But cooperating with treatment

478
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:55,820
means he has to acknowledge his condition,

479
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,159
he has to accept

480
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,800
that Liao Zhibai is dead.

481
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:01,719
Given the current situation,

482
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,070
do you think he would accept it?

483
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:17,039
Let me give it a try.

484
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:23,840
I'm too naive?

485
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:26,239
No, you're just too cold-hearted.

486
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,800
Let me tell you this,

487
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:29,679
if Xia finds out it was you...

488
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:39,559
Who are you talking to?

489
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:47,420
Finished watching the video?

490
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,679
Yes.

491
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,519
Well?

492
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:53,519
Do you have anything to explain?

493
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,039
No.

494
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,400
I don't remember it.

495
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,519
Must've hit my head.

496
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:08,079
Hit your head?

497
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,199
Was it really that,

498
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:14,760
or was that not even you?

499
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,440
If it wasn't me, who else could it be?

500
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,480
Okay.

501
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,840
As long as you're confirming it was you,

502
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,020
you'll be facing charges
for endangering public safety,

503
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:34,230
intentional harm,
and multiple other offenses.

504
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:36,079
No objections, right?

505
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:40,840
No objections.

506
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,960
I'm going to ask you one more time,

507
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:50,880
are you sure that was you?

508
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:51,960
Yes.

509
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,079
What about this?

510
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,360
Was this you too?

511
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:10,960
(Deduction, Criminal Profiling,
Criminal Investigation Techniques)

512
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:17,159
I looked into the books you borrowed.

513
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,360
The Science of Deduction,

514
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:21,840
Criminal Profiling,
Criminal Investigation Techniques.

515
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,559
You got to this level just from reading?

516
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,760
I have to admit,

517
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,400
you are natural.

518
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,320
What's so funny?

519
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,000
Let me guess, you still think

520
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,280
all of this was taught to you

521
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,800
by your invisible big brother,
Liao Zhibai?

522
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,360
Look at it again.

523
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:46,840
You learned it all on your own.

524
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,940
Honestly, whether you're sick or not

525
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,140
has nothing to do with me.

526
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,280
I couldn't care less.

527
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:06,360
But if you keep letting him exist,

528
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,559
and hurt people,

529
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,400
I won't stand by and watch.

530
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,519
What else can I do?

531
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:26,100
You and my brother were
classmates for four years.

532
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:29,280
Do you remember what he looked like?

533
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,559
Look,

534
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,079
he's standing right behind you.

535
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,079
Right there.

536
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:44,760
Just like you,

537
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,519
he's a living, breathing person.

538
00:38:56,199 --> 00:38:57,800
Why'd you go quiet all of a sudden?

539
00:38:59,559 --> 00:39:00,880
You had plenty to say just now.

540
00:39:02,559 --> 00:39:03,559
Look at his face.

541
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:05,559
He's sad.

542
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,920
He looks lost.

543
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,039
Like he's waiting for us,
the ones still alive,

544
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,239
to give him an answer,

545
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,079
to pass judgment on him.

546
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:20,880
Zhibai,

547
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
what are you doing?

548
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,519
You know, before you came in,

549
00:39:28,519 --> 00:39:29,559
I was arguing with him.

550
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,480
I was furious about what he did,

551
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:33,800
so darn pissed.

552
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,360
But now, when I look at him,

553
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,719
all I want to do is walk over,
pat him on the shoulder,

554
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:43,480
and tell him, Zhibai,

555
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:45,679
it's okay.

556
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:49,320
It's okay.

557
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:02,880
Calm down.

558
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:06,000
The doctor told us,

559
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:08,440
there's no exact cure

560
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,559
for your condition.

561
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,079
Only psychological therapy works.

562
00:40:16,679 --> 00:40:18,840
That's why your willingness
to cooperate is crucial.

563
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:21,840
Can you just listen?

564
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,800
If you work with us,

565
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,400
we'll do everything we can to help you.

566
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,120
How exactly am I supposed to cooperate?

567
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,679
Kill him?

568
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:34,400
Kill him in my own mind?

569
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,719
Make him die all over again?

570
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:39,079
Liao Zhibai is dead.

571
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,039
He died ten years ago.

572
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:44,199
There's no dying again.

573
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:44,920
Shut up.

574
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,840
Everything about him

575
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,920
exists only in your head.

576
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,960
You don't seriously believe
you can see ghosts, do you?

577
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:57,400
Do you even believe it
yourself if you say it out loud?

578
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,800
I don't care if he's
a person or a ghost.

579
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:04,679
It doesn't matter to me.

580
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,079
All I know is

581
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,079
that when I was at my lowest,

582
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:15,239
he was there.

583
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:17,079
He stayed with me,

584
00:41:18,039 --> 00:41:18,880
and encouraged me.

585
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,800
Without him, I might
not have survived at all.

586
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:29,119
I just want him to stay.

587
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,440
Is that so wrong?

588
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,840
This is the only way I can see him.

589
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,599
Why does everyone

590
00:41:38,599 --> 00:41:39,800
insist that I'm sick?
