(2008, Yong'an Village)

2
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,559
Here.

3
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,240
What's this?

4
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,280
A coupon.

5
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:36,840
What's it for?

6
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,960
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,880
I've been so busy

8
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,200
with the start-of-school stuff
and neglected you.

9
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,640
Don't be mad at me.

10
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,280
You were so busy that you even
forgot your boyfriend's birthday gift.

11
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:53,479
This is the gift.

12
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,320
This coupon

13
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,799
can make your wishes come true.

14
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,399
No matter what wish you have,

15
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:00,469
as long as I can do it,

16
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:01,760
I will make it happen for you.

17
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,159
You promise?

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,680
I promise.

19
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,359
Then...

20
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:11,519
I want

21
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:13,680
you

22
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:15,480
to marry me.

23
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:17,040
Except that.

24
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,480
Why not?

25
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,480
Hey, there's a kid here!

26
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,640
Dial down the flirting, okay?

27
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:22,719
You...

28
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:23,400
Shut up.

29
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,450
Keep it well. I'm leaving.

30
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,599
Wait, so...

31
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:27,200
Are we getting married or not?

32
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,520
- It's a proposal...
- Are we still playing?

33
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:37,879
Hang on.

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,480
You've already lost all your novels.

35
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,240
What are you going to play with now?

36
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,079
This.

37
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,430
What are you doing?

38
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:53,400
Can I use this

39
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,519
to get books from Qi Xia too?

40
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:57,879
Dream on! This is mine.

41
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,100
If I win, it's mine.

42
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,640
Even if you win, I won't give it to you.

43
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,519
Xia gave me that.

44
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:07,519
Better keep an eye on it, then.

45
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,800

49
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,350
That day, we went to the vegetable field

50
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:59,600
to take pictures of the carrots.

51
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,520
What? This is nonsense!

52
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,800
What kind of pictures are these!

53
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:03,910
It must be...

54
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,919
Were you there too?

55
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:06,039
It definitely wasn't me.

56
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,439
I'm great with cameras...

57
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:16,920
Chief.

58
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,680
Did you pull the plug on Song En's case?

59
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,399
Chief, are you joking with me?

60
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,760
Would I still be wearing this

61
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:23,950
if I had that kind of power?

62
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:28,680
Deputy Director Lei Nuo ordered
the case to be closed.

63
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,079
I'm just passing the message.

64
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,000
They deceive and lure young girls,

65
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,200
sell their eggs,
and force them into surrogacy.

66
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,360
This is a highly organized crime chain.

67
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,360
Song En couldn't have acted on his own.

68
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,420
Letting him go now means

69
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,390
letting the people behind him go free.

70
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,800
Let's sit down and talk this through.

71
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:54,519
What are you trying to say?

72
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,100
We have to continue the investigation.

73
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,439
It's the only way

74
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,439
to keep the girls in Buhe safe.

75
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,040
Director isn't here.

76
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,600
Give me a definite answer.

77
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,800
Can we continue?

78
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:10,800
Sure.

79
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,360
(Lei Nuo, Deputy Director)

80
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,879
(of Buhe City Police Station)
But have you considered how?

81
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,950
Song En has lost his mind.

82
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:18,720
His words can't be used as testimony.

83
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:20,600
As for that client list,

84
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:23,800
current law doesn't classify
buyers as criminals.

85
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:25,439
So, for the buyers,

86
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:27,240
it's a legal gray area.

87
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,040
The law won't do anything to them.

88
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,959
Or do you want to make the list public

89
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,480
and let public opinion condemn them?

90
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:40,240
Not exactly.

91
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:41,120
I just think...

92
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,759
That's enough.

93
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,759
Let's talk about Liao Siyuan.

94
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,199
What about him?

95
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,240
That boy's good.

96
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,680
I want to train him

97
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,190
by letting him assist
in the investigation.

98
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:58,800
But Liao Siyuan is still a student.

99
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,680
It doesn't seem appropriate.

100
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,000
Is that the problem,

101
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:05,759
or do you have a problem with him?

102
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:10,639
Shu He,

103
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,360
you handled Song En's case well.

104
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,160
But the award I applied for
on your behalf

105
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,480
still hasn't come through.

106
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,199
Do you know why?

107
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:28,600
Why did Song En insist
on killing Liao Siyuan?

108
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,759
Why did he turn himself in

109
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,160
after escaping?

110
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,120
What's the deal with the phone

111
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,279
inside Song En's stomach?

112
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,240
Was someone setting him up?

113
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,300
There are still many questions
unanswered in this case.

114
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,199
Correct.

115
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:44,519
And not just that.

116
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,120
Song En and Liao Siyuan are both

117
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,560
from Yong'an Village.

118
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:50,879
Exactly.

119
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:52,959
So,

120
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,700
if there's something more
to Liao Siyuan,

121
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,780
once he gets involved in the case,

122
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,399
he will definitely make a move.

123
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:02,480
This will make it easier
for us to monitor him

124
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:04,040
and catch him red-handed.

125
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,000
If he's innocent,

126
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:08,480
it means

127
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,240
someone is targeting him.

128
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:14,199
That would put him in danger.

129
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,240
Keeping him close
makes it easier to protect him.

130
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,180
Since you've said that,
Deputy Director Lei,

131
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,240
I'll just follow orders.

132
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,920
I'll get back to work now.

133
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:37,120
All right.

134
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:51,500
(Buhe City Psychiatric Hospital)

135
00:09:00,257 --> 00:09:02,460
(29 May 2009)

136
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:27,500
From the results of the enhanced MRI,

137
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:30,120
your brain's white matter
connecting the front and middle regions

138
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,500
is stronger than an average person.

139
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,240
That's why you have
an exceptional memory.

140
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,240
Such extraordinary memory

141
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,679
is usually triggered by a catalyst.

142
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:37,400
A single detail associated
with a memory

143
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,200
can instantly bring you
back to that moment.

144
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,780
Then your brain's left prefrontal cortex

145
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,320
experiences a rapid surge of blood flow.

146
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,300
which is dangerous.

147
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,550
If the memory isn't triggered
naturally by a catalyst...

148
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,740
But if you actively seek out

149
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,460
a certain memory,

150
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,159
your brain will be overloaded.

151
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,120
This could lead

152
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:53,039
to headaches, nausea, and vomiting.

153
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,240
In severe cases,
it could be life-threatening.

154
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:58,200
Siyuan,

155
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:00,360
that's what the doctor said.

156
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,519
Don't force yourself.

157
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,440
Humans forget

158
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:05,840
to protect themselves.

159
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:10,440
That is your memory palace,

160
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:11,639
not your prison.

161
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,120
Zhibai,

162
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:15,759
do you remember
what Song En said on the rooftop?

163
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,279
Going up against me

164
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:19,879
will only get you
the same fate as Liao Zhibai!

165
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:21,320
So what if he was good?

166
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,879
He messed with the wrong people!

167
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,559
He deserved to die in that fire!

168
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,600
Song En must know something

169
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,759
about that fire ten years ago.

170
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,640
I want to get to the bottom of it.

171
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,040
Song En has already lost his mind.

172
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,440
How can we still investigate?

173
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,160
Here's something you should know.

174
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,080
Song En's case isn't over yet.

175
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,290
You must cooperate with the police
in continuing the investigation

176
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,660
and assisting in solving the case.

177
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,740
Don't think
I want you involved in this case.

178
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,240
From now on, follow the rules.

179
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,300
Don't act on your own.

180
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:04,960
Dr. Qi already knows.

181
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,879
She agrees.

182
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,240
Even if you didn't tell me,

183
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,960
I would still investigate.

184
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:20,799
Because I don't trust you.

185
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,840
I won't let your classmate's sacrifice
be in vain.

186
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,480
No matter who is behind all this,

187
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:31,879
I will find them.

188
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,600
I keep my word.

189
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:43,679
Big talk.

190
00:11:58,038 --> 00:12:01,340
(Nu Na)

191
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:36,679
Hello?

192
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:37,919
Ms. Nu Na.

193
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:38,759
I'm very sorry.

194
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,960
Your pathology results show

195
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,680
that your melanoma
has reached stage three.

196
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,120
There is already invasive

197
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,220
and lymphatic metastasis.

198
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,820
Will you be available
for a follow-up appointment tomorrow?

199
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:52,440
Ms. Nu Na?

200
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,000
Sorry, I can't make it.

201
00:12:58,897 --> 00:13:00,650
(Anti-cancer medication)

202
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,440
(Does it hurt?)

203
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:11,480
(No.)

204
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,200
(2009, Yong'an Village)

205
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:13,960
If it hurts,

206
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,860
then you shouldn't be fighting
with other kids.

207
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:18,399
But they were bullying Su Pa.

208
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,360
I can't stand people
who bully little girls.

209
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,080
A great sense of justice
for someone so young.

210
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,080
Of course.

211
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,480
When I grow up,

212
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:30,879
I want to be a police officer
just like my brother.

213
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,000
I want there to be
no other darkness in the world

214
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,399
besides the night sky.

215
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:38,159
Then, if someone bullies me,

216
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,799
will you help me?

217
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,679
Of course.

218
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,120
Then work hard.

219
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,600
Sorry, Nu Na.

220
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,360
I'll pay you back.

221
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,799
You have money?

222
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,000
No, I don't.

223
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,639
Oh, right.

224
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,639
Look.

225
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:13,720
Will this work?

226
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,039
What's this?

227
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:17,240
A coupon.

228
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:19,200
I can grant you one wish.

229
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,120
Anything.

230
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:24,159
I promise I won't break my word.

231
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,320
Even though I stole that.

232
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:29,559
Okay.

233
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:30,919
Then I'll wait for the day

234
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:32,600
you make my wish come true.

235
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,519
Dad!

236
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:42,919
Mom!

237
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,320
Zhibai!

238
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,080
Si...

239
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:03,720
Who's there?

240
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,030
You jumped from the fifth floor

241
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,440
just to catch someone?

242
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:49,519
Don't worry.

243
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,519
Only I could pull
something like that off.

244
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,759
I won't do it again.

245
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,679
And he seems to have no memory

246
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,840
of jumping.

247
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,510
This could develop into a risk

248
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,040
of dissociative identity disorder.

249
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,160
What took you so long?

250
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,880
I had class this morning.

251
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:35,000
Officer,

252
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,700
if there's anything you need,
just tell me.

253
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,840
You have my full cooperation.

254
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,940
What are you doing here?

255
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,799
You don't know?

256
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,400
The last case still requires him

257
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:43,920
to come in a couple more times.

258
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,559
Shu He,

259
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,039
he's just a student.

260
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:52,359
I don't want him getting too involved.

261
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:53,559
Did you hear that?

262
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,200
I'm still a student.

263
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,580
I'm going back to school.

264
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,720
Cooperate properly.

265
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,720
Once you're done,
go straight back to school.

266
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:04,559
Whose side are you on?

267
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,680
Did you hear her? Cooperate properly.

268
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:09,480
Sit there and cooperate.

269
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,279
Good luck, young man.

270
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Back in my day,
when I came to the police station,

271
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,880
Director himself
would personally receive me.

272
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,400
Back then, Shu He was a model student

273
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,220
and even he didn't get
this kind of treatment.

274
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:28,790
Zhibai.

275
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,759
You're old.

276
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:32,880
Why?

277
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:33,759
When a person

278
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:35,960
is always reminiscing the good old days,

279
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:37,680
it means they're old.

280
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,000
Oh, Siyuan.

281
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:43,880
I'm not old.

282
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,559
I'm dead.

283
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,880
Check this for me.

284
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,599
You're Liao Siyuan, right?

285
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,319
Yes.

286
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,519
These are the case files
for Song En's case.

287
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,240
See if there's anything
that needs to be added.

288
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:14,960
All of these?

289
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:16,799
Officer Shu He instructed us

290
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,789
not to overlook any details.

291
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,420
If there's anything
you don't understand,

292
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,300
feel free to ask me.

293
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:23,720
My desk is in that corner.

294
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,279
One more thing.

295
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,400
The information of these victims

296
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,540
must be kept confidential.

297
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:30,799
If it gets leaked,

298
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,799
it would be
a second round of harm to them.

299
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,640
I'll leave you to go through them.

300
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,799
A good police officer

301
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,440
must have empathy.

302
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,440
Looks like not everyone
in this department

303
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,039
is a cold-blooded machine like Shu He.

304
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,240
A real good cop needs

305
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,440
to be ruthless and efficient
to solve cases.

306
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,279
Excessive empathy clouds judgment.

307
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:14,880
But at least

308
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,160
this is a good chance

309
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,640
to access Song En's case files.

310
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:19,559
At the very least,

311
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,279
we can find out
who he was connected to ten years ago.

312
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:31,359
Siyuan,

313
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:33,160
it's just a few pages.

314
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,039
Why are you taking so long?

315
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,240
Are you sure you can do this?

316
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,880
You call this a few pages?

317
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:44,559
This is so boring.

318
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:47,440
I wish there was a new case.

319
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,680
I hope there will never be another case.

320
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,039
No murderers.

321
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:54,559
No victims.

322
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,160
Well said.

323
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,400
I support you.

324
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:02,680
Keep it up.

325
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,240
Isn't that Nu Na?

326
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,039
She's from Yong'an Village, isn't she?

327
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:18,039
She now runs a bridal shop.

328
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:19,920
I never expected her to be a victim too.

329
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,900
She could very well be the first one.

330
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,549
Criminal psychology says
that psychopaths usually start

331
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:26,800
with people close to them.

332
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,440
She is Song En's niece.

333
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,750
Song En has gone mad now.

334
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,319
Maybe she knows something

335
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,720
about the fire ten years ago.

336
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:34,960
But if she's doing fine now,

337
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,119
wouldn't confronting her

338
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,160
just reopen her old wounds?

339
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,920
What do you think is more important?

340
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,119
Her old wounds

341
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,240
or the truth about our family?

342
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,039
(Recently,)

343
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,560
(the Buhe City police department)

344
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,270
(busted an organized prostitution ring.)

345
00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:57,119
(12 suspects were arrested.)

346
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,799
(This group was involved
in multiple criminal activities,)

347
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,570
(including coercing women
into prostitution, illegal confinement,)

348
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,279
(and selling eggs for surrogacy.)

349
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,559
(The total amount involved
exceeded 15 million yuan.)

350
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,920
(The ringleader, Song En,
has turned himself in.)

351
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,000
(The investigation)

352
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:17,480
(is still ongoing.)

353
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:22,400
Help! Help!

354
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,480
Stop struggling.

355
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,000
Your uncle already sold you to me.

356
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,620
(Last night's wedding dress
was a gift for our first meeting.)

357
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,160
(Come out and meet me.)

358
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,750
(Serendipity Bridal Shop)

359
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:22,400
She's not here?

360
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:25,839
Nu Na probably won't be coming in today.

361
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,000
You should leave.

362
00:23:30,039 --> 00:23:31,440
Can I wait here?

363
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,580
I promise
I won't interfere with your work.

364
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,200
(Jin, Bridal Shop Employee)

365
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,680
Fine, you can stay,

366
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,680
but don't touch anything.

367
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:41,519
If someone keeps avoiding you,

368
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,039
it means your presence

369
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,400
is making them uneasy.

370
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:48,000
That suggests they do know something.

371
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:48,960
Right?

372
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,599
Welcome.

373
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:55,279
I'm here
for my wedding dress appointment.

374
00:23:56,279 --> 00:23:57,200
Siyuan, hide!

375
00:23:58,319 --> 00:23:59,119
Hurry!

376
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:00,860
Please let me know

377
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,520
if you have any other requests, Miss.

378
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,590
Nothing too flashy.
Something practical and easy to move in.

379
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:06,880
Understood.

380
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,039
You prefer a minimalist style.

381
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,119
May I take a closer look?

382
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,720
This dress suits you very well.

383
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,700
Why is she here alone
trying on a wedding dress?

384
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,920
I'll come back tomorrow.

385
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,519
All right.

386
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:30,279
I'll walk you downstairs.

387
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,640
Who's the guy?

388
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:52,780
He's been recently transferred
to Buhe City's police station.

389
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,590
Probably a graduate
from your police academy too.

390
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:57,160
I think his name was Ou Wen.

391
00:24:58,359 --> 00:24:59,000
Is that so?

392
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,519
Then it's fine.

393
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,119
It's probably just work.

394
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,400
I think it's more than that.

395
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:13,279
These past few days,

396
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,480
it's been him picking her up after work.

397
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,519
Chatting and bantering.

398
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,400
They seem pretty close.

399
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,039
I'm 100% sure

400
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:27,240
he's not her type.

401
00:25:37,771 --> 00:25:40,520
(Qi's Pharmacy)

402
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,400
No class today, Siyuan?

403
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,559
No.

404
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,300
Here to get some medicine
for Ms. Meihua.

405
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,079
Hello.

406
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,039
How can I help you?

407
00:25:57,799 --> 00:25:58,680
Does your old promise

408
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:00,880
still count?

409
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,279
Long time no see.

410
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,759
Long time no see.

411
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,599
You've grown so tall.

412
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,559
Where are you going?

413
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:28,920
I just remembered
I left some medicine boiling inside.

414
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,359
I'll go check on it.

415
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:31,160
You two carry on.

416
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:31,720
Wait...

417
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,799
I went looking for you.

418
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:39,160
I know.

419
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:40,680
Then why didn't you meet me?

420
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,680
I did see you.

421
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,590
At the psychiatric hospital.

422
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,510
You were there to see Song En.

423
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:53,400
I only recently found out

424
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,799
what Song En did to you.

425
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,599
I'm really sorry.

426
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,680
Why are you apologizing?

427
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:08,519
Everything that happened

428
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,559
had nothing to do with you.

429
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,039
Besides,

430
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,640
you helped me catch Song En.

431
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,559
I should be the one thanking you.

432
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:21,880
I promised

433
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,759
to protect you.

434
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:25,640
To keep you from getting hurt.

435
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:28,759
But I failed.

436
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,759
Don't be sad.

437
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:40,039
It's not too late for you

438
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,880
to protect me.

439
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,400
I think someone's been following me.

440
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,279
Look.

441
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:51,119
Meet me at Meet Bar at 9 PM.

442
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:52,279
I have something for you.

443
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:53,440
What is it?

444
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:57,039
The truth about that fire.

445
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:11,480
(8:50 PM at Meet Bar)

446
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,480
First time here, handsome?

447
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,120
Want me to have a drink with you?

448
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:40,720
I really don't know what happened.

449
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,279
She just kept staring at me.

450
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,359
According to your records,

451
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:53,000
Nu Na was your second wife, correct?

452
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,721
(Cha Peng, Nu Na's Husband)

453
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:56,319
Yes.

454
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:00,519
My ex-wife died in a car accident.

455
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,559
It was Nu Na who helped me move on.

456
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,920
That's why we got married so quickly.

457
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:14,119
Chief.

458
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,790
Forensics just sent over the report.

459
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,720
Him again?

460
00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:41,240
A few hours ago, we received a report.

461
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:44,440
A female corpse
was found at a bridal shop.

462
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,000
The victim's name is Nu Na.

463
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,359
She was the owner of the shop.

464
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,000
What's the victim's name?

465
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:54,279
Nu Na.

466
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,880
According to the forensic report,

467
00:30:57,119 --> 00:30:58,480
the time of her death was between

468
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,880
10 PM and midnight yesterday.

469
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:01,799
We found this
in the surveillance footage

470
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:02,799
near the bridal shop.

471
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,519
What were you doing?

472
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:22,830
Why were you chasing her?

473
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,839
We were supposed to meet,

474
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,790
but she never showed up.

475
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:36,960
The next time I saw her

476
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:39,160
was at her shop entrance.

477
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:41,559
I was just passing by.

478
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,000
She was walking out of her shop.

479
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,000
When?

480
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,550
The night of the incident.

481
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,720
Nu Na!

482
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,750
I waited for you all night!
Why didn't you come?

483
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,400
Nu Na!

484
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,759
Nu Na!

485
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:17,519
Are you sure the victim is Nu Na?

486
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:33,920
That smile... Could it be...

487
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:36,079
That's right. It's just like Lai La.

488
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,319
But unlike Lai La,

489
00:32:39,319 --> 00:32:41,319
who had injection marks on her body,

490
00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:43,240
I can't find

491
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:46,359
a single open wound

492
00:32:46,359 --> 00:32:47,279
on Nu Na's body.

493
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:55,960
Scissors.

494
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,830
The bridal shop
was the primary crime scene.

495
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,920
The shop's surveillance

496
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,359
wasn't tampered with.

497
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,599
It was turned off.

498
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:11,920
That means the culprit

499
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,359
was very familiar

500
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:14,319
with the crime scene.

501
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,480
So, we focused the investigation
on the employees

502
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,920
and people close to the victim.

503
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,480
But they all had alibis.

504
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:22,460
Most were eliminated from suspicion
in the first round of investigation.

505
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,240
Did you check the surveillance

506
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,200
near the bridal shop?

507
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,680
There are no cameras on the street.

508
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,880
But the antique store
across the road has one.

509
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,359
They close at 10:30 PM.

510
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,540
They turn on their surveillance
after they close.

511
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,750
That's the camera
that caught Liao Siyuan.

512
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,039
That kid...

513
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,119
Every single murder case

514
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:50,720
is somehow connected to him.

515
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,000
Is this just a coincidence?

516
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,480
He's...

517
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,760
The autopsy results are out.

518
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:23,320
The victim had malignant melanoma.

519
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:24,280
Seems like

520
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,380
it has already progressed
to at least stage three.

521
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,900
Was that the cause of death?

522
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,119
No.

523
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,420
The cause of death
matches poisoning symptoms,

524
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,460
but the exact substance
is difficult to identify.

525
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,380
I've sent the victim's
fingernails and hair

526
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,200
for further testing.

527
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,520
We'll have the results tomorrow.

528
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:40,760
Is it the same drug

529
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,800
found in Lai La's body?

530
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,079
Not sure.

531
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,190
I couldn't find a single open wound

532
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:47,599
on the victim's entire body.

533
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,159
Never mind a needle mark.

534
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,159
I have no idea how the killer

535
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:52,800
managed to poison her.

536
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,760
Sure there's not a single wound?

537
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,639
Do you think it was a vengeful ghost?

538
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,199
You're a seasoned cop,

539
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,360
and that's your deduction?

540
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,719
Sir,

541
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,400
because I'm a seasoned cop,

542
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,480
I've seen everything.

543
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,840
But this is the first time

544
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,159
I've seen something this bizarre.

545
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:17,760
She died

546
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:20,000
wearing a wedding dress.

547
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,760
And that smile was still on her face.

548
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,559
It's as if

549
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:24,039
death wasn't painful at all.

550
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:24,719
Instead...

551
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:28,100
Instead, it was like
she had fulfilled her wish.

552
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,600
If that's not the work
of a ghost, then what is?

553
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:46,079
Are you all right?

554
00:35:56,199 --> 00:35:58,440
I need to get out of here
before school ends.

555
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:01,000
I can't let Ms. Meihua
find out about this.

556
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,159
But that night,

557
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:05,639
we definitely saw Nu Na after 11 PM.

558
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,060
And there's surveillance footage
to prove it.

559
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,000
If she really died

560
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,519
after that time,

561
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:12,880
I have no way to prove my innocence.

562
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,760
Calm down.

563
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,380
Let's go over everything again.

564
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:17,519
From what we know,

565
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,639
Nu Na's body was discovered last night

566
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:21,400
after the bridal shop had closed.

567
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:22,639
The police concluded

568
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:23,840
that she died

569
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,679
between 10 PM and 12 AM, right?

570
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,599
Yes.

571
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:29,119
She never showed up at Meet Bar.

572
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,520
So the shop was the primary crime scene.

573
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,640
(Wedding Dress)
So at some point,

574
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,340
she must have returned
to the bridal shop.

575
00:36:34,519 --> 00:36:36,400
Do you remember
anything else from that night?

576
00:36:47,754 --> 00:36:50,430
(7:40 PM)

577
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:53,599
7:40 PM.

578
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:56,000
This wedding dress

579
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,800
weighs around three kilograms.

580
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,000
It's complicated to put on.

581
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,680
Even a living person would have trouble

582
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,720
dressing themselves in it.

583
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,140
A corpse usually enters rigor mortis

584
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,160
about an hour after death.

585
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,420
If the body was transported back
to the shop and then dressed,

586
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,270
it'd be hard to do so.

587
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:09,340
So the wedding dress was either
put on her while she was alive,

588
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,510
or immediately after she died.

589
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:12,640
The bridal shop was definitely
the first crime scene.

590
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,119
But it's been sitting here for days.

591
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:18,880
It hasn't changed at all.

592
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:28,199
Siyuan!

593
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:29,640
(10:54 PM)
You came to pick me up?

594
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,500
I'm not here for you.

595
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:32,250
I have something to do.
Go home by yourself.

596
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,079
What did he say?

597
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:34,119
I didn't catch a word.

598
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:42,199
10:54 PM.

599
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,920
The position of her arm.

600
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,519
It changed.

601
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,400
This is Nu Na.

602
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,360
That means

603
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,480
she was already dead

604
00:37:56,639 --> 00:37:57,639
before 10:54 PM.

605
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,480
So the person we saw
after 11 PM wasn't Nu Na.

606
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,740
It was most likely the killer.
