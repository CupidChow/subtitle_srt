00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,290
(Year 2011, Bocai Floating Market)
It's not easy for us to make money.

2
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:16,920
I don't want to spend my whole life here,

3
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,240
watching other people's moods.

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,320
What do you want to do in the future?

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,079
I want to be a celebrity!

6
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:24,920
I want to star in films!

7
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:27,199
I want everyone

8
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:28,960
to see me on TV!

9
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:29,800
Sure.

10
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:31,480
I want to open a bridal shop.

11
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:33,159
When all of you get married,

12
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,240
I'll take care of your wedding dresses.

13
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,320
I'm not getting married.

14
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,960
I'll wear your wedding dress

15
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:41,159
and marry a handsome guy
like Leslie Cheung.

16
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:43,399
I want the whole world
to envy me and drool over me.

17
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:44,679
Be realistic.

18
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:45,920
Leslie belongs to all of us.

19
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,920
How could he be yours?

20
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,880
I have a good mindset.

21
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:48,759
I'll take my time.

22
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:51,439
What about you?

23
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,719
I just want to be with the people

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:55,679
I care about forever.

25
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,119
You're a hopeless romantic.

26
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,200
Take my advice.

27
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,400
Don't take it too seriously.

28
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:03,380
You'll get hurt easily.

29
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,040
Mind your own business.

30
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,719
Can it be called love

31
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,120
if you don't get hurt?

32
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:09,920
You're right.

33
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:11,480
What about you?

34
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,359
Any wishes?

35
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:19,280
I want a home.

36
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,879
I want a home.

37
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,079
I want

38
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:27,439
a father and a mother,

39
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,439
but this wish will never come true.

40
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:33,959
It's okay. I'll change it.

41
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,599
I want to have a lot of money.

42
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:42,920
I can make

43
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,920
a lot of money!

44
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:46,079
Well said!

45
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,920
It's better to rely on yourself.

46
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:49,719
Then

47
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,150
may our dreams come true.

48
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,920
- May our dreams come true!
- May our dreams come true!

49
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,960
It's you.

50
00:02:58,919 --> 00:02:59,919
Did you kill Nu Na?

51
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,159
Stop there.

52
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,039
Stop!

53
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,240
Stop!

54
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,159
Xu Man, come out!

57
00:05:38,145 --> 00:05:41,670
(Year 1998)

58
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,240
How could you be so cruel?

59
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:50,639
Don't leave.

60
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,120
Okay?

61
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,639
What's the use
of this androgynous thing to me?

62
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:02,879
You can't abandon her.

63
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:09,680
She's your biological daughter.

64
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,199
Stop!

65
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,120
Don't run!

66
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,839
Don't run! Stop! Don't run!

67
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:06,399
My parents are dead.

68
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,519
What about yours?

69
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:11,560
My dad doesn't want us.

70
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:15,480
Why don't you

71
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:18,600
be my sister?

72
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:20,079
I want you.

73
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:23,720
Okay, I'll protect you from now on.

74
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:49,959
I did this all by myself.

75
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,160
It has nothing to do with her.

76
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:57,360
She still thinks she owes me.

77
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,360
What a fool.

78
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,439
Xiaotang loves
spicy and sour chicken feet.

79
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,920
We agreed to open a food stall

80
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,040
and live our own life

81
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,560
when we made enough money.

82
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,560
We almost saved up enough money.

83
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:30,000
I already found a shop,

84
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,320
but on my way home,

85
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,279
I never imagined

86
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,320
seeing such a scene

87
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,720
when I saw her again.

88
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,240
Hurry. There's no time.

89
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,080
Xiaotang.

90
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,600
Xiaotang, wake up.

91
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,990
What are you all standing there for?

92
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,870
Hurry over and help.

93
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:57,320
No, it's too dangerous.

94
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,759
Run!

95
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:27,159
That woman's dead.

96
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,279
Lan Xiaotang drove the car.

97
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,120
This has nothing to do with us.

98
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:38,519
Xiaotang.

99
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,039
Calm down and listen to me.

100
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:42,799
Look at me.

101
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:44,639
Xiaotang.

102
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:47,720
Look at me.

103
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,360
I've already booked
a plane ticket for you.

104
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,879
Take this letter to the southeast

105
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:58,080
to lay low for a while.

106
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,200
I'll take care

107
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,039
of the rest for you.

108
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:09,399
What's wrong?

109
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:13,039
But someone's already dead.

110
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,639
How could you solve it?

111
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,080
The other party was the one
to violate the rules first.

112
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,519
And listen to me.

113
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,240
I bribed a policeman named Luo Si.

114
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:29,399
It'll be alright.

115
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,919
Go to the southeast

116
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,159
and stay there.

117
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,639
I'll call you

118
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:38,600
as soon as I finish everything.

119
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,519
You can then come back.

120
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,559
Silly girl.

121
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,380
Don't be scared.

122
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,480
I'm here for you.

123
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,639
So

124
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,270
I tricked her into taking the letter
back to the southeast.

125
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:06,720
There

126
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,159
will be everything she wants.

127
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:14,759
She'll have a home, parents,

128
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:18,600
and money.

129
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,799
When she comes back for me,

130
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:26,879
I'll be in jail as her.

131
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,039
Perfect.

132
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:55,720
My child.

133
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:57,960
You've had a long journey.

134
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:00,279
Father.

135
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:02,679
I'm Xu Man.

136
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,519
After I arrived in the southeast,

137
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,720
she didn't call me as agreed.

138
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,140
I couldn't get in touch with her either.

139
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I could only wait.

140
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,759
I waited for the opportunity
to go back and find her.

141
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:21,960
Finally,

142
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,879
after I inherited
the Xu family's business,

143
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:29,519
I returned to Buhe City

144
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:32,879
and asked around
for information about her.

145
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,679
Only then did I realize

146
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:39,919
that

147
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,919
she had gone to jail for me.

148
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,790
And she had already been released.

149
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:51,559
No one knew

150
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:53,480
where she went after she was released.

151
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,519
I used all my connections

152
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:57,960
to find out about one person.

153
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,840
She often visited Xu Man

154
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:03,399
while she was in jail.

155
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,159
This person is An Ni.

156
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:11,799
When I found An Ni, she told me...

157
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:14,519
Leave.

158
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,159
She has left Buhe City.

159
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,399
I told An Ni

160
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,480
to tell Xiaotang
that I had left Buhe City

161
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:31,919
if Xiaotang came looking for me.

162
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:38,799
But I didn't expect

163
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,879
these women to take photos

164
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:43,480
of Xiaotang's car accident

165
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:46,039
and use them to threaten Xiaotang.

166
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,440
I'm not interested in the dirty things

167
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,679
they do,

168
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,799
but I won't allow anyone

169
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:57,440
to disturb Xiaotang's life.

170
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,639
That's the only thing I can give her.

171
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,780
When I learned
that Xiaotang had come to Buhe City,

172
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:30,759
I decided to see her secretly.

173
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:34,360
I just watched her from afar.

174
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:38,600
She finally had the life she wanted.

175
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:47,240
But I ran into an acquaintance

176
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:50,399
just when I was leaving.

177
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:33,919
Do you think she will come?

178
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,480
Would she not come
after seeing such photos?

179
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,879
She's really lucky.

180
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:42,440
She should have gone to jail.

181
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,159
Instead, she transformed

182
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:46,000
into a rich heiress.

183
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:48,799
What do you think will happen

184
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:50,759
if her covetous uncles, cousins,

185
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:53,159
and other relatives find out

186
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:54,919
about this matter?

187
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,080
They'll send her to jail, of course.

188
00:15:57,919 --> 00:15:59,840
And that androgynous Xu Man

189
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:02,799
gave false testimony,

190
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:05,519
which is a serious crime.

191
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,039
Ladies.

192
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:17,799
Long time no see.

193
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,840
It's been ten years.

194
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,080
We were friends.

195
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,540
I have only one thing to say.

196
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:31,799
If you dare to disturb Lan Xiaotang,

197
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,639
I will kill you.

198
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:57,120
Don't you find it twisted?

199
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,320
I would go to Meet Bar

200
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,679
to have some fun

201
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:07,119
after I got my salary.

202
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,920
I always asked for Lin.

203
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:13,519
After we finished drinking that day,

204
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:15,799
she drove home with her friends.

205
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:16,799
Who's driving?

206
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,400
Me!

207
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,270
Forget it. Your driving skills suck.

208
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,680
I'll do it.

209
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,119
Let's go back and drink.

210
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,759
Don't throw up.

211
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,720
Don't waste the wine.

212
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:28,359
Just hold it in. We'll be home soon.

213
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,720
We'll be home soon.

214
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:41,920
Switch her over.

215
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:43,839
Hurry.

216
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:48,680
No.

217
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,680
This is what the surveillance camera

218
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,359
filmed that night.

219
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:03,839
Man Ni promised me

220
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:05,799
that she'd ask Lin

221
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:07,079
to keep me company

222
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,200
as long as I erased
the surveillance footage

223
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,960
of the night of the car accident.

224
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:14,079
But who knew

225
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:16,319
she would film this

226
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:17,440
to blackmail me.

227
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:18,079
I...

228
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:20,799
I...

229
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,519
I had no choice but to help them

230
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,079
destroy a lot of criminal evidence.

231
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,319
Later, I received another call

232
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:35,279
from Xu Man.

233
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,559
She probably didn't know

234
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,720
that Lan Xiaotang
wasn't the one driving the car.

235
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:39,720
She asked me to help her

236
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:42,000
go to jail as Lan Xiaotang.

237
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,680
I agreed.

238
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,759
Soon after I returned to the southeast,

239
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,319
I received a letter from Buhe City.

240
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,759
So I went back to Buhe City.

241
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:05,759
When I arrived, I found

242
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:08,640
that Nu Na and Man Ni were already dead.

243
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,799
I was late.

244
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,759
Xu Man must have

245
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,039
done this for me.

246
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,319
That fool.

247
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:34,160
Why did you get plastic surgery?

248
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:37,960
Officer.

249
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:40,640
I've been in jail before.

250
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,920
I don't want to live
as my old self anymore.

251
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:46,400
I want to live with a new identity

252
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:49,039
and even gender.

253
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:53,640
Only when I disappear from this world

254
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:57,680
can Lan Xiaotang truly become Xu Man.

255
00:19:59,084 --> 00:20:01,480
(In Operation)

256
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,270
The operation was successful.

257
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:14,400
Thank you.

258
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,740
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

259
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:56,279
Finally,

260
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:02,079
I disappeared completely.

261
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,680
Where did you get the AH7
you used to kill people?

262
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,839
I bought them all on the dark web.

263
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:17,440
One-way transaction.

264
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,480
I don't know who they are either.

265
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,559
Officer.

266
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:37,000
Can I make one more request?

Please wait.

286
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:31,440
Liao Siyuan.

287
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,550
What's the matter?

288
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:36,440
I want to have a word with her.

289
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,720
What's there to talk about?

290
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,240
You shouldn't have killed Nu Na.

291
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,319
It's not just you and Lan Xiaotang

292
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,000
who have kept their promise.

293
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,960
She kept hers too.

294
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,759
She didn't have much time left.

295
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,240
Even if you don't kill her,

296
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:23,759
she will die.

297
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,519
She had melanoma,

298
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,720
stage three.

299
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,160
The doctor said her condition

300
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,440
could worsen at any time.

301
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,640
She had two last wishes

302
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:42,440
before she died.

303
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,920
One was me,

304
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,110
and the other was all of you.

305
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:53,319
She used all her money

306
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,640
to exchange for a future
for you and Lan Xiaotang.

307
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,599
Don't you find it twisted?

308
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:11,160
Can you please stop disturbing them?

309
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:14,640
What do you mean?

310
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,880
If you want money,

311
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,079
I can pay you.

312
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,380
I just think we shouldn't forget
the promise we made

313
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:27,119
because we were so close back then.

314
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,079
Are you okay?

315
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:31,200
Close my foot.

316
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,920
Are you the only one who took it seriously?

317
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,480
There's no one else between them.

318
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:42,600
Are you trying to atone for your sins
after doing a lot of bad things?

319
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:44,240
Fine, Nu Na.

320
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,560
As long as you give me money,

321
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,160
I'm fine with anything.

322
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,359
Nu Na always complained about being poor,

323
00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:52,519
but took out

324
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
such a large sum of money
before she died.

325
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,039
Thank you.

326
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,079
You had a chance

327
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,640
to live a peaceful life.

328
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,720
But because of you,

329
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,319
neither of her two wishes

330
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:27,720
were fulfilled.

331
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,400
How great would it be

332
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,960
if the five of us could be the same

333
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,359
as when we first met?

334
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,559
If I had met you earlier,

335
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,960
would the ending be different?

336
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,559
I think this river

337
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,200
is where Nu Na

338
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,799
and her friends first met.

339
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,519
Compared with Man Ni and Lin,

340
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,880
Nu Na isn't a completely bad person.

341
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:13,640
Of course.

342
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,119
She's not a good person either.

343
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:20,359
Her family hurt her.

344
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,359
Her husband betrayed her.

345
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,799
Her friends threatened her.

346
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,359
She was trapped by fate

347
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:34,160
with no way out.

348
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,540
She didn't even know where to go
after she died.

349
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:44,160
Regardless of whether

350
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:46,279
she changed her mind before she died,

351
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,880
it was precisely because of her silence

352
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,079
and inaction

353
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:55,200
that our case has remained unsolved

354
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,119
for so many years.

355
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,759
I don't know

356
00:29:58,759 --> 00:29:59,720
if I can forgive her.

357
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:01,920
But sometimes I wonder

358
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:05,240
how we can demand justice

359
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:08,799
from a person

360
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:12,480
when they're just trying to survive?

361
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,260
I originally thought
that the real culprit of this case

362
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:19,119
would be related to the fire.

363
00:30:20,359 --> 00:30:21,640
After all the investigation,

364
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,119
the only clue we have left is AH7.

365
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,440
If we have a chance,

366
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,400
let's ask Xu Man

367
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:31,279
where she got AH7.

I want everyone

376
00:30:59,119 --> 00:30:59,680
Sure.

377
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:01,440
I want to open a bridal shop.

378
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,119
When all of you get married,

379
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,160
I'll take care of your wedding dresses.

380
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,799
I'll wear your wedding dress

381
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:09,799
and marry a handsome guy
like Leslie Cheung.

382
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:12,079
I want the whole world
to envy me and drool over me.

383
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:13,359
Forget about it.

Happy birthday, Liao Zhibai.

395
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:13,160
Please enter.

396
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,000
Tie Xin.

397
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,000
Tie Xin.

398
00:33:46,119 --> 00:33:47,599
Calm down.

399
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:53,039
The restaurant's surveillance cameras
have been turned off.

400
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,799
The car you drove

401
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,640
doesn't have any dashcam either.

402
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,839
Half an hour ago,

403
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,200
your family received a notification

404
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,039
of your emergency business trip.

405
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:07,440
You should understand

406
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:09,880
what I mean by telling you this.

407
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:10,920
Tie Xin.

408
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,360
What I mean

409
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,639
is that no one will notice

410
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,000
if I kill you now.

411
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,280
Tie Xin, calm down.

412
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,119
If you have something to say, go ahead.

413
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:25,840
Let me ask you.

414
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:29,320
Where did the AH7
leaked from these murders

415
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,519
come from?

416
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:33,440
My factory

417
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,760
is the only one in Buhe City
that can produce AH7.

418
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,079
Give me a few days.

419
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,159
I'll find it.

420
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:40,960
A few days.

421
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:07,760
Did I hurt you just now?

422
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:10,679
Have some meat.

423
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,519
After you, Tie Xin.

424
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:22,519
Three things.

425
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,519
First...

426
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:32,760
Yummy.

427
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:38,239
What Sir means

428
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:42,519
is that Liao Siyuan
doesn't pose any threat now.

429
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:45,760
Killing a person
is troublesome after all.

430
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:48,760
Find a way

431
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,760
to get him to go away.

432
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,039
Got it.

433
00:35:55,159 --> 00:35:55,719
Second,

434
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,880
find out who in the factory leaked AH7

435
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,639
as soon as possible.

436
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,039
You have five days at most.

437
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,400
Yes.

438
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:09,199
One last thing.

439
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,679
Find him for me

440
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:16,199
and inform me.

441
00:36:17,559 --> 00:36:18,719
I'll take care of him myself.

442
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:22,880
Who's this?

443
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,559
Liao Zhibai's classmate.

444
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,480
Bai Han.

445
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,400
Bai Han?

446
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:45,760
I told you
everything I needed to tell you.

447
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:47,440
Why did you still look for me?

448
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:54,760
AH7 is hard to get.

449
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,140
You were in jail for seven years.

450
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,480
Isn't it Lan Xiaotang

451
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,000
who uses her connections to help you?

452
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,440
And Lan Xiaotang...

453
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,519
I told you.

454
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:04,039
This matter has nothing to do with her.

455
00:37:04,039 --> 00:37:05,639
I did it all by myself.

456
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:07,639
She isn't the one who killed you.

457
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:15,440
Who is it then?

458
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,039
Tell me.

459
00:38:00,519 --> 00:38:01,519
How can you help me?

460
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,320
Looks like you went here by yourself.

461
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,719
Throw the phone into the bucket
in front of you and destroy it.

462
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,079
I'll tell you face to face.

463
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,519
Who is he?

464
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:31,760
I don't know who he is.

465
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,280
The unfinished building was too dark.

466
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,760
I can't see his face clearly.

467
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,230
Which unfinished building?

468
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,199
I can't tell you.

469
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:44,000
Why?

470
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,079
This matter is very important to me.

471
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,719
When I was most desperate,

472
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,679
someone lit a lamp for me
in the dark night.

473
00:38:58,199 --> 00:39:00,519
I know full well
that it's like a moth to a flame,

474
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:03,480
but I have no choice.

475
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:13,239
Visiting time is up. Time to go.

476
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,599
Here.

477
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:41,679
This isn't
the direction back to the cell.

478
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:44,239
Your medical parole has been approved.

479
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,639
You can leave right away.

480
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:50,719
Medical parole?

481
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:53,039
Go.

482
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:55,039
I didn't apply
for medical parole, Officer.

483
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:55,800
Go.

484
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,840
