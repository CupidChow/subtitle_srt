1
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,679
(Year 2009)
No, you don't know anyone.

2
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,240
Don't worry.

3
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,650
My teacher had already written me
a letter of recommendation.

4
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,160
Your daughter is so good...

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,120
Your daughter's so good.

6
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:28,679
Why worry about her job?

7
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,017
(Ti Yi)

8
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:33,479
You sent me something again.

9
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:35,759
Yeah, open it up.

10
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,600
Is it nice? Do you like it?

11
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,600
It's nice. It's so beautiful!

12
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:49,580
I made it.

13
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,100
How is it? It's not as bad
as the ones they sell outside, is it?

14
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,600
(Man Ni)
Mrs. Ti, the dress looks great.

15
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,280
Make me one too.

16
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,640
Okay.

17
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,560
You're everywhere.

18
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,439
This is my mom.

19
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:04,040
Mom,

20
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,319
what made you think
of making me a dress?

21
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,519
It's not a cheap fabric, is it?

22
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,880
You haven't bought a new dress
in so long.

23
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,239
Graduation is coming up.

24
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,640
Didn't you say you were going
to perform on stage?

25
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:17,120
You need a decent costume.

26
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,400
Thanks, Mom.

27
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,200
Right, Mom.

28
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,959
I got you a present too.

29
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:27,400
It's a lipstick.

30
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,400
You'll get it in two days.

31
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,239
Thanks, my girl.

32
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,220
I won't keep you from studying.

33
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,200
Go and get busy.

34
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:35,480
Bye, Mom.

35
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:42,480
A letter of recommendation?

36
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:45,239
You can't lie to your mom like this
for long.

37
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,280
She'll find out one day.

38
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,760
What can I do?

39
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,359
I can't let her worry.

40
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,220
I've been going to job fairs
for two months,

41
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,700
but I haven't heard a thing.

42
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:01,040
If I'd known it was so hard
to find a job,

43
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,400
I wouldn't have learned vocal music
in the first place.

44
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:13,479
Right, Man Ni.

45
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:15,439
You have lots of friends.

46
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:17,599
Do you have connections for me?

47
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:20,000
I don't have connections.

48
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:23,879
But you got a job.

49
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:26,319
You... Can you help me?

50
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:28,680
I'm really at my wit's end.

51
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:32,560
Man Ni, please help me.

52
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,599
Man Ni, nice Man Ni.

53
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:36,000
Nice Man Ni, you're the best.

54
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,919
Okay.

55
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,680
There's a party tonight.

56
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:44,479
Why don't you dress up

57
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,639
and come with me?

58
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,280
I'll see if I can

59
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,039
introduce you to someone there.

60
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:51,520
Love you so much.

61
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,159
You've ruined my makeup.

62
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,960
Is... Is this the place?

63
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:42,639
Hi.

64
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:44,600
Hi.

65
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:49,600
You smell so good.

69
00:06:33,952 --> 00:06:35,230
(Year 2009)

70
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,680
When did you get here?

71
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,960
Are you done watching the CCTV footage?
How is it?

72
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:51,560
What about you?

73
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,720
Any new leads?

74
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:02,759
I've been checking around the highway
where they were last seen for days,

75
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,060
but nothing has been found.

76
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,759
I ordered the search to stop yesterday.

77
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,160
This explosion has caused

78
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,480
such a social uproar.

79
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,720
I think that's what they want

80
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,879
so they won't hide.

81
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:17,879
But in the past few days,

82
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,880
I've been thinking about something else.

83
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,199
All the previous victims

84
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,720
appeared in Na Wa's camera.

85
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:32,000
Except for Liu Haixun.

86
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,160
So did he die accidentally

87
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,959
or did they deliberately kill him?

88
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:39,360
He knew Tie Xin.

89
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,319
He must be involved.

90
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,199
Ten years ago,

91
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,519
he worked as a security guard in a bar.

92
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:49,720
Strangely enough,

93
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,519
he quit after a few days,

94
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,519
became a big boss

95
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,280
and joined the Buhe Chamber of Commerce

96
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,820
to start building connections.

97
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:01,040
I compared the times.

98
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,120
He made his fortune

99
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,639
around the time
of your family's accident.

100
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,120
Plus, the dried fruit factory

101
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,340
was found to be manufacturing
and transporting drugs.

102
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,319
It's obvious

103
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,279
that he found a big shot

104
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,399
to back him up at that period of time.

105
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:19,959
That's him, Tie Xin.

106
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,959
We've put out a city-wide wanted notice.

107
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,360
I believe we'll arrest him soon.

108
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,360
I also think
there's something suspicious

109
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,159
about the case ten years ago.

110
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,980
But the evidence was so strong

111
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,460
that I couldn't do anything about it.

112
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,720
But this time is different.

113
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,679
New clues have appeared,

114
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,320
pointing directly
to the fire at Liao's house.

115
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:59,519
I'm going to ask my superiors
to set up a task force

116
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,160
to re-investigate that year's case.

117
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,720
Together with the explosion case

118
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,200
this time.

119
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,360
Good job, young man.

120
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,360
Your perseverance is worth it.

121
00:09:20,195 --> 00:09:22,180
(Case File of Liao's Fire
in Yong'an Village)

122
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,320
I was just reading it.

123
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:33,679
Shu He,

124
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,750
I've got something I want to tell you.

125
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:48,839
(Good Luck Restaurant)

126
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,240
Have a seat. Make yourself at home.

127
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,960
Have you always lived here?

128
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,840
I don't have an identity
and I can't stay in a hotel.

129
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,399
It's nice here.

130
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:06,399
Well,

131
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:08,200
did you say Tie Xin disappeared?

132
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,039
Yes.

133
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,760
We've checked all the CCTVs
at every intersection,

134
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,840
but he's disappeared

135
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:15,600
since the accident the other day.

136
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,600
He's really something.

137
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:19,559
In the beginning,

138
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:21,559
I spent the most time on him.

139
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,240
But now that he's wanted,

140
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,750
and he can't go anywhere,

141
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,290
so it shouldn't be too hard to find him.

142
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:29,799
You said before

143
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:32,600
that Dad sold the drugs
to Buhe City through him.

144
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:35,360
But the information I found
at the police station shows

145
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,440
that he doesn't have any
registered businesses or shops

146
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:40,799
under his name.

147
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,679
That means he's not a businessman

148
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,440
and has no sales channels.

149
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:48,360
I've looked into him before.

150
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,639
He was a mercenary in South Africa
before he came to Buhe City.

151
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,480
So he's probably a scavenger

152
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,759
working for someone else.

153
00:10:57,879 --> 00:10:59,840
If he started the fire at our house,

154
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,660
he's got to have someone else
behind him.

155
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,780
It's very possible.

156
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,080
But AH7

157
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,679
is not available in the market now.

158
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,559
They may have their own

159
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:09,159
unique sales strategy.

160
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,910
As long as they can make money,

161
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:13,159
it doesn't matter
if they're professional or not.

162
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,380
Find him as soon as possible.

163
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,799
Just ask him.

164
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,080
Not enough? You can have it all.

165
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,600
It's enough.

166
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,360
Just finish it.

167
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:23,480
You're here.

168
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,040
You didn't even tell us
Siyuan was coming.

169
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,640
We could buy some nice food for him.

170
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,879
Let me explain.

171
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,080
I didn't mean to act

172
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,559
in front of you when I met you earlier.

173
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:34,120
Your brother told me to do that.

174
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,320
It's his fault.

175
00:11:35,513 --> 00:11:36,314
I know.

176
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,639
I don't think you wanted me

177
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:41,320
to get involved in the first place.

178
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:43,480
It's a pity

179
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,860
you're not the obedient little kid

180
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,300
you were when you were little.

181
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:50,879
Buddies,

182
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:52,240
let me introduce him to you.

183
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,200
This is my younger brother, Liao Siyuan.

184
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:58,559
This is Gan.

185
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,720
This is Tai.

186
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,389
You've met Bai Han.

187
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:04,440
They're all my buddies
from the police academy.

188
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,760
I've forgotten how long it's been

189
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,000
since I've been introduced.

190
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,480
I seem to have forgotten my surname

191
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,200
after your sudden introduction.

192
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,400
Surname? Your surname is Zhang.

193
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,540
We have the same surname.

194
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,620
Why is my surname Zhang?

195
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,720
I'm your dad. Of course
you need to share my surname.

196
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:16,440
Get lost.

197
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:17,799
Get lost.

198
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:21,519
Siyuan,

199
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,679
we don't have the same accent,

200
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,600
but we're distant brothers.

201
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:27,720
His mother is the niece
of my second aunt's

202
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,399
sister's husband's sister.

203
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,840
All right.

204
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,519
Come on, let's get down to business.

205
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,100
It's Liu Haixun's mobile phone,

206
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,680
which we got from the explosion site.

207
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:44,279
After restoring it,

208
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:46,000
we found Tie Xin's number in it.

209
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:46,960
Then I had Tai

210
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,720
hack into the Communications Bureau's system

211
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,300
to check Tie Xin's contact history.

212
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,380
We found a few numbers

213
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,660
with high contact frequency.

214
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,120
We checked the owners' information.

215
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,039
It's all there.

216
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,879
Take a look.

217
00:12:57,025 --> 00:12:58,920
(Gai De)

218
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,159
Gai De?

219
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,600
Yes.

220
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:03,399
He's the founder and chairman

221
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:05,639
of an art training
organization called Zhenmei.

222
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,780
In the content
of Tie Xin's text messages with him,

223
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,420
he was repeatedly addressed as Boss.

224
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,600
And after Tie Xin was wanted,

225
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:14,120
Tie Xin contacted Gai De
at the first opportunity.

226
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,600
Maybe Gai De knows

227
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,870
where Tie Xin's hiding.

228
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:19,279
Just in time

229
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,240
for graduates like me,
who can't find a job,

230
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,799
to get a training course.

231
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:36,430
(Gai De)

232
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,480
Hurry up, we're late.

233
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,020
It's all your fault.

234
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,500
You went to the toilet eight times.

235
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:44,629
Lazy man's got a lot of poop.

236
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,940
Don't talk nonsense.
I only went to the toilet three times.

237
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,159
I'll blame you if I don't get in.

238
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,279
But this organization is really weird.

239
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:52,919
We have to rush to enroll.

240
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,920
It's not even this hard
to get into a university.

241
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,640
You're ignorant.

242
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:58,300
Zhenmei is the only professional
art training institution in Buhe

243
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,400
(Zhenmei International Art Training Hub)
that has cooperated

244
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,790
with several famous
art universities abroad.

245
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:03,500
(Zhenmei International Art Training Hub)

246
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,480
Full?

247
00:14:05,873 --> 00:14:07,153
This quarter is full.

248
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:07,879
I'm sorry.

249
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,559
Why don't you come back next quarter?

250
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,399
Can you guys accommodate us

251
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:12,399
with a few more spots?

252
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,519
We'd really like to come here and learn.

253
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,720
I'm sorry. I can't help it.

254
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,000
Miss, here is the thing.

255
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,960
They both majored in
Early Childhood Education at university.

256
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:23,440
Yes.

257
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,200
They're not here for themselves.

258
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,120
They just want to be involved better

259
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,790
in the children's education
in the future.

260
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,020
It's so meaningful.

261
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,399
If three spots aren't possible,

262
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,399
then two are fine.

263
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,519
Just now, I heard

264
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:41,919
some dropouts

265
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,399
from the pop group.

266
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,960
Maybe you could add them to the quota.

267
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,600
How about this?

268
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,360
Leave me your contact details.

269
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,200
If anyone does drop out,

270
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,080
I'll contact you.

271
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,360
Okay, thank you.

272
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,039
Thank you.

273
00:14:57,919 --> 00:14:58,519
Thank you.

274
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,480
Before I got here, I wondered

275
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,200
if it would be too much of a surprise,

276
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,919
if I did so well in class,

277
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,240
and if I stood out from the crowd,

278
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,000
that they'd just give me a detention.

279
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:23,559
Now it looks like

280
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,200
they're having a hard time hiring us

281
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,920
because of the tough economic situation

282
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,510
in Buhe City.

283
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,720
The teachers here are all

284
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,080
graduates of professional art schools.

285
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,440
Don't you know

286
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,920
that you need to be interviewed
for the art exam?

287
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:41,200
What do you mean?

288
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,720
What's wrong with the interview?
My image is good.

289
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:44,600
What do you mean?

290
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,100
You guys go ahead.
I'm going to the bathroom.

291
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,520
What? Did you eat something bad?

292
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,700
Why is it your turn?

293
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:54,559
Let's go.

294
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,720
I didn't steal anything from you.

295
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:49,120
I'm not a thief.

296
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:51,960
You didn't steal?

297
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,720
Did it grow legs

298
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,000
and get into your bag?

299
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,799
Call your mom and dad.

300
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:58,759
Otherwise, this won't end today.

301
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:02,240
I don't have a mom.

302
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:04,640
No wonder you steal.

303
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,960
So you're a child with no mother.

304
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,359
Call your dad now.

305
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:12,079
What's going on?

306
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,480
How can an adult talk this way?

307
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,960
How can a kid steal?

308
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,160
This one.

309
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,279
Luckily, I was sharp enough

310
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,599
to see her take it

311
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:24,200
before I got it out of her bag.

312
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,119
I'm being reasonable.

313
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:40,559
Your pens are on the top shelf.

314
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:43,039
How can she reach it
when she's so short?

315
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,240
She uses pencils for her exercise books,

316
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,599
not pens.

317
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,440
How did it get into her bag?

318
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:00,079
Forget it.

319
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,240
I won't argue with you anymore.

320
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:03,960
Leave now.

321
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:05,119
Do what you have to do.

322
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,359
Forget it?

323
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:08,200
You've wronged a child

324
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,040
and you're not going to apologize?

325
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:12,359
Apologize?

326
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:14,240
I almost lost something too.

327
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,799
It's hard to explain this kind of thing.

328
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:18,160
How about

329
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,480
calling the police?

330
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:24,640
Call... Call the police?

331
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,319
Why call the police?

332
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:28,359
Either call the police or apologize.

333
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,759
Little girl,

334
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:48,160
I shouldn't... I shouldn't
have accused you of anything.

335
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,559
I apologize.

336
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:50,440
I'm sorry.

337
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,319
Bill, please.

338
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,319
You said your name is Jiu, right?

339
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,839
My dad won't let me
eat candy from strangers.

340
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:11,440
I'm a stranger?

341
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:14,160
I've done you a big favor.

342
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,039
Thank you, Brother.

343
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:20,279
Go and play.

344
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,200
Thank you for just now.

345
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,200
It's nothing.

346
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,241
That pen...

347
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,760
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

348
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:46,519
Actually, I don't want others
to be wrongly accused either.

349
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:54,160
You...

350
00:19:57,559 --> 00:19:58,839
What's the matter

351
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,440
with you following me around?

352
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:22,359
Siyuan,

353
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:23,440
take a look.

354
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,559
Here's the floor plan of Gai De's house.

355
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,200
There are exits here and here.

356
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,119
I'll meet you out front.

357
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:31,160
Remember,

358
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:31,880
our purpose

359
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,440
is to find out where Tie Xin is.

360
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,559
If there's any danger, don't hesitate

361
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,640
to leave, okay?

362
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:41,359
Okay.

363
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:42,039
Wait.

364
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:45,759
Take it.

365
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,880
I don't think I need this.

366
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,279
It's hard to explain if I get caught.

367
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,720
Forget it.

368
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:56,359
All right.

369
00:20:58,319 --> 00:20:58,880
I'll be going.

370
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,400
Wait.

371
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:05,839
I think

372
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,160
it's better not to go in there.

373
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,079
I still think it's strange

374
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,880
that he asked you to his home
for the first time.

375
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,400
Why are you so maudlin?

376
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,599
I'll know when I get in.

377
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,359
Remember,

378
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:26,039
come out as soon
as you know where Tie Xin is.

379
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:28,279
Go.

380
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,920
You're more annoying than he is.

381
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,640
Who?

382
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,039
The one I imagined you to be.

383
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:38,039
He used to accompany me in these things.

384
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:39,400
But you're worse than him.

385
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,480
What's worse?

386
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:42,960
You're not invisible.

387
00:21:55,985 --> 00:22:04,130
(Gai De's House)

388
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:57,799
It's no fun playing alone.

389
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,510
- Have some drink.
- Play with me.

390
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:15,880
Come on.

391
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:43,520
It's said that a man's qualities can be
judged by his character after drinking.

392
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:45,319
Actually, it's not.

393
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:48,240
No matter how much a person drinks,

394
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,920
it only amplifies his inner desires.

395
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:54,839
No matter what he says or does,

396
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,519
it's all dictated

397
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,359
by what he intended to do.

398
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:01,599
Game isn't like that.

399
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:06,160
Game is subconscious.

400
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:08,480
It's too late to hide,

401
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:12,480
and it's the best way to see the heart.

402
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,000
What do you think?

403
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,680
Focus.

404
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,880
You're about to lose.

405
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,359
Can you

406
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:35,359
see ghosts too?

407
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:41,519
Actually,

408
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,680
so can I.

409
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:01,880
How do you know I can see ghosts?

410
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:10,640
Do you know

411
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,960
how insects communicate with each other?

412
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:16,160
Insects?

413
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,660
The sense of touch?

414
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:21,200
It's smell.

415
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,440
Almost all insects

416
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,680
secrete something

417
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:30,119
called insect pheromones

418
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,640
to signal seeking,

419
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,000
gathering, foraging,

420
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,480
mating, defense and so on.

421
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:40,960
But such an exchange of information

422
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:44,440
is only possible between the same kinds.

423
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,240
Actually,

424
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,119
it's not just insects.

425
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,880
Some people can find

426
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:56,599
their own kind by smell.

427
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,160
For example,

428
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,359
I saw you at Zhenmei.

429
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:17,400
How do you think

430
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,440
I knew you were following me

431
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,960
all of a sudden?

432
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:22,440
Even though I knew

433
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,920
you might be up to something else,

434
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:27,920
I still invited you home.

435
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,680
I... I'm not a person

436
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:32,799
who knows how to make friends.

437
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,400
I just haven't had anyone

438
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,039
to talk to in a long time.

439
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:49,920
I said I can see ghosts,

440
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,119
but what I see

441
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:57,640
is my twin brother.

442
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:12,240
In fact,

443
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,680
he left me ten years ago.

444
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,160
Everyone...

445
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:25,240
Everyone said he was an evil man,

446
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:29,039
but he was kind to me.

447
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:32,680
A lot of people look at me differently

448
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:36,519
since they know I can see him.

449
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:39,880
They think I...

450
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,759
They say the house is haunted.

451
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,720
Then,

452
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:54,039
my family found a bodyguard
named Tie Xin to protect me.

453
00:27:55,319 --> 00:27:56,440
It's called protection,

454
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,559
but it's actually spying on me.

455
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,319
He was always mysterious

456
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:05,640
and did things I didn't know about.

457
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,359
Then, my parents passed away,

458
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:10,400
and he disappeared,

459
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,000
leaving me alone.

460
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,559
But it's okay.

461
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,079
I know my brother is with me.

462
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,319
You...

463
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:37,359
What kind of person do you see?

464
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:45,280
If you don't want to talk about it,

465
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:46,839
it's okay.

466
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:48,279
Someone who means a lot to me.

467
00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:02,480
(Brother)
He's been my idol since I was a kid.

468
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:04,200
In my eyes,

469
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,720
he's smart,

470
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,839
brave, righteous,

471
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,279
and the best I've ever seen.

472
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:13,880
At that time I always thought

473
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:15,640
if only I could

474
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
be as good as him when I grew up.

475
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:21,079
Then I started to learn everything

476
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:23,279
from him.

477
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,400
He likes white.

478
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,640
My wardrobe

479
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:30,839
is full of white clothes.

480
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,720
He likes detective novels.

481
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:37,559
My bookcase is full of Agatha.

482
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:41,200
He doesn't like breakfast.

483
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,240
To learn from him,

484
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,750
I starved myself so much
that my stomach hurt.

485
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,000
My mom used to beat me up for that.

486
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:51,559
Then I realized

487
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,480
he just didn't eat at home.

488
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:56,920
He was 21 years old

489
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,880
when he left,

490
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,759
in the prime of his life,

491
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,160
young and vigorous.

492
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,920
After the fire,

493
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,559
he stayed at 21

494
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:15,559
and never grew up.

495
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:27,000
Some people

496
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:29,759
are strangers

497
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:32,120
even if they've known each other
for a long time.

498
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,640
But some people

499
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,380
feel like they've known each other
for ages

500
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:38,320
even though they haven't met
for a long time.

501
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,480
Don't think I'm exaggerating.

502
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,160
Knowing you

503
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,920
is the best thing that's happened to me

504
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:50,680
since my dad left.

505
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:00,039
So

506
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,039
we don't have

507
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,800
to beat around the bush with each other.

508
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:10,559
You can just tell me what's going on.

509
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:13,359
I will definitely help you.

510
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,680
Tie Xin started the fire

511
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:32,599
that killed my brother.

512
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:36,160
If you really want to help me,

513
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:39,319
tell me where he is.

514
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:44,279
Tie Xin?

515
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,359
Since he was wanted,

516
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:48,440
I haven't been able to find him.

517
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,600
I understand you have your difficulties.

518
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:54,640
But Tie Xin

519
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,160
is really important to me.

520
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:21,119
Siyuan.

521
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:23,960
Siyuan!

522
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:35,839
I'm sorry I broke one of your glasses.

523
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,480
I'll compensate you next time.

524
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,640
Bye.

525
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:24,420
Do you think he can tell you?

526
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:28,559
I'm not sure.

527
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:31,000
But this Gai De

528
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,160
is certainly different than I expected,

529
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:35,480
weirder than I expected,

530
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,559
and more sincere than I expected.

531
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:41,160
I'm not sure.

532
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:42,720
Let's wait and see.

533
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:52,279
I'm a bit curious.

534
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,279
Why did you tell him

535
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,160
about Liao Zhibai?

536
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:00,960
I was not telling him.

537
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,240
I was telling you.

538
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,719
From just now until now,

539
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,280
I've been thinking about one thing.

540
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,519
What's it?

541
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:22,960
My motivation

542
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,519
for living every day for the past
ten years has been vengeance.

543
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,679
That's why I did whatever it took

544
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,199
because I knew I had no tomorrow,

545
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,800
so I was not afraid.

546
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:38,079
I even thought

547
00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:41,880
that if I could kill Tie Xin

548
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,800
and find the truth,

549
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:46,519
I wouldn't mind dying with him.

550
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,719
But just now,

551
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:51,519
I heard you talking to Gai De

552
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:53,199
about the spirit of Liao Zhibai,

553
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,119
and I was swayed.

554
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,039
I'm not afraid of death,

555
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,280
but I don't want you to see me die.

556
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:11,119
I've thought about it.

557
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:14,960
Let's catch Tie Xin together

558
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:21,239
and put an end
to the 10 years of revenge.

559
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,360
Now that you're involved,

560
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,880
I promise

561
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:29,119
I won't do anything to him.

562
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:32,960
You can hand him over to the police,

563
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:36,960
and

564
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,400
I'll turn myself in.

565
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:50,719
I know what I'm saying
might be a little weird.

566
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,159
Actually,

567
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:58,599
I haven't killed anyone myself
in all these years.

568
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,320
I hope I won't be sentenced to death.

569
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,400
If I behave myself

570
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:08,199
in jail,

571
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:10,360
my sentence may be reduced.

572
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:15,519
Then I can get out early

573
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,800
and live with you again.

574
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:25,360
Siyuan,

575
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:28,960
because of you,

576
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:32,079
I want to turn back.

577
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,719
Even if I can't,

578
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:38,679
I don't want to go on like this.

579
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,079
Zhibai,

580
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:49,679
let's try it.

581
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,199
It's been a long time

582
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,440
since I've felt this excited
about tomorrow.

583
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:41,760
Buhe City Police Station.

584
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:43,360
Officer,

585
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,880
I want to report a crime.

586
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,880
Help me. Help.

587
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:52,000
Help...

588
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,680
The location of the call is located.

589
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:56,039
It's at 49 Defeng Road.

590
00:37:56,679 --> 00:37:58,280
Zhenmei International Art Train Hub.

591
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,280
The name of the caller is Ti Yi.

592
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:10,230
(Gai De)

593
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:14,920
Hello.

594
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,639
Siyuan,

595
00:38:17,639 --> 00:38:19,119
that Tie Xin you mentioned...

596
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:20,960
I do know where he is.

597
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:25,559
Can you help me find him?

598
00:38:27,559 --> 00:38:28,159
Yes.

599
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,840
When he was wanted,

600
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,880
I took pity on him

601
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,880
and found a place to keep him.

602
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,519
But if he ever did this to you,

603
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,639
(Gai De)
I'd better tell you.

604
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,150
Don't move! We're police.

605
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,800
What are you doing in my house?

606
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,480
Gai De, what's going on?

607
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,360
Liao Siyuan,

608
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,190
how come it's you again?

609
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:54,840
Please come in.

610
00:39:07,159 --> 00:39:07,880
Dr. Qi.

611
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,239
This is the person
who made the report, Ti Yi.

612
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:14,300
Hi, I'm a forensic pathologist
at Buhe City Police Station.

613
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,140
My name is Qi Xia.

614
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,230
I'm going to work with the doctor

615
00:39:17,239 --> 00:39:19,000
to examine you for physical trauma.

616
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:20,400
Don't be afraid.

617
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,080
Did you take a shower
after the incident?

618
00:39:58,888 --> 00:40:05,040
(Ti Yi)

619
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,760
I'm Ti Yi,

620
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:12,159
48 years old,

621
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:18,360
and I work as an administrator
at Zhenmei Art Hub.

622
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:20,400
I've been on the job

623
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,559
for over half a year.

624
00:40:27,519 --> 00:40:28,559
That night,

625
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,639
he came in at 10:30 PM.

626
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:34,159
I was working late.

627
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:43,880
I don't think

628
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,679
you'd believe me

629
00:40:48,519 --> 00:40:50,039
if I told you this.

630
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,599
I wouldn't believe it either.

631
00:40:57,039 --> 00:40:57,880
But I really,

632
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,400
really never thought...

633
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:03,519
Mr. Gai De

634
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:06,480
would do such a thing to me.

635
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,239
Mr. Gai De.

636
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,280
Things have been a little hectic lately.

637
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:36,900
Thank you for your hard work.

638
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,880
It's what I'm supposed to do.

639
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,519
You smell

640
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,679
familiar.

641
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,040
It's been a long time
since I've smelled it.

642
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:01,119
Can I smell you?

643
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,199
Mr. Gai De,

644
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,559
what are you trying to do?

645
00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:20,760
Let me smell you.
