Meihua.

00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,439
You are my queen.

4
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:02,960
Meihua.

5
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:04,920
A toast to you.

6
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,040
Drinking with you old folks

7
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,400
is no fun at all.

8
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,280
Then let's play

9
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,400
something fun.

10
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,760
Play?

11
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,239
We've had drinks.

12
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,959
We've sung songs.

13
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:34,840
I have a favor to ask of you.

14
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:36,120
Meihua.

15
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,319
There's no need to "ask".

16
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:38,560
Just say the word.

17
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:40,120
We're family, after all.

18
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:43,599
I heard

19
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:45,120
people saying

20
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,359
you've been giving my son
trouble lately.

21
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:52,079
That guy Song En

22
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,560
is one of your men, isn't he?

23
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:57,840
Who said that?

24
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:01,159
Meihua.

25
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,799
There's a misunderstanding.

26
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:08,039
I know that

27
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,199
you climbed from a humble security guard
to where you are now.

28
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,240
That wasn't easy.

29
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:25,869
I don't care who's backing you.

30
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:26,840
Please, listen to me...

31
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,030
I don't want to know either.

32
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,479
Whatever amount he's paying you,

33
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:37,439
I will add

34
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,639
another zero.

35
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:44,599
Alright?

36
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,360
Meihua...

37
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,360
Not enough?

38
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,039
Another zero.

39
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,039
How about now?

40
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:51,879
Listen to me.

41
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:53,319
Still not enough?

42
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:54,800
So petty.

43
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,280
One more zero.

44
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:59,039
Now that should do it.

45
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,360
Still not enough?

46
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,400
You're a greedy one.

47
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,800
Alright, alright.

48
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:24,199
I'll give in to you.

49
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:29,120
After all, I'm a mother.

50
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:45,400
But if you still keep

51
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,319
giving my son trouble,

52
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:56,599
I won't hesitate

53
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:00,240
to kill you.

54
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,039
Do you really take me
for some pharmacist?

55
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,560
Enjoy yourself.

56
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:20,040
I have another appointment.

57
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,519
I hope I didn't ruin your fun.

Don't move!

Don't use force!

63
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,399
Step back!

00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:29,959
Get lost!

65
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:30,309
Kill him!

66
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,790
- Don't use force.
- I'm warning you.

67
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,510
Today, I'm going to smash this thing.

68
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,510
What right do you have?

69
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,680
What right do you have?

70
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,279
Step back.

71
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:37,199
Step back!

72
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,319
Look at the bloodstains

73
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,519
on the altar.

74
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:43,839
A murder definitely happened here.

75
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,160
This is the primary crime scene.

76
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,319
What happened?

77
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,120
Jie En had a big client.

78
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,600
He came to pick up dried fruit.

79
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,160
This morning, he was found lying here

80
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:58,000
covered by a tattered fishing net.

81
00:06:58,399 --> 00:06:59,839
One of his hands was cut off

82
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,360
and placed right on that altar.

83
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,839
You're the police, huh?

84
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:04,560
Step back.

85
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,260
You care so much about ghosts
and spirits,

86
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,040
but don't care about chopped-off hands?

87
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:08,959
Step back.

88
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,240
What are you looking at?

89
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:12,199
I'm telling you,

90
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,680
I'm smashing it today.

91
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,440
Are you crazy? What gives you the right?

92
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,000
Calm down...

93
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:18,000
What gives me the right?

94
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,380
Because your so-called spirit
is just nonsense!

95
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,680
- Get out of my way!
- Stop.

96
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,040
You mustn't touch it!

97
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,839
You're all scared, huh?

98
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:35,199
Well, I'm not.

99
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,560
Where are you going?

100
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:51,920
Move aside.

101
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,600
Folks,

102
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,200
the so-called River Spirit's curse
is just superstition.

103
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,079
Don't spread baseless rumors.

104
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:02,120
We, the police, will find the victim

105
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,340
and investigate thoroughly.

106
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,800
As for this River Spirit statue,

107
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,360
it is public property.

108
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,600
No one has the right to destroy it.

109
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:09,959
Now, disperse.

110
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:10,720
Go home.

111
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,519
Disperse.

112
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,519
Everyone, go home.

113
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:13,160
Go on, disperse.

114
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,319
Back to farming.

115
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:15,560
Go home.

116
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,279
Everyone, disperse.

117
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:18,319
Go back.

118
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,279
Back to your fields.

119
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:20,480
Alright, move along.

120
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:22,680
Go home.

121
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,160
I haven't seen you before.

122
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,940
You're not from Yong'an Village...

123
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,120
I can speak Chinese.

124
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,800
You look unfamiliar.

125
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,480
You're not from Yong'an Village,
are you?

126
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,200
I am.

127
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,420
My father used to be the chief
of Yong'an Village.

128
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,620
His name was Liao Nianguo.

129
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,440
Liao Nianguo?

130
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,580
You're the youngest son
of the Liao family?

131
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:42,759
I've heard of you.

132
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,320
When did you come back?

133
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:45,559
Yesterday.

134
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:47,559
The same day as the victim.

135
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:49,759
Yes.

136
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,720
Regarding last night's incident,

137
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,020
we may need to ask a few of you

138
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,980
some questions.

139
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,840
Please don't leave yet.

140
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,500
Thank you for your cooperation.

141
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,720
Do you know what I saw today?

142
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,799
That so-called River Spirit
is total nonsense.

143
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,200
Now I know everything.

144
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,080
Listen...

145
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:16,879
If you

146
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,679
can please me

147
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,320
tonight,

148
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,840
then I won't say a word.

149
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,120
Thank you.

150
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:01,840
Siyuan, hurry up.

151
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,639
Alright.

152
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,519
(Water Lantern Festival)
So many people!

153
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:09,360
(Water Lantern Festival)
Why is there such a big crowd?

154
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,559
Is it always this crowded every year?

155
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:16,120
Water Lantern Festival is organized
by the town every year.

156
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,350
Probably to prevent fires,

157
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,720
they only release lanterns
in certain sections of the river,

158
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,120
and you have to register with your
real name before entering.

159
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:23,960
Then we had better hurry.

160
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,559
We need to get a good spot.

161
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:32,120
Can you sign us in together?

162
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,440
How much is this?

163
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:46,759
Eighty puna.

164
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,600
Alright.

165
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:55,919
Thank you.

166
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:56,840
Liao Siyuan.

167
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,380
Do you think this lantern looks nice?

168
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,360
This one?

169
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,159
It's alright.

170
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,320
What about this one?

171
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:02,679
How about this?

172
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,600
They're about the same.

173
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:06,600
You're no fun.

174
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:07,460
Then you pick one.

175
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:08,360
You choose.

176
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,550
Does this one look nice?

177
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,640
Of course.
Everything you choose looks great.

178
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,000
You're just brushing me off.

179
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:13,960
No, I'm not.

180
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:16,360
This one.

181
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,480
And this one.

182
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,679
Do you have that many wishes?

183
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,320
Well,

184
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,519
I'm going to wish
for my mom's good health,

185
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,200
and to pass my exams,

186
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:29,519
and...

187
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,200
to become prettier.

188
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:33,919
Okay.

189
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:34,679
And...

190
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:36,720
So, not a single wish
has anything to do with me?

191
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,519
That's fine.

192
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,200
How much?

193
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,200
Ninety puna.

194
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,639
I'll buy all your wishes.

195
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:44,679
Here you go.

196
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:45,600
I want this one too.

197
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:46,279
Alright.

198
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,399
Xia.

199
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:55,320
Xia.

200
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,200
We bought two.

201
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,679
Aren't they exactly the same?

202
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:00,519
Where's Su Pa?

203
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,480
Aren't we supposed to make a wish first?

204
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,000
You released it just like that.

205
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,120
I need to make a wish.

206
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:10,120
What did you wish for?

207
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,639
What about you?

208
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,759
Of course, I wished

209
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:16,159
to be with Liao Siyuan forever.

210
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:18,440
The farther my lantern floats,
the better.

211
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,080
Aren't we only allowed
to release them here?

212
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,840
I want to set mine upstream.

213
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:37,440
Look, a raft is floating towards us!

214
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,679
Is that a body?

215
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,360
It kind of looks like Jie En.

216
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:55,240
It's a dead body!

217
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,440
There's a dead body! A dead body!

218
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:01,519
It's a dead body...

219
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,559
A dead body!

220
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,240
A dead body!

221
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,559
It's a sign from the River Spirit!

222
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:12,759
The River Spirit has manifested...

223
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,679
The River Spirit has manifested...

224
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:18,240
The River Spirit has manifested...

225
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,510
Right in front of everyone's eyes,

226
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:47,840
illuminated by lanterns,

227
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,799
the corpse drifted downstream.

228
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:51,759
Imagine pinning the murder

229
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,039
on the River Spirit.

230
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:54,200
Siyuan,

231
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:55,269
this murderer

232
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:57,280
must be an avid fan
of classic detective novels.

233
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,840
The killer staged everything
meticulously.

234
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,919
Looks like he's quite confident.

235
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:05,480
Alright.

236
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:06,960
Got it.

237
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:11,879
Hold this.

238
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:12,600
Okay.

239
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,679
You can't go in.

240
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,740
I'm Qi Xia, a forensic doctor
from Buhe Police Station.

241
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,320
The station has suspended my leave
and asked me to assist on-site.

242
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,790
Dr. Qi, you were also the one
who discovered the body, right?

243
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:26,279
Yes.

244
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:26,960
It was me.

245
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,840
I was the first to discover the body.

246
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,120
He's my brother.

247
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,159
How did you get in here?

248
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,980
I had contact with the deceased
before he died.

249
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:37,679
I also witnessed the moment
his body appeared.

250
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,960
Most importantly,

251
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,480
Buhe City Police Station
has given me

252
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,140
special permission to assist
in the case.

253
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:43,600
That's true.

254
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,320
I'll call to confirm.

255
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,360
Don't touch anything
and disrupt the scene.

256
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,220
The body floated downstream
on a bamboo raft,

257
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,260
head pointing north, feet south,
lying face up.

258
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,000
Both hands were positioned at his sides.

259
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:05,759
Two centimeters below the Adam's apple,

260
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,359
there's a roughly nine-millimeter
circular wound.

261
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:09,799
The face appears to be smiling.

262
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:21,200
The River Spirit wouldn't need
to go to such trouble to kill.

263
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:23,680
Siyuan, come over here.

264
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,359
Look at this candle.

265
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,680
Elementary school math problem.

266
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,440
You do it.

267
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,240
The nearby hydrology station

268
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:44,559
has recorded today's water flow speed.

269
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:47,799
2.3 meters per second.

270
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,880
Based on the candle's weight,

271
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:54,640
its burn rate,

272
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,240
and its burned state,

273
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,440
it burned for about an hour.

274
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,160
Time multiplies by speed...

275
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:07,839
That means

276
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:09,640
the body was dumped

277
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,880
8.3 kilometers upstream.

278
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,400
8.3 kilometers by river...

279
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,599
By land...

280
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,880
16 kilometers.

281
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,559
By 9 PM, everyone had arrived
at the festival.

282
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,279
By 9:20 PM, the body floated
in front of us.

283
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,160
The world record
for a 10-kilometer marathon

284
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,720
is only 26 minutes and 20 seconds.

285
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,079
Who could have run 16 kilometers

286
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:37,200
on mountain roads in under 40 minutes

287
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,260
and made it back here?

288
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:40,839
Siyuan,

289
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:42,680
it's getting late.

290
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,220
Take Li Zhi and the others home.

291
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:46,799
Sure.

292
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,319
The River Spirit has manifested.

293
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,799
The River Spirit has manifested.

294
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,880
The River Spirit has manifested.

295
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:05,599
The River Spirit has manifested.

296
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:08,119
It's all my fault.

297
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:09,480
I shouldn't have told Mom so much.

298
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,039
She got scared.

299
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,680
Mr. Na Wa,

300
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,400
I heard the villagers say that Ke Xin

301
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,540
is the River Spirit's wife.

302
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,270
Why?

303
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:23,720
Our village has a tradition.

304
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,680
Whenever a girl decides
who she will marry,

305
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,079
she wears a red wedding dress

306
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,600
and goes to meet the one she loves.

307
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,550
On the day the River Spirit's statue
was renovated,

308
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,440
someone saw Ke Xin
in a red wedding dress,

309
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:40,039
wandering the streets in a daze.

310
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,559
When they found her again,

311
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,720
she was placed
before the River Spirit's statue

312
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,160
like an offering.

313
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,640
From that day on,

314
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:55,660
rumors spread that the River Spirit
had taken a liking to Ke Xin.

315
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,759
It seems like ever since that day,

316
00:19:58,839 --> 00:19:59,839
Ke Xin went insane.

317
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:01,480
That's also why

318
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:03,880
no one in the village
dares to bully her.

319
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,480
What about Ba Song?

320
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:07,720
He must have done

321
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,799
something unspeakable.

322
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:10,039
The River Spirit

323
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:11,759
never punishes the innocent.

324
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,720
Looks like we can't leave for now.

325
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:23,839
Yeah.

326
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,079
Because of Jie En's

327
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:29,400
death smile...

328
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Known clues:

329
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,079
The body floated

330
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,319
alongside the river lanterns
for 40 minutes.

331
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,119
So what does this 40-minute
time frame mean?

332
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:01,799
Assuming the killer
placed the body on the raft,

333
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,559
then immediately ran downstream,

334
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:08,599
it's still impossible for him

335
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:12,319
to cover 16 kilometers of mountain roads

336
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,960
and reach the festival in 40 minutes.

337
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,960
Entry to the festival
required registration.

338
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,519
It means

339
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,090
the killer wasn't among the people
releasing lanterns downstream.

340
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:26,759
Are you sure everyone was accounted for?

341
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:27,880
No...

342
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,640
Who's missing?

343
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:32,000
No one is missing.

344
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,580
In fact, it seems like there was
one extra person.

345
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,760
The extra person
isn't necessarily the killer, right?

346
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:39,359
Instead of lying in bed
racking our brains,

347
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,640
we can go back to the scene

348
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,260
and see if the killer made any mistakes.

349
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,160
Didn't we just come back from the scene?

350
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:45,960
There's another crime scene.

351
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:32,920
Who could it be this early?

352
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,960
Is it the killer?

353
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,519
Worse than the killer.

354
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,519
Dr. Qi.

355
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,480
What are you doing here?

356
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,759
Taking a vacation,

357
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,680
and investigating a case on the side.

358
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:42,029
Tell him not to run around,

359
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,400
and there won't be any cases.

360
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:47,269
Dr. Qi finally gets a vacation,

361
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,540
but still has to work overtime.

362
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,960
I really feel bad about it.

363
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,240
I've checked the area.

364
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:56,279
No footprints or other traces.

365
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,240
The killer was very careful.

366
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,940
It's easy to avoid leaving footprints
on a wet riverbed.

367
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,440
Just lay down stones or wooden planks,

368
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,820
walk backward when retreating,

369
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,240
and remove the stones and planks

370
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,320
one by one after crossing.

371
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,079
That's it.

372
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:11,400
I remember when we first arrived
at the village,

373
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:12,799
the riverbed was pretty dry.

374
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:15,079
Now the water level is so high.

375
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,270
Yesterday was the festival.

376
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,800
They opened the floodgates upstream,

377
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,240
so the water level rose quickly.

378
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,200
Xia.

379
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:29,380
The victim died from a penetrating wound
to the neck.

380
00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:30,839
Judging by his facial expression,

381
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,839
he likely took AH7 before he died.

382
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,759
But if he took

383
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:36,079
a lethal dose of AH7,

384
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,960
why would the killer need to stab him?

385
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:39,519
AH7 is an uncommon substance.

386
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:41,200
We barely know anything about it.

387
00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:43,240
Even its lethal dosage

388
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:44,880
is not precisely determined yet.

389
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:47,079
We need to test the blood

390
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,759
to determine the drug concentration.

391
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:51,519
Looking at Jie En's fingers

392
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:53,519
and the cyanosis of his tongue,

393
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:56,000
AH7 wasn't the cause of death.

394
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,759
This is different
from the previous two cases.

395
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,580
What about the weapon that caused
the penetrating wound?

396
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,200
Can you determine what it was?

397
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,320
The weapon was likely

398
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,420
a cylindrical rod
about six millimeters in diameter.

399
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:11,000
Its tip was triangular and sharp.

400
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,740
This is a penetrating wound.

401
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,220
The weapon must have been long enough.

402
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,920
Excluding the part the killer held,

403
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,160
it had to be at least
ten centimeters long.

404
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,400
The wound is very clean.

405
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,359
A single fatal strike.

406
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,590
It would be difficult to inflict
such a wound by hand.

407
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:25,920
The killer likely used
some kind of mechanical device.

408
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,400
A mechanical device?

409
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,799
For example,

410
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,599
a crossbow.

411
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,359
This won't do either.

412
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:44,519
How could you hurt an animal?

413
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:52,319
What are you doing?

414
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:55,359
Stay back.

415
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,200
What do you think I'm doing?

416
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,359
Are you scared?

417
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:03,960
Terrified?

418
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,240
The safety lock is on.

419
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:08,440
Are you stupid?

420
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,559
You're safe with me.

421
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:35,240
I remember that Tai Shu used
to hunt with a crossbow.

422
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,079
Could it be that he's back?

423
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,680
He's been gone for years.

424
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,500
How come he showed up
right after we arrived?

425
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,599
Siyuan, you and Li Zhi must be careful.

426
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:43,720
Don't act recklessly.

427
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,759
Got it.

428
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:47,680
I remember

429
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,880
it was simply left here.

430
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,160
Why can't I find it now?

431
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:51,799
Siyuan,

432
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,029
don't just stand here.

433
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:53,820
You'll catch a cold.

434
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:54,680
Keep looking.

435
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:56,519
This is so strange.

436
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:09,880
Why are you here?

437
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,839
Don't you have a case?

438
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:14,759
The Director sent me over right away.

439
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:15,920
I arrived early this morning.

440
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,880
Have them check
Jie En's missing bank card.

441
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,500
He already coordinated with me.

442
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:21,680
Did you find anything?

443
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:24,559
On the night of the crime,

444
00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:26,440
someone used Jie En's bank card.

445
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:28,640
They withdrew money from an ATM

446
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,640
in a town less than five kilometers
from here.

447
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,039
We've just received

448
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:33,279
the surveillance footage.

449
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,279
This person.

450
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:38,110
Is there any other surveillance nearby?

451
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,279
That tiny town?

452
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,480
Probably not.

453
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,940
Release the footage publicly.

454
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,260
Let the villagers take a look.

455
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:47,070
This person's heavy covering
draws more attention.

456
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:47,799
Agreed.

457
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:52,000
What's wrong, Mo?

458
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,519
I feel like this person looks familiar.

459
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:55,599
Chief, look.

460
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:57,480
The way he walks...

461
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,759
Hunched shoulders,

462
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:01,119
bowed legs, slight outward gait...

463
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:03,279
I remember now.

464
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:03,880
It's Tai Shu.

465
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,349
That guy was a thug

466
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,460
who always caused trouble.

467
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:07,720
I grew up here.

468
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,820
As a kid, I was terrified
of running into him.

469
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,480
But I heard he fled years ago

470
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,559
to escape debt.

471
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,079
No idea when he came back.

472
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,700
Issue an all-out search for Tai Shu.

473
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,559
Check the stations, motels, restaurants,

474
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,559
everywhere.

475
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,660
Inform the nearby villages as well.

476
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:24,400
Got it.

477
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,480
(Dried Fruit Factory)

478
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,080
(Dried Fruit Factory)
The search for Tai Shu will take time.

479
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,039
Let's keep investigating Jie En.

480
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,920
First, let's check

481
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:55,759
who he's been in contact with lately.

482
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,110
Excuse me, can I help you?

483
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,790
This is Jie En's factory, right?

484
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,180
We're here to gather information.

485
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:02,000
Yes.

486
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,820
Anyone from Buhe come by recently?

487
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:06,960
Oh...

488
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,119
Maybe a worker drove their kid's car.

489
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,269
Young people

490
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:11,360
don't stick around here.

491
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,980
Most of them go to work in Buhe.

492
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:14,680
Come inside.

493
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,559
This is unacceptable.

494
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,039
How long has it been already?

495
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:31,519
Yeah!

496
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:33,880
We need an explanation.

497
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,519
Officer,

498
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,760
when will the police blockade

499
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,400
around the River Spirit statue be lifted?

500
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,599
Exactly, it's making everyone anxious.

501
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,160
We need to hold a ritual

502
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,560
to appease the River Spirit's wrath.

503
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,340
That's right.

504
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:45,119
We have to do it.

505
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:46,200
What's going on here?

506
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,440
Everyone, calm down.

507
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,480
There's no need to panic.

508
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,640
Please realize

509
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:54,559
that there are no such things
as ghosts or spirits.

510
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:55,279
Alright?

511
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:56,599
Even you don't sound convinced,

512
00:30:56,599 --> 00:30:57,880
and you expect us to believe you?

513
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,720
Be careful, or you'll get
what's coming to you.

514
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,559
Jie En is dead. How could
there be no ghosts or spirits?

515
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:04,160
Exactly.

516
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,680
The River Spirit did it, am I right?

517
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,000
Yes, it was the River Spirit.

518
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,240
Why is there all this noise?

519
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,240
What's the commotion all about?

520
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,480
Regarding Jie En's death,

521
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:15,120
the police have already investigated it.

522
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,880
It wasn't the River Spirit at all.

523
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,519
- Then who did it?
- Who was it?

524
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,640
It was someone from your village,

525
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:22,240
a man named Tai Shu.

526
00:31:24,039 --> 00:31:25,200
You all know him, right?

527
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:26,839
The police are now

528
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,119
conducting a full-scale search for him.

529
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:30,759
Anyone in the village

530
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,359
who knows where Tai Shu is

531
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,060
must report to the police immediately.

532
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,319
Do you understand?

533
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:40,020
Are you all mute?
I asked you a question.

534
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:40,880
Do you understand?

535
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,880
Understood? Now disperse.

536
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,240
Go on, disperse.

537
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:54,559
Tai Shu was the "River Spirit"?

538
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:55,920
But Tai Shu left, didn't he?

539
00:31:56,279 --> 00:31:57,200
Yeah...

540
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:03,000
But what about the rumors
of the River Spirit's wife?

541
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,559
It was probably that guy, right?

542
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,720
It must have been Tai Shu
who spread the rumors.

543
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,759
So he was just playing us all along?

544
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,640
Maybe Ke Xin was faking it too!

545
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:14,400
Of course she was.

546
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,220
Those two are nothing
but a pair of schemers.

547
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,350
Then what are we waiting for?

548
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:18,400
Let's go find them!

549
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,680
- Let's go.
- Those scoundrels!

550
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:21,240
Let's go!

551
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:22,559
Find those two schemers.

552
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,200
Schemers!

553
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:24,720
Let's go!

554
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,640
Let's see what they have to say.

555
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:30,799
This way, please.

556
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,759
This is our dried fruit production line.

557
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,319
We recently received a big order,

558
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:40,599
so everyone's really busy.

559
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,599
This is good stuff.

560
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:00,279
We only produce

561
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:01,960
the highest-end gift boxes.

562
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,319
Good fruit selection

563
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:04,839
makes delicious

564
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:05,759
dried fruit and chips.

565
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,559
Rest assured,

566
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,559
we don't use
any artificial flavoring here.

567
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:19,400
What's this?

568
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,180
A storage container for mangoes.

569
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,880
When was the last time you saw Jie En?

570
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:34,180
It was in the afternoon on the day
of Water Lantern Festival.

571
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,280
Normally, we'd have the day off
for the festival.

572
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,350
But as you can see,

573
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,440
the factory's been busy.

574
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,720
Everyone had to work overtime.

575
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:40,780
No one could take leave.

576
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,559
Did Jie En stay and work overtime too?

577
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,960
He was the boss.

578
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:46,359
He didn't need to work.

579
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:47,400
We worked overtime.

580
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,160
He spent the whole afternoon drinking.

581
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,440
Did he drink often?

582
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:52,680
Not really.

583
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:55,440
Only when entertaining clients
he'd have a couple of drinks.

584
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,240
But that day,

585
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,160
he was acting strange.

586
00:33:58,359 --> 00:33:58,960
That day,

587
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,440
he seemed exceptionally happy.

588
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:03,480
He drank from noon into the night.

589
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,520
Why did you drink so much?

590
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:10,320
Do you know Ke Xin?

591
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:11,800
Yes.

592
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:13,400
Mine.

593
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,400
Yours?

594
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:17,079
Ke Xin is mine!

595
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,719
Are you okay?

596
00:35:16,039 --> 00:35:16,559
Speak.

597
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:20,199
Got it.

598
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:22,239
Liao Siyuan, let's go.

599
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,519
Right now?

600
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,360
I'll walk you out.

601
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,320
No need, thank you.

602
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:28,840
What's wrong?

603
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,070
Trouble at Ke Xin's house.

604
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:49,280
Come on.

605
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,760
Tricksters!

606
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,480
What the hell is all this?

607
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,920
What is this?

608
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,480
If she were really insane,

609
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,360
why did she dodge the brick?

610
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:16,239
Exactly.

611
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,480
If she were really crazy,

612
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,230
why would she only comb her hair here

613
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:21,400
instead of anywhere else?

614
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,000
She's pretending.

615
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:26,599
Pretending to be insane to seduce men!

616
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:28,320
Pretending to be insane to seduce men!

617
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:30,199
Let me check

618
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,119
if she's really crazy.

619
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:41,960
Blood...

620
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,639
She bit him.

621
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:47,199
She's definitely faking it.

622
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:49,039
She's pretending.

623
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:50,360
She's definitely pretending.

624
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:51,800
What are you waiting for?

625
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:52,760
Tie her up!

626
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,440
Come on!

627
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,519
Tie her up!

628
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,639
You like seducing men, huh?

629
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,679
The gas station.

630
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,920
Trouble at the gas station!

631
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,920
Trouble at the gas station!

632
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:26,039
Trouble at the gas station!

633
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:29,159
Seducer!

634
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,800
Seducer!

635
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,719
Beat her to death!

636
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,400
Don't come any closer!

637
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:11,159
Step back!

638
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:12,630
One more step and I won't be polite!

639
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:14,800
The police is hitting people!

640
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,480
What are you doing?

641
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:16,960
Step back.

642
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,199
I'm warning you, don't push me.

643
00:38:18,519 --> 00:38:19,280
I'm telling you,

644
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,800
Ke Xin and Su Pa

645
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,280
must give us an explanation today!

646
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,599
That's right, an explanation!

647
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:25,159
- Explain...
- What explanation?

648
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:25,800
Step back!

649
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,000
All these years,
they've been playing tricks,

650
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,679
scaring us.

651
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,510
They're in cahoots with Tai Shu,
aren't they?

652
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:33,629
- Yes, they're in cahoots...
- Yes, they're in cahoots...

653
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:35,160
Are you all crazy?

654
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,860
If you have so much energy, help
the police catch the real criminals.

655
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,390
Assaulting women, what does that prove?

656
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:41,230
Who's assaulting women?

657
00:38:41,239 --> 00:38:42,079
Watch your mouth.

658
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:44,360
You little girl, where are your manners?

659
00:38:44,519 --> 00:38:46,440
If you keep hanging around
with this woman,

660
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:47,640
you'll end up just like her.

661
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,940
Talking to me about manners?
Fine, I won't argue with you.

662
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,920
But I recorded everything you just did.

663
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,159
I have plenty of money.

664
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:54,440
I'll hire the best lawyers.

665
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:56,239
Just for intentional assault alone,

666
00:38:56,239 --> 00:38:57,679
you're looking at jail time.

667
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:04,320
What are you doing?

668
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,119
Let go! Back off!

669
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,280
You say she's the murderer?

670
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:16,159
Do you have any proof?

671
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,800
She is the killer.

672
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:21,229
You just randomly accuse people,

673
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,560
throwing baseless charges.

674
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:23,519
Do you even realize

675
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,159
that spreading false rumors is a crime?

676
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,030
Who's spreading rumors?

677
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:30,110
We weren't spreading rumors.

678
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,400
We didn't wrong her.

679
00:39:31,719 --> 00:39:33,039
As long as she stays here,

680
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:34,280
there will be no peace.

681
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,119
We're doing this for everyone's safety.

682
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:37,960
- We're doing this for everyone.
- We're doing this for everyone.

683
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,079
Look into your own hearts.

684
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,800
What exactly were you just doing?

685
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:44,280
Were you really punishing a murderer?

686
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:45,840
Or just taking advantage

687
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,280
of a woman in the midst of chaos?

688
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:56,590
Did you touch her or not?

689
00:39:58,079 --> 00:39:59,000
Did you touch her?

690
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:00,159
I didn't.

691
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,440
I didn't touch her.

692
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:02,960
Smash the River Spirit statue!

693
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:05,880
Smash it...

694
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:09,920
Smash it! Avenge Jie En!

695
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,320
It killed my son.

696
00:40:30,519 --> 00:40:31,960
I have to destroy it today!

697
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,679
Please calm down.

698
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,280
The police are already investigating.

699
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I'm telling you,

700
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,840
no matter what you say,
it won't work today.

701
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,840
First, we tear down
the River Spirit statue.

702
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,720
Then, we deal with that
crazy woman Ke Xin.

703
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,800
My brother was a good man,

704
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:45,760
but that madwoman Ke Xin got him killed.

705
00:40:46,039 --> 00:40:48,320
Why is this cursed statue
protecting her?

706
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,519
The police are already investigating.
Step back.

707
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,510
- Smash it.
- Step back.

708
00:40:51,639 --> 00:40:52,199
Smash it.

709
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,840
It killed my son.

710
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,480
Step back.

711
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:55,199
It killed my son.

712
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:55,960
Stop him.

713
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:56,679
Smash it!

714
00:40:56,679 --> 00:40:58,400
Calm down...

715
00:40:58,639 --> 00:40:59,760
It killed my son.

716
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:00,840
Smash it!

717
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,079
Smash it!

718
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:02,880
Smash it!

719
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,039
Smash it!

720
00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:05,880
Smash it!

721
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,079
Smash it!

722
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,119
It killed my son!

723
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,400
Smash it...

724
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:19,280
Smash it...

725
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,760
Smash it.

726
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,400
Smash it...

727
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,480
Smash it...

728
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,320
Smash it!
