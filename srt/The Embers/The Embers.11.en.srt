1
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,640
You can really endure it.

2
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,240
17 minutes

3
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:40,200
and 32 seconds.

4
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:44,520
You broke our record here.

5
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,679
You're really stubborn.

6
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,520
I told you many times.

7
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:57,640
I don't know
what that person looks like.

8
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,000
I heard

9
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:10,519
Xu Man has been waiting for you
in Buhe City.

10
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:13,300
I heard that the security there
isn't very good recently.

11
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:14,959
If she was kidnapped,

12
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,000
would she be as stubborn as you?

13
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,760
You

14
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:23,159
can't touch her.

15
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:34,400
Look.

16
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,239
Ms. Xu Man, what would you
like to eat for lunch?

17
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:40,439
I have no appetite.

18
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,079
Get me a glass of juice.

19
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:42,920
Sure.

20
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:53,280
Tell me.

21
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,799
What should I add to her juice?

22
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:02,400
How about the AH7
you're familiar with?

23
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,239
Don't touch her!

24
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,680
Don't touch her!
You're not allowed to touch her!

25
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,580
You're not allowed...

26
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,439
Tell me

27
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:15,639
who that person is.

28
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:24,199
I'll tell you.

29
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:34,840
I'll tell you.

30
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,159
I'll tell you.

31
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:37,599
I really didn't see

32
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,039
what that person looked like.

33
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:41,800
I just know that he isn't tall.

34
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,919
His brow bone
is higher than normal people's.

35
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,759
He looks relatively thin.

36
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,199
And...

37
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,759
And he has deep-set eyes.

38
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,199
I really don't know anything else.

39
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,719
I really don't know.

40
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:53,759
I told you everything I know.

41
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:55,639
Don't touch her.

42
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:58,319
Don't touch her.

43
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,960
Xun, I'm done.

44
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,680
It's him.

45
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:42,714
=The Embers=

46
00:04:44,109 --> 00:04:46,790
=Episode 11=

47
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,060
Still thinking about what Pei Ji said?

48
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:08,680
He left nothing behind
in the first case.

49
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,600
In the second case,

50
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:15,319
the photo Nu Na left behind

51
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,560
was taken by him.

52
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,000
It's obvious

53
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,920
he wants to cover up the truth

54
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,800
or

55
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,060
prevent us
from continuing the investigation.

56
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:37,600
Siyuan.

57
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:40,240
I think

58
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,800
we shouldn't investigate further.

59
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:47,079
You said this many times.

60
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:53,800
I don't think you realize

61
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,160
how much danger you're in.

62
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,600
If Lai La's case

63
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:00,439
just happened to be related to drugs,

64
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:01,639
this time

65
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,399
it's obvious that it's related to drugs.

66
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,680
The things I taught you,

67
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,680
deductive reasoning,

68
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:07,879
and criminal profiling

69
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:09,879
are useless when facing

70
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:10,879
those criminals.

71
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,360
And I'm afraid you'll die

72
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:16,120
if you continue investigating.

73
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,160
But I keep feeling

74
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,900
that this person
is more like a friend than an enemy.

75
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:25,560
With his scheming,

76
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,000
I would have died a long time ago

77
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,839
if he wanted to deal with me.

78
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,120
But I haven't suffered

79
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,189
any real harm so far...

80
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,100
The human heart
isn't as simple as you think.

81
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,360
Think about it.

82
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,240
Why did he use AH7 to kill people?

83
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,800
Murder should obviously
be carried out in the most discreet way.

84
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:41,880
There are so many ways,

85
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,430
but he chose

86
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:43,959
the most conspicuous drug to kill.

87
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,879
Besides,

88
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,600
the victims of the first two cases,

89
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,360
Nu Na

90
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:50,439
and Song En,

91
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:52,040
have one thing in common.

92
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,360
They were

93
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,439
all witnesses to the fire ten years ago.

94
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,839
Is it possible

95
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:00,240
that they saw

96
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:01,920
some unspeakable secret at the scene

97
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:03,600
and were silenced?

98
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,279
And you...

99
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,680
You witnessed the fire too.

100
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,040
Even though you don't remember anything,

101
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:12,079
who can guarantee

102
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,920
that you won't become his next target?

103
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,400
Let's think about this
from another angle.

104
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,519
He might be helping us

105
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:26,639
by bringing AH7 back into the world

106
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,190
and reopening the old fire case.

107
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:32,920
As for Nu Na and Song En,

108
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,079
we don't know

109
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,480
whether

110
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,519
they were participants or witnesses yet.

111
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,160
Even so,

112
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:45,620
are you going to persuade me to give up?

113
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,800
Our home is gone.

114
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:49,720
I'm already dead.

115
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,509
The truth isn't as important
as you staying safe and alive.

116
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,900
But I don't want to live like this.

117
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,519
I never told you, right?

118
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:05,600
I often have a dream

119
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,519
that I died in a fire with you

120
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:12,240
when I was ten years old.

121
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,920
When I wake up,

122
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:19,240
I'm still alive.

123
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,360
Only I am alive.

124
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:31,639
Since the fire didn't take me away,

125
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,840
I must find out the truth for you.

126
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,480
Besides, won't you always be with me?

127
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,480
Hypothetically speaking.

128
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,360
Just hypothetically.

129
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,080
If you were still alive,

130
00:08:58,559 --> 00:08:59,440
what would you do?

131
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,840
Good question.

132
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:07,080
I would probably

133
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,200
hide

134
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,960
somewhere very secret

135
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,160
and investigate the truth secretly.

136
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:17,159
When you need me,

137
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,200
I will secretly protect you.

138
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:29,200
I think so too.

139
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,200
Let's go.

140
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,140
The unfinished building Pei Ji mentioned

141
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,639
is the last clue.

142
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,740
(Traffic Investigation
Cooperation Letter)

143
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,340
Surveillance footage during what time

144
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,720
and where?

145
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:23,679
I'll check.

146
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,240
Please help me check

147
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,679
if Pei Ji's electric bicycle

148
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:36,279
was parked near these three
unfinished buildings.

149
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:37,440
And?

150
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:41,679
And I'll go
to the unfinished building to see

151
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,720
if there's any surveillance footage
of the mysterious man.

152
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,879
The success rate is too low.

153
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,980
You also said that man asked to meet
at the unfinished building

154
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,480
to avoid surveillance cameras.

155
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:54,399
Even if a nearby dashcam

156
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,120
or a store at the corner filmed him,

157
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,500
it would be difficult for us to tell
whether it was him.

158
00:10:58,559 --> 00:10:59,840
The possibility of filming him

159
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:01,279
would only happen in movies.

160
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:05,399
It doesn't conform to the logic
of criminal investigation in reality.

161
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,680
If you want to teach me,
just tell me directly.

162
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,880
Don't keep me in suspense.

163
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:18,060
No surveillance cameras
near the unfinished building,

164
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,240
but given the mysterious man's

165
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,600
cautious style,

166
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:21,919
he'll only meet Pei Ji

167
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:23,759
after making sure no one

168
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:24,799
is following him.

169
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,750
These 14 surveillance videos

170
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,000
of Pei Ji were taken

171
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,960
on the night of May 8th.

172
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,550
The mysterious person

173
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,600
must be among

174
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:35,000
those who followed Pei Ji.

175
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,080
But like you said,

176
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:41,600
it's difficult for us to determine

177
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,500
which one is the mysterious person
even if he's here.

178
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,399
It's simple.

179
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,840
The mysterious person knows Pei Ji

180
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,840
very well.

181
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,159
May 4th.

182
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,440
Pei Ji was blackmailed and threatened

183
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:53,480
after meeting Man Ni.

184
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,980
And the mysterious person
immediately gave him a solution.

185
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:01,440
Such timely response measures

186
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,240
will only happen in one situation.

187
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,940
The mysterious person
has been following Pei Ji.

188
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,960
Next comes
the most exciting and difficult

189
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,540
investigation and comparison.

190
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:17,679
Fortunately,

191
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:19,960
your brain is different
from everyone else's.

192
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:20,840
So as long as

193
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,279
you find two similar figures

194
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,879
on May 4th and May 8th,

195
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,759
two places that are miles apart,

196
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:28,559
you win.

197
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,120
It's just a matter of time
for you, right?

198
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,790
And this is a criminal investigation?

199
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:36,480
Chapter 7, Section 2.

200
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,399
Tracking and tailing method
and surveillance investigation method.

201
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:42,559
Did you make that up?

202
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,639
Good luck.

203
00:12:57,639 --> 00:12:58,519
Get in.

204
00:12:58,879 --> 00:12:59,600
Get in.

205
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,320
I didn't take drugs.

206
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,600
Shut up.

207
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:03,960
Shut up and back up.

208
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,039
Let me out.

209
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,700
Aren't you willing to confess?

210
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,450
If you don't want to confess,
just calm down

211
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,320
and think carefully.

212
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,159
I didn't take drugs.

213
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:11,919
Problems.

214
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:14,360
Sit down.

215
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:19,039
What do you mean by this?

216
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,080
I understand if you're investigating

217
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,160
people involved in the case,

218
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,760
but why is Liao Siyuan included?

219
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,559
Do you think a university student
who helps us solve crime

220
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,639
is a drug addict?

221
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,159
Do you remember him?

222
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,670
Isn't this the person

223
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,650
who was sent here for an autopsy
a few days ago?

224
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,960
His cause of death
was an overdose of AH7.

225
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:51,639
His name is Mike.

226
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:53,639
He's involved in Lai La's case.

227
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,679
We found out
that the source of his AH7

228
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,280
was the mailbox at his house entrance.

229
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,639
But the murderer

230
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,400
placed a large number of AH7 in one go.

231
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,460
He was inexperienced

232
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,000
and died of a drug overdose.

233
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:07,320
Lai La, Man Ni,

234
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,879
Nu Na, and Lin

235
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:10,519
died because of AH7.

236
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:12,679
So did Mike.

237
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,559
A drug that hasn't appeared in ten years

238
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,919
suddenly appeared frequently.

239
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:18,559
Why do you think that is?

240
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:23,000
Just say whatever you want to say.

241
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:24,480
Sure.

242
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Don't you think

243
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,879
your brother has grown a little too fast

244
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,759
in the past half month?

245
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,720
Not only did he always find the murderer

246
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,159
before us,

247
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:39,629
but he was also careful
in solving cases at the scene

248
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,080
and could predict the enemy's moves.

249
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,390
So I deduced

250
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,440
that someone
had been secretly teaching him all this.

251
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,039
After the fire incident ten years ago,

252
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:09,240
Siyuan disappeared.

253
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,080
After half a year,

254
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,639
I finally found him in an orphanage.

255
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:13,320
Back then,

256
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:14,360
he was already suffering

257
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,920
from post-traumatic stress disorder.

258
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,159
He fantasized

259
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,279
that he could see his brother,

260
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:22,559
Liao Zhibai.

261
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,550
You live in a single room

262
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,120
with meals delivered to you everyday.

263
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:29,840
Yeah.

264
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,760
Anyone who doesn't know

265
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,070
might think you're the boss here.

266
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,620
Do you know how annoying

267
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,900
your expressionless face is?

268
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,630
From today onward,

269
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,200
you're responsible
for washing my clothes.

270
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,960
Who do you think you are?

271
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:04,559
You were so heavy-handed.

272
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,360
Tell me.

273
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:11,159
What can I talk about

274
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:13,159
with you kids

275
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,510
who are ten years younger than me?

276
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,320
I live in a single room

277
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,919
just to protect you.

278
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,480
Start repeating after me.

279
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:29,440
From today onward,

280
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,960
you're not allowed to bully my brother.

281
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,399
No.

282
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,440
You're not allowed to bully me.

283
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:40,440
Repeat it!

284
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,559
According to you,

285
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,840
the way he jumped

286
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,860
is like being possessed
by another person's spirit.

287
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:58,120
If he himself has no memory of this,

288
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,240
I highly suspect

289
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,030
he has dissociative identity disorder,

290
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:04,839
also known as DID.

291
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,079
Due to his previous severe trauma,

292
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:08,920
Siyuan created an illusion

293
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,799
of his secondary personality,
Liao Zhibai,

294
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:12,200
out of self-protection.

295
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:14,000
Under normal circumstances,

296
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,240
the two of them

297
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,319
can interact and converse naturally.

298
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,119
But in extreme cases,

299
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,440
the secondary personality

300
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,270
will occupy
the primary personality's body

301
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,440
to protect the primary personality.

302
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:34,119
No, I think...

303
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,359
I'm not saying this
to excuse my brother,

304
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,119
but his recent mental state

305
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,440
has indeed affected our judgment.

306
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,599
DID is dangerous,

307
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:45,240
not only to him,

308
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:46,400
but also to us.

309
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,559
If we leave it alone,

310
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,590
his secondary personality
will gradually grow

311
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,559
and become stronger.

312
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,319
Relatively speaking,

313
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,240
the primary personality's consciousness

314
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,640
will gradually weaken.

315
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,079
Will he become Zhibai?

316
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,590
The secondary personality is imagined

317
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,960
by the primary personality.

318
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,039
If the primary personality
doesn't exist,

319
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,880
the secondary personality
naturally won't exist either.

320
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,240
So he won't become Liao Zhibai.

321
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:16,519
He'll lose his mind.

322
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,720
I know this all sounds

323
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,839
a bit unbelievable.

324
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:25,440
You're entitled to your own beliefs.

325
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,839
If you need me to do anything,

326
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,240
I will do my best,

327
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,079
but I will never

328
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:31,400
watch my brother lose his mind.

329
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,480
I'm reporting this to you

330
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:35,920
as a police officer

331
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:38,000
and a sister.

332
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,599
Because I know

333
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:41,599
Siyuan's treatment

334
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:43,839
will help you sort out your case.

335
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:47,960
Thank you.

336
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,200
What did the doctor say?

337
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,790
His current prescription
can only provide relief,

338
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,799
not cure.

339
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,200
The main focus
is on psychological therapy.

340
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,599
The fire ten years ago

341
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,240
is still fresh in Siyuan's mind.

342
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,799
He only has fragments of memory now.

343
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:11,960
What I have to do

344
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:13,920
is connect

345
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,640
all these fragments of memory together.

346
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:18,240
Only by finding the truth

347
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:20,400
can he recover.

348
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:30,319
I get it now.

349
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:33,319
You're telling me

350
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:36,039
that if Liao Siyuan

351
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:37,920
were to touch
the case from ten years ago again,

352
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,079
you would still stand on his side.

353
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,119
Right?

354
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,039
Zhibai.

355
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:31,440
Zhibai.

356
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:04,000
Careful murderers often pick

357
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:05,759
the most familiar environment to act.

358
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,760
This place is very close

359
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,560
to the unfinished building
on Suwanjong Road.

360
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,720
It's in line with his habits.

361
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:14,119
Are you sure it's here?

362
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:15,200
Yes.

363
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:18,029
According to surveillance videos

364
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:19,240
from May 4th and May 8th,

365
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,280
we can roughly determine

366
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,400
his course of action.

367
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,030
Although he deliberately changed
his course of action several times

368
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,660
and avoided some surveillance areas,

369
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,000
he always came back here.

370
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:29,920
Sure.

371
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:32,160
We mustn't alert him then.

372
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,440
Let's pretend to be guests

373
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,640
and find out.

374
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,599
What's wrong?

375
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:44,640
Come on.

376
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,270
What are you thinking about?

377
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:53,680
If...

378
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,559
I'm saying if…

379
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,920
If the real you is still alive,

380
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,920
will the you in front of me

381
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:07,440
still exist?

382
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,350
Do you still remember the text

383
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,460
we learned in English class
when we were young?

384
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:27,400
The story is about someone

385
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,599
who climbed
the highest mountain in the world.

386
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,039
And everyone around him asked him

387
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,440
why he did it.

388
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:35,279
He answered,

389
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:36,680
"It's there."

390
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:38,680
It's there.

391
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:44,240
You already have the answer in your mind.

392
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,119
You'll go up there.

393
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,359
You're still hesitating here

394
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,799
because you're afraid
of the consequences.

395
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:52,720
Siyuan.

396
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,279
You must move forward

397
00:23:57,359 --> 00:23:58,680
because only by moving forward

398
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,759
can you see the truth.

399
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:06,240
Whether

400
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,400
it's me or him staying

401
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,920
or whether it's the one you wanted,

402
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,960
you have nothing to worry about.

403
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,119
At least he's real.

404
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,680
And I...

405
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:26,279
I will always be behind you,

406
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,079
supporting you.

407
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,039
Hello.

408
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:55,640
Is anyone here?

409
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,160
Who are you?

410
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,039
Liao Siyuan?

411
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,720
How did you find this place?

412
00:25:54,279 --> 00:25:55,039
I'm sorry.

413
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,830
I was a bit too anxious just now.

414
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,240
Sit down first.

415
00:25:59,200 --> 00:25:59,759
Sit.

416
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,550
Your brother and I
were classmates in university.

417
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,460
When we were in the police academy,

418
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,160
your brother always showed us your photos.

419
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:08,850
I don't know him.

420
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:10,050
So I recognize you right away.

421
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:12,000
I don't remember most things
before I died.

422
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,750
But this guy makes me uncomfortable.

423
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,690
Look. Only criminals with a high level
of counter-surveillance awareness

424
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:18,640
would use glass cleaner
to wipe fingerprints.

425
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,920
Be careful, Siyuan.

426
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:23,960
Sit anywhere you want.

427
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,240
Here.

428
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,480
How come
you're the same as your brother?

429
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,799
You're both impatient.

430
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:56,240
I thought you were going to ask me

431
00:26:57,599 --> 00:26:58,279
about Lai La

432
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:01,920
or Pei Ji first.

433
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:13,400
Enough nonsense then.

434
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,480
You're the mysterious person

435
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,079
who set up Lai La's dismemberment

436
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,039
and instigated Pei Ji to murder.

437
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:30,160
It's me.

438
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:33,400
Lai La.

439
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,559
I can help you.

440
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,680
All the details he said match up.

441
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,680
He's indeed the real mastermind

442
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:27,759
behind these cases.

443
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:30,920
Why did you kill Song En and Nu Na?

444
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:34,680
What do they have to do

445
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,400
with our house's fire?

446
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:41,160
Go to hell and ask your brother.

447
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:44,240
Police.

448
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,519
Old pal.

449
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,079
We haven't met in ten years.

450
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,640
Is your marksmanship still this bad?

451
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:13,759
Bai Han.

452
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:15,519
What are you trying to do?

453
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,000
Chief.

454
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,830
Bring all of them back.

455
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:04,599
Yes.

456
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,720
You followed me?

457
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,920
We were keeping an eye on you.

458
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:26,440
How did you meet Bai Han?

459
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,550
If you hadn't called him by his name,

460
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,550
I wouldn't have known
his name is Bai Han.

461
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,119
How did you know each other?

462
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,900
We were police academy classmates,

463
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,220
but not familiar with each other.

464
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:41,880
Ni Ke.

465
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,000
Chief.

466
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,319
Why did he kill Song En and Nu Na?

467
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:53,920
If you hadn't asked,

468
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,200
I wouldn't have known
he killed Song En and Nu Na.

469
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,100
This is your brother's drug test report
from that year.

470
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,400
They were best friends

471
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,000
in the police academy ten years ago.

472
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,200
They always alternated

473
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,559
between first and second place in exams.

474
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:16,960
All until Liao Zhibai

475
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,920
became addicted to drugs
before graduation.

476
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:20,519
Not only that,

477
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,039
he also added drugs

478
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,340
to several other students' food.

479
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,830
Including Bai Han.

480
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:28,079
If you flip to the back,

481
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,160
you'll find Liao Zhibai's
urine test report.

482
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,599
The next page

483
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,830
is Bai Han's test report.

484
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,400
I was an intern
at Buhe City's police force.

485
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,640
I was working on another case.

486
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:40,119
I'm not entirely sure about everything,

487
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,200
but it's indeed the fact.

488
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,680
Bai Han

489
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,200
was destroyed by your brother.

490
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,880
Liao Zhibai didn't start taking drugs
all of a sudden.

491
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,500
He had been doing it for a long time.

492
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,240
Therefore, after the fire,

493
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,799
the police concluded

494
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,620
that he hallucinated due to drugs

495
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,070
and set fire to his entire family,

496
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:06,829
which was based

497
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:08,040
on sufficient factual evidence.

498
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,160
Are you not done?

499
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,559
Back to your previous question,

500
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:24,160
why kill Song En and Nu Na?

501
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,200
There's a possibility

502
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,900
that they all came from Yong'an Village

503
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,359
and were with Liao Zhibai.

504
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,799
They might even indirectly participate

505
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,799
in the poisoning operation
that destroyed Bai Han.

506
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:38,920
That's why Bai Han wants revenge.

507
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,480
This motive is completely valid.

508
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,039
Alright.

509
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,500
Thank you for your cooperation.

510
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:46,789
I'll let you know

511
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,100
if there's any news about Bai Han.

512
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,079
Hurry back.

513
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,079
Liao Siyuan.

514
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,620
I don't know who's helping you
from behind the scenes,

515
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
but I suggest you

516
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,920
stay away from Bai Han.

517
00:33:06,759 --> 00:33:08,559
Don't follow
in your brother's footsteps.

518
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,759
Apart from Nu Na and Song En,

519
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,400
this is the only person

520
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,200
whose faces can be seen in the photo.

521
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:47,799
Tai Shu

522
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:50,359
is also from Yong'an Village.

523
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:54,240
We watched him torture rabbits
together before.

524
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,519
If Bai Han is really
the mysterious person behind this,

525
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:05,039
we've already alerted him.

526
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,880
It'll be hard to find him after this.

527
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,960
The only clue left now

528
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,159
is Tai Shu.

529
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,860
Let's go back to Yong'an Village.

530
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:25,239
Siyuan.

531
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,070
You must think it through.

532
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,800
If you can't accept the worst result,

533
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,760
I advise you to stop investigating.

534
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:48,880
Siyuan.

535
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:50,960
Here.

536
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,159
Where is it from?

537
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,500
Aren't you afraid
that Ms. Meihua will find out?

538
00:34:56,599 --> 00:34:58,360
I have plenty of space to store liquor.

539
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,740
University students can't drink alcohol.

540
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,320
Here.

541
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:05,159
Are you going out?

542
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:09,709
I want...

543
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:11,590
You want to go Yong'an Village
and investigate?

544
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:17,639
Shu He told me.

545
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:19,239
You met Bai Han.

546
00:35:21,639 --> 00:35:22,679
Do you know him too?

547
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:31,840
After your brother's incident,

548
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,840
I went to his friends
like I lost my mind,

549
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,760
trying to get answers.

550
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,360
But his friends

551
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:42,239
seemed to have disappeared.

552
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,360
That means you never saw Bai Han again

553
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:48,079
after my brother's incident?

554
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:55,320
All until I became a forensic doctor.

555
00:35:56,559 --> 00:35:59,800
While entering records one time,

556
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:02,960
I came across their drug test reports.

557
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:06,559
That's when I learned

558
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,920
that they were expelled
from the police academy

559
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,920
for taking drugs.

560
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,550
Do you also believe that he takes drugs?

561
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,920
What kind of person is he

562
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:28,159
in your heart?

563
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,079
He's

564
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:37,920
arrogant, impulsive,

565
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,639
proud, and stubborn.

566
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,640
He acts like
there's nothing in this world

567
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:44,840
that he can't solve.

568
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,400
Once he believes
something to be the truth,

569
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,840
he'll do anything
to investigate it thoroughly,

570
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:53,320
no matter the cost.

571
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,599
Siyuan.

572
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,639
I refused to believe it either,

573
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,320
but I've seen his drug test report.

574
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,920
His urine test result
came back positive.

575
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,079
You already knew?

576
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,159
Why didn't you tell me then?

577
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:28,519
What's the point of telling you?

578
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:33,280
Why should I let you suffer

579
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:36,360
what I've already suffered?

580
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:46,760
He's no longer around,

581
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,159
but you're still alive.

582
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:54,280
So I thought

583
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,639
it would be good

584
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,960
if you had a good impression of him

585
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,880
in your memory.

586
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,559
What about you?

587
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,519
Me?

588
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,519
I'm already used to it.

589
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,639
I thought of many possibilities.

590
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:23,159
Why would he do that?

591
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:26,159
Was it because

592
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,159
he was undercover
and wanted to protect himself

593
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,400
or because he was forced to do so

594
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,700
and was unable to prove himself?

595
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:36,119
Or

596
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,360
he was indeed a scum?

597
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,800
But I believe

598
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,800
that one day the truth will come out.

599
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:00,159
Xia.

600
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:02,360
Let's go together.

601
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:05,639
I found a clue.

602
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:13,400
Tai Shu?

603
00:39:51,134 --> 00:39:52,930
(May 29th, Yong'an Village's Fire)

604
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,280
How could it be you who is behind this?

605
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:18,920
I'm the one
who archived the autopsy reports.

606
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,159
If possible,

607
00:40:39,559 --> 00:40:40,920
it would be nice to see you again.

608
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:04,540
(Qi's Pharmacy)

609
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:06,639
Liao Siyuan, hurry up.

610
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:11,159
Hurry up.

611
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,280
When Mom comes back after drinking

612
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:14,559
and sees us,

613
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:15,639
neither of us can leave.

614
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:18,960
You two.

615
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:21,159
We're doomed.

616
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:23,800
What you fear most
always finds its way to you.

617
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,079
Go back first. Let's go.

618
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,639
You two!

619
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,440
I'm talking to you two.

620
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,519
Where are you going?

621
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:39,519
Our school's organizing

622
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:40,840
a camping trip.

623
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,840
We have to go three...

624
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,300
Five days and three nights.

625
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,860
Xia happens to be on her annual leave,

626
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,040
so I'm taking her with me.

627
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,070
She can drive.

628
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,079
Camping?

629
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,079
I haven't gone to one for a long time.

630
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:55,550
I want to join you too.

631
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:56,679
I'll pack my bags now.

632
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,679
Mom.

633
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,159
The ones going are all young people.

634
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:01,400
Young people?

635
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,280
Do you think I'm old?

636
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,119
No.

637
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,040
Their school has a rule

638
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,940
that says family members
aren't allowed to join.

639
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:08,720
They're all kids.

640
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:10,300
What's the point of playing with them?

641
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,440
We don't drink either.

642
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:15,760
What school doesn't allow drinking
and doesn't allow parents to join?

643
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:17,800
It will close down sooner or later.

644
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,360
Li Zhi.

645
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,519
Hurry.

646
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:23,150
What's the matter, Ms. Meihua?

647
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:25,280
This is Li Zhi.

648
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:26,880
My son, Liao Siyuan.

649
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:28,519
My daughter, Qi Xia.

650
00:42:29,159 --> 00:42:30,440
My good friend, Li Zhi,

651
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,740
is from the same school as you.

652
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,060
Thanks to her for blocking the drinks
for me last night.

653
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:36,880
Otherwise, those persons
would have gotten me drunk.

654
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:40,000
Good friend?

655
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,280
Hello, Aunt Li Zhi.

656
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:44,719
Darn you!

657
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,039
Hey!

658
00:42:46,039 --> 00:42:47,159
We know each other.

659
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:48,920
We're classmates.

660
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:49,760
We know each other.

661
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:51,639
Yes, you're from the same school.

662
00:42:51,639 --> 00:42:52,800
Aren't you going camping?

663
00:42:53,159 --> 00:42:54,000
Are you not going?

664
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:55,480
Yes, camping.

665
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,159
I'm going.

666
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,360
My car happened to run out of gas.

667
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,519
I'll carpool with you later.

668
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:00,760
Sure, no problem.

669
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:03,000
You just filled up your car with gas.

670
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,800
How come they're together?

671
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,880
How would I know?

672
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:13,559
I knew it.

673
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:15,840
Alright.

674
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,159
Good luck.

675
00:43:19,159 --> 00:43:19,920
It's late.

676
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:20,639
Hurry and pack up.

677
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:21,549
Or we'll be late.

678
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:22,790
- I haven't taken my bag.
- Go.

679
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:23,640
I'll go help him.

680
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:24,920
Xia.

681
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:31,760
Mom.

682
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:38,800
You two think you're all grown up now.

683
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,580
Each one is more stubborn than the last.

684
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:42,040
If it hadn't run into you head-on,

685
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:43,580
you would have been somewhere now.

686
00:43:46,199 --> 00:43:47,159
Tell me the truth.

687
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:48,880
Where on earth are you going?

688
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,599
We're just going out for a few days.

689
00:43:53,639 --> 00:43:54,559
I don't believe you.

690
00:43:54,559 --> 00:43:55,639
It's true.

691
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:58,639
Alright.

692
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:01,440
All that matters is that you're happy.

693
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:03,639
We're going.

694
00:44:08,519 --> 00:44:09,519
Alright, we're going.

695
00:44:09,519 --> 00:44:10,079
Okay.

696
00:44:10,199 --> 00:44:11,320
Don't drink so much.

697
00:44:12,039 --> 00:44:12,920
You're so fussy.

698
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:15,080
I'll have fun with you again
when I'm back.

699
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:15,660
Sure.

700
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:17,000
Drive safe.

701
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:19,620
Take good care of your brother.

702
00:44:19,639 --> 00:44:20,760
Don't worry!

703
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,639
Have fun!
