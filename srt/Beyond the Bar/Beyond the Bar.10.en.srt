00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:35,953
BEYOND THE BAR

2
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:40,040
FRUITS & VEGETABLES

3
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,299
Kang Hyo-min speaking.

4
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:38,719
<i>Ms. Kang Hyo-min?</i>

5
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:39,678
Yes.

6
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:43,724
This is Detective Han Su-cheol
from the Jicheong Violent Crimes Unit.

7
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:45,684
What can I do for you?

8
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,854
Ms. Kim Yeong-mi was arrested today
on suspicion of murder.

9
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,230
During questioning,

10
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:53,358
she said you were her attorney,
so I'm contacting you.

11
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,861
- Kim Yeong-mi?
<i>- Yes.</i>

12
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:59,364
Do you have any personal connection
to Ms. Kim Yeong-mi,

13
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:01,700
<i>or have you represented her in the past?</i>

14
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:02,743
No.

15
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,786
I don't think I know her.

16
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:09,291
She's refused to cooperate
without legal counsel.

17
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:11,501
You must be busy,

18
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:14,421
but can you come to the station
to confirm this in person?

19
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,380
Okay.

20
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:17,674
I will.

21
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:31,104
Ms. Kim Yeong-mi.

22
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:34,524
Ms. Kang Hyo-min is here.

23
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:36,485
You came.

24
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,737
Why don't you two talk?

25
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,334
Have we

26
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,879
met before?

27
00:04:58,215 --> 00:04:59,841
I knew you wouldn't remember me.

28
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,760
Sorry?

29
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:05,263
You're partly responsible
for what happened to me.

30
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,474
That's why

31
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,185
I'm asking you to represent me.

32
00:05:18,232 --> 00:05:22,739
BYSTANDER

33
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:24,950
Doesn't ring a bell.

34
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,410
Same here.

35
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:31,456
Yeong-mi is a common name,
so I think I've heard it somewhere.

36
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,542
You met her and still don't remember her?

37
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:34,501
No.

38
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,002
We know all of your friends.

39
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:39,172
Then could she be a friend
from high school?

40
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:40,924
Maybe.

41
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,301
High school was
the only time we weren't together.

42
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:44,719
I don't think we were friends.

43
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:47,389
She's older than me
and didn't go to high school.

44
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,599
Maybe you know the victim, then.

45
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,852
I checked that too, but the victim

46
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:54,479
only graduated from middle school,
and it was different from ours.

47
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:56,314
Neither of them went to high school?

48
00:05:56,398 --> 00:06:00,485
The victim went to high school in the US.

49
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:02,946
It seems she moved after middle school.

50
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:07,492
So, what will you do?

51
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:08,660
Are you taking the case?

52
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,538
Not taking the case feels wrong,

53
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,915
but saying yes means
I'll deal with a criminal case.

54
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:17,129
On top of that,
the firm won't approve it as pro bono,

55
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,753
so I'd have to charge a fee.

56
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:22,257
But there's no way
Ms. Kim Yeong-mi could afford that.

57
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,762
By the way, when can we go in?

58
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:30,098
Which treatment are you getting today?

59
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,182
The one she got.

60
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:33,894
It's really good.

61
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,732
Ms. Kang Hyo-min.

62
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:41,610
See you.

63
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,329
Does it hurt a lot?

64
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,538
No.

65
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:55,123
You can relax.

66
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,124
All right.

67
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,126
- I'll get started.
- Okay.

68
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:08,470
Look how plump her skin looks.

69
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,597
Right? It works really well.

70
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,182
I should get it too.

71
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,476
Do we get a group discount
if we all get it?

72
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:15,685
I'm not sure.

73
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,020
Ask them when you go.

74
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,939
Let's go together. All three of us.

75
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:20,357
Okay.

76
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:21,900
Yeong-mi Kim.

77
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,407
Yeong-mi Kim… Kim Yeong-mi.

78
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,913
KIM YEONG-MI
SANGRIM HIGH, HANMUN MIDDLE SCHOOL

79
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:01,648
You're smiling again.

80
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:19,332
That must be Ms. Choi.

81
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:43,523
The scent's gone already.

82
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:12,802
Yes.

83
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:16,723
Good grief.

84
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,229
Good grief.

85
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,149
What's going on?

86
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:28,902
A lot of things are going on.

87
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,238
What do you think is our team's problem?

88
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,411
I don't think there's
a particular problem.

89
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:42,290
Our team is way too dry.

90
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:43,583
We're so dry.

91
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:47,462
Our team would make a desert
look like an oasis.

92
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:50,340
Is that so?

93
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:57,263
Don't you think
we also should be having team dinners?

94
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:58,848
We just had one a while ago.

95
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:01,184
Don't tell me
you only want one once a year.

96
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:04,854
You didn't even join the dinner last time.

97
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,524
Okay, let's have a team dinner.

98
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,775
Yes!

99
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,319
Since we're on the subject,

100
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,863
why not have it today?

101
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,491
If the rest of the team
can make it, why not?

102
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,868
Since team dinners are
an extension of work,

103
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,121
I'll make sure every person attends.

104
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:22,455
Don't force them, though.

105
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:25,750
We don't do this often.
Even missing one person kills the vibe.

106
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:28,002
Especially Ms. Heo Min-jeong,

107
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:31,089
who didn't attend last time.
I'll make sure she comes today.

108
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,595
Why are you looking at me like that?

109
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,766
I mean, I felt it last time too.

110
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:45,812
Ms. Heo seems to be a bit less committed

111
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:49,315
to our team these days.

112
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,609
Though I'm her peer…

113
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,113
I mean, since I'm her peer,

114
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:58,158
I feel like it's my job
to give her a proper talking-to.

115
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:01,619
What do you think?

116
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,583
Let me know when the venue is set.

117
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,209
I will.

118
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:10,128
I'm on it.

119
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,715
She's so dead.

120
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:18,803
- Here's to a hard day's work!
- To a hard day's work!

121
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:19,971
Enjoy, everyone.

122
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,518
Glasses up. Come on.

123
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:28,146
- Back-to-back.
- No breaks.

124
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,772
Cheers!

125
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:36,863
That's enough.

126
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:43,745
Eat it with other dishes.

127
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,206
- It melts in your mouth.
- Eat quickly.

128
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:49,125
- No time to talk. Eat up.
- Eat it.

129
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:55,632
It's so good.

130
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,188
Alright, then. Shall we do a wave toast?

131
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,147
- Yes!
- Yes!

132
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,190
I love a wave toast.

133
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,359
Let me mix the liquor.

134
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:15,944
You're no good.

135
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:17,237
Let me.

136
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,072
Can you mix beer and soju?

137
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,448
I'm an expert.

138
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,117
- Okay.
- Give me the glasses.

139
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:25,245
Everyone must have been
waiting for tonight.

140
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:27,080
The ratio of beer and soju is crucial.

141
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,039
Totally. I know.

142
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:29,874
You're pouring too much soju!

143
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,626
- A bit more.
- How much beer are you pouring?

144
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,878
- Hey, shush!
- Pour just a little less.

145
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:35,505
Hey!

146
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,965
You said you're an expert.

147
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:37,924
I'll do it.

148
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:48,101
What are you up to?

149
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:52,855
I just needed to get some fresh air.

150
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:54,941
Are you okay?

151
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:58,861
Did everything go okay
at the police station the other day?

152
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:03,074
We've all been too cautious to ask you

153
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,451
about what happened.

154
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,581
I'm still thinking.

155
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,459
What happened?

156
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,546
My mom's always had trouble with men.

157
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,257
She's a smart woman,

158
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,592
but she just doesn't have an eye for men.

159
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:24,846
When her current boyfriend
heard I was a lawyer,

160
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,723
he talked my mom

161
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,267
into pulling a scam by using my name.

162
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:32,729
I guess some people still
take a lawyer's word as gospel.

163
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:36,649
The victim is demanding 20 million won,

164
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:39,527
saying they'll get my mom
sent to jail if she doesn't pay.

165
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:44,782
Our entire savings, including the deposit
for our home, is exactly 20 million won.

166
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,826
What a coincidence.

167
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:53,166
But it's just enough to avoid debt.
Maybe the universe is helping us.

168
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,336
Twenty million won
might not be much to some,

169
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:59,756
but I spent all of my teens and twenties

170
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,675
working part-time jobs to save that money.

171
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:07,930
Don't tell me you're planning
to use that money for a settlement.

172
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,434
What else can I do?

173
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,227
If anything,

174
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:17,440
I think that would be
doing a disservice to your mother.

175
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,276
It could lead to a bigger crime later on.

176
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:23,780
If a parent jumps into a fire,

177
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,449
does being a good child mean
jumping in after them?

178
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,910
If you take care of this for her,

179
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,788
you might actually take away
her chance for a clean start.

180
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:35,458
It's better that she learns her lesson now
and starts over.

181
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,211
That's a new perspective.

182
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:42,840
Thank you. I'll think about it.

183
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:55,353
Shall we go for round two?

184
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:56,354
- Yes!
- Yes!

185
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,147
What do you mean, round two?

186
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,650
We keep it simple.
Just dinner with drinks, and that's it.

187
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,860
That's so cold.

188
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:05,321
Round two crew, assemble!

189
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:06,614
- Here!
- Here!

190
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,325
I'm drunk. I'll get going.

191
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,451
Thank you.

192
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:11,494
Come on.

193
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,914
Seriously, she's so heartless.

194
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:16,582
This is no fun.

195
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,335
- I'm going as well.
- What?

196
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,504
Thank you for the dinner. Bye.

197
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,256
- So heartless.
- I am!

198
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,715
- You're no fun.
- I'm not!

199
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:27,468
I need to go as well.

200
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:29,804
Okay. See you tomorrow.

201
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,598
So dry. Too dry.

202
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,393
A word, Ms. Choi?

203
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:36,394
Sorry?

204
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:38,563
Okay.

205
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,027
Who's still up for round two?

206
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:54,787
Here.

207
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:56,247
What are these?

208
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,583
I bought some clothes for the twins.

209
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,293
Thank you.

210
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,752
Also, the firm offers

211
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:03,629
housing deposit loans
to eligible associates

212
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:06,132
at rates lower than the market average.

213
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:09,177
Once you pass the evaluation
and officially join as an associate,

214
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,887
I'll help you to take advantage of this.

215
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,430
Okay.

216
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,140
With the benefit,

217
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:18,352
it'd be nice for you to move to a place
where the twins can be more comfortable.

218
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,105
Thank you so much.

219
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,155
But I won't give you a high score
just because you're the breadwinner.

220
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,491
Of course, I understand.

221
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,576
Still,

222
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:36,704
if you ever need an adult to lean on,

223
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:39,332
don't go looking elsewhere.
Just come to me.

224
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:43,252
Okay.

225
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:46,339
Thank you, Mr. Yoon.

226
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,277
<i>When did I say you could come in?</i>

227
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,029
I'm thirsty, that's all.

228
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,031
Hey!

229
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,409
Shall we have one more beer?

230
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:16,452
Do you have any?

231
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:19,455
I'm very drunk

232
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:20,665
and about to go to bed.

233
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,124
And you're going to leave.

234
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,751
Then get me some water at least.

235
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,025
Listen.

236
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,571
I'm saying this as your close friend.

237
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,156
This woman is off limits.

238
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,366
Why?

239
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,409
I'm older than you--

240
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:57,577
It doesn't matter.

241
00:17:58,119 --> 00:17:59,078
I've been married.

242
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,498
- I even have a kid.
- She's all grown up.

243
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:04,375
I can't have a baby.

244
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,252
That's for the gods to decide.

245
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,129
You're overstepping.

246
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,173
- I won't have any more.
- I won't force you to.

247
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:13,384
What?

248
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:15,344
What else?

249
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:18,264
Why am I even having
this conversation with you?

250
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:25,896
Then let's just date.

251
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:29,358
Fine.

252
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,527
Let's say I won't get married.

253
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:33,904
How about you?
Do you have unlimited time?

254
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:36,073
Doesn't the opportunity cost scare you?

255
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:38,868
- Don't you plan on getting married?
- I will. I want to.

256
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,245
- With someone I love.
- Exactly.

257
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:42,872
You're the one I love.

258
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:45,958
How could I marry someone else
with you around?

259
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,008
You…

260
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:59,013
I don't deserve you.

261
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,683
You think so?

262
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,521
Then let's do what drunk people do.

263
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:09,357
What?

264
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,108
Make a mistake.

265
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:22,453
This is a mistake, okay?

266
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:24,955
Whatever you say.

267
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,818
<i>X equals negative b, plus or minus.</i>

268
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,028
<i>X equals negative b, plus or minus…</i>

269
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,706
<i>X equals negative b, plus or minus…</i>

270
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:12,545
THE PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICS

271
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,560
- Too bad for you!
- You like that?

272
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,103
Look at her.

273
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:41,574
<i>Time for a cigarette burn.</i>

274
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:49,540
Give me a break.

275
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,542
Every freaking night!

276
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,669
Shouldn't she be in solitary confinement?

277
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:56,839
How can we sleep with a psycho like her?

278
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,678
LAWYER KANG HYO-MIN
GAINS FAME FOR SAVING UNKNOWN ARTIST

279
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,009
I HAD TO RUN AN ERRAND BEFORE WORK
SEE YOU

280
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,720
So you ran off?

281
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:48,933
We'll see each other at the office anyway.

282
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:15,751
What do I do?

283
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:19,880
PTSD?

284
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:22,800
Yes. That's the doctor's opinion.

285
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,260
She's extremely anxious

286
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,595
and wakes up screaming from nightmares

287
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:28,430
almost every night.

288
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:31,058
She says she feels numbness and pain too.

289
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:34,270
The other inmates are becoming
more and more disgruntled,

290
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,564
so we are monitoring
the situation closely.

291
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:38,566
I see.

292
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:45,322
X equals negative b, plus or minus

293
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:47,950
the square root of b squared minus 4ac.

294
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:51,120
X equals

295
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:55,124
negative b, plus or minus the square root
of b squared minus 4a…

296
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:01,338
How are you doing?

297
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:05,551
Negative…

298
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,429
Ms. Kim Yeong-mi.

299
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:10,931
You know what?

300
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,852
I was top of my year
throughout middle school

301
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:16,520
and high school.

302
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,064
I see.

303
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:22,860
I read you only finished middle school.

304
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:26,447
I dropped out at the end
of my second year of high school.

305
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:29,408
I was

306
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,744
a victim of severe school bullying.

307
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,503
It's a cigarette burn scar.

308
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:45,257
Surprised already?

309
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:48,510
It's probably worse
than anything you're imagining.

310
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,263
Are you saying

311
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:53,307
the victim was…

312
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,266
Yes.

313
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:57,227
She was the one behind it all.

314
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:00,230
She did this to me.

315
00:24:07,321 --> 00:24:09,323
I thought I could move on.

316
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:14,036
I took the GED
and was planning to go to college,

317
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:15,913
but the pain from back then

318
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:20,334
completely consumed my body and mind.

319
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:23,796
Like someone who just got beaten up,

320
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:26,924
my whole body ached and tingled.

321
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:29,134
So I started taking
psychiatric medication.

322
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,973
But those pills ended up
eating away at my mind.

323
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:38,018
I would be out of it all day
and unable to concentrate on studying.

324
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:41,397
But I couldn't stop taking the medication.

325
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,648
Without them,

326
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:47,152
the memories
from that day would torment me.

327
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:53,826
In our first session,
you said I was partly to blame, right?

328
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,328
Have we met before?

329
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:08,090
I need to get some rest.

330
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:12,344
I think the pills are making me
a bit drowsy.

331
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:26,942
Okay.

332
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,320
Let's see who wins.

333
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:32,573
Are you looking for Ms. Heo?

334
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:33,574
Sorry?

335
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:35,576
Yes.

336
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,453
Is she out of the office again?

337
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,537
Yes.

338
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,749
She went out of town for a trial,
but she'll be back tomorrow.

339
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:45,210
- Sorry?
- It's nothing.

340
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:47,671
- Can you let me know when she's back?
- Sure.

341
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:49,506
Shall I leave a note if it's urgent?

342
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,466
No.

343
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,430
Don't tell her I looked for her, okay?

344
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,803
- Okay.
- Never.

345
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:55,888
Sure.

346
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,685
As expected, the investment agreement
contained a harmful provision.

347
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,521
It allows for the call option
to be exercised

348
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:06,815
if the CEO is accused of embezzlement.

349
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:10,527
So Bluestone lent 15 billion won

350
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:12,863
to Hynic Core Inc.,

351
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:16,825
exercised its call option to acquire
shares of Hynic Core Inc. for free,

352
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:19,369
and then sold them
to Optalyn for 120 billion won.

353
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:23,040
So Bluestone walked away
with more than 100 billion won in profit.

354
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:26,210
That really is something.

355
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:28,170
Which means

356
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,005
Mr. Ko Seung-cheol

357
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:33,175
not only took home
tens of billions in dividends

358
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:36,595
but also earned billions
in legal fees and success bonuses

359
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,430
by representing Optalyn

360
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:41,683
when it acquired
Hynic Core Inc. from Bluestone.

361
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:44,228
And that solidified his position

362
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:47,189
as a rainmaker within Yullim.

363
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:50,859
But do you think Mr. Ko
really planned all this?

364
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:52,653
Mr. Ko

365
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:57,741
must have known that Optalyn
was after Hynic Core's technology

366
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:01,703
because Optalyn has been
one of his longtime clients.

367
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:03,664
But at the time,

368
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:06,375
Yullim was representing
both Hynic Core Inc. and Optalyn,

369
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,460
so it couldn't have directly advised

370
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:12,005
on Optalyn's planned acquisition.

371
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:15,467
If that's true, it's a violation
of the Attorney-at-Law Act.

372
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:20,305
That's why he brought in Bluestone,
where he is a beneficiary.

373
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:21,515
Exactly.

374
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:24,393
A beneficiary of an investment trust
has no managerial authority,

375
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,271
so on the surface,
it looks like they can't interfere.

376
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,273
But in reality,

377
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:33,068
he was probably pulling all the strings
from behind the asset management company.

378
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:34,444
So it's basically an OEM setup.

379
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,530
OEM FUND
FUND WITH IMPROPER INVESTOR INTERVENTION

380
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,365
But even if Mr. Ko
is secretly a beneficiary,

381
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:39,908
isn't it still a conflict of interest?

382
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:42,744
On the surface,
Bluestone is an investment trust,

383
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:46,999
so the asset management company holds
all operational and decision-making power.

384
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:49,835
Mr. Ko is just a beneficiary on paper.

385
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:52,671
Plus, because the investment
was made indirectly through an SPV,

386
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,756
a company created
solely for a particular project,

387
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:58,218
there's no direct
legal conflict of interest.

388
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:02,598
Still, to avoid any potential controversy,

389
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:05,142
he got a conflict waiver,
consenting to a potential conflict.

390
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,393
How thorough.

391
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:10,439
Then it would be hard to find any evidence
that this was an OEM setup.

392
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:13,525
Even if he was secretly calling the shots
through the asset management company,

393
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:15,360
there's no way
he would've left any evidence.

394
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:18,780
I might just have the answer.

395
00:28:23,744 --> 00:28:25,078
Okay, Dad.

396
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:28,874
Mom asked me to have dinner with her,
so I was planning to head over

397
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,209
to the campus.

398
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:31,710
Yes.

399
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,171
Okay.

400
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:35,130
See you later.

401
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:51,730
How dare you represent
the murderer who killed my daughter?

402
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:54,107
How could you?

403
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:55,400
How?

404
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:58,654
How could you defend that evil monster?

405
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,281
What's going on?

406
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:02,824
Who are you?

407
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:04,451
Move!

408
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:07,037
I need to talk to that lawyer,
Kang Hyo-min,

409
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,498
or whatever the hell her name is.

410
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:28,141
Pretty sick, right?

411
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:34,022
Get up!

412
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:47,411
You can't do this here. Please leave.

413
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:52,291
Yes?

414
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:57,879
Hyo-min.

415
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:00,215
Kim Yeong-mi.

416
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,344
Her former name was Kim So-yun.

417
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,472
She was charged with murder

418
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:09,641
for killing Choi So-yun.

419
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:17,316
Is she someone I know?

420
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:19,026
Think.

421
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,194
You owe her that much.

422
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:23,613
Choi So-yun.

423
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:27,242
I once read an interview you did
for a women's magazine.

424
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,037
They asked you
if you had any regrets in life

425
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,539
or if there was anything you'd undo.

426
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:34,916
Do you remember what you said?

427
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:40,088
You said you had no regrets

428
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,924
because even if you went back
a thousand times,

429
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:44,593
you'd make the same decisions.

430
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:49,514
You said you didn't regret
any decision you had ever made.

431
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:51,558
Is that really what you think?

432
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:54,978
Do you honestly believe
you've lived your life

433
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:56,271
without a hint of regret?

434
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:59,358
From what I know,
you haven't led such a great life.

435
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:01,777
You're nothing
but a ruthless, egocentric hypocrite.

436
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,780
You wrote laws for people
with disabilities and did volunteer work,

437
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:07,532
and yet you abandoned
your own disabled daughter.

438
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:11,119
You pushed for legislation
to protect victims of school violence,

439
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:13,330
but you turned your back on Kim So-yun.

440
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:17,751
At least try to feel some regret

441
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:19,753
so I can try to understand you.

442
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:27,844
B squared…

443
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:32,891
I remember you.

444
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:36,561
You do?

445
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:41,108
You changed your name
from Kim So-yun to Kim Yeong-mi.

446
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:42,192
I did.

447
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:45,195
I hated that name.

448
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:50,200
Why do you think Choi So-yun
did that to me?

449
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:51,660
Because we shared the same name?

450
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,703
Because I didn't lend her a textbook?

451
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:54,871
Or

452
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,708
because I was the new kid
and still came out on top?

453
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:02,212
I don't think so.

454
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:06,174
I don't think there was any reason.

455
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:09,010
There's no justification for that cruelty.

456
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:12,639
- Back then, I--
- I'm sure you had your reasons.

457
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:15,392
Bystanders always have their excuses.

458
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:16,518
But

459
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,272
no bystander is truly innocent.

460
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:22,441
The silence of a bystander

461
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:25,110
can be just as cruel as the violence

462
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:26,820
of the perpetrator.

463
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:28,947
In the end,

464
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:32,492
it's no different
from taking the perpetrator's side.

465
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:38,957
They say we're
not only responsible for our actions

466
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,919
but also for our inaction.

467
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,337
What do you

468
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:47,507
want me to do for you?

469
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:49,593
Get me acquitted

470
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:53,388
for the murder I committed.

471
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:54,473
Sorry?

472
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:55,599
I know

473
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:57,559
I committed a crime.

474
00:32:58,185 --> 00:32:59,978
But being convicted of murder

475
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,731
is the last thing I want.

476
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:12,073
You intentionally struck Choi So-yun,
and as a result,

477
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:14,618
she died.

478
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:17,162
The hardships you've experienced

479
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:20,165
may be considered
as mitigating factors in sentencing,

480
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:22,626
but it doesn't change
the fact that this was murder.

481
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:25,253
If even one person had reached out to me,

482
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:27,589
I could have been sitting
where you are now.

483
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:30,133
I would've been top of the year

484
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,177
instead of you.

485
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:34,846
I know

486
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:37,349
I'm being unreasonable.

487
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,062
But try offering me a hand.

488
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:44,231
You are…

489
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,485
all I've got now.

490
00:34:00,497 --> 00:34:01,498
MR. YOON SEOK-HOON

491
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:02,832
<i>Are you okay?</i>

492
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:20,767
Yes?

493
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:29,442
Are you okay?

494
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:31,194
What about your jacket?

495
00:34:31,278 --> 00:34:32,821
I sent it to the dry cleaner.

496
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:36,449
Thank you for helping me earlier.

497
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:41,849
Is she the mother of the victim
in the Kim Yeong-mi case?

498
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,164
Yes.

499
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:44,541
Do you know Ms. Kim?

500
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:45,625
Yes.

501
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:49,045
When I took on the case,
I didn't recognize her,

502
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,506
but we went to the same high school.

503
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:55,010
Kim Yeong-mi was a victim
of brutal school violence,

504
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:57,429
and the person who died

505
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:00,307
was the main perpetrator of it.

506
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,267
I see.

507
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:05,687
I will make sure she's found
not guilty of the murder charge

508
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,397
because I'm responsible too.

509
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:10,525
What do you mean?

510
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:15,071
OCTOBER 2013

511
00:35:25,707 --> 00:35:26,791
Bye.

512
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:28,001
Bye.

513
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:29,002
See you.

514
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,235
Are you okay?

515
00:35:58,198 --> 00:35:59,574
- So annoying.
- My gosh.

516
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:02,994
You can't just jump
into the street like that.

517
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:04,954
- Whatever.
- Are you hurt?

518
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:06,665
You didn't hit me,

519
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:08,583
and I will let it slide. So just go.

520
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:09,709
Look.

521
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:12,253
Gosh.

522
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,386
Her cell phone…

523
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:25,266
CHOI SO-YUN REALLY WENT AT IT

524
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:31,439
CIGARETTE ASH SPRINKLES! SICK!

525
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:34,389
I TOTALLY BLEW OFF STEAM TODAY

526
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:42,701
WHAT A MASTERPIECE

527
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:46,579
YOU SHOULD HAVE TIGHTENED THE TAPE

528
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:48,039
IT DOESN'T LOOK PAINFUL AT ALL

529
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:49,457
<i>Look!</i>

530
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:53,503
YOU SHOULD HAVE SMASHED HER HARDER

531
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:11,521
GGUNGYI

532
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:16,818
Hello.

533
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:21,448
Yes, I have your phone.

534
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:24,451
No. Get your mother.

535
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:25,660
I'll talk to her.

536
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:30,039
I'm convening
the school violence committee today.

537
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:31,958
The victim will be protected,

538
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:34,169
and every single perpetrator
will be expelled.

539
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:36,963
I'll also

540
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:40,592
file criminal charges
and pursue a civil claim for damages.

541
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:46,473
This is why working moms can't keep up.

542
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:48,141
You're always the last to know.

543
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:51,186
The victim

544
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:53,104
is Kim So-yun.

545
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:56,983
Doesn't her name ring a bell?

546
00:37:58,735 --> 00:37:59,736
Kim So-yun?

547
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:00,904
Yes.

548
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:03,114
That top student, Kim So-yun.

549
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:04,532
Your daughter

550
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:06,743
has always been top of her class,

551
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:10,413
but her grades have been dropping
ever since that kid transferred in, right?

552
00:38:10,497 --> 00:38:12,957
Look at you, helping the girl

553
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:15,126
who's outshining your own daughter.

554
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,087
Do you honestly

555
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:20,173
hear yourself?

556
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:23,301
Listen carefully, Ms. Choi,
mother of Hyo-min from Class 2-4.

557
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:27,013
No one can expel my daughter.

558
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:29,098
Her father is the chairman of the board.

559
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:31,559
Do you understand?

560
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:45,782
Oh, and my family motto is

561
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,660
"Don't ever be the one
who gets pushed around."

562
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:52,288
If my daughter gets humiliated
at the school violence committee,

563
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:55,583
don't you think her anger
might end up directed at your daughter?

564
00:38:57,794 --> 00:39:00,839
It wasn't mere inaction.
It was closer to active complicity.

565
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:03,466
My mom never stepped up.

566
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,180
I also let that incident slip by.

567
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:12,350
Not long after, Kim So-yun

568
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:14,018
dropped out,

569
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:16,980
and Choi So-yun left
for the US to study abroad.

570
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:21,401
I can't believe I forgot
about this incident.

571
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:25,822
I believe I have a responsibility
as a bystander.

572
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:30,076
So if there's anything
I can do now, I'd like to help.

573
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:33,913
I'd like to take the lead on this case.

574
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:35,498
I'll also deliver the oral argument.

575
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:40,295
Are you sure about that?
It's your first criminal case.

576
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,547
Yes. I can do this.

577
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:45,884
All right, then.

578
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:47,719
Thank you.

579
00:39:52,265 --> 00:39:53,641
You seem

580
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:56,978
to have a way of drawing people in.

581
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:58,688
I do?

582
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:01,691
- Do you think so?
- Why, of course.

583
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:05,862
Sometimes, when someone is too perfect,

584
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:09,782
they lose a bit of charm,

585
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:13,745
but with you, it's different.
You have it all,

586
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:18,291
but there's this subtle sense of space.

587
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:19,876
But I think

588
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:22,921
that sense of space
only makes you even more captivating.

589
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:30,345
I wonder what kind of space that is.

590
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:31,471
The kind of space

591
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:34,015
that feels like it's meant to

592
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:36,476
remain unfilled.

593
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,103
It makes me

594
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:42,607
want to fill

595
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:44,817
that space.

596
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,560
COURT IN SESSION

597
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,813
FIRST CRIMINAL TRIAL HEARING
FOR THE MURDER CHARGE

598
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:25,149
Counsel, could you repeat that, please?

599
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:27,902
The defendant pleads not guilty.

600
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:29,654
What on earth?

601
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,656
How is she not guilty?

602
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:34,033
My daughter was murdered!

603
00:41:34,117 --> 00:41:36,953
Those in the gallery, please remain quiet.

604
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:39,247
Sit down.

605
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,206
Counsel,

606
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:42,500
are you fully aware
that pleading not guilty

607
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,752
to the murder charge

608
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:47,463
could put the defendant
at a severe disadvantage

609
00:41:47,547 --> 00:41:49,507
in the broader context of this case?

610
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:52,635
Yes, that has been fully considered.

611
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:54,637
However, in this case,
the defendant's actions

612
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:57,849
do not constitute murder under the law.

613
00:41:58,558 --> 00:42:00,518
For a murder charge to be established,

614
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:03,146
both subjective and objective elements
must be present.

615
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:04,605
In other words,

616
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:08,651
the intent to kill and the act of killing
must occur simultaneously.

617
00:42:08,735 --> 00:42:10,611
That was not the case here.

618
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:12,905
Let me explain with a simple example.

619
00:42:12,989 --> 00:42:16,784
If person A thought about killing person B

620
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:19,162
but took no action,

621
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:20,830
it does not constitute murder.

622
00:42:21,456 --> 00:42:23,750
If, on the following day,
person A had a change of heart

623
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:26,794
and no longer intended to kill person B,

624
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:30,673
but person B died due to person A
accidentally dropping something,

625
00:42:30,757 --> 00:42:33,342
this too would not constitute murder.

626
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:34,719
This is because

627
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:38,556
the intent and the action
did not take place at the same time.

628
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:42,769
The same applies to the defendant,
Kim Yeong-mi.

629
00:42:42,852 --> 00:42:46,689
<i>The first act,</i>
<i>the blow with a blunt object,</i>

630
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:51,360
<i>was made with intent to injure,</i>
<i>but it did not lead to the victim's death.</i>

631
00:42:51,444 --> 00:42:52,862
The second act,

632
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:56,365
<i>the collision which resulted</i>
<i>in the victim's death,</i>

633
00:42:56,449 --> 00:42:58,868
<i>was not carried out with any intent</i>

634
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:02,789
<i>but instead occurred</i>
<i>under unforeseeable circumstances.</i>

635
00:43:02,872 --> 00:43:04,248
Therefore,

636
00:43:04,332 --> 00:43:06,793
this case must be assessed
in two separate parts.

637
00:43:06,876 --> 00:43:08,920
The first act
should be treated as assault,

638
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:13,758
and the second falls under
the charge of death by traffic accident.

639
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:14,967
I understand.

640
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:16,135
Hyo-min is a genius.

641
00:43:16,219 --> 00:43:17,136
Prosecution.

642
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,429
She's awesome.

643
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:20,389
Do you wish to amend the charges?

644
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:26,270
Your Honor, the prosecution believes

645
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:29,398
the attack was carried out
with clear intent to kill.

646
00:43:29,482 --> 00:43:32,026
We will therefore maintain

647
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:35,738
the murder charge as the primary charge.

648
00:43:35,822 --> 00:43:36,697
However,

649
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:39,867
in case the court finds

650
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:42,203
that the elements
of murder are not satisfied,

651
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:43,412
we will add attempted murder

652
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:45,498
and injury resulting in death
as alternative charges.

653
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:49,043
We will also include
charges of assault and death

654
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:52,046
under the Special Act
on Traffic Accident Settlement.

655
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:53,256
Counsel,

656
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:56,551
do you have any objections
to the amendment of the indictment?

657
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:57,885
No, Your Honor.

658
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:01,681
We've made our move,

659
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:03,975
and now it's time to find the final blow.

660
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:04,934
Yes.

661
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:08,563
It's overwhelming,
but I'm going to do my best.

662
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:12,066
No matter how well
you write the brief or argue in court,

663
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,776
that alone won't win the case.

664
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:17,738
Only well-polished gems
make brilliant jewels.

665
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:19,157
The key is to uncover

666
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,868
the hidden gems
among the facts that favor us.

667
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:26,164
Advocacy, like polishing a gem,
can present arguments effectively,

668
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:28,583
but it cannot create substantive facts.

669
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,251
I understand.

670
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:32,253
I have a prior commitment.

671
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:34,463
Bye.

672
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:40,803
You rocked today,

673
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:43,139
Attorney Kang.

674
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:46,893
You were so cool, Attorney Kang.

675
00:44:46,976 --> 00:44:48,269
Thank you.

676
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:51,230
I need to go see the accident site.

677
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:52,899
You've already been there.

678
00:44:52,982 --> 00:44:54,775
There might be something I'm missing.

679
00:44:54,859 --> 00:44:57,278
You're not an investigator.
Why go that far?

680
00:44:57,361 --> 00:45:00,448
I should see if I can dig up a real gem.

681
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:03,701
I heard you even offered
to pay the attorney's fee.

682
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:05,494
Really?

683
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:07,955
Aren't you taking it too far?

684
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:11,751
We'll help you.

685
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:13,002
Just say the word. We'll help.

686
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:14,170
What can we do?

687
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:15,504
Shall we look for a gem?

688
00:45:30,645 --> 00:45:31,520
MOM

689
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:39,111
<i>I emailed you some reference materials.</i>
<i>Have a look.</i>

690
00:45:39,654 --> 00:45:42,531
<i>And I transferred</i>
<i>the amount of Kim Yeong-mi's legal fee</i>

691
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:44,116
<i>to your account.</i>

692
00:45:44,617 --> 00:45:45,743
<i>Ji-eun told me.</i>

693
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:47,954
Why did she tell my mom?

694
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:54,252
Why would Mom pay for the fee?

695
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:03,427
I CAN TAKE CARE OF IT
WHY ARE YOU BUTTING IN?

696
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:19,318
I SENT YOU SOME REFERENCE MATERIALS
HAVE A LOOK

697
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:32,248
This is it.

698
00:46:57,356 --> 00:47:00,609
Sorry for asking to meet
somewhere like this instead of the office.

699
00:47:00,693 --> 00:47:01,569
No way!

700
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:02,862
I love it here.

701
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:06,157
I should ask Mr. Lee
to have meetings in places like this--

702
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,160
Mr. Lee shouldn't know about this place.

703
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:13,039
Never mind.

704
00:47:13,122 --> 00:47:14,957
Have some of this. I already ordered some.

705
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:16,250
It looks delicious.

706
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:21,297
Are you kidding me?

707
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:23,257
What the hell?

708
00:47:23,883 --> 00:47:26,635
- I'm sorry.
- Where the hell were you looking?

709
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:29,013
Damn it.

710
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:30,181
Hey.

711
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:32,725
"Hey"?

712
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:33,893
What's with the foul mouth?

713
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:36,228
- What?
- It was both our fault.

714
00:47:36,312 --> 00:47:37,688
So why the foul language?

715
00:47:37,772 --> 00:47:38,773
Hey,

716
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:40,274
I'm a customer. Are you crazy?

717
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:43,652
All this bullshit
over a damn 3,000-won Americano?

718
00:47:43,736 --> 00:47:45,613
If that gives you the right,
I'll buy one too.

719
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:48,157
You're way out of line.

720
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,158
And you aren't?

721
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:50,534
Hey!

722
00:47:50,618 --> 00:47:51,786
Where's the manager?

723
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:53,496
Get me the manager, damn it!

724
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:56,207
I'll make sure they fire your ass today!

725
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:57,833
Hey, you clueless jerk,

726
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:00,920
do you know how hard it is
to find a part-timer?

727
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:02,880
I won't get fired over some jerk.

728
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:05,841
And this isn't just some café.
It's an international chain.

729
00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:07,510
I see.

730
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:09,678
You think this is some coffee joint
from the damn '80s?

731
00:48:09,762 --> 00:48:11,097
"Damn"?

732
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:12,348
You little…

733
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:13,474
Try me.

734
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:15,559
Go on, then. Take a swing at me.

735
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:17,436
- What the--
- That way, I can beat you up.

736
00:48:18,479 --> 00:48:20,189
What the hell?

737
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:21,399
Excuse me.

738
00:48:25,403 --> 00:48:27,696
- This is for your dry cleaning.
- Are you the manager here?

739
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:28,656
No.

740
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:29,824
Why butt in, then?

741
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:30,991
You're too loud.

742
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:38,666
I'm not doing this
for some dry-cleaning money.

743
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,000
Excuse me.

744
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:41,752
What's going on?

745
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:42,711
Who are you?

746
00:48:42,795 --> 00:48:44,255
I'm the general manager here.

747
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:47,007
You won't believe

748
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:49,427
- what your worker did--
- Please leave.

749
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:50,928
What?

750
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:52,805
Just stop making a scene and leave.

751
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:54,515
Do you know what she said to me?

752
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:55,724
Okay.

753
00:48:55,808 --> 00:48:58,018
I'm asking you to leave
and stop making a scene.

754
00:48:58,102 --> 00:49:00,062
- Do you know her?
- No.

755
00:49:00,146 --> 00:49:01,730
Let's just go back to the office.

756
00:49:01,814 --> 00:49:03,190
I'll get the car.

757
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:04,233
Meet me outside.

758
00:49:14,827 --> 00:49:15,995
Why did you step in?

759
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,459
I could have taken care of it myself.

760
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:23,210
Why did you step in?

761
00:49:23,836 --> 00:49:26,005
I didn't step in because it was you.

762
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:27,506
Don't misunderstand me.

763
00:49:36,891 --> 00:49:38,767
What's your problem, anyway?

764
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:41,145
Would you be upset if it hadn't been me?

765
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:42,897
No.

766
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:44,773
You would have thanked them.

767
00:49:46,025 --> 00:49:49,195
Do children think their parents
are paying for sins from a past life?

768
00:49:49,278 --> 00:49:52,656
Do you think that we're saints
and above getting hurt?

769
00:49:53,324 --> 00:49:54,283
No.

770
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:57,453
We don't heal easily either
when we get hurt.

771
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:01,999
You think you're entitled
to yell at your parents.

772
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:05,211
Mom.

773
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:12,635
What?

774
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:14,428
Can I call you?

775
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:16,805
Yes.

776
00:50:16,889 --> 00:50:18,224
What's your number?

777
00:50:23,885 --> 00:50:28,609
YULLIM, HEO MIN-JEONG

778
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:34,949
I won't call you too often.

779
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:37,493
Okay.

780
00:50:59,223 --> 00:51:00,391
<i>How pretty.</i>

781
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:03,894
I didn't even remember if the flowers
had bloomed or started to wither.

782
00:51:03,978 --> 00:51:07,565
We should do this more often.

783
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:12,361
I heard from other lawyers

784
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:14,363
that you've improved significantly.

785
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:16,532
Not at all.

786
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:18,117
I still have a long way to go.

787
00:51:18,826 --> 00:51:19,827
But

788
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:23,163
I did put in a lot of effort.

789
00:51:24,123 --> 00:51:26,166
When I first joined the M&A team,

790
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:27,960
all the jargon was so difficult

791
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:30,879
that I barely understood
half of what was going on.

792
00:51:30,963 --> 00:51:33,173
I knew they were speaking Korean,

793
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:35,134
but it might as well have been French.

794
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:37,261
It happens. I know.

795
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:40,264
They don't teach you
those things at law school.

796
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:41,223
They don't.

797
00:51:41,307 --> 00:51:42,766
That's why

798
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:46,228
I got into the habit
of recording voice memos.

799
00:51:46,312 --> 00:51:48,647
And I just kept listening
to them over and over again

800
00:51:48,731 --> 00:51:50,608
until things finally made sense.

801
00:51:50,691 --> 00:51:52,109
It was so tough.

802
00:51:53,569 --> 00:51:54,737
That's a good idea.

803
00:51:56,989 --> 00:51:57,865
Are you cold?

804
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:59,658
- No. I'm okay.
- Please.

805
00:52:20,471 --> 00:52:21,722
CHOI YUN-GEUN
ARE YOU FREE TODAY?

806
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:22,931
WANNA GO FOR A WALK TONIGHT?

807
00:52:25,768 --> 00:52:27,186
ROOM 930, LIELSIUM HOTEL

808
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:33,692
So?

809
00:52:34,777 --> 00:52:37,821
Did you take photos or not?

810
00:52:38,656 --> 00:52:39,615
I…

811
00:52:40,366 --> 00:52:41,825
I did take them,

812
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:44,787
but they got deleted.

813
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:46,372
Hey!

814
00:52:46,455 --> 00:52:48,666
How could you screw up like that?

815
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:50,918
I'm meeting her Wednesday night.

816
00:52:51,919 --> 00:52:52,836
At a hotel.

817
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:54,546
You are?

818
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:56,548
You should have led with that.

819
00:52:57,341 --> 00:52:58,384
Ms. Kwon

820
00:52:58,467 --> 00:52:59,885
must have been desperate.

821
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:01,637
No mistakes this time.

822
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:03,597
I understand.

823
00:53:05,933 --> 00:53:06,809
Wednesday…

824
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:24,868
<i>What do you mean?</i>

825
00:53:25,703 --> 00:53:27,246
Among the surplus staff at Yullim,

826
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:29,540
there are people Mr. Ko owes a favor to.

827
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:32,000
He probably couldn't fire them himself.

828
00:53:32,084 --> 00:53:33,127
From where he's standing,

829
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:35,587
he probably wants to use you
as a tool for restructuring

830
00:53:35,671 --> 00:53:39,550
with the idea of pushing you out
once the job is done.

831
00:53:40,843 --> 00:53:41,969
Will he go that far?

832
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:43,721
It makes sense.

833
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:48,308
Someone under Mr. Ko

834
00:53:48,392 --> 00:53:51,228
will start laying the groundwork
to get rid of you.

835
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:52,646
He hates

836
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:55,065
getting his hands dirty,

837
00:53:55,733 --> 00:53:56,984
so he won't step in himself.

838
00:53:57,651 --> 00:54:01,697
Ha Du-sik did contact me
to have lunch a few days ago.

839
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:04,283
You know he's Mr. Ko's
right-hand man, don't you?

840
00:54:05,534 --> 00:54:06,452
I do.

841
00:54:06,535 --> 00:54:09,329
Mr. Ha and Mr. Ko
are cut from a different cloth.

842
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:11,165
Mr. Ha is the shady type.

843
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:14,001
If he can't dig up any dirt,

844
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:15,419
he'll just make up some

845
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:17,212
in the dirtiest way possible.

846
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:18,922
The dirtiest way?

847
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:23,761
Like using hostesses, setting up affairs,
and offering sexual favors.

848
00:54:23,844 --> 00:54:26,180
He'll approach you in a similar way.

849
00:54:27,473 --> 00:54:28,849
That's all he knows.

850
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:32,019
Are you saying he'll send
a man to me or something?

851
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:33,312
It's possible.

852
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:36,565
You can't expect anything less.
That's where his standard lies.

853
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:39,359
When all you have is a hammer,
everything looks like a nail.

854
00:54:49,745 --> 00:54:53,540
COURT

855
00:54:53,824 --> 00:54:55,322
FINAL HEARING FOR THE MURDER CHARGE

856
00:54:55,464 --> 00:54:58,921
Your Honor, the defendant struck
the victim's head with a blunt weapon,

857
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:02,132
which constituted the initial act
that placed the victim in mortal danger.

858
00:55:02,216 --> 00:55:03,717
The Supreme Court has set the precedent

859
00:55:03,801 --> 00:55:06,386
that when a victim who has been beaten
and mistakenly presumed dead

860
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:08,263
dies from suffocation
after being buried alive,

861
00:55:08,347 --> 00:55:12,017
the entire course of action
amounts to one continuous act of homicide.

862
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:19,483
The precedent cited by the prosecution
is not materially applicable to this case.

863
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:23,111
In the precedent case,
the defendant mistakenly believed

864
00:55:23,195 --> 00:55:25,072
the victim had died
and proceeded to bury them,

865
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:27,741
and that act was
the direct cause of death.

866
00:55:27,825 --> 00:55:29,493
However, in the current case,

867
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:32,621
there was a separate and independent
intervention by the victim.

868
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:36,708
This breaks the continuity
of the acts as claimed by the prosecutor.

869
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:39,211
What exactly do you mean by

870
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:41,046
“independent intervention?"

871
00:55:41,672 --> 00:55:45,217
It refers to the victim's
habitual jaywalking.

872
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:52,391
The victim, Choi So-yun,
frequently violated traffic regulations.

873
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:56,603
Three months before her death,
she was hit by a car while jaywalking

874
00:55:56,687 --> 00:55:58,355
and received outpatient treatment.

875
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:02,317
She also had 12 traffic violations
on record over the past three years.

876
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:04,319
And, above all…

877
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:13,704
I SENT YOU SOME REFERENCE MATERIALS
HAVE A LOOK

878
00:56:16,248 --> 00:56:19,251
<i>In the upcoming trial,</i>
<i>the prosecutor will likely assert</i>

879
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:22,337
<i>that the blunt force attack</i>

880
00:56:22,421 --> 00:56:25,632
<i>and the vehicle impact constitute</i>
<i>one continuous course of conduct.</i>

881
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:27,384
<i>To refute this,</i>

882
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:29,720
<i>it must be proven that the causal link</i>

883
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:32,014
<i>between the act and the death was broken.</i>

884
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:37,102
<i>You need to prove an independent break</i>
<i>in the chain of causation</i>

885
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:39,855
<i>to disprove the prosecutor's case.</i>

886
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:44,067
<i>I almost hit Choi So-yun with my car</i>
<i>when she was in high school.</i>

887
00:56:45,027 --> 00:56:48,322
<i>I was driving through a green light</i>

888
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:51,533
<i>when Choi So-yun suddenly</i>
<i>walked into the middle of the street.</i>

889
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:54,578
<i>It was a four-lane street,</i>

890
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:57,247
<i>so it was extremely dangerous</i>
<i>for a pedestrian to cross.</i>

891
00:56:57,956 --> 00:56:59,791
<i>There was an overpass and an underpass,</i>

892
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:02,210
<i>but Choi So-yun opted to jaywalk.</i>

893
00:57:02,878 --> 00:57:05,005
<i>People don't change easily.</i>

894
00:57:06,715 --> 00:57:07,883
This is it.

895
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:11,511
Can you help me?

896
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:16,350
First, we need to get the security footage
from the accident site.

897
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:18,435
Maybe going back about six months?

898
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:20,646
I need to request
the preservation of evidence first.

899
00:57:21,647 --> 00:57:24,191
I'll also need
the victim's traffic violation records.

900
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:28,362
The assault took place near a bar

901
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:30,530
frequently visited by the victim.

902
00:57:30,614 --> 00:57:34,242
The parking lot for that bar is situated
on the opposite side of the street.

903
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:38,830
The accident occurred
on a six-lane, two-way street

904
00:57:38,914 --> 00:57:41,708
that was unsafe for pedestrians to cross,

905
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:44,461
yet the victim chose to jaywalk.

906
00:57:45,337 --> 00:57:48,006
Moreover, during the six months prior
to her death,

907
00:57:48,090 --> 00:57:51,343
the victim visited the bar 34 times

908
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:55,430
and crossed the road illegally
in the same manner on each occasion.

909
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:58,892
Autopsy findings indicated that the trauma

910
00:57:58,976 --> 00:58:01,728
from the blunt weapon led
to a non-lethal concussion,

911
00:58:01,812 --> 00:58:04,106
while the actual cause of death
was a cardiac rupture

912
00:58:04,189 --> 00:58:07,275
caused by chest compression
from the vehicle collision.

913
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:10,654
Are you saying my daughter is to blame

914
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:12,072
for her own death?

915
00:58:14,074 --> 00:58:16,243
Do you think it makes sense?

916
00:58:17,244 --> 00:58:18,370
Order in my court!

917
00:58:18,996 --> 00:58:21,957
One more outburst,
and you will be removed from this court.

918
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,000
I can't--

919
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:24,793
Myeong-suk, no.

920
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:26,586
Calm down.

921
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:27,629
Calm down.

922
00:58:28,964 --> 00:58:30,173
You have to calm down.

923
00:58:32,801 --> 00:58:34,594
To accept the prosecution's claim

924
00:58:34,678 --> 00:58:37,806
is to stretch the causal link
between the defendant's actions

925
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:40,809
and the victim's death
beyond reasonable bounds.

926
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:42,686
This case should not be treated as murder

927
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:46,356
but as two distinct
and independent events.

928
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:49,860
Injury caused by a blunt object
and death caused by a vehicle collision.

929
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:53,530
I will submit evidence
to support this claim.

930
00:58:59,453 --> 00:59:01,288
Prosecutor, proceed with the sentencing.

931
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:05,000
The prosecution requests

932
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:07,794
that the defendant
be sentenced to 25 years in prison.

933
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:10,714
Defense, present your closing statement.

934
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:19,931
Your Honor,

935
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:23,894
I speak today not only
as the defense attorney

936
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:26,146
but also as an individual

937
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:29,191
who sincerely acknowledges
the gravity of this matter.

938
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:30,650
The defendant, Kim Yeong-mi,

939
00:59:30,734 --> 00:59:34,237
was a victim
of severe school bullying in the past.

940
00:59:34,321 --> 00:59:35,655
And I was

941
00:59:35,739 --> 00:59:37,324
one of the bystanders

942
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:40,327
who turned a blind eye to that violence.

943
00:59:41,203 --> 00:59:43,121
What do you mean?

944
00:59:43,747 --> 00:59:45,040
I'd like to submit as evidence

945
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:47,042
a video recording from 12 years ago

946
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:49,294
showing the defendant
being subjected to school violence.

947
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:51,880
Your Honor, the source
of the video in question is unclear,

948
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:54,466
and it has no direct relevance
to the current case.

949
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:58,011
There's a high risk of further harm
to the victim and her family.

950
00:59:58,095 --> 00:59:59,096
That is correct.

951
00:59:59,888 --> 01:00:01,389
As the prosecution has stated,

952
01:00:01,473 --> 01:00:05,185
this video has no direct relevance
to the current case.

953
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:06,478
However,

954
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:09,689
this is a key piece of evidence
in determining the defendant's sentence

955
01:00:09,773 --> 01:00:12,359
because it demonstrates
how the defendant's suffering

956
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:15,320
from school bullying
has impacted her current mental state

957
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:18,406
and contributed to the offense.

958
01:00:19,407 --> 01:00:23,578
If the evidence is submitted
to assist the defendant's sentencing,

959
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:26,790
it may be admissible on a limited basis.

960
01:00:27,332 --> 01:00:29,084
I'll allow it.

961
01:00:30,127 --> 01:00:31,169
What?

962
01:00:31,253 --> 01:00:32,963
My daughter's dead.

963
01:00:33,672 --> 01:00:35,423
And you want to show
a bullying video now?

964
01:00:35,507 --> 01:00:38,218
Who cares about
stupid school violence videos!

965
01:00:39,427 --> 01:00:41,304
Order in my court!

966
01:00:41,388 --> 01:00:43,473
Do you seriously call yourself a judge?

967
01:00:45,392 --> 01:00:46,518
Why?

968
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:50,105
Why are you defending the murderer?

969
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:51,398
Bailiff, escort her out.

970
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:53,150
Get off me!

971
01:00:53,233 --> 01:00:55,152
Get off me!

972
01:00:55,235 --> 01:00:56,987
Let go of me!

973
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:58,697
I won't let you get away with this!

974
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:00,782
I swear I'll kill you all!

975
01:01:01,449 --> 01:01:03,368
Counsel, you may proceed.

976
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:06,246
Your Honor,

977
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:08,331
before the video is played,

978
01:01:08,415 --> 01:01:10,834
may the defendant be permitted
to wear an eye mask

979
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:13,837
and noise-canceling headphones
during the screening

980
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,464
to minimize potential distress
from trauma?

981
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:18,717
I'll allow it.

982
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:25,432
Would you like to cover your eyes
and listen to the music?

983
01:01:26,433 --> 01:01:27,642
Mr. Yoon.

984
01:01:52,292 --> 01:01:54,753
COURT IN SESSION

985
01:02:03,094 --> 01:02:05,305
<i>Time for a cigarette burn.</i>

986
01:02:08,433 --> 01:02:09,392
<i>You know</i>

987
01:02:09,476 --> 01:02:13,104
<i>you'll actually hurt your eyes</i>
<i>if you move, right?</i>

988
01:02:14,314 --> 01:02:15,440
<i>Here we go.</i>

989
01:02:24,658 --> 01:02:26,034
<i>My goodness.</i>

990
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:28,495
<i>Does it hurt?</i>

991
01:02:30,914 --> 01:02:32,958
I'd now like to show

992
01:02:33,041 --> 01:02:35,335
footage of the defendant
before the bullying began.

993
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:44,678
You may take off the mask.

994
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:13,581
One, two, three.

995
01:03:14,165 --> 01:03:16,251
- Sorry! Have fun cleaning!
- You're so dead!

996
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:21,506
The defendant, Kim Yeong-mi,

997
01:03:22,132 --> 01:03:24,009
was a bright and diligent student

998
01:03:24,092 --> 01:03:25,802
who consistently ranked first
in her school

999
01:03:25,885 --> 01:03:28,888
throughout middle school
and her first year of high school.

1000
01:03:28,972 --> 01:03:31,808
She was an ordinary girl
who laughed with her friends

1001
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:35,562
<i>and dreamed of the future.</i>

1002
01:03:37,605 --> 01:03:41,067
<i>Had it not been</i>
<i>for the cruel bullying she endured,</i>

1003
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:44,237
<i>she wouldn't be standing here today</i>
<i>as a defendant</i>

1004
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:47,324
and instead be out in the world

1005
01:03:47,407 --> 01:03:50,535
contributing to society
and realizing her full potential.

1006
01:03:51,953 --> 01:03:54,414
She even could have been sitting
in my seat,

1007
01:03:54,998 --> 01:03:59,294
or perhaps sitting beside Your Honor
as an associate judge.

1008
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:03,131
Your Honor,

1009
01:04:04,132 --> 01:04:05,800
the defendant's crime

1010
01:04:05,884 --> 01:04:08,178
must never be justified or forgiven,

1011
01:04:08,803 --> 01:04:11,473
and she must face
the punishment it rightfully deserves.

1012
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:15,185
But if this case is concluded
solely through punishment,

1013
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:18,313
we will have lost yet another life.

1014
01:04:19,105 --> 01:04:21,316
The law must serve not only to punish

1015
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:23,818
but also to offer new opportunities

1016
01:04:23,902 --> 01:04:26,613
through rehabilitation
and reintegration into society.

1017
01:04:27,238 --> 01:04:29,115
The crime committed by Kim Yeong-mi

1018
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:31,076
is not merely a personal tragedy

1019
01:04:31,159 --> 01:04:34,662
but the result of a societal failure
we chose to ignore.

1020
01:04:35,455 --> 01:04:37,332
Supporting her rehabilitation

1021
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:40,543
is more than an act
of personal redemption.

1022
01:04:40,627 --> 01:04:42,462
It's a way
for us to restore the compassion

1023
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:44,172
and responsibility we neglected

1024
01:04:44,255 --> 01:04:46,800
and a path toward
a more just and humane society.

1025
01:04:48,593 --> 01:04:50,011
I would like to submit a petition

1026
01:04:50,095 --> 01:04:53,473
written by 84 of the defendant's
high school classmates,

1027
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:55,100
bystanders like myself.

1028
01:04:59,312 --> 01:05:00,522
Your Honor,

1029
01:05:00,605 --> 01:05:02,399
I earnestly ask the court
to carefully consider

1030
01:05:02,482 --> 01:05:05,318
these materials and the petition

1031
01:05:05,402 --> 01:05:07,320
in determining the appropriate sentence.

1032
01:05:07,946 --> 01:05:11,491
Please allow Kim Yeong-mi the opportunity

1033
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:13,368
to start over and rebuild her life.

1034
01:05:16,371 --> 01:05:17,622
Defendant.

1035
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:22,085
You may make your final statement.

1036
01:05:31,302 --> 01:05:32,595
I admit my wrongdoing.

1037
01:05:34,055 --> 01:05:36,724
I truly regret my actions.

1038
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:42,105
I will humbly accept
the sentence I am given.

1039
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:04,544
The court will now deliver its verdict.

1040
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:07,922
The court

1041
01:06:08,006 --> 01:06:11,050
finds merit in the defense's claim
that there is a break

1042
01:06:11,134 --> 01:06:13,303
in the chain of causation

1043
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:17,599
between the defendant's assault
with a blunt weapon

1044
01:06:18,099 --> 01:06:19,434
and the victim's death.

1045
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:23,354
As such, the act of assault
and the vehicle collision are determined

1046
01:06:23,897 --> 01:06:25,773
to be unrelated and separate occurrences.

1047
01:06:26,733 --> 01:06:27,859
First,

1048
01:06:28,443 --> 01:06:29,611
the defendant

1049
01:06:29,694 --> 01:06:33,364
struck the victim with a blunt object
with the intent to cause bodily harm,

1050
01:06:33,448 --> 01:06:35,492
resulting in a concussion.

1051
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:39,704
Accordingly, the elements of the crime
of bodily injury are satisfied.

1052
01:06:39,787 --> 01:06:42,832
Second, with regard
to the vehicle accident,

1053
01:06:42,916 --> 01:06:46,503
the defendant failed
to properly maintain a lookout ahead,

1054
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:50,423
resulting in the victim's death.
This constitutes a charge of causing death

1055
01:06:50,507 --> 01:06:55,428
under the Special Act
on Traffic Accident Settlement.

1056
01:06:56,346 --> 01:06:59,432
For the two offenses, the court
hereby sentences the defendant

1057
01:07:00,308 --> 01:07:02,769
to two years of imprisonment.

1058
01:07:05,104 --> 01:07:07,565
That concludes the court's ruling.

1059
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:03,413
<i>What's all this?</i>

1060
01:08:04,038 --> 01:08:07,125
The bullying videos and photos found
on Choi So-yun's phone.

1061
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:10,044
You still had her phone?

1062
01:08:10,128 --> 01:08:11,129
Yes.

1063
01:08:13,256 --> 01:08:16,134
I never ended up giving it back to her.

1064
01:08:16,217 --> 01:08:17,510
It was in storage.

1065
01:08:18,261 --> 01:08:20,138
This will help with the sentencing.

1066
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:24,726
About what you said earlier…

1067
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:27,186
Mom, I was--

1068
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:30,773
If I could go back in time
with my current age, experience,

1069
01:08:30,857 --> 01:08:33,860
and everything I've learned,

1070
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:36,112
I might make a wiser choice.

1071
01:08:37,822 --> 01:08:39,157
But

1072
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:43,036
it was the best decision
I could make at that time,

1073
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:45,413
and I can't change that now.

1074
01:08:47,415 --> 01:08:48,291
Because

1075
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:51,961
at the heart of every decision I made

1076
01:08:52,879 --> 01:08:57,300
was my love for you, Hyo-min.

1077
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:00,970
As long as that love remains unchanged,

1078
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:06,476
I would make the same decision every time,
even if I could go back to the past.

1079
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:08,895
That's why I said
I don't regret my decisions.

1080
01:09:09,729 --> 01:09:10,938
But…

1081
01:09:13,733 --> 01:09:15,109
having heard what you said,

1082
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:18,696
I feel regret for the first time.

1083
01:09:42,595 --> 01:09:44,847
<i>I can take care of it.</i>
<i>Why are you butting in?</i>

1084
01:09:52,397 --> 01:09:53,981
- What are you doing?
- Oh, gosh.

1085
01:09:55,650 --> 01:09:56,943
Mr. Yoon.

1086
01:09:58,486 --> 01:10:00,780
I thought you guys
were having a get-together.

1087
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:03,116
Everyone is
at the fried chicken spot nearby.

1088
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:06,202
Is something wrong?

1089
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:13,126
It's just…

1090
01:10:14,168 --> 01:10:15,920
My head feels a bit heavy.

1091
01:10:19,132 --> 01:10:21,300
Why are you still here?

1092
01:10:21,384 --> 01:10:22,802
I have some work left.

1093
01:10:23,803 --> 01:10:26,013
I sometimes come up here to clear my head.

1094
01:10:27,974 --> 01:10:28,933
It's nice.

1095
01:10:29,559 --> 01:10:30,435
What is?

1096
01:10:31,102 --> 01:10:32,395
Just everything.

1097
01:10:32,478 --> 01:10:34,814
The view, the vibe,

1098
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:36,065
and

1099
01:10:37,275 --> 01:10:39,902
my unexpected encounter with you.

1100
01:10:40,445 --> 01:10:41,571
Everything.

1101
01:10:45,908 --> 01:10:47,034
Today's trial…

1102
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:51,831
was one of the most impressive
I've ever seen.

1103
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:54,167
Really?

1104
01:10:57,378 --> 01:11:01,632
They say people make
intuitive judgments first

1105
01:11:01,716 --> 01:11:04,302
and then come up
with logical reasons afterward.

1106
01:11:04,385 --> 01:11:06,471
That's why they say
intuition is a gift from God,

1107
01:11:06,554 --> 01:11:09,307
and reason is its faithful servant.

1108
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:13,102
Your argument was both intuitive
and technically well-supported,

1109
01:11:13,186 --> 01:11:16,773
presenting clear logical reasoning
to the judge.

1110
01:11:17,482 --> 01:11:20,485
It also maintained a good balance
between emotion and reason.

1111
01:11:20,568 --> 01:11:21,444
You did well.

1112
01:11:23,404 --> 01:11:25,364
You did well too.

1113
01:11:27,241 --> 01:11:28,576
What did I do well?

1114
01:11:30,453 --> 01:11:33,873
When you meet a client wanting
to heal their scars through a lawsuit,

1115
01:11:34,373 --> 01:11:35,792
you need to look beneath the scars.

1116
01:11:39,629 --> 01:11:42,298
Let go of your biases
and look at the essence.

1117
01:11:43,508 --> 01:11:45,134
To me,

1118
01:11:45,218 --> 01:11:47,553
justice means protecting the people
I have to protect.

1119
01:11:48,513 --> 01:11:50,973
Don't think like a small mind
trapped in dogma.

1120
01:11:51,766 --> 01:11:52,934
Try to see the bigger picture.

1121
01:11:53,017 --> 01:11:56,395
You're an awesome sculptor.

1122
01:11:56,938 --> 01:11:59,482
You patiently chip away at the rough edges

1123
01:11:59,565 --> 01:12:01,234
and shortcomings of the associates

1124
01:12:01,859 --> 01:12:04,737
and bring out potential
they didn't even know they had.

1125
01:12:06,072 --> 01:12:10,910
Of all your sculptures,
who is your greatest masterpiece?

1126
01:12:12,662 --> 01:12:13,913
Lee Jin-woo?

1127
01:12:16,707 --> 01:12:17,625
Kang Hyo-min?

1128
01:12:22,839 --> 01:12:24,340
You should smile more often.

1129
01:12:24,423 --> 01:12:25,925
There's no reason to hide your smile.

1130
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:27,677
I will.

1131
01:13:34,535 --> 01:13:37,413
BEYOND THE BAR

1132
01:13:37,496 --> 01:13:38,581
<i>What are you gonna do?</i>

1133
01:13:38,664 --> 01:13:41,083
<i>Let's begin by taking all actions</i>
<i>permitted under existing law.</i>

1134
01:13:41,192 --> 01:13:42,923
<i>- What's your deal, you bastard?</i>
<i>- Mr. Yoon.</i>

1135
01:13:43,753 --> 01:13:45,379
Mr. Yoon, pull yourself together.

1136
01:13:46,923 --> 01:13:48,215
I'm counting on you.

1137
01:13:48,299 --> 01:13:49,383
I'm so worried about him.

1138
01:13:49,467 --> 01:13:52,219
<i>- You still should've told me.</i>
<i>- Did you ever give me a chance?</i>

1139
01:13:52,303 --> 01:13:54,138
You should've made me understand you.

1140
01:13:54,221 --> 01:13:56,307
I was wondering if you had plans tomorrow.

1141
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:57,808
<i>- Hello.</i>
<i>- Let's go.</i>

1142
01:13:57,892 --> 01:14:01,187
<i>Mr. Ha Du-sik is backed</i>
<i>by Mr. Ko Seung-cheol.</i>

1143
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:02,563
<i>He won't just stand by and watch.</i>

1144
01:14:02,647 --> 01:14:04,440
<i>They've filed a lawsuit</i>
<i>against Bluestone Fund.</i>

1145
01:14:04,523 --> 01:14:06,192
You'll get your company back.

1146
01:14:08,069 --> 01:14:10,069
