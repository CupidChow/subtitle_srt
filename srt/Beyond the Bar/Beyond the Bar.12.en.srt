1
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:35,953
BEYOND THE BAR

2
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:45,504
Goodness.

3
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:40,183
YOU GOT THIS!

4
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:46,565
Yes?

5
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,738
Mr. Yoon,

6
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,698
Ms. Seol is here.

7
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:02,247
Hash is tough,

8
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:04,750
and he's already recovered
so much in just a day.

9
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,668
I said I'd pick him up.

10
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:08,670
I was heading downtown anyway.

11
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:11,173
I'll go pick him up for the time being.

12
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,091
Don't leave him at the hotel.

13
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:14,259
It's far.

14
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:16,303
Wouldn't it be easier to use the hotel?

15
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:17,262
It's not far.

16
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:20,223
Okay.

17
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:22,517
Do what you want.

18
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,355
About what I said yesterday…

19
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,191
Let's not talk about that anymore.

20
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,109
I don't want to talk about something

21
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,153
so pointless.

22
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,447
I understand.

23
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,618
I've given it a lot of thought.

24
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:43,914
I think it'd be better

25
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:45,874
if you took care of Hash.

26
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:50,712
Are you sure?

27
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,215
Under one condition.

28
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:55,509
What is it?

29
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,679
Whether it's a roommate

30
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:00,681
or a wife,

31
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:03,016
I want you to find someone
to raise Hash with.

32
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,142
Then you can have custody.

33
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:05,394
What do you say?

34
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:07,813
Deal.

35
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:15,237
<i>Heart Logic</i>

36
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,031
doesn't rely on manual matching
like traditional matchmaking companies.

37
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:20,033
We use AI to analyze the info you enter

38
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:22,536
about your ideal type
and match you automatically.

39
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,746
We turn your preferences into data

40
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,499
and recommend the ideal matches for you.

41
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:31,336
Another unique feature is that you meet
without seeing photos or profiles.

42
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,755
It's literally a blind date,
just as the term suggests.

43
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,757
<i>People meet without photos or profiles?</i>

44
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:37,759
Yes. In fact,
the success rate is much higher

45
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:39,553
when you meet
without having any information.

46
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,430
And we don't limit the number of dates

47
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:43,932
like traditional matchmaking companies do,

48
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,976
so you can meet your matches
with no pressure.

49
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,644
As long as your schedule allows,

50
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,438
you can get unlimited matches for a year.

51
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:50,689
Would you like to--

52
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,899
Mommy, I need to pee.

53
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:54,025
Go find Dad.

54
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:55,861
<i>- I see.</i>
- Yes.

55
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,446
<i>You do verify your members, right?</i>

56
00:03:57,529 --> 00:03:58,739
Of course!

57
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:01,616
We conduct rigorous manual verification.

58
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,167
LOVE YOU, MOM AND DAD

59
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,133
I'll get going.

60
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,969
I'm just having one face-to-face meeting
and heading straight back home.

61
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:23,305
Really? Then can you pick up Min
on your way back?

62
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,765
Why?

63
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:27,225
I'll probably have dinner with Sang-min.

64
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:29,186
Is that so?

65
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,606
I was thinking the three of us
could have a family dinner.

66
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,608
- Let's do that tomorrow.
- Okay.

67
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,986
Are you still in the talking stage,

68
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,906
or are things moving forward?

69
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:43,241
I don't want to discuss my dating life.

70
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:46,870
It's weird. After all,
you're my legal husband.

71
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,122
Okay. I'm off.

72
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:50,457
Bye.

73
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,785
I'm home.

74
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,745
Where were you?

75
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:31,414
Min said you went
to take out the recycling.

76
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,291
Where's Min? Is he asleep?

77
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,251
Yes.

78
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,128
Have you been drinking?

79
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:39,214
Yes, a little.

80
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:47,597
So,

81
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,600
about our living arrangement…

82
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,270
Are you sure this is okay?

83
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:55,438
What's going on?

84
00:05:58,483 --> 00:05:59,359
I…

85
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:01,403
I think…

86
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,031
I have feelings for you.

87
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:09,703
When I think about you with another man,

88
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,080
I get jealous,

89
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:13,915
and I can feel

90
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,376
something hot

91
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:18,879
- boiling up in here.
- Min-chan.

92
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:22,883
This is a breach of contract.

93
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:24,843
Our co-parenting agreement

94
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:28,179
has no real meaning in Korea.

95
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:30,098
What are you saying?

96
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:32,142
Are you sure we're doing the right thing?

97
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,687
Do you think we are truly

98
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:38,398
happy in this loveless family?

99
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,110
Love is a feeling
that can change over time.

100
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:44,070
A family built on nothing but that feeling

101
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:47,282
will eventually make you miserable,
and it will end in divorce.

102
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:48,450
I don't want

103
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,202
to raise Min in a divorced family.

104
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:56,458
I think…

105
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,420
I really love you.

106
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,134
I'm sorry.

107
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:08,595
I don't want…

108
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,222
to break our family apart.

109
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,230
Okay.

110
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,070
In that case,

111
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,155
we should get divorced.

112
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:29,699
I'm really sorry,

113
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:33,745
but I don't want to live
in a loveless family.

114
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:38,416
I want us to be a real couple.

115
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:49,469
BEYOND LOVE'S VOW

116
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:51,680
A breach of contract?

117
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,682
What kind of breach of contract?

118
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:55,600
Co-parenting agreement.

119
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:59,437
We agreed to raise our child together
without a marital relationship.

120
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:01,856
I'm not sure if I'm following.

121
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,026
Min-chan and I got married without love.

122
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:08,738
We believed that such a marriage
would be more stable,

123
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:12,617
so we agreed to have a child through IVF
and not interfere in each other's lives.

124
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:16,371
So, there was no physical relationship
with your husband?

125
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,289
No. Not even once.

126
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,754
I met Min-chan in the US,

127
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,506
where I found people like us

128
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:29,300
who believed that love
can actually ruin a marriage.

129
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,553
There was an online platform
that connected such people,

130
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,221
and that's where I met him.

131
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,224
I see.

132
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,730
Both Min-chan and I grew up

133
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:44,524
in divorced families.

134
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,317
So, having experienced firsthand

135
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:49,029
how unstable a marriage
based on love can be,

136
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:50,321
we joined the platform.

137
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,575
In the US, depending on the state,

138
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:56,077
contracts like this
may be recognized legally.

139
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:57,454
The chances of such a contract

140
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:01,082
being recognized
by a Korean court seem low.

141
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:04,335
If it's determined that such a contract
goes against public order and morals,

142
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:06,254
it can be declared void.

143
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,549
What do you mean by that exactly?

144
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:13,178
It refers to the basic moral values
and public order of society.

145
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:16,056
For example, a "concubine contract"
that went against the monogamy system

146
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,768
was ruled void
for violating public order and morals.

147
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:21,227
A "concubine"?

148
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:22,771
Yes.

149
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:24,939
Another case involving a contract

150
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:28,276
in which a married person agreed to marry
a specific person after divorcing

151
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:32,447
was declared void
for violating ethics and social order.

152
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,200
But my contract with him
isn't anything weird like that.

153
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:38,661
Taking on a concubine
or agreeing to marry someone else

154
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,371
is in itself against basic human ethics.

155
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:43,208
But we simply found ourselves
a better form of marriage,

156
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,877
one that doesn't rely
on imperfect emotions.

157
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,295
I understand.

158
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,131
But from the court's perspective,

159
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:51,966
it could be seen as fundamentally denying

160
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,594
the traditional concept of marriage

161
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:57,722
since sexual union
and emotional bonds are regarded

162
00:09:57,806 --> 00:10:00,016
as essential to a marital relationship.

163
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,392
I see.

164
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:05,105
But why do you see it
as a breach of contract?

165
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:07,565
My husband ended up
falling in love with me.

166
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,568
He wants us to be
like other married couples.

167
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:11,903
And I'm not interested.

168
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:13,988
Now, he wants to divorce me.

169
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:16,449
But I don't want to get divorced.

170
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:18,535
I like how things are now,

171
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:20,787
just as we agreed in the contract.

172
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:33,341
<i>Whether it's a roommate</i>

173
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:34,801
or a wife,

174
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,970
I want you to find someone
to raise Hash with.

175
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,429
Then you can have custody.

00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:19,679
Yes, I am.

186
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:23,850
It operates in a more progressive way
than traditional ones.

187
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,519
This is my agency's brochure. Have a read.

188
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:30,106
It might be a bit soon
to think about getting married,

189
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,025
but if you're going to,
now's the right time.

190
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,027
I got Min-ji to sign up too.

191
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,486
She told me.

192
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,823
We have a discount for acquaintances.

193
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:39,991
Okay.

194
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,286
It's rather ironic

195
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:47,040
that someone who doesn't believe in love
is in the matchmaking business.

196
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,499
That's why I can run the business.

197
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,002
Love is about feelings,
but marriage is about reality.

198
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:53,713
It's not a promise to love forever.

199
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:56,758
It's simply a lifetime contract
to live together.

200
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,801
Compatibility is more important
than feelings

201
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,720
when it comes to spending life together.

202
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,597
Introductions through friends are limited.

203
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,308
It's not easy
to find a good match by chance.

204
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:07,560
In a matchmaking agency,

205
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,771
you have access to a much larger pool,

206
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,439
so the odds are in your favor.

207
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:15,526
- I look forward to working with you.
- I do too.

208
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,323
<i>Give me a break.</i>

209
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,283
How can she have a child
without being intimate?

210
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:23,576
Who is she, the Virgin Mary?

211
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,953
Through IVF.

212
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:27,705
That thing for infertile couples?

213
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,208
It's not exclusively for that these days.

214
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:33,294
So you're saying the husband
wants to divorce his wife because…

215
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:36,130
Because he ended up
falling in love with his wife.

216
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:37,715
Isn't it just weird?

217
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:40,009
He wants to divorce her
because he loves her?

218
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,179
What is it that the client wants?

219
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:46,891
She wants to legally enforce
the co-parenting agreement.

220
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,102
She also wants to claim
the one billion won penalty

221
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,895
specified in the contract.

222
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,565
The purpose of that
isn't so much to get compensation

223
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:56,192
as it is to use it as leverage

224
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,903
to avoid divorce
and keep living as they are now.

225
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:02,240
But will judges actually
see that as a valid contract?

226
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,825
I told her it could be void

227
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,077
if it's deemed
to be against public order and morals.

228
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,662
It's pissing me off.

229
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:09,247
What is?

230
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,373
You see,

231
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,583
she's violating
the sacred marriage system.

232
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:16,921
Don't project your emotions
onto it too much.

233
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:18,214
Did I?

234
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:21,175
These days, a lot of married couples
have affairs and sexless marriages.

235
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:23,136
Couples that are just for show.

236
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:26,639
But these people left emotions out
from the start by contract.

237
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:28,975
Couples that are just for show
keep it hidden.

238
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,352
They're basically the same.
Marriages without love.

239
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:32,687
No.

240
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,230
They must have been in love at first,

241
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,940
so it's a marriage where love has faded.

242
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:38,318
Maybe marriage isn't
the culmination of love

243
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:40,611
but the process of exhausting it.

244
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:41,904
Look at you people.

245
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:44,657
Why are you so negative about marriage?

246
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:47,035
I'm not saying what I think.

247
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:49,203
I'm just saying how it is these days.

248
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:53,082
People half-jokingly say
marriage should be renewed every 20 years.

249
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:57,170
When marriage became an institution,
people would only live to about 50 or 60.

250
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,921
People live up to 100 these days,

251
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,382
so the idea of loving
only one person for life

252
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:03,384
can seem a bit unrealistic.

253
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,470
If anything, having an expiration date

254
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:06,846
might make people try harder--

255
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,097
Whatever.

256
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:12,518
I don't care how other people live
or what they think.

257
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:15,438
I just want to marry
someone I love deeply,

258
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,856
shower her with love forever,

259
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,025
and even when I'm old,
I'd use all my energy to--

260
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,236
Okay. That's enough.

261
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,908
What do you think, Mr. Yoon?

262
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,451
Does it make sense to get married

263
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,536
solely for the purpose
of having and raising a child

264
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,954
without intimacy or affection?

265
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,874
Some people even consider marriage
just so they can have a dog.

266
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,252
Sorry?

267
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,381
You see,

268
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:42,882
love is a feeling,

269
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,051
and feelings can change at any time.

270
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,929
On the other hand,

271
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:50,640
marriage is essentially
a fixed lifelong contract,

272
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,308
so the two won't always coincide.

273
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:57,230
So I can see why someone
would choose to build a family

274
00:14:57,313 --> 00:15:00,191
based on the responsibility
of co-parenting,

275
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:04,278
instead of relying
on the uncertainty of emotions.

276
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:07,198
That's unexpected, coming from a romantic.

277
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,408
A romantic?

278
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,910
Mr. Yoon?

279
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:13,704
- Not anymore, apparently.
- No.

280
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,253
Anyway, I want to take this case.

281
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:23,381
Public order and morals
are not fixed concepts.

282
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,425
They can be understood differently

283
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:27,343
depending on the era and social norms.

284
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,220
I also believe that marriage

285
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,931
should now be viewed in more diverse ways.

286
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,349
Can I take this case?

287
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:34,809
Yes.

288
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,102
I'll join her.

289
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,105
- Go ahead.
- Good grief.

290
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,575
Tell me if you feel any pain.

291
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:51,534
Okay.

292
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,332
I thought it would hurt, but it doesn't.

293
00:15:58,416 --> 00:15:59,500
Right?

294
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:03,296
This is the most popular treatment
these days.

295
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:07,216
You'll see the improvement
if you get the treatment regularly.

296
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,260
Okay, thanks.

297
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,846
- I'm so glad.
- I'll introduce them.

298
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:19,145
Ms. Heo Min-jeong, over here!

299
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,317
- Hello.
- Hi.

300
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,444
This is my friend, Lee Gyeong-hui.

301
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,571
She's Jin-woo's big sister.

302
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,575
How do you do?

303
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,368
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

304
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:37,455
You're the reason
I got a fresh start in life.

305
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:42,168
So, for winning the case, I figured
I'd treat you and invite Gyeong-hui

306
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,629
since she's the one
who referred you to me.

307
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:45,922
That's great.

308
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,006
Please.

309
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:54,639
So, you and Jin-woo work on the same team?

310
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:57,058
Yes, we started at the same time,
so we get along well.

311
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,726
I see.

312
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:02,647
Then you must be around the same age.

313
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,940
Same age, apparently.

314
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,233
As Jin-woo?

315
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:06,317
No.

316
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,819
- As us.
- Are you for real?

317
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:11,239
- You're 42?
- Yes.

318
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,325
You must take
really good care of yourself.

319
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:18,663
I thought you and Jin-woo
were only a year or two apart.

320
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,414
But a ten-year gap?

321
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:23,834
How do you have zero age spots?

322
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:27,088
Your complexion is amazing.

323
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,757
It's because I went
to the dermatologist yesterday.

324
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,175
Really?

325
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:33,177
That's why you were glowing!

326
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:35,012
What did you get done?

327
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:36,931
I had a treatment for my age spots.

328
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:39,433
They definitely look lighter now,

329
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:41,561
and my skin texture seems better too.

330
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:47,775
With that ten-year gap,

331
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,903
Jin-woo must seem like a baby to you.

332
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:54,365
No, not particularly.

333
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:57,034
He's only a baby to you.

334
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:58,869
Jin-woo is 32 now.

335
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:00,788
- I know.
- Yes.

336
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,834
It's about time he got married,

337
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,086
but there hasn't been any news at all.

338
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,713
Doesn't he have a girlfriend?

339
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:09,964
I don't think so.

340
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:14,010
Does he?

341
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:15,928
Well,

342
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:19,390
I'm not so sure.

343
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:20,391
Ms. Heo.

344
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,020
Please take care of my brother

345
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,104
like a big sister.

346
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,982
If you know anyone nice,
you could introduce…

347
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,528
I guess everyone you know
must be older than him.

348
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:34,697
They are, right?

349
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,241
I guess so.

350
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:39,160
Why can't he meet someone older?

351
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,995
Are you serious?

352
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,456
Jin-woo doesn't like older women.
I don't, either.

353
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,082
My family wouldn't approve.

354
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:47,918
A gap of a couple years is fine.

355
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:50,880
No way. They need to have a baby.

356
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,966
- Right, a baby.
- Yes.

357
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,177
- This is good.
- This place is famous.

358
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,136
Enjoy, Ms. Heo.

359
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,179
Thanks.

360
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,737
What's up?

361
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:22,995
About our dinner…

362
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,623
- Yeah?
- I forgot I had plans.

363
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:26,791
What plans?

364
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,543
Just some plans.

365
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:31,545
Let's have dinner another time.

366
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,846
What's her deal?

367
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:48,813
Hey, Gyeong-hui.

368
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:50,231
Yes.

369
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:52,692
When?

370
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,527
With Ms. Heo?

371
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:03,828
Let's talk for a second.

372
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,627
You really have plans this evening?

373
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,629
Yes.

374
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:14,588
Don't lie.

375
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:18,175
Why didn't you tell me
you met my eldest sister?

376
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,431
What did she say
to make you avoid me again?

377
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:26,392
She didn't say much.

378
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:30,521
We both know what it's about.

379
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,357
I tried to ignore it, but I can't.

380
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:37,445
Okay. You're ten years older than me.

381
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:39,280
You're divorced and have a kid.

382
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,032
But I still love you.

383
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:45,286
Are you going to play hide-and-seek
every time this comes up?

384
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,123
If you start dating now,
marriage comes next.

385
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:50,875
But are we even compatible?

386
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,710
You can date
without checking all the boxes,

387
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,503
- but marriage is different.
- Checking boxes?

388
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:55,713
Look.

389
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:58,507
Marriage is something you do
when you're crazy in love.

390
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:00,426
What determines a good match or a bad one?

391
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,636
Isn't love what really matters
in marriage?

392
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,556
Jeez.

393
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:09,435
Marry me.

394
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:11,020
What?

395
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:14,315
Let's get our families' blessing
and get married.

396
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,402
I bet your family will be over the moon.

397
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:21,572
So what if they're not?
You'll be living with me, not them.

398
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:25,493
Listen carefully.

399
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:29,955
I'm done sidelining myself for love.

400
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:33,501
I love you, but I'm more important to me.

401
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:36,545
I love myself more than you.

402
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,716
It's the only way I can ever repay my mom.

403
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:47,473
What?

404
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:50,309
What did you just say?

405
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:53,521
- Say what?
- Say what you just said.

406
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:55,439
I love myself more.

407
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:57,608
No, right before that.

408
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,903
I love you, but I'm…

409
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,158
You can't just drop that on me.

410
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:07,117
I'm all shaken up.

411
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,538
Trust me.

412
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:14,124
I'll never let you feel less than you are.

413
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:15,918
Never.

414
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:28,013
Where's Ms. Kwon?

415
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:29,682
She's out for a while.

416
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:34,603
I was going to give you a call.

417
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:35,563
About what?

418
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:39,316
I got a call from Ban Gi-seung.

419
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:47,616
Just as we suspected,

420
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,119
Mr. Ko orchestrated the whole thing.

421
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,537
I knew it.

422
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,831
Now we just need to find the evidence.

423
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:55,082
Yes.

424
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:57,167
He's agreed to hand over
all the key evidence.

425
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:59,587
Did they seem to be on bad terms?

426
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:00,796
Of course they are.

427
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,506
That's why he came to me.

428
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:06,218
From Ban Gi-seung's standpoint,

429
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:09,722
if he admits that Mr. Ko
orchestrated everything,

430
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,391
he'll lose his license
for breaching the OEM rules.

431
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:16,186
If he says the asset management company
handled everything independently,

432
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,981
he'll be on the hook
for over 80 billion won in damages.

433
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,191
Either way, it's a dead end.

434
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:24,194
On top of that, I hear Mr. Ko

435
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,239
is trying to pin everything
on Ban Gi-seung.

436
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,370
LEE JIN-WOO

437
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:37,291
<i>The organization that supported Mr. Ban</i>

438
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:40,294
<i>is the Seunghun Foundation,</i>
<i>operated by Mr. Ko Seung-cheol.</i>

439
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:46,383
Did you give our information to him?

440
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:49,219
He asked me where I hid
the technical documents,

441
00:23:49,303 --> 00:23:50,679
so I said there's no such thing

442
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:53,432
and that it's all
in Mr. Lee Seong-bin's head.

443
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:59,772
- Why?
- It doesn't seem like Mr. Ban

444
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:01,982
would betray Mr. Ko.

445
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:05,569
What if Mr. Ko sent him
to see what we're up to?

446
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,072
Why do you think that?

447
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:11,909
He got backing from Mr. Ko's foundation.

448
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:13,077
He did?

449
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:16,789
Then Mr. Ban would also be
one of Mr. Ko's protégés.

450
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:17,831
Mr. Ko's protégés?

451
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:18,916
Yes.

452
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,543
Law firms are all about people,

453
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:23,671
and Mr. Ko has got that down to an art.

454
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:26,423
He used his persuasion skills
to run another venture built on people.

455
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:29,259
He nurtured talent
through corporate and client sponsorships

456
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:31,929
and built networks
to strengthen his client base.

457
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:35,265
He has a knack for developing people
and reaping the benefits.

458
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:38,435
Mr. Ban Gi-seung is probably
one of them too.

459
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:40,938
Ko Seung-cheol's protégés.

460
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:43,565
Still,

461
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:46,777
if his life's on the line,
he'll want to find a way out.

462
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:50,823
They're handing over

463
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:54,284
all the evidence at four o'clock
the day after tomorrow.

464
00:24:54,368 --> 00:24:56,620
We'll know the truth then.

465
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:58,330
Yes.

466
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:04,128
- Take it easy.
- You too.

467
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:17,850
Can we get a drink after work?

468
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:20,269
Is something wrong?

469
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:23,147
This is about
the most important thing in my life.

470
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:25,315
I need you to hear me out.

471
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:27,484
- Okay.
- Can Hyo-min join us?

472
00:25:27,568 --> 00:25:28,861
Why her?

473
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:31,530
I'm not sure if she'll be any help,

474
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:33,991
but I need someone
with a female perspective.

475
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:34,950
Okay.

476
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,077
Thanks.

477
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:51,842
I'm dating Min-jeong.

478
00:25:53,844 --> 00:25:54,845
I knew it.

479
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:57,931
Since lunch the other day,
you were acting weird.

480
00:25:58,015 --> 00:25:59,349
You're not even surprised.

481
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,269
Anyway, I want to get married.

482
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:05,064
- With whom?
- With whom?

483
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:07,274
I just told you.

484
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:09,610
I'm dating Min-jeong.
Who else could it be?

485
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,111
Why are you so surprised?

486
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:12,863
Things are moving too fast.

487
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:14,698
Exactly. Very fast.

488
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:16,742
- And?
- And?

489
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:17,701
Jeez.

490
00:26:17,785 --> 00:26:18,911
What are you, his echo?

491
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:20,370
Out with it.

492
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:22,081
You want to marry her, and what?

493
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:28,796
I'm thinking about popping the question,

494
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:32,299
but she sounded like
she's not big on marriage.

495
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:35,928
So I figured I'd get your advice

496
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:37,638
on how to pop the question.

497
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:40,099
Nothing beats the classics.

498
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:43,477
How about reciting
your personally written vows of love?

499
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:47,689
Very simple,
yet very intuitive. I love it.

500
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:48,816
So, what should I write?

501
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:52,236
I'd love to help you out,

502
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,196
but I have no idea.

503
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,781
I'm not even sure

504
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:58,283
if marriage and love go together.

505
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:00,244
You're not helping me at all.

506
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:01,370
How about you?

507
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:03,413
Me?

508
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:10,838
I think…

509
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:14,466
marriage is built on love.

510
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:19,304
Over time, that love just changes shape.

511
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:21,306
How so?

512
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,767
Love between a couple

513
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:27,229
starts with passion, goes through reality,

514
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:30,107
and ends in solidarity.

515
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,984
Losing passion

516
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,987
doesn't mean losing love.

517
00:27:36,697 --> 00:27:39,199
Solidarity, loyalty, belonging.

518
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:42,286
They're all just different forms of love.

519
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,418
I've got an answer.

520
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,836
Wait.

521
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,172
Can I use that for my vows?

522
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:54,506
Let me borrow your words.

523
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:56,091
What did you say?

524
00:27:57,676 --> 00:28:00,137
"Love starts with passion."

525
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,555
"Goes through reality."

526
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:03,348
I know.

527
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:05,058
"Goes through reality."

528
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:08,103
"And ends in solidarity."

529
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:12,232
- Just one more round.
- One more round.

530
00:28:12,983 --> 00:28:14,651
- One more round!
- One more round!

531
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:16,945
You two can go ahead.

532
00:28:23,744 --> 00:28:25,746
Just one more, then.

533
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,372
- Yes!
- Yes!

534
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,417
You're just chugging it.

535
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,170
- Excuse me!
- Yes.

536
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:34,630
- One more soju, please!
- Sure.

537
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:36,506
Thanks.

538
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:40,177
Cheers! Thank you.

539
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:46,225
You can do it, Jin-woo!

540
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:48,769
Go, future groom!

541
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:35,274
COURT

542
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:46,576
If they say this,
we have to bring this up.

543
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,744
Okay?

544
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,081
Here they are.

545
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,544
Long time no see, Ms. Kang.

546
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:58,088
You've got yourself an interesting case.

547
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:13,270
Why can't the plaintiff ask for a divorce?

548
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:15,564
The plaintiff seeks a divorce,

549
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:18,025
claiming that the defendant
had feelings for someone else.

550
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:20,944
However, according
to Article 841 of the Civil Act,

551
00:30:21,028 --> 00:30:23,030
a divorce cannot be filed

552
00:30:23,113 --> 00:30:25,365
if the other party's misconduct
occurred with prior consent

553
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:27,326
or if it was forgiven after the fact.

554
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:30,954
In this case, the plaintiff and defendant
agreed at the time of their marriage

555
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:33,248
to have no emotional or physical ties,

556
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:35,083
to allow separate romantic relationships,

557
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:38,378
and to only share child-rearing duties.

558
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:42,466
This constitutes prior consent
under Article 841 of the Civil Act.

559
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:45,177
So if someone gives prior consent
for an affair,

560
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,137
or if they forgive an affair
after the fact,

561
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,139
they can't file for divorce over it?

562
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,475
- No.
- Right.

563
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:53,185
She's good.

564
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:54,936
That's what Hyo-min is using here.

565
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,064
The plaintiff is not only claiming

566
00:30:57,147 --> 00:31:00,067
that the defendant
had a fling with another man

567
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:03,945
but also that he can no longer endure
a loveless, sexless marriage.

568
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:06,490
Even if there had been prior consent,

569
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:08,909
it has now been clearly withdrawn.

570
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:11,495
Do you not understand
the meaning of a contract?

571
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:14,247
Does a contract become null and void
if it's retracted unilaterally?

572
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:15,916
A contract?

573
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:17,959
Yes, that contract is void.

574
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:21,338
From day one, that deal
excluded love and intimacy

575
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:23,673
and even allowed them to date others.

576
00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:25,467
It denies the essence of marriage.

577
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,095
That contract goes against
public order and morals. It's void.

578
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:31,014
In short, a loveless,
sexless marriage itself is a violation

579
00:31:31,098 --> 00:31:32,140
of public order and morals.

580
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:35,685
If a loveless marriage is a violation
of public order and morals,

581
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:39,106
does that invalidate any marriage
based solely on practical conditions?

582
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:41,733
By that logic, couples
whose love has faded or who are sexless

583
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:43,735
should all get divorced.

584
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:47,239
A marriage is not only
a union where a couple's feelings align.

585
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:49,866
The couple also shares
intentions and life purposes.

586
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:52,411
The plaintiff and the defendant
made this agreement

587
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:53,829
for the purpose of child-rearing,

588
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:56,415
and they have successfully maintained
their family without issues.

589
00:31:56,498 --> 00:32:00,877
However, the plaintiff now seeks
to break up this stable household,

590
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:03,046
citing nothing more than
a change of feelings.

591
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,132
Your Honor,

592
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:08,510
this agreement directly denies
the marital obligations

593
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,846
of cohabitation, support, and cooperation

594
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,889
stipulated in Article 826
of the Civil Act.

595
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:14,558
Should the court allow this,

596
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:16,518
it may result in significant confusion

597
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:19,312
in the legal system governing
spousal relations under the Civil Act.

598
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:21,064
Furthermore, the Supreme Court holds

599
00:32:21,148 --> 00:32:23,442
that sexual relations
are essential to marriage,

600
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:28,029
and a prolonged refusal without cause
can be grounds for divorce.

601
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:31,199
If the defendant wants to keep
this marriage so desperately,

602
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:32,701
she could sleep with the plaintiff.

603
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:36,538
Are you telling her to sleep with a man
she doesn't even love?

604
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,248
So why get married

605
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:41,084
when you don't even love the guy?

606
00:32:41,168 --> 00:32:44,463
Because love is an imperfect,
exhaustible, and temporary emotion.

607
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:46,882
That's why not everyone who's in love
gets married

608
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,468
and not everyone
who gets married is in love.

609
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:51,136
You know that better than anyone.

610
00:32:58,143 --> 00:33:00,187
Your Honor,

611
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:04,483
the case cited by the plaintiff's counsel
is only a standard for a typical marriage

612
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:07,444
and cannot be applied
when there was a clear agreement

613
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,237
before marriage
not to have sexual relations.

614
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:11,031
Okay, then. Let me ask you this.

615
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,658
Put all the feelings and sex aside.

616
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:15,368
Are you saying you want the court

617
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:17,829
to permit a married woman
to see another man?

618
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,832
Hang on. I find this very offensive.

619
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:24,085
You seem to think our contract violates
public order and morals or whatever.

620
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:25,921
What was it that I heard?

621
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,465
A concubine contract?
I heard this applies to things like that.

622
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:32,677
The contract we made
was not immoral or abnormal.

623
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:37,682
He knows it better than anyone.
He's using his lawyer as his mouthpiece.

624
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:40,769
I won't see Sang-min anymore.

625
00:33:42,062 --> 00:33:43,104
Would that do?

626
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:45,273
Defendant,

627
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:46,399
please calm down.

628
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:49,027
Your Honor,

629
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:51,363
there wouldn't be an issue

630
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:54,783
if we remove the contract's
open relationship clause, right?

631
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:57,285
Wouldn't it be
a severely outdated judgment

632
00:33:57,369 --> 00:34:01,748
to say that this contract is void solely
because it's a loveless, sexless marriage?

633
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:04,251
Regarding that matter,

634
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:06,795
the court will make
a comprehensive judgment.

635
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:09,923
Your Honor,

636
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:13,009
this contract is based
on sexual self-determination

637
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:15,762
and social responsibility
towards child-rearing

638
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:18,098
and does not violate public order.

639
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:21,893
The institution of marriage evolves
with time and alongside culture.

640
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:26,022
Two people from divorced families
entered this contract

641
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:29,067
to provide a better environment
for their child.

642
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,987
Clear rules were necessary to ensure

643
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,406
predictability in child-rearing
and daily life.

644
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,746
I understand.

645
00:34:42,372 --> 00:34:44,958
The court will carefully determine
whether this contract represents

646
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:48,837
an evolved form of marriage
or a structure that undermines

647
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:50,672
the institution itself.

648
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:54,551
The law represents
the minimum threshold of morality.

649
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:57,929
In reviewing this case,
we will consider the nature of marriage

650
00:34:58,013 --> 00:34:59,764
and the principle
of public order and morals.

651
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:02,392
File any additional submissions
by the deadline,

652
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:05,020
and we'll set the next hearing date.

653
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,526
Let's talk for a minute.

654
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:17,365
About what?

655
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:19,618
I go on blind dates every week.

656
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:21,077
Sometimes three times a week.

657
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:22,245
So?

658
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,040
Every time I meet someone,
I regret what I did.

659
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:25,999
And I wonder

660
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,585
why I did that to you.

661
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:33,214
I meant everything
I said in court earlier.

662
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:35,258
A marriage without love doesn't work.

663
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:37,010
Even if I find someone
who's a better match,

664
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:39,012
what's the point if I don't love them?

665
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:41,222
You're not right for me.

666
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:42,182
Why not?

667
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:44,517
I'll be better.

668
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:48,480
Forget love. You're not loyal.

669
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:52,734
I wouldn't date someone like that,
let alone marry them.

670
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:10,752
It's been 20 minutes. Where is he?

671
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,212
I'll give him a call.

672
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:16,091
HYNIC CORE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CHOI CHIL-HYEON

673
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,760
What is Mr. Choi from Hynic Core
calling me for?

674
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:22,055
- Who's that?
- The head of technology.

675
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,306
Go ahead.

676
00:36:25,225 --> 00:36:26,101
Hello.

677
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:29,145
Yes.

678
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,690
What? Now?

679
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:39,739
You can sign
in the designated space at the bottom.

680
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:41,658
The moment you sign,

681
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:44,285
20 billion won will be transferred
immediately to your account.

682
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:46,830
This offer is valid until 6 p.m. today.

683
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,501
You have 18 minutes left.

684
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:57,757
This is the only way.

685
00:36:57,841 --> 00:37:00,844
With 20 billion won,
we can clear not only your debt

686
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:04,472
but also Sang-jun's, Geon-taek's,
and Seung-nam's.

687
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:06,099
You can't let your family

688
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:08,643
lose their home and end up on the streets.

689
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:12,147
We trusted you and even brought in
loan shark money for the research.

690
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:14,274
If Hynic Core cuts us loose too,

691
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,735
we're done for.

692
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,701
Are you sure if I just sign,

693
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:28,538
the plan to lay off Hynic Core employees
will be withdrawn?

694
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:30,749
Yes.

695
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:33,418
You already checked
the contract several times.

696
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:44,304
Only authorized personnel
are allowed in here.

697
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:45,597
Move aside.

698
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,475
A contract formed
under such coercion is legally void.

699
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:49,726
That's not my concern.

700
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:52,312
I'm simply following orders
to not let anyone in.

701
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:55,273
Hynic Core Inc.

702
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:57,400
isn't just a workplace.

703
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:00,153
It's a legacy shaped
by the hard work, passion,

704
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:03,907
and youth of each and every employee.

705
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:08,453
Please allow my employees
to continue working.

706
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:11,164
Yes, I give you my word.

707
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:15,502
Mr. Lee,

708
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:18,797
it's time for you to make a decision.

709
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:24,761
PARTY B, ASSIGNOR LEE SEONG-BIN

710
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,354
Ms. Kwon!

711
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:38,858
What?

712
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:40,485
Get out of the way, you thugs!

713
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:41,820
Mr. Lee Seong-bin!

714
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:43,321
- Seong-bin!
- Mr. Lee!

715
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,740
Don't touch me! I'll sue you!

716
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:47,075
Let go of me!

717
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,284
Out of my way!

718
00:38:48,368 --> 00:38:49,410
Let go of me!

719
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,665
- Seong-bin!
- Mr. Lee!

720
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:56,125
How did you…

721
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:57,836
You damn snitch!

722
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:00,588
How can you side with Optalyn?

723
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:02,423
What's the matter with you?

724
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:04,425
Don't sign that, Seong-bin.

725
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:05,844
Get them out now!

726
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:07,720
What do you think you're doing?

727
00:39:07,804 --> 00:39:08,972
Mr. Lee.

728
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,932
This is unacceptable.

729
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:16,688
You have less than ten minutes.

730
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:20,400
The offer of 20 billion won will be
automatically withdrawn after 6 p.m.

731
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:26,155
Hang on.

732
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:28,324
Give me a minute.

733
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:35,665
I'm backed into a corner.

734
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:38,001
My house has already been auctioned off,

735
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:40,003
and you, Seung-nam,

736
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:42,881
and the others even took out
private loans because of me.

737
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:45,091
That's not on you.

738
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:47,260
Hynic Core isn't yours alone.

739
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:50,513
We invested because we trusted
the technology and the company.

740
00:39:50,597 --> 00:39:52,223
That decision was ours to make.

741
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:54,475
Why would you
take responsibility for that?

742
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:55,643
Mr. Lee.

743
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:57,854
This isn't right.

744
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:59,230
Mr. Lee.

745
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:02,734
Give us the chance to correct this.

746
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:14,537
I'm sorry,

747
00:40:15,622 --> 00:40:17,624
but I won't sign the deal.

748
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:18,833
Mr. Lee!

749
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:22,003
Mr. Ban, is this how you handle things?

750
00:40:22,629 --> 00:40:24,047
File the Bluestone complaint

751
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,424
and charge everyone involved with fraud.

752
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:27,508
Okay.

753
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,177
Sir.

754
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:35,850
Why don't we find a way
for everyone to survive?

755
00:40:45,485 --> 00:40:47,862
We can simply take this to court.

756
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:50,448
I'm sure you'll win.

757
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,951
But debt collection is another matter.

758
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:56,746
Bluestone has already distributed
120 billion won to the beneficiaries,

759
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:58,790
so there's no money in the fund.

760
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,375
Even if the court puts liability

761
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,585
on the asset management company
or Mr. Ban,

762
00:41:02,669 --> 00:41:03,836
they have no ability to pay.

763
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,507
Which means you'll have nothing to gain
even if you win the lawsuit.

764
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:08,591
You know that.

765
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:12,387
Sell Hynic Core

766
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:15,431
back to Bluestone for 120 billion won.

767
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:19,060
I will make sure Bluestone
can return the 120 billion won.

768
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:23,231
We've made moves based on our trust
in Hynic Core's technology.

769
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:24,816
Without it,

770
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:28,486
recovering the 120 billion would
still leave us with significant losses.

771
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:38,162
I want any evidence
related to Mr. Ko Seung-cheol.

772
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:41,374
What will you do with that?

773
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:43,126
Are you going to kick him out of Yullim?

774
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:44,252
Yes.

775
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:48,089
We'll propose his dismissal
for violating the partnership agreement.

776
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,507
And

777
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:53,261
we'll make sure he can never commit
such modern-day treachery again.

778
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,517
You honestly believe greenhorns like you

779
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,894
could even lay a finger on Mr. Ko?

780
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,522
There's a whole faction behind Mr. Ko.

781
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:06,774
Nurtured protégés like myself

782
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:10,361
and high-ranking executives
brought up by the kingmaker Ko Seung-cheol

783
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:14,657
are spread across the legal,
financial, and political worlds.

784
00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:18,077
I'll try laying my finger on him, then.

785
00:42:18,745 --> 00:42:21,122
Mr. Lee Seong-bin
will complete the technology

786
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:25,376
and grant Optalyn
an exclusive license to use it.

787
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:28,671
Does that mean you'll grant usage rights

788
00:42:28,755 --> 00:42:30,882
but keep the technology itself?

789
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:33,718
Yes, the source code
will remain a black box

790
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:35,386
and will be provided in AIP format.

791
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:37,472
That's the condition.

792
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:40,099
Encryption
and reverse-engineering prevention.

793
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:42,852
We'll get back to you
on the license royalty.

794
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:47,273
What if we refuse?

795
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:50,359
We've secured evidence
with Ha Du-sik's help.

796
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:53,279
That's more than enough

797
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,907
to lay my finger on him.

798
00:42:55,990 --> 00:43:00,495
We just want more solid proof. That's it.

799
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:01,871
Give me…

800
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:05,416
that proof.

801
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,085
Without Mr. Lee Seong-bin,

802
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:10,379
the technology can neither
be perfected nor realized.

803
00:43:11,047 --> 00:43:12,924
Even if you win the lawsuit,

804
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:15,885
failing to collect will cost you billions.

805
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:19,597
And if you lose the chance
to capture the market with the technology,

806
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:21,516
the loss will be even greater.

807
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,896
This offer is only valid here and now.

808
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:33,402
Along with Mr. Ko's share of the profits,
I will persuade the other beneficiaries

809
00:43:33,486 --> 00:43:35,780
to return the 120 billion won to Optalyn.

810
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:39,117
We'll return Hynic Core
to its original shareholders

811
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,160
once our 15 billion-won investment

812
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:43,746
is repaid in full with interest.

813
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:49,585
The numbers still don't add up.

814
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:55,049
Let me add one more thing.

815
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:10,273
Okay. We'll take the deal.

816
00:44:24,704 --> 00:44:25,663
Hello.

817
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:26,998
Name for the reservation?

818
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:28,249
Heart Logic.

819
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:31,627
Yes, your party is already here.

820
00:44:31,711 --> 00:44:32,712
Please follow me.

821
00:44:37,884 --> 00:44:39,927
- This way, please.
- Thank you.

822
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:47,518
Hello.

823
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:51,522
What?

824
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,900
What are you doing here?

825
00:44:53,983 --> 00:44:57,695
What are<i> you</i> doing here?

826
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:02,366
No way. Heart Logic?

827
00:45:02,992 --> 00:45:03,993
Don't tell me

828
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:07,997
this is what I think it is.

829
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:10,082
I think it is.

830
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:22,678
Hello.

831
00:45:22,762 --> 00:45:25,264
There's a lady in front of me
who's 11 years younger than me

832
00:45:25,348 --> 00:45:27,558
and has never been married.

833
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:29,560
I was looking
for someone closer to my age

834
00:45:29,644 --> 00:45:31,520
who's also been through a divorce.

835
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:35,483
Our AI analyzes your stated preferences
and your actual compatibility,

836
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:39,946
then suggests the most balanced match.

837
00:45:40,029 --> 00:45:42,073
<i>According to our AI's recommendation,</i>

838
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:45,993
<i>you're a perfect match.</i>
<i>That's why we matched you two.</i>

839
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:47,912
We're canceling today's arrangement.

840
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:50,081
If this happens again,
I'll withdraw my membership.

841
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:52,541
<i>It must have caught you off guard</i>

842
00:45:52,625 --> 00:45:55,962
<i>to be matched with someone younger</i>
<i>who hasn't been divorced.</i>

843
00:45:56,045 --> 00:45:58,589
<i>Going forward, we'll prioritize</i>
<i>your individual preferences</i>

844
00:45:58,673 --> 00:46:01,467
<i>over the AI's analysis.</i>

845
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:04,470
<i>For today, I hope you can enjoy your meal</i>

846
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:07,932
<i>and make the most of your time together.</i>

847
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:10,393
No, I'd rather not.

848
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:11,352
Bye.

849
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,571
Hello.

850
00:46:28,411 --> 00:46:29,412
No.

851
00:46:30,705 --> 00:46:35,126
I actually think
he and I are a great match.

852
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:39,714
I even bought new clothes
and went to the hair salon to prepare.

853
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:41,882
And this place is a real gem for dining.

854
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:45,219
Yes. Okay.

855
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:48,014
Would you like to order?

856
00:46:48,097 --> 00:46:49,557
Could you give us a moment?

857
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:52,560
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

858
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:53,769
I'll head out.

859
00:46:53,853 --> 00:46:55,896
Enjoy the meal. It's on me.

860
00:46:56,689 --> 00:46:58,399
Eat with me.

861
00:46:58,482 --> 00:46:59,775
Their food is really good.

862
00:46:59,859 --> 00:47:02,278
I'm sure you haven't eaten.

863
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,363
I'm good.

864
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:10,244
Can I order for one person?

865
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:13,664
I'm sorry, but we can only take orders
for two or more people.

866
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:18,419
Then I'll order for two.

867
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:22,548
I'm sorry, we don't seat solo diners here
since this is a central spot.

868
00:47:23,341 --> 00:47:25,801
Is it okay if I move you to the bar?

869
00:47:25,885 --> 00:47:28,304
We'll order for two.

870
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:30,556
Okay.

871
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:32,767
Why don't you like me?

872
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:35,186
I never said that.
I said we're not a good match.

873
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:36,312
Why not?

874
00:47:38,064 --> 00:47:39,440
You're my junior colleague,

875
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:42,443
you're a lot younger than me,
and you've never been married.

876
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:47,156
I didn't expect
it would be a disadvantage.

877
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:48,991
It's not about advantages
or disadvantages.

878
00:47:49,075 --> 00:47:52,203
So you're saying I'm overqualified.

879
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:55,748
"Kang Hyo-min is overqualified
for her date, Yoon Seok-hoon."

880
00:47:57,083 --> 00:47:59,835
It's just one date, not a wedding.

881
00:47:59,919 --> 00:48:01,587
Just be my date tonight.

882
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:04,340
You've already cleared your schedule
for this anyway.

883
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:06,926
What should we do after?

884
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,844
Do we have to do something after dinner?

885
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:10,596
Seok-hoon…

886
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:12,723
Seok-hoon?

887
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:14,934
You're my date tonight.

888
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:17,853
I can't keep addressing you as Mr. Yoon.

889
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:23,859
Anyway, you'll pay
for the dinner, won't you?

890
00:48:24,777 --> 00:48:25,653
Yes.

891
00:48:26,362 --> 00:48:28,406
I can't mooch off you for dinner

892
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:30,950
and not even buy you a cup of coffee.

893
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:32,201
I'm okay with that.

894
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:33,452
I'm not.

895
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:40,292
But the weather is a bit too nice
for just a cup of coffee.

896
00:48:41,961 --> 00:48:44,964
How about a walk in the park and a beer?

897
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:49,677
You smiled.

898
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,928
It's a date.

899
00:48:54,807 --> 00:48:56,892
That's why you're going on blind dates.

900
00:48:58,686 --> 00:49:01,063
So basically,

901
00:49:01,147 --> 00:49:06,152
she should be a divorcée
in her late thirties who's into dogs.

902
00:49:06,235 --> 00:49:07,403
Well,

903
00:49:08,571 --> 00:49:11,449
I don't need my life partner
to fit a specific mold.

904
00:49:11,991 --> 00:49:15,953
I just think it would be easier
if she and I had similar backgrounds.

905
00:49:17,997 --> 00:49:19,081
"Life partner."

906
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:22,042
I like that term.

907
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:25,504
I think marriage is difficult.

908
00:49:26,255 --> 00:49:28,716
Loving someone
isn't reason enough to get married,

909
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:31,969
and getting married
doesn't guarantee that love will last.

910
00:49:32,845 --> 00:49:35,014
You can't separate love from marriage,

911
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:37,099
but they do feel somewhat different.

912
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:39,727
In what way?

913
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:40,895
Well,

914
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:45,232
if love is about looking at each other,

915
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:46,775
marriage is…

916
00:49:48,194 --> 00:49:50,529
about looking in the same direction.

917
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:53,782
That's right.

918
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:58,245
I liked what you said.

919
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:00,039
What did I say?

920
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:03,167
"Love between a couple
starts with passion,

921
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:07,755
goes through reality,
and ends in solidarity."

922
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:11,091
"Losing passion

923
00:50:11,175 --> 00:50:14,428
doesn't mean losing love."

924
00:50:14,512 --> 00:50:17,515
I agree with what you said too.

925
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:21,227
"Maybe marriage isn't
the culmination of love

926
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:23,979
but the process of exhausting it."

927
00:50:25,189 --> 00:50:26,357
My dream…

928
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:29,693
was a lifelong companion,

929
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:33,280
walking side by side with me
toward the same goal.

930
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,699
But in reality,

931
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,829
my marriage seemed
to be a process of exhausting love.

932
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:44,500
And sometimes…

933
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:49,630
I feel like my life is a failure.

934
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:51,674
Why?

935
00:50:52,341 --> 00:50:53,759
Because you got divorced?

936
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:56,303
Yes.

937
00:50:57,096 --> 00:50:58,639
I don't think so.

938
00:50:59,807 --> 00:51:02,893
Some loves are epic tales,

939
00:51:02,977 --> 00:51:06,063
and some are short stories.

940
00:51:06,689 --> 00:51:10,442
Just because you wrote a short story
doesn't mean it's a failure.

941
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:15,155
Is that so?

942
00:51:15,698 --> 00:51:16,782
Yes.

943
00:51:17,575 --> 00:51:20,119
It's not a failure.

944
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:23,163
It just means one book has ended.

945
00:51:25,374 --> 00:51:27,126
You need to write another one.

946
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:28,877
One with passionate romance.

947
00:51:31,005 --> 00:51:32,006
Right.

948
00:51:35,593 --> 00:51:38,345
- What?
- I think my heel's wobbly.

949
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:40,139
Should we stop walking?

950
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:42,057
- Should we go home?
- No.

951
00:51:44,852 --> 00:51:46,478
Let's walk just a little more.

952
00:51:46,979 --> 00:51:48,397
The weather's nice.

953
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:52,735
Here.

954
00:52:05,706 --> 00:52:08,626
By the way, did you change your cologne?

955
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:11,879
Yes.

956
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:13,839
Why?

957
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:19,094
To write a new story.

958
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:25,893
Mr. Yoon was there?

959
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,269
Yes.

960
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:28,729
How did that happen?

961
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:30,522
How was it?
Did you both leave right away?

962
00:52:30,606 --> 00:52:32,983
You said you had dinner.
Did you have dinner with him?

963
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:35,944
Tell us in detail.
Don't leave anything out.

964
00:52:37,196 --> 00:52:41,867
We were both shocked at first,

965
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:43,994
but I asked him to continue our date.

966
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:46,038
He was going to leave,

967
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:49,208
but we ended up having dinner
and even going on a walk together.

968
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:53,212
I held… his arm.

969
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:55,172
- His arm?
- His arm?

970
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:56,507
How was it?

971
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:59,927
- It was good.
- What was good?

972
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:01,679
We consoled

973
00:53:03,222 --> 00:53:04,181
each other.

974
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:08,143
Oh boy. They say consolation
is the seed of love.

975
00:53:08,227 --> 00:53:09,269
Love?

976
00:53:09,353 --> 00:53:11,605
Hey, he's my boss. How disrespectful!

977
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:13,524
That's not what your face is saying.

978
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:17,069
Didn't you tell us
that you don't need love?

979
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:19,947
You said we're all you need.

980
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,740
Do you still buy that?

981
00:53:21,824 --> 00:53:24,576
That's what we say after fighting
or breaking up with our boyfriends.

982
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:27,246
- Accept it.
- Accept what?

983
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:30,332
We always come second to each other.

984
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:32,584
No way.

985
00:53:32,668 --> 00:53:34,128
Is that a bad thing?

986
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:35,796
I like it.

987
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,047
Being second?

988
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:38,507
Yes. Look.

989
00:53:39,675 --> 00:53:43,011
For us, our boyfriends, family,
or future husband and children

990
00:53:43,095 --> 00:53:44,888
will inevitably come first.

991
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:47,141
But those priorities aren't perfect.

992
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:50,602
They hurt us and disappoint us.

993
00:53:51,687 --> 00:53:53,021
Sometimes, they betray us.

994
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:55,149
But that's fine

995
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:58,777
because we always have
our second priorities to support us.

996
00:53:59,862 --> 00:54:02,573
We're each other's safeguard,
standing just a step behind.

997
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:03,532
That's us.

998
00:54:05,451 --> 00:54:06,493
That's touching.

999
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:08,912
You're right.

1000
00:54:09,538 --> 00:54:13,083
I can love again
and go through all the ups and downs

1001
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:17,755
because you're right behind me.

1002
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:22,593
- Come on.
- Jeez.

1003
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:23,844
I love you.

1004
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:24,887
I don't.

1005
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:30,726
- I love you.
- Stop it.

1006
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:32,352
That's enough.

1007
00:54:41,195 --> 00:54:42,529
So basically,

1008
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:45,365
to oust Mr. Ko Seung-cheol,

1009
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:48,118
you need my vote.

1010
00:54:48,869 --> 00:54:49,995
That's right.

1011
00:55:03,217 --> 00:55:04,343
Mr. Kim,

1012
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:08,597
this is about Yullim's honor
and very existence.

1013
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:13,644
I understand.

1014
00:55:16,605 --> 00:55:18,106
Give me some time to think.

1015
00:55:28,909 --> 00:55:30,035
All right.

1016
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:33,247
Take your time and let me know.

1017
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:38,043
Don't do anything until I make a decision.

1018
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:40,754
Yes, sir.

1019
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:50,597
Gosh.

1020
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:53,267
It's been a while.

1021
00:55:53,934 --> 00:55:55,769
Back when I was out doing sales,

1022
00:55:55,853 --> 00:55:58,647
I'd just down my drink
without a moment to savor it.

1023
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:01,650
We drank like fish back then.

1024
00:56:03,694 --> 00:56:05,112
Do you remember?

1025
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:08,699
When we were in sales, we drank so much

1026
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:12,119
that all three of us, Myeong-jin included,
were taken to the hospital.

1027
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:14,997
I remember that.

1028
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:16,915
My goodness.

1029
00:56:17,541 --> 00:56:21,044
Back then, law firms were like lobbyists,
hiring ex-officials

1030
00:56:21,128 --> 00:56:24,548
from the Fair Trade Commission
and the Financial Supervisory Service

1031
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:28,093
to reduce corporate fines
and adjust the level of sanctions.

1032
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:30,345
That's what we did back then.

1033
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:33,432
Nowadays, we'd be in big trouble
if we did that.

1034
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:35,142
There are things

1035
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:37,728
that worked back then but no longer work.

1036
00:56:43,609 --> 00:56:44,776
Go on, then.

1037
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:47,487
Sorry?

1038
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:51,158
You've been following me around for days,
unable to get it off your chest.

1039
00:56:51,742 --> 00:56:53,035
Well…

1040
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:54,328
What is it?

1041
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:01,877
Did Kwon Na-yeon talk to you?

1042
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:05,881
Yes.

1043
00:57:09,343 --> 00:57:10,510
Do you remember

1044
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:14,932
what you told me
when we first started Yullim?

1045
00:57:15,015 --> 00:57:16,433
What did I say?

1046
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:18,435
When I asked you

1047
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:22,981
why you were giving me so many shares
if I hadn't really done much,

1048
00:57:24,733 --> 00:57:25,901
you said,

1049
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:27,819
"Your shares will be

1050
00:57:27,903 --> 00:57:30,155
the last counterbalance
to protect Yullim."

1051
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:32,783
Did I say that?

1052
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:36,244
I didn't understand
what it meant back then,

1053
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:38,121
but now I do.

1054
00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:42,709
You kept me as a safeguard

1055
00:57:43,752 --> 00:57:46,463
in case you ever became
corrupted in the future.

1056
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:48,757
You could have arranged
the share structure

1057
00:57:49,758 --> 00:57:51,760
so that no one could expel you.

1058
00:57:52,678 --> 00:57:55,222
But instead, you put a check on yourself.

1059
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:59,351
You chose me as the final safeguard

1060
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:03,271
to prevent your whims or corruption

1061
00:58:03,981 --> 00:58:05,565
from bringing Yullim down.

1062
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:11,405
Do you think
you're that important to the firm?

1063
00:58:12,531 --> 00:58:13,407
Gosh.

1064
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:17,160
You're right.

1065
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:21,832
The reason I chose you

1066
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:25,919
was because I believed
you would always make

1067
00:58:27,713 --> 00:58:30,674
selfless decisions for the sake of Yullim.

1068
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:36,680
I know I'm not that great a lawyer.

1069
00:58:39,975 --> 00:58:42,978
But I do believe I have the eye
to recognize talented people,

1070
00:58:43,729 --> 00:58:46,857
as well as the generosity
and wisdom to nurture them.

1071
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:52,571
I believe that collection of talents
will become Yullim's backbone,

1072
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:55,615
and the fortress they build

1073
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:58,285
will stand on a solid foundation,

1074
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:01,038
not on shifting sand.

1075
00:59:03,999 --> 00:59:05,333
The name "Yullim" was made

1076
00:59:07,127 --> 00:59:09,379
by taking a character from my own name.

1077
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:12,549
Based on the loyalty you instilled in me,

1078
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:15,927
I will carry out the mission

1079
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:19,514
that your past self left me.

1080
00:59:21,433 --> 00:59:23,226
Even if it goes against you now.

1081
00:59:24,895 --> 00:59:26,521
This is not a discussion.

1082
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:31,276
It's a notice.

1083
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:54,382
Is that Hyo-min?

1084
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:58,095
What are you doing here?

1085
00:59:58,637 --> 00:59:59,805
Hi, Hyo-min.

1086
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:01,932
I haven't seen that outfit before.

1087
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:03,350
How chic.

1088
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:05,727
Cherry must be hungry.

1089
01:00:05,811 --> 01:00:07,187
I should feed her.

1090
01:00:08,939 --> 01:00:09,856
Come in.

1091
01:00:13,235 --> 01:00:16,905
- We're home, Cherry.
- My goodness.

1092
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:20,158
Have you eaten yet?

1093
01:00:23,495 --> 01:00:24,579
Have you eaten yet?

1094
01:00:24,663 --> 01:00:27,082
Right. Food.

1095
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:30,210
No.

1096
01:00:31,545 --> 01:00:34,464
Let me quickly feed Cherry,
and then we should eat too.

1097
01:00:35,132 --> 01:00:37,676
It's so nice to see you
unexpectedly like this.

1098
01:00:38,552 --> 01:00:39,970
Go wash your hands.

1099
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:42,013
You should get changed too, Honey.

1100
01:00:42,097 --> 01:00:43,932
- I'll take care of this.
- Okay.

1101
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:44,975
Take a seat.

1102
01:00:49,146 --> 01:00:50,147
Mom…

1103
01:00:54,693 --> 01:00:55,735
Auntie.

1104
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:08,623
I'm probably surprising you
by dropping in unannounced.

1105
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:15,964
How can you talk?

1106
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:17,924
Can you hear me?

1107
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:20,260
I…

1108
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:23,763
can read lips.

1109
01:01:35,609 --> 01:01:37,235
FOR CHERRY

1110
01:01:41,406 --> 01:01:42,699
Thank you.

1111
01:01:46,077 --> 01:01:47,287
Hyo-ju.

1112
01:01:55,462 --> 01:02:00,508
Can I… see you again?

1113
01:02:04,221 --> 01:02:06,640
I learned sign language

1114
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:11,519
to talk to you in case I saw you.

1115
01:02:16,608 --> 01:02:19,986
I'm… sorry.

1116
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:24,741
I've always felt bad.

1117
01:02:28,912 --> 01:02:29,996
My daughter.

1118
01:02:33,041 --> 01:02:34,042
I'm sorry.

1119
01:02:37,212 --> 01:02:39,464
This whole time I couldn't visit

1120
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:41,633
because I thought
it might make you feel bad,

1121
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:46,054
and that is why I came today.

1122
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:52,477
I've been happy. I am happy.

1123
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:55,438
And I will stay happy.

1124
01:02:55,522 --> 01:02:57,148
Okay.

1125
01:03:29,889 --> 01:03:32,934
The reason we're here is not pleasant,
so let's get straight to the point.

1126
01:03:33,018 --> 01:03:34,519
You're proposing my dismissal?

1127
01:03:34,602 --> 01:03:35,854
Yes, I am.

1128
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:39,316
Ms. Kwon, can't you read the room?

1129
01:03:39,399 --> 01:03:42,777
Counting Shin Myeong-jin, Ko Seung-cheol,
Kim Yul-seong, Ko Tae-seop,

1130
01:03:42,861 --> 01:03:47,240
Choi Hui-cheol, and my own shares,
we surpass the majority.

1131
01:03:47,324 --> 01:03:48,742
No matter what you do,

1132
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:51,411
the motion to dismiss Mr. Ko can't pass.

1133
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:52,746
Still, I'll give it a go.

1134
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:54,664
Who knows?

1135
01:03:54,748 --> 01:03:58,335
Someone you thought was on your side
might support the dismissal.

1136
01:03:58,418 --> 01:03:59,627
My gosh.

1137
01:04:00,712 --> 01:04:03,048
Let's hear your terms first.

1138
01:04:03,131 --> 01:04:07,469
You appointed me as the head,
so let me do my job.

1139
01:04:07,552 --> 01:04:09,387
During my three-year term,

1140
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:11,931
place the voting rights
of Mr. Shin Myeong-jin

1141
01:04:12,015 --> 01:04:15,101
and your own in my trust.

1142
01:04:15,185 --> 01:04:16,561
And

1143
01:04:17,604 --> 01:04:21,691
never try to oust me again

1144
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:24,069
through schemes.

1145
01:04:24,152 --> 01:04:25,278
Above all,

1146
01:04:26,613 --> 01:04:29,616
drop the dirty trick of using a young man

1147
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:32,285
to fabricate a scandal.

1148
01:04:33,453 --> 01:04:34,454
A young man?

1149
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:36,247
That's…

1150
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:46,091
I understand. Let's do it.

1151
01:04:46,174 --> 01:04:48,426
- Mr. Ko.
- Get me the papers.

1152
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:50,678
- I'll sign them.
- Why don't you take some time?

1153
01:04:50,762 --> 01:04:52,806
You may leave, Mr. Ha.

1154
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:54,432
But Mr. Ko--

1155
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:56,935
Yes, sir.

1156
01:05:07,862 --> 01:05:09,239
You joined Yullim

1157
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:14,953
when we had fewer than 30 attorneys,

1158
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:16,454
didn't you?

1159
01:05:16,538 --> 01:05:17,455
Yes.

1160
01:05:18,248 --> 01:05:20,708
You interviewed me yourself.

1161
01:05:21,543 --> 01:05:23,294
I remember that day clearly.

1162
01:05:23,378 --> 01:05:26,631
You looked so sharp
that I knew you'd be good at your job.

1163
01:05:36,683 --> 01:05:39,102
Mr. Kim Yul-seong came to me.

1164
01:05:41,688 --> 01:05:44,023
For a moment, I'd forgotten

1165
01:05:44,107 --> 01:05:46,734
what Yullim means to me.

1166
01:05:49,237 --> 01:05:53,366
I'm not stepping down
because you're pressuring me.

1167
01:05:54,451 --> 01:05:56,911
It's because of my love for Yullim.

1168
01:05:58,580 --> 01:06:01,124
Yullim is like my own child.

1169
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:03,668
I've poured everything I have into it.

1170
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:09,507
But these days,

1171
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:13,178
I feel that we need a fresh change

1172
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:17,474
because sticking to the old ways
won't get us anywhere.

1173
01:06:19,893 --> 01:06:22,479
So I'm giving you a chance

1174
01:06:23,605 --> 01:06:26,024
to see if you can make a change.

1175
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:27,567
Yes, Mr. Ko.

1176
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:32,447
Some use the law as a weapon,

1177
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:36,242
and others use it as a tool.

1178
01:06:39,954 --> 01:06:42,165
What is the difference between the two?

1179
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:43,249
I'm not sure.

1180
01:06:43,791 --> 01:06:46,336
The former tries to uphold the law,

1181
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:49,464
while the latter tries to rule over it.

1182
01:06:49,547 --> 01:06:53,885
I am the latter, and you are the former.

1183
01:06:53,968 --> 01:07:00,308
Unfortunately, the former
has never once beaten the latter.

1184
01:07:00,934 --> 01:07:02,268
With all due respect,

1185
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:05,563
exploiting loopholes in the law

1186
01:07:05,647 --> 01:07:08,983
to gain profit
and manipulate it like you do

1187
01:07:09,484 --> 01:07:11,277
is not the path I intend to take.

1188
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:15,490
I will use the law as a weapon

1189
01:07:16,199 --> 01:07:18,284
to build a fair system.

1190
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:20,745
You see,

1191
01:07:21,496 --> 01:07:24,123
I thought the same when I was your age.

1192
01:07:24,207 --> 01:07:26,960
I believed that skill alone
would be enough to succeed.

1193
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:30,922
But in reality, it's never that simple.

1194
01:07:32,215 --> 01:07:35,593
I'll face reality myself
and make my own judgment.

1195
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:37,595
Suit yourself.

1196
01:07:39,222 --> 01:07:41,057
Just don't break.

1197
01:07:42,183 --> 01:07:46,062
True strength lies in the flexibility

1198
01:07:46,813 --> 01:07:49,774
to bend at times rather than snap.

1199
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:52,151
In that sense,

1200
01:07:52,235 --> 01:07:56,239
make good use of Mr. Yoon.

1201
01:07:56,322 --> 01:08:00,201
For someone like you,
he could prove invaluable.

1202
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:04,414
Thank you for the advice.

1203
01:08:06,291 --> 01:08:08,167
I have another engagement now.

1204
01:08:08,668 --> 01:08:11,170
Right. I'll get going, then.

1205
01:08:18,136 --> 01:08:19,262
Please…

1206
01:08:24,601 --> 01:08:25,893
take good care of Yullim.

1207
01:08:30,398 --> 01:08:31,524
I will, Mr. Ko.

1208
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:50,418
You did well.

1209
01:08:50,501 --> 01:08:51,878
Let's do this right.

1210
01:09:02,263 --> 01:09:03,848
I will now deliver the verdict.

1211
01:09:04,515 --> 01:09:05,933
From the outset,

1212
01:09:06,017 --> 01:09:08,686
the plaintiff, Ko Min-chan,
and the defendant, Park Hyeon-yeong,

1213
01:09:08,770 --> 01:09:14,192
lacked any intent
for physical or emotional union,

1214
01:09:14,275 --> 01:09:19,364
and it has since been maintained
without the substance of a marriage.

1215
01:09:19,447 --> 01:09:23,159
In addition, the plaintiff
has unequivocally expressed

1216
01:09:23,242 --> 01:09:25,161
the impossibility
of continuing the marriage,

1217
01:09:25,244 --> 01:09:27,914
and the defendant's
genuine intent to reconcile

1218
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:31,668
cannot be recognized.
Taking these circumstances into account,

1219
01:09:31,751 --> 01:09:35,254
the court finds that this matter falls

1220
01:09:35,922 --> 01:09:39,008
within Article 840,
Paragraph 6 of the Civil Act,

1221
01:09:39,092 --> 01:09:42,178
a serious cause making it
difficult to continue the marriage,

1222
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:44,681
and hereby grants the plaintiff's claim

1223
01:09:45,723 --> 01:09:47,225
for divorce.

1224
01:09:49,352 --> 01:09:52,397
As someone who has handled
divorce cases for a long time,

1225
01:09:53,106 --> 01:09:54,816
I will add just one remark.

1226
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:58,653
Love is not perfect,

1227
01:09:59,362 --> 01:10:04,283
and marriage is the process
of enduring that imperfect love together.

1228
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:09,330
That process can be difficult
and can fail.

1229
01:10:09,414 --> 01:10:12,083
And sometimes divorce
is chosen as a result.

1230
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:15,628
However, if we exclude love
from the very beginning

1231
01:10:15,712 --> 01:10:17,130
just because it is difficult,

1232
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:22,802
we lose the most essential value
in the journey of marriage.

1233
01:10:24,262 --> 01:10:27,724
Although the marital relationship
will come to an end,

1234
01:10:27,807 --> 01:10:31,686
I hope that the sincerity
and responsibility that existed within it

1235
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:33,521
will remain for a long time.

1236
01:10:34,439 --> 01:10:37,316
This concludes the court's ruling.

1237
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:06,804
You held up well.

1238
01:11:09,307 --> 01:11:13,019
This ruling views love
as the essence of marriage,

1239
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:16,773
but I believe responsibility
can also be its essence.

1240
01:11:16,856 --> 01:11:19,859
I hope you understand
that this outcome does not negate

1241
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:22,570
your responsibility as a parent

1242
01:11:22,653 --> 01:11:25,948
nor the respect and sincerity
contained within it.

1243
01:11:26,032 --> 01:11:27,492
I don't think that way.

1244
01:11:27,575 --> 01:11:28,743
Thank you, Mr. Yoon.

1245
01:11:29,368 --> 01:11:31,120
Thank you, Ms. Kang.

1246
01:11:31,204 --> 01:11:32,747
Thank you.

1247
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:40,254
I'll go…

1248
01:11:42,048 --> 01:11:43,216
and pick up Min.

1249
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:46,677
If you have time…

1250
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:49,597
Gosh.

1251
01:11:51,182 --> 01:11:52,141
Never mind.

1252
01:11:52,683 --> 01:11:54,227
I'll get going.

1253
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:55,561
I'll join you.

1254
01:11:56,437 --> 01:11:57,563
Let's have dinner too.

1255
01:11:58,314 --> 01:11:59,440
Really?

1256
01:11:59,524 --> 01:12:00,650
Can you make time?

1257
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:03,778
Then let's have dinner together,
the three of us.

1258
01:12:03,861 --> 01:12:05,738
We eat out too often these days.

1259
01:12:05,822 --> 01:12:07,281
You do it often as well.

1260
01:12:07,949 --> 01:12:09,826
What if Min's eczema flares up again?

1261
01:12:10,451 --> 01:12:12,995
I found a temple cuisine place
that only uses organic ingredients.

1262
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:14,622
No additives, and the seasoning's light.

1263
01:12:14,705 --> 01:12:16,457
Really? Where?

1264
01:12:22,088 --> 01:12:23,047
Are you okay?

1265
01:12:24,674 --> 01:12:26,008
Don't be nervous.

1266
01:12:26,092 --> 01:12:27,385
- I'm not.
- Really?

1267
01:12:28,886 --> 01:12:30,346
Why am I getting nervous?

1268
01:12:31,264 --> 01:12:32,932
- I am too.
- Right?

1269
01:12:33,015 --> 01:12:34,934
She already said yes, right?

1270
01:12:35,017 --> 01:12:36,477
It's just a formality, right?

1271
01:12:37,728 --> 01:12:39,313
- No.
- What?

1272
01:12:39,897 --> 01:12:41,107
So she could say no?

1273
01:12:42,692 --> 01:12:43,568
Yes.

1274
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:45,695
This is crazy.

1275
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:48,030
What made you so confident to invite us?

1276
01:12:48,114 --> 01:12:50,741
Do you know how living together
is different from marriage?

1277
01:12:52,952 --> 01:12:53,828
What is it?

1278
01:12:53,911 --> 01:12:56,581
Living together is an agreement
between two people,

1279
01:12:56,664 --> 01:13:00,501
but marriage is declaring that agreement
to family, friends, and the world.

1280
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:03,713
So even a marriage proposal
needs witnesses.

1281
01:13:03,796 --> 01:13:06,048
Especially if someone like
Mr. Yoon is here.

1282
01:13:06,841 --> 01:13:07,925
It carries more weight.

1283
01:13:08,009 --> 01:13:09,510
You have a point.

1284
01:13:10,595 --> 01:13:13,598
Hyo-min said she'd cover
Min-jeon's eyes as they walk in,

1285
01:13:13,681 --> 01:13:16,475
so start the music
as soon as Min-jeong shows up.

1286
01:13:16,559 --> 01:13:17,476
Good.

1287
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:19,937
Here they come.

1288
01:13:20,021 --> 01:13:21,480
Okay!

1289
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:24,150
I've never felt anything like this before.

1290
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:26,110
Be careful.

1291
01:13:26,986 --> 01:13:28,779
The ground is lumpy.

1292
01:13:28,863 --> 01:13:29,822
Be careful.

1293
01:13:30,364 --> 01:13:32,408
To the right.

1294
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:37,163
- How much longer?
- You're almost there.

1295
01:13:37,955 --> 01:13:40,374
- What is this?
- Be careful.

1296
01:13:41,792 --> 01:13:43,127
- You can stand here.
- Here?

1297
01:13:46,964 --> 01:13:48,174
Can I open my eyes?

1298
01:13:52,845 --> 01:13:54,096
What's with the clapping?

1299
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:56,849
What's all this?

1300
01:13:58,392 --> 01:13:59,268
Min-jeong.

1301
01:14:00,519 --> 01:14:01,646
Hi.

1302
01:14:03,147 --> 01:14:04,315
I jotted down

1303
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:06,859
a few words yesterday

1304
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:10,071
for this very moment.

1305
01:14:10,821 --> 01:14:13,699
A vow of my love to you, my darling.

1306
01:14:14,408 --> 01:14:15,493
"My darling"?

1307
01:14:18,496 --> 01:14:19,914
VOW OF LOVE

1308
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:23,626
What are you doing?

1309
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:25,586
Come on.

1310
01:14:30,257 --> 01:14:31,550
"Vow of Love."

1311
01:14:31,634 --> 01:14:33,552
"With you, I will cherish

1312
01:14:33,636 --> 01:14:37,306
the first spark of our love
even as time goes by,

1313
01:14:37,390 --> 01:14:41,936
and I will uphold
my respect and trust in you."

1314
01:14:42,603 --> 01:14:44,939
"May today's love carry into tomorrow,

1315
01:14:45,815 --> 01:14:49,986
and may tomorrow's love
deepen into eternity."

1316
01:14:51,195 --> 01:14:52,989
"And the name of that eternity…"

1317
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:05,918
Now that I'm reading it out loud,

1318
01:15:06,419 --> 01:15:08,754
it's a bit weird.

1319
01:15:10,423 --> 01:15:14,093
It all sounds a bit too perfect.

1320
01:15:15,678 --> 01:15:18,639
So it doesn't sound like my own words.

1321
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:20,141
Right?

1322
01:15:20,224 --> 01:15:21,100
A little bit.

1323
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:23,811
I keep saying I love you

1324
01:15:25,438 --> 01:15:28,899
and promising
that my love will last forever,

1325
01:15:30,109 --> 01:15:31,277
but the truth is…

1326
01:15:33,195 --> 01:15:37,158
I'm not even sure
I know what love really is.

1327
01:15:38,701 --> 01:15:41,829
I guess it makes sense.

1328
01:15:42,621 --> 01:15:43,873
After all,

1329
01:15:44,749 --> 01:15:46,459
no one tells us

1330
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:49,336
how we're supposed to love each other.

1331
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:52,757
So it seems

1332
01:15:53,883 --> 01:15:55,843
we only learn what love is

1333
01:15:56,427 --> 01:15:58,929
after being hurt,

1334
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:04,477
and we realize its value
only after losing it.

1335
01:16:06,771 --> 01:16:08,189
That's how, step by step,

1336
01:16:09,190 --> 01:16:10,483
we've come…

1337
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:14,028
to understand love.

1338
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:18,199
So to me, love feels like

1339
01:16:18,282 --> 01:16:20,034
a journey of constant questioning,

1340
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:24,121
reflection, and experiences

1341
01:16:24,205 --> 01:16:25,998
as I search

1342
01:16:27,166 --> 01:16:28,584
for my own answer.

1343
01:16:28,667 --> 01:16:30,169
And I want to make…

1344
01:16:32,755 --> 01:16:34,340
that journey with you.

1345
01:16:36,675 --> 01:16:39,428
I won't vow
that my love will last forever,

1346
01:16:41,347 --> 01:16:43,849
as I wrote it down.

1347
01:16:43,933 --> 01:16:48,646
But there's one promise
I truly want to make.

1348
01:16:51,148 --> 01:16:54,610
I want to go with you to the very end,

1349
01:16:56,153 --> 01:16:58,072
to see what lies beyond this vow of love.

1350
01:16:58,906 --> 01:17:01,033
I will be the husband

1351
01:17:01,117 --> 01:17:03,619
who stands by your side,

1352
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:07,373
who watches us grow
and change beyond our youth

1353
01:17:07,957 --> 01:17:09,083
and who protects you

1354
01:17:10,668 --> 01:17:12,044
until the very end.

1355
01:17:15,798 --> 01:17:16,674
Here.

1356
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:22,680
I…

1357
01:17:24,265 --> 01:17:26,100
I got quite a big ring.

1358
01:17:32,189 --> 01:17:33,524
Will you marry me?

1359
01:19:26,178 --> 01:19:28,847
Do you walk here often?

1360
01:19:28,931 --> 01:19:30,015
Yes.

1361
01:19:31,058 --> 01:19:33,310
When I have things on my mind.

1362
01:19:35,479 --> 01:19:37,231
What was on your mind today?

1363
01:19:37,314 --> 01:19:40,109
I kept thinking about
what the judge said today.

1364
01:19:42,278 --> 01:19:43,612
I did too.

1365
01:19:44,238 --> 01:19:45,447
Having loved before,

1366
01:19:46,407 --> 01:19:48,534
I know how imperfect love can be.

1367
01:19:49,159 --> 01:19:50,327
I've been hurt.

1368
01:19:51,578 --> 01:19:53,163
And I've failed.

1369
01:19:53,831 --> 01:19:57,126
So I thought maybe it would be wiser

1370
01:19:57,209 --> 01:19:59,461
to just meet someone who's a good match

1371
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:03,299
and live a steady, uneventful life

1372
01:20:04,258 --> 01:20:05,551
rather than chase love.

1373
01:20:05,634 --> 01:20:08,137
So that's why you chose
a matchmaking agency.

1374
01:20:11,515 --> 01:20:13,976
Still, you had a good time
with me, didn't you?

1375
01:20:16,103 --> 01:20:17,146
It wasn't bad.

1376
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:19,273
I didn't expect to feel comforted.

1377
01:20:19,356 --> 01:20:21,275
See? I told you it would be good.

1378
01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:29,325
But it's not just you.

1379
01:20:30,492 --> 01:20:32,202
I thought the same way too.

1380
01:20:32,828 --> 01:20:35,289
I thought if I loved less, I'd hurt less.

1381
01:20:35,372 --> 01:20:37,624
So I thought

1382
01:20:37,708 --> 01:20:40,669
that everything might be easier

1383
01:20:40,753 --> 01:20:43,881
if I set love aside
and simply found an adequate match,

1384
01:20:44,506 --> 01:20:48,052
But what the judge said
really hit me to the core.

1385
01:20:49,511 --> 01:20:50,971
In trying to take the easy way,

1386
01:20:51,055 --> 01:20:53,557
I could end up ignoring
the very essence of it all.

1387
01:20:54,892 --> 01:20:55,768
Yes.

1388
01:20:58,854 --> 01:21:03,442
But at the same time,
I understood what you said

1389
01:21:04,151 --> 01:21:07,696
about the essence of marriage
being responsibility.

1390
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:09,281
I guess both are necessary.

1391
01:21:10,074 --> 01:21:11,617
Both love and responsibility.

1392
01:21:13,994 --> 01:21:15,537
But neither is easy.

1393
01:21:16,163 --> 01:21:18,457
I guess that's why people get divorced.

1394
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:20,250
Divorce isn't the end, after all.

1395
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:22,586
Especially this last case we had.

1396
01:21:22,669 --> 01:21:23,712
Right.

1397
01:21:24,421 --> 01:21:27,174
Ms. Park Hyeon-yeong's husband
probably wanted a divorce

1398
01:21:27,257 --> 01:21:29,009
not to end the relationship

1399
01:21:29,093 --> 01:21:32,721
but to start over in a new form.

1400
01:21:33,389 --> 01:21:35,849
I guess divorce isn't a finish line

1401
01:21:36,475 --> 01:21:38,811
but a new starting line.

1402
01:21:42,147 --> 01:21:44,358
I may have lost the trial,
but that was nice.

1403
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:46,318
What do you mean?

1404
01:21:46,402 --> 01:21:49,363
Regardless of the outcome,

1405
01:21:49,446 --> 01:21:52,241
I feel like I've learned
about love in the courtroom.

1406
01:21:52,324 --> 01:21:54,701
The judge's words resonated with me,

1407
01:21:54,785 --> 01:21:59,415
and Mr. Lee's proposal
was the perfect ending.

1408
01:21:59,498 --> 01:22:01,166
You were on the verge of crying.

1409
01:22:03,043 --> 01:22:04,211
"I don't know

1410
01:22:04,294 --> 01:22:07,131
what lies beyond the vow of love."

1411
01:22:08,465 --> 01:22:12,302
When I heard that,
something welled up inside me.

1412
01:22:12,386 --> 01:22:15,180
Honestly, I even get choked up
sometimes at weddings.

1413
01:22:15,264 --> 01:22:17,433
And yet you said all that in court?

1414
01:22:18,725 --> 01:22:21,562
Oh, was that you speaking as a lawyer?

1415
01:22:24,022 --> 01:22:24,898
It was fifty-fifty.

1416
01:22:27,359 --> 01:22:32,197
Like Mr. Lee said,
I'm not sure if I know what love is.

1417
01:22:35,909 --> 01:22:39,496
Still, I've learned a lot
from handling cases at Yullim,

1418
01:22:39,580 --> 01:22:40,497
like I did today.

1419
01:22:40,581 --> 01:22:41,707
What did you learn?

1420
01:22:42,207 --> 01:22:43,083
About love?

1421
01:22:43,792 --> 01:22:45,544
Yes. About love.

1422
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:00,476
<i>The love between a man and a woman.</i>

1423
01:23:01,727 --> 01:23:03,854
- Well done.
- Thank you.

1424
01:23:04,646 --> 01:23:05,731
Thank you.

1425
01:23:17,451 --> 01:23:20,370
<i>The love of parents for their children.</i>

1426
01:23:30,214 --> 01:23:35,552
<i>The love of children for their parents.</i>

1427
01:23:47,523 --> 01:23:48,398
<i>And</i>

1428
01:23:50,067 --> 01:23:51,652
<i>the love between spouses.</i>

1429
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:56,532
I'm sorry.

1430
01:24:21,348 --> 01:24:23,392
<i>Even the love we show to others.</i>

1431
01:24:25,352 --> 01:24:31,191
Thank you for reminding me
that love takes many forms

1432
01:24:31,275 --> 01:24:34,319
and for teaching me

1433
01:24:34,403 --> 01:24:38,282
how to understand and heal the wounds

1434
01:24:40,826 --> 01:24:43,620
that come with it.

1435
01:24:47,457 --> 01:24:49,876
But I still don't really know

1436
01:24:50,877 --> 01:24:53,380
what love truly is.

1437
01:24:58,010 --> 01:24:59,511
What do you think love is?

1438
01:25:04,391 --> 01:25:05,434
Well…

1439
01:25:09,313 --> 01:25:11,356
To me, love is…

01:25:49,227 --> 01:25:52,397
BEYOND THE BAR
