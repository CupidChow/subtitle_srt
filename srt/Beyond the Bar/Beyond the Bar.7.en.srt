1
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:35,953
BEYOND THE BAR

2
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:40,165
TWO YEARS AGO

3
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,287
"25S 2138."

4
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,622
It was 25S 2138.

5
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:24,585
Okay, 25S 2138.

6
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:27,296
I need to call an ambulance.

7
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:31,592
Where did I leave my phone?

8
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,379
Honey!

9
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,549
Are you hurt? Let me see.

10
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:22,643
Let's go inside. Okay?

11
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:25,062
Careful.

12
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:28,732
Ambulance.

13
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,276
That boy.

14
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:35,364
Honey, are you all right?

15
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:36,865
Are you okay? Hey, Honey.

16
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,575
Excuse me. I just…

17
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,879
Don't cry. It's okay.

18
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:00,639
As soon as that boy arrived
at the hospital,

19
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,183
he was declared dead.

20
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:06,103
Based on how his blood had congealed,

21
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:09,064
they suspect he had been left
in that state for about an hour.

22
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,190
DEFENDANT

23
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,150
They say he could've survived

24
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:14,903
with timely emergency care.

25
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:19,616
She said it was her fault
and took it really hard.

26
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:22,744
She said her curse,
her illness, was to blame.

27
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:23,870
I definitely saw it.

28
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:24,830
DETECTIVE UNIT 1

29
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:27,124
It was 25S 2138.

30
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,585
<i>It was a secluded area</i>
<i>with no security cameras nearby.</i>

31
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:32,713
<i>My wife's testimony was all they had.</i>

32
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:33,755
Are you sure?

33
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:35,924
Yes.

34
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,719
<i>She poured all her energy</i>
<i>into catching the culprit.</i>

35
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:41,346
<i>When she was lucid,</i>
<i>she would try to remember what she saw</i>

36
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,515
<i>- and record everything in detail.</i>
- It was 25…

37
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:44,975
<i>She stayed on top of her medication</i>

38
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,185
<i>so that she would be able</i>
<i>to take the witness stand</i>

39
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:48,729
<i>with a clear mind.</i>

40
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:51,565
<i>She made every effort</i>
<i>to stay mentally sharp.</i>

41
00:03:58,488 --> 00:03:59,823
Thanks to her efforts…

42
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,203
that man was apprehended.

43
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,207
<i>Ms. Cha,</i>

44
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:12,586
you just need to answer
the questions the counsel asks you

45
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,212
to the best of your ability.

46
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:16,840
WITNESS

47
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:18,842
We've met a few times.

48
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:22,220
And I've introduced myself every time.
What is my name?

49
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:27,976
That is not important.

50
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,269
It's Yoon Seok-hoon.

51
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:35,484
So, you're saying you wrote the note
as soon as you witnessed the hit-and-run?

52
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:38,904
Yes.

53
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,448
Then why did you not call
an ambulance immediately

54
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:44,326
when you so clearly
witnessed the hit-and-run?

55
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:46,703
- Well, I--
- Had you

56
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:49,039
reported it as soon as you saw it happen,

57
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,791
the victim might have survived, right?

58
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:52,876
- Objection.
- Withdrawn.

59
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:55,170
I was going to report it…

60
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,630
What is my name?

61
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:58,840
I asked you what my name is.

62
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,887
I told you a moment ago.
Did you forget already?

63
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,602
Please answer, Ms. Cha.

64
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,360
The victim was in middle school.

65
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,362
I heard that you were

66
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:23,323
a middle school teacher before
you developed Alzheimer's. Correct?

67
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,158
Yes.

68
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:27,869
So, even at a distance,
you recognized the victim's uniform

69
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:31,206
and figured out
he was in middle school. Is that correct?

70
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:33,542
Yes.

71
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,836
How could a teacher who loves kids

72
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,505
not call an ambulance when she sees a kid

73
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,715
bleeding to death
after being hit by a car?

74
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:43,176
Well,

75
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,930
- I--
- You forgot to call, didn't you?

76
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:49,558
Just like you forgot my name.

77
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,023
Do you see

78
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:59,568
the man in green
and the woman in grey sitting next to him

79
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:01,278
in the gallery over there?

80
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:07,951
Do you recognize them?

81
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:09,578
I heard they were

82
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:12,247
your most treasured students
during your teaching days.

83
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:13,874
Is that correct?

84
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,210
- Yes.
- What are their names?

85
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:22,716
Did you forget them?

86
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,682
You forgot my name,
even after I just mentioned it,

87
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,143
and you forgot the names
of your most treasured students.

88
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,270
You even forgot to call an ambulance.

89
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,147
How can we trust
the testimony of a witness

90
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,274
suffering from such advanced dementia?

91
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:42,861
They're leaving.

92
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,535
In your first testimony, you stated,

93
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:53,288
and I quote, "The hit-and-run driver
was the first perpetrator,

94
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:56,791
and my illness was the second."

95
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,879
To escape the guilt of secondary harm,

96
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:04,466
you wanted the primary perpetrator
to be identified as soon as possible.

97
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:05,717
Isn't that desperate wish,

98
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,553
combined with dementia,
the second perpetrator,

99
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:10,889
leading you to create another victim?

100
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:16,770
Did you ever consider the possibility
that your dementia may be deceiving you?

101
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:32,827
LOVE IN ALL ITS COLORS

102
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:37,123
Next is an announcement
about the performance-based pay system.

103
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:38,083
INCENTIVE PAYOUTS

104
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,627
This new policy will be
implemented going forward.

105
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:45,173
FIXED PAY FOR ADVISORS
AND FORMER OFFICIALS WILL END

106
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:49,010
I am firmly against this.

107
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:50,053
Me too.

108
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:53,014
Ms. Kwon, this is absurd.

109
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:55,225
I mean, you only just took office.

110
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:59,187
How can you change the incentive system
without our consensus?

111
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,398
How could I have sought
consensus on a policy

112
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,317
that puts so many partners
at a disadvantage?

113
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:08,613
And even with that knowledge,
you went ahead with the decision?

114
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:11,741
Then how much longer
are we expected to let this go on?

115
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,702
How long must we watch you
bleed associates dry

116
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:15,412
to offer low fees to your clients?

117
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,957
These fees are being slashed
because clients are retained

118
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,710
not based on merit,
but through personal connections.

119
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:24,004
Then you have the associates
do all the real work.

120
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,965
You call your backroom schmoozing
"karaoke marketing" and "golf marketing."

121
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:31,720
But without doing any real work, you lose
your touch, skills, and even expertise.

122
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:35,015
The only thing left
is to offer lower prices.

123
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:37,017
So you bring in clients
with dirt-cheap rates.

124
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,644
Take a look at our offices at night.

125
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:43,273
Our associates work through the night,
napping on the floor on top of newspapers.

126
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,108
And after all that,
they get no real credit.

127
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,110
If they do work worth 100 million won

128
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,362
but the partner lowballs
the retainer fee to ten million,

129
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,364
they'll be undervalued
and end up with pay cuts.

130
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:53,700
Then why would any associate
stay at this firm?

131
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,995
My goodness,
you've only just become a partner.

132
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,205
Look at you trying to lecture us.

133
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:02,125
Is there no respect for seniors here?

134
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,836
Sir.

135
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:05,962
Shouldn't you do something?

136
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,757
Please offer your insight
as a founding partner.

137
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,341
Jeez. Well…

138
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:12,844
Let's get the titles straight first.

139
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:16,556
Ms. Kwon Na-yeon is the managing partner.
I am the division head.

140
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:21,561
And a law firm isn't
some rigid chain-of-command structure.

141
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:22,854
It is a partnership.

142
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,190
You're a partner. So are you.

143
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,358
You too. And so am I.

144
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,737
Don't pull the "I'm older than you" card.
It's pathetic.

145
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,199
We're in the business of logic.
Let's argue only with logic.

146
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:38,870
Please continue.

147
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:45,376
How many talented associates left
in the second half of last year alone?

148
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,462
That was some Millennial
and Gen Z nonsense.

149
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,297
They wanted work-life balance or whatever.

150
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:53,635
They did not leave for work-life balance.
They left for work-pay balance.

151
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:57,430
They needed their work and pay
to be balanced, not their lives.

152
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:01,684
What drove them out was unfair pay
and a broken performance-based system.

153
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:11,444
I think that about sums it up.
Why don't we wrap it up here?

154
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,239
As long as I'm the managing partner,

155
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,074
the new performance-based
compensation policy

156
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,283
will be implemented.

157
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:19,369
If you have objections,

158
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:21,871
push me out and take this seat.

159
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,749
If there's nothing else, let's wrap it up.

160
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,010
The former officials
just sat back and watched?

161
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:40,056
Yes. Even Mr. Kim took their side.

162
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,015
Hold on.

163
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:44,561
Ms. Kwon couldn't have
come up with this on her own.

164
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:48,106
Right. She has strong legal instincts
but zero political instincts.

165
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,899
Obviously, Yoon Seok-hoon is behind this.

166
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,442
Of course.

167
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,027
"Work-pay balance"?

168
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:57,282
When Kwon Na-yeon was cast aside,
he quietly hid his claws.

169
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:58,783
Then he sweet-talked the geezers

170
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:01,077
into bringing her back
as a managing partner.

171
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:03,204
What's next?

172
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:05,498
Should we start digging up dirt on Yoon?

173
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:07,667
You'd be wasting your time.
He's perfectly clean.

174
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,960
Come on. You never know.

175
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,462
I already have someone on him. Be patient.

176
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:13,047
If we dig deep enough,

177
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:16,718
we're bound to uncover
at least a speck of dirt.

178
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:40,491
Mr. Yoon.

179
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:44,329
Let's go inside first.

180
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,303
What? Isn't this Ms. Seo Hye-jin?

181
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,181
Wow, he's really something else.

182
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:07,143
He acts like he's as pure as snow,
and he's with a second-year?

183
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:09,354
Wait, what's going on here?

184
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,439
Why is Yoon Seok-hoon

185
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:14,525
with Ms. Seo Hye-jin here?

186
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:18,655
Why else would a woman
enter a man's house at midnight?

187
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,907
Our internal harassment prevention policy

188
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,493
clearly states that partners
should refrain from dating

189
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,869
associates or assistants.

190
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:27,914
It was Yoon Seok-hoon
who took the lead to get that passed.

191
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,457
And now, he has violated it.

192
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,669
Who would respect such a hypocrite?

193
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,003
Right.

194
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:36,547
But that won't be enough.

195
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,926
That internal policy can't be enforced
as a disciplinary measure.

196
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:43,388
Getting him for breaching
a recommended policy won't be enough.

197
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:44,430
Then…

198
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,558
Kim Bo‑yun is currently representing
MGC Securities

199
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:49,644
in that mis-selling lawsuit, right?

200
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,437
- Yes.
- And isn't Seo Hye-jin

201
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:52,522
on her team?

202
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,815
Yes, that's right.

203
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,527
They're up against TS Insurance.

204
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,655
TS insisted on Yoon Seok-hoon,

205
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:05,201
so we barely got MGC's consent
and took the case behind an ethical wall.

206
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,495
Really? Then…

207
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:09,998
That's right.

208
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:13,209
"Yoon Seok-hoon engaged
in an improper relationship

209
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,627
with a second-year associate

210
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:18,131
and manipulated her
into giving him sensitive information

211
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,632
detrimental to the opposing party

212
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:22,510
in order to secure an unjust victory."

213
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,178
That's perfect.

214
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:28,057
"With one reckless move,
he dismantled the public's trust

215
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:31,269
in the ethical wall
Yullim had spent years building,

216
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,479
dragging Yullim's reputation
through the mud."

217
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:35,690
"Furthermore, up until now,

218
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:39,652
the public's trust in the ethical wall
that Yullim was able to provide

219
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,487
allowed dual representation

220
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:44,615
through formal procedures,
despite the conflict of interest."

221
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:47,660
"However, he dismantled that trust,
bringing dual representation to a close

222
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:50,538
and undermining the revenue
that it would have generated."

223
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:53,791
So who is going to deliver
this detrimental, sensitive information

224
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,293
to Yoon Seok-hoon?

225
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,213
He reads the room before even walking in,

226
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:01,507
so let's get it done
before he even sees the room.

227
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,634
Let's have a drink.

228
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:16,230
Hello?

229
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,399
I see.

230
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,487
I just got back from Singapore
after attending arbitration at SIAC.

231
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:25,990
I see.

232
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,577
I'll send it
as soon as I get to the office.

233
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:31,120
All right.

234
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:38,461
Are you Mr. Hwang Chung-hyeon?

235
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:40,630
We're with the police.

236
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,131
Okay. And?

237
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:45,760
Mr. Hwang.

238
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,680
You're under arrest for aiding
and abetting the suicide of Cha Yeong-sun.

239
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:50,890
Please come with us.

240
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:55,895
Did you have to go that far?

241
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,021
Yes.

242
00:14:57,647 --> 00:15:01,234
With all due respect to your wife,
I was just doing my job.

243
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:03,236
Excuse me.

244
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:11,911
You have the right to remain silent.
You have the right to an attorney

245
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,496
and the opportunity to defend yourself.

246
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,165
You may request a habeas corpus review.

247
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,333
What's going on here?

248
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:19,127
Who are you?

249
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:22,463
I'm a lawyer.

250
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:24,841
You're…

251
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,261
His wife's younger brother filed
a criminal complaint

252
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:31,597
against Mr. Hwang for aiding
and abetting his wife's suicide.

253
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:33,433
Did his wife commit suicide?

254
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:35,852
Yes.

255
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:39,105
Will you accompany him?

256
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,108
Yes. I'll go down to the station.

257
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,401
I don't need a lawyer.

258
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:47,697
Just be on your way.

259
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,323
I'll just accept my punishment.

260
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:50,950
Let's go.

261
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:10,928
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

262
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:13,431
No, you cannot do that.

263
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,641
I'm already dead inside.

264
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,227
I'm a soulless, empty shell.

265
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:20,480
Yeong-sun.

266
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:22,356
Please.

267
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,027
I promise I'll do better. Please.

268
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:29,447
I'm doing it
because I don't want to hurt you.

269
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:33,284
I could jump off a building
or slit my wrists.

270
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,536
I could even just poison myself.

271
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:38,331
I don't care how it happens,

272
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,375
but you'll have to clean up the mess.

273
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:43,294
Do you think you could live a normal life

274
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,379
after seeing me end up like that?

275
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:53,679
I still want to show you
the best version of me.

276
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:58,684
I don't want you
to be forced to change my diapers.

277
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:04,857
When I die, I want to be at peace
and still have my dignity.

278
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,402
I want to live on in your memory

279
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,406
as the most beautiful version
of myself possible.

280
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,544
Assisted suicide

281
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,964
is legal in Switzerland.

282
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:33,010
Let's make some good memories there
before we say our goodbyes.

283
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:44,063
<i>Assisted suicide?</i>

284
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:47,233
Yes. He assisted
his wife's suicide in Switzerland

285
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:48,818
and got arrested on his way back.

286
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,283
Are you heading out again?

287
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:57,577
I'm going to the detention center
to visit Mr. Hwang.

288
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,162
Are you trying to land the case?

289
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:02,206
He doesn't want representation…

290
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:08,754
I'll pass.

291
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,340
I do appreciate the sentiment.

292
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:12,341
I…

293
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:16,053
believe the hit-and-run lawsuit

294
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:20,766
played a major role in your wife
making that decision.

295
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,685
And even knowing that, you're still here?

296
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,605
What can I do to help you be at ease?

297
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:30,651
It's fine. That's not the issue.

298
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:32,778
Then are you actively seeking
to be punished?

299
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,574
Why? Do you feel guilty?

300
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:41,996
Don't do this.

301
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:45,458
If you do this now, after what you did
out of respect for her decision,

302
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,126
you'd be betraying that very decision.

303
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,587
I accepted the risks
when I made that choice.

304
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,214
I just want to bear

305
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:57,261
the full burden
of that decision myself, without protest.

306
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,894
Reference number 248-13.
Hwang Chung-hyeon.

307
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,605
The defendant's wife
suffered from dementia,

308
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:11,359
and she ended her life by having him
assist in her suicide in Switzerland.

309
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:14,528
The defendant has been criminally reported
by his wife's younger brother

310
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:16,822
and charged
with aiding and abetting suicide.

311
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,325
Have you reviewed the file?

312
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,576
- Yes.
- Yes.

313
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,536
Korean criminal law applies
both the territorial

314
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,663
and nationality principles,

315
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:24,830
so he could be prosecuted.

316
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:28,250
However, there are no reported cases
of companions being prosecuted

317
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,336
upon their return to Korea
after accompanying someone

318
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,962
to an assisted suicide in Switzerland.

319
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:34,590
There have been no prosecutions
based solely on accompaniment,

320
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:37,218
but the defendant is being prosecuted

321
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,970
for actively abetting the suicide
during the process.

322
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:42,139
Supreme Court precedent holds
that abetment includes

323
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:44,809
both active and passive,
material and psychological means,

324
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,227
which encompasses

325
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,729
the lending of suicide tools
like firearms or knives

326
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:50,398
and offering advice or encouragement.

327
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:54,443
Given the defendant's active role,
prosecution seems unavoidable.

328
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:55,486
Any possible arguments?

329
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,822
We might possibly argue
that the act followed social norms

330
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:01,283
and thus qualifies as a justification
that excludes criminal liability.

331
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:06,497
However, there is an unfavorable fact
that undermines this argument.

332
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,540
Which is?

333
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,459
Now that she has passed,
he stands to inherit her estate.

334
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:12,712
- How much?
- It's around 1.7 billion won.

335
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:14,588
Since they didn't have any children,

336
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:17,174
the husband is set to inherit
her estate upon her death.

337
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:20,344
However, if he is convicted,
the inheritance rights would be stripped,

338
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:22,888
and her younger brother
would inherit her estate.

339
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:26,308
That might be why
he filed the criminal complaint.

340
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:28,436
It's not in our favor.

341
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:29,687
There's also

342
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,398
evidence of infidelity.

343
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,441
Infidelity?

344
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:36,110
Yes, it seems to be a recent development.

345
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,570
Jeez…

346
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,826
Draft a brief arguing
that the act justifies exclusion

347
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,077
of criminal liability.

348
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:46,036
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

349
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:51,584
COURT

350
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:55,129
Prosecutor, please state the charges.

351
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:58,132
The defendant has been indicted
under Article 252, Paragraph 2

352
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:00,176
of the Criminal Act
for actively aiding and abetting

353
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:04,972
the suicide of his wife, Cha Yeong-sun,
throughout the entire process,

354
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,932
leading to her death with an injection

355
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:09,393
of a physician-prescribed
euthanasia drug

356
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:11,812
in Switzerland on May 11, 2025.

357
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:15,107
How do you plead to the charges?

358
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,943
The defendant pleads
not guilty to the charges.

359
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,989
How would you describe the relationship
between the defendant

360
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:25,409
and your sister, Ms. Cha Yeong-sun,
before her death?

361
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:27,119
It wasn't good.

362
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:31,248
My sister struggled
with my brother-in-law's infidelity.

363
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:34,960
He even asked her for a divorce
so he could live with his mistress.

364
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:36,212
That was around the time

365
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:40,424
she was diagnosed with dementia.
I believe that led to my brother-in-law

366
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:42,760
withdrawing his divorce request.

367
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,930
She was sick
and would die soon enough anyway.

368
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:48,724
He must have withdrawn it
because he knew

369
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:51,101
if she died as his wife,
he would inherit her estate.

370
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:53,145
Objection. Speculation.

371
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:54,980
I am telling the truth.

372
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:57,858
The only thing that bastard wants
is to inherit my sister's estate

373
00:21:57,942 --> 00:22:00,319
and live it up with his mistress.

374
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:04,406
My poor sister
didn't even have that many years left.

375
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:07,326
But he couldn't even wait that long,

376
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,036
so he manipulated my sister,

377
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:12,206
broke her iron will, and drove her
to suicide under the guise of euthanasia.

378
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,625
Your Honor, please direct
the witness to refrain

379
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:18,337
from speculating on the thoughts of others
that are beyond his knowledge.

380
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:21,966
Mr. Cha, please control yourself.

381
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,718
Did you have an affair?

382
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,596
Yes.

383
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:30,140
When did it start and end?

384
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:35,187
It started about a year
before my wife's diagnosis.

385
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:39,108
After the diagnosis, I ended the affair.

386
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:43,237
Did you ever ask your wife for a divorce?

387
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,782
Yes, the day I asked her for one

388
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:51,787
was the day she told me
about her dementia diagnosis.

389
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:54,790
It hit me like a ton of bricks.

390
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:57,543
It caught me completely off guard.

391
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,211
MEDICAL CERTIFICATE

392
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:00,421
Are you sure?

393
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,548
It could be a misdiagnosis.

394
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:05,134
Did you get a second opinion?

395
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:07,761
Would you expect any less from me?

396
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:10,306
How…

397
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:13,100
You're barely in your mid-forties. How?

398
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:14,768
Fine.

399
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:16,437
Let's get a divorce.

400
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:20,399
- Who cares about that now?
- You asked for one.

401
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,151
No, what I mean is…

402
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,739
Are you going easy on me because I'm sick?

403
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:29,825
Honey, let's just focus
on treatment for now.

404
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:31,410
With all the advancements in medicine--

405
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:32,745
I will take care of myself.

406
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:36,624
Bring me the divorce papers.
I'll sign them.

407
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,544
EARLY SIGNS OF DEMENTIA
IMPAIRED MEMORY

408
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:50,512
Honey? What are you doing out here?

409
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:08,697
I'm sorry.

410
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:09,782
What?

411
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:12,493
You can call it an excuse if you want.

412
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:14,703
I thought about it.

413
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:19,416
And I realize now
it was all because you were sick.

414
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:24,129
I was so petty, and I misjudged you.

415
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:27,007
I think those petty misunderstandings
piled up,

416
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:28,968
and I grew cold as a result.

417
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:32,471
What are you talking about?

418
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:35,474
You're such a stickler
when it comes to plans,

419
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:38,310
but you kept forgetting
the plans you'd make with me.

420
00:24:38,394 --> 00:24:40,562
You would never raise your voice at me,

421
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:43,816
but then you started yelling at me.

422
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:45,901
You stopped answering my questions.

423
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:48,320
You became more irritable.

424
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,199
I didn't know that illness was to blame.

425
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,160
I even had an affair because I was lonely.

426
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:58,539
If I…

427
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:01,792
If I had just paid
a little more attention,

428
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:04,503
we could've discovered it earlier
and gotten you treatment.

429
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:06,922
But I just distanced myself…

430
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:15,723
Come here.

431
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:43,584
What are you doing?

432
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:48,297
When did you get here, Yeong-jin?

433
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,466
What?

434
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:54,053
I guess your brother-in-law
isn't coming home today, either.

435
00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:56,597
He'll be back.

436
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:59,391
He will come back to me.

437
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:03,312
I'm his only home.

438
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,116
See you later.

439
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,911
No kiss for me today?

440
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:20,579
What?

441
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:24,374
Married for less than a year,
and the honeymoon's already over?

442
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:25,959
Come here.

443
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:31,840
When time went backwards for my wife,

444
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,052
it wasn't all bad.

445
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:38,138
I remembered
what we were like as newlyweds

446
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:41,308
and how she used to look at me

447
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:43,268
back then.

448
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,067
Before she got sick, love for me was

449
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:53,737
nothing more than
a one-dimensional, surface-level feeling.

450
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:55,322
But…

451
00:26:56,698 --> 00:27:00,160
I realized something when I started
time traveling with my wife.

452
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:15,884
<i>Love is a rainbow.</i>

453
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:20,931
<i>Love shines through</i>
<i>a colorful spectrum of emotions.</i>

454
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:24,268
<i>Red is passion.</i>

455
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:27,020
<i>Orange is warmth.</i>

456
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,273
Yellow is happiness.

457
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:31,733
Green is peace.

458
00:27:32,276 --> 00:27:36,071
Blue is trust. Indigo is depth.

459
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:39,950
Violet is mystique.

460
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:44,997
<i>I believe my wife and I started with red.</i>

461
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:47,791
<i>And as the years passed,</i>

462
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:50,043
<i>I'm sure our love changed hues.</i>

463
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:54,256
<i>Our love hadn't disappeared</i>
<i>simply because it changed colors.</i>

464
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,216
<i>But I didn't know that back then.</i>

465
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,551
<i>From red,</i>

466
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:01,096
<i>we moved on to orange,</i>

467
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,390
<i>where we felt warmth and content.</i>

468
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:08,812
<i>It kept changing colors,</i>
<i>but it never stopped shining brightly.</i>

469
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:11,815
But I…

470
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:17,863
foolishly believed
it meant the love was gone.

471
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:21,033
When you assisted her suicide,

472
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:24,620
were you in love with your wife?

473
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:28,665
Yes.

474
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:30,792
I loved her.

475
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:36,798
And because I loved her,

476
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:42,554
I respected my wife's decision.

477
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:50,062
As stated in his testimony,

478
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:54,441
the defendant decided to actively assist
in the suicide of Ms. Cha Yeong-sun

479
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:58,153
and abetted her suicide
under the guise of euthanasia.

480
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:00,447
This constitutes the crime
of aiding and abetting suicide

481
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,783
under Article 252, Paragraph 2
of the Criminal Act

482
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,534
and must be punished accordingly.

483
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:07,496
A bill recognizing euthanasia
as assisted dying with dignity

484
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:10,916
has also been recently proposed
to lawmakers.

485
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:14,002
Thus, if the individual expresses
a clear wish for euthanasia,

486
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:16,546
it should not be disregarded.

487
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,924
With the view that such a wish
deserves the utmost respect,

488
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:22,177
a family member's assistance
would be considered

489
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:25,305
a permissible act
under Article 20 of the Criminal Act.

490
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:29,226
We argue that the illegality of the act
should be negated,

491
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:32,396
and we respectfully request
that the defendant be acquitted.

492
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:34,481
Your Honor.

493
00:29:34,982 --> 00:29:38,485
This case involves active euthanasia,
in which an individual

494
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:41,655
directly administers
a prescribed drug to achieve death.

495
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:43,657
She was not suffering physical pain.

496
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,827
She was seeking to avoid dementia,
a neuropsychiatric condition.

497
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:50,539
How can we view a husband aiding
his wife's euthanasia due to dementia

498
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:53,166
as an act that isn't
contrary to social norms?

499
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:57,087
Your Honor, dementia inflicts pain

500
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,673
that cuts just as deep
as a physical wound.

501
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:01,550
Especially for someone like Ms. Cha,

502
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,386
who was always revered by her students

503
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,179
and members of her community,

504
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:09,891
that pain must have been
even more insufferable.

505
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:12,728
The prosecution acknowledging
only physical pain

506
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:16,106
and dismissing mental pain

507
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:19,109
is exceedingly simplistic in thought,
grounded in an obsolete worldview.

508
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:23,113
Furthermore, the defendant
is Ms. Cha's primary heir

509
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:26,491
and has even committed adultery.

510
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:30,787
He had ample motive
to abet Ms. Cha's suicide.

511
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:33,957
The argument that he abetted
the suicide for an inheritance

512
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:38,003
is nothing more than a baseless claim
made by the prosecution.

513
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:40,255
Furthermore, we ask the court
to fully consider

514
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:42,382
that the defendant's affair,
in view of its timing,

515
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:44,426
is unrelated to the events of this case.

516
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,510
All right.

517
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:48,263
The court has heard both arguments.

518
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:51,683
Prosecutor,
your sentencing recommendation, please.

519
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:54,978
We request a three-year prison sentence
for the defendant.

520
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:00,817
COURT IN SESSION

521
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:04,279
In light of the various circumstances
claimed by the defendant,

522
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:07,616
we could infer that the defendant
decided to assist in his wife's suicide

523
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:12,079
because he truly loved and cared for her.

524
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:15,665
However, if we begin
to apply the law selectively

525
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:18,460
out of sympathy for individual hardships,

526
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:21,963
it could ultimately lead to the erosion

527
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:25,801
of the principles of equity
and justice in society.

528
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:28,303
Thus, the defendant must also be subject

529
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:31,181
to the same legal standards.

530
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:35,185
Under current criminal law,
aiding and abetting a person's suicide

531
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:40,399
is prohibited, even if the deceased
made an explicit request.

532
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:42,275
The court will now rule.

533
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:46,238
The court hereby sentences the defendant
to one year of imprisonment.

534
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:29,865
Yeon-a.

535
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:34,244
You know I like you a lot, right?

536
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:36,997
Well…

537
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:42,085
I'm ready for this.

538
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:43,795
I hear you,

539
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:47,299
but you can't keep showing up like this.

540
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:02,772
I want a divorce.

541
00:33:02,856 --> 00:33:04,232
What's gotten into you?

542
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:06,526
I don't love you anymore.

543
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:09,779
You don't make my heart flutter
or excite me anymore.

544
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:13,366
I don't feel anything anymore.

545
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:15,368
Do you think that justifies divorce?

546
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,829
We haven't been intimate in over a year.

547
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,582
You were busy too.

548
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:23,084
You kept a distance, so I…

549
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:26,880
I just thought we needed some time.

550
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:28,924
If that's the issue, I'll try harder.

551
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:30,884
I can't live like this.

552
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,385
I just can't continue living

553
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,055
this dry, loveless life.

554
00:33:36,306 --> 00:33:39,226
You saw me that night, didn't you?

555
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:41,102
I saw you too.

556
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:46,066
Even when you saw that man

557
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:48,944
take me in his arms, you just turned away.

558
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:52,197
I don't want to blame you
for someone else's one-sided feelings.

559
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:54,783
Don't feel guilty.

560
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:55,742
I trust you.

561
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:57,786
I've done nothing to feel guilty about.

562
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,120
I have no feelings for him.

563
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:01,289
- I know.
- But…

564
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,460
I also didn't push him away.

565
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:11,424
Looking at him felt like
I was looking at you from ten years ago.

566
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:15,262
The look in his eyes, that passion…

567
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:20,767
It's the you from ten years ago
that I miss so much.

568
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,394
Love isn't just about passion.

569
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:26,690
This level of content we've reached
after all our struggles is also love.

570
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:32,195
It feels like this listlessness
is eating away at me every day.

571
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:35,156
I admit the emotions we felt
at the beginning have faded,

572
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,034
but they've been replaced by new feelings.

573
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:42,289
Seeing someone as your family,
your person,

574
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:46,710
and someone you want
to lean on and rely on is also love.

575
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:53,675
I'm going to stay
at my parents' for a bit.

576
00:34:54,718 --> 00:34:55,885
Yeon-a.

577
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:03,977
It's me.

578
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,564
Can we meet up?

579
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:16,906
What's going on?

580
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:24,789
Since the divorce,
you've never been the one who reaches out.

581
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:27,125
Did something happen?

582
00:35:30,587 --> 00:35:31,630
Today,

583
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:37,594
this man who assisted in the suicide
of his wife with dementia said something.

584
00:35:38,345 --> 00:35:39,804
He said love is a rainbow.

585
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:45,644
Love isn't just red.

586
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:50,106
The love that we once shared

587
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:55,028
just changed into different colors
as time passed.

588
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,323
But it didn't stop being love

589
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:01,993
just because it was a different color.

590
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:03,286
I know that.

591
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:05,330
I know I was wrong.

592
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:08,166
- You do?
- Yes.

593
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:11,586
I know now.

594
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,090
I'm sorry I didn't realize that
when I was with you.

595
00:36:16,383 --> 00:36:19,219
I'm sorry I only realized it with Won-jun.

596
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,389
I was inexperienced with love back then.

597
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,892
I didn't understand
because I was too immature.

598
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:42,659
You can stop making me cologne and soap.

599
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,036
And Hash…

600
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:50,041
Check him in at the hotel on time.
Don't be early or late.

601
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:54,045
Let's never cross paths again.

602
00:36:57,257 --> 00:36:58,466
Seok-hoon.

603
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,799
Over here.

604
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:43,595
Are you incapable of eating alone?

605
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:46,097
I was at work.
Do you know how many times you called me?

606
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:47,682
You have something to tell me.

607
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:49,893
- I do?
- Yeah.

608
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:52,729
I can't think of anything.

609
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,981
The story of your life before we met.

610
00:37:56,149 --> 00:37:59,235
Just forget it.
Can we get a bottle of soju and a beer?

611
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:01,529
- Coming.
- You must have been itching for a drink.

612
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:04,032
- I'm so hungry.
- You are?

613
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,992
- Wait. It's almost ready.
- Start with the rinds.

614
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:07,452
Okay. The rinds first. Got it.

615
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:09,788
It's almost ready.

616
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:12,749
Cheers.

617
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,670
Come on. Tell me the story.

618
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:20,882
What's this story you keep going on about?

619
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,383
One more bottle of soju, please.

620
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:24,719
That's enough.
You're a total lightweight anyway.

621
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:27,347
Yeah, I'm done drinking. It's for you.

622
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,348
I'm already drunk.

623
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:30,058
No, you're not there yet.

624
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:33,561
When you're drunk,
the stories just flow out of you.

625
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:36,564
I…

626
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:39,150
have always been curious

627
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:45,740
about the sort of experiences
that made you the person you are today.

628
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:51,120
I've always found it amazing.

629
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:54,207
- What?
- It's just…

630
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:58,002
You get excited about everything like
it's your first time experiencing things.

631
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:01,381
You were like a teenage girl.

632
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:04,551
What sort of law firm

633
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:06,678
has a workshop at an amusement park?

634
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,891
Hey, Heo Min-jeong.

635
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:13,893
I'm so excited. Hurry up. Come on!

636
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:15,770
Only teenagers wear stuff like this.

637
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:17,605
- Hurry up!
- This is insane.

638
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:32,579
<i>Watching you light up like it was</i>
<i>your first time at an amusement park</i>

639
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:38,209
<i>made me wonder what kind of life</i>
<i>kept you from such simple joys.</i>

640
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:48,469
That was really
my first time doing all that.

641
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:53,808
In my teens, I studied my butt off
to make life easier for my mom.

642
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:56,644
In my twenties and thirties,

643
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,980
I was robbed of my time.

644
00:39:59,606 --> 00:40:03,192
In my late thirties,
I was scrambling to turn my life around,

645
00:40:03,276 --> 00:40:05,486
and then I met you in my forties.

646
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:08,948
Come to think of it,
I should really thank you.

647
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:11,534
I never would've had
the courage to do it alone.

648
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:13,119
I got to experience so many things.

649
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:15,371
Thanks, Jin-woo.

650
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:19,417
You are much too kind.
I should be thanking you.

651
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:24,297
Stuff that had become
excruciatingly boring and repetitive

652
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:26,883
became fun

653
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:29,135
when I was with you.

654
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:32,931
YOON SEOK‑HOON

655
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:38,686
- It's Mr. Yoon.
- Why is he calling?

656
00:40:39,312 --> 00:40:40,188
I know, right?

657
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:48,655
Come on.

658
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:49,614
Bro!

659
00:40:51,658 --> 00:40:52,867
You didn't have to run over.

660
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:55,119
For the first time ever,
you told me you missed me.

661
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:58,081
I had to run over.
I would've flown over if I had wings.

662
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:59,958
I came too. Hope that's okay.

663
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:01,542
Of course.

664
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,837
- Are you drunk?
- No, not yet.

665
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:07,340
I'm just a little drunk, Mr. Yoon.

666
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:09,759
Wait!

667
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:11,719
It's your first time
drinking together, right?

668
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:15,515
You two kept missing team dinners.
You never attended together, right?

669
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:18,434
No, we did when I was a paralegal.

670
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:20,645
Paralegal? When?

671
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:22,814
I worked part-time
when I was in law school.

672
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,857
What? Is this part of your secret past?

673
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:26,359
Yes.

674
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:28,861
You're unbelievable.

675
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:32,073
I knew you were way too good
at your job for a first-year.

676
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:34,701
Wait, then you knew?

677
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:36,661
Of course he did.

678
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,621
He was a pivotal figure in my past.

679
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:40,123
- Really?
- Yeah.

680
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:44,002
I became a lawyer thanks to Mr. Yoon.

681
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:45,420
What?

682
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,714
He supported me throughout law school.

683
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,968
He pulled me out of the gutter.

684
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,804
My dad passed when I was little,

685
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:58,307
and my mom went through hell
to send me to a top university.

686
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:03,938
As soon as I got admitted into one,
I had a kid with the wrong guy.

687
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:06,816
I put up with all sorts of verbal abuse,

688
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:10,028
scorn, and contempt
from my husband and in-laws,

689
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:13,281
but what finally broke me

690
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:16,492
was when my own daughter
began to disrespect me.

691
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:19,704
I wanted to get revenge.

692
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:24,542
No, I think I needed
to voice the injustice I felt.

693
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,711
So I went to meet a lawyer,

694
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:28,796
and it was Mr. Kim Yul-seong.

695
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,591
You two have quite a long history.

696
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:35,678
And that was also the day
I met my savior.

697
00:42:35,762 --> 00:42:39,432
Are you saying Mr. Kim was your savior?

698
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:41,184
No.

699
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,519
The lawyer who was next to him.

700
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:46,022
Him?

701
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:51,527
You know how Mr. Kim is.

702
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:54,197
When it seemed like
I couldn't pay the fee,

703
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,531
he quietly backed out.

704
00:42:56,449 --> 00:43:00,995
But Mr. Yoon listened to my story
and stepped in to help.

705
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:03,748
While I burned for revenge,
he told me this.

706
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:07,001
Could I please…

707
00:43:07,877 --> 00:43:11,297
Could I please pay you
the retainer fee later?

708
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:21,933
The greatest revenge you can take
on people living in the gutter

709
00:43:23,893 --> 00:43:25,353
is just leaving them behind.

710
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:30,691
If you need help,

711
00:43:32,527 --> 00:43:34,695
I'll help you get out of there.

712
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:44,372
- Isn't that cool?
- Totally. So cool.

713
00:43:44,914 --> 00:43:48,251
Whenever I think about those days,
I'm always on the verge of tears.

714
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:49,710
Mr. Yoon. Cheers.

715
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:51,963
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

716
00:43:52,505 --> 00:43:54,549
To the gutters!

717
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,134
Where'd you get that from?

718
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:24,829
Way to go, Ms. Kang.

719
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:28,082
You really know
how to write up an incredible brief.

720
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:31,043
You're more than fit to be my protégé.

721
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:34,964
Not at all.

722
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:37,300
It's all because you taught me so well.

723
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:40,636
No, you're just that good, Ms. Kang.

724
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,430
That's why I refer to you as an attorney

725
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:44,390
and not just by your name.

726
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:47,810
It's all thanks to you.

727
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:49,770
- Are you almost done?
- Oh my gosh!

728
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:53,065
Mr. Yoon.

729
00:44:56,903 --> 00:44:58,613
How long have you been there?

730
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:00,656
From the beginning.

731
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:03,451
What are you doing here this late?

732
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:09,290
I didn't want to go home.

733
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:12,126
Why? Is something terrible
waiting for you at home?

734
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:16,505
No, it's because
there is nothing waiting for me.

735
00:45:20,009 --> 00:45:22,345
Would you like a cup of tea?

736
00:45:30,645 --> 00:45:32,063
Is there something wrong?

737
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:37,902
You might feel better
if you talk about it.

738
00:45:38,778 --> 00:45:39,904
It worked for me

739
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:42,657
when I told you about my mom.

740
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:49,163
It's hard to explain.

741
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:50,748
I doubt it.

742
00:45:51,249 --> 00:45:54,669
There's nothing
a master wordsmith like you can't explain.

743
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:57,171
You always just listen to my stories.

744
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:59,548
I'm a good listener too, you know.

745
00:46:00,049 --> 00:46:01,592
Give me a chance.

746
00:46:09,392 --> 00:46:10,476
My ex-wife and I…

747
00:46:12,979 --> 00:46:16,399
dated for three years and got divorced
after seven years of marriage.

748
00:46:17,984 --> 00:46:20,152
She got remarried after a few years.

749
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:22,613
She's even pregnant now.

750
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,832
In my freshman year of high school,

751
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:35,876
there was a kid
who was a pathological liar.

752
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,129
I'm pretty good at reading people,

753
00:46:39,005 --> 00:46:40,548
so he couldn't trick me.

754
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:44,010
He didn't cause any real trouble,
so I just let him be.

755
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:46,137
But one day,

756
00:46:47,138 --> 00:46:48,889
he struck a nerve.

757
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:51,309
Being able to see into someone's heart

758
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:55,563
means you can figure out
their greatest weakness.

759
00:46:56,272 --> 00:46:57,481
And if things turn sour,

760
00:46:58,691 --> 00:47:01,235
you can go straight
for the jugular without mercy.

761
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:02,987
So…

762
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:06,157
I did just that.

763
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:33,601
<i>That day,</i>

764
00:47:35,436 --> 00:47:39,023
I realized how powerful
words can be as a weapon.

765
00:47:40,191 --> 00:47:42,443
So naturally, I started talking less.

766
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:45,613
But I wasn't like that with my ex-wife.

767
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:49,116
We talked about our daily lives,

768
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:52,286
shared our feelings,

769
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:53,913
and sometimes

770
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:56,999
chatted about meaningless things.

771
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:00,252
Emotionally, I was done after the divorce,

772
00:48:00,336 --> 00:48:03,714
but it felt like who she was then
and the woman she was before

773
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:07,385
were two completely different people.

774
00:48:08,177 --> 00:48:10,388
I easily let go
of who she was when we divorced

775
00:48:10,471 --> 00:48:11,972
but could not let go

776
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:15,101
of who she used to be.

777
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:19,397
I missed talking to that woman so much

778
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:23,692
that I used to talk to myself
as if she were right in front of me.

779
00:48:24,193 --> 00:48:25,277
Like a madman.

780
00:48:30,825 --> 00:48:31,700
But today…

781
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:36,997
it feels like even that woman

782
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:42,086
has disappeared into thin air.

783
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:47,508
You've let go of everything,

784
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:50,845
and your heart feels hollow
because all that remains

785
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:52,680
is an empty space, right?

786
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:57,184
Probably.

787
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,105
You have a big house, right?

788
00:49:02,523 --> 00:49:05,901
You came here because
that big, empty house only amplifies

789
00:49:05,985 --> 00:49:07,361
your emptiness, right?

790
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:11,198
Probably.

791
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:15,744
The only thing
that can't be replaced in this world

792
00:49:16,412 --> 00:49:17,955
is yourself.

793
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:23,544
Even that person from your past
can eventually be replaced.

794
00:49:25,421 --> 00:49:26,297
Is that so?

795
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:28,132
Yes.

796
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:31,343
That empty feeling
will also disappear in no time.

797
00:49:31,427 --> 00:49:34,013
You can deny it all you want,
but time heals all wounds.

798
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:37,516
They say emotions can't withstand
the weathering of time

799
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:41,729
and that time erases even its own traces.

800
00:49:43,898 --> 00:49:44,857
Wise words.

801
00:49:48,903 --> 00:49:51,280
I should take a walk and sober up a bit.

802
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:53,032
Okay.

803
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:56,076
Attorney Kang Hyo-min.

804
00:49:56,869 --> 00:49:58,078
Yes?

805
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:02,708
Thank you.

806
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:04,376
Sure.

807
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:08,797
Sir.

808
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:13,552
See you tomorrow.

809
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:16,222
Yes. See you tomorrow.

810
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:32,196
- Look at you putting on those slippers.
- My slippers…

811
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,114
Just go now.

812
00:50:35,324 --> 00:50:37,326
I told you I could get home by myself.

813
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:39,828
Why must you be so extra?

814
00:50:39,912 --> 00:50:43,499
Extra? Come on.
It's time I return the favor.

815
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:46,418
You always get me home safely.

816
00:50:48,671 --> 00:50:51,006
Fine. Go home now.

817
00:50:51,549 --> 00:50:53,259
Bye. Thanks, Jin-woo.

818
00:50:53,342 --> 00:50:54,927
Where are you going?

819
00:50:56,804 --> 00:50:58,305
Wait, stop!

820
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,183
I didn't see anything.

821
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:09,984
My head hurts so much.

822
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:17,658
Oh gosh.

823
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:19,785
What's wrong with you?
Why are you still here?

824
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:22,329
How can you ask me to leave at this hour?

825
00:51:22,413 --> 00:51:24,290
I'm just going to sleep on this couch.

826
00:51:24,373 --> 00:51:26,584
- Hey!
- My place is too far away.

827
00:51:26,667 --> 00:51:28,168
And I'm a bit drunk.

828
00:51:28,252 --> 00:51:31,171
If I take a cab,
I could fall asleep inside the car.

829
00:51:31,255 --> 00:51:33,799
The world is a scary place,
even for men nowadays.

830
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,676
Fine.

831
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:38,262
Do whatever you want.

832
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:42,182
Jeez, it's so cold in here.

833
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:46,270
I guess I'll just freeze to death.
Your place is so cold.

834
00:51:48,022 --> 00:51:49,106
So cold…

835
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:50,316
- Gosh…
- Here.

836
00:51:52,693 --> 00:51:53,694
Thank you.

837
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:55,279
- I'm going to bed.
- Thank you.

838
00:51:56,155 --> 00:51:57,364
Good night.

839
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:03,662
So plush.

840
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:35,653
Mom!

841
00:52:36,195 --> 00:52:38,238
You're up? Go and get washed up.

842
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:40,324
When did you get here?

843
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:43,160
<i>Doenjang </i>stew!

844
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:45,829
I've been craving your <i>doenjang </i>stew.

845
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:47,498
- Did you now?
- Yeah.

846
00:52:48,457 --> 00:52:50,668
Did the guy sleeping here leave?

847
00:52:53,045 --> 00:52:56,048
I guess he did.
He should've stayed for breakfast.

848
00:52:57,383 --> 00:52:59,009
Did I tell you about Jin-woo?

849
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:00,761
He's an associate I work with--

850
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:02,554
Go and get washed up.

851
00:53:02,638 --> 00:53:04,848
Fine. I'm going.

852
00:53:04,932 --> 00:53:07,142
Let me just enjoy
your smell for a bit longer.

853
00:53:07,226 --> 00:53:10,521
- Ridiculous.
- So nice…

854
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:14,817
Goodness.

855
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:20,364
How can a 20-year-old woman
still be such a baby?

856
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:23,784
Did you say 20?
Don't you know your own daughter's age?

857
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:26,412
I'm already 42.

858
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:35,838
Right.

859
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:39,967
I'm 42.

860
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:43,053
And my mom…

861
00:53:45,848 --> 00:53:47,850
passed away when I was 23.

862
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:51,854
Mom.

863
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:58,152
Is this a dream, then?

864
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:01,655
Mom.

865
00:54:04,742 --> 00:54:06,535
Is this really just a dream?

866
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:08,829
Mom.

867
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,832
Is this just a dream?

868
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:14,251
Mom.

869
00:54:14,752 --> 00:54:17,004
Mom.

870
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:19,047
Mom…

871
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:21,675
Mom.

872
00:54:22,176 --> 00:54:24,595
Mom.

873
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:25,679
Mom.

874
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:29,933
Mom!

875
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:05,427
Min-jeong, what's wrong?

876
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:07,137
What happened?

877
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:09,556
What's wrong? Are you okay?

878
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:12,142
What's the matter? What happened?

879
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:16,772
Who said you could come into my room?

880
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:19,566
Well, you were crying…

881
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:23,362
- Are you okay?
- Just go and sleep.

882
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:25,280
Do you want me to stay with you?

883
00:55:25,906 --> 00:55:27,991
- What?
- Should I sleep next to you?

884
00:55:28,075 --> 00:55:29,326
Are you kidding me?

885
00:55:30,911 --> 00:55:33,497
I promise I won't try anything.
I'll just sleep.

886
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:35,582
Leave already.

887
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:39,169
Just seeing you cry makes me a bit upset.

888
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:41,630
I'm the one crying.
Why would you be upset?

889
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:44,132
I don't know. It's just…

890
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:48,470
I guess seeing someone who never cries
cry with so much sorrow

891
00:55:49,263 --> 00:55:50,973
made me a bit upset.

892
00:55:53,517 --> 00:55:55,853
You're so annoying.

893
00:55:55,936 --> 00:55:57,563
Jeez.

894
00:55:57,646 --> 00:56:00,232
Gosh.

895
00:56:24,882 --> 00:56:26,341
CONFIDENTIAL: MGC SECURITIES

896
00:56:28,552 --> 00:56:29,970
INVESTMENT STRUCTURE AND BACKGROUND

897
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:31,763
CONFIDENTIAL: KEY RISK ANALYSIS

898
00:56:32,431 --> 00:56:33,348
What is this?

899
00:56:33,432 --> 00:56:34,683
What?

900
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:37,144
- Why is this in here?
- What is it?

901
00:56:37,978 --> 00:56:42,024
This looks like an internal review file
for the defendant, MGC Securities.

902
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:43,275
What are you talking about?

903
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:45,986
It was just stuck in between.
Why do we have this?

904
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:48,030
Wait, what is this?

905
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:50,240
Isn't this the opponent's classified file?

906
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:54,494
I think a file meant for Ms. Kim's team
got sent to us by mistake.

907
00:56:54,578 --> 00:56:56,580
That's not possible.

908
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:58,916
- Come on.
- That would be serious.

909
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:00,751
We've set up an ethical wall.

910
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:04,212
Right, so why is this here with us?

911
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:07,424
Hold on. What's this number?

912
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:12,220
It seems different from the one
that was supplied to our client.

913
00:57:12,304 --> 00:57:14,389
The sensitivity analysis is different.

914
00:57:14,473 --> 00:57:15,515
Goodness.

915
00:57:18,185 --> 00:57:22,064
The internal report for the defendant,
MGC, contains a different analysis.

916
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:23,231
Yes.

917
00:57:23,315 --> 00:57:25,525
The defendant determined
that a key investment risk

918
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:28,070
was that the recoverability of principal
and interest at maturity

919
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:30,238
greatly affects
the spark spread of the power plant.

920
00:57:30,322 --> 00:57:31,907
PROFITABILITY METRIC FOR GAS POWER PLANTS

921
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:35,535
The internal review advised
against using their own funds,

922
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:37,287
but they used the plaintiff's funds.

923
00:57:37,371 --> 00:57:40,582
If the defendant knowingly
and intentionally hid

924
00:57:40,666 --> 00:57:42,501
the investment risks…

925
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:43,877
Their primary claim could seek

926
00:57:43,961 --> 00:57:47,089
contract termination
on the grounds of fraud or mistake.

927
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:49,007
Fraudulent misdealing could also be cited.

928
00:57:49,091 --> 00:57:52,260
The breach of investor protection duties
can be the secondary claim.

929
00:57:52,344 --> 00:57:55,222
Breach of investor protection duty alone
wasn't likely to succeed,

930
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:56,348
but with this data,

931
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:59,643
we have a good chance of winning,
even if the fraud is dismissed.

932
00:58:00,769 --> 00:58:03,271
But how did such a confidential file

933
00:58:03,355 --> 00:58:05,107
end up in our pile?

934
00:58:05,649 --> 00:58:08,276
Should I look into where it leaked from?

935
00:58:09,236 --> 00:58:10,320
No.

936
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:14,366
Maybe we should just check…

937
00:58:14,992 --> 00:58:16,785
Include the internal review report
in the brief

938
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:19,162
and update the grounds of claims.
Circulate them internally,

939
00:58:19,246 --> 00:58:21,999
but keep it classified
from the clients and outsiders.

940
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:24,126
Mr. Yoon.

941
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:27,295
Using the opponent's confidential file
in this manner feels wrong.

942
00:58:27,379 --> 00:58:30,298
- In a conflict-of-interest situation--
- Revise the brief.

943
00:58:30,382 --> 00:58:32,134
- Yes, sir.
- Understood.

944
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:33,885
You may leave.

945
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:54,364
Damn it.

PREPARATORY BRIEF

952
00:59:19,848 --> 00:59:22,434
Well done.
Your partner review is next year, right?

953
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:23,393
Yes, sir.

954
00:59:24,144 --> 00:59:27,064
- I'll give it my all.
- Well done.

955
00:59:27,147 --> 00:59:28,732
You can leave now. We just need to…

956
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:30,567
Right. See you around.

957
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:33,028
Sure.

958
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:37,949
Look at this.

959
00:59:38,033 --> 00:59:40,744
Yoon Seok-hoon
is more naive than I expected.

960
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:42,329
He shouldn't be this easy to catch.

961
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:44,790
That man is just so competitive.

962
00:59:44,873 --> 00:59:46,291
I knew he'd bite immediately.

963
00:59:46,374 --> 00:59:47,459
- Really?
- Yes.

964
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:49,294
Should we call a partner meeting now?

965
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:51,171
Sure, I guess.

966
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:52,672
When we get rid of Yoon Seok-hoon,

967
00:59:52,756 --> 00:59:54,716
we should get rid of
all his underlings too.

968
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:57,928
Especially that new girl.
She's been getting on my nerves.

969
00:59:58,011 --> 01:00:00,263
- Who?
- Her name's Kang Hyo-min.

970
01:00:00,347 --> 01:00:01,807
Oh, top-of-her-class at SNU Law?

971
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:06,103
Who cares if she was top of her class?
She's a wild menace.

972
01:00:06,186 --> 01:00:08,897
Are you that worked up about one newbie?

973
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:12,859
You know, you're particularly harsh
with the female associates.

974
01:00:12,943 --> 01:00:15,779
It's still better than being
romantically involved with one.

975
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:17,280
I guess you're right.

976
01:00:17,823 --> 01:00:20,659
The one thing I don't have
to worry about with you is women.

977
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:21,618
You know?

978
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:22,911
Yes, right…

979
01:00:23,495 --> 01:00:27,040
But still, try to be a little nicer.
Don't come down too hard on them.

980
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:29,709
You don't know this?

981
01:00:29,793 --> 01:00:33,130
Tell Heo Min-jeong to get out here now!

982
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:36,216
You need to make an appointment.

983
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:37,384
Heo Min-jeong!

984
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:39,511
- Mom…
- Get out here now!

985
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:40,887
Let's just go.

986
01:00:40,971 --> 01:00:44,057
We got divorced seven years ago.
What are you trying to do here?

987
01:00:47,853 --> 01:00:48,812
My goodness.

988
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:51,565
I had my doubts,

989
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:54,317
but it's like you were reborn.

990
01:00:54,401 --> 01:00:55,652
Can I help you with something?

991
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:59,239
That's all you can say
to your mother-in-law after all this time?

992
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:01,700
Mother-in-law? And who would that be?

993
01:01:03,034 --> 01:01:06,329
Just listen to how this obnoxious bitch
talks to me.

994
01:01:06,413 --> 01:01:08,039
Again, can I help you?

995
01:01:08,123 --> 01:01:12,210
It's not something to discuss
standing here like this.

996
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:15,380
Let's go and sit down somewhere.

997
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:16,673
We can just talk here.

998
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:21,803
I mean,

999
01:01:21,887 --> 01:01:24,264
if anyone's going
to be publicly disgraced here,

1000
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:26,349
it would be you.

1001
01:01:27,434 --> 01:01:29,227
Not at all. Please go ahead.

1002
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:33,857
Why didn't you tell us
you became a lawyer?

1003
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:37,027
You came to argue about that?

1004
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:38,403
That brat with no pedigree

1005
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:42,574
is trying to team up with you and ruin us.

1006
01:01:42,657 --> 01:01:44,242
Wicked little witches.

1007
01:01:44,326 --> 01:01:45,493
I'm afraid I don't follow.

1008
01:01:45,577 --> 01:01:46,786
My wife said

1009
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:50,207
she wants you to represent her
for the divorce.

1010
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:53,501
Yes. She came and asked. I told her no.

1011
01:01:53,585 --> 01:01:57,631
We're going to need you to pay us back
for all the money we spent

1012
01:01:57,714 --> 01:01:59,549
on your tuition
and living expenses back then.

1013
01:01:59,633 --> 01:02:04,554
Thanks to us, you graduated from college,
went to law school, and became a lawyer.

1014
01:02:04,638 --> 01:02:07,182
You should compensate us for that,
don't you think?

1015
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:11,770
I heard your family was in ruins.
Are you here to beg for money?

1016
01:02:12,938 --> 01:02:16,107
- I mean…
- How dare you run that mouth!

1017
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:19,194
Why you little--

1018
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:21,821
- Did you just hit me?
- My goodness.

1019
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:23,740
Hey!

1020
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:26,159
She must have lost her mind.

1021
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:28,370
- Please call security.
- Yes, ma'am.

1022
01:02:28,954 --> 01:02:30,956
- And the police as well.
- Yes, ma'am.

1023
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:35,877
Leave.

1024
01:02:36,544 --> 01:02:38,171
Before things get worse for you.

1025
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:39,297
Watch it!

1026
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:41,716
You're just some damn orphan

1027
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:44,511
who ensnared my successful son
and had a child out of wedlock!

1028
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:48,139
This is the thanks we get
for taking you in?

1029
01:02:49,557 --> 01:02:51,268
Goodness!

1030
01:02:51,351 --> 01:02:52,811
Same old script, I see.

1031
01:02:54,312 --> 01:02:55,939
You're laughing? Why you little…

1032
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:58,858
Are you even guarding the building at all?

1033
01:02:58,942 --> 01:03:01,861
What's the point of having security
if you're just going to let

1034
01:03:01,945 --> 01:03:03,154
this riff-raff disrupt work?

1035
01:03:03,238 --> 01:03:05,782
What? "Riff-raff"?

1036
01:03:05,865 --> 01:03:07,033
My apologies.

1037
01:03:07,701 --> 01:03:09,244
- Drag them out.
- Yes, ma'am.

1038
01:03:09,828 --> 01:03:10,870
This way.

1039
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:13,623
- Where is the police?
- Should I call them again?

1040
01:03:13,707 --> 01:03:15,875
Yes, report them
for obstruction of business.

1041
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:18,753
Let go of me! I can leave on my own!

1042
01:03:21,089 --> 01:03:22,132
You want money?

1043
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:24,467
My mom sent me to college.

1044
01:03:24,551 --> 01:03:27,178
And at most,
you paid for a year's worth of tuition.

1045
01:03:27,262 --> 01:03:28,513
"Living expenses"?

1046
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:33,351
Shall I calculate and bill you
for 14 years of forced domestic labor

1047
01:03:33,435 --> 01:03:35,145
with five hours of sleep per day?

1048
01:03:36,688 --> 01:03:37,814
If you ever visit me again,

1049
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:40,233
I will destroy you all.

1050
01:04:05,425 --> 01:04:07,177
- Are you okay?
- What do you mean?

1051
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:09,596
That fight earlier with your ex-husband.

1052
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:11,014
Why would I not be okay?

1053
01:04:11,639 --> 01:04:12,557
You were really cool.

1054
01:04:15,894 --> 01:04:17,270
- Do you have plans today?
- Why?

1055
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:18,521
Should we have dinner?

1056
01:04:18,605 --> 01:04:19,898
I'm watching what I eat.

1057
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:22,317
Really? Me too.
I want to lose some weight.

1058
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:25,236
I know a good salad place nearby.
How about some salad?

1059
01:04:25,737 --> 01:04:27,197
No.

1060
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,865
Then what about
that soup and rice place

1061
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:30,825
- we used to go--
- No.

1062
01:04:36,915 --> 01:04:38,500
Why do you keep wasting time on me?

1063
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:39,542
What?

1064
01:04:39,626 --> 01:04:42,379
Aren't you going to get married?
Do you have infinite time or something?

1065
01:04:42,462 --> 01:04:44,255
What's the point of having a meal with me?

1066
01:04:44,339 --> 01:04:47,342
Go out and date. If that doesn't work,
have someone set you up.

1067
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:50,845
Why waste precious time eating with me?

1068
01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:30,760
I'm so upset.

1069
01:05:32,637 --> 01:05:34,597
What kind of sad dream did you have?

1070
01:05:49,696 --> 01:05:50,572
Hey.

1071
01:05:52,449 --> 01:05:53,950
Did I wake you?

1072
01:05:55,702 --> 01:05:56,911
Sleep outside.

1073
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:00,665
- Why?
- Go sleep on the couch.

1074
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:03,293
The couch is a bit--

1075
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:04,335
Leave now.

1076
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:07,046
Go. Now.

1077
01:06:09,841 --> 01:06:10,800
Come on.

1078
01:06:12,343 --> 01:06:13,803
Close the door behind you.

1079
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:15,138
You're so cold.

1080
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:20,977
Fine.

1081
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:22,937
Good night.

1082
01:06:33,615 --> 01:06:37,076
Why did you call
this emergency partner meeting?

1083
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:39,329
And why did you explicitly ask

1084
01:06:39,412 --> 01:06:42,123
for a specific partner
to be excluded from this meeting?

1085
01:06:42,207 --> 01:06:43,416
Right.

1086
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:45,752
That specific partner
I asked to be excluded

1087
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:47,504
is the item on the agenda for the meeting.

1088
01:06:47,587 --> 01:06:49,672
Mr. Yoon Seok-hoon is the item?

1089
01:06:50,298 --> 01:06:51,466
Yes, that is correct.

1090
01:06:53,051 --> 01:06:54,260
Someone sent

1091
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:59,474
this photo to my office anonymously.

1092
01:07:02,644 --> 01:07:03,895
Do you recognize them?

1093
01:07:05,063 --> 01:07:07,065
It's a photo of Ms. Seo Hye-jin

1094
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:11,152
entering Mr. Yoon Seok-hoon's house
at a very late hour in the night.

1095
01:07:11,236 --> 01:07:12,487
Gosh.

1096
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:14,614
We don't know what their relationship is

1097
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:17,450
just based on a photo
of her entering his house.

1098
01:07:17,534 --> 01:07:20,370
And even if they're dating,
what's the problem?

1099
01:07:20,453 --> 01:07:23,122
He's breaking the very policy he created.

1100
01:07:23,206 --> 01:07:25,667
How hypocritical is that?

1101
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:32,382
It feels a bit uncouth to discuss
Mr. Yoon's personal life like this,

1102
01:07:32,465 --> 01:07:35,093
but I believe he's divorced.
It wouldn't be an affair.

1103
01:07:35,176 --> 01:07:37,095
Must we go this far?

1104
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:39,180
Mr. Yoon Seok-hoon

1105
01:07:39,264 --> 01:07:42,976
has compromised the ethical principles
and integrity of our organization.

1106
01:07:43,518 --> 01:07:44,852
What do you mean?

1107
01:07:44,936 --> 01:07:47,897
He entered an inappropriate relationship
with a junior lawyer

1108
01:07:47,981 --> 01:07:50,525
to manipulate her
into unscrupulously acquiring…

1109
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:54,529
confidential documents
from the opposing party,

1110
01:07:54,612 --> 01:07:55,738
which he intended to exploit.

1111
01:07:55,822 --> 01:07:58,074
He has undermined
the ethical principles and integrity

1112
01:07:58,157 --> 01:08:00,285
of the ethical wall we have established

1113
01:08:00,368 --> 01:08:04,664
through years of building trust
and attempted to dismantle it.

1114
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:11,671
What do you all think you're doing?

1115
01:09:07,894 --> 01:09:10,980
BEYOND THE BAR

1116
01:09:11,189 --> 01:09:13,107
Big news! This is insane.

1117
01:09:13,191 --> 01:09:14,275
- He resigned.
- What?

1118
01:09:14,359 --> 01:09:16,486
- I won't explain myself.
<i>- What a mess.</i>

1119
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:18,112
<i>I even thought about ending my life.</i>

1120
01:09:18,196 --> 01:09:19,989
<i>But I came to you as a last resort.</i>

1121
01:09:20,073 --> 01:09:21,282
Seriously?

1122
01:09:21,366 --> 01:09:24,410
Tell me what's going on right now.

1123
01:09:24,494 --> 01:09:25,370
Seol-yeon!

1124
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:28,539
<i>All the evidence was secured,</i>
<i>and she was arrested on the spot.</i>

1125
01:09:28,623 --> 01:09:29,499
<i>Something feels off.</i>

1126
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:31,376
<i>I guess your next target is Kang Hyo-min.</i>

1127
01:09:31,459 --> 01:09:33,294
Start groveling
if you don't want to be buried.

1128
01:09:33,378 --> 01:09:36,881
<i>To me, justice means protecting</i>
<i>the people I have to protect.</i>

1129
01:09:36,964 --> 01:09:38,758
Even if it's something illegal?

1130
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:44,013
