1
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:35,953
BEYOND THE BAR

2
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:48,048
Hello.

3
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:49,132
I'm here for Hash.

4
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:51,510
Yoon Seok-hoon.

5
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:53,720
We need to talk.

6
00:00:58,517 --> 00:00:59,935
What did you say to Yeon-a?

7
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:02,104
She seemed down for a few days

8
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:03,855
after seeing you last time.

9
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:05,774
She said she's feeling empty inside.

10
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:07,943
Must I answer?

11
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:10,946
Just a few words from you
is all it takes for her.

12
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:15,325
-It was more than a few.
-That's not the point.

13
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:19,454
You hung around just to tell me that?

14
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:20,789
As if.

15
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:23,500
Speak your piece. You have five minutes.

16
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:27,754
Once Miracle is born--

17
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:29,006
"Miracle"?

18
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:31,466
Our baby's pet name.

19
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:35,345
Once Miracle is born,
we're going to move to Singapore.

20
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:38,599
I got an expat assignment in Singapore.

21
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:40,851
Once that's done,

22
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,604
I plan to switch to a local company
and continue living there.

23
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,939
It seems like a better place
to raise kids.

24
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,567
-What about Hash?
-He's coming with us.

25
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,360
And who says you can take him?

26
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:52,070
Are you declaring war?

27
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:53,614
No, it's not that--

28
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:54,573
Not a chance.

29
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:55,532
Hey.

30
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:58,660
We have him on weekdays
and you on weekends,

31
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:00,454
which makes us his primary caretakers.

32
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:02,497
Who made you his caretaker?

33
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:05,292
You are just the husband
of Hash's co-caretaker.

34
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,419
Who are you to split us up?

35
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,254
I'm not trying to split you up--

36
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:10,213
Shut up.

37
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,134
I will pursue legal action,
so don't do anything rash.

38
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:22,434
I shouldn't have said anything.

39
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:27,314
Let's go.

40
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:30,108
Why are you telling me to get a cat?

41
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:31,985
It'd be just another hassle.

42
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:34,571
You'll get lonely once I'm in Daegu.

43
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,949
Lonely?

44
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:39,576
Apart from the last few years,

45
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,536
you've mainly worked away
in regional courts.

46
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,372
Why the sudden fuss?

47
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:48,543
Let's just take a look.

48
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:51,713
They say cats are easier
to take care of than dogs.

49
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:05,477
All our kittens stay with their mother
for about three months.

50
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,646
They're gentle and healthy.

51
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,691
The most popular breeds

52
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:13,735
are British Shorthairs,
Ragdolls, and Munchkins.

53
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:15,779
She is the daughter of a champion.

54
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,239
Oh, a champion?

55
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:21,201
Yes, her dad is Tristan,
a golden British Shorthair

56
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:23,328
who won at a TICA cat show.

57
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:26,123
Both her pedigree and breed are excellent.

58
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,625
She's like a puppy.
She's very affectionate.

59
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,211
Would you like to hold her?

60
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,672
Sure. Why don't you give it a go?

61
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,141
Why does the fire inspection test
have to be so loud?

62
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,309
Sorry. I keep asking them
to lower the volume

63
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,103
because it scares the kittens.

64
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,069
KANG HYO-MIN

65
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:58,947
28 YEARS AGO

66
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:19,176
It's okay. I'll be right there.

67
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:23,930
I'm sorry about that, sweetheart.
Did I scare you?

68
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:27,225
I'm so sorry. Please don't cry.

69
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:35,066
KANG HYO-JU

70
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,278
Hold on, sweetheart.

71
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:43,200
Sweetheart?

72
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:57,756
Sweetheart.

73
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:03,762
It's okay. Mommy will protect you.

74
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:11,019
What's wrong with that one?

75
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:15,148
Oh, she's not available.

76
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:17,442
She's a special-needs cat
who used to be a stray.

77
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:19,611
She's deaf and can't even meow.

78
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:23,949
My goodness, they all hid.

79
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,742
They'll come out in just a second.

80
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,036
Hey, can you grab some treats for them?

81
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,333
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

82
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,168
Honey.

83
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:42,259
THE TWO-LEGGED BEAST

84
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:52,143
Hello.

85
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,272
Are you Mr. Yoon Seok-hoon?

86
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,940
Yes, that's me.

87
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,900
So cool.

88
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:00,902
I've never met a real lawyer.

89
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:03,071
Let's take a selfie.

90
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:06,449
To mark this occasion.

91
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:08,285
One, two.

92
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:16,877
This is Ms. Kang Hyo-min,
one of the lawyers on my team.

93
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:23,842
-Hello, I'm Kang Hyo-min.
-I see. Hello.

94
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:28,805
You mentioned a privacy violation lawsuit
against TK Telecom.

95
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:32,142
Can you tell us
what personal data was breached?

96
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,686
When I bought my new phone,

97
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:38,565
I had the TK store
transfer over my old phone's data.

98
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:42,027
But I forgot to log out
of my cloud account,

99
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:47,365
and an employee saw a video,
which he then reported to the police.

100
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,409
What sort of video?

101
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,953
I thought it'd be better to just show you.

102
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,123
Just a moment.

103
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,920
CHOCO, GUHYEON-DONG
SEOLGI, HONGYEON-DONG

104
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:03,757
DUBU, HUIWON-DONG

105
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,716
LOADING

106
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,070
Remember to keep that energy up. Okay?

107
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,239
We're going to have some fun today.

108
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,910
I think we get the picture.
You can turn it off now.

109
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,454
His name is Dubu.

110
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:35,747
He is just so affectionate.

111
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,041
We got the idea.

112
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,335
Is that enough?

113
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:50,679
You may leave.

114
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:53,848
Pardon?

115
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:55,475
I'll handle this case by myself.

116
00:07:58,436 --> 00:07:59,521
Okay.

117
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:12,867
Based on the footage,

118
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:15,495
the employee's report
appears to be justified.

119
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,289
Animal cruelty is a criminal offense,

120
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:20,625
and the employee's report

121
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:23,545
can be deemed as a lawful act
carried out for the public good.

122
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:25,922
How is that lawful?

123
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:30,051
This is my private life,
and the video is my personal data.

124
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:32,262
And he leaked it to the police.

125
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,513
Is that not illegal?

126
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,724
Personal privacy is protected by law.

127
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,143
However,

128
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:42,105
exceptions are made
if it involves criminal conduct.

129
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:44,607
Is that so?

130
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:48,862
Then, can you be my defense attorney?

131
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,822
The case was turned over
to the prosecution.

132
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,366
Unfortunately, we won't be able
to take on this case.

133
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,367
Why not?

134
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,912
You're a top lawyer.

135
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,547
I have another meeting.

136
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,268
That's just absurd.

137
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:23,271
So a TK store employee
reported him to the police,

138
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:25,106
and he's calling that
a personal data breach?

139
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,775
That punk.

140
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,861
He pulled a fast one to land the meeting.

141
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,697
Contact the person who reported it
and offer to represent them.

142
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:35,784
Then file the notice of representation
with the prosecutors.

143
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:38,620
Although we haven't
officially been retained,

144
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:41,581
it does constitute a conflict of interest
since we obtained the information

145
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,083
through a client meeting.

146
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,918
A lawyer's ethics are very important.

147
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,921
However, the law falls short
when it comes to animal rights.

148
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:51,132
So I do not have the luxury
of fussing over ethical technicalities.

149
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:53,760
Then we'll file
the notice of representation

150
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,804
and submit an opinion brief
to the prosecution

151
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:57,597
that calls for a stern sentence.

152
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,518
Partner with an animal protection group
to file a public-interest complaint

153
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,311
and prepare for a civil lawsuit as well.

154
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,855
We must exert financial pressure
through a damages claim.

155
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,565
Should we let the media know as well?

156
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:09,192
I think turning this into a public issue

157
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,319
will ensure a harsh sentence.

158
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:14,864
There has been public outcry
over several similar cases in the past,

159
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,991
but the law hasn't caught up.

160
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:19,244
Preventing reoffending
is more important than punishment.

161
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:20,703
But still,

162
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:23,248
it's unlikely he'd be tried
while in custody.

163
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:27,043
And if he appeals,
it'll take about two years.

164
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:30,338
And in the meantime,
how many more dogs will have to suffer?

165
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:33,508
This could even end
without a prison sentence.

166
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:37,178
Imprisonment for animal cruelty cases
is extremely rare.

167
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:40,056
Let's begin by taking all actions
permitted under existing law.

168
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,183
File for an animal ownership ban

169
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:45,937
and a restraining order to prevent
any access to animal shelters.

170
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,689
Yes, sir.

171
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:51,442
A history of animal abuse could be
a sign of psychopathic tendencies.

172
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:53,236
There's a chance
he may have harmed people,

173
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,947
so see if there are any unsolved cases
surrounding Jung Wu-sol.

174
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,783
The victims would
most likely be unhoused people

175
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:00,618
or vulnerable elderly people.

176
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:02,745
Yes. Understood.

177
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:05,123
Then I'll leave you to it.

178
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:07,542
Mr. Lee, may I have a word?

179
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,419
Me? Okay.

180
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:14,507
That's nonsense.

181
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,426
I mean, Hash isn't just some dog.

182
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,928
He was abandoned at birth,
but you lovingly nurtured him

183
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,597
into becoming the decent man…

184
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,682
I mean, the decent dog he is today.

185
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,392
Calm down and take a seat.

186
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:27,187
Wait, so what are you going to do?

187
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,941
I'll file a preliminary injunction.

188
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,944
I don't feel comfortable doing it myself,
so I'm going to hire someone.

189
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,238
Do you know any lawyers
experienced in this area?

190
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,033
I'll have to look into it.

191
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:42,744
Wait. I'm a lawyer too.

192
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,705
No need to look far. I'll do it for you.

193
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,709
What's with that look?

194
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,711
Don't tell me

195
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,339
you're questioning
my abilities as an attorney.

196
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:55,840
No. Not at all.

197
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:57,508
I'm not.

198
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:01,095
But have you ever handled
a lawsuit involving pets?

199
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:03,389
Sadly, as you mentioned earlier,

200
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,808
animals are still classified
as property under the law,

201
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:08,144
so it'll be the same
as a personal property injunction.

202
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:09,354
I do that all the time.

203
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:12,190
And who knows your situation
better than me?

204
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:16,527
I'll…

205
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,323
give it my best shot.

206
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:26,496
Okay. I look forward to working with you.

207
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,580
You know I'm not cheap.

208
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:29,249
Yeah.

209
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:32,502
I'll take care of the paperwork.

210
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:33,503
Okay.

211
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,258
Jeez, you scared me.

212
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:39,300
Mr. Lee.

213
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,052
What are you doing here?

214
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,638
I wanted to ask about this.

215
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,014
But what was that about?

216
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:47,141
You don't need to know.

217
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:48,851
-Tell me.
-It's nothing.

218
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:49,811
What is it?

219
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,939
Really?

220
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,023
That's just wrong.

221
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,108
Right?

222
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,527
Hash isn't just some dog to Mr. Yoon.

223
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,195
-It's his son.
-Exactly.

224
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,532
I'll help out too.

225
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:04,826
Why?

226
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,620
I'm just doing this off the clock.

227
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,914
This won't affect
your performance review at all.

228
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:11,708
I'm sure it won't.

229
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:12,709
Then why?

230
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,712
Why would I pass up a chance
to learn more from you?

231
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,423
Come on now.
What could I possibly teach you?

232
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:24,178
I'm sure I can find something,

233
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,765
but ask Mr. Yoon first.

234
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:29,392
I'll let you in once he agrees.

235
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,853
He might not want to reveal
his private life to an associate.

236
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:32,979
Then what about you?

237
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,689
I'm his immediate subordinate.

238
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:36,566
You are two steps below him.

239
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:37,650
Okay. Pay attention.

240
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,777
You are here. I'm here.

241
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,863
Ms. Heo is here.

242
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,614
Mr. Yoon is here.

243
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:49,037
Good.

244
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:50,955
Our food's here.

245
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:53,082
-That's a huge portion.
-Wow.

246
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,334
-Thank you.
-That looks good.

247
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:56,544
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

248
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:58,338
Enjoy.

249
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:00,131
-This looks so good.
-It does.

250
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:01,924
All right.

251
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:08,848
What are you doing?

252
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,099
I know how to cut meat.

253
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,101
-That's enough. Stop it!
-Just take it.

254
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,480
Hey, Newbie.

255
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,316
Go and eat over there. Don't butt in.

256
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:21,986
Don't yell at her
when she's just enjoying her meal.

257
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,029
Eat up.

258
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,615
Unbelievable.

259
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,165
-Isn't it good?
-Isn't it good?

260
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,167
It's so good.
This place knows what they're doing.

261
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,460
Seriously.

262
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:38,628
It's good.

263
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:45,093
Gosh, who's calling during lunch?
It's just bad manners.

264
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,432
Hello, sir. No, it's fine.

265
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:54,060
What kind of lawyer takes a lunch break?

266
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:55,645
Sure.

267
00:14:57,939 --> 00:14:59,649
Yes, of course.

268
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:01,734
DAD

269
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:09,992
You know I'm being transferred
to Daegu District Court, right?

270
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,495
I'll come back on weekends,

271
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,123
but check in on Mom when you can.

272
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:16,457
Love you always.

273
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,003
You're sighing as if the world's ending.

274
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:23,005
Ms. Heo.

275
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:27,635
That woman you met the other day
at that café is your daughter, right?

276
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:28,594
Yeah.

277
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:33,724
I guess even moms
have a hard time getting over

278
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:35,685
their daughters hurting them, right?

279
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:39,147
Right. Mothers are people too.

280
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,400
But a mother-daughter relationship

281
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:43,776
is rather complicated.

282
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,112
There's hate and love at the same time.

283
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,573
You can't stand each other,
yet you miss each other.

284
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:52,410
Do you think other moms
and daughters are like that too?

285
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:55,163
I think it's safe to assume
most are like that.

286
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:57,623
Perfect moms and daughters
are hard to come by.

287
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,669
-Why do you think that is?
-I'm not sure.

288
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,754
Maybe it's due to inexperience.

289
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,924
Both moms and daughters learn as they go.

290
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:13,097
Why do you ask?
Did you do something to upset your mom?

291
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,976
I think I hurt her a bit.

292
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:22,023
Whatever it was, she probably is hurt.
You are her daughter, after all.

293
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,984
But you know, that wound
is surprisingly easy to heal.

294
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:26,903
Because you're her daughter.

295
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:29,947
-Really?
-Yeah.

296
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:33,659
My daughter once hurt me quite a bit too.

297
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,829
But when she called me "Mom"
the other day…

298
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:37,914
Mom.

299
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:48,132
It was game over for me.
Everything melted away.

300
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:51,636
-Really?
-You'll know when you become a mom.

301
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:54,680
I hear that all the time.

302
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:59,060
All love is amazing and noble,

303
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:01,896
but there's something
a little more special about a mom's love.

304
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:05,316
You can't fully understand it
just from secondhand experience.

305
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,985
That's why the worst thing
a mom can say to her daughter is,

306
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,695
"I hope your daughter is just like you."

307
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:12,657
I would not like that at all.

308
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,035
I know it's a cliché,
but treat her well while you still can.

309
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:18,412
Always be grateful
that your mom is still around.

310
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,122
Treat her with care.

311
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,210
Do you have
a good relationship with your mom?

312
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,545
She passed away.

313
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,758
Seeing your mom lying in the mortuary

314
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,887
is a really jarring sight.

315
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,140
You wonder,
"Was my mom always this small?"

316
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,563
You can't say goodbye
without feeling remorse.

317
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:44,522
But still,

318
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:47,608
you should avoid
scarring your heart if you can.

319
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:52,071
So I'm telling you
to treat her well for your sake.

320
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,781
Take one brick at a time,

321
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,950
and build a protective wall of love

322
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:58,160
so it hurts less later on.

323
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:00,288
I will, Ms. Heo.

324
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:01,455
Eat up.

325
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,338
Wait. My tumbler.

326
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:11,257
Go ahead. I'll go get my tumbler.

327
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,383
-Okay.
-See you.

328
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,677
Go on. Hurry now.

329
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:16,846
You're ridiculous.

330
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,557
How oblivious can she be?

331
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:22,602
What are you trying to do here?

332
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:25,021
You might as well grab a megaphone
and tell the world.

333
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,230
Can I?

334
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:27,398
-I am--
-Stop it!

335
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:28,816
Jeez.

336
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:30,443
You're unbelievable.

337
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,112
-Ta-da.
-What is that?

338
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,489
I thought my woman might be tired.

339
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,075
I'm being a supportive partner.

340
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,078
I don't eat candy anymore. I quit sugar.

341
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:42,705
This is sugar-free.

342
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,458
But my heart is full of sweetness for you.

343
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:49,128
Give me one.

344
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,504
Say, "Ah."

345
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:54,216
It's so good.

346
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,426
-Isn't it?
-Yeah.

347
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:56,969
I eat these all the time.

348
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,804
Give me another one.

349
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:00,014
-Two?
-Yeah.

350
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,141
I should have at least two at a time.

351
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,806
Do you have a dog too?

352
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:08,708
What's your deal, you bastard?

353
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,001
I haven't done anything.

354
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,045
Ms. Kang, you step out first.

355
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:15,214
Okay.

356
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:18,509
That hurts.

357
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,729
Add his face to the recognition system
and blacklist him.

358
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,731
Make sure
he's never allowed in here again.

359
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:33,566
Yes, sir. Let's go.

360
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:44,160
What a psycho perv.

361
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,455
Thank goodness for Mr. Yoon.

362
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,583
What are you talking about?
I know taekwondo.

363
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:53,502
Stop messing around.

364
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:56,297
The smartest move in that situation
is removing yourself.

365
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,256
Yeah.

366
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:00,593
Anyhow, has your mom texted you back?

367
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:01,552
No.

368
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,264
You better not tell my mom about this.

369
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:06,849
I won't.

370
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,143
You flipped the last time
I talked to her about you.

371
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:12,188
-I haven't called her in days.
-She hasn't reached out to you?

372
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,064
No, I haven't heard from her.

373
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:18,235
Poor Ms. Choi. She must be so upset.

374
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:21,238
She's ignoring my texts
and not even calling Ji-eun.

375
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:23,574
If she's not texting you back,
just call her.

376
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:26,118
I did. She didn't pick up.

377
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:28,996
That must be Ms. Choi.

378
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,125
Hello?

379
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:36,295
Ms. Kang. Where are you right now?

380
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,546
I'm home.

381
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,423
Did something happen?

382
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:40,966
Well…

383
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:44,345
I got hit by a car,
and I'm in the hospital right now.

384
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:45,387
What?

385
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,598
Are you hurt badly?

386
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,433
No, I'm okay.

387
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:54,396
To tell you the truth,
I was working a part-time delivery job.

388
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:55,898
Why?

389
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:57,900
For your mom's debt?

390
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:01,403
No, I made sure to set
clear boundaries with her about that.

391
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:05,032
I was going to get a gym membership,
but I figured this was a quicker way

392
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:07,910
to get some exercise
and save up for our new place.

393
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,371
I only do it sometimes
when I don't have to work late.

394
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:12,331
I see.

395
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,543
I'm going to be discharged on Sunday.

396
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:17,211
Then what about the twins?

397
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:20,506
They're at my aunt's.
It's her day to watch them.

398
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:23,634
But tomorrow is the issue.

399
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:26,846
I promised them we'd go out
since it's the weekend.

400
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,640
Do you want me to babysit?

401
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:32,685
Really? It's the weekend.
Don't you have plans?

402
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,061
No, I don't.

403
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:35,855
You mean it?

404
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:38,607
We just became friends,
and I'm already an inconvenience.

405
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:41,235
Come on, don't say that.

406
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:43,904
Don't worry. I'll take good care of them.

407
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:46,240
Thank you so much.

408
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,993
Don't worry, and get better soon.

409
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:53,205
-Who was that?
-Ho-yeon.

410
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:55,124
-Is she hurt?
-Yeah.

411
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,751
She was in a car accident,
but it's not serious.

412
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,257
I'm such a genius.

413
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:08,554
Hash, we need to pack this as well.

414
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:13,058
KANG HYO-MIN

415
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:18,814
Hello?

416
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:21,817
Hello, Mr. Yoon! Did something happen?

417
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,614
No, nothing has happened.

418
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,034
Sorry.

419
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:36,916
I called you by accident.

420
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,168
It's fine.

421
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:41,045
I…

422
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:42,588
Yes?

423
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:45,758
I was wondering if you had plans tomorrow.

424
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,218
I've got a few things going on.

425
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:49,303
I see.

426
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,305
Right. Of course.

427
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,183
Is everything okay?

428
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,402
KANG HYO-JU

429
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:10,824
It's okay.

430
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:13,285
Mommy will protect you.

431
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:40,396
Ma'am, what brings you by at this hour?

432
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:44,942
We have other healthy kittens
with good pedigrees.

433
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:48,404
And she might be a bit challenging
for someone without experience--

434
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,823
No, I'll take her.

435
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,201
I'll learn as I go.

436
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:56,453
All right.

437
00:24:57,162 --> 00:25:00,457
Then I'll give you
what you need for the night.

438
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:02,668
Litter boxes are crucial for cats.

439
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:04,920
-I'll be back to explain further.
-Okay.

440
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:09,008
All right.

441
00:25:18,392 --> 00:25:19,727
Let's have some fun today.

442
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,067
Hello.

443
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:28,902
-Hello.
-Hello.

444
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:30,446
Hey there. How have you been?

445
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:31,864
-Good.
-Let's go.

446
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:32,948
Come on, let's go.

447
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,951
-You can do it
-You can do it

448
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:40,539
-Just tell us that
-Just tell us that

449
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:44,418
-Then we can do anything
-Then we can do anything

450
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:47,671
-Whatever it may be
-Whatever it may be

451
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,007
Be careful.

452
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,884
Seo-yeon, Mi-yeon, wait for us.

453
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,055
This place is so nice.

454
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:57,431
Have you been here before?

455
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:59,725
Yes, I come here often with Hash.

456
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,851
I see.

457
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:03,228
The twins seem to like it too.

458
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:07,191
This lodge is pet and kid-friendly.
I'm sure they'll like it.

459
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:11,153
I'm sorry for crashing in
on your quality time with Hash.

460
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,112
I didn't mean to.

461
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:14,198
No, it's fine. This is actually better.

462
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,493
It's nice. Hash seems to be enjoying
the company.

463
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:22,289
I managed to reserve another room.
You can stay there with the twins.

464
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:23,582
Thank you, Mr. Yoon.

465
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:26,293
Hash, no!

466
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:27,336
Hey!

467
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,243
All right, Hash.

468
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:36,780
What are you up to?

469
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:39,950
Just relaxing. Where are the twins?

470
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,244
They totally passed out.

471
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,205
They must be tired.

472
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:48,584
Hash looks tired too.

473
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:50,460
Of course.

474
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:52,588
Babysitting is exhausting.

475
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,965
We had it easy, thanks to him.

476
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:56,675
Yes, we did.

477
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,347
Hash is just an angel.

478
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:05,893
He's so smart. He matches
the kids' energy and plays with them.

479
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:07,436
I heard

480
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,689
that Hash might be moving overseas.

481
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:12,774
I overheard your conversation last time.

482
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:15,110
You did?

483
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:17,905
I want to help too.

484
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,698
It's a personal matter.

485
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:21,950
And it's nothing complicated.

486
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:26,330
It may not be complicated,
but it's important.

487
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:29,750
What good is being a lawyer

488
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:32,669
if we can't help each other
with legal matters?

489
00:28:32,753 --> 00:28:35,923
The real reward comes
from helping and supporting one another.

490
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:39,092
Seeing you with Hash today

491
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:40,928
made me want to help even more.

492
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:45,891
You know how capable I am.
I'm sure I could be helpful.

493
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:48,227
I am your greatest masterpiece, after all.

494
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:51,480
All right. I accept.

495
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:54,149
Thank you for choosing to retain me.

496
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:55,400
I will give it my all.

497
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:00,489
But…

498
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:04,368
I'm also worried about stopping them.

499
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:07,412
My ex-wife is a painter
who mostly works from home.

500
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:09,831
If something comes up,
her husband can step in.

501
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:13,460
On the other hand, I'm alone.

502
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,422
That's why you need Hash more.

503
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:21,468
That is how I feel.

504
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:24,638
But stopping them
could end up making Hash more lonely.

505
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:25,847
That's true love.

506
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:28,767
What was Hash like as a puppy?

507
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:31,186
He must've been cute.
Do you have pictures?

508
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:35,607
He must have been about this big?

509
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:37,943
He was really small.

510
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:40,404
So cute and adorable.

511
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,239
Hold on.

512
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:52,666
-Hello.
-Yes, hello.

513
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,167
-Registered mail.
-I see.

514
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,379
-Please sign here.
-Sure.

515
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:01,049
Here you go. Thank you.

516
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:11,476
INJUNCTION PROHIBITING
TRANSFER OF POSSESSION

517
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,354
An injunction to stop
the transfer of possession.

518
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:18,317
As if we didn't already know
you were a lawyer.

519
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:21,153
Look at you go all out, Yoon Seok-hoon.

520
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:22,112
Who is it?

521
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:27,826
Just some registered mail from work.

522
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:35,667
Thank goodness I decided
to work from home today.

523
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:38,462
So this is how you want to play it? Fine.

524
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:45,218
-How about Chinese?
-What do you want to eat?

525
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:47,804
-I was going to have a sandwich.
-A sandwich?

526
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:49,598
-How about spicy sausage stew?
-Stew?

527
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,183
With some ramyeon noodles.

528
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:55,103
RECORDINGS, EMAIL, HYNIC CORE
MEETING MINUTES

529
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,355
COPYING

530
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:03,987
Why are you so jumpy?

531
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:06,448
You scared me.

532
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:07,908
Aren't you eating lunch?

533
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,577
You can go ahead.
I just need to finish this.

534
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:14,039
Do it after you eat.
Don't skip meals to put food on the table.

535
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:18,335
I just can't help
but feel sorry for you, Yun-geun.

536
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:21,213
It's like you're being tortured
with false hope.

537
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:23,090
Do you think that if you work hard enough,

538
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:24,883
they'll let you be a lawyer here?

539
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:56,206
Ms. Kwon.

540
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,006
Get dressed.

541
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:06,675
Pardon?

542
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:10,637
Who was it?

543
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:13,098
Who put you up to this?

544
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:16,184
What do you mean?

545
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:19,604
Open the door.

546
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:35,495
I knew you were married, Ms. Kwon.

547
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:40,125
And I know adultery
is morally reprehensible,

548
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,752
-but I just fell for your charms--
-Just stop.

549
00:32:43,837 --> 00:32:45,505
I have no desire

550
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:48,467
to ruin your bright future over this mess.

551
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,302
If you cooperate,

552
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:53,555
I'll spare you.

553
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,519
Could you give us a moment alone?

554
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:09,696
You know me, right?

555
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:10,739
Yes.

556
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:15,577
I worked with you
on the Wiz Securities mis-selling case.

557
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,915
I remember you being
quite capable back then.

558
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,124
Yes.

559
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:23,627
Thanks to your praise,

560
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:26,588
I started getting
meaningful work assignments.

561
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:30,008
You were the only one
who ever gave me…

562
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:34,596
fair recognition.

563
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:38,183
Were you blackmailed?
Or were you promised a position?

564
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:42,896
In this situation,

565
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:45,899
I am the only one who can help you.

566
00:33:49,236 --> 00:33:50,403
It was both.

567
00:33:51,238 --> 00:33:53,156
To pay for law school,

568
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,409
I once worked
at an adult entertainment establishment.

569
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:00,664
I was blackmailed with that.

570
00:34:01,331 --> 00:34:02,916
-By Ha Du-sik?
-Yes.

571
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:06,127
He promised that I'd be promoted
from a paralegal to an attorney.

572
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:10,465
I checked your work log

573
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:13,385
and saw that you were involved
both at the time of Bluestone's investment

574
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:16,346
and Hynic Core's sale to Optalyn.

575
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:18,640
What was your assignment in those cases?

576
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:21,393
Just the menial tasks I always do.

577
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:24,729
I organized the meeting notes,
made copies,

578
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:27,566
and shredded confidential documents,
among other things.

579
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:29,943
We cannot promise

580
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:32,529
a promotion to attorney.

581
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:36,533
However, we can promise to create
a system where you will be

582
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:40,912
properly evaluated based solely
on the abilities you demonstrate at Yullim

583
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:44,749
and not your law school background
or bar exam scores that have hindered you

584
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,418
up until now.

585
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,503
Mr. Ha Du-sik is backed

586
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:52,048
by Mr. Ko Seung-cheol.

587
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:54,593
-We're aware.
-He won't just stand by and watch.

588
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:56,886
They'll make sure I never set foot
in the legal field.

589
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:59,889
And you think Ms. Kwon
isn't capable of the same?

590
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:02,684
Either way, you must choose.

591
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:05,854
And no matter which way you choose,
you must prepare yourself

592
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,815
to be shunned in the legal profession
if things go wrong.

593
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:12,193
However, we are
a step above them in one area.

594
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:13,153
What's that?

595
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:14,904
We keep our promises.

596
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:18,033
If you help us, you will be safe.

597
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:22,871
And I promise
that you'll be evaluated fairly.

598
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,549
What…

599
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:37,886
do I have to do?

600
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,347
I heard you keep recordings of everything.

601
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:44,017
Do you still have the files
concerning Bluestone and Optalyn?

602
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:45,769
Yes.

603
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:48,438
I have all of them.

604
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,940
I also still have
the confidential documents.

605
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:51,941
Why?

606
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:54,527
I swear I only kept those to study--

607
00:35:54,611 --> 00:35:56,279
Do you know what we're looking for?

608
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:58,531
Yes.

609
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,586
Come in.

610
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:14,047
Mr. Ban Gi-seung is here.

611
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,048
Sir!

612
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:17,550
You may leave.

613
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,847
What's going on?
I told you to stay away from the office.

614
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:24,766
I apologize, but it's an emergency.

615
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:26,810
Please take a look.

616
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:30,814
What is this?

617
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,274
Optalyn has filed

618
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:35,735
a lawsuit against Bluestone Fund.

619
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:38,029
A lawsuit? Why?

620
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:41,157
For breaching the seller's
representations and warranties.

621
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:42,492
What are you talking about?

622
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:46,204
Optalyn purchased Hynic Core
for their NPU-based technology.

623
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:47,706
To maintain and develop it,

624
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:50,166
they need the core data
and operational logic.

625
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,544
But the software code is encrypted,

626
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,714
and the core logic remains undocumented.

627
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:58,591
It's practically impossible to implement.

628
00:36:58,675 --> 00:36:59,884
What?

629
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:01,010
In other words,

630
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,432
Optalyn basically bought
only the shell of the company.

631
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:08,268
Hold on.
Were we not aware of this until now?

632
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:10,729
Semiconductor technology
is not really our forte.

633
00:37:13,857 --> 00:37:17,110
We handed over all the materials
related to Hynic Core's technology.

634
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,780
What exactly is the breach of contract?

635
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:22,782
Clauses five and thirteen.

636
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:28,913
SELLER'S REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

637
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:30,999
Optalyn is seeking a contract termination,

638
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:34,461
the return of the purchase price,
and even compensation for damages.

639
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:35,962
How much?

640
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,884
The estimate is over 200 billion won.

641
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:45,680
Sir.

642
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,142
How should we respond?

643
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:53,563
Why are you asking me?

644
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:58,610
Bluestone is a fund managed
by an asset management company.

645
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:01,446
The asset management company
should figure this out.

646
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:02,447
Wait.

647
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:05,575
Sir, how could you say that now?

648
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:07,911
You should leave.
There are a lot of prying eyes around.

649
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:09,412
I'll be in touch.

650
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,164
Sir.

651
00:38:20,757 --> 00:38:21,716
Yes, sir.

652
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,053
Understood.

653
00:38:57,418 --> 00:39:00,547
DAD

654
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:04,717
Hey, Dad.

655
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:06,678
I can't reach Mom.

656
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,596
Is she with you, by any chance?

657
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:12,100
No, I was actually just about to call you
to check if she's home

658
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:14,519
because I can't reach her either.

659
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:16,020
Really?

660
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:20,525
I thought she was ignoring my calls
because she was upset with me.

661
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:21,985
I'll see if she's home.

662
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,081
She's definitely home.

663
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:37,375
Mom.

664
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:43,089
Is she sleeping?

665
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:46,342
Mom.

666
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:49,929
Mom?

667
00:39:51,431 --> 00:39:52,348
Mom.

668
00:39:53,266 --> 00:39:54,976
What's wrong? What happened?

669
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:58,813
Hyo-min.

670
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,482
Hyo-min.

671
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,738
Hyo-min.

672
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,618
I was so freaked out.

673
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:14,370
I've never seen her cry like that.

674
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:17,415
Wait. What's wrong with the kitty?

675
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:19,584
It's a side effect of the vaccines.

676
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,628
Then you should take her to the vet.

677
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:23,171
You think she didn't already?

678
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:26,674
I guess the ER gave the kitten
some antibiotics, and they're helping.

679
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:31,095
But she just refuses to leave her side,
and she's crying with the saddest eyes.

680
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:33,973
Okay, I'll be right there.

681
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:36,100
Okay. Hurry.

682
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,906
Mom, Ji-eun is on her way here.

683
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:54,118
Why? It's late.

684
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:57,205
Her family has six cats.

685
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,040
She's a total pro with cats.

686
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:01,584
Really?

687
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:03,044
Did you eat?

688
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:06,255
I'm fine. I don't feel like eating.

689
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,050
I assume you haven't been sleeping.

690
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,510
You look terrible.

691
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,221
I'll cook something.

692
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:15,640
No.

693
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:18,184
I need to feed her in a bit.

694
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:23,064
The vaccines made her lose her appetite,
so she's not eating.

695
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,901
I've been force-feeding her
every two hours.

696
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:28,903
I need to give her medicine too.

697
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:30,279
I'll do it.

698
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,323
After I make you something to eat.

699
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:43,501
Mom, come out and eat.

700
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:47,422
Mom.

701
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:49,674
Mom.

702
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:57,473
Gosh.

703
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:02,770
You should sleep on the bed.

704
00:42:18,578 --> 00:42:21,456
-Where's your mom?
-She fell asleep while I was cooking.

705
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:25,168
She must have stayed up for days
looking after that little kitty.

706
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:26,127
And the kitty?

707
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,670
In her hideout on the bed.

708
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:30,339
She needs to eat and take her meds.

709
00:42:30,423 --> 00:42:32,550
-I'll do it after I wash my hands.
-Okay.

710
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,471
Thanks.

711
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:56,741
TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER BRIEF

712
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:57,700

MEETING NOTES

00:42:58,826 --> 00:42:59,994
EQUITY ACQUISITION METHOD

715
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:01,829
It appears we have
the basic framework now.

716
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:05,500
They probably have no idea
that we have a recording of this.

717
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:06,834
But this won't be enough.

718
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:09,087
Mr. Ko really is a prudent man.

719
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,672
I don't think Ha Du-sik's words

720
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:14,092
will be enough
to serve as conclusive evidence.

721
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:18,513
Evidence that proves Mr. Ko
is the mastermind behind all of it

722
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:21,557
must be in Bluestone's hands.

723
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:22,767
I assume so.

724
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:26,437
But why would they ever give that up?
They're on the same team.

725
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:28,606
Those rotten bastards.

726
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:29,732
Actually,

727
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:34,153
Optalyn has filed
a suit against Bluestone.

728
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:35,738
Why?

729
00:43:35,822 --> 00:43:38,533
Optalyn purchased Hynic Core

730
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:40,910
for their NPU-based technology.

731
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:45,331
But after the purchase, they realized
the software code was encrypted,

732
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:48,251
and the core operational logic
was not even documented.

733
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:50,878
So they can't actually
use the technology right now.

734
00:43:50,962 --> 00:43:52,421
What does that mean?

735
00:43:52,505 --> 00:43:56,008
Were there any technical documents
that Hynic Core kept from them?

736
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:57,510
No, there weren't.

737
00:43:57,593 --> 00:44:00,179
Bluestone would never do that.
They took every last bit.

738
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,890
But while we were
developing the technology,

739
00:44:02,974 --> 00:44:05,143
we didn't record every little thing.

740
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:09,021
Then how would
the technology be implemented?

741
00:44:09,939 --> 00:44:12,525
Well, you just do it.

742
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:14,485
It's all in here.

743
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:19,490
That's also why
I was suspected of embezzlement.

744
00:44:20,116 --> 00:44:22,451
I kept all the financial records
in here too.

745
00:44:23,286 --> 00:44:27,707
"FPGA development board
purchased at 8.8 million won

746
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,458
on March 21, 2023. VAT included."

747
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:32,128
"HBM3 memory module
purchased at 13.2 million won

748
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:34,088
on April 12. VAT included."

749
00:44:46,726 --> 00:44:49,020
-We can get your company back.
-What?

750
00:44:49,979 --> 00:44:51,480
-Really?
-Yes.

751
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:55,985
We need to meet
with the asset management company first.

752
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:58,321
This could create a rift between them.

753
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:06,996
Cherry.

754
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,499
Baby?

755
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:15,379
Ji-eun is taking care of her.

756
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:17,048
Really?

757
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:21,844
Get some more rest.
I told you, Ji-eun is a pro.

758
00:45:21,928 --> 00:45:25,139
She fed her and gave her the medicine.

759
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:26,891
You should get some proper sleep.

760
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:32,813
Come on.

761
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:41,530
I think she's feeling a bit better.
She's playing with Ji-eun right now.

762
00:45:41,614 --> 00:45:43,282
Don't worry. Get some sleep.

763
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:03,761
Why did you suddenly decide to get a cat?

764
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:06,055
Your dad

765
00:46:07,348 --> 00:46:09,308
suggested it so I wouldn't get lonely.

766
00:46:09,392 --> 00:46:10,434
Jeez.

767
00:46:11,227 --> 00:46:14,146
You refused to let me have one.

768
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:17,441
I didn't want to because
I'm still not confident I can raise one.

769
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:20,528
But at the breeder's,

770
00:46:21,362 --> 00:46:22,822
I saw Cherry.

771
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:25,032
She reminded me of Hyo-ju.

772
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:28,452
Hyo-ju?

773
00:46:32,248 --> 00:46:33,666
Cherry can't hear.

774
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:35,543
She can't even meow.

775
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:40,172
Really?

776
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:48,889
I brought her here
when she was doing just fine.

777
00:46:50,391 --> 00:46:52,226
I knew I couldn't do it.

778
00:46:52,852 --> 00:46:54,812
I don't deserve to be a mother either.

779
00:46:56,272 --> 00:46:58,065
I can't take care of anyone.

780
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:04,780
Don't say that.

781
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:12,621
Vaccines sometimes cause side effects.

782
00:47:12,705 --> 00:47:15,124
You can't just blame yourself for that.

783
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:26,469
Hyo-ju used to get hurt often
when she was little.

784
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:31,015
Maybe it was because she couldn't hear.
She just kept getting hurt.

785
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:35,061
But she didn't even cry much.

786
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:39,482
Her vocal cords were fine.
She could make sounds.

787
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:46,197
At some point, it became an obsession.

788
00:47:48,324 --> 00:47:51,369
I would get anxious
if Hyo-ju wasn't in front of me.

789
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:55,081
That's why

790
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:58,167
I would watch her

791
00:47:58,918 --> 00:48:01,170
and follow her around all day.

792
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:04,548
Now I know I was being overprotective.

793
00:48:05,466 --> 00:48:06,717
Maybe that's why

794
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:10,179
she was a little slow in her development.

795
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:12,181
Was she?

796
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:18,312
And then, that incident happened.

797
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:20,314
What incident?

798
00:48:22,191 --> 00:48:25,486
Did something happen to Hyo-ju?

799
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:28,406
No.

800
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:32,785
Not to Hyo-ju. To you.

801
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:35,538
Because I was busy hovering over Hyo-ju,

802
00:48:36,372 --> 00:48:39,166
I practically neglected you.

803
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:42,670
After all, I can't be
in two places at once.

804
00:48:47,383 --> 00:48:48,509
Do you remember?

805
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:50,136
That time

806
00:48:51,137 --> 00:48:53,055
you fell down the stairs.

807
00:48:58,227 --> 00:48:59,270
Vaguely.

808
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:03,858
I think I broke my right arm

809
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:06,068
and my left leg.

810
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:09,572
It was a complete mess.

811
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:14,618
Hyo-ju's development was delayed
because I would fuss too much,

812
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:17,204
and you got hurt

813
00:49:18,414 --> 00:49:20,708
because I neglected you.

814
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:21,917
I really am…

815
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:26,672
terrible at everything.

816
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:30,301
Don't say that.

817
00:49:32,178 --> 00:49:33,137
So,

818
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:35,681
is that why

819
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,185
you had Auntie adopt Hyo-ju?

820
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:47,067
It didn't happen right away.

821
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:57,453
I…

822
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:03,459
hurt your aunt in many ways.

823
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:06,003
How?

824
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:09,465
She introduced me to your uncle
before they got married,

825
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:13,636
and I found out he was born deaf.

826
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:17,431
I don't know why
that made me so angry back then.

827
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:20,559
I said a lot of hurtful things
to your aunt.

828
00:50:21,894 --> 00:50:24,522
She was eager to have a baby,

829
00:50:26,315 --> 00:50:27,775
but I told her not to.

830
00:50:29,068 --> 00:50:32,071
I asked her what the point would be
of having a deaf child.

831
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:33,697
That's terrible.

832
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,616
I know, right?

833
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:37,868
Maybe…

834
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:42,790
my words made it happen.

835
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:46,752
It turned out your aunt
was actually infertile.

836
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:49,630
Seeing Hyo-ju…

837
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:56,178
made me wonder
if my daughter was being punished

838
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:02,935
for all the terrible things
I said to my sister.

839
00:51:07,982 --> 00:51:10,442
I suddenly felt
I needed to apologize to her,

840
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:14,947
so I called her, and she came running.

841
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:17,825
Without ever being a mother herself,

842
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:22,079
she instantly knew
what Hyo-ju needed and wanted.

843
00:51:22,997 --> 00:51:25,332
She made Hyo-ju,
who was always expressionless,

844
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:29,086
smile.

845
00:51:30,129 --> 00:51:31,672
She even laughed out loud.

846
00:51:33,132 --> 00:51:34,842
It made me wonder

847
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:38,762
if I had ever heard Hyo-ju's voice at all.

848
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:44,018
Hyo-ju was one thing,

849
00:51:44,685 --> 00:51:48,022
but I also felt so sorry
for neglecting you all the time.

850
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:51,567
You were also just a baby
wanting to feel your mom's touch.

851
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:55,738
Back then,
I hadn't even realized you were gifted.

852
00:51:56,614 --> 00:51:58,824
I had never even read you a book.

853
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:02,620
Without ever having
a single book read to you,

854
00:52:02,703 --> 00:52:05,331
you learned to read
the Korean alphabet by yourself.

855
00:52:12,755 --> 00:52:14,381
I was an amazing daughter.

856
00:52:18,761 --> 00:52:20,387
You still are.

857
00:52:23,432 --> 00:52:24,308
Yeah.

858
00:52:27,603 --> 00:52:28,520
Aren't you hungry?

859
00:52:31,649 --> 00:52:32,691
A little.

860
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:34,985
Should we have some ramyeon?

861
00:52:37,363 --> 00:52:38,572
Don't be absurd.

862
00:52:45,037 --> 00:52:46,121
Should we?

863
00:52:47,373 --> 00:52:48,624
How about four servings?

864
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:01,220
Let's keep things amicable.

865
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:04,098
My client is hoping to avoid litigation.

866
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:05,974
Nobody actively seeks litigation.

867
00:53:06,475 --> 00:53:08,644
It is simply done as a last resort.

868
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:10,229
We should consider Hash's well-being.

869
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:11,313
"Hash's well-being"?

870
00:53:11,397 --> 00:53:13,482
We're doing this
for the sake of his well-being.

871
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:16,527
Our client is like a father to Hash.

872
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:19,405
How could Hash ever find happiness
in some faraway, foreign land

873
00:53:19,488 --> 00:53:21,490
without his father around?

874
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:22,574
-Hold on.
-His father--

875
00:53:23,492 --> 00:53:26,161
Let's set aside emotions
and address it purely on legal grounds.

876
00:53:26,245 --> 00:53:27,663
Legally, Hash is recognized

877
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:30,916
as property jointly owned
by our client and the respondent.

878
00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:33,794
Custody rights during weekdays
and weekends are also clearly stipulated.

879
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:35,879
The respondent's attempt
to take him overseas

880
00:53:35,963 --> 00:53:37,297
is a clear breach of contract

881
00:53:37,381 --> 00:53:40,676
and constitutes a serious infringement
of our client's weekend custody rights.

882
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:42,594
If no agreement is reached,

883
00:53:42,678 --> 00:53:44,346
we will petition the court

884
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:47,516
for a preliminary injunction
to impose a travel ban on Hash.

885
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:50,644
Yoon Seok-hoon, can I see you outside?

886
00:53:50,728 --> 00:53:51,812
-You can't.
-No!

887
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:55,190
Seol Yeon-a is the respondent
on this injunction application.

888
00:53:55,274 --> 00:53:57,818
She is also the other party
in the divorce settlement agreement.

889
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:59,278
But you…

890
00:54:01,697 --> 00:54:02,573
Mr. Jung Won-jun.

891
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:04,575
-Mr. Jang Won-jun.
-Jung Won-jun.

892
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:06,702
Right, Mr. Jung Won-jun.

893
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:10,205
You're a third party with no connection
whatsoever to this case.

894
00:54:10,289 --> 00:54:12,249
What right does a third party have here

895
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:14,251
to request to speak to our client?

896
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:17,045
If there is something that you must say,

897
00:54:17,129 --> 00:54:21,049
we'd appreciate it if you did so
through the counsel present.

898
00:54:32,728 --> 00:54:33,854
Mr. Yoon.

899
00:54:36,982 --> 00:54:39,234
-Are you going to pick up Hash?
-Yes.

900
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:42,112
Here. I bought some stuff for him.

901
00:54:42,196 --> 00:54:44,573
As a thank you
for your help babysitting last week.

902
00:54:44,656 --> 00:54:45,908
You didn't need to.

903
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:48,619
My mom actually adopted a kitten,

904
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:51,622
so I just picked these up
while I was at the pet shop.

905
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:54,124
I see. Your mom has a cat now.

906
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:55,125
Yes.

907
00:54:55,751 --> 00:54:59,046
-That's a lot.
-Some treats and a collar.

908
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:00,547
It looked like he didn't have one.

909
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:03,133
Hash doesn't like collars.

910
00:55:03,217 --> 00:55:06,637
This isn't just any collar.

911
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,847
It has a GPS feature,
so you can track his location.

912
00:55:08,931 --> 00:55:11,099
It has other smart functions too.

913
00:55:11,183 --> 00:55:13,477
It's small,
so it shouldn't bother him too much.

914
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,770
Is that so?

915
00:55:15,354 --> 00:55:16,730
That's nice.

916
00:55:16,814 --> 00:55:20,150
If you don't mind,
could I give it to him in person?

917
00:55:20,776 --> 00:55:21,944
I miss him.

918
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:24,071
I'll leave right afterward.

919
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:25,614
Sure. Feel free.

920
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:40,963
I can pair his collar
with the app on your phone.

921
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:42,214
Can I see your phone?

922
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:43,882
I can do it.

923
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:46,885
I was given thorough instructions,
so just let me.

924
00:55:46,969 --> 00:55:47,845
Give me your phone.

925
00:55:49,805 --> 00:55:51,181
All right, then.

926
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:00,691
Hello.

927
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:02,401
-Hello.
-Hi there.

928
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:05,779
I'm Yoon Seok-hoon's cousin.
I'm here to pick up Hash.

929
00:56:05,863 --> 00:56:08,073
You're a bit early.

930
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:09,324
Yes.

931
00:56:09,408 --> 00:56:11,994
We need to confirm it
with the guardian on file first.

932
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:15,289
I'll call him right now.

933
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,083
Wait.

934
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:20,669
He did say he had a trial today.

935
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:21,837
No, it's fine.

936
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:23,255
Just a moment.

937
00:56:29,845 --> 00:56:31,555
What do you mean someone else took him?

938
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:32,514
Well,

939
00:56:33,015 --> 00:56:35,767
he said he was your cousin.

940
00:56:46,987 --> 00:56:47,988
It can't be.

941
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:58,540
Mr. Yoon, guess where we are.

942
00:56:58,624 --> 00:56:59,541
DON'T CALL THE POLICE

943
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:07,299
"Dad, please be his attorney."

944
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:09,968
"Why are you playing so hard to get?"

945
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:14,306
If you are willing to defend this client,

946
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:15,807
you're welcome to come here.

947
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:17,476
The address is

948
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:20,103
a secret!

949
00:57:32,658 --> 00:57:36,286
A history of animal abuse could be
a sign of psychopathic tendencies.

950
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:37,245
PERSONAL DETAILS

951
00:57:37,329 --> 00:57:38,997
There's a chance
he may have harmed people,

952
00:57:39,081 --> 00:57:42,042
so see if there are any unsolved cases
surrounding Jung Wu-sol.

953
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:51,468
SERIES OF PET DISAPPEARANCE CASES
IN HUIWON-DONG, SAPYEONG-GU

954
00:57:54,096 --> 00:57:55,180
Mr. Yoon.

955
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:58,225
Mr. Yoon, pull yourself together.

956
00:57:58,976 --> 00:58:00,435
We need to go find Hash.

957
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:09,194
Sir, can you go a little faster?

958
00:58:10,112 --> 00:58:13,115
Mr. Yoon, you cannot get emotional.

959
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:14,491
Our goal right now

960
00:58:15,117 --> 00:58:17,661
is to bring Hash back safely.
Do you understand?

961
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:29,381
Mr. Yoon, here.

962
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:33,802
-This looks like the place, right?
-Yes.

963
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:37,556
Hash.

964
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:39,016
Hash.

965
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:40,517
Hash.

966
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,019
Turn around.

967
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:46,982
Hash.

968
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:51,361
Damn it.

969
00:58:51,445 --> 00:58:52,988
Hey!

970
00:59:02,914 --> 00:59:04,583
Good job finding this place.

971
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:07,335
I thought I could trust you to come alone,

972
00:59:07,419 --> 00:59:08,879
so I came to welcome you.

973
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:11,173
But I see you brought
your junior colleague.

974
00:59:15,635 --> 00:59:17,554
Yes. My name is Kang Hyo-min.

975
00:59:18,305 --> 00:59:19,765
I came here today

976
00:59:19,848 --> 00:59:22,142
because I felt bad
for making you feel uncomfortable

977
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:23,894
during our consultation last time.

978
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:26,063
Seeing you like this,

979
00:59:26,146 --> 00:59:29,441
I think I can understand
where you're coming from.

980
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:30,859
How so?

981
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:32,569
We'll represent you.

982
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:35,405
We'll make sure you don't go to jail.

983
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:37,157
Is that possible?

984
00:59:38,075 --> 00:59:40,827
Didn't you come to us
because of Mr. Yoon's reputation?

985
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:42,204
I did. He's really famous.

986
00:59:42,913 --> 00:59:45,999
But people can have differing opinions,
so I prepared a little something.

987
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:47,626
It wasn't easy.

988
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:50,879
But luckily, I have innocent eyes.

989
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:53,632
People and animals alike
warm up to me easily.

990
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:57,719
Am I the only one who thinks that?

991
00:59:57,803 --> 00:59:59,054
Don't they look innocent?

992
01:00:01,056 --> 01:00:02,808
They do.

993
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:05,769
Mr. Jung.

994
01:00:07,104 --> 01:00:08,146
Pay attention now.

995
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:10,982
I can say with certainty
that Yoon Seok-hoon

996
01:00:11,066 --> 01:00:14,486
is the only person in Korea
who can help you avoid jail time.

997
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:17,197
So, if you return Hash to us safely,

998
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:20,617
we'll represent you. Right, Mr. Yoon?

999
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:26,832
Thank you for offering to represent me.

1000
01:00:26,915 --> 01:00:28,959
But I have trouble trusting people.

1001
01:00:30,085 --> 01:00:32,254
So I'll hold onto Hash
until the case is settled.

1002
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:44,266
Advocacy isn't just a technical skill.
It's a comprehensive art form.

1003
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:47,602
If a lawyer is able to genuinely convey
their argument to a judge,

1004
01:00:47,686 --> 01:00:49,563
it may lead to a better outcome.

1005
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:52,482
If they defend you with passion,
they'll find a way.

1006
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:55,735
But with just a technical approach,
the outcome could be worse.

1007
01:00:55,819 --> 01:00:58,905
If you continue
to hold Hash hostage like that,

1008
01:00:58,989 --> 01:01:01,116
genuine advocacy will not be possible.

1009
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:02,868
If you return Hash to us safely,

1010
01:01:02,951 --> 01:01:05,328
we will sincerely
do our best to defend you

1011
01:01:05,412 --> 01:01:06,955
out of gratitude.

1012
01:01:07,038 --> 01:01:07,914
Right?

1013
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:21,970
I'm touched.

1014
01:01:23,471 --> 01:01:25,640
Yeah, let's do that.
I'll be relying on you.

1015
01:01:26,558 --> 01:01:27,642
All right.

1016
01:01:27,726 --> 01:01:29,436
You'll really defend me, right?

1017
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:35,525
Yes.

1018
01:01:35,609 --> 01:01:37,819
You know what'll happen
if you try anything funny, right?

1019
01:01:37,903 --> 01:01:39,029
And what will happen to Hash.

1020
01:01:39,112 --> 01:01:40,864
So far,

1021
01:01:40,947 --> 01:01:43,742
I've played with 14 dogs and 13 cats.

1022
01:01:43,825 --> 01:01:45,535
We can't let it become 15 dogs now.

1023
01:01:46,494 --> 01:01:47,704
I'll give it my all.

1024
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:50,207
That's more like it.

1025
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:52,250
Let's go.

1026
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:01,301
But you're not upset with me, are you?

1027
01:02:03,053 --> 01:02:04,429
We're on the same team now.

1028
01:02:04,512 --> 01:02:06,640
We can't have any lingering resentment.

1029
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:18,526
I'm counting on you.

1030
01:02:33,333 --> 01:02:36,461
I look forward to working
with you as well, Ms. Kang.

1031
01:02:41,508 --> 01:02:42,676
Bye, Hash.

1032
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:45,303
Let's play again next time. Bye!

1033
01:02:53,979 --> 01:02:54,938
Hash.

1034
01:02:56,481 --> 01:02:57,357
Hash.

1035
01:02:58,942 --> 01:02:59,901
Hash.

1036
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:03,071
I'm sorry.

1037
01:03:07,284 --> 01:03:09,536
I'm so sorry, Hash.

1038
01:03:11,538 --> 01:03:12,497
Hash.

1039
01:03:34,269 --> 01:03:36,229
Thankfully, he didn't suffer
any serious injuries,

1040
01:03:36,313 --> 01:03:38,398
but there's a hairline fracture
across the rib,

1041
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:42,402
and his gastrointestinal function
is impaired due to extreme stress.

1042
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:44,362
The fracture isn't that severe,

1043
01:03:44,446 --> 01:03:47,324
so it should heal with rest and treatment,

1044
01:03:47,407 --> 01:03:50,535
but right now, the priority
should be psychological comfort.

1045
01:03:56,583 --> 01:03:59,586
-My poor baby.
-What the hell is wrong with you?

1046
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:00,712
Lower your voice.

1047
01:04:01,629 --> 01:04:03,840
Did you not hear her say he needs peace?

1048
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:10,055
I'll take Hash tonight.

1049
01:04:11,139 --> 01:04:12,349
Okay?

1050
01:04:14,601 --> 01:04:15,477
Okay.

1051
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:22,317
Yoon Seok-hoon, we need to talk.

1052
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:26,196
I know it's not my place,
but you should do this later.

1053
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:30,617
Mr. Yoon had a very difficult day today.

1054
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:47,842
Mr. Yoon!

1055
01:04:54,516 --> 01:04:56,267
LOCATION, DISTANCE

1056
01:05:00,188 --> 01:05:01,981
-Sir, can you take the next right?
-Sure.

1057
01:05:07,612 --> 01:05:09,114
I'm counting on you.

1058
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:28,842
Here, kitties. I'm here.

1059
01:05:29,968 --> 01:05:31,719
Come on out. Let's eat.

1060
01:05:44,023 --> 01:05:47,277
So this is the security cam blind spot.

1061
01:05:48,862 --> 01:05:52,031
That's right. This is the spot.

1062
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:04,586
You bastard.

1063
01:06:12,677 --> 01:06:15,805
-What's going on there?
-Maybe he's the victim's family.

1064
01:06:15,889 --> 01:06:18,725
The victim is an elderly person
with no known relatives.

1065
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:20,643
Maybe the owner of a victimized pet?

1066
01:06:20,727 --> 01:06:21,936
Probably not.

1067
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:24,355
He did all that
to abandoned dogs and stray cats.

1068
01:06:24,439 --> 01:06:26,065
He knew that without family or owners,

1069
01:06:26,149 --> 01:06:28,026
he'd likely get off
with a slap on the wrist.

1070
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:30,111
That's why it's even more infuriating.

1071
01:06:30,195 --> 01:06:31,488
What a piece of shit.

1072
01:06:31,571 --> 01:06:33,406
He deserves to be beaten to a pulp.

1073
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:35,283
Oh, gosh.

1074
01:06:35,366 --> 01:06:36,659
Shouldn't we try to stop him?

1075
01:06:36,743 --> 01:06:38,244
Hold on. Let me finish this pastry.

1076
01:06:45,293 --> 01:06:46,294
You little shit.

1077
01:06:48,713 --> 01:06:50,089
Dad!

1078
01:06:52,509 --> 01:06:54,177
Dad hit Hash.

1079
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:56,387
It hurts so much, Dad!

1080
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:07,774
You messed with the wrong man.

1081
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:11,027
You eat all this.

1082
01:07:13,112 --> 01:07:15,198
Anyone can see the dogs are suffering.

1083
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:16,866
Damn psycho.

1084
01:07:19,786 --> 01:07:21,454
Let's see how you like it.

1085
01:07:23,081 --> 01:07:24,249
Hey!

1086
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:39,097
Jung Wu-sol, you have
the right to remain silent.

1087
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:41,224
You have the right
to request a habeas corpus review

1088
01:07:41,307 --> 01:07:42,892
and to defend yourself.

1089
01:07:43,518 --> 01:07:44,602
-Screw you.
-Stop moving!

1090
01:07:44,686 --> 01:07:46,896
Let me go!

1091
01:07:54,404 --> 01:07:55,488
Hey, Mister.

1092
01:08:01,327 --> 01:08:03,204
There are security cameras that way.

1093
01:08:03,288 --> 01:08:04,414
Go that way.

1094
01:08:08,001 --> 01:08:08,918
That man.

1095
01:08:09,836 --> 01:08:11,462
Why are you arresting him?

1096
01:08:11,546 --> 01:08:15,300
He beat up an elderly person
with no family, almost to death.

1097
01:08:16,009 --> 01:08:17,218
They're at death's door.

1098
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:45,997
How's Hash doing?

1099
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,457
He just fell asleep.

1100
01:08:48,166 --> 01:08:49,626
I told you to come inside.

1101
01:08:51,294 --> 01:08:52,211
I'm fine.

1102
01:08:53,921 --> 01:08:55,173
I'll pick him up tomorrow.

1103
01:08:56,507 --> 01:08:57,425
Okay.

1104
01:08:59,218 --> 01:09:00,428
What happened to you?

1105
01:09:05,433 --> 01:09:06,643
Bye.

1106
01:09:08,269 --> 01:09:09,771
Won-jun told me.

1107
01:09:12,190 --> 01:09:14,359
You filed a preliminary injunction?

1108
01:09:14,442 --> 01:09:16,110
Must you take it that far?

1109
01:09:18,529 --> 01:09:20,948
Then, am I supposed
to just let you take Hash overseas?

1110
01:09:21,032 --> 01:09:23,743
I was going to take my time
and discuss it with you.

1111
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:25,578
There's still a lot of time left.

1112
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:29,540
Won-jun just got ahead of himself
out of pettiness.

1113
01:09:29,624 --> 01:09:31,459
Even if it's not now, it will happen.

1114
01:09:31,542 --> 01:09:33,252
Then what am I supposed to do?

1115
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:34,837
Just abandon him in Korea?

1116
01:09:34,921 --> 01:09:35,922
"Abandon him"?

1117
01:09:36,547 --> 01:09:38,257
Leaving him with me is abandoning him?

1118
01:09:38,341 --> 01:09:39,217
No.

1119
01:09:39,884 --> 01:09:40,843
That's not what I meant.

1120
01:09:40,927 --> 01:09:43,596
How do I know you won't abandon Hash
all the way over there?

1121
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:44,931
What does that mean?

1122
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:46,391
Why not?

1123
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:48,768
You did that to your own child.

1124
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:52,397
How can I entrust Hash
to someone so heartless?

1125
01:09:55,566 --> 01:09:56,859
You're bringing that up now?

1126
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:00,863
Took you long enough.

1127
01:10:01,656 --> 01:10:03,157
Sure, I'm heartless.

1128
01:10:04,992 --> 01:10:06,703
I said I didn't want a baby.

1129
01:10:07,704 --> 01:10:09,914
I wanted it gone
the moment I got pregnant.

1130
01:10:13,543 --> 01:10:14,794
You're unbelievable.

1131
01:10:16,587 --> 01:10:18,381
You say that like it's nothing.

1132
01:10:18,464 --> 01:10:19,924
This isn't easy for me either.

1133
01:10:22,844 --> 01:10:26,222
I thought about it,
but when it came down to it,

1134
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:30,101
I hesitated.

1135
01:10:32,478 --> 01:10:33,813
I did hesitate.

1136
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:35,773
If you hadn't, you wouldn't be human.

1137
01:10:37,316 --> 01:10:40,403
I wasn't sure,
but the ultrasound signs weren't good.

1138
01:10:42,447 --> 01:10:44,824
There was a possibility
of a neural tube defect.

1139
01:10:46,117 --> 01:10:47,618
Putting us aside,

1140
01:10:48,786 --> 01:10:50,872
what about the baby being born with that?

1141
01:10:52,373 --> 01:10:53,750
Would they be happy?

1142
01:10:57,295 --> 01:10:58,463
You should've told me.

1143
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:00,840
You should've told me, Yeon-a.

1144
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:03,342
If I had, you would've told me to have it.

1145
01:11:04,844 --> 01:11:08,556
Disability or not,
whatever decision we made,

1146
01:11:09,807 --> 01:11:12,268
you would have been miserable as a result.

1147
01:11:12,894 --> 01:11:14,645
You still should've told me.

1148
01:11:15,563 --> 01:11:17,356
You should've made me understand you.

1149
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:18,775
Did you ever give me a chance?

1150
01:11:19,650 --> 01:11:21,861
Then you should've done
what you're doing now.

1151
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:23,112
Called me heartless,

1152
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:26,324
gotten angry, and asked me why
I did what I did.

1153
01:11:27,033 --> 01:11:29,494
Then, I could've at least
tried to explain myself.

1154
01:11:29,577 --> 01:11:32,622
You were busy avoiding the issue.

1155
01:11:33,164 --> 01:11:36,918
When a parenting show came on TV,
you would change the channel on purpose.

1156
01:11:37,001 --> 01:11:38,753
You avoided places with kids.

1157
01:11:40,213 --> 01:11:41,088
And intimacy.

1158
01:11:41,714 --> 01:11:42,757
That was…

1159
01:11:44,842 --> 01:11:46,803
for your sake. I was thinking of you.

1160
01:11:49,889 --> 01:11:51,682
I was giving you time to heal.

1161
01:11:51,766 --> 01:11:52,850
No.

1162
01:11:56,771 --> 01:11:58,523
No, that was so…

1163
01:12:00,066 --> 01:12:01,859
suffocating. I felt so trapped.

1164
01:12:03,194 --> 01:12:04,654
Regardless of your intention,

1165
01:12:05,196 --> 01:12:07,240
our relationship was neglected.

1166
01:12:10,284 --> 01:12:12,078
And we ended up in a rut.

1167
01:12:14,664 --> 01:12:15,998
No, not for me.

1168
01:12:26,467 --> 01:12:29,095
And to think we're just now
having this conversation.

1169
01:12:31,097 --> 01:12:32,765
You should've just never told me.

1170
01:12:37,103 --> 01:12:38,437
You…

1171
01:12:41,107 --> 01:12:42,191
You are so…

1172
01:13:57,391 --> 01:13:59,477
YOON SEOK-HOON

1173
01:14:01,812 --> 01:14:04,941
Isn't calling back after a missed call
the polite thing to do?

1174
01:14:05,024 --> 01:14:07,026
He just ran off.

1175
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:08,444
I'm so worried about him.

1176
01:14:16,619 --> 01:14:17,954
Maybe he's sleeping?

1177
01:14:19,830 --> 01:14:22,291
Hello? Mr. Yoon?

1178
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:24,543
You weren't sleeping?

1179
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:27,463
What?

1180
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:44,021
Mr. Yoon.

1181
01:14:50,236 --> 01:14:51,737
What happened?

1182
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:54,782
That looks really painful.

1183
01:14:55,658 --> 01:14:57,618
Is there a pharmacy nearby?

1184
01:15:11,799 --> 01:15:13,509
Gosh, how did he even get this?

1185
01:15:18,431 --> 01:15:19,390
Goodness.

1186
01:16:22,119 --> 01:16:25,122
BEYOND THE BAR

1187
01:16:25,206 --> 01:16:27,833
I don't want to live in a loveless family.

1188
01:16:27,917 --> 01:16:30,586
-This is a breach of contract.
-What kind of breach of contract?

1189
01:16:30,669 --> 01:16:33,464
We agreed to raise our child together
without a marital relationship.

1190
01:16:33,547 --> 01:16:34,924
It denies the essence of marriage.

1191
01:16:35,007 --> 01:16:36,467
It's void.

1192
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:38,302
-Let's talk for a minute.
-About what?

1193
01:16:38,385 --> 01:16:39,595
What? Now?

1194
01:16:39,678 --> 01:16:42,723
-What do you think you're doing?
-This is unacceptable.

1195
01:16:42,807 --> 01:16:44,141
You're proposing my dismissal?

1196
01:16:44,225 --> 01:16:45,601
You need my vote.

1197
01:16:45,684 --> 01:16:47,561
Mr. Yoon was there?

1198
01:16:47,645 --> 01:16:48,687
Why don't you like me?

1199
01:16:48,771 --> 01:16:50,189
-Seok-hoon…
-Seok-hoon?

1200
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:51,774
Just be my date tonight.

1201
01:16:57,957 --> 01:16:59,959
