1
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:35,953
BEYOND THE BAR

2
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:42,417
In this world, there are women
who make the impossible possible

3
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:44,253
just like Wonder Woman.

4
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:49,174
Some of these women excel in their careers

5
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:53,470
and maintain a happy family
at the same time

6
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:55,931
by being loving wives

7
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,433
and supportive mothers.

8
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:01,103
It's all because of you!
How dare you run that mouth!

9
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:05,357
Others rise above every hardship they face

10
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:08,277
-in their own ways.
-The principle that jointly earned assets…

11
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,281
We have with us
Professor Choi Eun-hee from SNU Law

12
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:15,826
to discuss the recent controversy
over cryptocurrency regulation.

13
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,119
Thank you for making time.

14
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,203
NEWS ANCHOR HAN SEOL-YEON

15
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:19,997
Thank you for having me.

16
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,915
The recent announcement by the government…

17
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:24,001
Seol-a! Hyo-min! Come here! Hurry!

18
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:24,960
What is it?

19
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:27,129
Your mom and Seol-a's sister
are on TV together!

20
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,422
They are!

21
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:32,509
Seol-yeon is always on TV
since she's the lead anchor of JTBS…

22
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:33,635
PROFESSOR CHOI EUN-HEE

23
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:37,180
…but even Ms. Choi's been
showing up on the news a lot lately.

24
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:38,724
Is she getting into politics?

25
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:43,061
With Ms. Choi getting busier,
who's going to be our domestic fairy now?

26
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:45,939
She won't come here for a while.

27
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:47,566
-Why not?
-Why not?

28
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:50,110
Is it because she threw away your plate?

29
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,695
Did you confront her about it?

30
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:54,281
What?

31
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:58,285
Seol-yeon looks especially radiant today.

32
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,829
My idol, Seol-yeon.

33
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:03,332
Ji-eun's such a Seol-yeon fangirl.

34
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:04,750
She just looks good on camera.

35
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:10,255
And others stand tall
in a league of their own,

36
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:12,007
recognized by all.

37
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:17,929
WONDER WOMAN

38
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:20,474
-Please continue.
-Yes.

39
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:23,268
This preparatory brief,
written by Mr. Yoon Seok-hoon himself,

40
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:27,481
includes classified material
that could severely harm MGC's case.

41
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:28,899
With this material,

42
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,276
Mr. Yoon is almost certain
to win the case.

43
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,237
But where on earth did Mr. Yoon

44
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,823
get hold of such a document?

45
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:41,286
Ms. Seo Hye-jin is
currently representing MGC.

46
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,415
So are you saying that Mr. Yoon
and Ms. Seo are in a relationship

47
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:50,295
and that she provided him

48
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:51,463
with the document?

49
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,548
Isn't that a reasonable suspicion?

50
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:56,426
How does a document
that MGC kept under strict security

51
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,595
end up getting leaked?

52
00:02:58,679 --> 00:02:59,888
Perhaps

53
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:02,599
Mr. Yoon could provide
a brief explanation regarding this.

54
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:06,978
I won't explain myself.

55
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:13,402
Instead, I will present evidence
that proves

56
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:15,904
Mr. Ko's claim is slanderous.

57
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:16,863
What?

58
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:20,742
And I request strict disciplinary action
for this malicious slander.

59
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,703
Okay.

60
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:24,788
If Mr. Ko's claim is true,

61
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,499
Mr. Yoon will face disciplinary action.

62
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,292
If it turns out to be slander,

63
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,004
then Mr. Ko will be
the one held accountable.

64
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:35,465
Do either of you have any objections?

65
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:36,591
No.

66
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:37,968
Me neither.

67
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,095
Mr. Yoon,

68
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,890
do you have any evidence
that this is slander?

69
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:46,017
This is the first time I've come across

70
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:47,477
the brief displayed on the screen.

71
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,606
And it's also the first time seeing
information unfavorable to MGC Securities.

72
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,483
That's nonsense.

73
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:57,028
Then how was this document
submitted to the court?

74
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:59,614
It was never submitted to the court.

75
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,324
What in the world…

76
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:05,787
Are you sure

77
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:08,248
that stolen document
was actually submitted to the court?

78
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:11,042
Feel free to verify it whenever you like.

79
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:16,882
What's going on?

80
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:19,259
Then

81
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,344
who wrote that document?

82
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,681
That should be fairly simple to check.

83
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:27,058
Since last year, every file has been

84
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:30,353
assigned a unique ID
as part of the enhanced security system.

85
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:31,438
Exactly.

86
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,607
There's a code
at the bottom of the document.

87
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:35,692
I didn't know about that.

88
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:41,239
If you trace that number,
you'll find out who wrote it.

89
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,118
Come here.

90
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,745
Get over here.

91
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:54,252
Who dares interrupt
the great one's gaming session?

92
00:04:57,756 --> 00:04:59,216
Hello, Kang Min-jun speaking.

93
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:02,928
Yes.

94
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,324
Mr. Kang Min-jun,

95
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,160
did you write this document?

96
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,412
I'm not sure if I'm following you.

97
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,998
I asked if you drafted this brief.

98
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:40,131
No,

99
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:41,466
I've never seen this document.

100
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,885
Every document has a unique ID,

101
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:46,263
and tracking that number

102
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:50,183
revealed that this one
was written and printed by you.

103
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,644
And you're saying
you know nothing about this?

104
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:02,487
Yes?

105
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:06,908
Okay.

106
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,663
The IT team has just verified

107
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,748
that a copy of the document

108
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:16,543
with the same number is stored

109
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:17,669
on your computer, Mr. Kang.

110
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:21,006
Are you still going to deny it?

111
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:26,511
Moron.

112
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:28,555
You get out, moron.

113
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,393
-Jeez.
-Min-jun.

114
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:34,394
What now?

115
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,396
I'm in trouble. My computer crashed again.

116
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,023
Again? Why?

117
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,442
I don't know. I need to send this
right now. I'm screwed.

118
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,360
It's not my problem. Ask someone else.

119
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:43,695
Everyone's swamped with work.

120
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:44,654
I can't!

121
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,406
Jeez.

122
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:49,326
How can I finish my work
and your construction payment draft

123
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,369
if you won't let me use your computer?

124
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,623
-Really?
-Hell yeah.

125
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:55,707
So move.

126
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,876
-You'll do it for me?
-Of course.

127
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,252
Don't mess with my game, though.

128
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:00,295
Never.

129
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,339
When did you level up like this?

130
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,383
I'll just have some coffee, then.

131
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,137
What a mess.

132
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,061
RETURN OF INVESTMENT FUNDS

133
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,106
EVIDENTIARY METHOD

134
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:32,869
Ms. Kim,

135
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:35,789
this is TS Insurance's brief
against MGC Securities.

136
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,666
-Please submit it to the court.
-Okay.

137
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:38,875
Make sure it's done securely.

138
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,168
-Sure.
-Thank you.

139
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:55,433
This is Lee Jin-woo.

140
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:56,768
Can you come to my office?

141
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:57,727
Sure.

142
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,618
RETURN OF INVESTMENT FUNDS

143
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:17,247
That was silly of me.

144
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:20,417
I gave you the wrong flash drive.

145
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,253
I'll email you the brief
to be submitted to the court.

146
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,296
-Can I have my flash drive back?
-Okay.

147
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,631
I'm so sorry.

148
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,263
Since you can't answer,

149
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:37,100
let me ask Mr. Ko Tae-seop.

150
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,437
Where did you get that document?

151
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:46,526
What do you mean?
Where would he get it from?

152
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,653
Mr. Kang Min-jun gave it to me,

153
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:50,196
and I reported it to Mr. Ko

154
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,783
since it seemed like a serious matter.

155
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,455
Mr. Kang Min-jun.

156
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,414
Yes?

157
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:01,082
Answer me.

158
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:04,711
Right.

159
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,133
Could I have a little time?

160
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,217
Okay.

161
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:13,887
I understand it's hard to answer,

162
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,014
given the nature of the situation.

163
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:21,436
If you don't mind, I'd like to give him
a day to think about it.

164
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,437
Well,

165
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,857
if it's okay with you,
then it's fine by me.

166
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:27,484
Okay.

167
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,403
Even if Mr. Yoon's claim is true…

168
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,572
Even if it's true,

169
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:35,200
isn't it inappropriate
to bring a female attorney,

170
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:38,495
especially one representing
the opposing party on a serious case,

171
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,872
to your own home

172
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,582
at such a late hour?

173
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:46,252
That?

174
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,463
The reason why Ms. Seo Hye-jin came to me

175
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:51,091
was to report workplace harassment.

176
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,801
And the person involved

177
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:55,011
was Hong Do-yun.

178
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,514
What?

179
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:06,147
Mr. Yoon,

180
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,400
please help me.

181
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:15,990
At first,

182
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,619
I thought he was scolding me
because I wasn't doing a good job.

183
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,996
Why do you make me repeat myself?

184
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,376
-I'm sorry.
-It's like we're collecting strays now.

185
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:31,047
That's why I worked even harder.

186
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,053
An elementary school kid
could do better than you.

187
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:38,972
I'm sorry.

188
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:43,059
-Get ready for our team dinner.
-Yes, sir.

189
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:45,395
-Hey.
-Yes, Mr. Hong.

190
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:48,857
This is a bit urgent.
I need to send it by tomorrow.

191
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,192
You'll have to miss the dinner.

192
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:55,488
It's fine.

193
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:56,447
I'm sorry.

194
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:58,158
-Let's go.
-Okay.

195
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,682
PLEASE REFER TO THE ABOVE INFORMATION
FOR YOUR WORK

196
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:30,565
It was a solid brief,
with nothing to criticize.

197
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:33,818
MR. HONG DO-YUN

198
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:36,779
What's with this line spacing? Gosh.

199
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,741
How can you not even get this right?

200
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,326
It's all messy.

201
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:44,078
Seriously?

202
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:46,873
Is this how you get things done?

203
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:51,127
-I'm sorry.
-Say it louder!

204
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,587
I'm sorry.

205
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,048
That's when I realized

206
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,509
it was harassment
just for the sake of harassment.

207
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:01,304
It was just too hard to endure.
I thought about reporting it,

208
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,348
but he holds so much power

209
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,350
that I had no idea how it might backfire.

210
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:09,103
I thought it could ruin my reputation
and make it harder to find a new job.

211
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,732
So I chose to leave
and began searching for a new job.

212
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:15,401
Ms. Seo.

213
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,405
-Yes.
-Are you free this evening?

214
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:24,244
-Yes, I'm free.
-Good.

215
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:26,663
I'm having dinner
with an important client tonight.

216
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,206
Would you like to join me?

217
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,542
Sure, Mr. Ko.

218
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,378
See you later, then.

219
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:43,554
What a great evening.

220
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:44,764
Thank you.

221
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,814
-Please help yourself.
-Let me pour you a glass.

222
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,065
What an honor.

223
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,363
Whenever I joined him on those dinners…

224
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,781
-Thank you.
-Bye.

225
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,992
…the harassment would stop for a while.

226
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,209
Honestly,

227
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:17,213
I never thought
you could be the life of the party.

228
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,382
I didn't know you had it in you.

229
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:20,925
Thank you.

230
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:23,428
Now that I see it,
you have a lovely smile.

231
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,351
I shouldn't say things like that nowadays.

232
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:31,769
It's fine.

233
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:33,062
I just…

234
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,063
Is it?

235
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:37,066
I just thought of it
as having a fancy meal

236
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,736
and went along once or twice a week.

237
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:42,655
Were you pressured
to entertain guests or--

238
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:43,823
No.

239
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,284
Not at first.

240
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,330
Most of the dinners
were formal business occasions,

241
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:51,664
but one time,

242
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,751
a client crossed the line,

243
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,295
so I just walked out.

244
00:13:58,421 --> 00:13:59,297
Hey.

245
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:04,469
Do you think I became a lawyer
to be treated like this?

246
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:05,470
I know.

247
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,263
Of course.

248
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:08,598
But that guy in there,

249
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,184
he went to law school
but never passed the bar

250
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,269
and makes ends meet working as a broker.

251
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:15,146
He has an inferiority complex.

252
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,023
That's why he acts like that
toward any lawyer,

253
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,608
man or woman.

254
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,276
It's not just you.

255
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,236
Do you think that justifies his actions?

256
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:27,116
You're cute when you're worked up.

257
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:29,744
Come on now. Don't be mad.

258
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,454
I'll make sure to tell him off.

259
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:33,456
When he said that,

260
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,626
I felt a bit strange.

261
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:40,463
That's when he started being nice to me.

262
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:44,634
A few more dinner gatherings
followed after that.

263
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:52,517
It's okay.

264
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,186
Say what you want to say.

265
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,108
I ended up…

266
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,945
sleeping with him.

267
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,156
I feel so ashamed

268
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,909
that I fell for his schemes,

269
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,161
but I didn't see it back then.

270
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:16,290
After that, he started inviting me
to dinner more openly and frequently.

271
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:18,084
He said his success
would benefit me as well.

272
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,628
I tried to walk away every time, but…

273
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:23,172
Instead of giving me actual work,

274
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,716
why do you keep insisting
on dinner meetings?

275
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,385
Dinner meetings are part of work too.

276
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,053
Just log it on your time sheet.

277
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:31,764
No, from now on,
I won't be joining you for dinner.

278
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:33,307
If you keep pressuring me,

279
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,310
I will report it as workplace harassment.

280
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:42,650
Workplace harassment?

281
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:45,695
Hey,

282
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,865
who would believe a woman
who messed around with a married man?

283
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:50,950
What?

284
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,369
If you report me,
do you think I'll stay quiet?

285
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,955
All I have to say
is that we're in a relationship

286
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,207
and you joined those dinners on your own.

287
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,293
So tell me. If that happens,
who ends up losing?

288
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,252
You or me?

289
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,963
We both may be criticized,
but women get it worse.

290
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,089
Do you know why?

291
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:08,050
People think, "Even if he's married,

292
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:10,803
what man could resist
someone as young, smart,

293
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:12,889
and pretty as you coming on to him?"

294
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:16,017
But you? Do you think
you could get married after that?

295
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,102
What utter nonsense.

296
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:22,398
He used that one encounter
to blackmail me.

297
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,318
I even thought about ending my life.

298
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,573
But I came to you as a last resort.

299
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,328
There are other female associates

300
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:38,122
who went through the same thing.

301
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,253
She is my client.

302
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:45,922
I will take care of it.

303
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:49,133
Look at you, acting up again.

304
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:50,927
Why are you being such a brat?

305
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,096
What's going on?

306
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:57,850
It's nothing.
Just be on your way. Damn it…

307
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:04,190
What do you think you're doing?

308
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,900
Jeez.

309
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:13,074
Ko Eun-jin, Kim Su-mi.

310
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,785
I guess your next target is Kang Hyo-min.

311
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:20,206
Start groveling
if you don't want to be buried.

312
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:28,297
I'll take care of it.

313
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:48,067
Four years ago, it was carried out
in a completely organized way.

314
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,777
But these days, it's much…

315
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:53,781
Ms. Kwon.

316
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,032
What are you…

317
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:59,662
Tell me what's going on right now.

318
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:01,330
It's…

319
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:04,250
We were in the middle of a team dinner.

320
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,253
You were having a team dinner
at a private entertainment bar,

321
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,672
and you only invited
the female associates?

322
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,842
The male attorneys were…

323
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,177
Mr. Choi Jeong-hyeok and Mr. Kim Ho-jin

324
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,263
had prior engagements,
so they couldn't join--

325
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,099
Mr. Choi Jeong-hyeok and Mr. Kim Ho-jin.

326
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,767
-Yes.
-Yes.

327
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:25,563
Was there something urgent that kept you
from joining the team dinner today?

328
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,149
-No, ma'am.
-No, ma'am.

329
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:34,697
Who are they?

330
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,202
Ms. Shin Eun-mi.

331
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,370
Who are these people?

332
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,006
I just asked who they were.

333
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,135
They're brokers.

334
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:08,481
You're aware that brokering legal services

335
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:11,776
through someone who's not a lawyer
is a criminal violation, aren't you?

336
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:13,944
I am, but…

337
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:15,863
But I…

338
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,199
Submit a resignation form by tomorrow.

339
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,742
File a criminal complaint

340
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:23,120
and pursue all legally available
disciplinary actions.

341
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:24,080
Yes, ma'am.

342
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:30,002
Ms. Kwon, please give me a chance
to explain myself at the office.

343
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,050
Ms. Kwon, that's…

344
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:40,930
How dare you

345
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,265
treat female Yullim lawyers

346
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,267
like hostesses?

347
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:47,853
You.

348
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:52,358
Don't ever set foot in the legal field,
even if you starve to death.

349
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:02,702
You should have given me a call.

350
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:05,621
You crazy bastard.

351
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:08,499
Are you serious?

352
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,420
Seriously?

353
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:22,888
Mr. Yoon.

354
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:26,183
Are you satisfied now?

355
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,522
Let's pin it all on Hong Do-yun

356
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,774
and have the statement say it was him

357
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:36,068
who made Kang Min-jun
carry out the scheme.

358
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,946
Why should I?

359
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:41,615
I'm the son of Ko Seung-cheol,
a founder of Yullim.

360
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:44,577
You're smart enough to know
that messing with me will get ugly.

361
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,954
Are you asking me for a favor
or threatening me?

362
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,500
I'm asking you for a favor.

363
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,294
Let's leave it at this for now.

364
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:59,133
-Is this how you ask for a favor?
-Damn it, then what?

365
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,301
Should I kneel or something?

366
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:06,432
The foundation of any deal
is giving and taking.

367
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,602
Assign Mr. Choi Hui-cheol

368
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,314
to DA Solutions.

369
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,317
What?

370
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,904
The position you pushed
Ms. Kwon Na-yeon into with your scheming.

371
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:25,159
Or would you like to go there
in Mr. Choi's place?

372
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:30,247
One more thing.

373
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,713
From now on, whatever I do,

374
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,091
you stay quiet and do nothing.

375
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,855
Big news! This is insane.

376
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:56,065
Mr. Hong Do-yun.

377
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,526
-He resigned.
-What?

378
00:21:58,609 --> 00:21:59,485
That's so sudden.

379
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:02,238
Security is packing up
Mr. Hong's things as we speak.

380
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,448
My goodness. What on earth…

381
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:05,699
-Right?
-What's going on?

382
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:08,410
But honestly,
everyone seems kind of relieved.

383
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:09,829
I bet.

384
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:11,455
HAN SEOL-A

385
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,877
Hey, Seol-a.

386
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:21,465
Seol-yeon is?

387
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:24,218
Which police station? I'll be right there.

388
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,556
Mr. Choi Min-gu. Hey!

389
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,517
What are you looking at?

390
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,895
Answer me. Where were you
at two o'clock last Wednesday?

391
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:37,690
So it is her!
Han Seol-yeon, the news anchor!

392
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:40,067
-He's right.
-It's Han Seol-yeon.

393
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,652
Han Seol-yeon!

394
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:42,945
Don't take pictures!

395
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:43,904
Put it down.

396
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:45,656
-Give it to me.
-What's going on?

397
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:48,242
Be quiet. And sit down, all of you.

398
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:49,869
Seol-yeon!

399
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,251
Seol-yeon.

400
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,881
-Seol-a.
-Are you okay?

401
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:03,632
Open the door.

402
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:04,800
I can't.

403
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:06,385
I'm Ms. Han Seol-yeon's attorney.

404
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,137
You see this?

405
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,763
She threw a huge fit.

406
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,474
She was so strong.

407
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:15,561
I tried to go easy on her
since she's a public figure,

408
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,104
but she was uncontrollable.

409
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,316
Seol-yeon,

410
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,109
what happened?

411
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:24,695
I don't remember.

412
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:28,407
I took the medicine prescribed
by my psychiatrist, fell asleep,

413
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,868
and when I came to,

414
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:33,621
I was here.

415
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,706
What happened?

416
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:39,460
She assaulted her husband
and was arrested on the spot.

417
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,756
She'll be facing a warrant
for aggravated assault within 48 hours.

418
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,258
No, wait a minute.

419
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:47,760
That makes no sense.

420
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,930
My sister has never even cursed at anyone

421
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:52,598
or gotten into a fight.

422
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,643
What do you mean, aggravated assault?

423
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:57,394
And she targeted her husband?

424
00:23:57,478 --> 00:24:01,065
All the evidence was secured,
and she was arrested on the spot.

425
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:06,695
Where is her husband?

426
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:10,199
The victim is getting treated
at the hospital now,

427
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,951
and things aren't looking great.

428
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:20,250
News anchor Han Seol-yeon
was taken into emergency custody

429
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:22,378
for allegedly assaulting her husband.

430
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:23,879
She was just spotted

431
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:26,548
leaving the police station
after questioning.

432
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:30,427
Ms. Han won the public's heart
with her bold professional presence

433
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:32,221
and family-oriented nature.

434
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:36,767
The pretrial detention hearing
to decide whether a warrant will be issued

435
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,895
is scheduled for 10:30 a.m. on Wednesday.

436
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:42,606
Unbelievable.

437
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,274
So you're saying Ms. Han Seol-yeon

438
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:46,777
is your roommate's older sister, right?

439
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,028
Yes.

440
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:49,530
We're not just roommates.

441
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:51,657
We've been like sisters
since elementary school.

442
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,117
My gosh.

443
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:56,286
She doesn't seem like
the kind of person who'd hit her husband.

444
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:58,122
She's not.

445
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:00,416
Something feels off.

446
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,377
Let's start by preparing
for the warrant review hearing.

447
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,379
Okay, I'm on it.

448
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:08,007
COURT

449
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:10,843
The defendant lives
at a permanent address.

450
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:14,263
She has a stable job
and resides with her family.

451
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,390
There's no flight risk.

452
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,350
We respectfully ask the court

453
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:20,686
to reject the motion
for a detention warrant.

454
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,438
Understood.

455
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:26,400
There is insufficient evidence to justify
the need for pretrial detention.

456
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:28,652
The request
for a detention warrant is dismissed.

457
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:30,404
PROSECUTION

458
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:41,165
Don't worry.

459
00:25:41,832 --> 00:25:43,584
There's a strong chance of acquittal.

460
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,086
We can claim mental incapacity.

461
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:48,464
Since she was under the influence

462
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:51,425
of psychiatric drugs
and not in a conscious state,

463
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:54,636
a mental incapacity defense
could result in a not-guilty verdict.

464
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:58,140
Han Seol-a, don't you trust me?

465
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:00,184
It's me, Kang Hyo-min.

466
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:02,519
Yes.

467
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,605
Don't worry.

468
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,486
It's not easy to claim mental incapacity.

469
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,654
If mental incapacity is acknowledged,

470
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:14,823
the court is required to rule not guilty.

471
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:17,534
That's why the court
has to be extra cautious,

472
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:20,120
and the trial process
is likely to take longer.

473
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:22,790
Even if she's acquitted
in the first trial,

474
00:26:22,873 --> 00:26:26,126
the trial will likely continue
if the prosecution files an appeal.

475
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:30,089
Realistically, it's much better
to plead diminished capacity

476
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:32,424
and aim for a suspended sentence.

477
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,259
No, Mr. Yoon.

478
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:36,345
It has to be mental incapacity.

479
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,138
She's a famous news anchor.

480
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:40,224
Unless she's acquitted, it's pointless.

481
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:42,142
You know as well as I do

482
00:26:42,226 --> 00:26:43,227
that there's a risk.

483
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:46,480
I know. But still,

484
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:49,441
she has to be acquitted.

485
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:53,737
Ms. Han Seol-yeon is family
and the pride of my lifelong friend.

486
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:58,033
I couldn't bear to see her
get a criminal record.

487
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:01,745
Please go for the mental incapacity plea.

488
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,040
I'll think about it.

489
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:08,752
First, we need to consult
Ms. Han's doctor.

490
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,266
Hello.

491
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:25,269
Yes, that's right.

492
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:27,646
Is that so?

493
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:30,232
I'll be right there.

494
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:32,276
It won't take long.

495
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,236
Yes.

496
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,155
See you soon.

497
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,097
Get in.

498
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:03,557
It's okay. I'll take a cab.

499
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,601
Get in. I'll drop you off.

500
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,440
Thanks.

501
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:18,447
But this sure is amazing.

502
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,158
I was able to reach you
a day before emigrating.

503
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:23,368
Funny how the internet makes
things like this possible.

504
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:24,411
Indeed.

505
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:29,208
Here.

506
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:31,919
It broke a long time ago,

507
00:28:32,002 --> 00:28:34,588
and I couldn't fix it
since it's discontinued.

508
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:36,965
But it ended up being useful again.

509
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:37,966
Right.

510
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:40,677
I bought it for my honeymoon.

511
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:44,014
I didn't know how to use it back then,
so I saved everything on the camera.

512
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:45,974
I switched to external storage later on,

513
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:48,644
but I never deleted
what was originally saved on the camera.

514
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:49,895
I see.

515
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:51,313
Funny, isn't it?

516
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:54,024
It's like it was all meant to happen.

517
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:58,445
You can't view the footage
on any other device.

518
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:00,072
To see the videos,

519
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:03,825
you have to get it fixed,
but I'm not sure if that's possible.

520
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:05,744
I'll give it a shot.

521
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,622
-Sure.
-Thank you so much.

522
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:12,918
I should get going now.

523
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:13,877
Right.

524
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:15,587
Thank you so much.

525
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,071
You're still here?

526
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:42,030
Yes.

527
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,033
What's this?

528
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:45,993
A camcorder.

529
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:47,202
But it's broken.

530
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:51,623
They said it was discontinued long ago,
and there are no replacement parts.

531
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:54,418
But I'll try. You never know.

532
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:56,753
Why waste time doing legwork?

533
00:29:58,338 --> 00:29:59,881
I'm the youngest of six kids,

534
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:02,009
my dad is the youngest of seven,

535
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:04,219
and my mom's
the first child of eight kids.

536
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:05,762
What are you saying?

537
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:08,015
-It's a huge family.
-Yes.

538
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:11,310
My parents' family group chats
have over 200 people combined.

539
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:12,269
And?

540
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:14,187
With those 200 people on your side,

541
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:16,690
there's nothing you can't find in Korea.

542
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:19,484
Interesting. Can you get to the point now?

543
00:30:19,568 --> 00:30:20,485
Hang on.

544
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,782
Done.

545
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:29,494
Get your stuff.

546
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:31,913
-Follow me.
-To where?

547
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:33,290
Just follow me. Let's go.

548
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:34,791
What are you…

549
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:40,297
Can you fix it?

550
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:43,550
I'll need to open it up and see,

551
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:47,012
but I collect old camcorders,

552
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:50,682
so I guess I can swap in parts
from another device to make it work.

553
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:53,101
Really? As long as you fix it,

554
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:55,020
money isn't an issue.

555
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:56,104
Okay.

556
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:58,231
Leave it with me.

557
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,234
How long will it take?

558
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,112
I'm swamped with work.

559
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:05,614
Maybe a month?

560
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,324
Two months?

561
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:08,867
I'll call you when I'm done.

562
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:15,999
I'm Mr. Lee Seok-hwa's nephew.

563
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:17,667
What?

564
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:19,669
You're Seok-hwa's nephew?

565
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:21,129
Yes. Hold on.

566
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:30,013
Hi, Uncle. It's Jin-woo.

567
00:31:30,097 --> 00:31:32,349
I'm at the place you recommended.

568
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:34,559
Right. I'll put him on the phone.

569
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:37,938
It's my Uncle, Lee Seok-hwa.

570
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:40,899
Hello.

571
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:43,610
Seok-hwa!

572
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:44,820
Have you been well?

573
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,822
My gosh.

574
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:50,033
You should have told me
if you knew your nephew was coming.

575
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:51,451
Is that so?

576
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:55,080
My goodness.
Don't you worry about a thing.

577
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:56,623
I'll get it done right away.

578
00:31:57,499 --> 00:32:00,210
Sure. Let's go grab a drink soon.

579
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,715
So, you're Seok-hwa's nephew.

580
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:07,384
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

581
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:09,344
I should have, right?
How long will it take?

582
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:11,138
When do you need it by?

583
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:12,639
As soon as possible.

584
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:14,141
Can it be done today?

585
00:32:14,224 --> 00:32:16,393
Okay.
Let me open it up and call you.

586
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:17,686
Okay.

587
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:18,687
Thank you.

588
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:19,855
-Thank you.
-Sure.

589
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:24,359
Let's go get something to eat.

590
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:29,531
You're lucky to have a big family.

591
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:32,492
-Am I?
-Of course.

592
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:33,827
How about your family?

593
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,036
I don't have one.

594
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,329
What?

595
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:41,793
My dad passed away too soon,
so it was just my mom and me.

596
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:45,464
But she passed away when I was 23.

597
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:50,677
Don't give me that look.

598
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:52,679
It's a bit much.

599
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:55,515
I didn't do anything.

600
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:58,602
Gosh.

601
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,480
I'd happily give you half my family.

602
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:03,899
Scratch that.

603
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:07,319
You could join our family.

604
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,738
Then what should we…

605
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,158
Should we get married?

606
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:16,077
Do you hear yourself right now?

607
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:19,498
I mean…

608
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,251
What's in the camcorder
that you're so desperate to see?

609
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:31,843
The first and only trip I ever took
with my mom was to Jeju Island,

610
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:33,970
and I lost my camera
the moment we arrived.

611
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:37,933
There was this couple in our group tour,

612
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,519
and we agreed
to take videos of each other.

613
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:42,270
So we recorded videos.

614
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:45,482
But when I emailed them later
to get the videos, it bounced back.

615
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:47,484
It was probably the wrong email.

616
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,612
Back then, I just shrugged it off.
What could I do?

617
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,822
But after my mom passed,

618
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,534
I missed her so much.

619
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:58,954
Mom was always shy
about getting her photos taken,

620
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,456
so I only had a few old pictures of her.

621
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:04,543
She always took pictures of me,
never of herself.

622
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:07,087
That's when I remembered our Jeju trip.

623
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:09,464
So I spent years posting online,

624
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:11,174
trying to find that couple.

625
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:12,801
So the lady who gave you the camcorder…

626
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:13,843
Yes.

627
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:16,680
Isn't it a miracle?

628
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:19,641
It's like a gift from my mom.

629
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,525
Hello.

630
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:30,694
Okay. We'll be right there.

631
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:33,613
CAMERA REPAIRS, USED CAMERA PURCHASES
FILMS, BATTERIES

632
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,046
We're on our honeymoon.

633
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:53,341
-Could you film us together?
-Sure.

634
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:56,177
Excuse me.

635
00:34:57,137 --> 00:34:58,138
I'm sorry, but…

636
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:05,645
I'm on a trip with my mom.

637
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:08,898
But we lost our luggage right after
we arrived, so we don't have a camera.

638
00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:10,483
That's too bad.

639
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:13,570
If you don't mind, I'll keep filming you.

640
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,989
Could you film me and my mom as well?

641
00:35:17,324 --> 00:35:18,199
Mom.

642
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:19,576
Look over here.

643
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,620
-Loosen up a bit.
-Look at the camera.

644
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:27,000
Mom, it's not a photo. It's a video.

645
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,962
All right, strike a pose.

646
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:32,255
Let's make a "V."

647
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:39,179
What's it like traveling
with your daughter for the first time?

648
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:43,224
I'm over the moon. I'm so happy.

649
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:47,646
What's it like to see
all your hard work pay off,

650
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:50,315
with your only daughter now at SNU?

651
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:53,485
It feels great!

652
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:57,614
I'm so happy!

653
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:06,456
Are you crying, Mom?

654
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:07,540
No.

655
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:11,544
Tears of joy, tears of sorrow…

656
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:14,047
Your eyes never stay dry.

657
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:16,966
Don't cry.

658
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:17,652
Go ahead and cry out loud. It's all right.

659
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:42,010
Could you say that again?

660
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:46,055
Ms. Han Seol-yeon has what?

661
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,141
TRAUMA CAUSED BY DOMESTIC ABUSE

662
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:49,893
Battered Woman Syndrome.

663
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:54,397
It looks like her husband's abuse
went on for ten years.

664
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:55,982
Women exposed to long-term abuse

665
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:58,735
often suffer physically and mentally,

666
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:01,321
showing signs of depression,

667
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:04,741
anxiety, and sleep disorders.

668
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:08,745
This was Ms. Han Seol-yeon's condition
on her first visit.

669
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:13,958
She had a rib fracture
that would take seven weeks to heal.

670
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:18,546
Apparently, she told her doctor
it happened in a car crash.

671
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:20,340
Ms. Han said

672
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:23,551
she blacked out
after taking her medication.

673
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:24,594
What was she given?

674
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:27,430
It's a medication containing
zolpidem and diazepam.

675
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:29,808
She developed a tolerance
to her earlier medication,

676
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:32,018
so we switched her
to this about a month ago.

677
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:33,770
Can this medication cause

678
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:36,439
blackouts as a side effect?

679
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:37,440
Yes.

680
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:40,068
There have been reports of blackouts

681
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,611
lasting anywhere from four

682
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:44,447
to twelve hours
after taking this medication.

683
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:46,699
I see.

684
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:24,946
You piece of shit.

685
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:30,618
Seol-a!

686
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,888
Prosecutor, please state the charges.

687
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:51,264
HUSBAND ASSAULT CASE
FIRST HEARING

688
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:56,352
On May 26, 2025, the defendant assaulted
her husband, Han Seong-su,

689
00:39:56,436 --> 00:40:00,106
at their home by throwing objects
and striking him directly,

690
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:02,901
causing injuries
that required 12 weeks of recovery.

691
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:06,029
What is the defendant's position
on the charges?

692
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:08,948
The defendant claims mental incapacity,

693
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:12,035
stating she has no memory of the incident

694
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:13,912
after taking her prescribed medication.

695
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:15,705
According to the victim's statement,

696
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:17,957
the defendant called him by name,
cursed at him,

697
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:20,168
and even called an ambulance
right after the assault.

698
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,587
Therefore, we argue

699
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,589
that the defendant was not incapable

700
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:26,591
of distinguishing right from wrong

701
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:28,384
or making decisions

702
00:40:28,468 --> 00:40:31,387
but merely had diminished capacity.

703
00:40:31,471 --> 00:40:33,890
We request a psychiatric evaluation
of the defendant's condition

704
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:35,516
after taking the prescribed medication

705
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:39,562
to determine whether she was in a state
of mental incapacity during the incident.

706
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:42,148
What is the prosecution's position?

707
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:45,068
While I question
the necessity of the evaluation,

708
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,946
I will follow Your Honor's judgment.

709
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:50,990
All right, we'll commission
the evaluation.

710
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:54,369
Counsel, prepare and submit
the evaluation request form.

711
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,908
Get some rest, Seol-yeon.

712
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:19,620
Did you see me at the hospital today?

713
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:22,790
It's okay.

714
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:25,626
You don't have to take
the medication anymore.

715
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:28,296
I'm going to be by your side.

716
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:32,967
Did you see me too, Hyo-min?

717
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:34,969
Yes.

718
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:39,891
Was it terrible?

719
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:49,233
I like that version of myself.

720
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:52,320
What?

721
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:54,322
When I take that medicine,

722
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:56,949
it's like I turn into Wonder Woman.

723
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:58,993
You know me.

724
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:02,830
I've never even raised my voice
at someone in my whole life.

725
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:05,875
I know.

726
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:10,546
But in that video, I was different.

727
00:43:11,047 --> 00:43:13,424
I shouted when I felt like it

728
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:15,134
and let my rage out
without holding back.

729
00:43:15,218 --> 00:43:16,219
"Video"?

730
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,516
What do you mean?

731
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:23,017
What video?

732
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:27,271
To be honest…

733
00:43:57,927 --> 00:43:59,095
It's installed.

734
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:00,471
-Thank you.
-Sure.

735
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:04,725
At first, I installed a security camera
to see what happens

736
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:07,603
when I black out.

737
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:47,894
I kept replaying the video,
again and again.

738
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:50,021
I looked like

739
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:52,815
Wonder Woman in the video.

740
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:58,196
It felt like
I was Wonder Woman punishing a villain.

741
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:02,158
I've never been able
to raise my voice at anyone before,

742
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:04,285
so I couldn't believe what I was seeing.

743
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:06,662
But it felt like

744
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:10,625
something inside me
had finally been set free.

745
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,712
I could finally breathe.

746
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:23,638
After the incident,
I was setting the table for my husband,

747
00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:28,059
and he flinched when I got close,

748
00:45:29,352 --> 00:45:30,561
just like I used to.

749
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:39,695
A few days later,
he came home drunk again…

750
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:44,951
and he hit me.

751
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:50,248
I was depressed and couldn't sleep,

752
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:54,210
so even though I knew
what the medication would do,

753
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:55,670
I took it on purpose.

754
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:58,965
I wanted to turn into Wonder Woman
and teach him a lesson.

755
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:01,300
Seol-yeon,

756
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:04,845
did you tell anyone else about this?

757
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:06,639
No.

758
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:08,224
Seol-a,

759
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:09,725
let's talk for a minute.

760
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:15,231
What are you saying?

761
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:17,358
What's "voluntary intoxication"?

762
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:19,860
It's a voluntary act
leading to incapacity.

763
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:24,365
It's deliberately putting yourself
in a particular state,

764
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:26,909
knowing what might happen.

765
00:46:26,993 --> 00:46:30,454
For example,
if someone plans to commit murder

766
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:32,915
and drinks on purpose
to calm their nerves or gain courage,

767
00:46:32,999 --> 00:46:36,877
they can't claim diminished capacity
just because they were drunk.

768
00:46:36,961 --> 00:46:41,215
Normally, they could claim
diminished capacity due to intoxication,

769
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:44,719
but since they drank on purpose,
it doesn't count.

770
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:49,515
They put themselves in that state,
so they can't avoid responsibility.

771
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:51,934
So you're saying Seol-yeon
taking the pills

772
00:46:52,018 --> 00:46:53,978
and turning aggressive
counts as that too?

773
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:55,479
Yes.

774
00:46:55,563 --> 00:46:58,941
If she took the pills on purpose
to become like Wonder Woman,

775
00:46:59,025 --> 00:47:01,485
the prosecutor could reject

776
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:03,446
her mental incapacity plea

777
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:06,198
as an act of voluntary intoxication.

778
00:47:06,282 --> 00:47:10,202
Does that mean she can't be acquitted
by pleading mental incapacity?

779
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:12,663
Yes.

780
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:27,928
Hyo-min.

781
00:47:30,598 --> 00:47:31,807
Do you remember?

782
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:35,227
Back when you asked me
to teach you sign language.

783
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:38,647
INTRO TO KOREAN SIGN LANGUAGE

784
00:47:38,731 --> 00:47:40,483
Okay, fine.

785
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:42,485
But…

786
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:44,528
under one condition.

787
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:45,654
Sure.

788
00:47:45,738 --> 00:47:47,698
Just once in your life,

789
00:47:48,491 --> 00:47:50,743
grant me a favor, no matter what I ask.

790
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:52,036
A favor?

791
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:53,829
Pinky promise.

792
00:47:54,497 --> 00:47:55,373
Okay.

793
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:02,421
I'm asking that favor now.

794
00:48:04,632 --> 00:48:06,384
-Seol-a.
-I said, "no matter what."

795
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:13,099
There are medical ethics
that you follow as a doctor,

796
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:15,976
-and as a lawyer, I--
-"Just once in your life."

797
00:48:17,353 --> 00:48:18,437
"No matter what."

798
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:21,399
You always said it yourself

799
00:48:21,482 --> 00:48:23,401
that the law isn't always just.

800
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:27,446
You saw what my brother-in-law did.

801
00:48:28,072 --> 00:48:30,366
Just thinking about it
makes my blood boil.

802
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:33,994
If I had known,
I'd have beaten him to a pulp too.

803
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:37,415
Is it justice for Seol-yeon
to go to prison for that?

804
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:39,417
Is that what you call justice?

805
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:58,185
It's been ten minutes.

806
00:48:58,269 --> 00:48:59,270
If it's hard to say…

807
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:00,771
It was voluntary intoxication.

808
00:49:01,564 --> 00:49:02,940
Sorry?

809
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:06,318
Han Seol-yeon's assault case.

810
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:08,988
Ms. Han took the medication on purpose.

811
00:49:10,156 --> 00:49:12,616
She knew the medication
would make her violent,

812
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:16,287
and she took it on purpose
to fight back against her husband.

813
00:49:16,996 --> 00:49:18,038
Did she say that herself?

814
00:49:19,415 --> 00:49:20,416
Yes.

815
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:22,334
She probably didn't realize

816
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:25,004
this would work against her.

817
00:49:25,713 --> 00:49:27,006
Who else knows about this?

818
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:28,716
No one yet.

819
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:30,092
Why did you tell me?

820
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:31,969
I'm confused.

821
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:35,639
I don't know what to do.

822
00:49:36,265 --> 00:49:39,185
I have no intention of micromanaging
a junior lawyer's ethics.

823
00:49:40,019 --> 00:49:42,605
I'll pretend I didn't hear that,
so you decide.

824
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:44,398
If I could've made a decision--

825
00:49:44,482 --> 00:49:45,483
You would have.

826
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,655
Then let me tell you my perspective.

827
00:49:52,323 --> 00:49:53,699
To me,

828
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:56,994
justice means protecting the people
I have to protect.

829
00:49:57,995 --> 00:49:59,747
And for that, I'd do anything.

830
00:50:00,915 --> 00:50:03,250
Even if it's something illegal?

831
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:05,669
As a lawyer, it would be wrong.

832
00:50:05,753 --> 00:50:08,005
Within the bounds of the law, of course.

833
00:50:12,176 --> 00:50:15,471
But if it's a loophole disguised
as legality, then I won't hold back.

834
00:50:21,936 --> 00:50:24,355
Don't think like a small mind
trapped in dogma.

835
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:26,815
Try to see the bigger picture.

836
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:38,452
Seol-a.

837
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:41,288
Let's meet at Seol-yeon's house.

838
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:42,248
Okay.

839
00:50:50,631 --> 00:50:52,424
You can never tell anyone

840
00:50:52,508 --> 00:50:54,760
what you told us.

841
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:56,053
-Okay?
-Okay.

842
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:57,930
Not the prosecutor

843
00:50:58,013 --> 00:50:59,431
or your doctor.

844
00:50:59,515 --> 00:51:00,474
No one.

845
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:01,600
Okay.

846
00:51:03,269 --> 00:51:05,563
Do you still have the security camera?

847
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:08,315
Yes.

848
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:09,817
Where's the video?

849
00:51:11,944 --> 00:51:13,028
In my cell phone.

850
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,658
I'll take this.

851
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:22,538
You can withhold statements
that may be used against you,

852
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:24,081
but you can't give false testimony.

853
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:25,499
Okay.

854
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:28,043
If you're asked a question
that could hurt your case,

855
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:30,462
you can exercise
your right to remain silent.

856
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:33,507
Okay. I won't lie.

857
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:42,099
HUSBAND ASSAULT CASE
SECOND HEARING

858
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:44,184
Case number 2025-Gohap-250916.

859
00:51:44,268 --> 00:51:46,270
The court is now in session.

860
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:49,857
The results of the evaluation
requested by the defense have arrived.

861
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:51,984
What's your opinion, Counsel?

862
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:54,612
As seen in the evaluation report,

863
00:51:54,695 --> 00:51:57,448
the defendant completely lost the ability

864
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:59,158
to distinguish right from wrong

865
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:01,869
or to make decisions
after taking the prescribed medication.

866
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:05,831
She has no memory
of what happened during the 30 minutes

867
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:07,791
after taking the medication.

868
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:11,128
As noted in the report,
the drug's side effects likely suppressed

869
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:12,838
frontal lobe function,

870
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:14,798
leading to violent behavior.

871
00:52:15,424 --> 00:52:19,219
Therefore, the assault in question
was not the result

872
00:52:19,303 --> 00:52:21,930
of the defendant's free will,

873
00:52:22,014 --> 00:52:25,267
and she should be found not guilty
by reason of mental incapacity.

874
00:52:25,893 --> 00:52:26,852
As previously requested,

875
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:29,355
we will now proceed
with the questioning of the evaluator.

876
00:52:29,438 --> 00:52:31,106
I'll allow it.

877
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,068
On May 29,

878
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:37,988
did you observe the defendant's condition
after she took her psychiatric medication?

879
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:39,448
Yes.

880
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:40,491
WITNESS

881
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:44,453
Your Honor, this is
the footage recorded that day.

882
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:59,510
How can she not remember that?

883
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:03,347
She looks out of her mind.

884
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:07,434
Look how she threw the pillow.

885
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:16,985
How was the defendant during this period?

886
00:53:17,069 --> 00:53:18,529
She was in a blackout state,

887
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:21,907
and she showed impulsive behavior
and extreme violence.

888
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:24,702
Have other patients ever displayed

889
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:28,205
violence or aggressive behavior
during blackouts?

890
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:30,082
No, they haven't.

891
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:33,043
Ms. Han Seol-yeon
is a highly unusual case.

892
00:53:33,127 --> 00:53:34,503
Could you elaborate?

893
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:37,256
We performed a brain MRI
to analyze changes

894
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:39,299
in Ms. Han's brain activity.

895
00:53:39,383 --> 00:53:40,592
BEFORE & AFTER MEDICATION

896
00:53:40,676 --> 00:53:43,554
The top scan is Ms. Han's usual brain MRI.

897
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:45,013
And the bottom one

898
00:53:45,097 --> 00:53:49,101
is the brain MRI taken
after she took the prescribed medication.

899
00:53:49,727 --> 00:53:53,063
That area marked in red

900
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:56,525
is the front part of the frontal lobe,
the prefrontal cortex.

901
00:53:57,151 --> 00:54:00,738
This area controls emotions,
suppresses impulses,

902
00:54:00,821 --> 00:54:02,865
and helps with social judgment.

903
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:06,702
Many experts refer
to the prefrontal cortex

904
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:09,037
as the brain's braking system.

905
00:54:09,121 --> 00:54:14,168
In other words, the prefrontal cortex
controls and regulates

906
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:17,921
aggressive or impulsive behavior.

907
00:54:18,005 --> 00:54:19,173
I see.

908
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:22,801
But it was confirmed
that the defendant's frontal lobe activity

909
00:54:22,885 --> 00:54:26,722
dropped noticeably
after taking the medication.

910
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:29,099
As you can see,

911
00:54:29,183 --> 00:54:33,187
the area that should appear
bright looks faded.

912
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:38,859
It means the defendant's frontal lobe
was not functioning properly.

913
00:54:39,485 --> 00:54:40,486
What does that mean?

914
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:45,491
It's presumed that the suppressed function

915
00:54:45,574 --> 00:54:46,742
led to her aggression.

916
00:54:48,035 --> 00:54:49,203
I see.

917
00:54:50,746 --> 00:54:51,663
No further questions.

918
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:56,877
Defendant,

919
00:54:57,795 --> 00:55:00,464
can you tell us your first
and last memories from that day?

920
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:05,427
I was watching my favorite show,
which ends at 11 p.m.,

921
00:55:05,511 --> 00:55:07,012
and I fell asleep.

922
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:10,474
Next thing I know,

923
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:13,727
I was handcuffed in a holding cell.

924
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:19,817
Do you not remember anything at all?

925
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:21,026
No, I don't.

926
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:23,529
According to the police,
once the cuffs were on,

927
00:55:23,612 --> 00:55:26,156
you asked if you could take the handbag

928
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,449
that was on the table.

929
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:33,247
They're trying to frame it
as diminished capacity.

930
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:34,540
It looks like it.

931
00:55:49,096 --> 00:55:53,350
Case number 2025-Gohap-250916.

932
00:55:54,226 --> 00:55:57,396
Defendant Han Seol-yeon,
the court will now deliver the verdict.

933
00:56:04,987 --> 00:56:06,947
The defendant is found not guilty.

934
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:18,625
The summary of this ruling
is hereby announced.

935
00:56:26,884 --> 00:56:29,344
A toast to the great Kang Hyo-min

936
00:56:29,428 --> 00:56:31,722
and to Yoon Seok-hoon,
who isn't with us today

937
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:34,433
but helped make that acquittal happen!

938
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:36,018
Cheers!

939
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:37,686
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

940
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:46,737
-That video…
-Yes?

941
00:56:47,863 --> 00:56:49,281
Did you delete it?

942
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:51,325
Not yet. I will.

943
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:52,326
Really?

944
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:54,953
Then before you erase it…

945
00:56:59,625 --> 00:57:00,834
Hey!

946
00:57:00,918 --> 00:57:03,378
Your husband is home!

947
00:57:07,007 --> 00:57:08,842
What are you doing at this hour?

948
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:12,596
Can't you hear me?

949
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:13,847
Say something.

950
00:57:15,641 --> 00:57:19,811
Why the heck are you eating at this hour?

951
00:57:20,312 --> 00:57:21,563
You look like a mess.

952
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:23,982
Han Seol-yeon!

953
00:57:24,066 --> 00:57:25,359
Have you lost it?

954
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:29,655
When someone asks you something,
you should answer!

955
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:44,962
Be ready to go to hell,
you fucking bastard.

956
00:57:45,045 --> 00:57:48,632
I'll crush you just like you crushed me.

957
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:49,758
You son of a bitch!

958
00:58:24,376 --> 00:58:25,919
Do we have ramyeon at home?

959
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,088
I think so.

960
00:58:29,256 --> 00:58:31,550
Should I cook, or do you want to do it?

961
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:33,468
I'll do it.

962
00:58:37,431 --> 00:58:38,640
What about beer?

963
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:40,350
We don't have any.

964
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:47,941
Where are you going?

965
00:58:48,025 --> 00:58:49,026
To get some beer.

966
00:58:50,402 --> 00:58:51,862
Get some chips too.

967
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:06,293
Did I thank him?

968
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:23,810
Who's there?

969
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:27,022
Mr. Yoon.

970
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:28,774
Where were you?

971
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:31,276
I went to brush my teeth.

972
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:34,571
I thought you weren't here.

973
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,281
Is something wrong?

974
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:41,828
I just realized
I didn't thank you properly earlier.

975
00:59:43,914 --> 00:59:45,248
Thank you.

976
00:59:45,874 --> 00:59:46,833
Okay.

977
00:59:48,168 --> 00:59:50,712
Did you come back to the office
just to say that?

978
00:59:50,796 --> 00:59:51,880
Yes.

979
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:53,173
I thought you might be working

980
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:54,925
on the construction company's
asset freeze.

981
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:58,386
I was just wrapping up to go home.

982
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:00,430
I see.

983
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:02,265
See you tomorrow.

984
01:00:02,349 --> 01:00:03,225
Okay.

985
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:06,436
Mr. Yoon.

986
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:12,150
Would you like to have some beer?

987
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:17,405
This is so nice!

988
01:00:19,658 --> 01:00:22,494
It's a shame
that we can't come up here often

989
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:23,703
because of work.

990
01:00:28,542 --> 01:00:30,961
I really liked what you said.

991
01:00:32,129 --> 01:00:36,591
That justice is protecting
the people you have to protect.

992
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:42,013
You told me last time

993
01:00:42,097 --> 01:00:47,602
that you realized how powerful
words can be as a weapon.

994
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:52,899
So I realized
that you use that weapon carefully

995
01:00:53,525 --> 01:00:55,193
to defend your clients

996
01:00:56,319 --> 01:01:00,824
and to protect the people
you have to protect.

997
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:04,953
I used to think the same way.

998
01:01:07,164 --> 01:01:09,457
Both my parents are in the legal field,

999
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,626
so I naturally thought

1000
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:14,004
I'd choose to become a lawyer.

1001
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:16,590
But as a kid,

1002
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:20,177
I saw my mom slicing her opponent
in court with such sharp words,

1003
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:23,096
and I started to think
that maybe that path wasn't for me.

1004
01:01:23,722 --> 01:01:25,056
Then in high school,

1005
01:01:26,141 --> 01:01:28,894
my friend's dad got injured at work,

1006
01:01:28,977 --> 01:01:32,105
but the boss was so cruel
that he didn't even give him

1007
01:01:32,189 --> 01:01:33,940
any compensation or severance.

1008
01:01:35,025 --> 01:01:37,027
So I turned to my mom for help.

1009
01:01:38,612 --> 01:01:40,238
I wore my mom's clothes

1010
01:01:40,322 --> 01:01:42,240
and even copied the way she spoke.

1011
01:01:42,324 --> 01:01:43,783
As I talked to the boss,

1012
01:01:46,077 --> 01:01:47,329
I could see him flinch.

1013
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:49,998
Even though I was only a high school kid.

1014
01:01:50,999 --> 01:01:52,334
That's when I realized

1015
01:01:53,043 --> 01:01:55,545
the sharpness of words isn't the problem.

1016
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:59,174
What matters is where you use them

1017
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:02,219
and who you use them for.

1018
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:05,931
I realized that using words
to protect those I have to protect

1019
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,725
could be a fun profession.

1020
01:02:09,517 --> 01:02:11,686
It felt like I was meant to do this.

1021
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:16,483
You're meant to do this.

1022
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:18,318
You're clearly cut out for the job.

1023
01:02:18,902 --> 01:02:19,986
I'm relieved to hear that.

1024
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:24,407
I felt like…

1025
01:02:27,118 --> 01:02:29,996
I was walking through a dark tunnel alone,

1026
01:02:31,665 --> 01:02:33,541
but you lent me a flashlight.

1027
01:02:34,376 --> 01:02:35,710
Thank you.

1028
01:03:30,765 --> 01:03:33,852
BEYOND THE BAR

1029
01:03:33,935 --> 01:03:34,853
A murder charge.

1030
01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:36,938
Are they claiming
you intentionally killed him?

1031
01:03:37,022 --> 01:03:38,481
I'm not suggesting we kill him.

1032
01:03:38,565 --> 01:03:40,400
If he's dying anyway,
why not just let him?

1033
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:43,862
May I ask what you plan to indict her for?

1034
01:03:43,945 --> 01:03:44,863
Murder.

1035
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:48,325
What if Dr. Choi was aware
of Kim Byeong-su's preexisting condition?

1036
01:03:48,408 --> 01:03:49,617
-I found it.
-What?

1037
01:03:49,701 --> 01:03:50,660
Have you eaten anything?

1038
01:03:50,744 --> 01:03:53,204
You must be that scary Boss Man.

1039
01:03:53,288 --> 01:03:54,372
I was never scary.

1040
01:03:54,456 --> 01:03:57,000
I'm going to make Yullim
a place of justice.

1041
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:59,377
Find me Mr. Lee's weak spot.

1042
01:03:59,461 --> 01:04:01,880
It appears we'll need
to fast-track the plan.

1043
01:04:04,049 --> 01:04:06,051
