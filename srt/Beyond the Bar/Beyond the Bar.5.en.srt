1
00:00:31,537 --> 00:00:35,953
BEYOND THE BAR

2
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,123
This is where I keep all my treasures.

3
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:44,211
- I wish I could live here for a day.
- This is amazing.

4
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:45,879
Wait, hold on.

5
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,675
Isn't this Seo Won-mi's <i>Meet the Body?</i>

6
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:51,468
As expected, you know your stuff.

7
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:58,058
But what about these covered up pieces?

8
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:02,521
I'm extra careful when it comes
to preserving my most cherished pieces.

9
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:04,731
Careful…

10
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:08,443
Have you heard
of the up-and-coming breakout artist

11
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:09,903
named Ryu Gwan‑mo?

12
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:12,155
I know him. I saw him on the news.

13
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,740
He's really famous.

14
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:15,951
He graduated from
a prestigious art school in the US

15
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:17,536
and even exhibited at the Marte Museum.

16
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:21,081
The Marte Museum is a fixture in Chelsea.

17
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:23,417
They only invite
really famous artists to exhibit there.

18
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,295
It took a lot of effort
to acquire one of his pieces.

19
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,338
For how much?

20
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:31,300
For 300 million won?

21
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:32,509
- Three hundred?
- Unreal.

22
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:35,178
What does a 300-million-won painting
even look like?

23
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:36,972
Now, it's time

24
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:41,018
to reveal Ryu Gwan‑mo's <i>Fiesta.</i>

25
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:52,571
You're kidding, right?

26
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,073
- What do you mean?
- How much was that?

27
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,034
Three hundred million?

28
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,037
Have you lost your mind?

29
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:02,164
What's wrong with you?

30
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,206
Listen,

31
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:05,292
I have that painting at home.

32
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:09,046
- What?
- I also have the same one at home.

33
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,967
Ye-jin, you really need
to stop lying like that.

34
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:14,926
I'm lying?

35
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:25,270
- Hey, Mom.
<i>- Hey, Ye-jin.</i>

36
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:27,648
- Are you home?
<i>- Yes.</i>

37
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,567
Can you show us the painting
in the master bedroom?

38
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,402
<i>Sure. Hold on.</i>

39
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,122
Thanks, Mom. Bye.

40
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,126
I wonder who's actually lying here.

41
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,212
You paid 300 million won for that?

42
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,255
That's hilarious.

43
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:54,841
I got that painting a while ago
from a flea market

44
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:56,051
for 100,000 won.

45
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:01,515
What? 100,000 won?

46
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:03,558
You got a knockoff.

47
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,061
A copy of this work.

48
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,979
That makes more sense.

49
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:11,608
I guess someone was selling
replicas of <i>Fiesta </i>at the flea market.

50
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:14,194
Isn't this the date
when the painting was finished?

51
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:18,240
September 2024. That's six months ago.

52
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:19,991
So?

53
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:22,119
I bought that painting a year ago.

54
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:25,455
What?

55
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:30,502
Yours is the knockoff.

56
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:33,922
Seo-yeong, you haven't changed one bit.

57
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:37,634
Do you remember when I called out
your knockoff shoes in middle school?

58
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,469
You insisted they were real,

59
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:43,348
but when we asked the store,
they confirmed the shoes were fake.

60
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:44,766
That was so funny.

61
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,979
You still haven't fixed that bad habit?

62
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,606
I mean, I heard you made a bit of money

63
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,568
from reselling clothes
with swapped out labels,

64
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,361
so I assumed you stopped all that.

65
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:58,530
But I guess

66
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,283
leopards can't change their spots.

67
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:04,494
Swapped out… labels?

68
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,122
Watch it.

69
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:10,000
Don't run your mouth
when you don't know anything.

70
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,003
And what will you do
if it turns out yours is the knockoff?

71
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:16,381
That is highly unlikely,
but on the off chance it is,

72
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:19,509
I will tattoo

73
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:22,387
"I am a knockoff" on the back of my neck.

74
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,975
But if yours is the knockoff,
you'll get a tattoo that says

75
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:29,603
"Knockoff addict."

76
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:33,273
- What?
- What's wrong?

77
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:34,941
Scared?

78
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,486
No.

79
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,488
Not one bit.

80
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:42,199
All right. You're on.

81
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:44,701
Did you hear that?

82
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:45,952
- Yeah.
- Yes.

83
00:04:55,837 --> 00:05:00,759
SALIERI'S MONOLOGUE

84
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:05,347
I'm pregnant.

85
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:07,849
I'm six months along.

86
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,231
Sorry if I startled you.

87
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:16,900
The timing was never right.

88
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,611
How…

89
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:23,240
How could you?

90
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,909
How could I have a baby
with Won-jun when I told you

91
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,537
I didn't want one with you?

92
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:31,915
I had a change of heart.

93
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,419
How can you just say something like that…

94
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,047
so easily?

95
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,007
Because it's the truth.

96
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:43,051
Once I got to my late thirties,

97
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:47,806
my view on having children changed.

98
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,434
Don't make this about you.
This has nothing to do with you.

99
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:52,811
Nothing to do with me?

100
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,021
In my twenties and early thirties,

101
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,482
I just wanted to focus on myself.

102
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:04,322
I think you could've been
a good father too.

103
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:09,202
If you had stayed by my side,

104
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,830
this could've been your baby.

105
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,673
I still feel sorry about that.

106
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:25,093
I decided on my own

107
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,388
to take away your chance to be a father.

108
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,600
Oh, and your cologne.

109
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,102
I guess the baby doesn't like it.

110
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,230
My morning sickness has been bad.

111
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,066
I made you six months' worth
and sent it all at once.

112
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,194
I'll make you more after I have the baby.

113
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,755
So, to summarize,

114
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:04,591
Ms. Lee Seo-yeong purchased
your piece <i>Fiesta</i>

115
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,927
for 300 million won,

116
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,554
but Ms. Hwang Ye-jin
claims she purchased the same piece

117
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:13,016
for 100,000 won
before <i>Fiesta</i> was completed.

118
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,645
So now, Ms. Lee Seo-yeong has filed

119
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:19,606
a lawsuit against you
for fraud and copyright infringement,

120
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,733
but she has agreed to drop all the suits

121
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:25,320
if the court rules that the piece
she bought is the original

122
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,989
and Ms. Hwang Ye-jin's piece
is a counterfeit.

123
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:29,616
Yes. Never in my life have I…

124
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:33,119
experienced…

125
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,665
an insult like this.

126
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:39,960
As if copying it wasn't enough,

127
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:43,296
how could they sell it at a flea market
and not even at a gallery?

128
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,299
And for a measly 100,000 won, no less.

129
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:50,762
And that thieving brat

130
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,931
who has humiliated me like this…

131
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,642
I will bury them.

132
00:07:56,977 --> 00:08:01,189
Please pursue every action
available under the law.

133
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,191
Yes, sir.

134
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:05,986
Oh God.

135
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:16,162
I think this is the main building.

136
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,206
It's not the annex?

137
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:21,126
It's just been constant indigestion.
I feel a bit nauseous.

138
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,878
You should get that checked out.
Death spares no one.

139
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:25,005
Oh, please.

140
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:27,799
- We need to go to the annex.
- Yes.

141
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,801
- I just need digestive medicine.
- Hold on.

142
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:31,511
Excuse me.

143
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,639
This is the annex building.

144
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,016
Where are you going?

145
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,853
Administration.

146
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:45,066
Just take a left at this corner
and you'll find it.

147
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:48,903
- She knows sign language.
- You're pretty good at it.

148
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,321
Thank you.

149
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,871
When did you learn sign language?

150
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,122
Do you go to church?

151
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:00,623
What?

152
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:03,126
A lot of people learn
sign language at church.

153
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:05,086
No, I don't.

154
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:07,839
It's a bit of a long story.

155
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:10,050
What do you mean? Where did you learn it?

156
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:15,138
Jeez, you scared me.

157
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:17,891
What?

158
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,353
INTRO TO KOREAN SIGN LANGUAGE

159
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:27,942
So, you want me to read this book
and teach you sign language?

160
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:29,986
- Yes.
- Why would I do that?

161
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:33,073
I can't read because of my dyslexia.

162
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,616
- So?
- That's why

163
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:37,786
I'm asking you to read it
and then teach me.

164
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:40,371
I'm a senior.

165
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:41,539
I am too.

166
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:42,874
For the third time.

167
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:45,043
I mean, why are you suddenly trying…

168
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:47,212
to learn sign language?

169
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,214
She wants to meet her twin sister.

170
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,174
She wants to be able to talk with her.

171
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,927
I've always wanted to see her again.

172
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:56,429
I feel like when I do,

173
00:09:57,806 --> 00:09:59,474
this spell will be broken.

174
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:02,602
My dyslexia, I mean.

175
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:19,452
Hyo-ju, it's really nice to see you.
We finally get to meet. I missed you.

176
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,833
Do you remember me?

177
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:32,590
Are you sure that was right?

178
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:35,718
Yeah, of course.

179
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,762
It doesn't seem like she understands.

180
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:40,890
Maybe you learned English sign language

181
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,226
and not Korean Sign Language.

182
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:46,771
You can just talk.

183
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,732
I can read lips too.

184
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:58,366
Oh, is that what happened?

185
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,869
Yeah, that's when I learned

186
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:04,747
that not all deaf people
rely exclusively on sign language.

187
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,585
Hyo-min's sister knew
both sign language and lipreading.

188
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,044
What is lipreading?

189
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,340
It's watching someone's mouth movements
to understand what they're saying.

190
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:19,179
I see. Lipreading…

191
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:27,979
PLAINTIFF'S CLAIM SUMMARY

COMPLAINT
PLAINTIFF: RYU GWAN-MO

00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:46,122
DEFENDANT: MOON JEONG-HYE

195
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,921
<i>Hyo-ju, what is this?</i>

196
00:11:56,341 --> 00:12:00,053
<i>A friend of mine received this complaint,</i>
<i>and it seemed serious.</i>

197
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,388
<i>I was wondering</i>
<i>if my talented lawyer sister</i>

198
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,098
<i>could take a look at it for her.</i>

199
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:07,101
<i>Okay.</i>

200
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:08,937
<i>I'll text you after I take a look.</i>

201
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,150
CLAIM FOR DAMAGES

202
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:15,109
PLAINTIFF: RYU GWAN-MO

203
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:21,866
COUNSEL FOR PLAINTIFF: LEE & SEO
HAN SEONG-CHAN, MIN SO-RA

204
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:32,252
<i>The plaintiff is Ryu Gwan-mo.</i>
<i>Isn't he a famous artist?</i>

205
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,796
<i>And the firm representing him</i>
<i>is Lee & Seo.</i>

206
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,339
<i>It does look serious.</i>

207
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:40,009
<i>She probably got it a while ago.</i>
<i>Why wait so long to bring it up?</i>

208
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:42,637
<i>Well, she's a bit young</i>

209
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,807
<i>and has never gotten something like this,</i>
<i>so she just let it sit on her desk.</i>

210
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,810
<i>I found it today</i>
<i>and rushed to send it to you.</i>

MOON JEONG-HYE

214
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,367
JUDGMENT DATE

215
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:10,081
<i>The judgment date is at two o'clock today.</i>

216
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,667
<i>What is that?</i>

217
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,920
<i>The complaint was served,</i>
<i>but she failed to respond within 30 days</i>

218
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:19,215
<i>or appear in court,</i>
<i>so the judgment date was set.</i>

219
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:20,675
<i>And that's today.</i>

220
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,012
<i>So? Is that bad?</i>

221
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:28,224
<i>At this rate,</i>
<i>the plaintiff will win by default.</i>

222
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:31,769
<i>Then, the defendant,</i>
<i>your friend Jeong-hye,</i>

223
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:34,772
<i>will only be able to contest the decision</i>
<i>with an appeal.</i>

224
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:38,693
<i>I don't fully understand,</i>
<i>but I'm guessing it doesn't look good?</i>

225
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:41,029
<i>Yes, she needs to go to court immediately</i>

226
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:43,614
<i>and submit a request to cancel</i>
<i>the default judgment hearing.</i>

227
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,785
<i>Can you do that for her?</i>

228
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:50,955
<i>Of course. For your friend, I can.</i>

229
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,916
<i>Thanks, Hyo-min.</i>

230
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,965
COURT

231
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:03,217
Submission of the Power of Attorney form
was confirmed.

232
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:05,762
Let's cancel the judgment hearing for now.

233
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:08,348
Thank you, Your Honor.

234
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:10,767
However, since there is
an ongoing criminal case

235
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,936
related to the dispute involving
the plaintiff, Mr. Ryu Gwan-mo,

236
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,564
I can't give you that much time.

237
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,358
I see.

238
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:22,904
Submit your answer within a week
and adhere to the deadline.

239
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,113
Did you say one week?

240
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,493
Yes, Your Honor.

241
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:30,578
Understood.

242
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:41,589
Come in.

243
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:46,844
- Mr. Lee.
- What's up?

244
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:55,895
What's that?

245
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,314
COMPLAINT
COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT, ETC.

246
00:14:58,940 --> 00:14:59,941
Ms. Kang.

247
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:03,820
You should've consulted a senior attorney
before taking on a new case.

248
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,447
It was very urgent,
and she's my sister's friend--

249
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:09,283
Did you forget already?
About the mess I had to clean up

250
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:11,828
after you ran off to investigate
the city gas case.

251
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,080
But everything worked out in the end…

252
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:16,916
I'm sorry, sir.

253
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,336
And the retainer fee?

254
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,130
I was hoping we could do it pro bono?

255
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:23,381
PRO BONO: FREE LEGAL SERVICE

256
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,341
That requires special authorization.

257
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:27,343
You're driving me nuts.

258
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:29,846
For the sake of argument,
let's say we get approval.

259
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,556
You only have a week to prepare.

260
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:32,807
Ever been in court as counsel?

261
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,976
During the pretrial hearing

262
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,395
for that case
about the no-contact car accident, I--

263
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:40,940
That was you just outlining
the trial plan in front of a judge.

264
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,401
You've never argued a case in court.

265
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:46,612
Correct. I have no experience.

266
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:48,072
You must be so proud.

267
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,033
Hold on. Damn it…

268
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:55,329
Mr. Hong would be mentoring
if it's a pro bono case.

269
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:56,456
What?

270
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,124
After your squabble last time,

271
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,668
he'll be itching
to get back at you. Damn it.

272
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:05,006
Let's first discuss this with Mr. Yoon.

273
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,340
- Come on.
- Okay.

274
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:13,848
So, when is the court date?

275
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,141
Next Wednesday.

276
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:18,936
There's only a week to prepare,
so I'm seriously worried.

277
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,106
You've been a troublemaker since day one.

278
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,984
- My apologies.
- There you go again.

279
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,821
How do you plan to argue this?
Are you confident?

280
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,741
No, I am not.

281
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,035
Who's the counsel for the plaintiff?

282
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,077
It's Lee & Seo.

283
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:36,162
Lee & Seo?

284
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:39,207
The plaintiff is Ryu Gwan-mo,
an internationally acclaimed artist.

285
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,750
It makes sense.

286
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:46,255
- Is a former official involved?
- No. A partner and some associates…

287
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,466
Three of them…

288
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:52,803
There's not much I can do for you now.

289
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:54,514
I'll handle the admin side,

290
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:57,600
but you'll prepare the defense
on your own and own the outcome.

291
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:58,809
You may leave.

292
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:01,437
Yes, sir.

293
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,369
Should I try holding a training session
on making legal arguments?

294
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,579
Mr. Hong is in charge of pro bono cases.

295
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:21,457
He'll be sitting next to her in court.

296
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,501
One wrong move by Ms. Kang,

297
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,671
and he'll use it
as an excuse to toss her out.

298
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,839
Just thinking about it
gives me a headache.

299
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,384
She is unbelievable.

300
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:37,473
Should I have her
practice legal arguments?

301
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:39,850
Yes, do that.

302
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:42,103
Yes, sir. I'll get started right away.

303
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:45,356
Unbelievable.

304
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:49,819
WELL DONE!
KANG HYO-MIN

305
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,488
I'm sure it's been a while
since you've seen a sticker reward chart.

306
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:56,742
The first person
to fill their sticker chart

307
00:17:56,826 --> 00:18:00,162
will earn bonus points
in the practical training evaluation.

308
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:01,831
Today's training session will be

309
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,541
about making legal arguments.

310
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,751
Since you'll all be arguing in court soon,

311
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:07,920
I'm sure this will be very beneficial.

312
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:09,088
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

313
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:11,966
Today's session will be carried out
in a tournament format.

314
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,884
Today's winner will receive…

315
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:14,885
Ta-da!

316
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,054
Three stickers.

317
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:19,140
- Amazing…
- You don't sound very convincing.

318
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:20,474
Awesome!

319
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:21,851
Hello, sir.

320
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:23,686
Hello.

321
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,605
I was explaining the tournament to them.

322
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:27,064
I see. Please continue.

323
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:28,357
Yes, sir.

324
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:31,861
Now, I shall reveal
today's tournament bracket.

325
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:33,362
Please get started.

326
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:36,824
Mr. Oh Sang-cheol and Ms. Choi Ho-yeon,
please step forward.

327
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:39,619
The defendant, as the CEO
of the plaintiff's company,

328
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:43,456
recklessly took part in acquiring
new shares of an affiliate

329
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:46,208
despite the company's
dire financial situation,

330
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,210
causing financial damage to the company.

331
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:52,256
The defendant took part in the acquisition
for the benefit of both the company

332
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,716
and everyone involved.

333
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,844
The defendant's conduct was
within the scope of managerial judgment

334
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:59,305
and thus does not constitute
grounds for liability.

335
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:02,308
Even if the plaintiff's company
ultimately suffered a loss,

336
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:06,312
the defendant convened the board
and consulted with experts

337
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:09,732
to make a rational decision
in light of the prevailing circumstances.

338
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,449
And the winner is…

339
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:20,701
Oh Sang-cheol.

340
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:23,704
Hey!

341
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:25,164
That's quite the celebration.

342
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,749
Both of you did well,

343
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,293
but Mr. Oh's diction was more punchy,

344
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:31,962
and his relaxed body language
left a stronger impression.

345
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:35,841
The next match will be
Ji Guk-hyeon against Kang Hyo-min.

346
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:38,177
If there is a defect
in an administrative disposition,

347
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,137
the issuing authority
may revoke it independently

348
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:42,098
without additional legal authority.

349
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:45,559
The administrative measure in this case
constitutes a beneficial disposition.

350
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:48,104
Its revocation should require
a weighing of public interest

351
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:51,232
against the disadvantages to the party,
such as infringement of vested rights,

352
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:55,903
protection of legitimate expectations,
and the stability of legal relations.

353
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:04,495
Well, both of you exceeded expectations,

354
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:07,665
but Mr. Ji, your speech began
to speed up in the middle,

355
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:10,209
which in turn
hurt the effectiveness of your delivery.

356
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,877
Thus, the winner of this match is…

357
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,547
Kang Hyo-min!

358
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,798
Congratulations.

359
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:18,551
The loser should sit.

360
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,889
Now, we'll have a match

361
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:27,685
between the winners,
Mr. Oh Sang-cheol and Ms. Kang Hyo-min.

362
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:30,688
This time, both of you
will be given the same brief.

363
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:33,441
This brief was personally written
by Mr. Yoon

364
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:36,193
and will be used as the basis
of your arguments.

365
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:38,028
- Here are the briefs.
- Thank you.

366
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:39,280
Here.

367
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,247
Article 9, Paragraph 2
of the contract in this case stipulates

368
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:51,292
that the agreement may be terminated
if the delay damages reach

369
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,043
twice the amount of the deposit.

370
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:57,381
Therefore, until the delay damages reach
twice the amount of the deposit,

371
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:59,592
the contract cannot be terminated.

372
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:09,894
The defendant asserts the delay

373
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:12,104
is not attributable to them.

374
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:15,065
However, the existence of a delay

375
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:18,068
proves the defendant's negligence.

376
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:26,410
Let's skip the feedback.
Today's champion is…

377
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:28,329
Oh Sang-cheol!

378
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:31,707
Congratulations.

379
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,168
Mr. Oh is the winner.

380
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:37,588
Well done, everybody.

381
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:40,716
- Thank you, sir.
- See you later.

382
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,552
Let's wrap it up.

383
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:45,805
I guess your head was a little jumbled up.

384
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,767
The champion, Oh Sang-cheol,
will get three stickers.

385
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,186
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

386
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,729
Let's clean things up here.

387
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,022
- Okay.
- Good job today.

388
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,482
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

389
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:58,901
Mr. Oh, I didn't see that coming.

390
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,111
That's right. I've always been this good.

391
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:02,780
Seriously.

392
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:10,454
A first-year at Yullim is
the sole counsel for the defendant?

393
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:12,248
- Yes, sir.
- What in the world?

394
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,500
The defendant can't afford it anyway.

395
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,336
I'm sure Yullim is treating it
as a training session for a first-year

396
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,129
and just tossing them a bone.

397
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:20,089
Really?

398
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,300
Then we should give them proper training.

399
00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:25,094
You'll oversee this case.

400
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,178
Me?

401
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,014
Should I go against the first-year, then?

402
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:30,683
Yes. Right.

403
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,184
Crush them.

404
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:33,894
Understood.

405
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:36,272
- You may leave.
- Yes, sir.

406
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,192
Wait…

407
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,528
Who is this Yullim first-year?

408
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,029
It's Kang Hyo-min.

409
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:45,781
- Kang Hyo-min?
- Yes.

410
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:48,158
Prepare thoroughly.

411
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,786
It's a sure win
provided you don't slip up.

412
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,122
No, you should still win, even if you do.

413
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,707
Win, no matter what.

414
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,708
Yes, sir.

415
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:04,800
MIN SO-RA

416
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:06,719
FOR COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT
TO BE ESTABLISHED…

417
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:11,015
DERIVATION ON THE ORIGINAL WORK
ISN'T RECOGNIZED…

418
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:12,308
SIMILARITY IS A SEPARATE ISSUE…

419
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:15,811
FIESTA, EXPRESSING EMOTIONS
THROUGH COLOR

420
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:31,535
A key factor is that the infringing work…

421
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:34,455
However, no evidence
supporting that was submitted.

422
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,332
However, copyright infringement
is determined…

423
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:40,294
It is up to the plaintiff
to prove derivation, and the defendant…

424
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:44,632
In practice, it is very challenging
to establish proof of attendance.

425
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:47,134
One must provide evidence of participation
and related facts.

426
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:49,929
Providing evidence of access
to the plaintiff's work…

427
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:02,149
Oh, no!

428
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:13,786
It was created without a copyright.

429
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:16,121
The plaintiff…

430
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:20,709
Wake up.

431
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:23,128
Wake up, Kang Hyo-min.

432
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:25,047
You're up against Lee & Seo.

433
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,548
Han Seong-chan's team.

434
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:29,593
Hyo-min, you cannot fail in front of him.

435
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:31,929
You cannot. Pull yourself together.

436
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:32,888
Come on, Hyo-min.

437
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,265
Damn it…

438
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:37,226
I don't feel like making more coffee.

439
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,897
But I have this!

440
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,992
So tasty. I'm fully awake now.

441
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:55,869
Let's see.

442
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:07,673
Mr. Yoon!

443
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,429
Jeez, you scared me.
You haven't gone home yet?

444
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:14,513
No.

445
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,056
Sir.

446
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,267
Please help me.

447
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:27,234
FAILURE TO ESTABLISH POSSIBILITY
OF ACCESS TO THE PLAINTIFF'S WORK

448
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:32,990
It's good.

449
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,367
The argument reads smoothly.

450
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:41,373
The issue is how to present
this effectively in court…

451
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:45,044
You have a well-written brief.
What's the issue?

452
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:50,758
I'm not confident I can do well…

453
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:55,512
Then try doing it here.

454
00:25:57,056 --> 00:26:00,017
- Pardon?
- Try it now. I'll watch.

455
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:02,227
Well…

456
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,314
- Isn't the trial tomorrow?
- Yes.

457
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:08,817
If you can't do it in front of me,
how will you do it in court?

458
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:09,860
Go on.

459
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:16,158
It is asserted
that the defendant had access

460
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:19,161
to the plaintiff's work
through the media coverage of it,

461
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:22,122
but there is insufficient evidence.

462
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:25,167
It's true the article included
a small image of the plaintiff's work,

463
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,002
but an image of that size wouldn't be

464
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:30,297
sufficient to recognize
the finer nuances and techniques.

465
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:34,468
Both works were executed using
techniques rarely seen in painting,

466
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:37,888
and such details would not be discernible

467
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:39,723
through the article image alone.

468
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:42,768
In fact, the use of the same technique
in the defendant's work

469
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:46,271
constitutes circumstantial evidence
that suggests the plaintiff

470
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:48,315
may have imitated the defendant's work.

471
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,026
No.

472
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:54,446
Have you tried recording
and listening to your own voice?

473
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:57,908
No.

474
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,160
Honestly,

475
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:03,080
you sound like a bad liar
trying to fake it.

476
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:07,501
In the tournament,

477
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:10,212
do you know why you lost to Mr. Oh?

478
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:14,591
What did you think about that brief?

479
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,721
It's okay. You can tell me.

480
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,559
There were several logical fallacies.

481
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:24,977
Such as?

482
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:28,730
The fallacy of denying the antecedent,
the undistributed middle, and…

483
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:30,983
Circular reasoning was also present.

484
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,109
Yes.

485
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:35,154
I believe the fallacy of denying
the antecedent appeared multiple times.

486
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:36,280
That is correct.

487
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:39,575
It confuses the necessary
and sufficient conditions.

488
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,618
Although it may sound logical at first,

489
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:42,953
it was an error.

490
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:47,833
And you, Ms. Kang,
figured that out immediately,

491
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,501
<i>but Mr. Oh did not.</i>

492
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:50,919
<i>When Mr. Oh</i>

493
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:52,921
<i>heard that I had written it,</i>

494
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:55,799
<i>he assumed that the brief</i>
<i>was perfectly written.</i>

495
00:27:55,883 --> 00:27:56,800
<i>Thus,</i>

496
00:27:56,884 --> 00:27:59,094
he was able to make
his argument with confidence.

497
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:02,890
Mr. Oh's confidence made
that argument riddled with fallacies

498
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:05,809
sound pretty rational and logical.

499
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:07,728
<i>However,</i>

500
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:10,856
<i>when you had to make an argument</i>
<i>that you could not accept,</i>

501
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:15,569
<i>you sounded like a bad liar</i>
<i>trying to fake it,</i>

502
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,446
<i>so it wasn't convincing at all.</i>

503
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:21,742
That's still the case.

504
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:26,455
You already believe your client
copied that painting.

505
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:30,334
Ryu Gwan-mo graduated
from a prestigious university in the US

506
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:33,503
and is a promising artist
with international recognition.

507
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:34,796
While your client

508
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:37,633
is just a mere amateur.

509
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,180
Let go of your biases

510
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,682
and look at the essence.

511
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:52,648
COURT

512
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:56,235
TODAY'S COURT SCHEDULE
PLAINTIFF RYU, DEFENDANT MOON, IN SESSION

513
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:15,462
FIRST HEARING FOR DAMAGES
OVER FIESTA COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT

514
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,632
All rise.

515
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:31,228
You may be seated.

516
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:35,232
RYU GWAN-MO, MOON JEONG-HYE

517
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:38,485
Even in the eyes of the court,
there is no dispute

518
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:41,196
that substantial similarities exist

519
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,907
between the plaintiff's <i>Fiesta</i>

520
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:45,575
and the defendant's <i>Amusement Park.</i>

521
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:47,202
The only issue in dispute is derivation.

522
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:49,413
DERIVATION:
WHETHER ONE WAS CREATED BASED ON THE OTHER

523
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:52,291
The plaintiff's <i>Fiesta</i>
was announced in October 2024

524
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:53,875
and shown in November of that year,

525
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:56,169
which was covered by many media outlets.

526
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:59,881
Thus, it would be reasonable to infer
that the defendant saw <i>Fiesta </i>in person

527
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:01,967
and through various outlets
during its exhibition

528
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,386
before using it to produce <i>Amusement Park.</i>

529
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:07,055
If the defendant's <i>Amusement Park</i>

530
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:09,641
was actually produced
before the plaintiff's <i>Fiesta,</i>

531
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:12,644
that would constitute the plaintiff's
imitation of the defendant's work.

532
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:15,230
<i>Amusement Park</i> was completed
in March 2024,

533
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:17,190
before <i>Fiesta </i>was announced.

534
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:19,776
The defendant's argument
is purely arbitrary.

535
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:22,446
The defendant has not submitted
any objective evidence

536
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,448
that proves when<i> Amusement Park</i>
was completed.

537
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:25,907
That is not true.

538
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:27,826
The defendant
made a sale of <i>Amusement Park</i>

539
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:30,454
at a flea market
prior to the announcement of <i>Fiesta.</i>

540
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:33,790
The person claiming to have purchased
the defendant's work is Ms. Hwang Ye-jin,

541
00:30:33,874 --> 00:30:36,501
but her testimony lacks credibility.

542
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:38,420
The brief outlines
the reasoning in detail.

543
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:39,880
Yes.

544
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:43,592
The credibility concern raised
regarding Ms. Hwang's testimony,

545
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:46,261
based on her relationship
with Ms. Lee Seo-yeong, is acknowledged.

546
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:49,014
The court also acknowledges
the testimonies of their acquaintances

547
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,349
that support this concern.

548
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:55,687
Does the defense counsel
have any other objective evidence,

549
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:58,565
aside from Ms. Hwang Ye-jin's testimony
that she purchased <i>Amusement Park</i>

550
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:00,484
at a flea market in April 2024?

551
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:01,693
We do.

552
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:04,154
To provide such evidence,
we ask the court to allow

553
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:06,740
party examination of the plaintiff
and the defendant

554
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:08,116
as outlined in the brief.

555
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,832
FIESTA BY RYU GWAN-MO
AMUSEMENT PARK BY MOON JEONG-HYE

556
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:17,417
It appears that in <i>Fiesta,</i>

557
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:19,878
you utilized a new style not seen
in your previous works.

558
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:23,215
Can you tell us what led you
to experiment with this new approach?

559
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:27,594
When I was at SAIC…
You know what that is, right?

560
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:30,138
SAIC.
School of the Art Institute of Chicago.

561
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:34,684
You must know…

562
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:38,647
It is a world-renowned art school

563
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,941
that has produced
waves of artistic geniuses…

564
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:44,820
A specialty school.
Isn't that common knowledge?

565
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:48,281
Perhaps not,
if you're unfamiliar with art.

566
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:51,535
That must be why
you represent someone like that.

567
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:56,373
Cut him off. Don't just let him babble on.

568
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:59,626
The witness should limit
his answers to counsel's questions.

569
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,503
Let me ask again.

570
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:05,215
Can you tell us what led you
to experiment with this new approach?

571
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,509
An artist's personal experiences

572
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:13,473
and emotional shifts
have a profound impact

573
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:16,852
on their work.

574
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:19,646
A short while before I produced <i>Fiesta,</i>

575
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:22,983
my child was born.

576
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,445
When I held my child

577
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:29,573
in my arms for the very first time,

578
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:32,617
I felt happiness, joy,

579
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:36,455
and new emotions about humankind.

580
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:38,498
All of that had
a profound effect on my work.

581
00:32:38,582 --> 00:32:40,542
In my previous work,
the beauty of empty space

582
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:44,004
and the harmony of black
and white were pronounced.

583
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:45,297
With my piece,<i> Fiesta…</i>

584
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:50,510
With "my piece," <i>Fiesta,</i>
I utilized a drip technique

585
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:53,597
and a unique <i>matière</i> technique
I personally developed

586
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,433
to produce a work

587
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:59,644
with playful allure, rooted in vivid hues.

588
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:01,354
<i>La fiesta.</i>

589
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,568
It means "party" in Spanish.

590
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:13,283
That's what it is. A party.

591
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:16,203
The birth of a baby.

592
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:21,666
Can you explain the drip
and <i>matière</i> techniques?

593
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:24,085
The drip technique

594
00:33:25,045 --> 00:33:28,465
involves pouring paint
directly onto the canvas.

595
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:32,385
The <i>matière</i> technique
is quite a unique method that is used

596
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:34,221
to create visual texture.

597
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:36,515
- I see--
- In my piece, <i>Fiesta,</i>

598
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:40,101
I made subtle adjustments to both
the water ratio and paint amount

599
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:45,023
to ensure perfectly predictable,
precise dripping that became the base

600
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:46,399
for a striking visual effect--

601
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:47,817
Yes, thank you.

602
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,320
That's how I made it.

603
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:53,031
Yes.

604
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:58,370
It's clear Ryu Gwan-mo is
the originator of this new technique.

605
00:34:05,794 --> 00:34:07,963
As an artist, the work you produced…

606
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:11,091
I mean, come on.

607
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:15,262
They'll call just about anyone
an artist these days.

608
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:17,055
Please calm down, sir.

609
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:18,431
My goodness.

610
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,643
As an artist, all the art you produced--

611
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:22,811
Jeez. What? "Art"?

612
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,647
Plaintiff, compose yourself.

613
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:29,401
The defense counsel may continue.

614
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:35,824
As an artist, all the art you produced
shares a common style.

615
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:39,035
Can you explain how you came about
adopting your techniques?

616
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,956
Yes, well, I…

617
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:43,999
I…

618
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:53,967
So…

619
00:34:57,721 --> 00:34:59,055
I just drew it.

620
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:05,770
When you were younger, you went
to an amusement park with your dad

621
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:07,939
- and saw a colorful parade--
- Your Honor.

622
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:10,650
Objection. Leading the witness.

623
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:12,527
Counsel,

624
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:17,866
leading questions are prohibited
when examining your own witness.

625
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:21,244
Are you unaware
of such basic procedural rules?

626
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:36,384
You just need to tell us
the intention behind your painting.

627
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:39,179
I don't know.

628
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:46,478
What's wrong with her?

629
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:50,357
Ms. Moon.

630
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,567
All your paintings utilize vivid colors.

631
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:54,778
Can you tell us how you came to use

632
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:56,946
a wider range of colors
than what meets the eye?

633
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,491
I… don't know.

634
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,951
Can I go home now?

635
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,829
What's the point in asking?

636
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:07,861
What would a copycat know anyway?

637
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:09,250
Are you all right?

638
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,710
It's not that…

639
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:23,473
Please forgive me.

640
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:26,810
Forgive… She's asking for forgiveness?

641
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:29,187
- You say that…
- Did she just confess?

642
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,189
…after you tarnish my name?

643
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:35,276
The law should prohibit people like that

644
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,071
from ever picking up
another paintbrush again!

645
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:40,824
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

646
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:42,659
Mom…

647
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:44,953
Jeong-hye.

648
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:47,580
Mom…

649
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:49,082
It's okay.

650
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:54,170
What are you doing?

651
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:57,215
This is a complete crap show. Damn it.

652
00:36:58,842 --> 00:37:01,803
You really are something else.

653
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:05,724
I think it's done.

654
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:08,893
- Well…
- Let's have order in the court.

655
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,688
Silence.

656
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:14,899
Due to the challenges in proceeding
with the witness examination,

657
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:16,609
we will take a ten-minute recess.

658
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:27,746
Pardon?

659
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:29,748
An intellectual disability?

660
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:32,375
Yes.

661
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:38,256
Physically, she's 21 years old,

662
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:41,968
but she has the cognitive level
of a 13-year-old.

663
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:46,806
But it's not to the point
where she can't function in daily life.

664
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:48,308
She can do everything…

665
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:52,604
Gosh…

666
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:56,691
I…

667
00:37:58,151 --> 00:38:01,237
didn't want her to live her life
as a disabled person,

668
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:02,947
so I never registered her.

669
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:09,078
Can't we just stop here?

670
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:12,248
If we stop here, you'll lose the case.

671
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:15,710
Then the monetary damages…

672
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:20,173
I'm not sure she can handle it.

673
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:28,515
And I don't want

674
00:38:28,598 --> 00:38:32,602
people to know
that my Jeong-hye is disabled.

675
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:35,063
That's why I was at the consultation.

676
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,898
And you didn't mention her disability.

677
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:44,072
I didn't think it would make a difference.

678
00:38:48,368 --> 00:38:51,162
You idiot.

679
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:55,291
What sort of idiot strategizes
without even knowing that her client

680
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:56,876
has an intellectual disability?

681
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,296
If you ask a top expert
and a child with a disability

682
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:04,801
to explain art techniques,
who do you think would excel?

683
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:05,760
That's enough.

684
00:39:08,638 --> 00:39:10,098
So, what now?

685
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:11,975
Leave.

686
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:14,519
Excuse me.

687
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:17,856
I'm the one in charge of pro bono cases.
You can't tell me to leave.

688
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:20,483
She falls under my jurisdiction
as my associate.

689
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:24,988
Gosh… What a touching moment
between colleagues.

690
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:28,575
No more screw-ups!

691
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:38,251
I'm sorry, sir.

692
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:41,838
Did you really not know?

693
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:43,673
No, I didn't.

694
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:47,719
Her mother attended
the client meeting in her place.

695
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:50,680
The person who introduced us

696
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:53,391
is hearing impaired,

697
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:56,060
so it seems she didn't notice
Jeong-hye's disability.

698
00:39:58,021 --> 00:40:01,316
I mean, it's understandable.

699
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:05,320
There are communication barriers
between deaf and hearing people.

700
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:08,156
Maybe she thought
it was just miscommunication.

701
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:12,327
You also had so little time to prep.

702
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:14,662
What now?

703
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:19,250
I wouldn't have put her
on the stand if I had known.

704
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:21,794
It's over already.

705
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:25,089
When the court reconvenes,

706
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:27,842
cite health issues
to end party examination.

707
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:31,262
Okay.

708
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:32,388
What?

709
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:35,475
Intellectual disability?

710
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,268
Yes.

711
00:40:38,645 --> 00:40:39,646
What an amusing turn.

712
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,356
I know, right?

713
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:44,359
You must

714
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:48,446
make the defendant
take the stand and grill her.

715
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,531
Yes.

716
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,201
Your Honor.

717
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:57,622
The defendant is not feeling well.
Further questioning will be difficult.

718
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:00,917
Your Honor, the defense counsel
requested this party examination.

719
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,545
And the only way to verify the date
the defendant's work was completed

720
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:07,382
is through the defendant's testimony.

721
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:10,426
We can verify it through
the defendant's history of works

722
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:11,386
with a unified style.

723
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:14,806
If we want to confirm that such works
were indeed produced by the defendant

724
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:18,434
and not created recently
after the incident in question,

725
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:20,979
it is crucial to have
the defendant testify.

726
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:25,149
- Yes, but--
- Since the defendant is in attendance,

727
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:28,403
I believe it would be best
to proceed with the examination.

728
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,738
If the court deems her
physically unable to continue,

729
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:33,908
the court will exercise its authority
to suspend the proceedings.

730
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:43,584
Ms. Moon,
have you ever taken an art lesson?

731
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:47,630
Your testimony is being recorded,
so please answer aloud.

732
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,009
- Yes.
- And where did you take it?

733
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:52,844
Jumi Art Academy…

734
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,303
Please speak louder.

735
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:56,681
At Jumi Art Academy.

736
00:41:57,724 --> 00:41:58,975
Your Honor,

737
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:01,102
Jumi Art Academy is
a neighborhood establishment

738
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,311
led by a non-expert.

739
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:03,980
All right.

740
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:08,776
Do you know a Yoo Seong-eun
who also attends the academy?

741
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:11,195
- Yes.
- Please answer clearly.

742
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:12,613
Yes!

743
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,533
According to Ms. Yoo,

744
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:19,287
the academy students
often visited art fairs and exhibitions

745
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:22,623
and also replicated
the works they saw as practice.

746
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:23,833
Is that true?

747
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,334
Yes.

748
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:27,628
MOON JEONG-HYE

749
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:41,476
- Have you seen this piece before?
- Yes.

750
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,935
Have you copied it before?

751
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:43,936
Yes.

752
00:42:46,481 --> 00:42:49,025
This is the defendant's sketchbook,
acquired from her art academy.

753
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:51,652
In it, we discovered
several replicated works

754
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:54,280
of Mr. Ryu Gwan-mo.

755
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:55,323
We offer it as evidence.

756
00:42:58,618 --> 00:42:59,827
Objection, Your Honor.

757
00:43:00,453 --> 00:43:02,789
The fact that the defendant
has replicated works in the past

758
00:43:02,872 --> 00:43:05,666
cannot be used as evidence
to prove she replicated <i>Fiesta.</i>

759
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:08,878
I believe it's relevant to derivation.

760
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:11,422
The plaintiff's counsel may continue.

761
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,677
I believe you have also seen
an exhibit featuring the works

762
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:18,805
of Mr. Ryu sitting over there.
Is that correct?

763
00:43:19,472 --> 00:43:21,349
- Yes.
- Which exhibit was it?

764
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,685
I don't really…

765
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:27,772
We move to admit
Ms. Yoo's testimony into evidence.

766
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:29,398
According to her testimony,

767
00:43:29,482 --> 00:43:31,818
all the academy students,
including the defendant,

768
00:43:31,901 --> 00:43:36,072
visited Mr. Ryu's exhibit
on November 3, 2024,

769
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:39,367
and <i>Fiesta </i>was one of the works
featured in said exhibit.

770
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:43,830
WITNESS STATEMENT

771
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:50,545
Yes, I'll allow it.

772
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:55,424
After seeing <i>Fiesta </i>at the exhibit,

773
00:43:55,508 --> 00:43:59,303
you replicated it and sold it
for 100,000 won at a flea market, correct?

774
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:02,390
That's…

775
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:03,766
That's not what…

776
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:06,310
Copying someone's work is a crime.

777
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:09,897
So is testifying falsely in court.

778
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:13,317
Do something. Don't just stand there.

779
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:18,447
Let me ask you again.

780
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:23,536
After attending Mr. Ryu's exhibit
on November 3rd,

781
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:25,371
where you saw his <i>Fiesta </i>on display,

782
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:28,958
did you or did you not
replicate it for monetary gain?

783
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:33,212
- I want to go home.
- Answer the question.

784
00:44:33,296 --> 00:44:34,630
Yes.

785
00:44:34,714 --> 00:44:35,798
Yes!

786
00:44:38,868 --> 00:44:39,844
No further questions.

787
00:44:41,137 --> 00:44:42,513
Do something!

788
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:12,793
Defense counsel, would you like
to cross-examine the witness?

789
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:19,717
Let go of your biases

790
00:45:20,927 --> 00:45:22,136
and look at the essence.

791
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:25,139
Counsel.

792
00:45:26,182 --> 00:45:28,601
Counsel, are you all right?

793
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:33,439
Your Honor.

794
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:37,235
May I request a short recess?

795
00:45:38,361 --> 00:45:42,198
Of course. At the end of the day,
you're just a newbie.

796
00:45:46,494 --> 00:45:49,247
You were acting
like you're all that. So what now?

797
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:51,832
Do you want me to do damage control?

798
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:54,210
Try saying, "Please help me, sir."
I'll help you.

799
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:56,170
No, I'll handle it.

800
00:45:56,254 --> 00:45:58,130
You're still so full of yourself.

801
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:02,301
We can't just let
the worst-case scenario happen.

802
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:05,012
Just have her admit to copying it.

803
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,057
She is my client.

804
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:09,934
I will take care of it.

805
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:13,479
Look at you, acting up again.

806
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,982
Why are you being such a brat?

807
00:46:18,943 --> 00:46:20,236
What's going on?

808
00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:24,031
It's nothing.
Just be on your way. Damn it…

809
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:33,457
What do you think you're doing? Jeez.

810
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:55,396
- Jeong-hye.
- Yes. I messed up…

811
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,399
I…

812
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:00,860
messed up.

813
00:47:07,408 --> 00:47:10,369
I am your attorney.

814
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:13,622
What that means is,

815
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:19,086
I am completely on your side.

816
00:47:20,296 --> 00:47:21,339
And…

817
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:25,384
whatever you tell me,

818
00:47:26,052 --> 00:47:27,928
I will not tell anyone else.

819
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:36,020
Can you tell me about the painting?

820
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:43,652
Yes.

821
00:48:13,766 --> 00:48:15,601
COURT IN SESSION

822
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:18,396
What is <i>Fiesta </i>about?

823
00:48:18,479 --> 00:48:19,605
Unbelievable.

824
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:30,032
Before my child was born,

825
00:48:30,658 --> 00:48:33,327
I once enjoyed a festival of lights
in Spain with the artist Minato,

826
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:35,121
who was in the late stages
of her pregnancy.

827
00:48:35,204 --> 00:48:37,331
She and I discussed

828
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:40,835
various emotions surrounding childbirth.
I used those emotions as inspiration

829
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:43,504
to create an image of the festival.

830
00:48:44,505 --> 00:48:46,090
It's like a landscape painting.

831
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,342
- So it's a landscape.
- Yes.

832
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:52,680
By any chance, is there a hidden image
inside your work?

833
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:09,447
No. Why do you ask?

834
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:11,115
So, there isn't one?

835
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:14,368
There isn't.

836
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:17,329
No further questions.

837
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:30,551
Ms. Moon.

838
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:35,931
That painting over there.
What is it a painting of?

839
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,449
My dad's face.

840
00:49:54,867 --> 00:49:57,828
I see. Your dad's face.

841
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:00,831
Do you remember your dad's face?

842
00:50:01,624 --> 00:50:02,791
I have a photo.

843
00:50:02,875 --> 00:50:03,959
You do?

844
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:05,711
Can you show me?

845
00:50:06,378 --> 00:50:07,379
Yes.

846
00:50:21,894 --> 00:50:24,271
We submit the photo
of the defendant's father as evidence.

847
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:40,704
From where I'm standing,

848
00:50:41,664 --> 00:50:44,875
I don't really see your father's face.

849
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:49,129
I was worried

850
00:50:50,339 --> 00:50:53,092
my mom would be sad if I drew him,

851
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:55,261
so I hid it.

852
00:50:55,344 --> 00:50:56,679
Where?

853
00:50:57,263 --> 00:50:59,306
How can we see his face?

854
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:03,060
If you shine a light on it
in a dark room,

855
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:04,770
you can see it.

856
00:51:05,813 --> 00:51:07,273
Can I check for myself?

857
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:15,155
We request the lights in the courtroom
to be turned off.

858
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:34,466
AMUSEMENT PARK BY MOON JEONG-HYE

859
00:51:40,389 --> 00:51:41,557
- There it is.
- It's true.

860
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:42,975
- It's real.
- That's her dad.

861
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:44,310
- It changed.
- It's her dad.

862
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:48,480
There really is a face.

863
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:51,817
<i>My dad.</i>

864
00:51:52,148 --> 00:51:53,925
FORTY MINUTES AGO

865
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:55,904
I drew my dad.

866
00:51:58,324 --> 00:51:59,658
Your dad?

867
00:52:04,455 --> 00:52:07,374
I couldn't see anything.

868
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:10,044
No. I did draw my dad.

869
00:52:10,586 --> 00:52:11,545
But…

870
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:15,132
it's a secret.

871
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:19,428
You can see it
when my mom turns off the lights.

872
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:21,055
My dad's face.

873
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:24,600
I like it.

874
00:52:26,352 --> 00:52:27,770
It makes me happy.

875
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:33,192
Drawing his face makes me happy

876
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:36,654
and so does looking at a painting of him.

877
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:43,369
<i>Jeong-hye loves her mom</i>
<i>more than anyone else in the world.</i>

878
00:52:43,452 --> 00:52:45,287
<i>Her world revolves around her mom.</i>

879
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:52,461
<i>- Jeong-hye is a special person.</i>
- Clean it well.

880
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:54,129
<i>Her intellectual abilities aren't low.</i>

881
00:52:54,213 --> 00:52:56,256
<i>- It may be more accurate to say…</i>
- Jeong-hye.

882
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:57,925
- Don't listen to him.
<i>- …that her talents</i>

883
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:00,052
<i>are focused on one area instead.</i>

884
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:03,430
<i>Jeong-hye is a tetrachromat.</i>

885
00:53:03,931 --> 00:53:08,102
<i>The average human eye can detect</i>
<i>about a million colors,</i>

886
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:11,438
<i>but a tetrachromat's eye</i>
<i>can detect 100 million colors.</i>

887
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:12,940
<i>Truly a flawless eye for color.</i>

888
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:17,861
<i>And with her genius skills,</i>
<i>she just wanted to draw</i>

889
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:19,196
<i>one thing.</i>

890
00:53:20,364 --> 00:53:21,573
<i>The father she missed.</i>

891
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:32,418
<i>Jeong-hye's father abandoned</i>
<i>her and her mother</i>

892
00:53:32,501 --> 00:53:35,045
<i>when she was 12 years old.</i>

893
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:40,592
<i>After he left, her mother</i>
<i>burned all photos of him.</i>

894
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:48,475
<i>And because her mother got mad</i>

895
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:50,519
<i>every time she mentioned her father,</i>

896
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:54,481
<i>Jeong-hye could no longer talk about him.</i>

897
00:53:58,277 --> 00:53:59,903
Dad left.

898
00:53:59,987 --> 00:54:02,489
He doesn't live with us anymore.

899
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:06,618
<i>When Jeong-hye could not talk</i>
<i>about how she missed her dad,</i>

900
00:54:06,702 --> 00:54:09,747
<i>she decided to draw him instead.</i>

901
00:54:10,289 --> 00:54:14,460
<i>However, she loved her mother so much</i>

902
00:54:14,543 --> 00:54:17,171
<i>that she decided to draw him in secret</i>

903
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:21,091
<i>to avoid making her mother sad.</i>

904
00:54:22,718 --> 00:54:26,638
<i>This was possible for Jeong-hye, who was</i>
<i>an artistic genius and a tetrachromat.</i>

905
00:54:30,017 --> 00:54:31,560
<i>All her paintings looked like</i>

906
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:34,646
<i>vibrant landscapes on the surface,</i>

907
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:37,983
<i>but when lit</i>
<i>at a certain illuminance in the dark,</i>

908
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:40,986
<i>the carefully hidden image</i>
<i>of her father would appear.</i>

909
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:44,406
<i>With her innate gift,</i>

910
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:47,576
<i>she was able to make every stroke</i>
<i>without ever making a mistake</i>

911
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:49,244
<i>to meticulously layer</i>

912
00:54:49,328 --> 00:54:52,748
<i>visual textures, color intensity,</i>
<i>and contrast in value.</i>

913
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:56,752
<i>And by using fluorescent colors,</i>

914
00:54:56,835 --> 00:55:01,048
<i>she managed to complete works</i>
<i>that contained hidden images of her father</i>

915
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:04,468
<i>that would only be revealed</i>
<i>under certain lighting conditions.</i>

916
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:06,637
These are Jeong-hye's paintings.

917
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,806
I had them in the car, so I brought them.

918
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:14,311
I got the flashlight.

919
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:15,562
- Hold on.
- But why…

920
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:20,943
Here.

921
00:55:55,686 --> 00:55:57,020
My poor baby.

922
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:01,358
Jeong-hye.

923
00:56:04,862 --> 00:56:05,863
Right.

924
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:09,616
I'm sorry.

925
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:13,579
I really didn't know…

926
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:15,664
I didn't know…

927
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:25,507
you missed your dad that much.

928
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:31,972
So that's why you did that.

929
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:35,642
That's why every time
you finished a painting,

930
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:39,146
you would give it a big hug.

931
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:45,277
Jeong-hye, it's okay.

932
00:56:46,278 --> 00:56:48,322
You can miss him.

933
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:51,450
You can draw him.

934
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:53,118
And also…

935
00:56:55,579 --> 00:56:57,831
you can talk to me about him.

936
00:56:58,457 --> 00:56:59,499
It's all okay.

937
00:57:06,173 --> 00:57:07,049
Jeong-hye.

938
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:13,221
If I ask you about your paintings
in the courtroom,

939
00:57:14,014 --> 00:57:15,474
can you explain everything?

940
00:57:21,563 --> 00:57:22,522
Jeong-hye.

941
00:57:23,315 --> 00:57:25,984
You can tell everyone
about how you drew your dad.

942
00:57:27,319 --> 00:57:28,820
I promise I'm okay with it.

943
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:30,739
Okay?

944
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:32,866
- Okay?
- Okay.

945
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:36,244
Yes.

946
00:57:49,341 --> 00:57:52,135
Then shall we take a look
at <i>Fiesta </i>in the same manner?

947
00:57:55,806 --> 00:57:56,765
What if it's there too?

948
00:57:57,538 --> 00:57:59,726
Then he's the one who copied her.

949
00:58:01,061 --> 00:58:02,145
It's there too.

950
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:15,283
This changes everything.

951
00:58:21,415 --> 00:58:24,501
We request that the plaintiff
take the stand again.

952
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:29,756
How did the face of the defendant's father

953
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,675
end up in your work?

954
00:58:32,426 --> 00:58:33,301
Well…

955
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:37,264
You claimed there was
no hidden image in it earlier.

956
00:58:45,147 --> 00:58:46,648
You must not have known.

957
00:58:47,566 --> 00:58:51,445
Because you were not the one
who painted the original.

958
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:55,532
The defendant did not copy
the plaintiff's work.

959
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:58,035
The plaintiff copied the defendant's work.

960
00:58:58,118 --> 00:59:01,496
You are the one who committed
copyright infringement, are you not?

961
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:04,416
And without even knowing
about the hidden image,

962
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:08,003
you filed a suit against the defendant
to frame her, did you not?

963
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:10,172
Mr. Ryu, answer the question.

964
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:14,342
Yes, that is correct.

965
00:59:21,850 --> 00:59:22,809
Apologize.

966
00:59:24,436 --> 00:59:27,314
For exploiting prejudice
to falsely accuse Ms. Moon

967
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:30,150
and for mocking
and belittling her in court

968
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:32,527
to cover up your own theft.

969
00:59:32,611 --> 00:59:33,695
Apologize.

970
00:59:33,779 --> 00:59:35,655
Objection, Your Honor. The counsel--

971
00:59:35,739 --> 00:59:36,698
Apologize?

972
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:38,533
Are you mad?

973
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:43,747
If anyone should apologize,

974
00:59:45,082 --> 00:59:47,834
it should be God apologizing to me.

975
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:51,630
For giving such insane talent
to an amateur like her and not me.

976
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:53,507
Apologize to me. And you…

977
00:59:54,758 --> 00:59:57,344
You should thank me.

978
00:59:58,136 --> 00:59:59,179
Your art…

979
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,099
Your artwork.

980
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:05,602
You don't even know how great it is.

981
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:09,147
You, an uncultured nobody,
is about to become a star overnight.

982
01:00:09,231 --> 01:00:10,899
I worked myself to the bone,

983
01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:14,528
and I suffered festering wounds

984
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:18,949
to build this pedestal,
and you just hitched a free ride!

985
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:21,284
Damn it…

986
01:00:22,661 --> 01:00:26,832
Imitation is
the sincerest form of flattery.

987
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:31,962
You, who can't show basic respect
to someone you admire and envy,

988
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:34,422
are the uncultured nobody
who knows nothing about art.

989
01:00:35,966 --> 01:00:38,176
You will have to apologize

990
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:41,471
formally, properly, and profusely.

991
01:00:42,931 --> 01:00:45,350
And, of course, compensate her.

992
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:52,023
The law exists…

993
01:00:56,027 --> 01:00:58,738
to take care of people like you.

994
01:01:07,414 --> 01:01:09,499
I… Hey!

995
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:11,293
- Mr. Ryu.
- Hey!

996
01:01:11,376 --> 01:01:12,794
- Mr. Ryu, please be quiet!
- If…

997
01:01:13,545 --> 01:01:15,255
If it weren't for my discerning eye…

998
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:17,674
If I had not discovered this artwork,

999
01:01:18,175 --> 01:01:21,469
your artwork would just be
stuck at the flea market…

1000
01:01:21,553 --> 01:01:22,888
Please compose yourself, Mr. Ryu.

1001
01:01:22,971 --> 01:01:25,015
It was my discerning eye
that made it happen!

1002
01:01:25,098 --> 01:01:26,433
Mr. Ryu!

1003
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:28,059
- Yes.
- Please sit down.

1004
01:01:28,143 --> 01:01:29,102
- I'm done.
- So annoying.

1005
01:01:29,186 --> 01:01:30,979
- He can't stop complaining.
- What?

1006
01:01:31,062 --> 01:01:32,814
- Let go of me!
- Mr. Ryu!

1007
01:01:32,898 --> 01:01:34,858
- Why?
- What are you doing?

1008
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:36,630
COURT IN SESSION

1009
01:01:36,735 --> 01:01:37,986
Kang Hyo-min.

1010
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:40,322
That was the coolest I've ever seen you.

1011
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:41,281
Really?

1012
01:01:42,741 --> 01:01:43,825
Congrats on your debut.

1013
01:01:44,659 --> 01:01:46,244
I'm so jealous.

1014
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:48,538
But where did Mr. Hong go?

1015
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:52,167
I haven't seen him
since the court reconvened after recess.

1016
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:54,044
Too bad he missed that knockout blow.

1017
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:55,587
- Ms. Kang.
- Where did he disappear to?

1018
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:57,255
Who knows?
But what an impact. Boom!

1019
01:01:57,339 --> 01:01:58,924
- Just one hit…
- Ms. Kang…

1020
01:01:59,007 --> 01:02:00,133
Attorney Kang.

1021
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:11,061
Were you calling me?

1022
01:02:14,648 --> 01:02:16,608
You dropped your keychain.

1023
01:02:17,525 --> 01:02:18,443
Thank you.

1024
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:22,864
See you back at the office.

1025
01:02:30,038 --> 01:02:31,957
I'll do my best, sir!

1026
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:37,087
Wait,

1027
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:41,591
did Mr. Yoon just address you
as "Attorney Kang"?

1028
01:02:44,803 --> 01:02:46,763
- Kang Hyo-min!
- Amazing!

1029
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:48,890
He called you an attorney
because you are one.

1030
01:02:48,974 --> 01:02:50,684
Why am I getting emotional?

1031
01:02:51,268 --> 01:02:53,103
- You <i>were</i> pretty cool.
- I know, right?

1032
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:54,604
You know what?

1033
01:02:55,397 --> 01:02:56,439
You're treating us today.

1034
01:02:56,523 --> 01:02:57,941
- Gosh.
- Deal!

1035
01:02:58,024 --> 01:02:59,025
- Let's go.
- Deal!

1036
01:03:17,836 --> 01:03:18,837
MY SISTER
THANKS, HYO-MIN

1037
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:23,967
<i>Thanks, Hyo-min.</i>

1038
01:03:26,303 --> 01:03:27,679
<i>I'm glad it all worked out.</i>

1039
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:29,556
MY SISTER

1040
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:32,976
<i>Jeong-hye's paintings always seemed</i>
<i>full of happiness,</i>

1041
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:35,228
<i>so I never knew she lived</i>
<i>with such longing.</i>

1042
01:03:35,979 --> 01:03:36,938
<i>Yeah.</i>

1043
01:03:37,522 --> 01:03:40,775
<i>Did you know Jeong-hye was an art prodigy?</i>

1044
01:03:43,111 --> 01:03:43,987
<i>No.</i>

1045
01:03:45,155 --> 01:03:47,449
<i>If I were a prodigy like Jeong-hye,</i>

1046
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:49,909
<i>would Auntie have raised me</i>
<i>despite my disability?</i>

1047
01:03:54,164 --> 01:03:55,707
<i>I'm sorry, Hyo-ju.</i>

1048
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:01,302
I'M SORRY, HYO-JU

1049
01:04:04,341 --> 01:04:07,052
<i>Mom also regrets sending you away.</i>

1050
01:04:11,806 --> 01:04:13,088
MOM ALSO REGRETS SENDING YOU AWAY

1051
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:16,644
<i>Any recent photos of Auntie?</i>

1052
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:21,149
<i>Why do you ask?</i>

1053
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:22,984
<i>Do you miss Mom?</i>

1054
01:04:24,903 --> 01:04:27,989
<i>Of course I do. She gave birth to me.</i>

1055
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,534
<i>Then why don't you visit her?</i>

1056
01:04:34,162 --> 01:04:39,000
<i>Probably for the same reason</i>
<i>why Jeong-hye hid her dad's face</i>

1057
01:04:39,084 --> 01:04:40,251
<i>in her paintings.</i>

1058
01:04:40,335 --> 01:04:42,670
<i>I'm more worried about my mom being sad</i>

1059
01:04:42,754 --> 01:04:45,757
<i>than I am about getting to see Auntie.</i>

1060
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:49,552
<i>My mom and dad use sign language.</i>

1061
01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:51,012
<i>I'm the only one reading lips.</i>

1062
01:04:51,638 --> 01:04:55,308
<i>They want to make it look like</i>
<i>I can hear when I see Auntie and Uncle.</i>

1063
01:04:56,226 --> 01:04:58,853
<i>I think Jeong-hye's mother</i>
<i>was like that too.</i>

1064
01:04:59,354 --> 01:05:01,856
<i>Is that what a parent's love is like?</i>

1065
01:05:07,779 --> 01:05:09,218
IS THAT WHAT A PARENT'S LOVE IS LIKE?

1066
01:05:17,831 --> 01:05:19,290
- What's going on?
- Hey.

1067
01:05:19,374 --> 01:05:21,376
There's supposed to be
a big announcement today.

1068
01:05:32,512 --> 01:05:34,764
Wow, the named partners.

1069
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:36,683
Who?

1070
01:05:37,475 --> 01:05:39,477
Yullim is Shin, Ko & Kim.

1071
01:05:39,561 --> 01:05:42,188
- Right.
- Mr. Shin Myeong-jin.

1072
01:05:42,272 --> 01:05:44,441
Mr. Ko Seung-cheol.

1073
01:05:44,524 --> 01:05:46,693
And Mr. Kim Yul-seong.

1074
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:50,613
Since time is money for everyone here,

1075
01:05:50,697 --> 01:05:51,656
I'll keep this short.

1076
01:05:51,739 --> 01:05:55,034
I've gathered you
for an important announcement.

1077
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:59,289
As of today, I'll be retired
but staying on as an advisor.

1078
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:02,167
What's going on here?

1079
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:04,377
Now, I'd like to introduce my successor,

1080
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:09,340
our new managing partner.

1081
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:11,468
Ms. Kwon Na-yeon.

1082
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:13,803
Please step up.

1083
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:16,097
The attorney whose name
is a brand in itself?

1084
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:24,499
BEYOND THE BAR

1085
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:27,210
<i>My ex-boyfriend did this to me.</i>

1086
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:28,711
I want to sue him.

1087
01:07:28,795 --> 01:07:31,422
If the client did not consent
to the sadistic act,

1088
01:07:31,506 --> 01:07:33,675
it could constitute assault.

1089
01:07:33,758 --> 01:07:35,343
<i>To establish assault,</i>

1090
01:07:35,426 --> 01:07:37,929
we'd have to argue
that the consent was not valid.

1091
01:07:38,012 --> 01:07:40,932
Can't we say love is
a form of diminished capacity too?

1092
01:07:42,183 --> 01:07:43,518
Let me get you some new ones.

1093
01:07:46,229 --> 01:07:48,439
<i>I didn't realize you were</i>
<i>the opposing counsel,</i>

1094
01:07:48,523 --> 01:07:50,156
so I said more than I should have.

1095
01:07:50,233 --> 01:07:51,526
<i>How do you know Mr. Jung?</i>

1096
01:07:51,609 --> 01:07:53,820
Forming a close relationship
with the opposing party

1097
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:55,780
violates the duty
to uphold professional dignity.

1098
01:07:55,863 --> 01:07:58,157
What are you doing
acting like some cheap attorney?

1099
01:07:58,241 --> 01:08:00,201
The chances of winning this case are slim.
