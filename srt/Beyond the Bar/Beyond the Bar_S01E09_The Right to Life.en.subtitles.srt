1
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:35,953
BEYOND THE BAR

2
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,874
Do you remember?

3
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:43,210
Of course she does.
She was eight. Why wouldn't she?

4
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:45,212
Well, she was young, so she might not.

5
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:51,385
Because I can't do it.

6
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:56,932
Sir!

7
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,810
Is there a doctor on board?

8
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:02,104
-Is anyone a doctor?
-I'm a doctor.

9
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:04,898
-Oh, you're--
-Can you help us?

10
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,359
Together now. One, two, three.

11
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,153
Let's get him on his back.

12
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:20,414
-He's a monster.
-Kim Byeong-su was arrested in Eunseong

13
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:22,624
on charges of kidnapping
and sexually assaulting

14
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:24,126
a seven-year-old girl.

15
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:28,380
Confirmed reports indicate
the victim has suffered

16
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:31,341
physical and psychological trauma
that could be life-threatening.

17
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:33,468
Mr. Kim claims he was intoxicated,

18
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:36,054
resulting in his diminished capacity
at the time of the crime.

19
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,307
APRIL 2015

20
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:39,516
Please make way.

21
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,491
What happened? What's her name?

22
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:58,577
Kim Min-sol. Age seven.

23
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,370
Min-sol.

24
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:02,331
Can you hear me, Min-sol?

25
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,390
Why did you wake up? Are you in pain?

26
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,309
Are you feeling okay?

27
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:23,977
It's all right.

28
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,898
Don't worry, I'll be right here.
You can go to sleep.

29
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:32,653
You're such a good girl. Sleep well now.

30
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,697
MAY 2020

31
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,325
Is it a stab wound?

32
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:53,215
No. I refuse to treat him.

33
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,967
It'll take 40 minutes
just to transport him to another hospital.

34
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:58,095
That would increase the risk of death.

35
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,138
-So?
-Pardon?

36
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:02,683
What's going on?

37
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:06,687
Well…

38
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,690
As a doctor, how could you say that?

39
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:11,733
Do you know how many hospitals
there are in Seoul?

40
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:14,736
I mean, what are the odds
he'd end up in my care?

41
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,280
Me, Min-sol's doctor, of all people?

42
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:20,409
This is a sign from above not to save him.

43
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:22,160
A doctor's job is to save people.

44
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:24,454
You don't get to decide
who deserves to live.

45
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,289
I'm not suggesting we kill him.

46
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,500
If he's dying anyway,
why not just let him?

47
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:29,668
How could you…

48
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:32,087
How can you say such things
and call yourself a doctor?

49
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,840
Did you not see the condition
Min-sol arrived in?

50
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:38,677
I still remember
every excruciating detail of that day.

51
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:42,180
The sheer brutality and cruelty
haunts me to this day.

52
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:46,017
A helpless seven-year-old child
had to go through that.

53
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:48,437
What if we save him,

54
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,897
and that leads
to another victim like Min-sol?

55
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:53,567
He'll be released in a few years,

56
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,861
and he will live on for decades.

57
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,362
I don't know about all that.

58
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:59,656
Right now,
all I see is a critical patient.

59
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:01,742
Move. I'll treat him.

60
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:09,249
Doctor.

61
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,710
Doctor!

62
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,295
Yes? Oh, right.

63
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,598
He is in cardiac tamponade.

64
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,058
Fluid is building up around his heart
and compressing it.

65
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:29,060
Emergency treatment is required.

66
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:31,605
Is there a pericardiocentesis needle
in the emergency kit?

67
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:32,689
Just a moment.

68
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:34,900
Let's get his shirt off first.

69
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,406
Hand me the gloves.

70
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,125
Hand me the needle.

71
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:18,777
Damn it.

72
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:31,998
THE RIGHT TO LIFE

73
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:39,714
So, you're just going to let her run free
after she let my son die?

74
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:42,551
DETECTIVE UNIT 2

75
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:43,552
I mean,

76
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:47,639
a doctor killed a person.
If that's not murder, then what is it?

77
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,683
The police just handle the investigations.

78
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,268
The prosecutor in charge will decide

79
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,770
whether to indict for murder
or a different offense.

80
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:56,940
You can talk to the prosecutor
after they're assigned.

81
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,694
That doctor intentionally killed
my husband.

82
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:01,820
That's why we're asking you

83
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,613
to share what we said with the prosecutor

84
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,615
or whoever has the power
to put her in jail.

85
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,450
That's exactly what I'm saying.

86
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:10,620
The last time my son
was in the emergency room,

87
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:13,331
I heard every word that wench said.

88
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:16,543
She clearly said
she wanted to kill my son.

89
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:20,672
She's been bitter
ever since she failed to kill him.

90
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:23,216
That's why when she saw him
on the plane this time,

91
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,218
she seized her chance
to kill him for good.

92
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,804
I can't believe this.

93
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:32,142
How could they have let
that murderer perform emergency care?

94
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:35,103
My goodness.

95
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:36,980
-How unlucky could one be?
-Mother…

96
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,608
Oh, Byeong-su.

97
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,069
My poor Byeong-su.

98
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:44,863
What?

99
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:47,741
Hey, gather around.

100
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,409
Come on. Hurry up.

101
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:51,494
No way…

102
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,622
JUNE PROMOTION NOTICE:
ATTORNEYS AND SECRETARIES

103
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:55,373
Do Seung-jae?

104
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,668
The ultimate salary thief at Yullim
is becoming a partner?

105
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:01,087
Surely that's taking it too far.

106
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:06,301
Most associates on this list
are notorious salary thieves.

107
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,345
I thought with Ms. Kwon at the helm,

108
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,764
the promotion system
would become more fair.

109
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,432
This is just not right.

110
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:15,977
Just be a little patient.
All these people will be gone soon enough.

111
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:20,398
Even if they survive,
their days as salary thieves are over.

112
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:23,902
Have you given it some thought?

113
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,739
Yes, I have.

114
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:32,994
But I like where I am now.

115
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:35,246
I think I suffered enough at Yullim.

116
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:37,624
I don't want to repeat that.

117
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:38,917
You must know

118
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:42,087
that your talents are being wasted
as an in-house counsel

119
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,713
at a mid-sized company.

120
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,256
Does that really matter?

121
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:47,133
Peace of mind is enough.

122
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,472
I can't promise anything else,

123
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,100
but I can promise you this.

124
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:59,896
I'm going to make Yullim
a place of justice.

125
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,607
My definition of justice is quite simple.

126
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:05,151
A system that evaluates
everyone's abilities impartially

127
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:08,321
and allows people to succeed fairly
through effort and talent.

128
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:13,535
You will end up being
the greatest beneficiary of that system.

129
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,878
-Min-jeong.
-I'm busy.

130
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,140
Hey, Min-jeong.

131
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,017
Oh, right. I have that thing.

132
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:41,688
What's wrong with her?

133
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,782
I'm busy.

134
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:56,202
Let's go grab a bite.

135
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:57,370
I have plans.

136
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,123
What are you looking at?

137
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,917
Please leave. Let's talk later.

138
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:05,837
Leave.

139
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:09,883
It's Heo Min-jeong from Yullim.

140
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:13,344
On page 39
of the legal due diligence report,

141
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:17,223
I think we should double-check
whether the enforcement

142
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:20,894
of the senior lender's security interest
could trigger a change of control.

143
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,604
The senior loan…

144
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,814
Kim Byeong-su's wife and mother

145
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,275
come to the hospital every day

146
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,360
to scream at me about being a murderer.

147
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:32,155
They even spat in my face.

148
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,160
What are they after?

149
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:38,828
Well,

150
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,331
it's probably money.

151
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,000
And they keep threatening to file

152
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,710
criminal charges for murder.

153
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:50,757
What will happen to her
if she's indicted for murder?

154
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,760
You need to prove intent
for a murder charge.

155
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:56,304
Are they claiming
you intentionally killed him?

156
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,556
Yes, it seems so.

157
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,475
Could there be a reason for that?

158
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:03,853
A few years ago,

159
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:08,650
Mr. Kim was brought to the ER
after being stabbed while in custody.

160
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:12,445
And I refused to treat him.

161
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:16,658
It seems they heard me
talk about him back then.

162
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,202
That's only scratching the surface.

163
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,539
There couldn't be a worse twist of fate.

164
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,917
My wife was the doctor
who treated the child victim.

165
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,460
Then, a few years later,

166
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:30,296
he ended up needing emergency care

167
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,383
and was transported
to her hospital of all places. Right?

168
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:39,139
And you saw him again on the plane?

169
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,099
Yes.

170
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:42,934
A cruel twist of fate indeed.

171
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:48,022
Do you remember what you said
when you refused to treat him?

172
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:49,858
Back then,

173
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,529
I was so worked up,
so I don't remember exactly.

174
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:59,325
But I think I said, "He doesn't deserve
to live. Just let him die."

175
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:02,996
"Saving him might lead
to more victimized children."

176
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,415
I believe it was
something along those lines.

177
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:09,294
But to be fair, I wasn't wrong.

178
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:12,505
Even though he failed in the end,

179
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:15,049
he still attempted another kidnapping
of an eight-year-old girl.

180
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:16,176
Yes, that's right.

181
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,887
It hasn't been released to the press yet,

182
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,723
but the report was filed,
and the investigation was underway.

183
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:26,853
Although the investigation
closed when he died.

184
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,564
Then was he on the plane to…

185
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:32,942
Yes, it seems he was trying
to flee overseas.

186
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,575
I need to ask you one question.

187
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:42,827
Yes?

188
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:44,746
Did you intentionally kill him?

189
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,790
Sir, that question is a bit…

190
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:51,961
No.

191
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,133
Okay.

192
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,179
We just need to confirm that
as a formality.

193
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:02,180
I see.

194
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,895
My heart was racing
as I was sitting there listening.

195
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:12,607
Come on. Of course not.
She wouldn't have killed him on purpose.

196
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,902
If she really wanted to kill him,
she could've just refused to treat him.

197
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,445
Why bother pretending to save him?

198
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,072
You don't know that.

199
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,408
The prosecution could argue
that Dr. Choi didn't know it was him

200
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,035
and went to provide emergency care

201
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:27,413
but then changed her mind
once she found out who he was.

202
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:29,040
That's just wrong.

203
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,250
Dr. Choi might have said

204
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,835
she wanted to kill him
in the heat of the moment,

205
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,796
but there is a huge difference

206
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,548
between wanting someone dead
and actually killing them.

207
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:39,008
That's true.

208
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,178
Honestly, if I'd been in her shoes,

209
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:45,014
I also might have refused
to treat that monster.

210
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,725
He did not deserve to be saved.

211
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:48,893
Really?

212
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:51,354
And here I thought you were
a highly ethical physician,

213
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,106
committed to the Hippocratic Oath.

214
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,608
Yes, you are right about that.

215
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:59,195
"The worth of a life
is not relative but absolute."

216
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,614
"No life shall be ranked above another."

217
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:04,826
"All life must be treated equally."

218
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:05,785
However…

219
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:07,537
However?

220
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,163
I hope

221
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:14,794
Dr. Choi is declared
innocent without question.

222
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,922
-Me too.
-Me too.

223
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:25,221
So, for Father's birthday this year,

224
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:28,099
I'll be bringing
some homemade braised short ribs.

225
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,268
How much are you going to make this time?

226
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,645
I get nervous whenever you say
you're going to cook.

227
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:35,356
You go so overboard in the kitchen.

228
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,443
Listen, we have
over 100 people in our family.

229
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:42,697
You won't find
a big family like ours anywhere else.

230
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,532
It's seriously embarrassing.

231
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:48,036
You don't know how lucky you are.
This is a blessing.

232
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:49,829
Why is the youngest so quiet?

233
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,372
I'm here. I'm listening.

234
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:52,582
Oh, that's right.

235
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,376
Remember my friend, Kwak Hye-jeong?

236
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:58,171
Yeah, I heard she was filing for divorce.

237
00:13:58,796 --> 00:13:59,839
She is.

238
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,716
She's been going through hell

239
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:04,802
fighting her husband's lawyer
over the division of assets.

240
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:08,473
Apparently, he has a top divorce lawyer,

241
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,516
and her lawyer is falling a bit short.

242
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,977
So she asked me to find out

243
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,731
if my youngest brother
and his very reputable law firm

244
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,566
could possibly take on her case.

245
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:21,736
No, I'm too busy.
Tell her to find someone else.

246
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,654
Seriously?

247
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:25,698
She's a close friend of mine.

248
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,700
I normally don't handle divorces anyway.

249
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:30,620
My colleague, Ms. Heo, usually handles…

250
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,336
On second thought, sure.

251
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,421
-I'll take it on.
-Really?

252
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:44,050
Of course, I should help her.
You said she was a close friend.

253
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,511
Give her my card
and tell her to stop by my office.

254
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,262
This is a surprise.

255
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:50,348
No, actually, while you're at it,

256
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:53,142
ask her if she can stop by tomorrow.

257
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,727
-Should I?
-Totally.

258
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:57,855
-Fantastic.
-Our baby is all grown up now.

259
00:14:57,939 --> 00:14:59,440
Damn it. Stop calling me a baby.

260
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:01,109
Our cute little baby.

261
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:03,111
"Cute little baby"
is definitely off limits.

262
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:07,448
PARTNER APPOINTMENT CEREMONY

263
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,077
-Welcome.
-I look forward to working with you.

264
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:19,627
-Let's do great things together.
-You'll have my full dedication.

265
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,884
-I'm expecting great things.
-Yes, I'll do my best.

266
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:34,892
-Congratulations.
-I'll give it my all.

267
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:41,691
"We hereby appoint the above individual
as a partner of Yullim Law Firm."

268
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,067
"Do Seung-jae, Esquire."

269
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:48,698
What's with all the sulking?

270
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:52,493
Aren't you happy to have made partner
two or three years earlier than most?

271
00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:00,084
Did you even read
the partner agreement before signing it?

272
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:02,170
You know I hate reading contracts.

273
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:03,504
I figured as much.

274
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:09,969
We're officially hanging by a thread now.

275
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,512
We don't even get a base salary.

276
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:13,556
What are you talking about?

277
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:17,393
After Ms. Kwon became
the managing partner,

278
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,353
she did a complete overhaul
of the pay structure.

279
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:21,022
Now, all partners are compensated

280
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,691
through provisional payment
based on case intake or performance.

281
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,193
There is no fixed salary anymore.

282
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:26,152
Also,

283
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,739
contract renewal will be determined
annually based on performance.

284
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:30,907
What?

285
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:34,535
If you keep performing like you do now,

286
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:37,455
your paycheck next month will be zero won.

287
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:39,916
And forget about getting renewed.

288
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,209
What did you just say?

289
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:46,005
This is just taking it way too far, sir.

290
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,007
What exactly did we mess up so badly?

291
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,762
Sir, are you really
just going to stand by and watch?

292
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:56,641
We are Yullim, and Yullim is us.

293
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:59,977
Organizational restructuring?
Sure, it sounds good in theory,

294
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:03,397
but at the end of the day,
she is just tearing Yullim apart.

295
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:05,608
Listen,

296
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,694
I stepped down
as managing partner some time ago.

297
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,864
Kwon Na-yeon is now
the managing partner at Yullim.

298
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:15,076
Sir, are you really
going to abandon us like this?

299
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:18,663
Abandon you?
How could you say such a thing?

300
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,123
I am frustrated
with the situation as well.

301
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:24,001
But I already handed over
my managerial authority to her.

302
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:27,380
I would be overstepping
if I start telling her what to do.

303
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,924
It would be bad optics.

304
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,760
I mean, even Kwon Na-yeon

305
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,887
would listen to what you have to say.

306
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,722
Perhaps a little off-the-record chat--

307
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:40,101
Come on now. There you go again with that.

308
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,103
You just sound politically tone-deaf.

309
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:45,147
Just take a second and think about it.

310
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:47,608
Do you think Kwon Na-yeon
would even listen to me?

311
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,364
Fine, I'll try to talk to her.

312
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,366
But I can't guarantee anything.

313
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,952
Thank you, sir. We appreciate it.

314
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:00,746
We're counting on you, sir.

315
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,292
-All right.
-We believe in you.

316
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,918
Sure. Take care now.

317
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:13,843
You don't know what you did wrong?

318
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:20,224
There is no greater offense
than incompetence.

319
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:23,519
Hey.

320
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,105
Are you almost done
with the restructuring?

321
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,400
All right.

322
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,569
Let's start preparing now.

323
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,529
Bye.

324
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:58,804
Kim Byeong-su's family is pushing hard
for a murder indictment,

325
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:01,349
and given her past refusal to treat him
and previous remarks,

326
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:02,975
that indictment is highly probable.

327
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,269
I believe we should submit
an opinion brief

328
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:07,605
before the indictment is finalized
to stop it.

329
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:09,690
What about negligent manslaughter?

330
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:12,818
Given his death,
that charge seems unavoidable.

331
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:14,987
We must prove

332
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:18,449
that there was no direct causal link
between the act and the death.

333
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,535
Have we secured an expert witness?

334
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:24,372
Yes, we are meeting
with some doctors today.

335
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,666
I'm sure some doctors will oppose.

336
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:28,376
They'll cite medical ethics

337
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:31,087
and take issue
with Ms. Choi's prior refusal to treat him

338
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,005
or her past remarks about him.

339
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:36,300
We must secure
as many expert opinions as we can

340
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:39,387
to prepare for the possibility of opinions
favoring the prosecution.

341
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,846
Understood.

342
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:48,187
I have twin sisters
who are seven years old.

343
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,399
We live ten minutes away
from where Kim Byeong-su used to live.

344
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,943
I'd like to be assigned
to this case as well.

345
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:55,611
-Me--
-Me too!

346
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,739
These kids.

347
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:04,870
Fine, I'll allow it.

348
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:08,833
The truth

349
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:12,878
can look very different,
depending on how light is cast on it.

350
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,632
Attorneys do not distort the truth.

351
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:21,846
We help ensure
it doesn't get skewed in the wrong light

352
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:26,267
due to a client's legal inexperience
or the inflexibility of the law.

353
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,317
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

354
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:42,950
Mr. Yoon.

355
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:46,454
I'm considering taking on a divorce case
that involves an acquaintance of mine.

356
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:48,247
Divorce is Ms. Heo Min-jeong's specialty--

357
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,040
I was hoping to co-chair with her.

358
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,251
Well, if you involve Ms. Heo,

359
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,961
Mr. Kim may contest acquisition credit--

360
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:56,088
She can take the acquisition
and performance credit.

361
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:57,506
I'll just do the work.

362
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:00,551
Aren't you busy?

363
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:02,762
I am.

364
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:03,763
Then why?

365
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:07,516
It seems like a good opportunity
to learn about the process.

366
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,477
Do as you wish.

367
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,644
Thank you, sir.

368
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:14,774
I guess I'm finally taking on
a divorce case.

369
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:18,569
I'm sorry for being late.

370
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:21,322
Not at all. We were early.

371
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:25,201
This is a paralegal from my team.

372
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,787
I wanted to introduce you
to one of the unsung heroes

373
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,873
behind the recent Seonul M&A
you spearheaded.

374
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:33,667
I apologize for springing this on you.
Do you mind if he joins us?

375
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:35,044
Not at all.

376
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,797
Hello, ma'am.
My name is Choi Yun-geun.

377
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:41,801
It's truly an honor to meet you like this.

378
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:44,011
It's nice to meet you. Shall we sit?

379
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,054
Sure.

380
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:50,100
Mr. Choi here is actually a lawyer.

381
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:52,728
Is that so?
Then why are you working as a paralegal?

382
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:57,650
To tell you the truth,
I graduated from a regional law school,

383
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,527
and my grades weren't great, either.

384
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:02,446
And my bar exam score
was a bit low as well.

385
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:06,200
I couldn't set foot
in a major firm like Yullim as a lawyer.

386
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,410
I see.

387
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:11,372
But when I put him to work,
I realized he's quite good.

388
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,791
Unlike most young people nowadays,
he has good etiquette.

389
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:16,043
And quite cost-effective as well.

390
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:18,796
Paralegals cost a quarter
of what associates cost.

391
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:19,755
I see.

392
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,799
Someone as low on the ladder as me

393
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:24,093
would never normally
get a chance to meet you.

394
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,262
To share a meal with you like this

395
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,514
is truly a great honor.

396
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,016
Thank you for saying that.

397
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:36,188
Thank you for the great meal.

398
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:40,067
I'd be grateful for another chance
like this in the future.

399
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,862
I enjoyed it as well.

400
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:46,073
But please excuse me. I need to get going.

401
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,283
Sure.

402
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,410
Please let me pick up the check.

403
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,586
I'm sorry, sir, but your card was denied.

404
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:02,673
Pardon? That's not possible.

405
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,136
Why don't you two go on ahead?

406
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,888
Why? Is the card not going through?

407
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:10,848
No, it's not that.

408
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:13,684
Don't worry about it.
Just wait for me in the car.

409
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:16,520
-Okay. Let's go.
-Okay.

410
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:22,192
Sorry, just a second. That's weird.

411
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:23,152
Mr. Lee!

412
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:28,782
Gosh. Ms. Kwon.

413
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:34,038
I'm terribly embarrassed.

414
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:36,582
I'll be sure to pay you back later.

415
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:38,709
It was my pleasure.

416
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,336
Have you been well?

417
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:43,297
I've been meaning to reach out
to see how you were doing.

418
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,425
I guess you haven't heard.

419
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,135
What do you mean?

420
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:51,555
I lost my company.

421
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:53,933
To Bluestone Fund.

422
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:55,976
Pardon? How?

423
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,691
Can you elaborate on what happened?

424
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:05,903
As you well know,

425
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:09,114
Hynic Core is like my life's work.

426
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:10,980
The NPU design algorithm
and software platform…

427
00:24:11,055 --> 00:24:12,624
AI, MACHINE LEARNING OPTIMIZED PROCESSOR

428
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:16,789
…were the result of years of dedication
by me and my research team.

429
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:19,083
Yes, I'm well aware.

430
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:23,295
Major corporations repeatedly tried
to buy your company for that technology.

431
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:26,548
Yes, but one finally managed to succeed.

432
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:29,760
Optalyn, a major U.S. corporation.

433
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:33,847
Didn't you say you would never sell?

434
00:24:34,765 --> 00:24:38,060
I was not the one who sold it.
Bluestone Fund did.

435
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:42,731
Bluestone initially invested
15 billion won in our company.

436
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:45,192
They accused us
of embezzlement and whatnot

437
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:46,986
before seizing
the entire company last year.

438
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:50,990
In the end, they sold it
to Optalyn for 120 billion won.

439
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:55,077
They bought it for 15 billion
and sold it for 120 billion.

440
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:58,622
For a mere 120 billion won.

441
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:03,085
Given the potential of that technology,

442
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,837
that price was a joke.

443
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:08,382
Bluestone has basically
sold out our country.

444
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:11,385
They carelessly gave away
core technology developed in Korea

445
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:14,013
to another nation,
just to line their own pockets.

446
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,641
If we'd had the chance
to fully develop that technology,

447
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:21,270
it could have fueled the next wave
of South Korea's economic growth.

448
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,649
So that's what happened.

449
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:33,657
Ms. Kwon met with Lee Seong-bin yesterday?

450
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,409
All right.

451
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:46,462
Hynic Core is Yullim's client,
not Lee Seong-bin.

452
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:49,131
Mr. Lee didn't actually embezzle anything.

453
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,841
-For the company's sake--
-Enough.

454
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,885
Stop acting like an amateur.

455
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:56,764
Aren't you aware that sort of consultation
directly violates the Attorney-at-Law Act?

456
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:01,435
I'll call a partner meeting
to discuss this issue.

457
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:03,604
You can explain yourself there.

458
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,022
-Sir.
-You may leave.

459
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:27,753
Hey.

460
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:30,047
It appears we'll need
to fast-track the plan.

461
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:35,469
Shouldn't we have a meeting?

462
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,596
-About what?
-About Ms. Kwak Hye-jeong's divorce.

463
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,723
I'll take care of that on my own.

464
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:41,350
Why?

465
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:44,269
What do you mean? It's my job.

466
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:45,437
It's my case.

467
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:48,857
No one said otherwise.
You hold onto that case.

468
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:50,734
But I'm going to work on it by myself.

469
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:51,944
I'll work on it too.

470
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:54,238
Have you worked on a divorce case before?

471
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:56,448
No. That's why I want to do it with you.

472
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:57,950
That's why I want to work alone.

473
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,034
Let's do it together.

474
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:02,121
-What's up with you?
-That's what I want to ask.

475
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:03,413
What do you mean?

476
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:07,376
You don't talk to me, eat with me,
drink with me, or grab coffee with me.

477
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,378
Now you won't even work with me.

478
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:12,381
Did I do something to upset you?

479
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,967
-No, you haven't.
-Then what's the matter?

480
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:18,762
Let's not do this.

481
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,223
Where are you taking me?

482
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:23,684
What's wrong with you?

483
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:25,394
I like you.

484
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:26,770
What?

485
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:27,855
No.

486
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:30,190
I love you.

487
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,360
You must have lost your mind.

488
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:34,528
Yeah. I'm going insane.

489
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,613
Move.

490
00:27:36,697 --> 00:27:38,824
-What do you want from me?
-I said I love you.

491
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:41,660
Do you pity me?

492
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:44,496
-As if you'd ever let me.
-This started after hearing about my past.

493
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,248
Yeah, you're right.

494
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,584
But I started liking you before that.

495
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:49,751
I had feelings for you,

496
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:52,963
but I held back because I didn't want
to ruin our relationship.

497
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:55,132
But once I went from just liking you

498
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:58,135
to liking you in spite of everything,
I knew for sure.

499
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:00,929
I'm telling you
because it's eating me up inside.

500
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:02,890
Because I'm about to go insane.

501
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,727
That's just complete nonsense.

502
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:24,870
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

503
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:25,954
PROSECUTOR KWON WON-HYEOP

504
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:27,873
So, what year are you?

505
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:28,999
I'm a first-year.

506
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:30,959
So you're a hatchling,
fresh out of the shell.

507
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:32,961
Yullim must be confident
to send a first-year

508
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:34,880
to such an important meeting.

509
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:39,218
May I ask what you plan to indict her for?

510
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:42,429
Murder.

511
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:47,476
Murder by willful negligence,

512
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,394
manslaughter
due to occupational negligence,

513
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:53,065
violation of the Medical Service Act,
and manslaughter by bodily injury.

514
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,026
Any of those could apply.

515
00:28:57,527 --> 00:29:00,656
We plan to submit
a thorough opinion brief,

516
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:03,825
so we'd appreciate it
if you could review it before you decide.

517
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:05,285
Sure, I will do that.

518
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:07,621
When will the autopsy results be out?

519
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:10,582
I'm not sure.
They'll be released when they're ready.

520
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:16,630
There was talk about the cause of death
being an aortic dissection.

521
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:21,301
I believe they also found
some underlying health issues.

522
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:23,011
-I see.
-Hold on.

523
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:25,681
I wrote down
the name of the disease somewhere.

524
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:28,725
Here it is.

525
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:30,018
VASCULAR EHLERS-DANLOS SYNDROME

526
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:33,230
I hear it's genetic.

527
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:36,692
They say it causes fatal complications,

528
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:39,027
like rupturing major arteries.

529
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:42,406
I guess he was destined to die anyway.

530
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:46,410
If that's the case,
Choi Ji-su is not liable at all.

531
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:48,453
There are no grounds for indictment.

532
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:51,748
Family medical history
plays a key in genetic disorders.

533
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:53,709
Were you able to acquire such materials?

534
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:57,170
And if I did?

535
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:02,634
Would it be possible for us
to request access?

536
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:06,305
If not, we would need to request
a court order for hospital records.

537
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:09,266
But these days, even with a court order,

538
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,435
both the National Health Insurance Service

539
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:13,937
and hospitals
often refuse to provide them.

540
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:15,480
We would really appreciate it.

541
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:18,608
You know such disclosure before indictment
is at our discretion, right?

542
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:19,609
Yes.

543
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:22,154
We would really appreciate it.

544
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:25,866
I'll think about it.

545
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:28,327
Thank you.

546
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,968
MAY LEAD TO SUDDEN DEATH

547
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:48,305
EDS HAS A HIGH MORTALITY RATE

548
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:50,057
COMPLICATIONS, ARTERIAL DISSECTION

549
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,269
KWON WON-HYEOP, PROSECUTOR

550
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:58,273
I just can't figure him out.

551
00:30:58,774 --> 00:30:59,941
What could he be thinking?

552
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:04,905
This is impossible.

553
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,782
There's only so much we can do.

554
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:08,742
I know, right?

555
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:11,328
We're all going to become
doctors at this rate.

556
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:15,707
I'm feeling sick
from reading all these medical texts.

557
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:21,546
In that case…

558
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,474
Who is she?

559
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,935
This is my best friend and roommate.

560
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:36,311
She's also a doctor.

561
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:42,526
The autopsy is currently underway,

562
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:46,154
but the prosecutor mentioned
the possibility of an aortic dissection.

563
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:47,531
Really?

564
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:50,742
Dr. Choi thought it was cardiac tamponade,

565
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:52,577
and she attempted a pericardiocentesis.

566
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:55,539
Right. According to our research,

567
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:59,334
a pericardiocentesis could be fatal
for a patient with aortic dissection.

568
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:02,087
Right. It could.

569
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:07,592
If the autopsy declares aortic dissection
to be the cause of death,

570
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,220
we'll be at quite a disadvantage.

571
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:12,764
I can see that.

572
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:16,852
That's why it's important for us
to prove that Kim Byeong-su

573
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,437
had a high-risk underlying illness.

574
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,564
I'm not sure
what the prosecutor's intentions are,

575
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:21,690
but he disclosed

576
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:25,318
that vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome
was identified during the autopsy.

577
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:27,737
vEDS?

578
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:30,240
-That's genetic.
-Yeah.

579
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:32,701
So we need to review
his family medical history.

580
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,703
But obtaining medical records
of another patient

581
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:35,829
is no easy feat nowadays.

582
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:39,166
Even if there's a court order,
my hospital doesn't release them.

583
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,793
Ta-da. I managed to acquire them.

584
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:43,545
What? How?

585
00:32:44,171 --> 00:32:46,673
I can tell you about that later.
If you look there, you'll see

586
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:50,886
that Mr. Kim's uncle died
of an aortic rupture in his forties.

587
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,972
And his paternal grandmother died
of a similar cause as well.

588
00:32:55,015 --> 00:32:55,891
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY

589
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,310
Aortic rupture.

590
00:32:58,393 --> 00:32:59,686
Bowel perforation.

591
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,732
Based on the symptoms outlined here,

592
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:07,694
it appears his uncle and grandmother
both suffered from vEDS.

593
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:11,907
Finally.

594
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,467
It's not coffee, but here.

595
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,135
Thank you.

596
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:43,980
It's good.

597
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:47,150
Right? It's the perfect coffee substitute.

598
00:33:47,234 --> 00:33:48,902
Yeah, it's nice.

599
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:51,738
My brain is clearing right up.

600
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,349
-What's wrong?
-I found it.

601
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:20,350
What?

602
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:22,477
It's a medical paper.

603
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:25,814
It discusses the correlation
between vEDS and aortic dissection.

604
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:39,369
Now we just need
to work it into the brief.

605
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:42,414
How about some fresh air before we do?

606
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:43,999
That sounds great.

607
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,917
I know the perfect spot.

608
00:34:46,001 --> 00:34:47,210
Where?

609
00:34:47,294 --> 00:34:48,336
Let's go.

610
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:54,342
What an amazing view.

611
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:56,177
-Isn't it nice?
-It is.

612
00:34:56,845 --> 00:34:59,264
I didn't know
the building had a place like this.

613
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:03,143
Did you say you have twin sisters?

614
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:04,185
Yes.

615
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:07,397
Seven years old?

616
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,356
Yes.

617
00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:10,358
That's quite an age gap.

618
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:12,944
Your parents must have
a very good relationship.

619
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:18,074
We don't have parents.

620
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:27,459
My mom had me as a single mother
when she was a teenager.

621
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,546
She disappeared when I was in high school.

622
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:34,132
Then she suddenly popped up
a few years later

623
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:37,302
to leave my half-siblings in my care
before leaving again.

624
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,973
It must have been tough.

625
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:46,353
But at seven,
they must require a lot of care.

626
00:35:46,436 --> 00:35:49,272
My aunt lives nearby and helps out a lot.

627
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:53,526
But they often go to
and back from school alone.

628
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:56,446
I was so anxious
when I heard Kim Byeong-su was released.

629
00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:01,618
And I let out a sigh of relief
when I heard he died.

630
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:06,331
I can't believe
someone's death brought me relief.

631
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:09,000
He reaped what he sowed.

632
00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:13,088
You know,

633
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,298
I'm a twin, too.

634
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:19,260
Really? I thought you were an only child.

635
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:21,221
My family has a few secrets.

636
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:22,889
And here I thought you grew up

637
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:25,392
in a prestigious family,
free from any struggles.

638
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:27,852
No family is without its struggles.

639
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:31,231
They say life looks
like a tragedy up close

640
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:33,942
and like a comedy from afar.

641
00:36:38,238 --> 00:36:41,324
This is something to talk about
with a friend over drinks,

642
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:44,077
not with a colleague over morning coffee.

643
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,578
No, it's perfect.

644
00:36:46,413 --> 00:36:48,206
Right. I guess it is.

645
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:50,291
Should we make a coffee toast
to our friendship?

646
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:52,127
That's the best thing I've heard all day.

647
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:02,095
Should we head back and finish that brief?

648
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:03,680
Sure, let's do it.

649
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:04,889
Let's go.

650
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:20,113
So you want to highlight
the fatal nature of vEDS

651
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:23,158
and the high mortality rate
of aortic dissection

652
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,910
to attribute Kim Byeong-su's death
to an underlying condition

653
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:27,746
and argue that there was
no direct causal link

654
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:30,165
between the emergency treatment
and his death

655
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:33,084
through pathological evidence?

656
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:34,544
Yes, that is correct.

657
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:36,421
With our research as the basis,

658
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:39,340
we plan to request a formal opinion
from a pathology expert.

659
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:41,760
Patients with aortic dissection

660
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:43,803
could exhibit symptoms
of cardiac tamponade,

661
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:45,305
but it would be virtually impossible

662
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:47,390
to distinguish between the two
on board an aircraft.

663
00:37:47,474 --> 00:37:48,933
There was no diagnostic equipment

664
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:51,895
and not enough time to properly assess
the patient's condition.

665
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:54,898
Furthermore,
given the similarity in symptoms

666
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:56,816
and the fact that vEDS is
a genetic disorder,

667
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,402
a proper diagnosis would've required
long-term observation,

668
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:01,905
including a review
of the patient's family medical history

669
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:03,406
and the patient's typical symptoms.

670
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:06,451
In such a constrained environment,
no doctor could've identified

671
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,328
all of this in a few minutes.

672
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:11,498
Medical malpractice is assessed

673
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:15,752
based on what other doctors
would've done in the same circumstances.

674
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:18,838
If we could get statements
from emergency medicine specialists

675
00:38:18,922 --> 00:38:21,299
that state her actions were appropriate,
given the constraints

676
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:23,843
of the in-flight conditions,
time, and limited medical history,

677
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:26,054
it could boost the chances of acquittal.

678
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,013
I see.

679
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:30,642
But…

680
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:36,064
what if Dr. Choi was aware
of Kim Byeong-su's preexisting condition?

681
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:39,984
If she knew…

682
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:42,946
If she did,

683
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:45,990
then it could be argued
that her medical judgment

684
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:49,536
wasn't the result
of environmental constraints

685
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:51,871
and was instead influenced
by a failure to recognize

686
00:38:51,955 --> 00:38:54,499
or an intentional disregard
of key information.

687
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:58,294
Especially if she attempted
pericardiocentesis,

688
00:38:58,378 --> 00:39:01,881
fully aware that it could be deadly
for a patient with aortic dissection,

689
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:03,299
her chances of being indicted

690
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:05,426
for involuntary manslaughter
would increase.

691
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:08,054
And if intent is suspected on top of that,

692
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:10,598
it could even lead to a murder charge.

693
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:12,350
At this moment,

694
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:16,187
no evidence suggests Dr. Choi
knew of his underlying condition.

695
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:23,319
Is there something that worries you?

696
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:29,534
Is what Kim Byeong-su's mother
and wife claim true?

697
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:32,370
Did you intentionally kill him?

698
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:36,583
No.

699
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,420
No, it's nothing.

700
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:44,257
Please finalize the opinion brief
by including the expert opinion

701
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:47,135
and pathological analysis
before submitting it to the prosecution.

702
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,511
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

703
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:54,142
I appreciate you taking the time
to meet with me like this.

704
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:56,978
It may be a case of too little, too late,

705
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,731
but I want to know exactly why and how

706
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:01,816
I lost my company.

707
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:04,068
You must be going through a lot.

708
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:05,653
But

709
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:09,532
how did that initial investment
from Bluestone come about?

710
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:12,368
Well…

711
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:26,633
First, I'd like to thank you
for your generous evaluation

712
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:29,218
of our technology
and your interest in investing in it.

713
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:55,995
Wait, are they suggesting
an absorptive merger?

714
00:40:56,496 --> 00:40:59,082
This isn't an investment.
They just want to steal the technology.

715
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:03,753
Our goal is to fully develop
this technology

716
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:07,966
to grow Hynic Core further
and eventually take it public.

717
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:11,594
We cannot accept those terms.

718
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:25,608
I knew this would happen.

719
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:27,485
All investment proposals so far

720
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:30,154
have included acquisition
and technology transfer conditions.

721
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:32,949
This only leaves us
with securities-based loans.

722
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:34,492
That's not an option for us.

723
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:37,120
If, by any chance, a default occurs,

724
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:40,623
the stock collateral could be liquidated.
We could lose the company.

725
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:41,624
He's right.

726
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:45,878
We need to find an investor
who doesn't require stock as collateral.

727
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:54,762
I might've been raised overseas,

728
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:57,890
but I still find
these cocktail parties awkward.

729
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:01,561
Sure. Right.

730
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,440
Let me introduce myself.

731
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:08,735
I'm Ban Gi-seung,
the CEO of Bluestone Fund.

732
00:42:08,818 --> 00:42:11,904
I see. It's nice to meet you.
I'm Lee Seong-bin.

733
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:13,531
Hello.

734
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:19,746
-Cheers.
-Sure.

735
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:21,164
Really?

736
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:23,708
You won't require stock
as collateral for investment?

737
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,460
Yes, that's right.

738
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:28,171
Bluestone Fund

739
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:32,258
is an asset management company
founded to support high-tech SMEs

740
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:33,259
and venture startups.

741
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:37,388
In simpler terms, we provide loans
based on confidence in the technology,

742
00:42:37,472 --> 00:42:39,140
without requiring collateral.

743
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:45,521
This is no place to discuss the details.
Why don't you stop by our office?

744
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:48,274
Yes, I definitely will do that.

745
00:42:49,442 --> 00:42:51,611
Back then, we were desperate
for research funding.

746
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:54,280
Yes, I remember that.

747
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:57,283
That's why you invested
your personal funds,

748
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:58,993
but insufficient legal formalities

749
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:02,789
in the process of recovering some of it
led to an embezzlement charge.

750
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:05,333
Back then, Ms. Kwon

751
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:09,712
attempted to provide you with legal advice
to prevent the charge from being upheld.

752
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:10,963
And she was demoted.

753
00:43:11,798 --> 00:43:12,673
Wait.

754
00:43:13,466 --> 00:43:15,259
That's why you were demoted?

755
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:17,595
Yes.

756
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:20,306
I'm certain there must have been

757
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:23,309
a harmful provision
in your contract with Bluestone.

758
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:25,353
I'm sure I was transferred far away

759
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:28,272
to prevent you from receiving
any legal advice regarding that clause.

760
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:30,191
Yes, that's quite likely.

761
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:33,569
She was in charge of Hynic Core,

762
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:36,197
but her access
to all information was revoked,

763
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,157
and she was taken off the case overnight.

764
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:41,244
That coincides with the time
Bluestone proposed that loan to you.

765
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:45,706
Now all the pieces are falling into place.

766
00:43:46,249 --> 00:43:48,292
Did you bring
your contract with Bluestone?

767
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:49,418
Yes.

768
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:53,214
Here you go.

769
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:55,216
I'll take a close look.

770
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:06,811
Hello?

771
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:10,648
Yes, that's me. How can I help you?

772
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:13,943
What?

773
00:44:14,527 --> 00:44:16,404
Someone impersonated me?

774
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:20,491
Okay. I'm on my way.

775
00:44:21,868 --> 00:44:23,119
Did something happen?

776
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:26,497
The police want me to come in
for questioning as a witness

777
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:28,541
in a fraud case
where someone impersonated me.

778
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:29,542
-What?
-What?

779
00:44:31,127 --> 00:44:34,046
Dr. Choi is scheduled to appear
before the prosecution this afternoon.

780
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:35,173
Yes.

781
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,550
I could end up being late,

782
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:39,802
so I'll let Mr. Yoon know before I leave.

783
00:44:39,886 --> 00:44:41,846
-Sure. Get going.
-Okay.

784
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:43,931
I hope it's nothing serious.

785
00:44:51,731 --> 00:44:53,482
Are they still questioning her?

786
00:44:55,735 --> 00:44:57,820
Shouldn't we go down to the station?

787
00:44:57,904 --> 00:44:59,071
She's just a witness.

788
00:44:59,155 --> 00:45:01,073
-You know something, don't you?
-No, I don't.

789
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:04,911
I think you do.
You two seem pretty close recently.

790
00:45:05,912 --> 00:45:07,538
Is there anything we can do to help?

791
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:12,335
We need to know what's going on
to come up with a plan.

792
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:16,005
I need to get going.

793
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:16,964
Where?

794
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:20,384
Dr. Choi is scheduled
to appear before the prosecution today.

795
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:22,845
Right. You're accompanying her
as legal counsel.

796
00:45:23,596 --> 00:45:24,764
Yeah.

797
00:45:28,601 --> 00:45:30,686
Did you hear from Ms. Choi?

798
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:31,896
Nothing yet.

799
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,565
-Let's take my car.
-Okay.

800
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:39,946
You can't reach her, right?

801
00:45:46,661 --> 00:45:49,622
I saw the opinion brief.
It was quite thorough.

802
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:51,749
Yes, all thanks to--

803
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:58,965
Dr. Choi Ji-su.

804
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:02,093
Did you intentionally kill
Mr. Kim Byeong-su?

805
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:05,096
No… I didn't.

806
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:07,431
All right.

807
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:09,892
You will not be indicted for murder.

808
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:11,894
Pardon?

809
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:15,856
The brief outlined very clearly
that you didn't kill Mr. Kim Byeong-su.

810
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:17,233
I see.

811
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:19,777
Since we had a dead prick on our hands,

812
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:24,031
we considered indicting for manslaughter
due to occupational negligence,

813
00:46:24,115 --> 00:46:25,992
but the autopsy concluded

814
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:29,912
that the cause of death
was aortic dissection,

815
00:46:29,996 --> 00:46:32,248
caused by vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,

816
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:33,916
an underlying condition.

817
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:36,836
Yes, we agree with that as well.

818
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:40,047
The brief includes the analysis
of a pathology expert.

819
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:41,757
Yes, I reviewed that.

820
00:46:42,383 --> 00:46:46,095
After reviewing the autopsy results
and the submitted opinion brief,

821
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,015
we have concluded there was

822
00:46:49,098 --> 00:46:52,143
no direct causal link
between the emergency care and death.

823
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:58,065
Dr. Choi Ji-su.

824
00:46:59,984 --> 00:47:02,570
We have decided not to pursue
indictment in this case.

825
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:05,531
Really?

826
00:47:06,157 --> 00:47:09,035
Yes. This investigation is closed.
You may leave.

827
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:13,247
Thank you for taking the time
to come all the way here today.

828
00:47:13,748 --> 00:47:14,874
Get back safely.

829
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:17,585
Yes. Thank you.

830
00:47:28,429 --> 00:47:30,931
Is it all over now?

831
00:47:31,724 --> 00:47:32,600
Yes.

832
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:36,145
They decided on non-indictment,
so this concludes the case.

833
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:37,730
Thank goodness.

834
00:47:38,314 --> 00:47:40,941
Thank you so much, both of you.

835
00:47:41,025 --> 00:47:42,735
Thank you for working so hard.

836
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:45,738
You can stop worrying now.
Get plenty of rest.

837
00:47:46,364 --> 00:47:48,407
Okay. Thank you.

838
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:57,792
They decided not to indict.

839
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:01,879
We did work hard on the opinion brief,

840
00:48:02,463 --> 00:48:05,257
but I wasn't expecting them
to decide against indictment.

841
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:07,343
CHOI HO-YEON

842
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:09,553
It's Ms. Choi.

843
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:11,097
Hello?

844
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:12,890
What happened?

845
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:16,477
Oh, really?

846
00:48:18,521 --> 00:48:19,480
All right.

847
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:21,982
It's okay.

848
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:25,152
Don't worry. Okay, bye.

849
00:48:27,947 --> 00:48:28,906
What did she say?

850
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:32,785
She's still being questioned.
Some sort of misunderstanding.

851
00:48:33,661 --> 00:48:34,537
I see.

852
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:37,206
I think I need to head to Ms. Choi's.

853
00:48:38,374 --> 00:48:39,250
Why?

854
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:41,794
The kids are on break,
and her aunt is away.

855
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:43,879
I guess they've been home alone all day.

856
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:47,133
She mentioned she wasn't sure
if they had a proper meal yet.

857
00:48:47,216 --> 00:48:48,926
Did she say they were seven?

858
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:49,927
Yes.

859
00:48:50,803 --> 00:48:51,720
And their parents?

860
00:48:51,804 --> 00:48:55,599
It seemed like Ms. Choi
is taking care of them on her own.

861
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:58,310
She did say her aunt lives nearby
and helps out.

862
00:48:58,394 --> 00:48:59,437
Tell me her address.

863
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:02,314
If you just drop me off here,
I can take a cab.

864
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:05,901
They must be hungry. Take this car.
Don't make them wait longer.

865
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:25,087
I think we're almost there.

866
00:49:25,171 --> 00:49:28,674
Yes, we are.
But you have to take the stairs from here.

867
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:30,843
This is as far as we can go by car.

868
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:35,055
Okay. We'll get out here,
and please wait for us nearby.

869
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:36,140
You're coming too?

870
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:37,600
Yes.

871
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:39,185
-You don't have to--
-Let's go.

872
00:50:00,164 --> 00:50:01,373
Who is it?

873
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:03,667
I'm Choi Ho-yeon's…

874
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:06,337
I mean,

875
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:08,714
I'm your sister's friend.

876
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:11,842
Our sister doesn't have any friends.

877
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:13,719
Well,

878
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:16,972
I'm your sister's work friend.

879
00:50:17,056 --> 00:50:19,391
She's not home right now.

880
00:50:19,475 --> 00:50:21,393
Don't tell her that.

881
00:50:21,477 --> 00:50:25,856
She told us not to tell strangers
if there were no adults at home.

882
00:50:26,482 --> 00:50:30,361
Our sister just stepped out,

883
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,613
but she's nearby.

884
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:35,157
No, I'm here because

885
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:37,368
she told me
she was going to be a bit late

886
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:39,995
and she asked me to look after you girls.

887
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:42,164
I'm here because your sister asked me to.

888
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:44,750
Give us the password.

889
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:45,834
Chocolate milk.

890
00:50:47,962 --> 00:50:48,921
What was that?

891
00:50:49,505 --> 00:50:51,507
Ms. Choi told me earlier.

892
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,717
She said the kids might ask.

893
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:56,303
Chocolate milk.

894
00:51:02,643 --> 00:51:03,644
Hello.

895
00:51:05,104 --> 00:51:07,648
Is he my sister's friend too?

896
00:51:08,816 --> 00:51:09,817
No.

897
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,527
He's not a friend.

898
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:14,280
He's actually her boss.

899
00:51:14,363 --> 00:51:15,614
I see.

900
00:51:15,698 --> 00:51:18,617
You must be that scary Boss Man.

901
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:21,579
I was never scary.

902
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:26,125
What are your names?

903
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,085
I'm Choi Mi-yeon.

904
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:30,588
-She's my younger sister.
-Choi Seo-yeon.

905
00:51:30,671 --> 00:51:31,880
Have you eaten anything?

906
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:35,718
-You must be hungry.
-What do you want to eat?

907
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:37,052
-Pizza.
-Stir-fried rice cake.

908
00:51:37,136 --> 00:51:38,304
-Fried chicken.
-Spaghetti.

909
00:51:38,387 --> 00:51:39,597
Grilled ribs.

910
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,015
We can't have that.

911
00:51:41,557 --> 00:51:44,518
Ho-yeon said we can have grilled ribs

912
00:51:45,144 --> 00:51:47,646
only once a year during Chuseok.

913
00:51:48,731 --> 00:51:51,900
Then how about we go out
for dinner today?

914
00:51:51,984 --> 00:51:53,068
-Yes!
-Yes!

915
00:51:54,987 --> 00:51:56,030
Let's go.

916
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:57,364
-Let's go.
-Come on.

917
00:52:12,504 --> 00:52:13,464
This place is good.

918
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:15,299
This place is the real deal.

919
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:17,259
You like it?

920
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:19,887
It's so good.

921
00:52:22,014 --> 00:52:23,599
Eat up, you two.

922
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,812
What's wrong? Have some more.

923
00:52:28,896 --> 00:52:30,064
I'm full.

924
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:32,024
What? Already?

925
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:39,823
I'm done eating too.

926
00:52:39,907 --> 00:52:41,659
Why? Have some more.

927
00:52:41,742 --> 00:52:43,118
No, thanks.

928
00:52:43,202 --> 00:52:44,536
But…

929
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:49,750
can we bring
the leftover pork cutlets home?

930
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:52,294
Why?

931
00:52:52,378 --> 00:52:55,255
Ho-yeon likes pork cutlets too.

932
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:59,843
Last time we were here,
she pretended to have a stomachache

933
00:52:59,927 --> 00:53:03,389
so that we could eat
as much as we wanted.

934
00:53:03,472 --> 00:53:07,518
I knew she was pretending,

935
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:10,354
but it was so good,

936
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:12,940
I ended up finishing it by myself.

937
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:18,153
You can finish yours,
and we can order some more to go.

938
00:53:18,237 --> 00:53:20,656
-Can we really?
-Of course.

939
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:23,909
I'll be sure to buy your sister
lots of tasty food at work.

940
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:25,536
Wow, really?

941
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:27,246
-Yeah.
-Promise.

942
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:28,622
Me too.

943
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:30,249
Sure. I promise.

944
00:53:30,791 --> 00:53:32,543
Sign it.

945
00:53:34,837 --> 00:53:36,547
I wish someone else were here to see this.

946
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:39,299
It's like your eyes
are shooting out hearts right now.

947
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:41,927
How did you hide this side of you
for so long?

948
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:53,897
Just put whatever you want in the cart.

949
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:01,321
Meal kits would be best
for the kids, right?

950
00:54:01,405 --> 00:54:04,158
Yes, we should get
some side dishes as well.

951
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:05,117
Okay.

952
00:54:14,543 --> 00:54:17,337
Make sure to eat well
even when your sister's not home.

953
00:54:17,421 --> 00:54:21,467
-You know how to make this, right?
-Yes, two minutes in the microwave.

954
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:23,135
Four minutes for two of them.

955
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:26,555
Right. You can have it
with the side dishes.

956
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:29,057
And portion out the side dishes,
even if it's a hassle.

957
00:54:29,141 --> 00:54:30,058
-Okay.
-Okay.

958
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:33,437
Here.

959
00:54:35,147 --> 00:54:37,149
Ms. Choi is running a bit late.

960
00:54:37,775 --> 00:54:39,193
Yes, she is.

961
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:42,279
I'm heading out now.
I trust you'll put them to bed.

962
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:44,364
-Okay.
-I'm leaving.

963
00:54:57,002 --> 00:55:00,214
Stay strong and take care.
Don't forget to listen to your sister.

964
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:02,883
Don't leave.

965
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:05,385
Just stay a bit longer.

966
00:55:06,887 --> 00:55:09,681
Why don't you leave
after they've gone to bed?

967
00:55:18,816 --> 00:55:20,442
I guess we grew on them already.

968
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:24,112
They're hungry for affection.

969
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:29,827
They're like little angels.

970
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:34,039
They're seven, but they're still babies.

971
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:37,960
Kim Byeong-su doesn't deserve

972
00:55:39,086 --> 00:55:41,129
to be forgiven, even in death.

973
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:48,011
The non-indictment decision today…

974
00:55:48,804 --> 00:55:50,931
It was the outcome I was hoping for,

975
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:54,935
but we prepared for a battle
and won before it ever started.

976
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:57,187
It's cathartic and all,

977
00:55:57,771 --> 00:55:58,730
but the catharsis

978
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:02,442
feels a bit underwhelming.

979
00:56:03,819 --> 00:56:06,572
Do you think Dr. Choi was lucky?

980
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:10,909
Do you think it was luck?

981
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:20,586
No.

982
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,171
I don't think it was luck.

983
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:29,052
I've assigned the Kim Byeong-su case
to you, Prosecutor Kwon.

984
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:32,472
But he also handled
Kim Byeong-su's child sexual assault case.

985
00:56:33,974 --> 00:56:34,850
So?

986
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:36,435
What's the issue?

987
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:40,898
All those who made

988
00:56:40,981 --> 00:56:43,942
even the smallest gesture or decision
to bring about Choi Ji-su's acquittal

989
00:56:44,026 --> 00:56:45,777
had been quietly
debating the right to life

990
00:56:45,861 --> 00:56:48,947
through the trials taking place
in the hidden corners of their hearts.

991
00:56:49,031 --> 00:56:50,449
I will handle this case.

992
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:53,577
How can the same prosecutor
take on this case?

993
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:56,079
This is ridiculous.

994
00:56:56,163 --> 00:56:58,832
You will be so…

995
00:56:59,625 --> 00:57:02,210
-Biased.
-Right. Biased.

996
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:06,214
Prosecutors do not allow
their emotions to interfere with cases.

997
00:57:06,298 --> 00:57:08,300
We are guided solely
by the law and principles.

998
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:12,512
Unbelievable. Listen, Mister Prosecutor.

999
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:15,265
You're clearly on that wench's side.

1000
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:17,434
Watch your words.

1001
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:19,394
If you want to throw a tantrum,

1002
00:57:19,478 --> 00:57:21,688
pick the right time
and the right audience.

1003
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:25,400
There was one driving force
behind their secret trials.

1004
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:28,445
It was love for the victim, Min-sol.

1005
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:31,782
Please make sure
she gets charged with murder.

1006
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:33,992
All right. I understand.

1007
00:57:34,076 --> 00:57:37,120
I think Mr. Kim Do-yeon
would be perfect for this case.

1008
00:57:37,204 --> 00:57:38,956
I'll have him handle your case.

1009
00:57:39,665 --> 00:57:41,708
He's good, right?

1010
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:45,671
Born from the regret and sense
of responsibility of the adults who failed

1011
00:57:45,754 --> 00:57:49,424
to protect the children who deserved
to grow up with love and care.

1012
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,301
A sort of belated love.

1013
00:57:51,385 --> 00:57:55,305
I never thought I'd see the day
Mr. Kim got assigned a case.

1014
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:58,225
He can't do nothing forever
just because he's incompetent and lazy.

1015
00:57:58,308 --> 00:57:59,685
But what if he fails miserably?

1016
00:57:59,768 --> 00:58:02,229
You heard them.
The victim was Kim Byeong-su.

1017
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:07,776
And their rulings
were fueled by rage at the one

1018
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:10,112
who destroyed that child's life.

1019
00:58:10,946 --> 00:58:12,614
Once family medical history is confirmed,

1020
00:58:12,698 --> 00:58:15,200
his underlying condition
can be concluded as the cause of death.

1021
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:19,162
It didn't matter if Kim Byeong-su's death
was intentional or accidental.

1022
00:58:19,246 --> 00:58:20,747
What mattered to them

1023
00:58:21,248 --> 00:58:25,711
was the fact that his existence
remained an open wound for Min-sol.

1024
00:58:27,546 --> 00:58:31,883
I know we have to work hard to ensure
that no wrongful death is overlooked,

1025
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:34,094
but it almost feels like

1026
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:36,555
you're all working especially hard
on this case.

1027
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:39,766
Do you know whose autopsy this is?

1028
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:42,102
-No.
-It's Kim Byeong-su.

1029
00:58:42,978 --> 00:58:44,146
We need to work hard.

1030
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:45,647
Yes, we do.

1031
00:58:45,731 --> 00:58:46,940
And in the end,

1032
00:58:47,441 --> 00:58:49,109
that sentiment became an earnest plea

1033
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:51,486
for the acquittal of the one
who may have taken his life.

1034
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:55,240
Was Dr. Choi also aware
of Kim Byeong-su's underlying condition?

1035
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:56,199
No.

1036
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:59,536
Dr. Choi refused to treat him at the time.

1037
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:02,164
She never had a chance
to check Kim Byeong-su's condition.

1038
00:59:03,331 --> 00:59:04,624
That makes sense.

1039
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,961
If she had, she could be indicted
for negligent manslaughter

1040
00:59:08,045 --> 00:59:10,964
or even murder in the worst-case scenario.

1041
00:59:11,048 --> 00:59:11,923
Right.

1042
00:59:14,301 --> 00:59:17,054
There's a very good chance
the prosecution

1043
00:59:17,137 --> 00:59:19,681
and the opposing counsel
will ask you the same question.

1044
00:59:19,765 --> 00:59:20,849
I'll keep that in mind.

1045
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:22,559
All right.

1046
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:24,853
-Pardon?
-You didn't know.

1047
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:28,440
You never had a chance
to examine Kim Byeong-su. Right?

1048
00:59:30,317 --> 00:59:33,070
That's how I'll answer if anyone asks me.

1049
00:59:33,153 --> 00:59:34,154
Because that's the truth.

1050
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:41,870
I also have two daughters.

1051
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:45,123
I knew that he had
an underlying condition five years ago,

1052
00:59:45,207 --> 00:59:46,833
but I didn't tell him.

1053
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:51,671
I just wanted fate
to have its way with him.

1054
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:59,930
You know such disclosure before indictment
is at our discretion, right?

1055
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:00,889
Yes.

1056
01:00:01,848 --> 01:00:03,475
We would really appreciate it.

1057
01:00:06,228 --> 01:00:07,187
I'll think about it.

1058
01:00:08,814 --> 01:00:10,107
Thank you.

1059
01:00:12,984 --> 01:00:15,028
Why are you in such a hurry to leave?

1060
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:26,748
I didn't say I'd think about it for long.

1061
01:00:26,832 --> 01:00:29,501
I assume you know
how to submit a request for access.

1062
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:32,754
Of course.

1063
01:00:32,838 --> 01:00:34,589
Then submit a request today.

1064
01:00:34,673 --> 01:00:35,799
Okay.

1065
01:00:38,385 --> 01:00:41,805
Where did that insightful book

1066
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:44,558
about Ehlers-Danlos syndrome go?

1067
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:48,562
Here it is.

1068
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,607
In the end, his death…

1069
01:00:52,691 --> 01:00:53,942
SYMPTOM-BASED VASCULAR EDS

1070
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:57,821
…simply brought a little justice
into the world.

1071
01:00:58,405 --> 01:00:59,614
Do you think

1072
01:01:00,448 --> 01:01:03,034
humans have a right to life?

1073
01:01:03,785 --> 01:01:05,120
Yes, I do.

1074
01:01:07,289 --> 01:01:08,790
I believe that right

1075
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:13,295
is determined by the marks
we make on the lives of others.

1076
01:01:14,546 --> 01:01:16,047
If that mark

1077
01:01:17,591 --> 01:01:19,467
only contains suffering and despair,

1078
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:23,972
I think you lose the right to life.

1079
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:26,308
And if someone who lost that right dies,

1080
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:29,186
their death is no longer a tragedy.

1081
01:01:30,061 --> 01:01:33,440
It just becomes another piece
that keeps the world in balance.

1082
01:01:34,065 --> 01:01:36,651
How twisted must his life have been

1083
01:01:36,735 --> 01:01:38,153
for people

1084
01:01:39,613 --> 01:01:43,366
to seek justice even after his death?

1085
01:01:46,036 --> 01:01:49,372
Hamjji is on my side.

1086
01:01:50,498 --> 01:01:52,125
No.

1087
01:01:52,209 --> 01:01:54,336
Hamjji

1088
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:57,464
is on my side.

1089
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:05,055
You're smiling again.

1090
01:02:59,484 --> 01:03:02,779
BEYOND THE BAR

1091
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:06,866
Ms. Kang Hyo-min is here.

1092
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:08,702
Have we met before?

1093
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:10,161
I knew you wouldn't remember me.

1094
01:03:10,245 --> 01:03:11,538
PTSD?

1095
01:03:13,415 --> 01:03:15,041
I was a victim of severe school bullying.

1096
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:17,335
But do you think Mr. Ko
really planned all this?

1097
01:03:17,419 --> 01:03:19,462
There's no way
he would've left any evidence.

1098
01:03:19,546 --> 01:03:21,923
I might just have the answer.

1099
01:03:22,841 --> 01:03:26,052
How dare you represent
the murderer who killed my daughter?

1100
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:27,887
I'm going to do my best.

1101
01:03:27,971 --> 01:03:29,764
Now it's time to find the final blow.

1102
01:03:29,848 --> 01:03:30,765
This is it.

1103
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:37,061
