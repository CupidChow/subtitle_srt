00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:35,953
BEYOND THE BAR

2
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:40,749
Hyo-min.

3
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:42,751
Please open this door.

4
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:44,753
Why are you doing this to me?

5
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:46,421
<i>A girl</i>

6
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:48,632
<i>- discovered a butterfly cocoon…</i>
- Hyo-min.

7
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:51,260
<i>…and looked after it with much care.</i>

8
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:54,846
Talk to me, Hyo-min.

9
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,849
<i>- Then, one day…</i>
- Please, Hyo-min…

10
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:01,603
<i>…the butterfly inside the cocoon</i>
<i>tried with all its might to break free.</i>

11
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:08,485
<i>The girl watched with sympathy.</i>

12
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:15,242
<i>After painfully struggling for half a day,</i>
<i>the butterfly managed</i>

13
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:20,247
<i>to free half of its body from the cocoon</i>
<i>and remained still, seemingly resting.</i>

14
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:24,626
<i>It looked as if it did not have</i>
<i>the strength to continue.</i>

15
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:30,299
<i>Unable to bear it any longer,</i>
<i>she made a small incision on the cocoon.</i>

16
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:35,846
<i>When she did,</i>
<i>the butterfly was completely freed,</i>

17
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,889
<i>and it proceeded to flutter its wings.</i>

18
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:42,561
<i>It looked as if it was ready</i>
<i>to soar into the sky.</i>

19
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:13,342
<i>However,</i>

20
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:17,179
<i>the butterfly merely circled in midair</i>
<i>before dropping to the ground,</i>

21
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:19,723
<i>without ever reaching the ceiling.</i>

22
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:22,726
<i>- And there…</i>
- Let's talk this out.

23
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:26,355
<i>- …both its fluttering and its life…</i>
- Hyo-min.

24
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:28,148
<i>…came to an end.</i>

25
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:30,651
<i>It's psychogenic dyslexia.</i>

26
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,320
It could be a conversion disorder

27
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,489
or a stress-induced cognitive impairment.

28
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:36,615
Pardon?

29
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,326
What do you mean…

30
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:42,287
Prolonged academic stress
and mental overload have led

31
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,748
to a temporary decline
in the brain's ability

32
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,500
to process visual information.

33
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:50,045
My child was in a gifted program
and even skipped two grades.

34
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:51,963
People refer to her as a genius.

35
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:56,843
This type of acquired dyslexia

36
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:00,389
typically develops as a result

37
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:03,392
of severe pressure and stress,
regardless of intellectual abilities…

38
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:07,562
<i>With the dead butterfly in her hands,</i>

39
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:09,064
<i>the girl started crying.</i>

40
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:14,277
<i>A butterfly must twist its whole body</i>
<i>and push against the cocoon</i>

41
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:17,572
<i>to make its body grow lighter</i>

42
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:19,616
<i>and its wings stronger.</i>

43
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:22,494
<i>The girl did not realize that butterflies</i>

44
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:26,915
<i>that do not undergo that process</i>
<i>are ultimately unable to take flight.</i>

45
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:31,878
BUTTERFLY CHRYSALIS

46
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,553
I'm so tired today.

47
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:40,679
Did you sleep well?

48
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,848
- I slept a bit.
- I slept well.

49
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:43,890
You can order more meat.

50
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:46,727
Deok-ho.

51
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:48,770
Try this.

52
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:50,605
- I already have some.
- Just try it.

53
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:51,732
Go on.

54
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:53,483
What's so special about it?

55
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,944
HANUN EXPRESS

56
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:57,404
It has quite a unique taste.

57
00:03:57,487 --> 00:04:00,282
Have you ever heard of "Irish coffee"?

58
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:01,533
What's that?

59
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,664
It is tasty.

60
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:09,416
I need to go.

61
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:10,917
Take this for me.

62
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:11,960
- See you.
- Bye.

63
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:13,003
Take it easy.

64
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,590
- But what's an Irish coffee?
- Well…

65
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,676
My daughter bought it for me
at this fancy place last time.

66
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,345
It's coffee with whiskey.
It tastes amazing.

67
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,891
I figured, "Why not?" So I tried
adding alcohol to instant coffee.

68
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,434
I think it tastes pretty similar.

69
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:29,186
Really?

70
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,562
Make me a cup too.

71
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:04,346
Good lord.

72
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,768
HANUN EXPRESS

73
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:13,647
Are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere?

74
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,774
Min-guk…

75
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:18,235
How?

76
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:21,154
- How could you?
- My apologies, ma'am.

77
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:24,157
My goodness, Min-guk. Are you all right?

78
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,911
- What do I do?
- Oh no…

79
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,746
- Hello?
- How could you?

80
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,706
- How?
- I…

81
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,376
- I hit a child.
- What do I do?

82
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:37,546
My goodness. Are you okay?
Are you hurt anywhere?

83
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,728
Goodness, you've been drinking.

84
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:55,981
Pardon?

85
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:57,983
What do you mean…

86
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,028
You are being arrested
for driving under the influence.

87
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:03,405
I didn't drink.

88
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,532
You have the right to remain silent.

89
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,118
- You may request a habeas corpus review--
- I didn't drink.

90
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,619
Sure. Let's go to the station first.

91
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,454
- I really didn't!
- Let's go to the station.

92
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,206
- Let me try again!
- Please stay still.

93
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,541
- I didn't drink.
- Stay still.

94
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,001
Come here. Come on.

95
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,009
Hold on, this is…

96
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,400
Doctor. Is my Min-guk okay?

97
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,363
It's a bit strange…

98
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:47,240
There are no external injuries.

99
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:49,701
No signs of bruises
or the collision at all.

100
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,202
What do you mean?

101
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:54,331
It doesn't seem like
Min-guk got hit by the truck.

102
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:56,708
Then why can't he use his legs--

103
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,461
There's no sign
of a collision with the delivery truck,

104
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,296
but a functional impairment

105
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,924
has developed in part
of his spinal nerve pathways.

106
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:09,304
Internal injuries like this are
usually caused by external trauma.

107
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:11,806
There are no signs of a collision,

108
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:15,268
but these are the same symptoms
you'd expect from a collision.

109
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:19,689
I just don't understand
what you're saying at all right now.

110
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,403
Hello?

111
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,489
Yes, that's right.

112
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:32,494
Pardon?

113
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,000
Doctor.

114
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:42,921
They checked the security footage,
and it showed…

115
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,257
that the truck

116
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,677
did not hit Min-guk.

117
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,261
Pardon?

118
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:52,222
Wait, if he wasn't hit, then why…

119
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:56,351
Why can't he move his legs?

120
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:59,938
What are we going to do? My poor Min-guk…

121
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:05,902
What do we do now, Doctor? Tell me.

122
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,905
What should we do now?

123
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:13,034
Hold on, let's clarify.
Was he hit by the truck or not?

124
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:16,788
He wasn't hit,
but he's injured as if he had been…

125
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:19,708
What are you saying?

126
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:23,795
Mr. Lee, can we get some clarity?

127
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,256
Yes, sir.
So, the plaintiff's doctor claims

128
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,508
the plaintiff shows symptoms
consistent with a collision,

129
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:29,467
despite the fact…

130
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:30,510
PHYSICIAN'S STATEMENT

131
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:33,388
…that the delivery truck in question
made no physical contact.

132
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:36,182
No collision, but the injuries
are consistent with one?

133
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:37,308
Is that even possible?

134
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,644
I'm not sure. That's what it says.

135
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,400
Let's get a psychiatrist's opinion first.

136
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,068
Schedule a consultation with Dr. Yeon.

137
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:48,445
Yes, sir.

138
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,613
- And who's representing the plaintiff?
- Lee & Seo.

139
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:54,242
This isn't a major case, though.

140
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:55,994
It seems they received
a hefty retainer fee.

141
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,746
The settlement won't be that high.

142
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:00,415
The plaintiff's family is wealthy,
so money won't be the issue.

143
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,542
It appears the mother is a bit intense.

144
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,502
Since her child was left disabled,

145
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:07,756
she wants to send the deliveryman to jail
and bankrupt the delivery company.

146
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,799
She was yelling and throwing a fit.

147
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:15,472
Ms. Kang, you'll accompany me
to the consultation with Dr. Yeon.

148
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,765
Yes, sir.

149
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:25,815
Hey. What's up?

150
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,109
He only spoke the truth.

151
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:30,361
Come on, Father.

152
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:33,490
What? What do you want me to do about it?

153
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,950
Come on now…

154
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,452
Listen, Tae-seop.

155
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,370
Yes?

156
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,998
I was the one who changed
all your dirty diapers.

157
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,958
"Dirty"? What?

158
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:46,336
Your mom and that nanny
said they would do it,

159
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,046
but I insisted on doing it myself.

160
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,423
Do you know why?

161
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,218
Because you love me?

162
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,097
Because it'd only last a year or two.

163
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,306
Right.

164
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:03,770
But it feels like I'm still changing
your dirty diapers even now…

165
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,188
That's not what's happening here.

166
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,440
Yoon Seok-hoon, he…

167
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:10,693
All right. I hear you. So…

168
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:12,904
Jeez.

169
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,741
Have Mr. Yoon come to my office.

170
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:19,702
Get away from me.

171
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:31,756
I'll head out now.

172
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:39,764
Take a seat.

173
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,150
I asked to see you because…

174
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:04,372
It's a civil and criminal case,
and we're representing the defendant.

175
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:08,501
The plaintiff is a five-year-old child,
and he was almost hit by a delivery truck.

176
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:11,963
It was a close call,
but luckily, there was no collision.

177
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,215
However, part of his spinal nerve pathways

178
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:16,009
developed a functional impairment,

179
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:19,137
so his mother filed
a civil and criminal lawsuit

180
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,222
against the delivery company and driver.

181
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,683
They say the child's symptoms

182
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:26,811
are consistent with those
of a car crash victim.

183
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,523
Is this medically possible?

184
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,235
Yes, it is possible.

185
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:38,698
It seems the child mistakenly believes
he was hit by the truck.

186
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:39,991
He believes it?

187
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,659
Yes, it appears his strong belief

188
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,786
has led to physical symptoms.

189
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:48,917
When an extreme psychological reaction
manifests itself as physical symptoms,

190
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,002
we refer to it as a conversion disorder.

191
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:55,715
Along with that,
the nocebo effect likely played a role.

192
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,554
Most people know about the placebo effect,

193
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:04,599
where someone is healed
even after taking inert medication.

194
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,935
But the opposite effect also exists.

195
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:10,271
The nocebo effect occurs
when psychological fear or belief

196
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:13,483
causes a real negative physical effect.

197
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:19,781
In fact, in 1950,
there was a case involving a patient

198
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:22,075
<i>on a ship transporting wine</i>
<i>from Lisbon to the UK.</i>

199
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:25,995
<i>The cargo ship was</i>
<i>on its way back to Lisbon</i>

200
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,206
<i>after unloading all the wine at a UK port.</i>

201
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,166
<i>Meanwhile, one of the crew members</i>

202
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,920
<i>got trapped in one</i>
<i>of the refrigerated shipping containers</i>

203
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,130
<i>and froze to death.</i>

204
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:40,510
That makes sense.
He was trapped in there for a long time.

205
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:45,181
As he was dying, he used a metal shard

206
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,308
<i>to write something on the freezer wall.</i>

207
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:48,268
THE COLD…

208
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:53,022
<i>He wrote, "At first, the cold froze</i>
<i>my nose, fingers, and toes."</i>

209
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:57,527
<i>"As time passed, the freezing spread."</i>

210
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,195
<i>After some time, he wrote,</i>

211
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,991
<i>"Now I don't even feel the cold anymore,"</i>
<i>before dying.</i>

212
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,368
<i>However, what's surprising</i>

213
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:08,079
is that without any wine
left in the freezer,

214
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:10,248
they had turned it off,
and the temperature inside

215
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,916
remained at 18 degrees.

216
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,211
It was certainly not cold enough
for someone to freeze to death.

217
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:16,170
However, that man

218
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:19,173
suffered all the symptoms
of freezing to death,

219
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:21,342
before "freezing to death" himself.

220
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:25,138
"I am locked in a freezer,
and I will end up freezing to death."

221
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,224
That thought led him to his death.

222
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,602
That's amazing.

223
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:44,782
We confirmed that it was
medically possible.

224
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:46,117
Where do we go from here?

225
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,078
For now, check
the security footage of the accident

226
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:50,955
and talk to the witnesses.

227
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:51,998
All right.

228
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,501
The boy just jumped out of nowhere.

229
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:59,172
I watched in horror as it happened.

230
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:02,467
Luckily, the truck stopped
just in the nick of time.

231
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,428
I was incredibly relieved.

232
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:08,556
But the boy collapsed
to the ground as if he were injured.

233
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:14,312
That day, that boy's mother
frantically screamed her lungs out.

234
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:17,023
So just based on her reaction, I thought,

235
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:20,443
"Oh, that kid must have been crushed
to death by the truck."

236
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,987
Really? How did she react?

237
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:26,574
She was bawling her eyes out,
so I went up to her and said,

238
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:29,452
"I don't think the truck hit him."

239
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,705
The kid looked perfectly fine. No blood.

240
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:36,834
But then suddenly,
the kid couldn't move his legs

241
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:39,003
and seemed to be in so much pain.

242
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:42,215
So then, we all assumed
the truck had hit him.

243
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,175
I see…

244
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,986
Goodness me. Wake up. Get up.

245
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,279
- Sorry.
- Morning, sir!

246
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:14,288
Hey.

247
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:15,832
Hey, Hyo-min!

248
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,209
Kang Hyo-min, get up already.
We're late for our meeting.

249
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,752
What?

250
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,295
The meeting with Mr. Yoon.

251
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:22,964
- Meeting?
- Hurry up. We're late.

252
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,715
- Hurry up.
- The meeting.

253
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,134
- What time does it start?
- What?

254
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:28,177
Just hurry up. Come on.

255
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,556
Let's go!

256
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,358
- My apologies.
- Why are you late?

257
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:43,401
Sorry.

258
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,319
Did you pull an all-nighter?

259
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,406
Are you growing a beard over there?

260
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:54,412
"Associates Who Leave Big Law Firms
in Search of Work-Life Balance."

261
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:57,123
"When work-life balance
outweighs pay cuts,

262
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,333
they seek out in-house counsel positions."

263
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,004
Out of all the articles to sleep on…

264
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:04,922
Did you sleep on a newspaper?

265
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:06,757
The print is stamped on your face.

266
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,762
The other side.

267
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,389
Here?

268
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,142
Wipe it off.

269
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,065
Just wash your whole face
while you're at it.

270
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:29,780
Thank you.

271
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,345
But why an all-nighter?

272
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,096
I didn't give you that much work.

273
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:59,810
Mr. Hong gave us an assignment.

274
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:03,940
I saw his associates go home
right on time for the past two days.

275
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,024
What's the assignment?

276
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,609
Basically hard labor.

277
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:12,448
He told us to organize ten years' worth
of corporate due diligence data.

278
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,408
Why didn't you tell me?

279
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:17,286
He said it was Mr. Ko's case,
so it was important…

280
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,664
There's also what happened last time.

281
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,958
We didn't want to cause more conflict…

282
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:23,918
But…

283
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:28,339
Mr. Ko's M&A case closed last week.

284
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:29,590
- What?
- Pardon?

285
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,552
Sounds like this was revenge.

286
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:41,060
Let's start the meeting.

287
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,395
Yes, sir.

288
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,188
- Yes.
- Yes, sir.

289
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:46,315
Seriously?

290
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,777
HANUN EXPRESS

291
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:51,612
The nocebo effect…

292
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:54,407
I'd only heard about it,
but I guess it's real.

293
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,950
If it really is a nocebo effect,

294
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:59,370
then Min-guk's mental misperception
is to blame for his physical symptoms.

295
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,372
The misbelief that the truck hit him.

296
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:04,834
That false belief triggered
physical symptoms.

297
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:06,627
Right.

298
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:08,838
If you watch
the security footage of the accident,

299
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,340
Min-guk's mom believed the truck hit him.

300
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,634
<i>The brakes screeched loudly,</i>

301
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:15,803
<i>and Min-guk was on the ground</i>
<i>in front of the truck.</i>

302
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,263
<i>She ran over in sheer panic,</i>

303
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,889
thinking he'd been hit and hurt badly.

304
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:20,141
She must have.

305
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:23,811
He would've been hurt quite badly
if he had been hit by a truck that big.

306
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:24,895
But…

307
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:28,232
<i>Min-guk was also paying attention</i>
<i>to his mother's reaction.</i>

308
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:31,569
<i>Min-guk's mother was</i>
<i>in total panic because she believed</i>

309
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,613
Min-guk was hit by the truck.

310
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,532
And as he watched
his mother react that way--

311
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:39,285
He mistakenly believed
he was hit by the truck?

312
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:40,870
If such a false belief

313
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,914
is to blame for his physical symptoms…

314
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:47,877
Establishing a causal link
between the threat of collision

315
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,920
and Min-guk's physical symptoms
will be difficult.

316
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:51,172
Yes.

317
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,299
The human mind is mysterious.

318
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:57,511
We do not know what caused
such a physical response.

319
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:00,139
Whether it was the threat of collision…

320
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,017
Or his mother's overreaction.

321
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:05,770
Right.

322
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,273
- Wow…
- Wow…

323
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,233
Kang Hyo-min.

324
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:13,861
As expected, you're amazing, Mr. Yoon.

325
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,446
Wow…

326
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,871
Mr. Yoon, are you just going
to let Mr. Hong get away with it?

327
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:25,831
Really? Come on, bro.

328
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:32,296
Hey, Mr. Yoon.

329
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,256
We should make our greetings audible.

330
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:36,801
Hey, Yoon Seok-hoon!

331
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,100
Did you not have a meeting with Mr. Ko?

332
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,518
I did.

333
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:46,894
And this is how you act?

334
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:49,063
I'm a bit busy.

335
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,233
Why that…

336
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:53,609
That little…

337
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,029
Tae-seop.

338
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,281
Mr. Ko <i>did</i> give him a warning, right?

339
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:01,075
Probably.

340
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,411
Jeez. He's so obnoxious.

341
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:05,079
Damn, that startled me.

342
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,998
Did he tattle to his dad? So petty.

343
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:10,584
Bro, did Mr. Ko give you an earful?

344
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:12,795
That's why you're
putting up with Mr. Hong?

345
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,213
That's not it.

346
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:18,551
The associates have been buzzing
since that incident last time,

347
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,803
saying Ms. Kwon
was pushed out by Ko Tae-seop

348
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,764
to be dispatched
as a small business in-house counsel.

349
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:25,057
Let's be honest, the only thing

350
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:27,852
Tae-seop has working for him
is that his father is a Yullim founder.

351
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:31,397
But the great Ms. Kwon
was demoted in one swift swoop.

352
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,108
Mr. Ko can pretend
to be fair all he wants.

353
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:36,777
In the end, he puts his family first.

354
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,237
That's the situation…

355
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:57,423
Wow.

356
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,467
What is this scent?

357
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:01,802
It smells so good.

358
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:04,430
MR. HONG DO-YUN

359
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:14,023
Hello?

360
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:17,610
Right now?

361
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:21,113
Sure. All right.

362
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,955
<i>I asked to see you because…</i>

363
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:34,126
Well, I'm only getting older.

364
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:38,005
I plan to retire soon
and stay on as an advisor.

365
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:42,843
I feel like I should first pass on
my managing partner title to someone.

366
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:48,849
I was wondering if you would be
interested in filling that position.

367
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:52,603
Are you surprised?

368
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,443
Mr. Yoon Seok-hoon.

369
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,863
Will you become
a managing partner of Yullim?

370
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,000
I appreciate the offer,

371
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:18,629
but I will have to decline.

372
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:20,673
What…

373
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:21,632
May I ask why?

374
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,844
Becoming the first managing partner
in his thirties

375
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:26,679
at one of the top five law firms

376
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:30,140
should guarantee a nomination
from any political party of your choosing.

377
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:31,684
I'm sorry, but I'm not interested.

378
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:39,567
Please feel free to share
if there is something holding you back.

379
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:47,491
I have no desire to become
the captain of a sinking ship.

380
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:48,492
"A sinking ship"?

381
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:55,708
You must be aware that Yullim ranked first
in second-half revenue last year.

382
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,502
We surpassed Lee & Seo.

383
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:00,963
It's a false dawn.

384
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,133
"A false dawn"?

385
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:07,970
And what makes you think that?

386
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:11,098
The three named partners
are the rainmakers of Yullim.

387
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,726
Your connections facilitate
client acquisition.

388
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:15,811
Your connections

389
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:19,148
are executives and CEOs
at major corporations and financial firms,

390
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,442
allowing you to maintain Yullim's revenue,

391
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,402
but they're like setting suns.

392
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,404
And Yullim is setting along with them.

393
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:28,449
On the other hand,
Lee & Seo, Daeyeong, and Yang & Kim

394
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:31,660
focused on honing their brands
and expertise to attract clients.

395
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:33,996
So even when a named partner
begins to fade,

396
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,248
the firm retains its corporate integrity.

397
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:39,585
Well, yes. I concur.

398
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,086
"A false dawn."

399
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:44,632
But don't you think

400
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:47,718
we have enough time to restructure
before it sets for good?

401
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:50,512
Then someone's going
to have to make heads roll.

402
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:54,266
Old guards who sit on their hands
with no client appeal,

403
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:58,062
partners with no real expertise
who bring in low-value cases

404
00:23:58,145 --> 00:23:59,605
through backroom schmoozing,

405
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:03,943
and the inept parasitic associates
who were hired to maintain connections

406
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:08,238
will all need to go
if we're going to restructure.

407
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:13,202
It appears you're looking
for an executioner,

408
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:16,664
but I have no intention
of becoming your hatchet man.

409
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:22,503
I can't become the executioner
for your sake…

410
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,804
I am a partner lawyer!

411
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,890
Are you kidding me right now?

412
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,309
Don't you know who I am?

413
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:42,147
How dare a newbie still wet
behind the ears talk to me like that?

414
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:46,151
What's the matter?

415
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:47,778
Tell him exactly what you told me.

416
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,197
What's wrong? What's going on?

417
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,199
He asked me for help with an op-ed,

418
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:55,077
so I told him I'd look it over
if he gave me a draft.

419
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,287
Well… That's…

420
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,499
Mr. Hong will be credited
as the author of the op-ed.

421
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,251
I also mentioned that if I wrote it,

422
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:05,504
it would be like deceiving the readers.

423
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,508
My apologies, sir. I--

424
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:11,719
Yullim is one of the top five
law firms in Korea.

425
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:14,346
They must have requested an op-ed
because they wanted to hear

426
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,473
from a partner
at one of the top five law firms.

427
00:25:16,557 --> 00:25:18,308
If I have to write it…

428
00:25:18,392 --> 00:25:19,768
Well, I'd be thrilled,

429
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:22,438
but shouldn't I be credited
as the author, then?

430
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:25,024
Or at least as a co-author.

431
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:26,775
Why don't we have a chat?

432
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:28,485
And while we're at it,

433
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:32,448
why did you have Mr. Ji and me
do due diligence on that closed case?

434
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:33,699
Wasn't that a pointless drill?

435
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,242
"Pointless drill"?

436
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,787
Man… being at the top of your class

437
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:41,123
has inflated your ego
to an unmanageable size.

438
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,625
I don't want to mimic
what a salary thief said,

439
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:46,045
but this is workplace harassment.

440
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:48,756
What did you say, punk?
Have you lost your damn mind?

441
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:50,924
The meeting is at 2:30?

442
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:53,844
Yes, sir. It's at 2:30.

443
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:56,513
We'll probably hit traffic.
We should leave now.

444
00:25:56,597 --> 00:25:57,848
Yes, sir.

445
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:25,834
Thank you.

446
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,920
I wasn't trying to help you.

447
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,630
The meeting was coming up.

448
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:32,091
And what about Mr. Lee?

449
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:34,510
The two of us will be handling this case.

450
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:46,396
We're here for the 2:30 meeting.

451
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,439
Where are you from?

452
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,191
Yullim Law Firm.

453
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:50,317
Okay.

454
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:53,237
I guess the client isn't here yet.

455
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:57,282
I don't see a 2:30 meeting.
Who was it scheduled with?

456
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:59,118
Mr. Han Seong-chan.

457
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:00,369
Just a moment.

458
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:05,082
- Oh, you mean the two o'clock meeting?
- Two o'clock?

459
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:07,876
The civil and criminal case
involving Hanun Express, right?

460
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:11,004
Yes, that's right.

461
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:14,049
The meeting started at two,
and all the attendees arrived already.

462
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,344
Wasn't the meeting at 2:30?

463
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:21,431
Yes. I was told by Lee & Seo
that it was 2:30.

464
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:26,353
Mr. Kim Deok-ho got behind the wheel

465
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:28,772
after working 14 hours
and drinking alcohol on top of that.

466
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:32,943
Both driving under the influence
and drowsy driving have been confirmed.

467
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:37,030
A no-contact accident occurred due
to Mr. Kim's drunk driving and negligence.

468
00:27:37,114 --> 00:27:40,033
And as a result, our plaintiff suffered
both mental and physical injuries.

469
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:43,745
Thus, we are claiming
200 million won in damages.

470
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:46,456
Furthermore, my client
does not intend to settle

471
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:49,334
or show any leniency
regarding the criminal charges.

472
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:53,046
You know that the sentences are harsher
after the Min-sik Law was passed.

473
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:56,842
No, I did not drive drunk.

474
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,261
You keep making that claim,

475
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:03,182
but you were Breathalyzed and arrested
as a flagrant offender at the scene.

476
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:04,391
No, I…

477
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:07,352
I just drank some instant coffee.

478
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:10,939
I honestly did not know
there was alcohol in it. I swear.

479
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:12,649
Are you being serious right now?

480
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:15,903
I'm sorry.

481
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,071
Please forgive me.

482
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:19,823
Forgive you?

483
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:24,745
You ask for forgiveness
after leaving someone's kid disabled?

484
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:29,041
If you want to be forgiven,

485
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:31,126
cripple your child and bring them here.

486
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,419
Ma'am.

487
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:35,047
Break their legs and drag them here!

488
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,089
Ma'am, please calm down.

489
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:39,259
Get down and beg at least.

490
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:41,470
Mr. Kim, do you have 200 million?

491
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:44,848
Our insurance won't cover
a drunk driving accident.

492
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:47,434
That means you have to pay everything
out of your pocket.

493
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:48,685
Do you know how much

494
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:50,729
the criminal fine will be
without a settlement?

495
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:53,232
You'll have to pay for all that too.

496
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:56,360
Where would I find that kind of money?

497
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:57,611
Exactly!

498
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,988
Pardon me.

499
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:03,116
So get on your hands and knees,

500
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,911
and beg for forgiveness
like your life depended on it.

501
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,682
I'm sorry.

502
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,309
Please forgive me.

503
00:29:35,983 --> 00:29:37,276
Please get up.

504
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:46,785
Please return to your seat.

505
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:55,294
I get that you're scared,
but let's play fair, shall we?

506
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:56,962
What are you talking about?

507
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:01,049
<i>So, to summarize,</i>

508
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:02,801
Mr. Kim Deok-ho's drunk driving

509
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:05,095
and negligence caused
a no-contact accident,

510
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:07,514
resulting in the plaintiff's
mental and physical injuries--

511
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:08,598
Hold on.

512
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:12,769
On what grounds are you claiming
the no-contact accident

513
00:30:12,853 --> 00:30:14,938
caused the plaintiff's physical injuries?

514
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:22,821
Nowhere does it say in this brief
submitted by the plaintiff

515
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,114
that there is a causal link

516
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:26,074
between the no-contact accident
and his injuries.

517
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:27,784
It's just a matter of common sense.

518
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:29,911
"Common sense"?

519
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:32,706
Since when did lawyers rely
on common sense and not legal reasoning?

520
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:35,917
A perfectly healthy child became paralyzed
from the waist down after the accident.

521
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:38,462
What could possibly negate
that causal link?

522
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:41,715
If there had been a collision,
the causal link would be irrefutable.

523
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:44,760
There was no collision,
but there certainly was a threat of one.

524
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,220
The threat of a collision
led to psychological shock,

525
00:30:47,304 --> 00:30:48,847
and it manifested as physical symptoms.

526
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,974
The human mind is mysterious.

527
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:54,269
You must prove that the threat
of a collision led the plaintiff

528
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:57,814
to suffer psychological shock leading
to the paralysis of his legs.

529
00:30:57,898 --> 00:30:59,566
That is the plaintiff's burden of proof.

530
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:06,406
It seems you remain
unprepared on that front.

531
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:09,534
We should not waste any more time
when time is money for us.

532
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:12,537
Please reach out when you are prepared.

533
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:14,873
We can leave now.

534
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,386
What the…

535
00:31:28,345 --> 00:31:30,639
What is that lawyer talking about?

536
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:35,769
Let's request a psychiatric assessment
of the plaintiff during pretrial.

537
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:37,270
Yes, sir. Understood.

538
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:41,400
You can lead the pretrial procedure.

539
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:42,901
Yes…

540
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,154
Wait, me?

541
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:47,406
What's wrong?

542
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:48,907
Not confident?

543
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,868
I am. I'll give it a go.

544
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:56,164
First, prepare a draft of the brief.

545
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,542
Yes, sir.

546
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:04,631
COURT

547
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:07,300
This case is quite a simple one.

548
00:32:07,384 --> 00:32:10,303
The defendant, Mr. Kim Deok-ho,

549
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:11,555
drove in a state of exhaustion

550
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:14,266
after working for over 14 hours
and even consuming alcohol.

551
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:18,478
Despite being fully aware
of the accident risks,

552
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:19,855
he got behind the wheel,

553
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:23,650
and that negligence
caused a no-contact accident.

554
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:27,154
The defendant's unlawful actions
did not cause a physical collision,

555
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:28,697
but the threat of one was posed,

556
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,700
and the plaintiff suffered
mental and physical injuries as a result.

557
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,578
We seek 200 million won in damages.

558
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:37,122
Thank you.

559
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:38,957
Defense counsel.

560
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,761
The defense argues
that the plaintiff's medical condition

561
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:53,680
was not caused by the threat of collision

562
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:56,725
but by the overreaction displayed
by the plaintiff's mother,

563
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,060
Ms. Lee Sang-mi, at the scene.

564
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:00,562
Hold on, what was that?

565
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,564
Your Honor, this is unacceptable.

566
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,274
I don't know what their scheme is--

567
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:05,901
Maintain decorum.

568
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:09,529
We cannot accept the defendant's argument.

569
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:13,658
The plaintiff's counsel has failed
to provide any evidence

570
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:17,078
that proves the threat of collision
caused the plaintiff's medical condition.

571
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:19,831
Since we're still unable to confirm
what the exact cause was,

572
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:21,541
we request

573
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:24,586
a psychiatric assessment
of the plaintiff's mental state,

574
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,838
which remains central to this case.

575
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:28,673
Thank you.

576
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:31,259
Does the plaintiff's counsel consent?

577
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:33,803
Plaintiff's counsel.

578
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:39,184
Yes, we consent.

579
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:40,310
Seriously?

580
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:45,190
Haven't you done enough
to torture my child?

581
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:49,778
Submit a request
for the plaintiff's medical records

582
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,238
and review them thoroughly.

583
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:52,697
Yes, sir.

584
00:33:58,954 --> 00:33:59,871
Is there anything else?

585
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:01,498
No, but…

586
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:04,751
I was just wondering
if you had something to say.

587
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:09,422
Perhaps an assessment
of the argument I just made in court…

588
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:14,302
Earlier…

589
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:17,055
you did well.

590
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:20,475
Thank you!

591
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:28,483
I see.

592
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:30,485
I'll let her know.

593
00:34:32,946 --> 00:34:35,240
Ma'am, unfortunately,

594
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:37,576
the doctor is not available for a meeting.

595
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:40,120
- I see…
- Court orders were followed,

596
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:42,289
and the medical records
were already submitted.

597
00:34:42,372 --> 00:34:44,958
The doctor says
we are under no obligation to meet

598
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,586
with the patient's opposing counsel
one-on-one.

599
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:51,089
I just have one simple question to ask.

600
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:52,882
Even so…

601
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:56,011
Sorry.

602
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:17,490
Hyo-min!

603
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:23,246
- Oh, right!
- Are you here to see me?

604
00:35:23,997 --> 00:35:25,290
No, for work.

605
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,751
Why are you at a hospital for work?

606
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:31,463
Well, the plaintiff is
a five-year-old boy, and I noticed

607
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,923
he visited the hospital
five or six times a week,

608
00:35:34,007 --> 00:35:35,342
but there were no prescriptions.

609
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:38,845
If he was here that frequently,
he must have a serious illness,

610
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:40,597
so it's strange that there are no records.

611
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,059
I was going to ask his doctor,
but they refused to meet with me.

612
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,436
And… you're the defendant's counsel?

613
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:47,395
Yes.

614
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:48,980
Then it's only natural.

615
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:51,274
Why would they meet the opposing counsel?

616
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:55,612
But if there are no prescription records
despite frequent hospital visits,

617
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,366
it could be a case
of Munchausen syndrome or hypochondria.

618
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,369
"Munchausen"? What's that?

619
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:06,748
Munchausen syndrome is a mental disorder
characterized by faking symptoms.

620
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,166
They're physically healthy

621
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:10,585
but fake illnesses
to receive attention from others.

622
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:14,047
And hypochondria is an anxiety disorder

623
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,216
where patients believe
they are seriously ill,

624
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:18,843
or their fear of a serious illness
becomes so intense

625
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:21,221
that they start obsessing
over their health.

626
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:24,391
I see…

627
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:30,397
Thanks, Seol-a. See you at home later.

628
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:32,857
I'll pick up something tasty!

629
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,068
I want beef.

630
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:36,653
Not pork. Beef.

631
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:44,327
The psychiatric evaluation results
are just as we expected.

632
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:47,914
Yes, they should be able
to support our argument.

633
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:51,334
And it seems the plaintiff suffered

634
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:54,504
from Munchausen syndrome or hypochondria
due to his overprotective mother.

635
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:55,588
Why do you say that?

636
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:58,049
He visited the hospital
five or six times a week,

637
00:36:58,133 --> 00:37:00,260
but there are no prescription records.

638
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:04,639
That could also serve as evidence
to support our argument.

639
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,310
Favorable testimony from the plaintiff's
attending physician is unlikely.

640
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:11,354
It would be ideal
if we could obtain a statement

641
00:37:11,438 --> 00:37:13,064
from a renowned pediatrician.

642
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,650
- Yes, understood.
- And…

643
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:18,695
I reviewed your draft.

644
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:22,490
That's all you could cook up
with those great ingredients?

645
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:26,119
You're trying to argue
that the defendant is not to blame

646
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:28,079
for the plaintiff's current state, right?

647
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:31,499
Yes, that's right.

648
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:34,711
In other words,
the plaintiff ended up like that

649
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:37,088
because of his mother.

650
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:38,465
- That might be taking it--
- No.

651
00:37:38,548 --> 00:37:39,883
That's just enough.

652
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,469
If we do not present another cause,

653
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:44,137
we cannot negate the causal link

654
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,973
between the no-contact accident
and the plaintiff's state.

655
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:49,809
Yes, but the plaintiff's mother--

656
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:51,102
I will revise the brief.

657
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:57,525
Yes, sir.

658
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:18,463
Hyo-min.

659
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:26,888
Wow, it's Hyo-min.

660
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,974
What took you so long?

661
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,770
You just have to pull out
all the stops, don't you?

662
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:36,981
Why would you say such a hurtful thing?

663
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:39,150
You're hurt? Why would you be hurt?

664
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:40,819
Of course I'm hurt.

665
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:43,112
You blocked my number
as soon as we broke up.

666
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:46,241
You probably deleted all our photos too.

667
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:49,369
One of us went on a blind date
right after the breakup.

668
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:50,411
That was…

669
00:38:51,538 --> 00:38:54,207
a mistake that I made because I panicked.

670
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:57,502
Would you kill someone
and call it a "mistake"?

671
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,796
I got scared as I was listening to you.

672
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:04,676
I was afraid my child would end up
with an inherited disability.

673
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:08,012
How could I marry you, feeling like that?

674
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:12,141
Rationally, I thought breaking up
would be the right choice,

675
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:13,893
but my heart

676
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,229
refused to follow my head.

677
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:18,189
So without even realizing it, I--

678
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:19,566
Hey.

679
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:22,735
If you want to become a joke,
leave me out of it. Stay away.

680
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:27,282
And if we ever meet professionally,
don't slip up.

681
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:30,159
Hey, Kang Hyo-min.

682
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:03,651
Ji-eun.

683
00:40:05,695 --> 00:40:06,905
What?

684
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:07,989
Where's my plate?

685
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:10,617
Your mom threw it out when she stopped by.

686
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,826
It was chipped.

687
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,202
My mom was here?

688
00:40:13,286 --> 00:40:15,371
Yeah, couldn't you tell from the fridge?

689
00:40:15,455 --> 00:40:17,624
It's chock-full of new side dishes.

690
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:20,168
Our domestic fairy, Lady Choi Eun-hee,

691
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,836
restocked it before leaving.

692
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:27,133
Why would my mom touch my things?

693
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:28,301
What?

694
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:31,054
What's up? What's wrong?

695
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:33,139
Why would you let
my mom throw out my plate?

696
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:37,644
Well, she wanted to toss it
because it was chipped and cracked…

697
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:40,563
That's Hyo-min's favorite plate.

698
00:40:41,731 --> 00:40:42,941
I know that.

699
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:45,401
But it was her mom…

700
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:48,488
Hey, Hyo-min! Where are you going?

701
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,085
Hyo-min.

702
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:03,920
Did something happen?

703
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:05,254
Why did you toss it?

704
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:06,255
What?

705
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:07,840
Why did you toss it?

706
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:09,968
Do only perfect things deserve to exist?

707
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:14,305
What are you talking about?

708
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:17,141
Why would you toss it
just because it was chipped?

709
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:19,560
Are you talking about the plate?

710
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:21,479
There are plenty of good plates.

711
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:24,440
Why use a chipped one
and invite misfortune?

712
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:26,192
I'll buy you another one just like it.

713
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:27,318
No.

714
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:29,862
Not the plate.

715
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:32,782
I'm talking about my sister.

716
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:34,033
Is Hyo-min here?

717
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,829
You would've thrown me away
if I also had a disability.

718
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:41,791
Just like how you tossed out
my sister and my plate.

719
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:43,042
Hyo-min…

720
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:45,253
What are you talking--

721
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,046
I broke up with Seong-chan.

722
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,048
Why?

723
00:41:49,132 --> 00:41:51,759
He broke up with me
because of my disabled sister.

724
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:52,885
What?

725
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:55,555
What sort of nonsense is that?

726
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:56,639
What's wrong?

727
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:59,142
You and Seong-chan are
just birds of a feather.

728
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:01,102
Hyo-min, that's enough.

729
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:04,105
You didn't even act like this
as a teenager.

730
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:06,441
Don't come to my house
without my permission.

731
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:09,986
And don't toss out
my things without my permission.

732
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:28,838
How pathetic…

733
00:42:30,298 --> 00:42:33,092
Mad at one thing, lashing out at another.

734
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:44,020
COURT IN SESSION

735
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:45,772
Did you assess
the plaintiff's mental state?

736
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:47,607
FIRST HEARING OF NO-COLLISION CASE

737
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:49,067
- Yes.
- And your findings?

738
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:50,818
He has a low EQ

739
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:52,278
and has separation anxiety

740
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:54,155
due to his strong
attachment to his mother.

741
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,156
WITNESS

742
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,657
I believe it has progressed

743
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:59,660
to psychological enmeshment
with his mother.

744
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:01,788
Can you explain
"psychological enmeshment"?

745
00:43:01,871 --> 00:43:03,039
Simply put,

746
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:05,750
the child cannot make
independent judgments

747
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:08,669
that go against
the mother's words and actions.

748
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:10,046
Look here!

749
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:12,215
As if making my son
a damn cripple wasn't enough,

750
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:15,635
now you want to make him into some moron?

751
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:17,720
Plaintiff, quiet down.

752
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:19,555
But Your Honor--

753
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:21,349
You'll only hurt our case.

754
00:43:24,477 --> 00:43:28,106
This is how Ms. Lee Sang-mi, his mother,
reacted at the time of the accident.

755
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:29,524
Please play the video.

756
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:43,329
How?

757
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:45,248
How could you?

758
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:48,376
<i>What do I do?</i>

759
00:43:51,254 --> 00:43:52,588
Is she insane?

760
00:43:55,258 --> 00:43:57,802
Can you assess
Ms. Lee's mental state there?

761
00:43:57,885 --> 00:44:00,138
She seems to be
in a state of extreme shock.

762
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:02,181
Even the witness statements mention

763
00:44:02,265 --> 00:44:04,225
the plaintiff's mother
screaming and overreacting--

764
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:05,977
"Overreacting"?

765
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,688
What sort of mother remains calm
after a truck hits their kid?

766
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:10,148
Please try to calm down.

767
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:12,108
Yes, that's it.

768
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:16,112
When Ms. Lee saw the plaintiff
collapse in front of the delivery truck,

769
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:18,239
she was certain a collision had occurred.

770
00:44:19,115 --> 00:44:21,951
And when the plaintiff, who was
psychologically enmeshed with his mother,

771
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:24,078
observed her reaction,

772
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:26,747
could he have believed
he was actually hit by the truck?

773
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:28,958
Yes, that is possible.

774
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:31,711
Then, that false belief

775
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:35,214
could have caused
his current medical condition, correct?

776
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:38,509
I believe it is possible.

777
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:41,554
No further questions.

778
00:44:44,182 --> 00:44:45,349
All right.

779
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:48,102
The plaintiff's counsel
may now cross-examine.

780
00:44:52,732 --> 00:44:53,816
Well…

781
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:55,568
just now,

782
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:59,864
you claimed the plaintiff was
psychologically enmeshed with his mother.

783
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:03,910
Can you diagnose that
with such a brief mental evaluation?

784
00:45:03,993 --> 00:45:05,786
There is one test

785
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:09,165
that has been proven
to diagnose enmeshment the best.

786
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:12,126
After the child is asked a question
that matches their intelligence level,

787
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:16,005
the mother deliberately gives
the wrong answer before the child answers.

788
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:21,677
<i>For our test, we drew</i>
<i>six numbered lines on a piece of paper.</i>

789
00:45:21,761 --> 00:45:23,846
<i>Number three was drawn the longest,</i>

790
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:26,182
<i>with number five coming in second.</i>

791
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:30,144
<i>We then asked the child</i>
<i>which line was the longest,</i>

792
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:33,898
<i>and before they answered, their mother</i>
<i>deliberately gave the wrong answer.</i>

793
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:38,110
I think number five is the longest.
What do you think, Ri-a?

794
00:45:38,194 --> 00:45:41,280
<i>Most kids around Min-guk's age</i>

795
00:45:41,364 --> 00:45:42,531
<i>gave an answer</i>

796
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:44,784
<i>- they believed to be right…</i>
- You think it's number three?

797
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:47,036
<i>…in their own way, actively or passively.</i>

798
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:50,665
<i>- A select few gave the same answer…</i>
- I think number five is the longest.

799
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:52,667
<i>- …as their mother…</i>
- It's number three.

800
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,126
<i>- …but later confessed…</i>
- I see.

801
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:55,419
<i>…to lying when we were alone.</i>

802
00:45:55,503 --> 00:45:56,671
Is three the longest?

803
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:58,381
<i>- However…</i>
- Do you think that's the longest?

804
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:00,216
<i>…Min-guk was different.</i>

805
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,886
I think number five is the longest.
What do you think?

806
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:07,723
Number five.

807
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:12,561
<i>When Min-guk's mother told him</i>
<i>number five was the longest,</i>

808
00:46:12,645 --> 00:46:14,105
<i>he gave the same answer,</i>

809
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:16,315
and we couldn't detect a lie.

810
00:46:16,399 --> 00:46:20,069
Thus, even with questions he was
perfectly capable of answering himself,

811
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:25,199
he accepted his mother's wrong answer
as the correct one.

812
00:46:28,286 --> 00:46:31,914
What was your profession
before Min-guk was born?

813
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:34,458
I was an accountant.

814
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:36,877
Why did you quit such a good job?

815
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:41,799
The workload was too intense
to juggle with childcare.

816
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,135
Does your family live nearby?

817
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:46,637
No, they're all in Canada.

818
00:46:46,721 --> 00:46:48,597
When did you see them last?

819
00:46:48,681 --> 00:46:52,018
Objection, Your Honor. Relevance?

820
00:46:52,101 --> 00:46:55,021
The plaintiff's mental state
is the core of this case.

821
00:46:55,104 --> 00:46:58,983
And Ms. Lee would've had
the biggest impact on the plaintiff.

822
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:02,194
Assessing her mental state
is highly relevant to this case.

823
00:47:02,278 --> 00:47:04,697
Yes. This seems relevant.

824
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:06,866
The witness may answer.

825
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:12,997
It was around Min-guk's first birthday.

826
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:15,416
Do you see your friends often?

827
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:16,917
No.

828
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:18,669
When was the last time?

829
00:47:18,753 --> 00:47:20,963
I haven't since I got pregnant
with Min-guk.

830
00:47:21,047 --> 00:47:22,715
Your husband is a famous doctor, correct?

831
00:47:23,716 --> 00:47:25,760
- Yes.
- And not currently in Korea, correct?

832
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:26,844
Yes.

833
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:29,388
He's in a doctoral program
at Johns Hopkins.

834
00:47:30,056 --> 00:47:31,349
To summarize,

835
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:36,103
after the plaintiff was born,
you gave up your career,

836
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:39,982
became isolated from friends and family,
and your husband remained busy.

837
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:42,735
Min-guk must have been your whole world.

838
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:44,570
What are you getting at?

839
00:47:45,363 --> 00:47:46,739
Did you breastfeed him?

840
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:48,699
Objection, Your Honor. Relevance?

841
00:47:48,783 --> 00:47:50,785
- It is relevant.
- Let's hear it first.

842
00:47:52,161 --> 00:47:53,704
The witness may answer.

843
00:47:58,334 --> 00:47:59,460
Yes.

844
00:48:00,086 --> 00:48:01,170
When was he weaned off?

845
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:04,965
Please answer.

846
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:10,054
He… hasn't been yet.

847
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:12,056
- What?
- What…

848
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:15,101
You're still breastfeeding
a 51-month-old child.

849
00:48:17,228 --> 00:48:19,855
Have you ever sent
the plaintiff to kindergarten?

850
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:22,858
- Yes.
- Can you specify the time period?

851
00:48:22,942 --> 00:48:24,527
For about a week.

852
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:25,986
Why such a short amount of time?

853
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:27,905
Min-guk had trouble adjusting

854
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:29,532
and hated being apart from me--

855
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:33,160
Your Honor. We'd like to submit
the kindergarten's testimony as evidence.

856
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,290
According to the testimony,

857
00:48:38,374 --> 00:48:41,043
the plaintiff initially struggled
with his separation from his mother

858
00:48:41,127 --> 00:48:43,796
but soon showed
notable signs of adjusting.

859
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:49,385
However, he stopped attending
without any prior notice.

860
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:55,349
Did you fear the plaintiff
would grow into an independent individual?

861
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:59,103
Because in doing so,
it would deny your existence?

862
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:02,356
You don't know anything about this.

863
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:09,196
These are the plaintiff's medical records.

864
00:49:10,156 --> 00:49:14,243
The plaintiff visited the hospital often.
Was it for a specific health issue?

865
00:49:14,994 --> 00:49:16,871
What does that have to do with this?

866
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:21,959
Frequent visits with symptoms
but no prescription records.

867
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:28,549
According to a pediatrician, there are
two possibilities in this scenario.

868
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:32,136
First, Munchausen syndrome.
Second, hypochondria.

869
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:33,471
In other words,

870
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:36,599
the plaintiff was already
in a compromised mental state

871
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:39,185
due to Ms. Lee's parenting style.

872
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:41,979
- He had a mental illness.
- How dare you!

873
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,024
What are you trying to say here?
You know nothing!

874
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:49,195
You know nothing…

875
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:52,656
I just…

876
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:56,744
gave everything I had
to raise my Min-guk well!

877
00:49:59,914 --> 00:50:03,292
I only loved him and protected him.

878
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:05,294
Yes, I'm sure you tried your best

879
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:07,004
to fill that void inside you.

880
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:11,175
And that selfish effort led
to obsession and smothering behavior,

881
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:13,260
before it became the poison

882
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:16,096
that ruined Min-guk like this, did it not?

883
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:22,311
As if ruining your child was not enough,
now you blame others?

884
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:24,647
Do you think you deserve
to be his mother after all this?

885
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:25,856
Objection, Your Honor.

886
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,900
- The counsel is--
- Counsel.

887
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:39,370
The plaintiff could remain disabled
for his whole life.

888
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:40,412
And that…

889
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:44,750
was caused
by your obsession and smothering,

890
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:46,502
not because of the defendant.

891
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:25,666
Did you have to say all that?

892
00:51:26,292 --> 00:51:28,210
You acted like you wanted to hurt her.

893
00:51:30,546 --> 00:51:32,214
Did you have to twist the knife,

894
00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:35,342
making it sound like she ruined
her beloved son's life?

895
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:37,636
Yes, that's how she'll realize it.

896
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:42,057
She lived with the delusion
that she was being a good mother

897
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:45,978
when, in reality, she just used her child

898
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:47,438
to fill her own emptiness.

899
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:51,775
Min-guk's mother loves him
more than she loves herself.

900
00:51:51,859 --> 00:51:54,778
She did her best and devoted herself
to expressing that love.

901
00:51:54,862 --> 00:51:56,363
Her love was a bit excessive,

902
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:59,283
but don't deny the intentions behind it.

903
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:03,621
Don't be so sure
that all mothers are devoted to their kids

904
00:52:03,704 --> 00:52:06,707
and selflessly love their kids
more than themselves.

905
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:08,375
Mothers are just people.

906
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:09,501
And people

907
00:52:10,419 --> 00:52:12,463
are selfish to the point of cruelty.

908
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:16,634
In this world, there are people
who don't want to become mothers

909
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:18,427
and those who should never be mothers.

910
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:19,553
I know.

911
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:23,098
I do.

912
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:27,478
Verbal blows are fine,
but the wrong hit could be fatal.

913
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:29,980
The truth can be poison
if it's used like one.

914
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:32,608
Ms. Kang, tread carefully.

915
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:43,952
Of course, a lawyer throws verbal blows.

916
00:52:44,036 --> 00:52:46,246
Should they hold back to spare feelings?

917
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:50,626
I mean, it's fine to strike verbally
to subdue your opponent,

918
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:53,170
but you can't stab their hearts like that.

919
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:56,382
When it comes to scorching words,
you're no joke, either.

920
00:52:56,465 --> 00:52:57,633
Yes, right.

921
00:52:58,175 --> 00:52:59,176
If she wasn't a softie,

922
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:01,595
Yoon Seok-hoon would be no match for her.

923
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:02,846
It's a gift.

924
00:53:03,514 --> 00:53:05,349
And I was the one who discovered it.

925
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:08,769
I played a big role
in her becoming a lawyer.

926
00:53:09,395 --> 00:53:11,689
Your mom is a renowned lawyer,

927
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:14,149
and your dad is a famous judge.

928
00:53:14,233 --> 00:53:16,777
You were born with legal genes.

929
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,737
Why do you refuse to become a lawyer?

930
00:53:19,238 --> 00:53:20,280
It's not fun.

931
00:53:20,948 --> 00:53:23,158
Who chooses a career
based on whether it's fun?

932
00:53:23,242 --> 00:53:24,868
Are you in a rebellious phase?

933
00:53:24,952 --> 00:53:27,454
Are you rebelling
against your mom or something?

934
00:53:27,538 --> 00:53:29,790
Why are you piling on too?

935
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:33,377
She's going through enough
with her pressure-induced dyslexia.

936
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:36,004
Poor baby.

937
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:39,383
You call that suffering?

938
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:42,136
She gets to slack off
all day because of it.

939
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:46,265
Dad!

940
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:48,475
Hey.

941
00:53:49,518 --> 00:53:50,477
- Hello.
- Hello.

942
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:52,312
Hey, there. Where are you three off to?

943
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:53,731
Our place.

944
00:53:53,814 --> 00:53:56,567
Why do you three always gather

945
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,402
at her teeny-tiny house every day?

946
00:53:58,485 --> 00:53:59,820
It's cozy.

947
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:00,988
Where are you going?

948
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:03,449
I'm having dinner
with the other factory workers.

949
00:54:03,532 --> 00:54:04,533
Did you all eat?

950
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,494
- We bought street food.
- All right.

951
00:54:07,578 --> 00:54:09,288
Have fun, and be nice to each other.

952
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:10,247
Go on now.

953
00:54:10,873 --> 00:54:11,790
- Go on.
- Goodbye.

954
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:16,587
Your daughter looks nothing like you.

955
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,046
I know, right?

956
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:22,968
Dad, you should go see a doctor.

957
00:54:23,469 --> 00:54:25,971
Don't worry about me. Go on now.

958
00:54:26,054 --> 00:54:27,014
Go.

959
00:54:28,724 --> 00:54:29,767
- Chang-bae.
- What?

960
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:31,727
Did you really sign the statement?

961
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:32,728
I did.

962
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:34,813
The medical expenses are chump change.

963
00:54:34,897 --> 00:54:36,774
Why would you sign it just for that?

964
00:54:36,857 --> 00:54:40,319
The boss didn't sign up
for workers' compensation.

965
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:46,074
He said the fines and surcharges
would be astronomical if we filed for it.

966
00:54:46,158 --> 00:54:48,660
He was bawling about how he would need
to shut down the factory.

967
00:54:48,744 --> 00:54:49,912
What choice did I have?

968
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:53,123
I can't have people
lose their jobs because of me.

969
00:55:08,931 --> 00:55:11,266
They fit perfectly.

970
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:14,520
- They don't look like your mom's clothes.
- Really?

971
00:55:14,603 --> 00:55:15,854
I feel a bit awkward.

972
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:18,482
No, it looks good.

973
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:21,276
- You can do this, right?
- Of course.

974
00:55:41,255 --> 00:55:42,673
The factory manager's accident

975
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:45,592
was undeniably a workplace injury
caused by outdated machinery

976
00:55:45,676 --> 00:55:48,011
that should've been replaced beforehand.

977
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:51,139
He already signed
a statement taking responsibility.

978
00:55:51,223 --> 00:55:52,266
It's settled already.

979
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:54,142
Statements signed under coercion
are invalid.

980
00:55:54,226 --> 00:55:57,145
Failure to report an occupational injury
and neglecting equipment defects

981
00:55:57,229 --> 00:56:00,649
could result in imprisonment for violating
the Occupational Safety and Health Act.

982
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:04,653
Furthermore, attempting
to shift the blame onto the worker

983
00:56:04,736 --> 00:56:07,322
may constitute coercion
and be punishable under criminal law.

984
00:56:07,406 --> 00:56:09,283
You little brats.

985
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:12,035
How dare you meddle in grown-up matters!

986
00:56:12,536 --> 00:56:14,705
It's not too late to report
the industrial accident

987
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:16,623
and compensate
for medical bills and damages.

988
00:56:16,707 --> 00:56:18,041
If you don't,

989
00:56:19,001 --> 00:56:20,460
we will sue.

990
00:56:20,544 --> 00:56:22,087
What? Sue?

991
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:24,882
You must be kidding me right now.

992
00:56:24,965 --> 00:56:25,966
So what?

993
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:28,844
You'll see what's next in the courtroom.

994
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:31,388
If the company fails to compensate,
we will seize your assets

995
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:33,557
and immediately file
a lawsuit for damages.

996
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:36,268
For coercing and violating
the Occupational Safety and Health Act,

997
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:38,562
you will be sent to jail.

998
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:39,855
And one more thing.

999
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:42,858
The manager resigned
because of the accident,

1000
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:44,985
but he hasn't received
his severance pay yet.

1001
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:47,070
Well, that is because…

1002
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:50,073
The factory is going through
a tough time right now.

1003
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:52,367
There's a luxury foreign car
parked outside.

1004
00:56:52,451 --> 00:56:53,744
Isn't that yours, Mister?

1005
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:57,956
The Labor Standards Act states that
severance pay must be paid within 14 days.

1006
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,792
If you violate that,
you could face imprisonment.

1007
00:57:00,876 --> 00:57:04,212
If you don't pay the severance
and compensation immediately…

1008
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:09,384
we'll report the unpaid wages,
claim delayed interest,

1009
00:57:09,468 --> 00:57:11,595
and pursue
a provisional seizure of assets.

1010
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:14,514
- Well done!
- Yes!

1011
00:57:33,617 --> 00:57:35,077
<i>You were amazing back then, Hyo-min.</i>

1012
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,745
Well, you did hear things growing up.

1013
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:38,705
She probably got lessons
from inside the womb.

1014
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:41,708
Her mom worked as a lawyer
until she had to give birth.

1015
00:57:43,085 --> 00:57:45,337
Dad's boss might have
even been hospitalized from stress.

1016
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:47,464
He refused to pay until the very end,

1017
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:49,466
but when his accounts
and assets were seized,

1018
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:51,093
he offered land instead of money…

1019
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:52,636
- In Gwacheon.
- In Gwacheon.

1020
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:56,348
That part still gives me chills
every time I hear it.

1021
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:57,557
Back then,

1022
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:02,229
that land's value was not even worth
an eighth of what your father was due,

1023
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:05,148
and we tried so hard to stop him,
but your father said…

1024
00:58:07,943 --> 00:58:10,696
"Leave it.
It might pay for some taffy later."

1025
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:17,160
I sometimes thought my dad's kindness
was actually incompetence,

1026
00:58:17,244 --> 00:58:19,246
but it paid off for him in the end.

1027
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:21,748
That's how our Ji-eun is able to pursue

1028
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:24,793
a career in the arts
without worrying about money.

1029
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:29,923
Yes, hello.

1030
00:58:31,675 --> 00:58:32,676
Right now?

1031
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:34,219
No, it's fine.

1032
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:35,846
It's easier to do it at the office.

1033
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:37,222
Okay.

1034
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:40,267
Thanks for the meal.

1035
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:41,768
They need you back at the office?

1036
00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:42,936
Yeah.

1037
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:44,980
I thought it was odd you came home early.

1038
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:47,899
I know, right?

1039
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:30,484
I'm so sleepy!

1040
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:32,986
I wonder if there's an energy drink.

1041
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:35,030
There isn't any.

1042
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:37,824
Should I drink coffee?

1043
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:42,204
The coffee smells nice.

1044
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:47,042
Can't you make me a cup as well?

1045
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:57,469
Earlier at the courthouse,

1046
00:59:58,637 --> 01:00:00,305
I was out of line.

1047
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:03,225
I'm sorry.

1048
01:00:06,228 --> 01:00:08,230
Australia officially replaced

1049
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:12,067
the term "custody" with "parenting order."

1050
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:16,488
The term "custody" implied
a sense of ownership.

1051
01:00:16,988 --> 01:00:19,825
"Children are not property
the parents can own"

1052
01:00:20,325 --> 01:00:21,868
was the reasoning behind it.

1053
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:25,247
That's good reasoning.

1054
01:00:27,374 --> 01:00:28,375
I…

1055
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:31,670
have a twin sister.

1056
01:00:33,547 --> 01:00:35,507
I thought you were an only child.

1057
01:00:36,675 --> 01:00:38,260
My sister is hearing-impaired,

1058
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:41,471
and because my aunt and uncle
are also hearing-impaired,

1059
01:00:41,555 --> 01:00:42,722
they adopted her.

1060
01:00:43,932 --> 01:00:45,142
My mom…

1061
01:00:46,226 --> 01:00:47,769
was a perfectionist.

1062
01:00:49,855 --> 01:00:51,481
I think she saw my sister's disability

1063
01:00:51,565 --> 01:00:53,900
as one of her flaws.

1064
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:56,278
Because it was genetic.

1065
01:00:57,404 --> 01:01:00,949
It seemed like she was trying
to wash away that flaw through me.

1066
01:01:01,575 --> 01:01:04,369
She went above and beyond
to do her best in raising me.

1067
01:01:05,162 --> 01:01:07,330
She even somewhat gave up her career.

1068
01:01:11,835 --> 01:01:13,545
My mom was also a lawyer.

1069
01:01:14,045 --> 01:01:17,340
Everyone said her talent
was too good to waste.

1070
01:01:17,424 --> 01:01:20,510
I'm sure she wanted
to be rewarded in turn.

1071
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:26,308
I think that was also
a heavy burden for me.

1072
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:30,145
I ended up having a breakdown
in my senior year of high school.

1073
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:33,481
I developed dyslexia
and repeated my senior year three times.

1074
01:01:34,232 --> 01:01:36,902
You entered university in 2017,
and you're 28 now.

1075
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:39,154
Your age doesn't match up.

1076
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:42,866
I was in a gifted program
and skipped two grades when I was younger.

1077
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:49,664
My genius was a product
of nurture rather than nature.

1078
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:52,083
The result of my mom's efforts.

1079
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:56,838
Earlier in court,

1080
01:01:57,839 --> 01:01:59,966
it felt like you were yelling at my mom.

1081
01:02:01,468 --> 01:02:03,178
"Mothers are just people."

1082
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:07,224
"And people are selfish
to the point of cruelty."

1083
01:02:09,476 --> 01:02:12,187
Those words provide me with solace
for some reason.

1084
01:02:13,313 --> 01:02:15,273
Accepting it helped me understand.

1085
01:02:17,025 --> 01:02:18,109
And forgive.

1086
01:02:23,365 --> 01:02:25,951
FIVE YEARS AGO

1087
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:29,829
- Welcome back.
- Hello.

1088
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:31,373
What is all that?

1089
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:33,458
I think a cat tore it up.

1090
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:35,752
You don't need to help. Go inside.

1091
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:37,545
- Okay.
- Goodness.

1092
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:41,758
Wait, what's this?

1093
01:02:43,301 --> 01:02:44,469
Hold on…

1094
01:02:55,689 --> 01:02:58,233
Welcome home. Go and wash up.

1095
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:03,071
Are you pregnant?

1096
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:07,492
What's this out of the blue?

1097
01:03:08,076 --> 01:03:09,327
Go and wash up.

1098
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:12,872
I saw the pregnancy test.

1099
01:03:17,085 --> 01:03:18,086
The green onions…

1100
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,046
Where could they be?

1101
01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:24,259
You're not?

1102
01:03:24,342 --> 01:03:25,635
No.

1103
01:03:25,719 --> 01:03:27,178
Where could the green onions be?

1104
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:31,391
- They're over here.
- What?

1105
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:33,977
Here.

1106
01:03:34,561 --> 01:03:36,062
My goodness, where is my head?

1107
01:03:39,024 --> 01:03:40,692
Have you been to the OB-GYN?

1108
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:43,486
Yeah.

1109
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:46,031
What did they say?

1110
01:03:47,198 --> 01:03:48,116
I'm not.

1111
01:03:53,038 --> 01:03:55,290
Were you never pregnant or…

1112
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:56,875
did something happen later on?

1113
01:04:04,591 --> 01:04:06,092
When you went to see your family--

1114
01:04:06,176 --> 01:04:09,220
I don't want to talk about this anymore.

1115
01:04:11,056 --> 01:04:13,141
We had an agreement when we got married.

1116
01:04:15,143 --> 01:04:17,604
We agreed to live happily together
without a baby.

1117
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:24,194
I haven't cooked in a while.
It might not be good.

1118
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,242
I'll go and shower.

1119
01:04:46,925 --> 01:04:51,054
<i>A mother is still a woman and a person.</i>

1120
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:54,724
That's why they're capable
of making selfish choices.

1121
01:04:57,894 --> 01:04:59,020
Will accepting that…

1122
01:05:01,398 --> 01:05:02,524
help understand

1123
01:05:03,441 --> 01:05:04,859
and resolve any resentment?

1124
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:12,367
In my head, I understand…

1125
01:05:14,953 --> 01:05:16,287
but my heart still hasn't…

1126
01:05:22,127 --> 01:05:23,128
Excuse me.

1127
01:05:24,629 --> 01:05:28,133
Thank you for the coffee.

1128
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:30,468
Sure.

1129
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:53,199
Hash!

1130
01:05:53,741 --> 01:05:55,201
Careful. Here!

1131
01:06:06,212 --> 01:06:07,338
Dinner's ready.

1132
01:06:08,256 --> 01:06:09,174
Okay.

1133
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:11,759
I guess dinner is ready. Let's go inside.

1134
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:32,947
Our little Miracle must be starving.

1135
01:06:33,031 --> 01:06:34,157
Let's enjoy this meal.

1136
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:32,131
BEYOND THE BAR

1137
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:35,009
<i>I want to file a defamation lawsuit.</i>
<i>My housekeeper.</i>

1138
01:07:35,093 --> 01:07:37,178
<i>It got to a point where checking her</i>

1139
01:07:37,262 --> 01:07:39,264
<i>was the first thing I would do</i>
<i>whenever I was there,</i>

1140
01:07:39,347 --> 01:07:41,266
<i>wondering how badly</i>
<i>he had beaten her this time…</i>

1141
01:07:41,349 --> 01:07:43,017
I could see the truth in her eyes.

1142
01:07:43,101 --> 01:07:44,644
Are we judging the truth by her gaze?

1143
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:47,230
<i>Did Mr. Yoon seriously take that case?</i>

1144
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:50,733
<i>And it looks like they're acquaintances.</i>
<i>It seemed pretty intense.</i>

1145
01:07:51,276 --> 01:07:53,611
<i>And you stabbed our client in the back</i>
<i>to give her more ammo!</i>

1146
01:07:53,695 --> 01:07:55,196
<i>Absolutely ridiculous.</i>

1147
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:58,950
This devil really hit In-yeong!

1148
01:07:59,033 --> 01:08:02,620
<i>Do you do it to pick on the weak</i>
<i>and protect the powerful?</i>

1149
01:08:04,038 --> 01:08:05,290
<i>I'll report him myself.</i>

1150
01:08:10,044 --> 01:08:12,046
