Can we get the next group?

13
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:16,928
- Kim Seo-yeon.
- Here.

14
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:18,305
- Lee Dae-hun.
- Here.

15
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:19,598
Kang Hyo-min.

16
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,099
- Sung Jin-myeong.
- Here.

17
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:22,851
Please make your way inside.

18
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:27,147
Ms. Kang Hyo-min?

19
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:42,079
By any chance, did they call out…

20
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,163
"Kang Hyo-min" yet?

21
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:45,832
Yes. She did just now.

22
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,586
It seems Ms. Kang Hyo-min didn't make it.

23
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:50,587
All right.

24
00:02:57,928 --> 00:02:59,179
My apologies!

25
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:03,517
- What's going on?
- I'm Kang Hyo-min, here for the interview.

26
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:20,992
TWO HOURS AGO

27
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:22,703
Darn it…

28
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,009
You can't even tell now.

29
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:48,437
Leave.

30
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:50,605
Pardon?

31
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:55,068
Attorneys bill their time

32
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:58,405
for the work they do
in five-minute increments.

33
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,867
Time management skills are essential
in such a line of work.

34
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:02,826
Leave.

35
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:09,207
There could have been
some sort of emergency.

36
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,585
Can you tell us why you were late?

37
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,588
I was reading a book on the subway…

38
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:20,177
and missed my stop.

39
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,389
I appreciate the honesty,

40
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:28,518
but I do not believe your excuse
is valid enough for me to lend a hand.

41
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:30,604
Please show her out

42
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:33,023
and let us resume the interview.

43
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,024
Yes, sir.

44
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:37,527
This way, please.

45
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,037
I'll be waiting outside.

46
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,330
Should you change your mind…

My goodness.

52
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:30,372
- Sir.
- Yes?

53
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,624
You do know
who that late applicant was, right?

54
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:34,417
Who?

55
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:38,046
She was the winner of the 12th National
Law School Mock Trials.

56
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,840
That was her?

57
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,717
<i>Meritocracy.</i>

58
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:44,052
It is an inherently fair system.

59
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:46,596
MERITOCRACY: A SYSTEM WHERE
STATUS AND REWARDS DEPEND ON MERIT

60
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,182
One <i>should</i> succeed if they got into SNU
through skills and effort.

61
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,852
This is a universally accepted truth
and is considered common sense.

62
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:55,272
However, for meritocracy
to be fair and just, there <i>must be…</i>

63
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:58,733
There <i>must be</i>
one starting point for everybody.

64
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:00,610
Without equal starting points,

65
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:03,405
it is no longer
an impartial system based on merit

66
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,949
but the perpetuation of inherited elitism.

67
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:10,704
I'm sure some of you here

68
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:14,457
think lightly of the case before you.

69
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,710
You may wonder

70
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,462
if a prison sentence is too extreme
for a high school teacher

71
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,798
who tutored the child
of a wealthy family for a hefty fee.

72
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:25,552
However, this teacher's misconduct
compromises the principle of equality

73
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:28,722
and the very foundation of our society.

74
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:32,601
Are you saying she was the one
who turned down our offer?

75
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:34,936
Yes, I hear she is expected
to join Lee & Seo.

76
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:40,859
I mean, what do they have that we don't?
Why do we keep losing candidates to them?

77
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,193
NATIONAL LAW SCHOOL MOCK TRIALS

78
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:44,487
We should engage in fair competition.

79
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,323
We should do so to ensure

80
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:49,659
a sweet reward for those
who shed blood, sweat, and tears,

81
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:52,579
and disappointment and regret
for those who do not.

82
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:57,834
Only then can our society
see progress without regression.

83
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:01,588
Such evil as this teacher's misconduct
that inhibits our society's progress

84
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,298
<i>must</i> be uprooted.

85
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:10,889
In turn, the prosecution recommends
a sentence of three years in prison.

86
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:17,270
Really?

87
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:21,399
- Sir…
- Yes?

88
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:23,652
I think we might regret
sending her off like that.

89
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:25,487
- Right?
- Yes.

90
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,532
Should we ask to see her
if she's still waiting outside?

91
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:32,327
If you'd like.
I've already made up my mind.

92
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:35,914
I figured as much.

93
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:39,793
You value punctuality above all else.

94
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:42,587
But…

95
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:46,174
we only have
three candidates in this last group.

96
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:50,345
We've done interviews
with groups of four up until now.

97
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:53,556
Sure, if that's what you wish,
please have her come in.

98
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:57,852
Understood.

99
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:03,233
EXAMINEE ID

100
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,069
Here is a question for the group.

101
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:11,074
A man gets hit by a car
as he crosses the street on a crosswalk.

102
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:15,078
<i>He ends up losing his arm in the crash.</i>

103
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:18,498
<i>Then, a nearby pedestrian</i>
<i>suddenly grabs the arm and runs.</i>

104
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,792
<i>To get his arm back,</i>

105
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,211
<i>he files a complaint for restitution.</i>

106
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,922
How do you think the court ruled?

107
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,134
It must have been
in favor of the plaintiff.

108
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:32,262
- And the reasoning?
- The plaintiff is the owner of the arm.

109
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,722
It had to be returned.

110
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,391
How is "owner" defined legally?

111
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:37,934
As the person with ownership.

112
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,603
The plaintiff has ownership over that arm,

113
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,772
and the defendant
unlawfully took possession.

114
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,525
Hence, he can file
a complaint for restitution.

115
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:46,818
He can win.

116
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,905
Do the rest of you agree?

117
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:54,451
I don't.

118
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,997
There's a chance the complaint
for restitution could be dismissed.

119
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,624
And why do you think that?

120
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:05,211
Because it's unclear if the plaintiff
is the holder of said ownership.

121
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:09,049
If it doesn't belong to the plaintiff,
who does it belong to?

122
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,760
Isn't this just a matter of common sense?

123
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:16,723
I believe legal logic differs
from common sense.

124
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:18,933
Please continue.

125
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:23,688
If the law recognizes body parts
as subject to ownership,

126
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:26,107
then it must also permit
their discretionary disposal,

127
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:27,859
including the right to sell them.

128
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,236
So the right to commit suicide

129
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,697
and sell organs
must also be considered legal.

130
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:36,284
However, the law
does not recognize such rights

131
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,244
when it comes to body parts and life.

132
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:41,122
Thus, establishing the grounds
for a complaint based on ownership

133
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:42,248
would be difficult.

134
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,585
If he seeks restitution,

135
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,088
he will need to identify
another legal ground.

136
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:50,882
Here is the next question.

137
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:54,761
Mr. Kim is operating a train
carrying 100 passengers.

138
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,889
However, due to a large boulder
on the tracks ahead,

139
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,849
<i>a collision is imminent.</i>

140
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,851
<i>Mr. Kim wishes to flip down</i>
<i>the converter switch</i>

141
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,604
<i>to divert the train</i>
<i>to the right at the turnout,</i>

142
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,606
<i>but a technician stands in the way.</i>

143
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:10,318
<i>However, without the diversion,</i>
<i>all the passengers on the train will die.</i>

144
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,904
GOING BACK ONE MINUTE

145
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:16,533
<i>If the switch is flipped,</i>
<i>the train will be diverted to the right,</i>

146
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,452
<i>and the technician</i>
<i>will be crushed to death by the train.</i>

147
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,705
<i>In the end, Mr. Kim diverts the train</i>
<i>and saves the 100 passengers.</i>

148
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:26,042
<i>However, the technician</i>
<i>gets crushed to death by the train.</i>

149
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:30,755
Then, would Mr. Kim's conduct
constitute murder?

150
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,967
No, it would not constitute murder.

151
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,218
I believe that as well.

152
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,346
He had to make that choice
to save the majority.

153
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:41,599
It would constitute murder.

154
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:43,893
How so?

155
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:46,896
Because all the statutory elements
constituting the crime have been met.

156
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,107
The act of flipping the switch
was intentional,

157
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,025
and the technician died as a result.

158
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:53,695
Mr. Kim was aware
that the technician would die,

159
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,531
but he still proceeded.
Hence, it would constitute murder.

160
00:10:57,282 --> 00:11:01,161
Are you saying he must be sentenced
for murder even after saving 100 lives?

161
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,164
Would that be justice?

162
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,667
I did not say he should be sentenced.

163
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,378
The question asked
if it constituted murder,

164
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,464
and all the statutory elements
constituting the crime were met.

165
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:16,384
Hence, my answer is yes.
It does constitute murder.

166
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:19,304
However, if the court recognizes
grounds for justification,

167
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:20,972
he may be acquitted.

168
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,684
Even an act that is morally right

169
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,312
can become a crime
if the statutory elements are fulfilled.

170
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:30,106
Conversely, an immoral act
can avoid being a crime

171
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,151
if the statutory elements aren't met.

172
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:36,279
The law is not perfect.

173
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:40,116
Moral standards and legal standards
do not always align.

174
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,494
That is the constant struggle
for legal practitioners.

175
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:51,377
INDUCTION

176
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,880
AN INTRODUCTORY SESSION FOR NEW HIRES

177
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:57,091
LYRICIST OF THE YEAR

178
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:59,469
Why isn't she coming out?

179
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,137
Did her interview go well?

180
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:06,100
How did it go?

181
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:08,895
Well,

182
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,064
- I bombed it.
- How?

183
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:14,400
I left an hour early
to catch the subway so I wouldn't be late.

184
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:17,028
But the man sitting next to me
rushed out and left…

185
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,239
a book, and reading it…

186
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,824
made me late.

187
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:23,826
You're killing me.

188
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,245
Again?

189
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,330
I'm pretty sure you're the only one

190
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:30,041
who had an early offer
from Lee & Seo withdrawn due to tardiness.

191
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:33,169
That's why I left a whole hour early
to make sure I wasn't late.

192
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:36,673
What difference does that make?
You were still late in the end.

193
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,383
Whatever. I guess it wasn't meant to be.

194
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,550
Moron.

195
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,427
But still, cut her some slack.

196
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,889
What's she going to do?

197
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:47,308
<i>Hello, I'm reaching out</i>
<i>from Yullim Law Firm.</i>

198
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:49,560
<i>We are pleased to inform you</i>
<i>that you have passed</i>

199
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:51,688
<i>the entry-level attorney</i>
<i>recruitment process.</i>

200
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,692
What's wrong with her?

201
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,527
- I did it.
- What?

202
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,153
Yullim!

203
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:00,863
I passed!

204
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:03,241
- What? You passed?
- She got in?

205
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,534
- That's amazing.
- No way.

206
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,370
That's so amazing!

207
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:20,341
2025 YULLIM LAW FIRM

00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,242
Wait. Kang Hyo-min.

212
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,077
What are you doing here?

213
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,495
Shouldn't you be at Lee & Seo?

214
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:50,538
It just happened.

215
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,498
How come? You messed up, didn't you?

216
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:59,422
Anyway, that makes us
college classmates and colleagues.

217
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:01,966
I guess we share a special connection.

218
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,969
- What's wrong with you?
- Now, we will begin

219
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:07,764
the introduction of Yullim's
new entry-level attorneys

220
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,932
and the induction ceremony.

221
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:12,435
Can we have
the new attorneys step forward?

222
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,561
Yes, ma'am!

223
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,361
Hello.

224
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:22,320
NEWCOMER SELF-INTROS

225
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:26,157
My name is Oh Sang-cheol,
and I currently reside in Cheongdam-dong.

226
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,660
I will strive to be the most perfect
version of Oh Sang-cheol I can be,

227
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:32,830
who is not only young and rich
but also smart. Thank you.

228
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:35,541
Yullim. At your service!

229
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:37,543
Hello.

230
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:39,170
I am Ji Guk-hyeon, a 14th-class attorney

231
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,297
and an alumnus of SNU Law School.

232
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,883
I love to rap, so here's a verse
to express my determination and…

233
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:46,803
- Nervous?
- Yes, very.

234
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:52,266
Surely, we won't have zero applicants
for our team again this year.

235
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,559
Jeez…

236
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,436
There must be someone.

237
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:59,273
What did Mr. Yoon say?

238
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:01,317
"The right one always finds their way."

239
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,404
I hope he's at least nice
in his speech later.

240
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:05,822
Do you like any of them?

241
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,409
- That one over there.
- Who?

242
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,912
Kang Hyo-min,
first in her class at SNU Law School.

243
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,288
I see…

244
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:17,875
As a colleague,
I won't ask you to go easy on me.

245
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:22,380
Instead, I will prove my value
through my effort and skills.

246
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:25,842
My name is Choi Ho-yeon,
and I promise to give it my all.

247
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:32,974
Hello.

248
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:36,769
I am Kang Hyo-min,
14th-class attorney and SNU Law alumna.

249
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:39,689
I will do my best to learn all that I can
from my senior colleagues

250
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,399
to ensure I become a lawyer of principle

251
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,317
for the sake of justice in Korea.

252
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:44,277
Thank you.

253
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,950
That's Kang Hyo-min.

254
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,536
We at Financial Law
already called dibs on her.

255
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:55,246
Who cares about dibs?

256
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:58,291
We, the corporate law team,
will be her first choice anyway.

257
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,209
What's with that confidence?

258
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:04,130
Now, we will have the heads
of each team introduce their teams.

259
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,256
After the introductions,

260
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:08,092
the new entry-level attorneys
will choose their preferred teams.

261
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:10,678
If the number of applicants
exceeds the quota for a team,

262
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:13,806
the HR Committee will assign the teams.

263
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:17,143
Can we have the heads of each team
step up to the podium?

264
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:24,150
TEAM INTROS

265
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:34,452
Our corporate law team
is undisputedly comprised

266
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:37,163
of the best M&A attorneys in Korea.

267
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:41,083
Our team is led by the belief
that a law firm is about the people in it,

268
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:43,336
and we make every effort to ensure

269
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,838
our new recruits shine. And we especially…

270
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:47,423
Our antitrust law team…

271
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:50,843
You know that when sales take off,
they skyrocket, right?

272
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:53,679
As a result, our new recruits
will probably receive

273
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:55,515
the highest performance bonuses.

274
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:57,475
So what if they're high?

275
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,101
Work-life balance matters.

276
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,771
What good is a lot of money
without time to use it?

277
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:05,816
Our financial law team is known
for fostering excellent work-life balance.

278
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:07,527
Hello.

279
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:11,405
I am Yoon Seok-hoon, a partner
and the head of the litigation team.

280
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:16,911
In Litigation, a work-life balance is…

281
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,497
Please…

282
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:21,165
…a luxury we can't afford.

283
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:22,375
Damn it.

284
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:26,629
As a first-year attorney, your day starts
in the morning and ends at dawn.

285
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:29,799
If you perform all your given tasks well,

286
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,384
can you leave on time? Sure.

287
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,970
But will that be feasible
for a first-year?

288
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,721
You need time to stumble and slip up.

289
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,849
Performance bonus? I'm not sure.

290
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,686
What could a first-year know how to do?

291
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:45,106
You can't tell your ass
from your elbow at first.

292
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,611
He just made sure
no one picks Litigation again this year.

293
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,538
All right, we'll now proceed
with the Q&A portion.

294
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:02,707
Yes?

295
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,922
In-house corporate lawyers

296
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:12,508
are offered flexible hours
and excellent benefits.

297
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,511
Now, their salaries are comparable
to those at law firms.

298
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,388
Even if there is a notable difference,

299
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,432
I believe quality of life
is more important.

300
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:22,685
Could you go into further details

301
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,521
about each team's
flexible work policies or benefits?

302
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:29,191
All of you must be stressed out
about family events these days.

303
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:34,196
Our team independently provides
support for all major family events.

304
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,198
As you know, Yullim sponsors

305
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:39,118
its fifth and sixth-years to study abroad.

306
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:42,997
Unfortunately, we can't send everyone.
We only pick the top associates to go.

307
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,291
However, associates
of our antitrust law team

308
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,794
have all made the cut,
every single one of them.

309
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,380
Why? Because we bring in solid revenue.

310
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:52,798
Our financial law team

311
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:55,593
has implemented a policy
that permits a weekly work-from-home day.

312
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:58,971
Does the litigation team offer anything?

313
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:00,014
Please, say we do.

314
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,515
"As for all the benefits mentioned,

315
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:04,602
we're working on an internal plan
to roll out early next year." Say it.

316
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,103
We have none.

317
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:08,981
If you struggle with time management,

318
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:10,608
don't apply to this team.

319
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:12,902
And one last thing.

320
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:15,655
Since no one asked about it,

321
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:18,199
I assume you have yet to review
the details of your contracts.

322
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,700
Not all of you here

323
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:22,536
are guaranteed to become
associates at this firm.

324
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,915
After the probationary period,
performance reviews will determine

325
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,750
exactly which half of you stays.

326
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,753
In other words,
at the end of the probationary period,

327
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,338
one stays, and one is out.

328
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,217
- Half of us won't make it?
- Jeez…

329
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,718
So, the rumors <i>were</i> true.

330
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:40,054
They'll make us compete for survival.

331
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,764
That's what they all do now.

332
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:44,684
What choice do we have?
We just have to accept it

333
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,394
with 30,000 lawyers in the race.

334
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:49,480
Which team is your first pick?

335
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,023
I haven't decided yet.

336
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:53,067
But it'll definitely not be Litigation.

337
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,361
Totally. Not mine either.

338
00:19:58,489 --> 00:19:59,990
LABOR, FINANCIAL,
CRIMINAL, CORPORATE

339
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:01,784
TAX, LITIGATION,
ANTITRUST, MARITIME, ENERGY

340
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,119
TEAM SELECTION
FOUR MAX PER TEAM

341
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:06,247
IF THE QUOTA IS EXCEEDED
THE HR COMMITTEE WILL ASSIGN THE TEAMS

342
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,498
The entry-level attorneys

343
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:11,502
may now stand in front
of the team they most wish to join.

344
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,545
Yes, ma'am.

345
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:21,011
YULLIM WELCOMES ALL NEW LAWYERS
LET'S MAKE OUR DREAMS COME TRUE

346
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:24,640
Please be aware
that each team has four slots available.

347
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:26,267
CORPORATE, TAX, LITIGATION, ANTITRUST

348
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:40,114
LITIGATION

349
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:04,472
Hyo-min.

350
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:05,931
Hey.

351
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:16,484
LITIGATION

352
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,055
Take care.

353
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:48,265
Why not? Tell me.

354
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:51,435
Why are you turning away
a blessing that's fallen into our laps?

355
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:53,687
Bro!

356
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,148
I told you, no "bro" card
during business hours.

357
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:58,734
I get it. She was late,
and you take punctuality seriously.

358
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:00,736
But you said it was just two minutes.

359
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:04,990
I hear her early offer from Lee & Seo
was withdrawn because she didn't show up.

360
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:07,451
That is why she fell right into our hands.

361
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:08,786
Her phone was cracked,

362
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,539
<i>the stain on her shirt was</i>
<i>sloppily covered with correction fluid,</i>

363
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:12,873
<i>and her shoes were scuffed.</i>

364
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:15,459
Fine.

365
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:18,587
I'll be generous and say
she is not the most put-together.

366
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:21,423
But that shouldn't determine
her professional competence.

367
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,008
It's about preparation.

368
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:25,803
Choi Hyeon-cheol was also
a top graduate and capable.

369
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,304
But what good did that do?

370
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:30,474
He missed every deadline
and was a no-show at hearings.

371
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,894
For the lawyer, it just means
a couple months of disciplinary action.

372
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:36,230
But what about the client
who suffered for it?

373
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,400
To them, lawsuits are a last resort.

374
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,947
Wait, bro. Hold on.

375
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,032
She was just two minutes late.

376
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:48,492
Come on…

377
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,293
Are you busy?

378
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:59,086
Hey. No, come in.

379
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,045
Okay.

380
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:11,849
Can you tell him what you told me earlier?

381
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:15,352
Right. I want to be a lawyer to have fun.

382
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:21,400
No, that wasn't what I meant.

383
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:22,943
Right.

384
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,779
I really want to join the litigation team.

385
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:27,364
Yes, there we go.

386
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:30,200
Why? I mean…

387
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:32,244
Why did you turn down
all the other great teams?

388
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:35,539
This is not even corporate litigation.
It's personal litigation.

389
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:37,249
Any great reason why you want to join?

390
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:42,421
Love comes in many different shades.

391
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:45,716
Heterosexual, homosexual,
maternal, paternal, reverential,

392
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:48,969
brotherhood, friendship, camaraderie,
love for humanity, and self-love.

393
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:51,347
And that love hurts people.

394
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,934
Once that wound festers,
they consider legal action.

395
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:57,436
At that breaking point,
they believe their last resort,

396
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:00,814
the lawsuit, will protect
their happiness and their right to it.

397
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:03,901
I want to represent people like that.

398
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:06,946
Because it'd be fun?

399
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:10,240
Right.

400
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:17,498
Am I in? Why didn't he say anything?

401
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:20,250
Probably. He's always been
a man of few words.

402
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:23,462
He is never one for anecdotes,
chit-chat, side notes, or small talk.

403
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:25,214
I can see that.

404
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,049
Even his appearance is streamlined.

405
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:30,761
And he must be
really on top of his hygiene.

406
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:32,930
Can a guy even smell that good?

407
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:35,057
Maybe not?

408
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:36,642
He is quite clean.

409
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,978
It goes beyond his personality
and appearance.

410
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:43,023
Have you ever heard about
the Legendary Associate of Yullim?

411
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:44,400
No.

412
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,901
This first-year at Yullim

413
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:48,445
would come in at 9 a.m.
and go home at exactly 6 p.m.

414
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:51,740
Not a second earlier or later,
but his tasks were completed flawlessly.

415
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:53,784
Come on. You're making that up.

416
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:55,744
- That's impossible.
- I'm being serious.

417
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:57,287
He irritated this one partner so much,

418
00:24:57,371 --> 00:24:59,331
he was given
a complaint file this thick to review.

419
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:01,333
Enough material for two all-nighters,

420
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:02,960
but he left at exactly 6 p.m.

421
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:05,671
So when the partner asked him
if he had completed his work,

422
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:08,465
he responded with,
"I already emailed it to you," and left.

423
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:11,468
Then, the partner
immediately checked his inbox to find…

424
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:13,345
What did they find?

425
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:16,765
It was concise and to the point
without a single unnecessary word.

426
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:19,727
That brief still gets passed around
as the gold standard.

427
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,937
That's amazing…

428
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:23,147
And he was none other than…

429
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,274
Yoon Seok-hoon?

430
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:38,120
KANG HYO-MIN, JI GUK-HYEON
CHOI HO-YEON, OH SANG-CHEOL

431
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,872
KANG HYO-MIN

432
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:46,420
Let me sincerely welcome you
to our litigation team.

433
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:51,508
In this group, there's someone
who chose Litigation as their first pick,

434
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:54,595
someone who chose it
as their second choice,

435
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:57,556
and some who had no choice
because HR chose for them

436
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:58,682
to be here, but--

437
00:25:58,766 --> 00:26:01,393
Litigation was actually going
to be my first choice--

438
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:03,604
I'm not that petty.

439
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,731
Who cares about how you ended up here?

440
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,107
Is that so important?

441
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,235
- Is that so?
- Of course.

442
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:14,948
Now, this will be your first task.

443
00:26:15,032 --> 00:26:16,909
Two of these files
are for an advisory case

444
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:18,994
regarding shareholder meeting procedures.

445
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:21,997
You just need to sit in
on the shareholder meeting tomorrow

446
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:23,499
and enjoy the AC.

447
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:25,876
The other two files

448
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:30,089
concern a site inspection case
at a rural construction site.

449
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:33,133
The road ends halfway,
so you'll have to walk to the site

450
00:26:33,217 --> 00:26:35,803
while carrying these files.

451
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:41,350
Now, let's move on
to the long-awaited task assignments.

452
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,935
Ms. Kang Hyo-min.

453
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:46,814
- Yes?
- The Gangdong City Gas advisory case.

454
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,399
Request a vehicle and head out.

455
00:26:49,483 --> 00:26:50,484
If you request a vehicle,

456
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:53,112
they'll send you a driver
and a spacious car meant for CEOs.

457
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:54,738
- Have a safe trip.
- Wow…

458
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:56,073
Yes, sir.

459
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:57,699
And Mr. Ji Guk-hyeon.

460
00:26:57,783 --> 00:26:58,784
Yes, sir!

461
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,953
Sorry, I said the wrong name.

462
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:03,080
- Mr. Oh Sang-cheol.
- Yes?

463
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:06,250
Mr. Oh Sang-cheol,
who chose our team as his second choice.

464
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,376
Yes, that is right.

465
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:10,003
I was going to choose this team
as my first…

466
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:11,797
The Pacific City Gas advisory case.

467
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,173
Thank you.

468
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:15,843
However, you, Mr. Oh,
will take public transportation.

469
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:17,219
Yes, sir.

470
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:20,681
Mr. Ji Guk-hyeon and Ms. Choi Ho-yeon

471
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:23,100
will take on the site inspection case.

472
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:25,602
Go on.

473
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:26,770
Yes, sir…

474
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:28,355
What's with those faces?

475
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:29,857
- Right…
- Inside these files,

476
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:33,152
you will find detailed instructions.
Be sure to review them well.

477
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:36,113
- Yes, sir.
- Now, let us go and say hello.

478
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,406
Yes, sir.

479
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:38,949
Why do you look so down?

480
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:40,993
Mind your faces. You should be smiling.

481
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:43,162
- Are you that uncomfortable?
- A bit…

482
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:44,121
Goodness.

483
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:47,875
So much for not caring.

484
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,085
Must be nice, Hyo-min.

485
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:53,463
Kang Hyo-min,
my law school classmate and colleague.

486
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,465
What's wrong, Ji Guk-hyeon?

487
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:57,968
You're someone who thrives
on the sense of accomplishment

488
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,761
from conquering difficult tasks.

489
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:00,846
On that note,

490
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:04,391
why don't we switch cases?

491
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:07,227
No, thanks. I don't want to.

492
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,897
Right. Sure.

493
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:12,441
I'm sure you don't…

494
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:15,402
She's cold as ice.

495
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:21,116
THE MEETING OF POWERHOUSE LAWYERS

496
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,285
KIM YUL-SEONG
HUMAN RIGHTS ADVOCATE

497
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,370
CONGRATULATIONS
MINISTER OF JUSTICE

498
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:31,293
Come in.

499
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,213
Sir, I brought the new hires to say hello.

500
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,048
Right. Sure.

501
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:44,556
This is Attorney Kim Yul-seong,
the division head of the litigation team.

502
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,974
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, sir.

503
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:47,893
Hello. Take a seat.

504
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:55,525
- Sit.
- This orchid here…

505
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:58,362
Former Minister of Justice
Han Byeong-cheol gave it to me.

506
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:00,989
Most orchids live for about eight years.

507
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:03,951
But this one has been around
for more than eight years,

508
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:06,036
and it still looks quite healthy, no?

509
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:09,122
Its lifespan is affected
by the person who takes care of it.

510
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:11,500
Listen…

511
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:14,336
Do you know what Yullim's English name is?

512
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:17,256
I do. It's Shin, Ko & Kim.

513
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:20,509
Who do you think "Kim"
of Shin, Ko & Kim could be?

514
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:23,053
It is none other than you,
Mr. Kim Yul-seong.

515
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:24,554
That's right.

516
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,891
The fact that you joined a team
with a named partner as division head

517
00:29:27,975 --> 00:29:30,560
means that you are all as lucky
as this orchid here.

518
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:33,355
You joined a good team. Work hard.

519
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,398
Yes, sir!

520
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,191
Truth be told,

521
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:41,113
when I was younger,
I swam at the same pool as the president.

522
00:29:45,242 --> 00:29:47,536
I just thought I'd share. That's all.

523
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:54,251
- Wow.
- Anyhow…

524
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,087
Sir, the brief hasn't gone out yet.

525
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,381
Right. I was just about to send it.

526
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:00,882
- You should get going now.
- Yes, sir.

527
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:03,218
- Okay.
- Let's go.

528
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:08,307
I worked through the night
because you told me it was urgent.

529
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,392
Why are you still sitting on it?

530
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,436
Do you think all-nighters
are easy at my age?

531
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,896
Okay. I hear you.
Why do you keep bringing up your age?

532
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:18,859
Who was that graceful attorney
with the aura of a general?

533
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:19,901
Is she a partner?

534
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:21,945
- Associate. We joined the firm together.
- Pardon?

535
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:24,114
She's my colleague,
but she's ten years older than me.

536
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,574
She looks so young, though.

537
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:26,825
- Right?
- Yes.

538
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:28,118
But she's still an associate?

539
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:30,495
Yeah, a late bloomer.
She became a lawyer right before 40.

540
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:34,750
Every law firm has both
a superficial hierarchy and an actual one.

541
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,627
Mr. Kim Yul-seong
may be the division head on paper,

542
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:40,714
but Yoon Seok-hoon
and Heo Min-jeong hold the real power.

543
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:43,133
I can understand Mr. Yoon
because he is highly competent.

544
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:45,052
But how does an associate have real power?

545
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:46,636
Do you know what Mr. Kim is famous for?

546
00:30:47,304 --> 00:30:49,806
- He's Yullim's founder?
- He is a founder.

547
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,767
But he is also famous
for his low win rate.

548
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:54,227
While Attorneys Shin and Ko

549
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:57,189
built up Yullim's reputation
through corporate finance consulting,

550
00:30:57,272 --> 00:31:00,025
Mr. Kim oversaw litigations
but frequently lost in court.

551
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:02,986
Hasn't his win rate
been pretty high recently?

552
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,905
Correct. It's pretty solid now.

553
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:07,282
But who do you think is behind that?

554
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:10,202
No way…

555
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:12,579
Bingo. It's Heo Min-jeong.

556
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,749
Can an associate really be that talented?

557
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:18,668
That's why she's so confident,
despite being just an associate.

558
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:23,173
Let's go.

559
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:42,651
Even a newbie shouldn't confuse

560
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,653
provisional seizure with injunction.

561
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:46,655
My apologies, sir.

562
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:49,950
Is "my apologies" some kind
of catchphrase for the newbies?

563
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:53,203
How has that catchphrase
not gone out of style in ten years?

564
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:55,872
…BEARROWED MONEY…

565
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:03,630
…REKURN…

566
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,009
Who wrote up
this complaint for unpaid funds?

567
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,262
I did…

568
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:13,640
It has a clear structure
and solid reasoning,

569
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:15,308
but it was the worst brief.

570
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:17,602
I found three typos.

571
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:20,063
With one, you think, "She's only human."

572
00:32:20,147 --> 00:32:22,983
With two, you think,
"She must have had a lot on her plate."

573
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:25,193
After the third one,
it's a matter of effort.

574
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:27,904
Does a small claim mean
the case carries less weight?

575
00:32:29,573 --> 00:32:32,492
For the client,
one lawsuit could mean everything.

576
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:34,953
There's nothing worse
than a half-hearted brief.

577
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:37,789
- Do you understand?
- Yes, I'll keep that in mind.

578
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:39,166
Next.

579
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:42,294
Reference Number 231-73.

580
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:43,628
Our client is suing to recover

581
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:46,173
the purchase price
already paid to the defendant.

582
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:47,507
Who did the brief draft?

583
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:48,758
I did, sir.

584
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:51,803
Ms. Kang and Mr. Oh
were assigned the case.

585
00:32:56,558 --> 00:32:58,560
CONCLUSION:
AS SUCH, THE DEFENDANT

586
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,562
IS OBLIGATED TO PAY
THE PLAINTIFF AS RESTITUTION…

587
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:03,106
- Are you sure this is right?
- Pardon?

588
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:08,653
Here.

589
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:12,741
"As such, the defendant is obligated
to pay the plaintiff, as restitution,

590
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:15,035
the purchase price
under the aforementioned contract

591
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:19,498
plus interest from the payment date
until full repayment."

592
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:21,458
That's what it says here.

593
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:23,251
Yes.

594
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:29,966
Draft.

595
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:42,145
Well done.

596
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:44,856
Review and submit this.

597
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,191
Yes, sir.

598
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:47,234
What about mine, sir?

599
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:54,741
Read the conclusion.

600
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:02,749
"The defendant is obligated to pay

601
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:05,126
the purchase price
under the aforementioned contract

602
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,754
along with delay damages
calculated at an annual rate of 12%

603
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:10,590
under the Act on Expedition
of Legal Proceedings from the day

604
00:34:10,674 --> 00:34:14,719
after receiving the complaint to the date
of full payment, as unjust enrichment."

605
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:29,943
Explain it for us.

606
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,069
Okay.

607
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:34,656
If a contract is terminated,
a duty of restitution arises

608
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,283
under Article 548 of the Civil Act.

609
00:34:36,366 --> 00:34:37,993
If a declaration of intent is revoked,

610
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:41,955
"duty to return unjust enrichment"
arises under Article 741 of the Civil Act.

611
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:44,040
Thus, it would be inaccurate to say

612
00:34:44,124 --> 00:34:46,376
that cancellation leads
to a duty of restitution.

613
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:47,544
Furthermore, the seller

614
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:50,130
is not obligated to pay
statutory interest as part of the return.

615
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:51,172
Wow…

616
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:58,096
If you lack the necessary smarts,

617
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:00,849
you should at least
park yourself at a desk

618
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,560
to review it incessantly
and brainstorm persistently

619
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:05,478
before putting anything out.

620
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:06,771
My apologies, sir.

621
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:10,650
No more "My apologies" from newbies.

622
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:13,403
You act like it's some fix-all phrase.

623
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:16,615
It's the kind of irresponsible comment
I detest most.

624
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:22,287
Next.

625
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,414
That was the last item on the agenda.

626
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,213
At Yullim,

627
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:34,633
new non-attorney staff members

628
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:37,218
are the only ones addressed by name.

629
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:40,055
Then do you know why
I address the new attorney hires by name

630
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,431
and not "Attorney"?

631
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,017
Does passing the bar exam
make you an attorney?

632
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:47,979
Do you contribute any more
than those staff members?

633
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:50,607
In the Anglo-American sphere,

634
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:53,109
they add "Esq." after attorneys' names.

635
00:35:57,322 --> 00:36:00,200
It's an honorific used
to convey respect toward attorneys.

636
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:06,081
If you wish to be referred to as such,
let's act accordingly.

637
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:07,999
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

638
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:17,300
Jeez…

639
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:27,310
WOOD-FIRED CHICKEN

640
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:48,873
Mi-yeon! Seo-yeon!

641
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:50,375
- Ho-yeon!
- I'm home!

642
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:54,504
You must be so hungry. Guess what this is.

643
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:56,881
- Wow, chicken!
- Wow, chicken!

644
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:59,300
You must be so cold. Let's rush inside.

645
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:02,137
Why did you wait for me outside?

646
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,056
GANGDONG CITY GAS
BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AND FINANCIAL STATUS

647
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:19,696
We'll now move on
to the 2024 business report.

648
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:20,655
BUSINESS PERFORMANCE

649
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:23,950
City Gas sales volume
was 804 million cubic meters,

650
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:26,369
and the revenue was 492.9 billion won.

651
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:29,956
We posted a net profit
of 3.1 billion won for the period.

652
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,333
As you can see…

653
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:37,380
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
CASH FLOW STATEMENT

654
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,425
That will conclude

655
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:43,094
the 42nd annual shareholders' meeting.

656
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:44,179
Thank you.

657
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:55,398
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

658
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,276
The revenue for the past ten years…

659
00:37:59,027 --> 00:38:00,236
What about it?

660
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,199
In the last seven years,
only Onpyeong's revenue dropped sharply.

661
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,200
Why is that?

662
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,577
- Are you a shareholder?
- Well…

663
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:11,623
I'm Attorney Kang Hyo-min
from Yullim Law Firm,

664
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:13,291
here to advise on the meeting procedure.

665
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:14,250
I see.

666
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,836
But why are you curious about that?

667
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:20,632
I just found it a bit strange…

668
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:21,674
What exactly?

669
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:23,176
Well…

670
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:26,179
Forgive me, but was the meeting
mishandled in any way?

671
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:27,263
No.

672
00:38:27,347 --> 00:38:28,598
Then…

673
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:32,602
I don't believe
that's a matter you should question.

674
00:38:33,937 --> 00:38:35,396
Right…

675
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,606
Please excuse me.

676
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,998
- Hey.
<i>- Hello, sir.</i>

677
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:55,416
The meeting ended,

678
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,669
but there's something I need to look into.

679
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:59,587
<i>- "Look into"?</i>
- Yes.

680
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:01,381
So I might return a bit late.

681
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:02,590
<i>What are you looking into?</i>

682
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:04,801
- Was there a procedure issue?
<i>- No.</i>

683
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:07,595
I'll tell you the details
once I've looked into it a bit more.

684
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:15,645
ONPYEONG STATION

685
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:18,189
Does this bus go
to Onpyeong Hot Spring Village?

686
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:20,108
- Yes, it does.
- Okay.

687
00:39:23,236 --> 00:39:25,071
ONPYEONG HOT SPRING BATHHOUSE

688
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,876
COLD BATH - OUTDOOR HOT SPRING

689
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,721
SALT ROOM

690
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:55,977
FAR-INFRARED SAUNA BENEFITS

691
00:40:00,273 --> 00:40:01,566
- That was delicious.
- Good.

692
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:03,818
- Ma'am.
- Yes?

693
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:05,987
Has this bathhouse been around
for a long time?

694
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,530
Why? Did something bother you?

695
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:09,407
No, it's not that.

696
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,826
I just felt a sort of traditional vibe.

697
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,078
Yes, it's been around for 30 years.

698
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:16,289
- Is that so?
- Yes.

699
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:18,041
This place is open 24 hours, right?

700
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:20,752
- Of course.
- Has that been the case the past 30 years?

701
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,086
Of course.

702
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:42,398
Hasn't it been long enough to file
a missing person report at this point?

703
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:44,817
I know, right?

704
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:47,445
She's probably obsessing over
something again.

705
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:49,864
I went to law school with Hyo-min.

706
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:51,074
During group projects,

707
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:54,869
she'd become fixated on one thing
and obsess over it nonstop for three days.

708
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:57,330
If she's absent today, she could be fired.

709
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:06,005
Kang Hyo-min!

710
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:08,424
- What took you so long?
- What?

711
00:41:08,508 --> 00:41:09,926
Why is your phone off?

712
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:11,594
I couldn't find a place to charge it.

713
00:41:11,678 --> 00:41:12,929
You are unbelievable.

714
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,431
- Did you find a new obsession?
- What?

715
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:16,683
Ms. Kang!

716
00:41:18,768 --> 00:41:20,812
Where in the world have you been?

717
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,981
Wait… did you oversleep?

718
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:24,774
You should've at least dried your hair.

719
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:26,150
You're in big trouble…

720
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:27,527
Run over to Mr. Yoon now.

721
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,320
Go and apologize. No excuses.

722
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:33,032
No, I'll come with you.

723
00:41:33,116 --> 00:41:34,283
- Here.
- Okay.

724
00:41:34,367 --> 00:41:35,451
My goodness.

725
00:41:35,535 --> 00:41:37,328
- Watch what you say…
- What's her deal?

726
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:40,331
Come in.

727
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:51,884
Speak.

728
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:54,637
Ms. Kang clocked in.

729
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:01,853
And?

730
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:03,646
You were looking for her earlier.

731
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:05,398
That was three hours ago.

732
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:09,861
The recently hired newbie
with two unexcused absences already

733
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:11,779
showed up late today with wet hair…

734
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:14,198
I have nothing more to say.

735
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:15,742
Well, you see…

736
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:19,954
Sorry, sir. I mismanaged her.

737
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:21,456
Please, just don't.

738
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:28,171
I heard your early offer from Lee & Seo
was withdrawn because of your no-show.

739
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:30,006
Well, that was…

740
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:33,843
Report the unexcused absences to HR
and have them follow protocol.

741
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:35,928
Under Article 4.2 of your contract,

742
00:42:36,012 --> 00:42:38,306
poor performance
during your probationary period is enough

743
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:39,932
for disciplinary dismissal.

744
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:42,310
Tell them to start
the disciplinary proceedings.

745
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,020
- They weren't unexcused.
- Yes, sir.

746
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:46,397
You can speak to HR if you need to. Leave.

747
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:48,441
- Please…
- I was working off-site.

748
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,194
- "Working off-site"?
- Yes.

749
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,446
I attended the Gangdong City Gas meeting…

750
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:55,156
And the meeting took a few days?

751
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:58,201
No, the shareholders' meeting
ended after a few hours…

752
00:42:58,284 --> 00:42:59,869
Must I continue to listen to this?

753
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:01,370
I apologize, sir. Hurry up.

754
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,832
Wait… Can't you just hear me out first?

755
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:07,919
You're so self-centered.

756
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:10,630
From where I stand,
<i>you </i>seem self-centered.

757
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,924
Aren't we all attorneys here?

758
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:15,760
At least let me argue my case
before you give a verdict.

759
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:20,389
Two minutes.

760
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:24,352
I reviewed the meeting materials

761
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:27,814
and noticed that only Onpyeong's revenue
declined sharply in the past seven years.

762
00:43:27,897 --> 00:43:29,524
- Revenue?
- Yes.

763
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,943
So I was working off-site
to investigate the issue.

764
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:34,570
And why would you investigate that?

765
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,533
Because it was strange.

766
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:39,826
It's a hot spring village,

767
00:43:39,909 --> 00:43:41,869
and its bathhouses
are the biggest consumers of gas.

768
00:43:41,953 --> 00:43:45,123
I checked online and discovered
they had been open for 30 years.

769
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:47,875
It's odd that there was a decline.

770
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:49,836
So I went to investigate in person.

771
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:51,003
So, basically…

772
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:56,759
not a single employee
at Gangdong City Gas found it odd,

773
00:43:57,593 --> 00:43:59,720
but you alone found it odd

774
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:03,516
and had to skip work
to go investigate that hot spring village?

775
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:04,642
Yes.

776
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:08,104
I was there to consult
on the meeting procedures,

777
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:10,773
but I believe reviewing the actual meeting
is also a part of my job.

778
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:14,610
No company hires consulting attorneys
to have them space out at the meeting.

779
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:18,281
Yes, that is true.

780
00:44:18,948 --> 00:44:20,116
Well…

781
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:22,118
That is not why clients consult with us.

782
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:24,662
So, did you find something
in your investigation?

783
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:26,372
I went to the bathhouses in that village

784
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:29,584
and discovered they are open
24 hours a day while offering hot baths.

785
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:33,045
This is how every bathhouse there
has operated for more than 30 years.

786
00:44:33,963 --> 00:44:38,009
They were open 24 hours a day
30 years ago and seven years ago,

787
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:40,511
but the revenue declined sharply
seven years ago.

788
00:44:42,305 --> 00:44:43,764
The City Gas bill

789
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:47,643
is the basic charge plus
the usage amount times the applicable rate

790
00:44:47,727 --> 00:44:49,353
times 1.1.

791
00:44:49,437 --> 00:44:52,064
Usage is the meter reading
times the temp-pressure correction factor.

792
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:54,192
- Heat value per unit is--
- Get to the point.

793
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:58,321
I believe the usage amounts
were manipulated.

794
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:02,783
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

795
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:04,827
Do you have the files?

796
00:45:04,911 --> 00:45:05,828
Yes.

797
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:10,416
USAGE-BASED RATE TABLE:
BEFORE, AFTER, CHANGE RATE

798
00:45:16,756 --> 00:45:19,467
BUSINESS PERFORMANCE: ONPYEONG

799
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:22,011
ONPYEONG ACTUAL GAS COST TREND

800
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:24,138
YEAR 2021, 2022, 2023

801
00:45:24,222 --> 00:45:25,473
BALANCE SHEET

802
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,141
Jeez…

803
00:45:27,225 --> 00:45:28,517
Damn, Kang Hyo-min…

804
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:31,896
I think we have enough to notify them.

805
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:34,732
Who's our point person
at Gangdong City Gas?

806
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:36,317
Assistant Manager Kim Seok-jin.

807
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:40,321
- Set up a meeting with a general manager.
- Yes, sir.

808
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:46,661
This won't clear
your unexcused absences and tardiness.

809
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:49,163
Yes, sir.

810
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:51,040
If you act this recklessly again,

811
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:52,583
you'll be disciplined.

812
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:56,879
Yes. Understood.

813
00:45:59,799 --> 00:46:03,594
COURT

814
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:13,312
Are the defendant
and defense counsel present?

815
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:16,274
Yes. Attorney Kim Ji-un is present.

816
00:46:16,357 --> 00:46:17,400
Noted.

817
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:19,819
We shall now begin this hearing.

818
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:22,655
The counsel for the victim,
Gangdong City Gas,

819
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:25,241
Attorney Kang Hyo-min from Yullim,
is also present.

820
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:28,869
You might want to set
that bundle down next to you…

821
00:46:28,953 --> 00:46:29,954
Right.

822
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:36,210
Please note my attendance
in the court records.

823
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:38,629
Did you say you were
the legal counsel for the victim?

824
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:39,839
Yes, that is correct.

825
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:43,426
You don't need to shout your answers.

826
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,388
Record her attendance.

827
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:52,893
The defendant tore out approximately
25 cm of the city gas pipe and meter

828
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:55,688
connected to the boiler
in the sauna's mechanical room

829
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:58,816
and installed
an unauthorized copper pipe in its place

830
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:00,568
to illegally siphon city gas.

831
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:03,779
The stolen amount is not noted.
How much was it?

832
00:47:03,863 --> 00:47:04,822
Well, you see…

833
00:47:05,448 --> 00:47:06,407
It's still under review.

834
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:10,244
The trial can't proceed
without knowing the extent.

835
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:11,370
Yes, Your Honor…

836
00:47:11,454 --> 00:47:14,290
But because they manipulated
the system used to calculate gas usage,

837
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:16,584
assessing the extent of the theft
will take some time.

838
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,377
We'll submit it at the next hearing.

839
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:20,129
I understand.

840
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:24,675
It's not like we can install
a properly working meter next to it

841
00:47:24,759 --> 00:47:27,178
and compare the two.

842
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,013
Prosecutor.

843
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:30,348
Excuse me, Prosecutor.

844
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:32,641
We can estimate the stolen amount.

845
00:47:34,477 --> 00:47:37,605
Your Honor, may I have a moment
to speak with the victim's counsel?

846
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:39,357
Yes, you may.

847
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:42,485
We'll take a short recess.

848
00:47:52,328 --> 00:47:54,038
Based on my calculations,

849
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:58,751
a total of 2,486,839 cubic meters
were stolen over the last seven years,

850
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:01,545
worth approximately a market value
of 1,323,270,000 won.

851
00:48:01,629 --> 00:48:03,964
About 1.3 billion?
How did you get that number?

852
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:14,308
I visited all the saunas
in the area where the theft occurred.

853
00:48:14,392 --> 00:48:15,267
AUDIT REPORT

854
00:48:15,351 --> 00:48:17,436
Boiler performance,
quantity, hot water temperature,

855
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,855
number of hot water tubs,
hot water maintenance duration,

856
00:48:19,939 --> 00:48:22,691
and business hours
were considered in the calculations.

857
00:48:22,775 --> 00:48:25,778
These variables were organized
by each bathhouse,

858
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:29,240
and the total was calculated
using a formula developed with the victim.

859
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:32,576
Our client suffered
around 1.3 billion won in damages.

860
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:35,955
The same method was used
in other regions for theft as well.

861
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:37,915
If we combine all the damage suffered,

862
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:40,126
I believe it'll be around 3.8 billion won.

863
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:43,129
And the amount we calculated

864
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:45,756
assumes operation at maximum efficiency.

865
00:48:46,382 --> 00:48:48,634
But it's hard to maintain
such efficiency in real life,

866
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:51,637
so we suspect the actual amount
to be much higher.

867
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:56,392
Your Honor.

868
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:58,894
With the court's permission,
we'd like to submit

869
00:48:58,978 --> 00:49:01,313
the materials prepared
by the victim's counsel into evidence.

870
00:49:01,397 --> 00:49:03,732
Yes, let us hear it first.

871
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:06,402
As per the defense counsel's materials,

872
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:09,572
Gangdong City Gas suffered
about 1.3 billion won in damages.

873
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:12,283
- Wow…
- That is the estimate.

874
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:14,827
As this method
was also utilized in other regions,

875
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:17,830
we estimate the total damage suffered
to be around 3.8 billion won.

876
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:19,123
Did you say 3.8 billion won?

877
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:20,332
Yes, that is correct.

878
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:22,376
In light of the higher amount,

879
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,753
we request a harsher sentence
for the defendant.

880
00:49:24,837 --> 00:49:27,089
Wait, Your Honor! This is nonsense.

881
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:31,218
We are just a small business
trying to get by.

882
00:49:31,302 --> 00:49:33,471
We were just looking
to lower our gas bill a bit.

883
00:49:33,554 --> 00:49:35,848
I am aware that it was wrong,

884
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:40,311
but we made that unfortunate choice
because we were struggling to survive.

885
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:43,189
For a massive gas company
holding a supply monopoly

886
00:49:43,272 --> 00:49:45,858
to hire a major law firm like Yullim

887
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:49,737
to come down on powerless,
small business owners like us…

888
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,739
Isn't that just unfair?

889
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:54,408
Defendant, please try
to calm down and sit back down.

890
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:56,118
- Please sit down.
- My goodness.

891
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:04,168
Does the victim's counsel
have anything to add?

892
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:05,878
Yes, I do!

893
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:08,214
You don't need to shout.

894
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:10,216
Go ahead.

895
00:50:10,299 --> 00:50:11,425
Thank you.

896
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:14,011
May I step forward for a moment?

897
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:15,679
Yes, you may.

898
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:27,149
Your Honor,

899
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:29,485
the defendant is acting as if this case

900
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:32,905
is between a small business owner
and a giant gas company,

901
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:37,368
claiming to be the victim
of a classic power imbalance.

902
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,830
However, the victim, Gangdong City Gas,

903
00:50:41,914 --> 00:50:44,917
is comprised of ordinary citizens
working under conditions

904
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,835
even harsher than the defendant's.

905
00:50:46,919 --> 00:50:47,920
GANGDONG CITY GAS

906
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:50,047
<i>Through rain and snow,</i>

907
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:52,299
<i>through scorching summers</i>
<i>and bitter winters,</i>

908
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:55,010
<i>the meter readers visit every home</i>
<i>to check the meters.</i>

909
00:50:55,803 --> 00:50:57,304
<i>The engineers work through</i>

910
00:50:57,388 --> 00:51:00,808
<i>the stifling heat of the boiler room,</i>
<i>even in the middle of summer.</i>

911
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:04,478
<i>Someone's gain always comes</i>
<i>at someone else's expense.</i>

912
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:06,814
The damage suffered by the gas company

913
00:51:07,982 --> 00:51:11,485
became a burden that fell squarely
on actual small business owners.

914
00:51:11,569 --> 00:51:12,861
CLASSIC WHOLE FRIED CHICKEN

915
00:51:12,945 --> 00:51:13,821
Enjoy.

916
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:16,699
<i>Small business owners</i>
<i>who work hard every day</i>

917
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:18,492
<i>without stealing…</i>

918
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:21,912
Those struggling small business owners

919
00:51:21,996 --> 00:51:24,665
are the ones who deserve
to be protected by the law.

920
00:51:26,709 --> 00:51:28,252
- Hey! What are you doing?
- Hold on…

921
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:30,004
Defendant, please sit down.

922
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:31,672
Do not point fingers in court.

923
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:32,631
- Jeez!
- Just stop…

924
00:51:32,715 --> 00:51:34,174
- This is a sham trial.
- Stop…

925
00:51:34,258 --> 00:51:36,468
- It makes no sense.
- We don't want a public defender.

926
00:51:36,552 --> 00:51:38,846
We'll switch over to a major law firm.

927
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:39,847
Quiet down, Defendant.

928
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,223
- Sit down.
- This is nonsense!

929
00:51:41,307 --> 00:51:43,017
- What? 3.8 billion won?
- When did I ever…

930
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,019
I never stole that much.

931
00:51:45,394 --> 00:51:46,770
YULLIM
KANG HYO-MIN, LITIGATION

932
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:49,148
We'll be in touch.

933
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:50,941
- Okay.
- Thank you, Counsel.

934
00:51:59,325 --> 00:52:00,367
Hello, Ms. Kang.

935
00:52:00,868 --> 00:52:02,661
I'm from Asia City Gas.

936
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:04,997
I see.

937
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,583
We were hoping to retain you
for this case as well.

938
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:08,917
What do we need to do?

939
00:52:10,169 --> 00:52:11,045
Well…

940
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:14,465
I'm from Songju City Gas,
and we'd also like to retain you.

941
00:52:15,299 --> 00:52:16,592
Thank you in advance.

942
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:18,761
I'm from Seonam City Gas.

943
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:20,179
Please work on our case.

944
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:21,597
We'd really appreciate it.

945
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:22,973
Hello, I'm…

946
00:52:26,602 --> 00:52:28,103
That's amazing, Hyo-min.

947
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:30,814
- I did well, right?
- Yeah.

948
00:52:31,774 --> 00:52:33,108
That only makes it sting more.

949
00:52:33,192 --> 00:52:35,277
You should be with us, Lee & Seo.

950
00:52:35,361 --> 00:52:38,530
If word gets out you're good at your job,
you'll be swamped. That's trouble.

951
00:52:38,614 --> 00:52:39,490
Being busy is good.

952
00:52:40,616 --> 00:52:43,452
Maybe we should
just move in together now.

953
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:45,079
Don't be ridiculous.

954
00:52:45,788 --> 00:52:48,248
You were busy studying in law school.

955
00:52:48,332 --> 00:52:50,834
I thought we'd see each other
every day at Lee & Seo,

956
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:52,628
but you joined our competitor firm.

957
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:55,464
If you're good at your job on top of that,
late nights are guaranteed.

958
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:57,257
We'll hardly be able to go on dates.

959
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:59,677
I just joined Yullim.

960
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:02,221
Keep yourself busy while I settle in.

961
00:53:03,222 --> 00:53:04,682
You're always my top priority.

962
00:53:04,765 --> 00:53:07,351
When will I ever become yours?

963
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:08,352
Jeez…

964
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:13,023
Hello, Attorney Heo!

965
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:15,359
Hello, Attorney Han.

966
00:53:16,485 --> 00:53:18,070
How nice to run into you here.

967
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:19,655
Did you have dinner here?

968
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:21,031
Yes, with…

969
00:53:21,115 --> 00:53:22,866
the girl I'll be marrying soon.

970
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:23,909
"Marry"?

971
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:26,995
What splendid news.

972
00:53:27,663 --> 00:53:30,916
It's nice to meet you. Your name?

973
00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:31,917
I'm Kang--

974
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,544
She is Attorney Kang Hyo-min.

975
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:35,546
She just joined Yullim
as an entry-level attorney.

976
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:36,839
I see…

977
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:38,465
You're a lawyer.

978
00:53:38,549 --> 00:53:41,093
Yullim is also a great law firm.

979
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:42,094
Yes.

980
00:53:43,387 --> 00:53:45,848
She is Chief Judge
Kang Il-chan's only daughter.

981
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:50,185
So you're Judge Kang Il-chan's daughter.

982
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:54,732
Her mother is
Professor Choi Eun-hee at SNU Law.

983
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:57,609
My goodness,
what an amazing person you are.

984
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:02,322
Where in the world
did you meet this precious woman?

985
00:54:02,406 --> 00:54:04,158
You are just blessed beyond belief.

986
00:54:05,117 --> 00:54:07,911
I must have saved the country
in a past life.

987
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:27,181
Are you okay?

988
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:32,352
You seem a little down,

989
00:54:32,436 --> 00:54:33,812
and you've been quiet.

990
00:54:34,313 --> 00:54:35,814
I'm fine.

991
00:54:35,898 --> 00:54:38,233
What's wrong? Did I do something wrong?

992
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:42,613
Why do you like me?

993
00:54:44,907 --> 00:54:47,493
Is this because
of how I introduced you earlier?

994
00:54:47,576 --> 00:54:49,828
Do you think I like you
because of your background?

995
00:54:49,912 --> 00:54:50,996
I just…

996
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:52,122
Unbelievable.

997
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:54,291
Gosh, you and your girlish feelings.

998
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:57,336
Hyo-min.

999
00:54:57,419 --> 00:55:00,756
This might sound cold,
but "girlish" is just being polite.

1000
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:02,800
That's actually an immature mindset.

1001
00:55:02,883 --> 00:55:04,885
Well, if you're not careful,

1002
00:55:05,469 --> 00:55:08,305
you might come off as a bit smug,
like someone privileged showing off.

1003
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:10,516
Your background is a part of you.

1004
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:13,268
We're too old to be bitter
about someone benefiting from privilege.

1005
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:16,730
And to say it's shallow
to consider someone's background.

1006
00:55:17,773 --> 00:55:20,692
A marriage can't work with just emotions.

1007
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,778
Truth be told,

1008
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:27,199
your family background
and excellent genetics are included

1009
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:29,868
in the reasons why I love you.

1010
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:31,578
Hyo-min,

1011
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:34,790
I want to pass along
elite genes to my kids.

1012
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:38,752
Just thinking about my wife,
whom I can always be proud of,

1013
00:55:38,836 --> 00:55:41,338
and our kids, who will grow up
in comfort and care,

1014
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:43,674
makes me so emotional.

1015
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:48,095
I also like your "girlish" sentiments.

1016
00:55:52,558 --> 00:55:54,768
- I have something to tell you.
- Sure. Go ahead.

1017
00:55:56,103 --> 00:55:57,604
Not today. Later.

1018
00:55:58,856 --> 00:56:00,440
What? You're making me curious.

1019
00:56:35,684 --> 00:56:36,810
<i>Your dad's sleeping.</i>

1020
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:39,146
<i>Let's not bother him.</i>

1021
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,066
<i>Let's go, Hash.</i>

1022
00:56:56,288 --> 00:56:57,205
Are you awake?

1023
00:56:57,915 --> 00:56:58,916
Yeah.

1024
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:01,668
Should we have breakfast?

1025
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:04,922
What should I make?

1026
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:06,590
No, I'll make breakfast.

1027
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:08,592
Really?

1028
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:10,135
- Yeah.
- Like what?

1029
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:11,720
What do you want?

1030
00:57:12,346 --> 00:57:13,221
Me?

1031
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:15,265
Your lips.

1032
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:21,897
Hey, Hash.

1033
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:24,566
Hash, attack him with kisses.

1034
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:26,610
- Hey, Hash.
- There's Dad.

1035
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:28,445
- Yes, Hash.
- Give Dad a kiss.

1036
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:30,906
- My little puppy…
- Does it make you that happy?

1037
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:33,367
- Hash, aren't you sleepy?
- Hash.

1038
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,118
Goodness, Hash.

1039
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:39,581
<i>You like Dad the most, right?</i>

1040
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:49,257
What are you doing?

1041
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:55,514
I told you not to drink coffee at night.

1042
00:57:56,682 --> 00:57:57,724
It's fine.

1043
00:57:58,767 --> 00:57:59,935
I sleep perfectly fine.

1044
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:02,813
Were you watching Hash?

1045
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:05,440
Yes.

1046
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:08,652
I guess you miss Hash.

1047
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:12,698
Yeah.

1048
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:15,784
What about me?

1049
00:58:18,412 --> 00:58:19,371
I don't miss you.

1050
00:58:21,248 --> 00:58:22,374
Liar.

1051
00:59:25,604 --> 00:59:28,857
BEYOND THE BAR

1052
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:31,109
<i>Where's Mr. Yoon rushing off to?</i>

1053
00:59:31,193 --> 00:59:33,737
- He gets off work early on Fridays.
- Why?

1054
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,572
- To pick his kid up.
- A kid?

1055
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:38,283
Kang Hyo-min, my darling,

1056
00:59:39,868 --> 00:59:41,203
will you marry me?

1057
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:43,830
<i>I entrusted my sperm</i>
<i>to Hoseon Fertility Clinic,</i>

1058
00:59:43,914 --> 00:59:46,458
<i>and those bastards destroyed</i>
<i>my precious sperm by mistake.</i>

1059
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:48,794
<i>We need something big</i>
<i>to turn the tables.</i>

1060
00:59:48,877 --> 00:59:51,213
<i>We haven't found it yet,</i>

1061
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:52,255
so until then, we bluff.

1062
00:59:52,339 --> 00:59:53,757
Can you handle the consequences?

1063
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:58,386
<i>If I'm at a disadvantage in the ring,</i>
<i>I take it outside and finish it there.</i>

1064
00:59:59,513 --> 01:00:01,098
<i>I found the game changer.</i>

1065
01:00:01,807 --> 01:00:04,643
And we're claiming
500 million won in damages.

1066
01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:06,561
<i>Let's have a word.</i>

1067
01:00:07,479 --> 01:00:09,439
Do you think that makes any sense?

1068
01:00:09,523 --> 01:00:13,485
In a lawsuit, it's not about who wins.
It's about who gets hurt less.

1069
01:00:22,786 --> 01:00:23,954
KANG HYO-MIN

1070
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:43,682
- Don't take Hyo-ju away.
- Hyo-min.

1071
01:00:43,765 --> 01:00:48,019
Don't take Hyo-ju away.

1072
01:00:56,528 --> 01:00:58,530
