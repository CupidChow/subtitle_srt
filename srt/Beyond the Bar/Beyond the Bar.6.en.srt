1
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:35,953
BEYOND THE BAR

2
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,403
What are you doing?

3
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,158
What's with this woman?

4
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:40,535
Who is she?

5
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:46,249
Stop it.

6
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,460
Who the hell is this nutjob?

7
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,212
Let's go.

8
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,963
Wait. Let me call the cops.

9
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:53,840
Let's just go. Okay?

10
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,667
If it's too hard to talk about it now,
we can wait--

11
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,421
I broke up with someone I loved.

12
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,008
We were together for eight months,

13
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:41,388
and it's been three months
since the breakup.

14
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:42,848
I see.

15
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:46,059
He already has a new girlfriend.

16
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,562
I loved him a lot.

17
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:50,647
So…

18
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:53,900
it's been really hard on me.

19
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:55,694
Right.

20
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:03,535
I want to sue my ex-boyfriend.

21
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:07,539
I get that you're upset about the breakup,

22
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:11,918
but you can't press criminal
or civil charges without legal grounds.

23
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:16,256
I'm sorry you're hurting from the breakup,

24
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,468
but the damage isn't
something the law can compensate for,

25
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:22,137
so I'm afraid there's nothing
I can help you with.

26
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:42,657
My ex-boyfriend did this to me.

27
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:43,658
Pardon?

28
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,584
I want to sue him.

29
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:05,847
LOVE IS AN IMPAIRMENT

30
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,280
Be extra careful
not to irritate the wound.

31
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:26,034
You have keloid-prone skin,

32
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:29,204
so whenever you get injured,
the scars tend to rise up

33
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,540
and spread beyond the original wound.

34
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:35,418
You have sensitive skin
that reacts even to small wounds.

35
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:43,134
With normal skin, this would have healed
without leaving a scar.

36
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:47,055
But because your skin
forms aggressive keloids,

37
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,140
it left noticeable scars like this.

38
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:54,104
Will the scars go away if I get treatment?

39
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,857
Keloid scars are
very difficult to get rid of.

40
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,277
This injection is
the only way to help reduce it.

41
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:02,612
If I treated it surgically--

42
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,781
No, that will make it worse.

43
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:08,368
Because the surgical scars
will likely form keloids too.

44
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,248
Is there no other way?

45
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,542
I work as a model,

46
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,003
but I can't model anymore
because of these scars.

47
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,172
Gosh…

48
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,562
Since time is money for everyone here,

49
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,355
I'll keep this short.

50
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:40,442
I've gathered you
for an important announcement.

51
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,319
As of today, I'll be retired

52
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,279
but staying on as an advisor.

53
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,198
What's going on here?

54
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:49,409
Now, I'd like to introduce my successor,

55
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:53,830
our new managing partner.

56
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:55,957
Ms. Kwon Na-yeon.

57
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,293
Please step up.

58
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,253
The attorney whose name
is a brand in itself?

59
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,055
Kwon Na-yeon?

60
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,139
I've never seen her.

61
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:13,725
She was assigned
to DA Solutions, remember?

62
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:14,935
DA Solutions?

63
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:17,187
It's a tiny company
out in the middle of nowhere.

64
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,357
Assigned? She just got sidelined
because of office politics.

65
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,776
What a triumphant return.

66
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,696
The inauguration
and my retirement ceremony

67
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,115
will be held tomorrow at 2:00 p.m.

68
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:34,621
This will be a historic moment.
The first time a major Korean law firm

69
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:39,209
will be led by a woman in her forties
who is not a graduate of SNU Law.

70
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,629
Your presence at this historic moment

71
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,506
would be greatly appreciated.

72
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:45,966
Thank you.

73
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:50,720
Hey, it's the rainmaker.

74
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,389
Hey, watch what you say.

75
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,395
YULLIM APPOINTS FIRST FEMALE
MANAGING PARTNER IN HER FORTIES

76
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:01,940
Mr. Ko!

77
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,692
You didn't even consult me on this.

78
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:04,651
Take a seat.

79
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,277
Why Kwon Na-yeon…

80
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:07,654
What on earth are you thinking?

81
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,240
Don't get worked up. Sit.

82
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,866
Are you really retiring?

83
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,535
Why not stay for about five more years

84
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:14,828
and hand me the baton--

85
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,705
- Hand you the baton?
- I…

86
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,623
And if I do,

87
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,458
will anyone follow you?

88
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:21,418
Sorry?

89
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:26,006
A law firm isn't like a corporation.

90
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,509
You can't just transfer
management rights like that.

91
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,678
A law firm is a partnership.

92
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:35,515
Which one of the partners here
would follow you like they follow me?

93
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,767
But… Father.

94
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:41,771
Besides, why would you want to be
the captain of a sinking ship anyway?

95
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:44,733
I asked you to warn
Yoon Seok-hoon to stay in line.

96
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:46,860
How could you side with him?

97
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,821
You brought back his mentor
who we worked so hard to get rid of--

98
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,573
The world has changed.

99
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,285
It's time law firms competed
based on expertise.

100
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,413
How long are we going to let
those dinosaurs keep getting cases

101
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:01,124
through personal ties
instead of actual skill?

102
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,792
Can you get your hands dirty?

103
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:03,960
Can you do that?

104
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:11,426
You see,

105
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,887
we watch from behind, hands folded,

106
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,598
while those hatchet men
swing their swords.

107
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,559
And when the chaos dies down,
we chop their heads off

108
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:22,687
and gracefully step
onto the newly arranged playing field

109
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:24,898
and just keep doing what we've been doing.

110
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,024
Sorry?

111
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,901
They're just

112
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:29,986
our tools.

113
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:30,945
Just hatchet men.

114
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,281
But…

115
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:35,325
They…

116
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,495
Kwon Na-yeon and Yoon Seok-hoon
are not people we can mess with.

117
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,954
They're not.

118
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:41,623
That's why I gave them the swords.

119
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:42,582
Then

120
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,877
how will you chop their heads off
once they're done?

121
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:50,548
Who do you think they'll target first?

122
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:52,926
Those overpaid
former judges and prosecutors

123
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,261
and advisors who can't land any clients.

124
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:59,474
Who would follow a hatchet man
who swung their sword at them?

125
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:02,727
What's a law firm again?

126
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:06,314
- Part…
- Yes, partnership.

127
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:09,400
A leader who hasn't earned
the respect of the partners

128
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:11,402
can never truly lead.

129
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:15,573
<i>Sadist?</i>

130
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,201
So?

131
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,912
As it turns out, Ms. Seol Eun-yeong

132
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:23,957
has keloid-prone skin,
which reacts severely to injuries.

133
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,127
What wouldn't leave a mark
on someone with normal skin,

134
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,337
such as sexual activity,

135
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,048
left keloidal scarring in Ms. Seol's case,
which gradually spread

136
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,259
and has now become quite unsightly.

137
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,177
On top of everything,

138
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,638
she's a model.

139
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:42,183
That's rough.

140
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:43,226
But

141
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,354
if the client did not consent
to the sadistic act,

142
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,273
it could constitute assault.

143
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,274
That's right.

144
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:50,900
I actually asked her that.

145
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:53,778
She said he made her sign
a consent form before sex,

146
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:55,864
like some kind of ritual.

147
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:57,448
How thorough.

148
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:58,992
How about alcohol?

149
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,077
If she was intoxicated at the time
she gave consent,

150
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:03,663
we could argue she lacked capacity,
so the consent wouldn't hold.

151
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,415
I asked her that too,

152
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,376
but she can't drink at all,
so that never happened.

153
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:09,711
This is difficult.

154
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,797
To establish assault,

155
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:16,342
we'd have to argue
that the consent was not valid.

156
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:19,846
Why is that?

157
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,766
What does the validity of consent
have to do with assault?

158
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,768
Jeez, you scared me.

159
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:29,147
If I were to flick
your forehead right now,

160
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,106
would that be assault?

161
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,649
Of course.

162
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:35,195
Then what if we both agreed
to a forehead flick if we lost a game?

163
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:36,905
- That's not assault.
- Why not?

164
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:40,533
I don't know.

165
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:43,328
What about boxing?
They hit each other. Isn't that assault?

166
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,079
That's not assault.

167
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:46,372
Why not?

168
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:48,416
Because it's a sport.

169
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:51,502
In principle, the act itself
constitutes assault,

170
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:53,922
but because the other party consented,

171
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:55,840
it doesn't amount to a crime.

172
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:00,303
Say you were a victim of school violence

173
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:03,139
and only agreed to the forehead flick game

174
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:06,476
out of fear of retaliation.
Would that consent still be valid?

175
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,229
That's not genuine consent,
so it's assault.

176
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:10,313
Exactly.

177
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,565
For consent to negate
the unlawfulness of the act,

178
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:15,944
it must be given by the victim
while in a state capable of making

179
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:16,945
a voluntary decision.

180
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:18,947
A straightforward example would be

181
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,699
someone signing a contract
while under the influence of drugs,

182
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:25,328
under hypnosis,
or with a knife pointed at them.

183
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:28,790
That can't be considered
genuine consent, so--

184
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,501
It can't be regarded
as a valid expression of consent.

185
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:34,003
So that's why it constitutes assault.

186
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:34,963
Exactly.

187
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:38,758
There was written consent,

188
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:41,219
but there may be room
to argue one key point…

189
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:44,973
- Which is?
- Ms. Seol was in love.

190
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,893
Therefore, she was in a state
of diminished capacity.

191
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,436
What?

192
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,648
Can't we say love is
a form of diminished capacity too?

193
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,403
You never disappoint.

194
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,405
How creative. Good job, Hyo-min.

195
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:03,491
That's the funniest thing
I've heard recently.

196
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:05,243
Hear me out.

197
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,745
When we fall in love,
we all lose a bit of judgment

198
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:08,913
and become irrational.

199
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:11,082
You've all been in love, right?

200
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,002
Let's say you're at the beach in winter,

201
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:17,130
and the woman you love says,
"If you love me, jump in."

202
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:20,133
Jumping into the sea
in the middle of a freezing winter…

203
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,802
There's nothing rational
or normal about that, is there?

204
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:27,098
Come to think of it,

205
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:30,143
my high school girlfriend
was kind of a perv.

206
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,645
One time she was chewing
this super juicy gum,

207
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:35,523
and then she spat out her saliva
into a cup and said,

208
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:37,900
"Drink it

209
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:40,111
if you want to date me."

210
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,322
- So I…
- So you what?

211
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:44,032
I drank it.

212
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:45,241
Jeez.

213
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,285
It makes me sick now,

214
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,120
but back then,

215
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:52,623
I was able do it because I was in love.

216
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:55,460
Love can impair your mind
and body to the point

217
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,920
where rational judgment
becomes impossible.

218
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:01,007
So if the consent was given
under diminished capacity,

219
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,300
it's not legally valid,

220
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,677
and that makes it assault.

221
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:07,221
Your argument doesn't make any sense,

222
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:09,724
but it kind of makes sense
at the same time.

223
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:19,233
No way.

224
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:23,112
Are you seriously thinking
of going with this absurd argument?

225
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,031
Since an assault charge requires

226
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,742
grounds to invalidate the consent,

227
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:31,496
we have no choice but to consider
Ms. Kang's argument more thoroughly.

228
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,915
Why not just drop the case?

229
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,334
We're drowning in work
because the whole universe knows

230
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,960
how good you are.

231
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:40,546
Is it really necessary
to take on a case like this?

232
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,048
It's intriguing.

233
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,676
Why do you think the Anglo-American
legal system is so developed?

234
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,719
I'm not sure.

235
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:50,556
They file lawsuits
for tripping over a rock

236
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,352
or for getting cancer
after years of chain smoking.

237
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,187
That gives courts

238
00:14:56,896 --> 00:15:01,150
a chance to think through legal principles
more creatively and in broader contexts.

239
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:04,987
Over time, precedents build up,
reducing legal uncertainty.

240
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:09,367
As a result, legal predictability
and trust in court rulings increase.

241
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:12,078
People come to rely on the law

242
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,956
rather than keeping their problems

243
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,666
to themselves.

244
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,293
That's the start of a virtuous cycle.

245
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:20,920
I see.

246
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,548
I think it's worth trying too.

247
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:27,093
Genuine consent must be voluntary.

248
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,387
If consent was given
under psychological pressure,

249
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,097
then it can't be considered legally valid.

250
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:35,268
We can probably look into whether
she felt pressured when she agreed.

251
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:38,980
There was a case in the US in which
a woman claimed to have been raped,

252
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:44,485
arguing that her consent
to a seemingly consensual sexual encounter

253
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:47,321
was the result of psychological
and economic pressure.

254
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:49,907
Let's work on this case.

255
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:50,908
Okay, Mr. Yoon.

256
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:04,672
Yes.

257
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:05,798
Come in.

258
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:08,301
This is our new client
in the divorce case…

259
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,343
What are you doing here?

260
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,181
Do you two know each other?

261
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:14,474
It's been a while.

262
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:17,518
I said, what are you doing here?

263
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:20,688
What's going on?

264
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:26,402
I'm sorry, but would you
mind giving us a moment?

265
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,033
Sure.

266
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,368
I can do that.

267
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:46,547
I almost didn't recognize you.

268
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,841
Had we bumped
into each other on the street,

269
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:51,469
- I would have walked right past you.
- Cut to the chase.

270
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:54,263
I'm divorcing him.

271
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:55,431
And?

272
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:56,766
I'll probably sue him.

273
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:57,892
And?

274
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,394
Please take my case.

275
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:01,479
Seriously?

276
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,898
- Min-jeong--
- Don't "Min-jeong" me.

277
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:09,570
You're the perfect person
for this case, Ms. Heo.

278
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,114
I saw people praising you

279
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:15,117
as the top divorce attorney
on a support forum for moms,

280
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:16,911
so I checked your profile.

281
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:20,289
But at the time,
I never imagined it would be you.

282
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:24,669
I was going to let it go
when I found out it was you.

283
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,379
But then I thought

284
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,549
you'd understand me better than anyone--

285
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:32,510
How would I understand
what it's like to be a mistress?

286
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,804
You were wronged by his family

287
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,514
and by him.

288
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:39,183
The same thing happened to me.

289
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,729
You reap what you sow.
Justice has prevailed.

290
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,444
Don't ever come here again.

291
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,115
Don't go dragging someone through the mud

292
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,784
when they've wiped their past clean.

293
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,492
That was nice.

294
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:43,164
Heavens. Just look at her.

295
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,208
No wonder she's getting fat.

296
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:47,168
You!

297
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,962
We'll go broke at this rate. Stop eating!

298
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,381
- At this hour?
- Yes, Mother.

299
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,800
It reeks of food in here.

300
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:56,677
Gosh, I'm getting a headache.

301
00:18:56,761 --> 00:19:01,849
No wonder my son is never home!
It's all because of you!

302
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:05,436
My poor son.

303
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:09,148
I don't know how he ended up
getting involved with someone like you.

304
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,525
You got pregnant without a plan

305
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:16,030
and used that as an excuse
to tie my son down!

306
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,365
And now…

307
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:27,583
APPLICATION FOR CONFIRMATION
OF AGREEMENT TO DIVORCE

308
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,001
CHOI DAE-WON
HEO MIN-JEONG

309
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:30,836
Sign it.

310
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:35,633
Whatever.

311
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:38,594
She's moving in.

312
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:41,514
Stay if that's what you want.

313
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:46,727
I'll do better.

314
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,356
Let's not do this.

315
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:54,276
For So-hyeon's sake,
let's forget about this.

316
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,279
Don't use me as your excuse.
Just get a divorce!

317
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,991
That's what I want,
and that's what's best for me.

318
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,300
Ms. Heo.

319
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,930
Min-jeong.

320
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:24,724
Yes?

321
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:26,684
What's on your mind? Didn't you hear me?

322
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:28,644
It's nothing. What is it?

323
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:32,398
They want us in the conference room.
It's Ms. Kwon Na-yeon's inauguration.

324
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,191
Right. Let's go.

325
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:37,987
Hurry.

326
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,197
INAUGURATION OF
MANAGING PARTNER KWON NA-YEON

327
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:41,657
Yullim is lost

328
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:44,869
and adrift at the moment.

329
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:47,747
But it is okay.

330
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:51,292
The great writer Goethe once said,

331
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:55,921
"Man errs so long as he strives."

332
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,549
To err means

333
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,509
you have a goal.

334
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:04,388
It's proof that there is a point
you're trying to reach.

335
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:06,724
An organization that no longer struggles

336
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:09,769
and settles into complacency
and stagnation

337
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:14,231
is as good as dead.

338
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:17,485
Our goal is clear.

339
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,446
A law firm that earns trust with expertise

340
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:23,157
and wins through excellence.

341
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,326
It's time for Yullim

342
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,244
to pursue sustainable growth

343
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:30,706
through professional expertise.

344
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:33,292
We must choose competence over indulgence

345
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,336
and expertise

346
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,046
over connections.

347
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:42,843
This is the path that Yullim must follow.

348
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:46,514
Let us move forward together

349
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,809
towards Yullim's new future!

350
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,742
Let me know if you need anything.

351
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:07,701
I will.

352
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:10,621
It's been a while.

353
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:13,499
I really enjoyed your speech.

354
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,376
Did you?

355
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:18,671
The comment about indulgence
and connections

356
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,297
wasn't directed at you, Mr. Ko.

357
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:22,383
I know that.

358
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:23,926
Tell me.

359
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,345
What does it feel like to return in glory?

360
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:29,807
Thanks to you,
I had some truly amazing experiences.

361
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,016
Wasn't it over too soon?

362
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,935
I wish you'd stayed there
a few more years.

363
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,896
It's only right that such a position
should go to you, Mr. Ko.

364
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,022
I'm good here.

365
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:39,567
I've learned a lot thanks to you.

366
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:42,361
I'll make sure to pay you back.

367
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:43,487
You will?

368
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:44,947
I look forward to that.

369
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:51,871
You're a professional, aren't you?

370
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:54,915
Are you not aware of who your client is?

371
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:56,959
Your client, Ms. Kwon,

372
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,295
is Hynic Core Inc.,

373
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,298
not its CEO, Lee Seong-bin.

374
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:07,344
Of course, a company's CEO
may identify themselves with the company.

375
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:09,597
That is, when one
does not have legal knowledge.

376
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,140
How could a lawyer

377
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,933
possibly be unaware

378
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:16,103
that a company and its representative

379
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,396
are legally separate entities?

380
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:18,898
I am aware.

381
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:22,735
But if CEO Lee Seong-bin goes down,
so does Hynic Core.

382
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:25,029
Who are you to make that judgment call?

383
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:26,780
Mr. Ko.

384
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:31,035
Tell me.
Do you really need to take it this far?

385
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:32,995
This is embezzlement in a technical sense,

386
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,706
but it's not like Mr. Lee
actually stole any money.

387
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:37,166
With the right legal advice--

388
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:40,920
We're saying such legal advice
is a conflict of interest.

389
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:43,964
If you're so eager
to personally represent Lee Seong-bin,

390
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:47,009
then leave Yullim,
open your own office in Seocho-dong,

391
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,052
and go ahead.

392
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,470
No one is stopping you.

393
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:52,181
These days, even lawyers in Seocho-dong

394
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,767
are setting up joint offices
with separate-account systems…

395
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,394
SEPARATE-ACCOUNT SYSTEMS
EACH ATTORNEY HANDLES THEIR OWN FINANCES

396
00:23:57,478 --> 00:23:58,938
…and calling them law firms.

397
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:01,982
Why don't you go join them?
She'd fit right in, wouldn't she?

398
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,905
<i>They brought down</i>

399
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:10,032
an entire company just to force me out.

400
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:13,160
They're capable of anything.

401
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:16,497
- Yes.
- An eye for an eye, right?

402
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,040
Right.

403
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,126
They'll make the first move.

404
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:24,129
The priority is keeping Yullim alive.

405
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:27,174
Let's start with the restructuring.

406
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:28,217
Definitely.

407
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:33,597
Diminished capacity?

408
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,140
Yes.

409
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:38,185
Can love also constitute
diminished capacity?

410
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:43,357
The only argument we can make
is that the consent wasn't valid,

411
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,442
which means you'd have to claim

412
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:48,570
you weren't
mentally competent at the time.

413
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:50,739
I see.

414
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:53,117
So we have a few questions to ask.

415
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,576
Sure.

416
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:57,621
Do you have masochistic tendencies?

417
00:24:57,705 --> 00:24:58,914
Masochistic?

418
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,542
What is that?

419
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,210
A masochist

420
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:07,423
is someone who gets sexually aroused
by pain or being abused--

421
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:08,590
No.

422
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:10,384
Not at all.

423
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,928
Are there people who like that?

424
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:17,891
Then why did you give consent?

425
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,602
I refused at first.

426
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:22,229
But then,

427
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:24,940
he wanted to break up with me.

428
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:27,860
That's why we broke up,

429
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,486
but I missed him.

430
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:32,031
A lot.

431
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:35,492
I couldn't even last a week
and ended up reaching out to him.

432
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:36,452
But…

433
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,581
he wouldn't take me back.

434
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:44,043
For a whole month,

435
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,462
I would call him like crazy,

436
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:48,464
I would show up unannounced,

437
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:51,425
I would break down in tears,
and make a scene.

438
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:56,346
I never imagined that someone
who was so kind and devoted to me

439
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,809
could also be so cold.

440
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:04,605
The sense of loss and emptiness
was so overwhelming,

441
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,107
I could barely function.

442
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:12,696
About a month later,

443
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,907
he reached out to me.

444
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:17,785
That's how we got back together.

445
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:21,371
I felt like

446
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:24,166
I had the whole world in my hands.

447
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:27,544
He must have demanded sadistic sex again.

448
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:29,880
Yes.

449
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:32,508
Were you aware

450
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:35,636
that you have

451
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:36,929
keloid-prone skin?

452
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:39,264
Of course I was.

453
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:42,684
I've dreamed of being a model
since I was a little girl,

454
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:45,771
so I've always been careful,

455
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,065
scared of irritating
even a small paper cut.

456
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:51,568
Are you saying you gave consent
despite knowing all that?

457
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:53,904
I know it sounds crazy,

458
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,115
but I had…

459
00:26:58,325 --> 00:26:59,952
no choice back then.

460
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:02,830
Just the thought of him leaving me again…

461
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:06,542
I felt like I was gonna die
just thinking about it.

462
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:15,050
As Ms. Kang Hyo-min said,

463
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,428
the chances of winning this case are slim.

464
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:20,681
If you still want to proceed,

465
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:24,935
then we need to frame you
clearly as the victim.

466
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:27,813
As someone so weak and incapable

467
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:30,399
that you couldn't even
give legally valid consent.

468
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,194
This alone could be painful.

469
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:37,156
Is that how you see me?

470
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:38,907
I'm sorry,

471
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,744
but judging by your story, yes.

472
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,874
I think love made you that way.

473
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:51,378
You were
in that diminished state we call love,

474
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:53,297
a state that anyone can fall into.

475
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:57,050
And unfortunately, you met someone
who took advantage of that.

476
00:27:57,593 --> 00:27:59,261
Do you…

477
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:01,930
I mean,

478
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:04,808
does it also happen

479
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:06,810
to someone like you?

480
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,147
Yes.

481
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:14,902
The more I love,
the more vulnerable I become.

482
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:17,905
In the face of love,

483
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:22,075
everyone becomes irrational and weak.

484
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:26,413
So love and vulnerability
always go hand in hand.

485
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,841
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

486
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:39,176
Happy birthday.

487
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:48,185
It takes a birthday for us
to come to a place like this.

488
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:55,234
What the heck? He's so handsome.

489
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:57,069
He really is.

490
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,737
Look how he's surrounded by women.

491
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:01,698
If only there were fewer of them…

492
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:03,533
Go on.

493
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,452
Go and wipe them out.

494
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,412
Forget it.

495
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:09,831
The handsome ones are always trouble.

496
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:11,541
That's right.

497
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:14,544
He's more your type, Hyo-min.

498
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:16,546
What?

499
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:17,923
You're into those kinds of guys.

500
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,719
Not at all.

501
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:28,809
Thank you.

502
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:34,815
I'm sorry.

503
00:29:35,983 --> 00:29:36,858
It's fine.

504
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,362
You spilled your drinks.

505
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:42,364
Let me get you some new ones.

506
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:43,740
That's fine.

507
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:45,701
It was my fault.

508
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,160
Some of it was mine too.

509
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:52,249
Give her the same drinks,

510
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:54,501
and I'll get a gin and tonic, please.

511
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:55,502
Okay.

512
00:30:08,015 --> 00:30:09,141
What's going on?

513
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:10,851
No way.

514
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:16,315
- Shall I put them here?
- Yes, thank you.

515
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:22,237
He said he'd bring them for me

516
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:24,364
because I already spilled them once.

517
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,576
That's so kind of you.

518
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,369
Please. Take a seat.

519
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,331
Should I?

520
00:30:37,044 --> 00:30:38,211
Are you here alone?

521
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:39,629
Yes.

522
00:30:39,713 --> 00:30:42,215
I saw you hanging out
with a lot of people over there.

523
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,803
It's what you do… at bars.

524
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:51,350
- Should we make toast?
- Sure.

525
00:31:00,067 --> 00:31:01,860
I've decided to let all that go.

526
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,153
You have?

527
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:06,782
Wait, what do you do exactly?

528
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:09,409
How can someone look this good,
be this interesting,

529
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:10,702
and still be so charming?

530
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:12,037
I make mobile games.

531
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,497
Are you a programmer?

532
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,915
No, I'm the CEO.

533
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,876
Oh, you're a CEO.

534
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:21,380
Don't tell me you're the CEO
of the top company in the industry.

535
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:22,798
What's the top company?

536
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:27,219
Marble Soft, Horizon, Ruma Entertainment?

537
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:28,428
Thank you

538
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,138
for mentioning my company first.

539
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,474
I run Marble Soft.

540
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:33,517
That's my company.

541
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,313
What's your name?

542
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:41,066
Jung Han-seok.

543
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:45,028
<i>Who is your ex-boyfriend?</i>

544
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:50,075
Jung Han-seok,
the CEO of Marble Soft.

545
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:52,536
Marble Soft.

546
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:56,039
No wonder.
I knew you weren't an ordinary person.

547
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,251
I read about you in an article.
You really are something.

548
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:00,710
Thank you.

549
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:04,506
Can you tell me about yourselves?

550
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:07,634
Sure. I'm Han Seol-a, and I'm a doctor.

551
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:09,970
I'm 28.

552
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:11,721
I'm two years older than you.

553
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:13,723
We're all the same age.

554
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:15,392
We're childhood friends.

555
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:16,852
You guys go way back.

556
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:21,314
We've lived together since college,
so we're roommates too.

557
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:23,692
- I see.
- This is Lee Ji-eun.

558
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:26,278
- She's a lyricist.
- Are you?

559
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:27,571
What songs have you written?

560
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:29,948
Nothing too famous.

561
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:31,575
Humility isn't really a virtue nowadays.

562
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:33,743
She's written a lot of famous songs.

563
00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:35,162
Right.

564
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,460
I'm most curious about you.

565
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:45,589
I already know
that you're two years younger than me.

566
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:47,632
What's your name?

567
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:52,679
Kang Hyo-min.

568
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:53,763
Kang Hyo-min.

569
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:55,765
Kang Hyo-min.

570
00:32:57,267 --> 00:32:58,351
What do you do, Hyo-min?

571
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:02,147
I just…

572
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:03,773
She's a lawyer.

573
00:33:03,857 --> 00:33:05,066
Really?

574
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,902
She's a hotshot at a big law firm.

575
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:10,614
You don't look like a lawyer,

576
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,950
but you definitely have the aura of one.

577
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:20,248
What are you thinking about so deeply?

578
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:21,416
Sorry?

579
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:28,131
I haven't been a lawyer for long,

580
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,676
so I'm not sure
I have much of an aura yet.

581
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:34,638
A first-year?
That makes sense considering your age.

582
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,520
I bet you'd look prettier

583
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:43,522
if you let your hair down.

584
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,193
Try letting it down.

585
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,612
Trust me on this. Go on.

586
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:54,366
Wait.

587
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:07,504
You look so pretty.

588
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:23,728
Come in.

589
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:28,108
I'm here too.

590
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:30,068
Come on in.

591
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:33,488
Wow, your office is nice.

592
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:36,283
It looks much more spacious
without so much stuff in it.

593
00:34:36,366 --> 00:34:37,909
How's it going?

594
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,203
I still feel a little dazed.

595
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:43,873
Where I was dispatched to,
I didn't even have an office.

596
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:44,833
Right.

597
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:48,712
An in-house counsel at a mid-sized company
couldn't possibly have an office.

598
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:51,131
- Take a seat.
- Sure.

599
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:52,465
Here.

600
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:54,634
What is this?

601
00:34:54,718 --> 00:34:56,386
It's the data
for the restructuring process.

602
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,847
The employees subject
to the restructuring measures are marked

603
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,808
based on their sales
or performance in the past five years.

604
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:04,686
Mostly senior advisors
and former officials, I see.

605
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,938
Yes. We need to go through
with the restructuring first--

606
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:10,942
A law firm's rank is based on its revenue
and the number of lawyers, isn't it?

607
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:15,280
Isn't the real issue
not that they're still at the firm,

608
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:17,699
but that their pay throws off the balance?

609
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:20,535
Then it needs re-alignment.

610
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,622
We just need to change the bonus system.

611
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,081
That's right.

612
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:27,792
Given the choice between
a pay cut and leaving,

613
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:29,836
they'd choose the pay cut.

614
00:35:30,587 --> 00:35:34,007
What really matters to them
is social status and a sense of belonging.

615
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:36,134
They're not the ones

616
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,553
who actually need to leave.

617
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,555
There are others.

618
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,521
Yes?

619
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:51,483
Yul-seong.

620
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,234
Come in.

621
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:56,363
No.

622
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:59,616
You're a managing partner now.
I should be more polite.

623
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:01,618
Just treat me like usual.

624
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:03,953
To you, I probably
still look like a first-year.

625
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:05,705
No way.

626
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:06,748
That's not true.

627
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,333
Please. Take a seat, Ms. Kwon.

628
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:16,091
So you're curious

629
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:19,844
why Seung-cheol made you
a managing partner

630
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:22,847
when you were previously sidelined
due to office politics.

631
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:23,932
Yes.

632
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:27,102
I thought you might know something,

633
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,270
since you've known Mr. Ko for a long time.

634
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:34,567
I mean, I've been following Seung-cheol
around since college.

635
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:37,070
Still, I don't know
everything that's on his mind.

636
00:36:38,238 --> 00:36:39,739
One thing's for sure.

637
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:42,492
He doesn't just look at the person.

638
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:45,161
He looks at the ripple effect they create.

639
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,205
The ripple effect?

640
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:49,457
He probably put you in this position

641
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:51,501
not just for the ripple you'd create,

642
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:54,129
but for the momentum it would build
and the outdated structures

643
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,588
it would eventually break down.

644
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:57,507
He never holds the sword himself.

645
00:36:58,133 --> 00:36:59,843
He just calculates how it will swing.

646
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:04,222
Isn't that a little risky, then?

647
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:07,475
Someone more political

648
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:10,186
and easier to manage
would probably be better than me.

649
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:14,107
But someone like that
can't change the system.

650
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:17,318
They're too flexible.
They bend to fit the mold.

651
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:20,822
The way I see it, you're not the sword.
You're the one who wields it.

652
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:23,283
Someone who swings
the sword their own way.

653
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:26,703
So go ahead and swing it
in your own style.

654
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:28,455
Make it count.

655
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:31,624
Should I?

656
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:40,592
"As the consent is not legally valid,
the offense of assault applies."

657
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:42,927
Seriously?

658
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,388
Is this worth responding to?

659
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:47,974
Well,

660
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:50,059
legally speaking,
I don't think we would lose.

661
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:53,104
It is a very provocative issue,
so it might create unnecessary noise.

662
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:54,105
Right.

663
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:57,650
I can't allow my personal tastes
to become gossip for others.

664
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:01,738
We'll start with a meeting
between the lawyers

665
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:03,531
and try to settle things there.

666
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:04,783
Please do that.

667
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:08,661
I'm sorry to trouble you
with something so personal.

668
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:10,914
Not at all. Don't mention it.

669
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:14,417
You are Marble Soft,
and Marble Soft is you.

670
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:16,669
This kind of personal litigation
isn't entirely personal.

671
00:38:16,753 --> 00:38:18,797
With the IPO coming up,
we can't afford any noise.

672
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,089
A COMPANY'S FIRST STOCK LISTING

673
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:25,011
Who's representing the plaintiff?

674
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:27,931
It's Mr. Yoon Seok-hoon
and Ms. Kang Hyo-min from Yullim.

675
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:30,016
Kang Hyo-min?

676
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:31,976
Did you just say Kang Hyo-min?

677
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:32,977
Yes.

678
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:34,729
Let me see the complaint.

679
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,653
What's wrong?

680
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:43,863
Interesting.

681
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:52,747
COMPLAINT
ATTORNEYS YOON SEOK-HOON, KANG HYO-MIN

682
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:54,791
The recourse claim lawsuit
has been resolved,

683
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:58,711
and the Labor Office's administrative
hearing has been set for next month.

684
00:38:58,795 --> 00:39:00,129
- Okay.
- Yes.

685
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:02,423
Ms. Kang Hyo-min.

686
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,761
Ms. Kang?

687
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,805
What are you doing?

688
00:39:09,556 --> 00:39:10,473
Yes.

689
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:13,935
Is the claim that love impairs judgment
shaping up well?

690
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:16,187
Yes.

691
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:18,439
Give it your best shot.

692
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:20,108
I will.

693
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:23,611
- If that's everything, let's wrap it up.
- Okay.

694
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:25,446
Mr. Yoon.

695
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:31,953
Not that I'm comparing or anything,

696
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,247
but the antitrust law
and the financial law teams

697
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:37,584
have already had three team dinners.

698
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:42,422
Are we not going to have one?

699
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:43,673
Mr. Ji.

700
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:49,679
I have something important to do today,
so I'll leave you my credit card.

701
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:53,349
Still, it's our first get-together.
Why don't you join us?

702
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:55,602
I'll join if work allows.

703
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:57,103
Okay. Thank you.

704
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:58,563
Is there a limit on the card?

705
00:39:58,646 --> 00:39:59,772
Of course not.

706
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,528
Didn't know you had it in you!

260,000 WON, BEAR PUB

716
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:26,401
Jeez, they drank a lot.

717
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,111
Mr. Hwang,

718
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:30,238
is Bear Pub nearby?

719
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,031
We're about to pass it.

720
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:33,825
Can you head that way?

721
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,076
Okay.

722
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:43,418
Why isn't Heo Min-jeong
answering her phone?

723
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:47,338
No matter how busy she is,
she should come to the get-together.

724
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:49,298
- Take me with you!
- Jeez.

725
00:41:49,382 --> 00:41:51,718
Heo Min-jeong!

726
00:41:54,554 --> 00:41:57,557
No. Take your shoes off,
and I'll massage them.

727
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,058
- I'm gonna…
- What?

728
00:41:59,142 --> 00:42:00,476
…head home now.

729
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,228
- Okay.
- Bye.

730
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:05,023
- Bye. See you tomorrow!
- Bye.

731
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:07,650
- Bye.
- See you tomorrow.

732
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:09,444
- Good job today!
- Thanks!

733
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,237
Taxi!

734
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:15,533
Are you available?

735
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:17,702
Do you need a cab?

736
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:19,620
It's Yoon Seok-hoon.

737
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:20,955
Mr. Yoon!

738
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:22,707
What took you so long?

739
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:26,919
Do you know how long
we've been waiting for you?

740
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:30,006
Okay. Just hop in.

741
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:31,132
Let me take you home.

742
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:33,426
Mr. Hwang, have her sit up front.

743
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:34,594
Okay.

744
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:36,095
You're a total meanie.

745
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:38,014
Let me.

746
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:44,187
Are you okay?

747
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:48,232
Gosh.

748
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:52,528
At this rate,
her head isn't going to survive.

749
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:54,697
I'm fine. I'm…

750
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:07,960
Have some water.

751
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:11,047
Thank… you.

752
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:15,426
Take small sips, or you'll throw up.

753
00:43:16,177 --> 00:43:17,095
Okay.

754
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:24,560
Are you okay?

755
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:26,145
I'm fine.

756
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:29,982
Here.

757
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:32,819
Thank… you.

758
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:39,033
It's the third handkerchief.

759
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:45,748
Mr. Yoon,

760
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:47,959
what cologne do you use?

761
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:51,003
It smells good.

762
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:58,636
Please pull over if you see a pharmacy.

763
00:43:59,512 --> 00:44:00,930
Okay.

764
00:44:20,283 --> 00:44:22,785
ANMYEONG PHARMACY

765
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:25,997
Take one of them

766
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:28,166
with this drink.

767
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:30,126
Okay.

768
00:44:31,586 --> 00:44:32,628
This is inappropriate.

769
00:44:32,712 --> 00:44:33,921
It's inappropriate.

770
00:44:36,716 --> 00:44:38,551
This is inappropriate, Kang Hyo-min!

771
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:16,339
What is it?

772
00:45:16,923 --> 00:45:19,300
What is it? What's wrong?

773
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:22,845
Min-jeong. Why are you here?

774
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:27,016
I knew you'd pull this crap.

775
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:28,893
I knew you'd play dumb.

776
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,145
After what you put me through last night.

777
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:32,313
I did?

778
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:35,608
Go shower.
I gotta shower after I work out.

779
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:37,068
What did you do with my clothes?

780
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:39,862
I folded them.

781
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,496
What the heck did I do last night?

782
00:45:50,248 --> 00:45:51,832
My head is killing me, damn it.

783
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:32,123
What's with those eyes?

784
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:35,418
What?

785
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:43,342
Don't pull that macho act in front of me.

786
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,429
We're coworkers.

787
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:48,347
What are you talking about?

788
00:46:48,431 --> 00:46:49,890
I'm just naturally manly.

789
00:46:51,017 --> 00:46:52,476
I'm gonna wash up. Have some soup.

790
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,020
Can't you set the table?

791
00:46:55,855 --> 00:46:57,189
Got it.

792
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:03,612
It's good.

793
00:47:07,575 --> 00:47:09,368
Aren't you having any?

794
00:47:09,452 --> 00:47:10,536
I don't eat breakfast.

795
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:12,038
I see.

796
00:47:12,121 --> 00:47:14,749
And you just happened to have
some hangover soup?

797
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:16,959
Are you kidding me?

798
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:19,295
I made it last night.

799
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:20,338
To feed you.

800
00:47:22,298 --> 00:47:23,758
I feel like I'm your husband.

801
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:25,426
You little…

802
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:27,803
By the way,

803
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:30,139
what happened last night?

804
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:31,307
Of course.

805
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:33,351
Of course you don't remember.

806
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:35,269
HEO MIN-JEONG

807
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:36,812
She picked up.

808
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:39,982
Where are you, Min-jeong?

809
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:41,692
Come now!

810
00:47:41,776 --> 00:47:44,862
You made such a fuss
about getting me to come,

811
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:46,489
and you were completely wasted.

812
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:49,450
Why did you change your door code?

813
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,496
You should have told me.

814
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:55,414
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

815
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:58,042
You've always dropped me off at home,

816
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,585
so this is my first time here.

817
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:01,337
Right.

818
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:04,173
Who's the person in the photo
next to your bed?

819
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:06,258
Who?

820
00:48:06,342 --> 00:48:08,219
You know…

821
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:10,721
I saw a full-figured woman.

822
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:12,223
Oh, that's me.

823
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:15,017
- What?
- That's me.

824
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:17,478
When was that?

825
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:20,940
It was about seven years ago,
so I was in my mid-thirties.

826
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:29,323
You look a lot younger now.

827
00:48:29,407 --> 00:48:30,324
- Right?
- Yes.

828
00:48:30,408 --> 00:48:32,118
It's important to take care of yourself.

829
00:48:32,201 --> 00:48:33,994
- So it seems.
- Yes.

830
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:40,626
Who was that lady the other day?
The one who came to the office.

831
00:48:41,252 --> 00:48:42,294
Who?

832
00:48:42,378 --> 00:48:44,630
She came with the divorce case,
but you turned her down.

833
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:46,674
Mr. Kim Yul-seong kept going on

834
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,509
about how you turned down a client.

835
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,344
Do you know her?

836
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:51,512
She's my husband's mistress.

837
00:48:52,221 --> 00:48:53,472
Hey!

838
00:48:53,556 --> 00:48:54,932
Come on!

839
00:48:55,683 --> 00:48:57,435
You're being such a handful.

840
00:48:57,518 --> 00:48:58,436
Hey.

841
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:00,312
Thanks.

842
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:05,234
Ex-husband, to be exact.

843
00:49:05,985 --> 00:49:09,530
That mistress came to me
to divorce my ex-husband.

844
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:13,242
I'm in utter shock.

845
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:14,702
My heart is beating so fast.

846
00:49:15,536 --> 00:49:17,121
What shocked you?

847
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:18,622
That I'm a divorcée?

848
00:49:18,706 --> 00:49:20,541
Or that my ex-husband cheated on me?

849
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:23,043
Or that the mistress had the nerve
to come to me?

850
00:49:23,127 --> 00:49:24,587
All of it!

851
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,797
But if I had to choose the most shocking,

852
00:49:27,423 --> 00:49:28,591
it's that you were married.

853
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,259
I have a kid too.

854
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:31,927
- A kid?
- She's 20.

855
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:36,765
Do you have feelings for me or something?

856
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:42,229
Where did that come from?

857
00:49:42,313 --> 00:49:43,314
Stop lying.

858
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:45,524
What are you so surprised about?

859
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,735
Are you for real?

860
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:48,819
Yes.

861
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:53,824
We practically spent
three years glued at the hip.

862
00:49:53,908 --> 00:49:56,118
We've shared enough meals
to build a road to Busan.

863
00:49:56,202 --> 00:49:57,369
And all that time…

864
00:49:57,453 --> 00:49:59,121
I never talked about my past.

865
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:01,373
Did you not?

866
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:04,752
Why did I think I knew you to your core?

867
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:07,379
You do. You just don't know my past.

868
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:09,006
Your past…

869
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:13,260
If we're talking about who I am today,
you know me better than anyone.

870
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:15,346
So, do you feel any better now?

871
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:16,514
No.

872
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:18,849
Let's get going if you're done.

873
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:19,892
Hang on.

874
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:21,810
Lay it all out. I want the full story.

875
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:24,355
Starting from what age?

876
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:25,773
The earliest you can remember.

877
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:30,569
My brain's in full gear.

878
00:50:30,653 --> 00:50:32,321
Seriously! I'm not joking.

879
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:39,995
So you're saying

880
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:43,040
you're pleading diminished capacity
because she was in love?

881
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:48,546
So if we assume
that half the population is in love,

882
00:50:48,629 --> 00:50:53,050
are you saying all the contracts
signed by that half aren't legally valid?

883
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:56,011
Gosh.

884
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:04,311
Mr. Jung Han-seok of Marble Soft is here.

885
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:07,064
- Let him in.
- Okay.

886
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:16,949
What brings you here?

887
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:19,451
My work wrapped up early, so I dropped by.

888
00:51:19,535 --> 00:51:21,287
I see. Take a seat.

889
00:51:31,714 --> 00:51:33,090
Don't let me interrupt you.

890
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:37,803
Anyway, we reject
the claims made in the complaint.

891
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:41,223
Isn't this just a threat
disguised as legal action,

892
00:51:41,307 --> 00:51:43,309
using my client's reputation as leverage?

893
00:51:43,392 --> 00:51:44,852
Watch your words.

894
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:45,936
A threat?

895
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:49,648
One party suffered irreparable harm
for the sole purpose

896
00:51:49,732 --> 00:51:52,735
of the other's sexual gratification.

897
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:57,114
What exactly is your client demanding?

898
00:51:57,865 --> 00:51:59,908
If you look at the pictures here,
the scars--

899
00:51:59,992 --> 00:52:01,910
I hate drawn-out discussions.

900
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:03,829
What does she want?

901
00:52:04,455 --> 00:52:06,749
Legal punishment and damage compensation.

902
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:11,378
Did you make

903
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:13,964
this document, Ms. Kang?

904
00:52:17,593 --> 00:52:18,719
Yes.

905
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:20,095
As the victim testified--

906
00:52:20,179 --> 00:52:21,096
The victim?

907
00:52:21,722 --> 00:52:22,723
Who's the victim?

908
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:25,601
A lawyer shouldn't use words so loosely.

909
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:28,562
She's a complainant.
Anyone can file a complaint.

910
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:31,023
As the complainant testified--

911
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:33,734
So are you saying
that I deliberately approached

912
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:35,778
Seol Eun-yeong like she was prey,

913
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:38,197
used my superior looks
and social status to wage

914
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,407
some kind of psychological warfare,
gaslighted her

915
00:52:40,491 --> 00:52:44,036
into a mentally compromised state,
and that any consent she gave

916
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:45,496
is not valid?

917
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:48,123
And so, I should be punished
for assault and pay for damages?

918
00:52:48,207 --> 00:52:49,792
- Yes.
- That's pure fiction.

919
00:52:50,376 --> 00:52:51,418
Lousy fiction.

920
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:59,927
I want to speak privately with Ms. Kang.
Can you leave us for a moment?

921
00:53:01,095 --> 00:53:02,930
Why? What is it?

922
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:05,808
What's this about?

923
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:09,770
I'll tell Ms. Kang

924
00:53:10,354 --> 00:53:12,231
what this is about.

925
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:20,280
Look at your faces.

926
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:21,949
I won't hurt her.

927
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:05,117
What did he say?

928
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:07,828
Right.

929
00:54:32,186 --> 00:54:33,103
You look so pretty.

930
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:40,819
I told you you look prettier
with your hair down.

931
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:51,205
How do you know Mr. Jung?

932
00:54:52,623 --> 00:54:55,292
I met him at a bar a few days ago.

933
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:59,004
I thought it might be useful
to get a feel for who he is,

934
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:01,381
so I talked to him briefly.

935
00:55:02,466 --> 00:55:04,635
Are you saying
you approached him intentionally?

936
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:06,178
To dig up something useful?

937
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:10,015
- It wasn't intentional.
- Haven't you heard of legal ethics?

938
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:11,683
Article 45 of the Code of Ethics

939
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:15,479
prohibits direct communication
with a represented party.

940
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:18,148
What are you doing
acting like some cheap attorney?

941
00:55:18,232 --> 00:55:19,107
Cheap?

942
00:55:19,191 --> 00:55:21,235
Yes. Cheap.

943
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:24,446
Forming a close relationship
with the opposing party

944
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:26,990
violates the duty
to uphold professional dignity.

945
00:55:27,074 --> 00:55:29,493
Wouldn't you call
an attorney without integrity "cheap"?

946
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:32,120
I don't have
a close relationship with him.

947
00:55:32,204 --> 00:55:33,330
What did I see, then?

948
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:34,623
It's not like that!

949
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:37,584
And do you follow every rule
in the code of ethics?

950
00:55:37,668 --> 00:55:38,544
Kang Hyo-min!

951
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:43,006
Didn't I tell you to tread carefully?

952
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:00,816
THE ART OF MAGIC

953
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:08,782
CONTACTS

954
00:56:08,866 --> 00:56:10,117
KANG HYO-MIN

955
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:13,412
<i>The person you have called</i>
<i>cannot be reached at the moment.</i>

956
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:16,039
Seriously…

957
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:31,346
Hello, Kang Hyo-min speaking.

958
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:32,431
<i>It's me.</i>

959
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:34,266
<i>I'm calling from my office</i>

960
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:36,226
<i>since it seems you blocked my number.</i>

961
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:37,811
What do you need?

962
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:39,855
Do you know Jung Han-seok personally?

963
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:41,607
<i>Why is that any of your concern?</i>

964
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:43,275
How do you two know each other?

965
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,652
Why the hell is he treating you like that?

966
00:56:45,736 --> 00:56:47,070
Why did he touch you like that?

967
00:56:48,572 --> 00:56:49,656
Mr. Han,

968
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:53,160
is this really a conversation
we should be having?

969
00:56:56,455 --> 00:56:57,664
Where are you?

970
00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:00,417
Let's meet.

971
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,711
We have no business seeing each other.

972
00:57:05,047 --> 00:57:05,964
Hyo-min.

973
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:24,483
Damn it.

974
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:25,168
KANG HYO-MIN

975
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:28,672
Hello, Ms. Kang.

976
00:58:29,297 --> 00:58:30,424
Go on.

977
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:35,262
I still have some work left,
so I'm heading back to the office.

978
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:37,639
Yes.

979
00:58:38,557 --> 00:58:39,641
Sure.

980
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:57,909
<i>Why didn't you tell me?</i>

981
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:01,079
I didn't realize you were
the opposing counsel,

982
00:59:01,163 --> 00:59:02,998
so I said more than I should have.

983
00:59:03,874 --> 00:59:04,958
I enjoyed it.

984
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:08,712
It was a kind of sexual satisfaction

985
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:12,257
rooted in emotional intimacy
and mental stimulation.

986
00:59:13,842 --> 00:59:14,885
I'm sorry.

987
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:17,679
I should have told you
that I represent Ms. Seol.

988
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:20,932
I didn't mean to keep it a secret.
I just--

989
00:59:21,016 --> 00:59:22,017
Just what?

990
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:25,562
Were you fishing for something
you could use to your advantage?

991
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:29,191
I'll let it go.

992
00:59:30,442 --> 00:59:31,610
I like you.

993
00:59:31,693 --> 00:59:33,403
Please don't complicate things.

994
00:59:33,487 --> 00:59:34,696
What can I do?

995
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:36,907
If I want to simplify something
that's complicated,

996
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:38,283
what do I do?

997
00:59:41,078 --> 00:59:42,954
We should probably wrap
this up first, right?

998
00:59:43,038 --> 00:59:46,708
That way, there won't be
a conflict of interest between us.

999
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:49,211
Is compensation what Eun-yeong wants?

1000
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:51,296
Yes.

1001
00:59:59,638 --> 01:00:01,264
Write down the amount.

1002
01:00:01,348 --> 01:00:02,933
I'll accept whatever you write.

1003
01:00:07,896 --> 01:00:10,315
I didn't know she was in that state.

1004
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:11,858
I'm worried.

1005
01:00:14,653 --> 01:00:17,364
You should express
your feelings toward her yourself.

1006
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:18,490
No.

1007
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:21,743
I'm not worried about her.

1008
01:00:22,661 --> 01:00:24,287
I'm worried about

1009
01:00:24,371 --> 01:00:26,081
what you might think of me.

1010
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:28,291
I'm not a perv or a sadist.

1011
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:30,127
It was just the kind of erotic expression

1012
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:32,546
you'd expect between ordinary couples.

1013
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:36,466
But her skin was just

1014
01:00:37,134 --> 01:00:38,844
a little unusual.

1015
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:42,556
I want to go out with you.

1016
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:44,141
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

1017
01:00:44,224 --> 01:00:46,852
- I'm not asking for anything right now.
- Mr. Jung.

1018
01:00:50,522 --> 01:00:52,149
Let her name her price on the check

1019
01:00:52,232 --> 01:00:53,984
and sign the NDA.

1020
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:57,154
I tolerated this for your sake,
but this is as far as that goes.

1021
01:00:57,237 --> 01:00:59,948
If you push this any further,

1022
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:02,659
people will watch the video
and decide for themselves

1023
01:01:03,451 --> 01:01:05,412
whether it was actual consent or not.

1024
01:01:08,248 --> 01:01:09,207
The video?

1025
01:01:09,291 --> 01:01:11,251
I guess Eun-yeong didn't tell you that.

1026
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:13,128
I have a video.

1027
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:16,965
Of course,
she agreed to record it as well.

1028
01:01:22,721 --> 01:01:23,722
I'll call you.

1029
01:01:38,028 --> 01:01:38,945
<i>A video?</i>

1030
01:01:39,029 --> 01:01:40,238
Yes.

1031
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:44,117
I don't know where to draw
the line with the client.

1032
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:47,204
That was reckless of me.

1033
01:01:47,287 --> 01:01:48,455
I'm sorry.

1034
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:54,544
Why do you think
the client filed this lawsuit?

1035
01:01:56,838 --> 01:01:58,757
Compensation

1036
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:01,551
for her wounds?

1037
01:02:01,635 --> 01:02:03,386
I'd say it's emotional, not physical.

1038
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:07,307
Do you know

1039
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:10,268
why I let you join my team?

1040
01:02:11,019 --> 01:02:12,896
Because I was the top of my class?

1041
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:14,022
Because I seemed smart?

1042
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:16,024
No.

1043
01:02:17,817 --> 01:02:20,403
Because you understand
the essence of the lawsuit.

1044
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:24,491
Love comes in many different shades.

1045
01:02:25,075 --> 01:02:28,036
Heterosexual, homosexual,
maternal, paternal, reverential,

1046
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:31,164
brotherhood, friendship, camaraderie,
love for humanity, and self-love.

1047
01:02:31,248 --> 01:02:32,916
And that love hurts people.

1048
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:37,128
Once that wound festers,
they consider legal action.

1049
01:02:37,212 --> 01:02:39,589
At that breaking point,
they believe their last resort,

1050
01:02:39,673 --> 01:02:43,009
the lawsuit, will protect
their happiness and their right to it.

1051
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:46,054
I want to represent people like that.

1052
01:02:48,223 --> 01:02:49,266
Because it'd be fun?

1053
01:02:50,809 --> 01:02:52,102
You're right.

1054
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:55,814
People turn to lawsuits
when the pain becomes too much.

1055
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:58,775
And at that breaking point,

1056
01:03:00,485 --> 01:03:03,363
they believe their last resort,
the lawsuit,

1057
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:05,991
will protect their happiness
and their right to it.

1058
01:03:07,284 --> 01:03:08,785
I'm sure Ms. Seol felt the same.

1059
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:12,122
When you meet a client wanting
to heal their scars through a lawsuit,

1060
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:14,833
you need to look beneath the scars.

1061
01:03:17,419 --> 01:03:22,340
Winning the case or receiving compensation
isn't always the only form of comfort.

1062
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:24,426
Yes, sir.

1063
01:03:24,509 --> 01:03:27,262
The NDA they're offering
is probably one-sided.

1064
01:03:28,013 --> 01:03:28,972
I guess so.

1065
01:03:30,557 --> 01:03:32,392
I bet the breakup was like that too.

1066
01:03:34,686 --> 01:03:37,856
Revise the NDA
so that it applies both ways

1067
01:03:37,939 --> 01:03:39,399
and present it to the client.

1068
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:41,151
Both ways?

1069
01:03:44,154 --> 01:03:45,196
I'm on it.

1070
01:03:46,406 --> 01:03:48,825
Is that what he really said?

1071
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:51,911
Did you consent to being recorded?

1072
01:03:51,995 --> 01:03:53,288
That's…

1073
01:03:54,706 --> 01:03:55,832
Back then…

1074
01:03:59,127 --> 01:04:00,337
Let's try it this way.

1075
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:02,630
The NDA they want

1076
01:04:02,714 --> 01:04:04,382
only applies one way.

1077
01:04:04,466 --> 01:04:07,052
Let's revise it to make it mutual
and propose that instead.

1078
01:04:07,135 --> 01:04:09,179
That way he can't leak the video--

1079
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:12,098
He's not someone who would leak it.

1080
01:04:12,182 --> 01:04:14,809
Still, you need the legal protection.

1081
01:04:16,436 --> 01:04:18,146
I guess I do, right?

1082
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:20,940
And about the compensation…

1083
01:04:21,024 --> 01:04:23,401
I'll just take the actual expenses.

1084
01:04:23,943 --> 01:04:25,403
My medical and legal fees.

1085
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:28,323
Why on earth…

1086
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:30,700
I didn't do this to get money.

1087
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:34,996
But then again, I don't know

1088
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:36,956
why I did it.

1089
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:40,210
He just ended it on his own terms.

1090
01:04:40,919 --> 01:04:43,671
The breakup alone
was hard enough to accept.

1091
01:04:43,755 --> 01:04:48,426
But the fact that I'm the only one
left with such deep scars

1092
01:04:49,427 --> 01:04:50,720
feels unfair.

1093
01:04:51,471 --> 01:04:54,015
I even lost my job because of it,

1094
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:56,810
while he's out there thriving.

1095
01:04:57,811 --> 01:05:01,314
I just felt like I had to do something.

1096
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:05,944
Throughout the relationship,
I was always the one being dragged along.

1097
01:05:06,027 --> 01:05:09,364
I think part of me just wanted
to break free from that helplessness.

1098
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:14,869
I don't need money anymore.

1099
01:05:16,413 --> 01:05:19,666
What hurt me the most was blaming myself.

1100
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:24,212
But when you said even love can be
a kind of diminished capacity,

1101
01:05:24,295 --> 01:05:26,673
it made me realize I wasn't being weak

1102
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:30,385
and that anyone can end up like that
when they're in love.

1103
01:05:31,511 --> 01:05:33,430
Hearing your words…

1104
01:05:36,558 --> 01:05:38,184
really comforted me.

1105
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:43,690
I hope your heart
doesn't scar like a keloid.

1106
01:05:44,399 --> 01:05:48,361
The end of love always leaves a scar,

1107
01:05:50,029 --> 01:05:53,450
but I hope it doesn't linger as pain.

1108
01:05:55,243 --> 01:05:56,202
I hope so too.

1109
01:05:57,537 --> 01:06:00,248
Just like we revised
the NDA to go both ways,

1110
01:06:00,999 --> 01:06:02,876
the breakup should be mutual too.

1111
01:06:05,003 --> 01:06:06,045
Yes.

1112
01:06:06,129 --> 01:06:08,131
End it with dignity.

1113
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:12,760
Let that final moment
be the one that stays with you.

1114
01:06:17,307 --> 01:06:19,893
Okay. I will.

1115
01:06:25,857 --> 01:06:27,192
You can sign here.

1116
01:06:28,276 --> 01:06:30,111
PARTY A: JUNG HAN-SEOK

1117
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:33,531
Here.

1118
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:37,785
PARTY B: SEOL EUN-YEONG

1119
01:06:50,715 --> 01:06:51,883
Jung Han-seok.

1120
01:06:56,054 --> 01:06:57,138
Let's talk.

1121
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:11,027
Did you have to take it this far?

1122
01:07:11,778 --> 01:07:13,488
It's so tiring.

1123
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:20,370
You said that often.

1124
01:07:20,453 --> 01:07:23,039
If making me the monster helps you cope,

1125
01:07:23,122 --> 01:07:25,083
go ahead.

1126
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:26,834
But save it

1127
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:29,921
for the privacy of your own home.

1128
01:07:30,547 --> 01:07:31,923
I won't make you a monster.

1129
01:07:32,674 --> 01:07:33,841
Also,

1130
01:07:34,634 --> 01:07:38,012
I won't distort the good times we had.

1131
01:07:39,597 --> 01:07:42,475
Just because your feelings have changed,

1132
01:07:43,142 --> 01:07:45,520
it doesn't mean
I doubt your feelings back then.

1133
01:07:46,187 --> 01:07:47,772
It's not that I trust you.

1134
01:07:49,107 --> 01:07:50,483
I trust myself.

1135
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:56,906
I'm the kind of woman a man like you

1136
01:07:58,992 --> 01:08:00,451
could truly fall for.

1137
01:08:16,843 --> 01:08:18,720
Going to the office?
I can give you a ride.

1138
01:08:18,803 --> 01:08:20,888
No, thanks. Just go on your way.

1139
01:08:21,848 --> 01:08:23,766
Now that things are wrapped up,

1140
01:08:23,850 --> 01:08:24,934
can't we see each other?

1141
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:27,895
You're not my type.

1142
01:08:28,438 --> 01:08:29,981
Playing hard to get can be fun too.

1143
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:33,192
You're having a hard time facing reality.

1144
01:08:34,444 --> 01:08:37,030
If only loving someone
required a certification.

1145
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:40,116
Then people like you
wouldn't be able to misuse

1146
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:42,160
something so noble for mere gratification.

1147
01:08:43,536 --> 01:08:45,913
It's such a shame that
a perfect, well-rounded woman like you

1148
01:08:45,997 --> 01:08:48,082
doesn't know

1149
01:08:48,875 --> 01:08:49,834
how to enjoy life.

1150
01:08:50,627 --> 01:08:52,712
You're the one missing something.

1151
01:08:53,338 --> 01:08:56,591
Restraint and a pure heart
broaden the spectrum of emotion.

1152
01:08:56,674 --> 01:09:00,637
At the far end of that spectrum
lies the one thing you don't know.

1153
01:09:01,888 --> 01:09:04,182
The emotion you will never know.

1154
01:09:05,767 --> 01:09:07,060
That's the real shame.

1155
01:09:14,108 --> 01:09:15,193
That's disappointing.

1156
01:09:44,389 --> 01:09:45,973
ROSEMARY

1157
01:10:20,508 --> 01:10:23,970
APPLICATION FOR CONFIRMATION
OF AGREEMENT TO DIVORCE

1158
01:10:24,637 --> 01:10:25,638
Okay.

1159
01:10:28,015 --> 01:10:29,517
Let's get divorced.

1160
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:35,982
But…

1161
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:40,194
let me keep Hash once a week.

1162
01:10:42,321 --> 01:10:43,239
Okay.

1163
01:10:43,865 --> 01:10:46,200
Can you keep making me
the cologne and soap?

1164
01:10:47,368 --> 01:10:48,286
I will.

1165
01:10:50,455 --> 01:10:52,123
I'll make sure you don't run out.

1166
01:12:48,489 --> 01:12:51,659
BEYOND THE BAR

1167
01:12:51,784 --> 01:12:53,828
<i>This new policy will be</i>
<i>implemented going forward.</i>

1168
01:12:53,911 --> 01:12:55,580
I mean, you only just took office.

1169
01:12:55,663 --> 01:12:59,166
How can you change the incentive system
without our consensus?

1170
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:01,085
<i>How long must we watch you</i>
<i>bleed associates dry?</i>

1171
01:13:01,168 --> 01:13:03,421
Then how much longer
are we expected to let this go on?

1172
01:13:03,504 --> 01:13:05,464
Should we start digging up dirt on Yoon?

1173
01:13:06,299 --> 01:13:07,967
I already have someone on him. Be patient.

1174
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:10,970
The defendant has been criminally reported
by his wife's younger brother

1175
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:12,930
and charged
with aiding and abetting suicide.

1176
01:13:13,014 --> 01:13:15,725
<i>I don't need a lawyer.</i>
<i>I'll just accept my punishment.</i>

1177
01:13:15,808 --> 01:13:17,643
It's all thanks to you.

1178
01:13:17,727 --> 01:13:19,395
- Are you almost done?
- Oh my gosh!

1179
01:13:19,896 --> 01:13:23,024
And we respectfully request
that the defendant be acquitted.

1180
01:13:23,107 --> 01:13:24,650
<i>Can we meet up?</i>

1181
01:13:28,988 --> 01:13:30,990
