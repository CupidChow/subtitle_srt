IVF & IUI
HOSEON FERTILITY CLINIC

00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:49,550
FERTILITY COUNSELING ROOM

5
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:51,510
In 1985, Hoseon Fertility Clinic

6
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:55,472
achieved the world's first IVF birth

7
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:57,766
using immature oocytes.

8
00:00:57,849 --> 00:01:00,269
Our fertility preservation clinic,

9
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:03,981
offering egg, sperm,
and embryo freezing, is world-class.

10
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,358
We hold the largest sperm stock in Korea.

11
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:08,944
You bunch of scammers!

12
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,326
You bunch of scammers!

13
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:19,746
-What's his deal?
-He sounds crazy.

14
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:20,872
Give it back.

15
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:22,249
Give it back!

16
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:25,419
Calm down.
Let's sit down and talk about this.

17
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:26,753
You said you're the best.

18
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:29,339
You said your stuff was world-class!

19
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:32,217
I get how upset you are,
but you can't do this.

20
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:33,468
Mr. Park Gi-beom.

21
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:36,096
Calm down. Let's just sit down and talk.

22
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,139
Back off.

23
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:51,153
Get off me!

24
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,701
Let go. Give it back!

25
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,412
I said give it back!

26
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,956
I want my sperm back!

27
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:16,303
HOT WATER IS THE TEST FOR TEA AND LOVE

28
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,311
Including the damaged medical equipment,

29
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,521
Hoseon Fertility Clinic
is claiming damages

30
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:28,190
of 423 million won.

31
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:31,068
Isn't that a little high?

32
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:35,489
They say this equipment
is worth over 600 million won.

33
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:40,160
Can the client afford to pay it?

34
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,119
No.

35
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:45,165
But the executives are asking us
to pay special attention to this case.

36
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,417
Why?

37
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,586
Is the client someone with internal ties?

38
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:50,921
No.

39
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,923
Hoseon is on the other side.

40
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,384
Hoseon used to be
our corporate law team's client,

41
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:56,426
but I think

42
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,346
the team resigned from a case
to uphold legal ethics.

43
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,432
After that, Hoseon started playing dirty,

44
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,976
and we lost
all our hospital-related clients.

45
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:07,354
Mr. Ko is pretty fired up.

46
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:11,358
Tell me. Why did the client
cause such a scene?

47
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,236
I'm still looking into it.

48
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,445
I should meet him.

49
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,864
He's coming to the office next Wednesday.

50
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:21,660
Have two of the newcomers go over it.

51
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:24,538
Sure. I'll put Kang Hyo-min
and Ji Guk-hyeon on it.

52
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,709
One more thing.

53
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,670
The lawsuit over
the flawed management resolutionâ€¦

54
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:32,879
Yes?

55
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:35,632
I assigned it to Na Dong-su,

56
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,718
but he's stalling,
and it's not the first time.

57
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:40,429
Na Dong-suâ€¦ Is he Hong Do-yun's associate?

58
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:41,388
Yes.

59
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,431
He's in his second year,

60
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:44,391
but he logs
under five billable hours a month.

61
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:45,976
BILLABLE HOURS: TIME BILLED TO A CLIENT

62
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,979
He sometimes works with our team,
but a two-hour task takes a week,

63
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,188
and his results are a mess.

64
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:52,274
Total salary thief.

65
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,943
He's the son of
Attorney Hong Do-yun's client.

66
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:01,783
Us associates log
over 200 billable hours a month,

67
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:05,454
and that salary thief is killing morale.

68
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:07,622
Please do something about it.

69
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:08,665
I will.

70
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,625
Thank you.

71
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:14,212
I'll get going, then.

72
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:15,255
Okay.

73
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,299
-Bye.
-Bye.

74
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,103
Mr. Yoon!

75
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:36,318
Where's he rushing off to?

76
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:40,447
-Sir.
-Yes?

77
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,532
Where's Mr. Yoon rushing off to?

78
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:44,785
He gets off work early on Fridays.

79
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,661
-Why?
-To pick his kid up.

80
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,997
Mr. Ji, did you finish the UCPA complaint?

81
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:49,956
A kid?

82
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:59,174
Hash!

83
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:00,884
Dad's here, Hash!

84
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,178
Come here.

85
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,474
Let's go. Come on, Hash.

86
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:08,850
Let's go!

87
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,286
Okay, Hash.

88
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,783
Is it because it's a day off?

89
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,201
The weather's so nice and warm.

90
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:18,587
Open it.

91
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,226
Look.

92
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:04,799
I spent two years

93
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:07,135
trying to win your heart.

94
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,971
Thankfully, you opened up to me.

95
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:12,140
Now here we are, together.

96
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:16,519
This past year with you
has been truly wonderful.

97
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:20,106
Ever since I told you how I felt,

98
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:22,359
I've said "I love you"

99
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:24,945
more times than I can count.

100
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:28,031
But I felt hesitant

101
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,659
thinking about saying those words today.

102
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,786
I wondered if the words "I love you"

103
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:35,664
can truly express
everything I feel for you

104
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:37,207
and if there was anything better.

105
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,209
But in the end,

106
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:43,672
nothing conveys my heart
better than those words.

107
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,173
I love you.

108
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,385
These three simple words

109
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,429
are everything I want to say to you.

110
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,268
Kang Hyo-min, my darling,

111
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:00,855
will you marry me?

112
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:07,487
What's this all of a sudden?

113
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,947
It's about time.

114
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,783
We're at that age, and it's been a year.

115
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,159
Isn't this what comes next?

116
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,080
I have something to say.

117
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,167
You're making me nervous.

118
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,420
What is it?

119
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:30,844
Hash.

120
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:37,100
Hash. Sorry, I wish I could do more.

121
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,106
Let's go.

122
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,299
Who are you?

123
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:35,718
Intruder, first floor! I need backup!

124
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:44,978
-Let go of me.
-Hey!

125
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,020
I know everything!

126
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,274
The corruption
involving your medical complex!

127
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:52,986
I'll uncover everything
and take down everyone involved!

128
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,195
You hear me?

129
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,405
Stay still.

130
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,700
Everything's screwed up!

131
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:02,120
It's all ruined!

132
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,122
You people did this!

133
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:18,761
Where could he be?

134
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:21,181
Call him.

135
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:22,307
Okay.

136
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:26,519
Hello?

137
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,438
Mr. Park Gi-beom?

138
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,941
Sorry? The police?

139
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,706
Mr. Park, your attorney is here.

140
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:53,504
Leave.

141
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:56,216
I'm sick of attorneys.

142
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,762
After that terrible incident,

143
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,765
I went to see several attorneys.

144
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,975
They say there's no way to win.

145
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:09,187
No solutions,
just a fat consultation bill.

146
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,856
The law? Attorneys?

147
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,485
I don't need any of that.
I'll take care of it myself.

148
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,946
I'll uncover everything,
all the corruption,

149
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:19,572
and bring them down.

150
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,075
I don't need you. Go.

151
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:26,537
Sir, you've committed
a very serious crime.

152
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:29,457
Property damage, obstruction of business,
aggravated damage,

153
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:33,544
nighttime trespassing,
and assault on the guards.

154
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:35,546
You'll be arrested soon.

155
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:40,426
How is it that you attorneys
say exactly the same thing?

156
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:44,555
We can't help it.

157
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:51,521
Studying law causes
an earthquake in your mind.

158
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,231
It shifts your mindset.

159
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,777
After that, we see everything

160
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,862
from a legal perspective.

161
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:01,990
The more you understand the law,

162
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:05,493
the more confined your thinking becomes,

163
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,495
like a small mind trapped by dogma.

164
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,497
You talk as if you're different.

165
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,541
That's right.

166
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:12,667
Why is that?

167
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:16,546
Every lawyer you've talked to was right.

168
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,798
You can't win this case.

169
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,387
You didn't even listen.
How would you know?

170
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:27,015
The lawyers would've
taken the case otherwise.

171
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:30,935
Then you wouldn't have snuck
into the clinic at night

172
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:34,105
in the name of justice
and ended up fighting the guards.

173
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:36,065
You must have a better idea, then.

174
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:39,861
I'll have to hear your story first.

175
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,279
One thing is for sure,

176
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:45,074
I don't just fight in the ring.

177
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,659
If I'm at a disadvantage in the ring,

178
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:49,495
I take it outside and finish it there.

179
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:55,084
I won't be a legal technician
trapped by dogma.

180
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,253
I'll stand by your side and help you.

181
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:14,187
Where should I start?

182
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:19,067
Tell me why you're doing this first.

183
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:26,991
I entrusted my sperm
to Hoseon Fertility Clinic,

184
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:31,746
and those bastards destroyed
my precious sperm by mistake.

185
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:35,291
Sperm? As in male sperm?

186
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,459
Yes.

187
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,461
They lost something so precious

188
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,755
and acted like
it was none of their business.

189
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,549
I did it because I felt so wronged.

190
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:45,802
I see.

191
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:48,721
Doesn't the clinic bear
some responsibility?

192
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:52,058
They owe me compensation.

193
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:55,061
My sperm is worth far more
than that medical equipment.

194
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:57,355
If you put a price on it,

195
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,607
my sperm's worth like ten billion won.

196
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:02,610
Ten billion won?

197
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:06,030
Why is your estimate so high?

198
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:08,658
If it's been lost,
why not store a new sample?

199
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:12,537
You're 35.
I'd say you're still in your prime.

200
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:17,834
That's impossible.

201
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,211
Sorry?

202
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,546
I said that's impossible.

203
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:25,591
I'm infertile.

204
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,554
Infertile? Then how did you
store your sperm?

205
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,264
A year ago,

206
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,142
I had testicular cancer and had surgery.

207
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:35,893
It left me infertile.

208
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:37,186
Gosh.

209
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:42,108
The doctor warned me
that I might lose fertility after surgery,

210
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,485
so I'd stored my sperm before the surgery.

211
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,534
But when we tried to conceive through IVFâ€¦

212
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,750
The sperm had been ruined.

213
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:02,628
Yes.

214
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:05,840
That's why I did it.

215
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:10,511
And now the clinic says

216
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,306
they'll do another procedure for free.

217
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:22,940
I'm sorry.

218
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,530
Honestly, in my current situation,

219
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,575
I can't even afford four million,

220
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,660
let alone four hundred.

221
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:40,917
Let's check the facts first.

222
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,349
Please. I'm counting on you.

223
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,435
I'm really relying on you.

224
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,149
-Hello.
-Hello.

225
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,401
-This is Attorney Min So-ra.
-Hello.

226
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:10,613
This way, please.

227
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,785
I appreciate you stepping in,
even for something so trivial.

228
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,036
Thank you.

229
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,037
Not at all.

230
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,580
It's only right that I handle it.

231
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:21,040
We can't afford any noise

232
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,875
while the medical complex project
is underway.

233
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,087
Right. It's such a huge project
that everyone is very nervous.

234
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,589
They don't want
even the slightest amount of noise.

235
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:31,676
Let's settle and wrap it up
as quickly as possible.

236
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:32,760
Sure.

237
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:35,555
When securing funding,
noise control is key

238
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:36,764
during investment reviews.

239
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:37,932
Exactly.

240
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:41,852
Why was the meeting
scheduled at Yullim, though?

241
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:43,187
That'sâ€¦

242
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:45,439
This is all a power game.

243
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:46,816
Get it together.

244
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:48,359
Yes, sir.

245
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:55,866
Soâ€¦

246
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,427
-We're using the main conference room.
-Okay.

247
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,720
-Shall we?
-Sure.

248
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:42,830
As you know, with charges like
property damage, obstruction of business,

249
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,541
aggravated damage,
nighttime trespassing, and assault,

250
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:49,378
a civil and criminal case
could double the damages,

251
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:52,131
and this could result
in immediate detention.

252
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,675
But considering Mr. Park's situation,

253
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:56,552
the clinic is willing

254
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:58,846
to show leniency and settle

255
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:02,391
with a 400 million won claim
for property damage only.

256
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:05,770
A payment of 400 million won
by the end of this month

257
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:08,606
and signing a non-contact agreement

258
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:11,442
will prevent further legal action.

259
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:14,904
My client also suffered losses.

260
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:18,407
Since my client's damages
exceed the claim,

261
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:20,826
the clinic should offset the claims

262
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,620
and remit the remaining balance.

263
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:24,664
What losses?

264
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,248
Remaining balance?

265
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,627
My client's sperm has been ruined.

266
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:32,421
Didn't you read
the sperm storage agreement?

267
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:33,881
I did.

268
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:36,550
And you read the disclaimer
and the limitation of liability clause?

269
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:38,511
Yes, it was very meticulous.

270
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:39,804
There are no loopholes, either.

271
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:41,889
LOOPHOLE: A WAY TO BYPASS THE LAW
WITHOUT BREAKING IT

272
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:44,141
Don't you know
that clause doesn't hold up?

273
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:48,229
Of course you know.

274
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,855
Even a first-year knows that.

275
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:52,358
-Why is it invalid?
-Under Article 7, Subparagraph 1

276
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,485
of the Act on the Regulation
of Terms and Conditions,

277
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:58,489
any clause that waives
legal liability for intentional misconduct

278
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:00,825
or gross negligence

279
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,953
by the business
or its employees is invalid.

280
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,205
Whether it was gross negligence or not

281
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,833
depends on the facts.

282
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,460
-Let me hear the damage claim first.
-No, there's no need.

283
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:12,837
It's 500 million won.

284
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,679
Easy with the bluffing.

285
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:25,599
Are you suggesting
we take this all the way?

286
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:28,269
You called us over.
What are you trying to pull?

287
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:32,064
That's 100 million won
even after the offset.

288
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:34,108
We want the 100 million won in cash.

289
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:37,528
Let's go.

290
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,160
We'll see you in court.

291
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:46,245
Sure.

292
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:52,126
I heard you were sharp,
but all I see is bluffing.

293
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:10,311
Can heâ€¦

294
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,230
really get 500 million won?

295
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:16,358
No.

296
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:17,401
It's impossible.

297
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:20,279
It's difficult to appraise the sperm
at such a high value,

298
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,989
and even with emotional damages,

299
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:25,951
this will probably settle
somewhere in the tens of millions.

300
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:27,536
-I was bluffing.
-Sorry?

301
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,829
Then howâ€¦

302
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:30,372
We should end it with a deal.

303
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:34,710
What matters isn't the legal theory
but your leverage at the table.

304
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:37,379
We need something big to turn the tables.

305
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:42,176
We haven't found it yet,
so until then, we bluff.

306
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,512
You're awesome.

307
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:47,473
Your outstanding sense of diplomacyâ€¦

308
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:50,392
Bluffing under the threat
of criminal detention

309
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:52,645
isn't just risky. It's reckless.

310
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:58,025
What if they snap and say,
"Fine, let's take this all the way"?

311
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,443
What then?

312
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:03,906
Aren't you being reckless?

313
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,830
If they meant to go the distance,

314
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:13,415
they wouldn't even have come here.

315
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:17,211
Even for a bluff,
the claim amount is way too high.

316
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,089
Then what's your alternative?

317
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:26,846
A complaint without a solution
is just a pile of useless words.

318
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:29,223
This is a battle of facts.

319
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:32,142
A good litigation attorney
lives in the details.

320
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:34,270
We haven't even scratched the surface.

321
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:36,897
If we can't win in the ring--

322
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:38,566
We crush them outside the ring?

323
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:45,322
Go find something
that strengthens our leverage.

324
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:47,116
Yes, sir! I'll do my best!

325
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:49,702
Okay.

326
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:51,161
Hey.

327
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:56,750
Yes, sir.

328
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:06,385
These are attorneys
Ji Guk-hyeon and Kang Hyo-min.

329
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:07,428
I see.

330
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:11,140
I brought them here
to get the specifics of the case.

331
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:13,350
Okay.

332
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:15,227
I have a meeting to get to.

333
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:17,438
Mr. Yoon.

334
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:22,276
I don't mean to be sexistâ€¦

335
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,696
but given the subject matter,

336
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,365
I feel uncomfortable
around a female attorney.

337
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:31,952
Please don't get me wrong.

338
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:34,121
Some of the terms
are awkward to say out loud.

339
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:38,292
Plus, I get shy easily,
so I'm not good with my words.

340
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:41,587
I'll be outside.

341
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:45,633
I'll get the details from Mr. Ji later.

342
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:47,051
I'm sorry.

343
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,135
It's fine.

344
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:59,188
You can talk to me.

345
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:04,735
He just treated you as a woman,
not as his attorney.

346
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,321
How can you back down so easily?

347
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:12,284
Can you really defend others
when you can't even defend yourself?

348
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,916
Jeez.

349
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,543
What can I do? That was the client's wish.

350
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:22,962
What am I supposed to do?

351
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,131
What's wrong?

352
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:27,383
Hi.

353
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:28,926
He's prickly, right?

354
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:30,928
Yes.

355
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,681
He seems cold, but he's kind.

356
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:35,349
No way.

357
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:39,478
You were good from the start,
so you never saw his rough side.

358
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:40,562
Not at all.

359
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:41,814
When I was in law school,

360
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:44,149
I was Mr. Yoon's paralegal
for over three years.

361
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:45,275
You were?

362
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:47,444
He and I go way back.

363
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,071
Good luck.

364
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:54,576
Paralegalâ€¦

365
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,036
Yoon?

366
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,211
What did Mr. Park say?

367
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:07,214
I don't get what he's saying at all.

368
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:10,759
Didn't you talk to him for two hours?

369
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:13,345
Exactly. He kept going on
about useless stuff.

370
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:14,388
About what?

371
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:17,307
First, it was corruption
in the integrated medical complex,

372
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:20,519
then something about the clinic
being tied to someone powerful,

373
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:22,855
then how we have to expose everything
about the fraud.

374
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,815
Then the mention of a monsterâ€¦

375
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:27,026
"Monster"?

376
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:28,819
I have zero energy.

377
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:30,612
Tell me more.

378
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:32,197
Hey.

379
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:35,492
I'm sending you the recording.
Listen to it yourself.

380
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:37,870
Way to go, Ji Guk-hyeon!

381
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,789
I did my best for you, colleague.

382
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:42,041
Thank you, colleague.

383
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,422
Ye-rim heardâ€¦

384
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,091
everything at the clinic.

385
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:54,261
"What if it's a monster?"

386
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:55,971
Monster.

387
00:25:58,057 --> 00:25:59,850
"What if it's a monster?"

388
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:02,102
Monster.

389
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,563
"What if it's a monster?"

390
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,817
"What if it's a monster?"

391
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,070
Monster.

392
00:26:22,623 --> 00:26:23,624
Mr. Park?

393
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,085
This is Kang Hyo-min from Yullim.

394
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,962
Could I talk to you for a moment tomorrow?

395
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:47,648
Isn't the male attorney coming?

396
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:48,774
No.

397
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:52,152
It's just you and me today.

398
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:55,697
The thing is, Iâ€¦

399
00:26:55,781 --> 00:27:00,244
Sex, testicular cancer,
infertility, spermâ€¦

400
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:06,917
They're simply terms used
to specify and differentiate.

401
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:16,718
Do you know what my professor said
the moment she walked in

402
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:20,097
on the first day
of my law school class on sex crimes?

403
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:24,393
Penis, vaginaâ€¦

404
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,436
-Penetration.
-Oral sex.

405
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,855
Anal sex.

406
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:31,608
After repeating them
three times, she saidâ€¦

407
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:35,737
"Here, these words
are not to be spoken with emotion

408
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:37,322
or embarrassment."

409
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:42,578
"They're just nouns
used to describe a case."

410
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,459
I guess I should have
thought that through.

411
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:53,255
If it's okay, shall we talk?

412
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:55,966
Okay, let's do that.

413
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:39,176
Yes?

414
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:41,720
What is it?

415
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:43,430
I found the game changer.

416
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,100
The case of Mr. Park's destroyed sperm.

417
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:52,689
COURT

418
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:54,942
Defense counsel,
are you filing a countersuit?

419
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:56,818
HOSEON FERTILITY CLINIC
PROPERTY DAMAGE CASE

420
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,029
Yes, Your Honor.

421
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:01,782
The plaintiff had a duty

422
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:05,619
to store the defendant's sperm with
the care expected of a prudent manager.

423
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:08,121
However, the plaintiff
violated the duty of care

424
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:09,873
and destroyed the defendant's sperm.

425
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:12,751
And we're claiming
500 million won in damages.

426
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:14,711
-What? 500 million?
-What?

427
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:16,838
Did you say 500 million?

428
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:20,008
Yes, Your Honor.

429
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:21,927
We demand 500 million won.

430
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:27,432
Plaintiff's counsel, what do you say?

431
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:33,230
We admit the sperm was lost
due to negligence.

432
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:36,400
But even with the defendant's situation,

433
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:38,986
the damages should
not exceed 20 million won.

434
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:42,197
A countersuit of 500 million won
borders on absurdity.

435
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:44,533
This court is not a stage for theatrics.

436
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:45,701
What a load of crapâ€¦

437
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:49,121
Counsel, this is a courtroom.

438
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:52,416
Your Honor,

439
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,418
you heard the defendant's argument.

440
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:56,420
The claim itself is unfounded,

441
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:59,589
and the sum of 500 million won
is clearly unreasonable.

442
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:04,177
Clarify why the defendant is demanding

443
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:05,137
500 million won.

444
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:08,223
It's simple.

445
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:11,768
Under a deposit contract,
if an item worth 500 million won is lost

446
00:30:11,852 --> 00:30:16,315
due to the custodian's fault
during the deposit period,

447
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:19,067
they are liable to compensate

448
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:21,737
the full amount
under the terms of the deposit.

449
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,157
So you're saying the defendant's sperm

450
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,367
is worth 500 million won?

451
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:29,411
Yes, Your Honor.

452
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:30,787
Defense counsel,

453
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:34,166
submit proof to justify
the 500 million won amount.

454
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:35,250
I will, Your Honor.

455
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,255
I request a party examination
of the defendant, Mr. Park Gi-beom.

456
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:46,136
Why did you damage
the plaintiff's property?

457
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:53,685
When I heard my sperm was ruinedâ€¦

458
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,105
I don't know.

459
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:00,275
I was soâ€¦

460
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:05,113
Is the loss of sperm really
something to be that devastated about?

461
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:08,950
Sperm can be produced continuously.

462
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:10,619
No, it cannot.

463
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,832
I'm infertile.

464
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:23,090
Iâ€¦

465
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:26,843
A year ago,

466
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,721
I got testicular cancer.

467
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:34,226
They told me I needed surgery right away.

468
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,103
The doctor said

469
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:39,314
I'd make a full recovery
after the surgery,

470
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:41,817
but I might become infertile.

471
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:44,361
I see.

472
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,238
When I heard thatâ€¦

473
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:50,409
My mind went blank.

474
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:52,285
Becauseâ€¦

475
00:31:53,203 --> 00:31:54,246
my wife,

476
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:57,207
who was my fiancÃ©e at the time,

477
00:31:57,833 --> 00:32:01,670
wanted a child more than anything.

478
00:32:02,963 --> 00:32:05,590
Wanting a child
is understandable for any couple.

479
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:09,719
You sounded especially desperate.
Is there a reason?

480
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:18,562
There is.

481
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,273
To tell you the truthâ€¦

482
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:54,681
The woman who just entered the courtroomâ€¦

483
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:57,392
is my wife.

484
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:01,771
What happened to her face?

485
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:19,748
That's my wife.

486
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:25,212
She's the most beautiful
and precious person to me.

487
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:36,097
That's my wife.

488
00:33:41,645 --> 00:33:43,355
Has your wife made a decision?

489
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:45,023
Not yet.

490
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:48,235
I'm not sure
about putting Ye-rim out there.

491
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:53,573
It just feels like I'm turning her
into a spectacle to save myself.

492
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:57,869
Where is she now?

493
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,038
Ms. Lee,

494
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:01,790
can you hear me?

495
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:06,753
If you're embarrassed
to stand in front of people,

496
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:09,422
what's truly embarrassing

497
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:11,466
isn't your appearance.

498
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:13,760
What's truly embarrassing

499
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:17,681
is you shrinking yourself under the gaze
of people who don't matter to you

500
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:20,433
and trapping yourself in the words

501
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:22,686
of those who spew them out like waste.

502
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:24,187
Their stares

503
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:25,855
and words

504
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:27,899
carry no meaning,

505
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:30,777
no value, and no responsibility.

506
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:34,281
No one can speak for you, Ms. Lee.

507
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:36,658
Only you can do it.

508
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,868
Please fight alongside
the person you love.

509
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:40,912
I'll help you.

510
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,084
Let's go.

511
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:16,990
Order!

512
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,369
COURT IN SESSION

513
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:23,121
Three years ago, my wife suffered

514
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:26,166
severe burns to her face
and body in an unexpected accident.

515
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,877
It was a tragic accident that happened

516
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:31,212
just as we were planning our wedding.

517
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,471
Will you marry me?

518
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:11,878
My wife, who was my fiancÃ©e at the time,

519
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:16,216
suffered severe burns
to her face and body.

520
00:36:17,467 --> 00:36:19,052
It was incredibly hard on her.

521
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:21,763
Ye-rim!

522
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:24,683
She said she couldn't bear
looking like a monsterâ€¦

523
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:29,604
and disappeared,
saying she wanted to break up with me.

524
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:34,734
She even triedâ€¦

525
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,029
to take her own life.

526
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,454
Please help me.

527
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:49,040
Still, I couldn't let her go.

528
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:51,668
Gi-beom!

529
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:53,169
Please!

530
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:55,797
Just go.

531
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:59,050
Because to me, she was still the personâ€¦

532
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:00,218
I'm begging you.

533
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,347
â€¦I knew and loved.

534
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,936
I didn't want to lose her,

535
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,731
so I followed her persistently.

536
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,608
She would run,
and I would chase after her.

537
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:16,735
Then I'd find her again.

538
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:20,113
After all that chasing and pleading,

539
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:23,074
we finally got back together.

540
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:27,996
Listen carefully, Ye-rim.

541
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:34,544
People will always stare at you.

542
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:37,088
They'll also see me.

543
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,591
And they'll noticeâ€¦

544
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:44,012
the way I'm looking at you.

545
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:46,890
They'll envy you

546
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,768
because you're loved in a wayâ€¦

547
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,855
they've never known.

548
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:58,359
Hold your head high and look at me.

549
00:38:10,497 --> 00:38:12,624
I heard their black tea is really good.

550
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:18,671
I know you love black tea.

551
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:22,467
I was panicking earlier,
but I still looked for a place you'd like,

552
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,220
just to treat you to something delicious.

553
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:28,431
Thank you.

554
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:30,642
Let's start over.

555
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,574
Kang Hyo-min, my darling,

556
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:50,286
will you marry me?

557
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,457
I have something to say.

558
00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:59,087
You're making me nervous.

559
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:01,464
What is it?

560
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,804
Here's the black tea you ordered.

561
00:39:13,268 --> 00:39:16,521
You never know how strong a tea bag is
until you put it in hot water.

562
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:21,860
You can't tell how strong a tea bag is
just by looking at it.

563
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:26,114
The moment hot water touches the tea bag,

564
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:29,409
a deep orange bloom
unfurls from the tea bag.

565
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:33,997
That's when it really shows its strength.

566
00:39:38,585 --> 00:39:41,713
So, what is it that you want to say?

567
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:43,673
I'm not an only child.

568
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:45,091
What?

569
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:48,052
I have an identical twin sister.

570
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:52,640
My sister was born
with a genetic hearing impairment.

571
00:39:54,434 --> 00:39:56,269
You're kidding, right?

572
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:58,438
My mom has three brothers and a sister.

573
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:01,274
My aunt and her husband
are hearing-impaired.

574
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:05,528
My sister was adopted
by my aunt when she was five.

575
00:40:08,031 --> 00:40:10,700
I guess my parents thought
it'd be better for her

576
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:13,620
to grow up with my aunt
rather than among hearing people.

577
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:16,789
So, what are you going to do?

578
00:40:16,873 --> 00:40:18,499
I need to think about this.

579
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:20,752
What is there to think about?

580
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:23,338
Are you saying you will abandon her

581
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,131
because she's hearing-impaired?

582
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:27,759
Watch what you're saying.

583
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,887
Your mother has a point.

584
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:35,016
My sister doesn't have a child,
and she wants to adopt.

585
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,810
It might be better
for my sister's family to raise herâ€¦

586
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:41,522
rather than us hearing people.

587
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:44,567
So you're saying

588
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:48,154
we'll keep Hyo-min, who's perfectly fine,

589
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:50,073
but send Hyo-ju away to your sisterâ€¦

590
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:53,785
because she's disabled.

591
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:05,880
My sister and I looked so alike.

592
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:09,217
Even our parents
used to get us mixed up sometimes.

593
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:12,261
The only difference was our hair.

594
00:41:12,345 --> 00:41:13,888
I had a short bob,

595
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:15,723
and my sister had long hair.

596
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,726
I think Mom and Dad did that on purpose

597
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,561
so they wouldn't mix us up.

598
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:21,521
KANG HYO-MIN

599
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:25,066
That day, I thought
if we looked exactly the same,

600
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,945
they wouldn't be able to send her away.

601
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:31,447
That's why

602
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:34,075
I cut her hair and made a big mess.

603
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:49,549
No! Don't take Hyo-ju away!

604
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:57,056
Don't take Hyo-ju away!

605
00:41:58,266 --> 00:42:01,352
Don't take Hyo-ju away!

606
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:05,940
Let me get this straight.

607
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:09,277
Your identical twin has
a hereditary hearing disability,

608
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,112
and she was adopted by your aunt,

609
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,573
who is also hearing-impaired.

610
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:17,326
And you're telling me all this just now?

611
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:19,287
I wasn't trying to hide it.

612
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:22,999
I never found the right moment.

613
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,796
Give me some time to think.

614
00:42:29,756 --> 00:42:30,882
Time to think?

615
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:33,926
I need some time
to process this new information.

616
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:35,845
Okay.

617
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,973
Let's go before traffic gets bad.

618
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:43,352
Let's have dinner some other time.
I'm swamped with work.

619
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:54,947
The same goes for love.

620
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:57,492
You won't know how strong it is

621
00:42:58,451 --> 00:43:00,369
until it's tested in boiling water.

622
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:06,125
After all my pleading and chasing,

623
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:09,170
we began talking
about getting married again.

624
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:14,425
But while preparing for the wedding,

625
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:17,345
even while trying on wedding dresses,

626
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:21,307
Ye-rim couldn't bring herself
to look in the mirror.

627
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:24,519
Thenâ€¦

628
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,437
-Gi-beom, let's go.
-Ye-rim.

629
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:28,856
Ye-rim.

630
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:31,150
My wife started to get better.

631
00:43:32,068 --> 00:43:33,194
It may have been Seo-yeon,

632
00:43:34,237 --> 00:43:35,154
our niece.

633
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:40,827
I think it started when
my wife's younger sister had a daughter.

634
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:44,622
Seeing Seo-yeon,
the spitting image of her sister,

635
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:49,293
she slowly began to brighten up,
filled with hope

636
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:51,963
that she could one day have a child

637
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:54,632
who resembledâ€¦

638
00:43:56,551 --> 00:43:58,386
the way she looked before the burns.

639
00:44:00,513 --> 00:44:02,140
Everything startedâ€¦

640
00:44:03,683 --> 00:44:05,351
to brighten up miraculously.

641
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:07,854
Then,

642
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:12,066
I got diagnosed with testicular cancer
a month before our wedding.

643
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:18,656
I had to get surgery immediately,
or it could have been life-threatening.

644
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:23,077
The doctor said I could make
a full recoveryâ€¦

645
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:26,789
but I could become infertile.

646
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:28,499
I knew

647
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:32,044
how desperately my wife wanted
to have a child,

648
00:44:32,128 --> 00:44:33,796
so I was devastated.

649
00:44:36,299 --> 00:44:37,383
But my wifeâ€¦

650
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,388
was actually calmer than I was.

651
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:44,473
She said it was okay.

652
00:44:44,974 --> 00:44:46,392
She reassured me.

653
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:50,354
She said that
thanks to technology these days,

654
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:53,191
we could store the sperm
and get the surgery.

655
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:55,067
So we wentâ€¦

656
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:01,991
to Hoseon Fertility Clinic,
which claimed to be

657
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:04,577
the best in the field.

658
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:05,912
TOP INFERTILITY SPECIALISTS

659
00:45:05,995 --> 00:45:08,247
Sperm freezing may sound complicated,

660
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:09,498
but it really isn't.

661
00:45:09,582 --> 00:45:11,209
It's a very simple procedure.

662
00:45:11,876 --> 00:45:14,795
The coordinator explained
everything clearly and professionally.

663
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:15,796
SPERM FREEZING

664
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:16,881
Above all,

665
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:19,634
they said they had
the world's best preservation clinic.

666
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:21,928
I knew this was it after the consultation.

667
00:45:22,595 --> 00:45:24,263
There was no reason to hesitate.

668
00:45:26,182 --> 00:45:28,309
So we made a decision on the spot.

669
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:35,149
We truly believed Hoseon Clinic
would live up to its reputation

670
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:38,861
and take care of everything,
just as sincerely as we hoped.

671
00:45:38,945 --> 00:45:40,738
OPERATING ROOM

672
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:43,074
-After leaving the sperm in their careâ€¦
-It'll be fine.

673
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:47,078
â€¦I could go into surgery
with a little more peace of mind.

674
00:45:48,663 --> 00:45:50,581
The surgery went very well.

675
00:45:50,665 --> 00:45:52,917
I'm so glad. Thank you, Doctor.

676
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:54,293
Butâ€¦

677
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:58,965
But as feared,

678
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:02,134
I became infertile.

679
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:07,807
Even so, we weren't too discouraged.

680
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:09,433
Hoseon Fertility Clinic still had

681
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:12,144
the sperm we had entrusted to them.

682
00:46:12,228 --> 00:46:13,521
Butâ€¦

683
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:16,649
Butâ€¦

684
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:19,860
The sperm got ruined.

685
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:24,198
Due to the plaintiff's careless handlingâ€¦

686
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:27,243
WITNESS STAND

687
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:30,371
Everything fell apart.

688
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:32,999
The person I loveâ€¦

689
00:46:38,254 --> 00:46:40,715
has endured unimaginable painâ€¦

690
00:46:43,092 --> 00:46:45,511
just with the hope
of having a child who resembles her.

691
00:46:48,681 --> 00:46:50,891
I was so afraidâ€¦

692
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:55,688
she might leave me again.

693
00:46:57,732 --> 00:46:59,150
But Hoseon Fertility Clinicâ€¦

694
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:03,404
Instead of apologizing to usâ€¦

695
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:06,824
I said we'd do the procedure again.

696
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:08,993
We'll cover the cost.

697
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:10,161
What?

698
00:47:11,287 --> 00:47:12,705
Do you hear yourself?

699
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:15,207
I told you. I'm infertile!

700
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:18,878
But this is not our fault.

701
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:22,381
-Look.
-Please stop making a scene.

702
00:47:22,465 --> 00:47:24,717
-You people are crazy!
-Gi-beom, let's justâ€¦

703
00:47:25,343 --> 00:47:26,886
talk outside, okay?

704
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:29,847
They were whispering among themselves.

705
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:32,183
Let's go for now.

706
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:34,143
Look at her. How can she have a baby?

707
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:36,103
What if the baby
turns out to be a monster?

708
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:37,188
Don't be stupid.

709
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:38,731
She can't have always been that way.

710
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:40,691
Then will the baby look fine?

711
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:41,734
I think so.

712
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:46,572
Still, it's better off this way.
The mother is a monster.

713
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:50,659
They called an unborn child a monster.

714
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:55,039
Hearing that made my wife

715
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:58,542
retreat from the world once more.

716
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:01,003
I see.

717
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,298
That's why you made a scene.

718
00:48:10,346 --> 00:48:12,932
Isn't that Mr. Hwang,
a reporter from Hansang Daily?

719
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:17,853
Damn it, you have got to be kidding me.

720
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:23,901
Pursuant to Article 393 of the Civil Act,

721
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:28,280
damages from a breach of obligation are,
as a rule, limited to ordinary damages.

722
00:48:28,823 --> 00:48:32,326
But if the obligor knew or could have
known about special circumstances,

723
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:35,371
they're also liable for special damages.

724
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:37,498
The defendant
repeatedly informed the plaintiff

725
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:38,624
about his wife's burns,

726
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:39,959
the risk of infertility,

727
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:45,756
and the potential that this would be
their last batch of sperm.

728
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,467
Therefore, the plaintiff
could have reasonably foreseen

729
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:50,803
that failure to fulfill the duty
of safekeeping would cause

730
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:52,888
significant harm to the defendant.

731
00:48:53,431 --> 00:48:55,891
Therefore, compensation must be made

732
00:48:55,975 --> 00:48:58,102
for special damages, not ordinary damages.

733
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:00,062
What do we do now?

734
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:03,107
Five hundred million won
is impossible anyway.

735
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:09,071
A loss that took away
one person's hope in lifeâ€¦

736
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:12,992
A loss that stole
their only chance to become parentsâ€¦

737
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:16,996
If you had to put a price on that loss,
how much would it be?

738
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:18,873
Five hundred million won?

739
00:49:19,457 --> 00:49:20,791
Would that be enough?

740
00:49:23,127 --> 00:49:25,171
Do you still believe the 500 million won

741
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:28,924
the defendant is asking for is excessive,

742
00:49:29,008 --> 00:49:31,343
considering the loss they suffered?

743
00:49:33,012 --> 00:49:35,764
We would be cutting off our nose
just to spite our face.

744
00:49:36,265 --> 00:49:38,225
Stop the lawsuit immediately.

745
00:49:42,313 --> 00:49:45,149
Your Honor, we'd like
to request a brief recess.

746
00:49:45,858 --> 00:49:47,193
Granted.

747
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:50,988
We will resume after a short recess.

748
00:49:56,619 --> 00:49:57,620
Thank you.

749
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:06,045
Mr. Yoon, I found the game changer.

750
00:50:07,463 --> 00:50:09,507
The case of Mr. Park's destroyed sperm.

751
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:12,176
I get what you mean,

752
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:14,220
but even with the sperm loss

753
00:50:14,303 --> 00:50:16,972
and burn injuries
considered as special damages,

754
00:50:17,056 --> 00:50:18,599
isn't 500 million won too much?

755
00:50:19,767 --> 00:50:20,768
It is not.

756
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,395
We may be powerless in the ring,

757
00:50:23,479 --> 00:50:25,856
but outside the ring,
our power is news value.

758
00:50:28,734 --> 00:50:31,320
Our opponent is sensitive
to public sentiment.

759
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:34,406
A court ruling was never
what we were after from the start.

760
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:37,868
It was about
gaining leverage in the negotiation.

761
00:50:37,952 --> 00:50:38,869
Excuse me.

762
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:48,379
Hello, Mr. Hwang.
This is Lee Jin-woo from Yullim.

763
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:50,172
Yes, it's been a while.

764
00:50:50,256 --> 00:50:52,716
You see, we're in the middle
of a personal lawsuit

765
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,552
against Hoseon Fertility Clinic,

766
00:50:54,635 --> 00:50:57,263
and the story is quite compelling.

767
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:06,230
Let's have a word.

768
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:14,863
Is Mr. Hwang from Hansang Daily
part of your play?

769
00:51:14,947 --> 00:51:16,073
Yes.

770
00:51:16,657 --> 00:51:22,705
Your client poured billions
into that medical complex project,

771
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:25,791
but public sentiment's not in your favor.

772
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:28,586
In this climate,
one drop of fuel is all it takes.

773
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:30,421
Classic case of overkill.

774
00:51:33,299 --> 00:51:34,383
Let's settle.

775
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:37,094
What are the terms?

776
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:40,598
This case must not be
reported by any media outlet.

777
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:44,810
From this moment on, the defendant
is not to discuss this case with anyone.

778
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:48,981
On that condition, we'll drop
all civil and criminal charges at no cost.

779
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:50,232
We'll take that.

780
00:51:51,275 --> 00:51:54,486
However, this is on the condition
that Hoseon pays Mr. Park

781
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:57,531
100 million won in damages.

782
00:51:58,407 --> 00:52:00,200
Do you think that makes any sense?

783
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:03,078
Or we could proceed.

784
00:52:03,162 --> 00:52:04,204
Look.

785
00:52:04,747 --> 00:52:06,457
To get 100 million after offsets,

786
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,292
the damages should be set at 500 million.

787
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:10,169
You know that's not feasible.

788
00:52:12,755 --> 00:52:14,882
In a lawsuit, it's not about who wins.

789
00:52:15,424 --> 00:52:17,426
It's about who gets hurt less.

790
00:52:18,427 --> 00:52:19,345
Well, then.

791
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,183
One, two, three.

792
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:27,102
Fine, we'll take the deal.

793
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:36,445
Will you take care of Mr. Hwang?

794
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:38,489
Do you have another story to feed him?

795
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:42,034
Do you think
I brought him here with no plan B?

796
00:52:44,078 --> 00:52:46,163
I'll send over the settlement agreement.

797
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:49,249
If it's not signed within three days,
the offer will be void.

798
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:50,209
Okay.

799
00:52:56,882 --> 00:52:58,926
I'll explain inside.

800
00:53:00,094 --> 00:53:01,011
Please.

801
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,684
What?

802
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:51,729
I'm still reviewing the case,
so I haven't written it yet.

803
00:53:51,812 --> 00:53:52,730
Look here.

804
00:53:53,689 --> 00:53:55,107
I gave you three whole days.

805
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:56,692
And today's the deadline.

806
00:53:57,651 --> 00:54:00,404
That deadline was set unilaterally by you,

807
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:03,073
and it was unreasonable from the start.

808
00:54:03,157 --> 00:54:06,910
Even a first-year
could have written it in half a day.

809
00:54:06,994 --> 00:54:09,663
I've looked it over,
but it's a complicated case.

810
00:54:09,747 --> 00:54:10,748
I'll need more time.

811
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:12,791
Tell me how it's so complicated.

812
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:15,377
I can't remember every detail.

813
00:54:15,461 --> 00:54:16,628
What's the key point?

814
00:54:16,712 --> 00:54:18,046
I'll need to look at the document.

815
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:19,089
You said you read it!

816
00:54:19,173 --> 00:54:20,215
Yes.

817
00:54:20,299 --> 00:54:21,216
I did,

818
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:24,553
but I don't have it with me,
so I can't recall the details.

819
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:26,430
Are you messing with me?

820
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:27,723
Why are you yelling at me?

821
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:28,766
What?

822
00:54:28,849 --> 00:54:31,143
This is workplace harassment.

823
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:34,146
What's going on?

824
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:35,314
What is it?

825
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:42,279
I asked him to draft
a statement for a simple case,

826
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:44,239
but he missed the deadline.

827
00:54:44,323 --> 00:54:46,492
-And?
-It's not exactly a difficult case.

828
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:48,952
It was a half-day's task,

829
00:54:49,036 --> 00:54:51,246
but he still didn't get
the key points after three days,

830
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:52,539
-so I--
-Okay.

831
00:54:52,623 --> 00:54:54,082
-And?
-Pardon?

832
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:57,503
Who are you to give a task
to my associate and yell at him?

833
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:04,551
This place isn't a free shelter.
He's acting like a salary thief--

834
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:05,552
What?

835
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:06,970
Salary thief?

836
00:55:07,054 --> 00:55:08,680
Yes, salary thief.

837
00:55:08,764 --> 00:55:11,725
You really are damn rude.

838
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:13,811
What I mean isâ€¦

839
00:55:14,812 --> 00:55:15,813
What's going on?

840
00:55:20,359 --> 00:55:22,778
Who said he could assign work
to my associate?

841
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:25,155
Did you say it was okay to do so?

842
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:26,156
Yes.

843
00:55:27,491 --> 00:55:30,536
Associates without enough billable hours
can be shared between teams.

844
00:55:30,619 --> 00:55:31,745
Says who?

845
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:33,163
The relevant committee says so.

846
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:37,459
No wonder he doesn't know.
He's always out playing golf.

847
00:55:37,543 --> 00:55:40,796
That gives you the right to treat
associates with low hours like this?

848
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:41,880
Yes.

849
00:55:41,964 --> 00:55:44,842
I can't keep enabling a salary thief.

850
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:46,718
Did you two set this up?

851
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:50,347
There's no excuse
for that kind of verbal attack.

852
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:53,934
Using phrases like "salary thief"
is just plain disrespectful.

853
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:55,978
It's your behavior that creates

854
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:59,690
the perfect environment
for parasites like that to thrive.

855
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,484
I can smell the rot of corruption
coming from you.

856
00:56:03,402 --> 00:56:06,530
I'm worried
it might affect my associates too.

857
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:09,700
That's some strong language you're using.

858
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:13,871
You clearly don't know
whose son Na Dong-su is.

859
00:56:13,954 --> 00:56:15,873
Can you handle the consequences?

860
00:56:16,832 --> 00:56:20,919
Let's base our sales on actual competence.

861
00:56:21,003 --> 00:56:23,005
And stop dragging in
a bunch of salary thieves.

862
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:25,465
Yoon Seok-hoon!

863
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:40,731
How could grinders like you

864
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:44,401
ever understand
how rainmakers like us feel, right?

865
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:47,487
That's why you'll never
be anything more than a grinder.

866
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:52,910
Who is that?

867
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:54,995
Ko Tae-seop?

868
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:56,413
Don't you know?

869
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:58,457
He's the son of a named partner.

870
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:01,793
-Which one?
-What's the English name of Yullim?

871
00:57:01,877 --> 00:57:04,046
Shin, Ko & Kim.

872
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:07,883
Exactly. He's the son of "Ko."

873
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:10,677
Right, Attorney Ko Seung-cheol.

874
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:13,096
What do "grinder" and "rainmaker" mean?

875
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:16,850
Rainmakers are attorneys
in sales positions

876
00:57:16,934 --> 00:57:19,561
who bring in new cases.

877
00:57:19,645 --> 00:57:21,647
And grinders are the attorneys

878
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:23,607
who handle the cases brought in by others.

879
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:28,403
When you come
from a good family like Mr. Na,

880
00:57:28,487 --> 00:57:30,489
just existing is enough to earn respect.

881
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:32,824
You wouldn't know that, would you?

882
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:34,534
Right.

883
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:37,120
So that's what rainmaker means?

884
00:57:37,204 --> 00:57:39,665
Hijacking companies that came to us
for our competence,

885
00:57:39,748 --> 00:57:41,333
slapping your name on the deal

886
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:44,086
just because
you have an acquaintance there,

887
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:48,048
and landing contracts
by dragging in salary thieves?

888
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:49,132
Watch what you say.

889
00:57:49,216 --> 00:57:50,384
You littleâ€¦

890
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:51,760
Don't get worked up.

891
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:54,262
-That only means you admit it.
-How dare you--

892
00:57:54,346 --> 00:57:55,681
Let me.

893
00:57:57,015 --> 00:58:00,560
Do you think your competence
is your power?

894
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:02,938
Don't get cocky just because you're good.

895
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:06,024
It's not that big a deal.

896
00:58:06,108 --> 00:58:07,567
You could end up like your mentor.

897
00:58:07,651 --> 00:58:09,403
Do you want me to send you

898
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:11,738
to a small company
as their in-house counsel?

899
00:58:13,991 --> 00:58:15,534
A lot of people are watching.

900
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:17,744
So are you admitting it publicly?

901
00:58:17,828 --> 00:58:18,745
Admit what?

902
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:23,959
That you schemed to have

903
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:27,963
Attorney Kwon Na-yeon
pushed out to a small company

904
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:30,257
as their in-house counsel?

905
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:38,181
Attorney Kwon Na-yeon?

906
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:41,309
The one who won
the Legal Award two years ago?

907
00:58:41,393 --> 00:58:42,310
Yes.

908
00:58:42,394 --> 00:58:44,271
Kwon Na-yeon.

909
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:46,356
Her name itself is a brand.

910
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:51,361
Jeez.

911
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:53,196
What an arrogant prick.

912
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,615
Are you seriously
letting him act that way?

913
00:58:55,699 --> 00:58:56,658
Of course not.

914
00:58:57,409 --> 00:58:59,244
I need to show him who's backing me.

915
00:58:59,995 --> 00:59:00,912
That jerk.

916
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:12,174
You're representing Hansu Marine

917
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:15,761
in an international arbitration case
against the global energy company Mobiler.

918
00:59:15,844 --> 00:59:19,306
In cross-border deals, arbitration is
often preferred over litigation nowadays.

919
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:20,265
KWON NA-YEON

920
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:22,184
What is the reason for that?

921
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:25,228
Companies prefer
arbitration over litigation

922
00:59:25,312 --> 00:59:27,230
because it's private, faster,

923
00:59:27,314 --> 00:59:30,067
and offers more procedural flexibility.

924
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:32,527
It's also easier
to enforce internationally,

925
00:59:32,611 --> 00:59:34,821
and the rulings are final and binding.

926
00:59:35,322 --> 00:59:36,364
I see.

927
00:59:36,448 --> 00:59:38,033
I guess this case could be

928
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:41,328
a great reference
for Yullim Law Firm as well.

929
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:43,789
How was it received internally?

930
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:01,306
Hey, Seol-a.

931
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:03,183
I'm swamped with work now.

932
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:05,769
My friend is going on
a blind date with a lawyer.

933
01:00:06,353 --> 01:00:08,313
She knows you're
my roommate and a lawyer,

934
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:10,357
so she asked me to check his reputation.

935
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,317
Fine. Give me his name.

936
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,277
I'll ask around after I finish work.

937
01:00:14,361 --> 01:00:15,779
Well, it'sâ€¦

938
01:00:17,197 --> 01:00:18,281
Out with it.

939
01:00:18,365 --> 01:00:19,616
I have an urgent task--

940
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:21,868
It's Han Seong-chan
from Lee & Seo Law Firm.

941
01:00:23,829 --> 01:00:26,206
She's going on a blind date
with Han Seong-chan.

942
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:28,750
What?

943
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:46,601
I wish there were a copyright
on the word "love"

944
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:50,814
so people like you
wouldn't be able to use it carelessly.

945
01:00:56,278 --> 01:00:57,821
Let's talk for a minute.

946
01:01:01,032 --> 01:01:05,328
You. Good luck dating him.

947
01:01:05,412 --> 01:01:08,290
He's an asshole.

948
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:15,630
Who is that hearing-impaired woman?

949
01:01:15,714 --> 01:01:17,215
Do you know her?

950
01:02:10,769 --> 01:02:12,103
Can I use the hot water?

951
01:02:14,856 --> 01:02:16,483
I asked if I could use the hot water.

952
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:17,442
Sure.

953
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:20,779
What are you doing at this hour?

954
01:02:20,862 --> 01:02:22,072
Any urgent work?

955
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:24,032
The Sammun Construction
unjust enrichment brief

956
01:02:24,115 --> 01:02:26,159
is due tomorrow morning.

957
01:02:30,205 --> 01:02:31,414
Would you like some tea?

958
01:02:35,502 --> 01:02:37,170
Yes, please.

959
01:02:37,254 --> 01:02:38,129
Thank you.

960
01:02:55,981 --> 01:03:00,402
Mr. Park Gi-beom is a great guy.

961
01:03:02,696 --> 01:03:07,200
I hope they live happily ever after.

962
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:20,338
How would you feel
if you were in that situation?

963
01:03:24,968 --> 01:03:26,386
Mr. Park's wifeâ€¦

964
01:03:30,515 --> 01:03:31,766
How would I feel

965
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:34,978
if my partner suffered
burns on her face and all over her body?

966
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:36,229
Yes.

967
01:03:38,773 --> 01:03:40,692
I'd go nuts from heartbreak.

968
01:03:44,195 --> 01:03:45,405
Would you turn away from her?

969
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:51,828
When the looks or circumstances
of your loved one change,

970
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:54,873
your love changes as well.

971
01:03:59,002 --> 01:04:00,420
Do you honestly believe that?

972
01:04:01,046 --> 01:04:02,505
I hope that's not the case,

973
01:04:04,299 --> 01:04:05,425
but I get it.

974
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:14,017
I'd love to say that's not true,

975
01:04:15,769 --> 01:04:17,145
but I'm not sure either.

976
01:04:17,771 --> 01:04:18,730
There are things

977
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:22,442
you can only understand when you're
faced with such extreme situations.

978
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:25,362
But you see,

979
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:29,532
when the person you love is in crisis

980
01:04:30,033 --> 01:04:31,659
and you walk away,

981
01:04:32,452 --> 01:04:35,372
it's not about love anymore.
It just makes you a disloyal bastard.

982
01:04:43,088 --> 01:04:44,422
I guess you're right.

983
01:04:52,639 --> 01:04:53,890
Let's get going.

984
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:58,520
Thank you for the tea.

985
01:05:04,651 --> 01:05:06,069
About Mr. Park's caseâ€¦

986
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:07,028
Yes?

987
01:05:10,073 --> 01:05:11,116
You did well.

988
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:12,992
Thank you.

989
01:06:03,877 --> 01:06:06,963
BEYOND THE BAR

990
01:06:09,757 --> 01:06:11,968
His mother filed
a civil and criminal lawsuit

991
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:14,095
against the delivery company and driver.

992
01:06:14,179 --> 01:06:15,889
So, the plaintiff's doctor claims

993
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:18,558
the plaintiff shows symptoms
consistent with a collision,

994
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:21,811
despite the fact
that the delivery truck in question

995
01:06:21,895 --> 01:06:23,062
made no physical contact.

996
01:06:23,146 --> 01:06:25,857
No collision, but the injuries
are consistent with one?

997
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:27,192
Is that even possible?

998
01:06:27,275 --> 01:06:29,027
Did you have to say all that?

999
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:31,070
You acted like you wanted to hurt her.

1000
01:06:31,154 --> 01:06:32,030
Verbal blows are fine,

1001
01:06:32,113 --> 01:06:33,823
but the wrong hit could be fatal.

1002
01:06:33,907 --> 01:06:36,034
The truth can be poison
if it's used like one.

1003
01:06:36,117 --> 01:06:37,827
Ms. Kang, tread carefully.

1004
01:06:43,166 --> 01:06:45,168
