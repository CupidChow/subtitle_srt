1
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:35,953
BEYOND THE BAR

2
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:41,018
AN EYE FOR AN EYE, A TOOTH FOR A TOOTH

3
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:44,896
-Good shot!
-Great!

4
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:45,856
It's almost there!

5
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,274
It's so close.

6
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:48,483
Good shot!

7
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:50,277
-Impressive.
-Just make your approach shot.

8
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,404
-It's going all the way.
-Mr. Choi.

9
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,449
Let me get straight to the point.

10
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,867
Please.

11
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:58,702
I only like the best.

12
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:00,120
I see.

13
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:04,166
That's why I work
with Korea's top law firm, Lee & Seo.

14
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:08,420
We, Yullim, still have
a long way to go, Mr. Choi.

15
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:13,216
I owe Mr. Ko Seung-cheol
a great deal personally.

16
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,303
That's why I'm giving you this chance.

17
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,388
Thank you so much.

18
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:19,348
We'll do our best.

19
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:20,766
Don't thank me yet.

20
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,144
Sorry?

21
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:25,979
There's a condition.

22
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:28,315
What kind of…

23
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,943
Something bothersome came up on my end,

24
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:33,862
and I need someone to deal with it.

25
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,822
No problem. We're on it.

26
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:37,115
Mr. Hong Do-yun here…

27
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,325
-No.
-He…

28
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,827
There's someone I want.

29
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:42,496
Who…

30
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,456
Mr. Yoon Seok-hoon.

31
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:50,253
His track record isn't so great…

32
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:53,674
I heard he has a high win rate
and handles his work with precision.

33
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:55,092
Right…

34
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:56,802
That's my condition.

35
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:00,389
If Mr. Yoon takes on my personal case,

36
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:03,058
I'll entrust COMO Fund's
SMR-focused investment deal

37
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:05,268
to Yullim, not Lee & Seo Law Firm.

38
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,567
Here, sir.

39
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,237
Excuse me, I need to use the restroom.

40
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,865
-Take your time, sir.
-Take your time.

41
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:21,952
My goodness.

42
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:22,953
What do we do?

43
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,622
Why does it have to be Yoon Seok-hoon?

44
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:26,832
I doubt he'd do it.

45
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,793
I'll make him do it.

46
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,754
The division head of Litigation
is Kim Yul-seong,

47
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:34,131
my father's right-hand man.

48
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,424
That's right.

49
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:38,301
That means he'll be on your side.

50
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:39,344
I'd say so.

51
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:42,514
Mr. Yoon may not listen to me,

52
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:43,849
but he listens to Mr. Kim.

53
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,016
-He does?
-Yes.

54
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:45,976
I guess so.

55
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,145
Mr. Kim Yul-seong was the mentor
of Ms. Kwon Na-yeon,

56
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,272
who was Mr. Yoon's mentor.

57
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:51,356
Jeez.

58
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,443
Why Yoon of all people?

59
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,620
Come on in.

60
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:08,165
You heard, right?

61
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,417
Mr. Ko here

62
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,502
brought in COMO Fund as our client.

63
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,087
Not yet, Mr. Kim.

64
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:17,799
That's only possible
if our great Mr. Yoon lends us a hand.

65
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:19,342
Then it's a done deal.

66
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:22,554
This is Mr. Choi Cheol-min.

67
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:24,806
He's the founder and CEO of COMO Fund.

68
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:30,687
This is Mr. Yoon Seok-hoon,
our top litigation attorney.

69
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:33,231
I've heard a lot about you.

70
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:35,692
That you're a great attorney.

71
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:37,944
Thank you.

72
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:40,906
But…

73
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,618
shouldn't the COMO Fund case be handled

74
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,411
by the M&A team, not Litigation?

75
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:47,496
Yes.

76
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:51,833
The SMR investment deal
will be handled by the M&A team.

77
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:53,376
The reason I called you here

78
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,880
is because Mr. Choi
has a personal litigation case.

79
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:01,218
Now that our expert's here,
please go ahead.

80
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,844
I want to file a defamation lawsuit.

81
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:05,430
Against whom?

82
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:06,723
My housekeeper.

83
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,603
What happened?

84
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,231
It's…

85
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,983
Please feel free to tell us.

86
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:21,780
She reported me to the police
for abusing my daughter.

87
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,491
She even went to the media.

88
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:28,995
With help from people around me,
I got through it without major trouble.

89
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,915
But if I let this slide,
she might cause even more trouble.

90
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,459
Is that why you're suing her?

91
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:35,544
I'm not sure.

92
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:38,547
I'm not a fan of drama or complications,

93
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:42,676
so I'd prefer to settle this quietly
without taking it to court.

94
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,887
Whether it's legal pressure
or lawful intimidation,

95
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,557
can't we resolve it that way?

96
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,768
She must be acting that way
because she's holding something over you.

97
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,436
She says she took pictures.

98
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,189
-Pictures?
-Yes.

99
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:57,357
Do you have them?

100
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,775
Yes.

101
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:08,618
Gosh…

102
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,456
How did she…

103
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,416
I don't know.

104
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:18,086
Bruises or cuts…
Those can easily be faked with makeup.

105
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:21,256
I'm too busy to spend much time
with my daughter,

106
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:25,302
but she's with her every day.
She could easily fabricate anything.

107
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:27,721
In situations like this,

108
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:31,141
the one with more to lose
becomes the weaker side.

109
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,018
When the media gets the story wrong,

110
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,312
the truth no longer matters.

111
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,814
If the company's image is damaged,

112
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:40,775
it won't just hurt me.
It will affect the investors too.

113
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:42,527
I need to be careful.

114
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:44,821
I'm sure.

115
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:48,700
Looks like you're
dealing with a nasty one here.

116
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:51,077
I thought about
just paying her to stop this,

117
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:52,871
but I realized it might look

118
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:55,457
like I was admitting
to something that I didn't do.

119
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,626
So I couldn't risk that.

120
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:03,924
Word is, there's a VIP among
the real investors behind COMO Fund.

121
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,384
Many political elites
are somehow involved,

122
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:09,638
and so are several entrepreneurs
with roots in organized crime.

123
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:14,517
Mr. Choi Cheol-min doesn't seem like
someone who would do that to his daughter.

124
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:17,562
He comes off as a sweet guy in the media.

125
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:19,981
To put it bluntly,

126
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:22,067
he's so powerful
that it wouldn't be surprising

127
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,569
if he killed someone and walked free.

128
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:25,862
MR. KIM YUL-SEONG

129
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,660
Hello, Mr. Kim.

130
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:36,206
He said he'd accept
the 500 million won retainer fee

131
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,832
we suggested to Mr. Choi.

132
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,042
I see.

133
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:42,253
He said the retainer was a bit high,

134
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:44,339
but he'll go along with your request.

135
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,049
So?

136
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,926
I'll take the case.

137
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:49,803
Okay.

138
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:55,475
The COMO Fund fee is finalized.
Go ahead and proceed.

139
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:57,310
Are you really doing this?

140
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:02,649
Did Mr. Yoon seriously take that case?

141
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,275
Yes. I don't get it.

142
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,696
You know his policy
on cases involving children.

143
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:08,655
I know.

144
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:11,741
He never takes cases
involving child abuse, domestic violence,

145
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,451
or animal cruelty, no matter what.

146
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:17,747
And if Mr. Yoon ends up winning this case,

147
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:20,750
then COMO Fund will become
Mr. Ko Tae-seop's client.

148
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,128
That would instantly
make him number one in revenue.

149
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:26,548
With his father being a founder,
and that kind of achievement…

150
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,049
That'll make him a managing partner.

151
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,802
Then we'll…

152
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:35,223
Hey, don't worry.

153
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:37,392
You know what Mr. Yoon is like.

154
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,187
Here you are.

155
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:42,564
What is it?

156
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,858
Mr. Kim Yul-seong wants you
in the meeting room.

157
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,652
I don't have any meetings today.
Is it an internal meeting?

158
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:48,778
No.

159
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:51,906
It's your new client.
I think it's a divorce case.

160
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:54,200
She's a walk-in.

161
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,078
Bye.

162
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,294
Don't worry too much.

163
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,797
-We'll do our best for this case.
-Okay.

164
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:09,549
Yes.

165
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:10,633
Come in.

166
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:12,844
This is our new client
in the divorce case--

167
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,137
What are you doing here?

168
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:17,807
Do you two know each other?

169
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,225
It's been a while.

170
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:20,727
I said, what are you doing here?

171
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,064
What's going on?

172
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:27,859
I'm sorry, but would you
mind giving us a moment?

173
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,952
Who is she? Why is Ms. Heo so serious?

174
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,288
What's going on?

175
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,874
It's nothing.

176
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,168
My gosh, so scary.

177
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,045
Who is?

178
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:48,797
Ms. Heo Min-jeong?

179
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:50,173
Yes.

180
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,510
Honestly, she scares me more than my wife.

181
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:58,139
And who is she?

182
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,058
That's the divorce case client.

183
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:03,228
She said she came
because of my reputation.

184
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,021
I bet it was Ms. Heo's reputation.

185
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,983
I mean,
you're an incredible named partner.

186
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:10,193
Look how she came to see you.

187
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:13,571
-Thanks.
-Sure.

188
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:16,574
She came here for a divorce case,

189
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,493
and it looks like they're acquaintances.

190
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:19,828
It seemed pretty intense.

191
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:21,955
Is that so?

192
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,923
Next is a defense case in a recourse claim

193
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:34,384
filed by insurance companies
that paid compensation

194
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,427
to victims of the Pohang earthquake.

195
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,180
I guess we'll need to go
meet the defendants in Pohang.

196
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:42,684
Yes. I'll take Mr. Ji,
Mr. Oh, and Ms. Choi.

197
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,811
As it happens, the Labor Office hearing

198
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,730
for the Pohang Mayor case
has been set for around the same time,

199
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:50,942
so we're planning
to stay in Pohang for about a week.

200
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:52,861
Okay.

201
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,071
You'll be so lonely, Hyo-min.

202
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,281
With all of us in Pohang,

203
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,658
you'll be the only one
working at the office.

204
00:10:58,741 --> 00:10:59,993
Quiet.

205
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,286
Yes, sir!

206
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:02,704
Next.

207
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:05,665
Next is a criminal complaint filed
by Mr. Choi Cheol-min,

208
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:08,251
CEO of COMO Fund,
against his housekeeper for defamation

209
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,378
and related charges,
under reference number 273-17.

210
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:11,337
Right.

211
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:14,090
How shall I proceed?

212
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,677
Get me a meeting with the housekeeper.

213
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:30,857
Ms. Kang.

214
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,483
The info on Mr. Choi's housekeeper.

215
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:33,735
7-1, SONGBAEK-RO, JEONGWON-GU

216
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,612
She's not answering her phone.

217
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,488
I need to be in court by two o'clock.

218
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:39,616
Why don't you go meet her first?

219
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,117
Will do.

220
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,494
Just go over there and hear her out.

221
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:46,039
The priority is to figure out
what she's after.

222
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,957
-Okay.
-Ji, Oh, and Choi.

223
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:49,459
-Yes.
-Yes.

224
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,419
We're off to Pohang tomorrow,

225
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,796
so wrap up and submit your tasks
by end of day.

226
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,089
-Okay.
-Yes.

227
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,364
-Excuse me, ma'am.
-Yes?

228
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,868
-Do you know where this is?
-Let's see.

229
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:25,119
I know.

230
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:27,038
You can go up there.

231
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,665
-Right.
-Over there.

232
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:29,666
Up there?

233
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,584
Thank you.

234
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,089
Let's go.

235
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,470
It's somewhere over here.

236
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:44,639
Seven dash one.

237
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:50,937
Hello?

238
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:57,610
Who is it?

239
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:58,695
Hello, sir.

240
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:01,698
KANG HYO-MIN

241
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,367
I'm Kang Hyo-min,
an attorney at Yullim Law Firm.

242
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,536
Is this Ms. Kim Yeong-suk's residence?

243
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,122
Yes. What do you want?

244
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:10,748
Who's at the door?

245
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,293
Some attorney's here.

246
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:14,294
What?

247
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,796
Attorney?

248
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,506
Hello, ma'am.

249
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:26,556
I was just too heartbroken.
I had no choice. I had to do it.

250
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:29,642
That poor thing…

251
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:34,564
It got to a point where checking her

252
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,233
was the first thing I would do
whenever I was there,

253
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,819
wondering how badly
he had beaten her this time,

254
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,446
how painful it must have been,

255
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:43,948
how terrified she would've been…

256
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:50,079
Sometimes while I'm cleaning,
she seems so quiet

257
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,498
that I look over to check on her,

258
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:58,546
only to find her
staring blankly out the window.

259
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:01,132
That's not the face of a six-year-old.

260
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:05,553
Is there any other proof
besides the pictures?

261
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:09,974
I thought about installing
a hidden camera to get some kind of proof,

262
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:12,560
but just surviving
day to day is hard enough.

263
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:16,147
So in the end,
I just took pictures of her injuries.

264
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,149
So is there no direct evidence

265
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:21,110
that Mr. Choi Cheol-min
caused the injuries in the photos?

266
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,988
What else could it be?

267
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:25,907
No one falls that often.

268
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:30,203
Have you actually seen
Mr. Choi Cheol-min hitting the child?

269
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:36,501
He may be rough with the child,
but he's never hit her in front of me.

270
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:40,088
But you can tell by how the child reacts.

271
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:41,964
As soon as her dad shows up,

272
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:45,343
I see the blood drain from her face,
and she hides behind me.

273
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,303
Good God…

274
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:50,848
Honestly, I can't even count
how many times I thought

275
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:53,601
about running away
from that house with her.

276
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:59,065
One day, I went to their house,
but she was nowhere to be seen.

277
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,484
-In-yeong!
-I was looking for her,

278
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,236
wondering if she'd gone out with her dad.

279
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,405
But I found her hiding in the closet.

280
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:06,406
My goodness!

281
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:09,283
He'd beaten her so badly.

282
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:12,453
-Oh dear.
-I cried with her in my arms.

283
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:15,373
I could feel her trembling.

284
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:16,541
In-yeong.

285
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:19,710
I could tell something wasn't right.

286
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:23,339
As I was about
to take her to the hospital,

287
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:26,426
-that devil came home with some guy.
-Yes, Congressman.

288
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:27,427
Have you eaten?

289
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,847
He was afraid of being exposed,

290
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,851
so he had a doctor come home instead.

291
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:38,938
Yes, ma'am.

292
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,565
I forgot to tell you.

293
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:43,901
After that, the doctor kept coming
to the house from time to time

294
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:45,194
to treat her.

295
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:46,821
Yes.

296
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:50,032
He wouldn't send her to daycare
until she made a full recovery.

297
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,582
That's why there are no medical records,

298
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,625
and the daycare had no idea.

299
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:00,960
He's the devil.

300
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,920
He's beyond redemption.

301
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:08,092
I saw that the police report
was dismissed.

302
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:09,802
They're all in it together.

303
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,473
The police even told him
about the report I filed.

304
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:16,684
Now I can't even see In-yeong anymore.

305
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:20,480
Ever since I quit that job,

306
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:22,773
I've been having nightmares nonstop.

307
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:24,108
I get scared

308
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,986
whenever the phone rings,

309
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:30,490
thinking something
might have happened to In-yeong.

310
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:31,949
So, I decided

311
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,285
to report it to the press…

312
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:37,788
but they ignored it.

313
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:43,336
The housekeeper
seems to be right about everything.

314
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:44,962
It's too early to say for sure.

315
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:47,590
For now, all we have are
Ms. Kim's words and a few photos.

316
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,383
I could see the truth in her eyes.

317
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:52,470
-Are we judging the truth by her gaze?
-Why are we judging the truth?

318
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,430
If things seem suspicious,
we report it first.

319
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,307
Then we let the law decide.

320
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,184
What kind of attorney
reports their own client?

321
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,061
That's a breach of confidentiality

322
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,771
and grounds for disciplinary action.

323
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,439
Is that so important to you?

324
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:06,734
If breaking the law
bothers you so much, I'll report it.

325
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:08,152
Even if I get disciplined--

326
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:09,654
Don't be hasty.

327
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:11,280
Sorry?

328
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,782
You may leave.

329
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:14,408
Mr. Yoon.

330
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,328
Do you have any idea

331
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,914
how anxious I was to tell you
what Mr. Choi did,

332
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,499
the whole way back to the office?

333
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:24,961
I thought you would take immediate action,

334
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,129
that you wouldn't let him
get away with it.

335
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:28,881
Am I a prosecutor?

336
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:30,132
Or a judge?

337
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:31,175
What kind of action?

338
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:35,179
Don't act rashly. Just do your job.

339
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:37,848
Go.

340
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,818
Kang Hyo-min!

341
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,407
You're just a first-year rookie.

342
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,450
Who do you think you are,
speaking up like that?

343
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:59,829
Why did someone like you have to appear
and start stressing me out?

344
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:00,788
What…

345
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:02,498
What's going on?

346
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:03,791
You're the same.

347
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,543
Is this how you handle first-years?

348
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:08,879
Did Kang Hyo-min really go to meet
Mr. Choi's housekeeper by herself?

349
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:10,881
Yes.

350
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:14,218
What were you thinking,
sending a clueless first-year newcomer

351
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:16,137
to handle that alone? You bast…

352
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,096
Did anything happen?

353
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,180
Read this.

354
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:19,932
Read it!

355
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:27,064
One of your attorneys just dropped by.

356
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:29,025
You're done now.

357
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,527
I told her everything,

358
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,404
and she promised she'd save In-yeong

359
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,448
and make sure you get punished.

360
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,325
I'm going all the way.

361
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:39,493
Send me the money right now.

362
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:40,620
I mean…

363
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:42,496
She's a money-hungry woman,

364
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:46,417
and you stabbed our client in the back
to give her more ammo!

365
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,670
Absolutely ridiculous.

366
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:53,466
God damn it!

367
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:12,318
You big dummy.

368
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,612
Why are you so down
over something like this?

369
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,448
Mr. Lee.

370
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:19,033
Apparently, Ms. Kim Yeong-suk

371
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,118
not only went through his wallet

372
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:23,913
but also took and sold an expensive watch.

373
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,999
But Mr. Choi Cheol-min said he'd let it go

374
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,709
since she took good care of his daughter.

375
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:31,712
But in the end,
she even stole from his safe.

376
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:34,632
So he told her it was time to quit,

377
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,050
and she held a grudge

378
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,761
and threatened to report him

379
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,763
for child abuse.

380
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:44,016
Here.

381
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:47,812
I looked into Ms. Kim's criminal record.

382
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,855
She's a known fraud and thief.

383
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:52,108
She didn't strike me as the type.

384
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,694
This is so tough.

385
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:58,030
By the way,

386
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:00,157
this won't bankrupt
Choi Cheol-min, will it?

387
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:02,785
I mean…

388
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,746
He owes me some money.

389
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:10,459
Gosh, I shouldn't have brought that up.

390
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:13,462
You must be busy.
Thank you for stopping by.

391
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:29,812
Yes?

392
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,365
I checked
Ms. Kim Yeong-suk's criminal record.

393
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:44,493
I apologize.

394
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:47,788
I let my emotions
get the best of me earlier.

395
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:50,124
It won't happen again.

396
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:56,881
The fact that Ms. Kim
committed theft and fraud in the past

397
00:20:56,964 --> 00:21:00,885
should not be overinterpreted as proof
that Mr. Choi didn't abuse his daughter.

398
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:04,096
Someone who seems bad
can still act out of goodwill,

399
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:07,349
while someone who seems good

400
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:10,060
may still do harm.

401
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:13,731
I'll remember that.

402
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:17,193
You may leave.

403
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:18,986
Yes, Mr. Yoon.

404
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,678
You really shouldn't have.

405
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:47,139
You didn't need to come
all the way to my house.

406
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,267
I owe you an apology.

407
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:52,019
I should have managed my associate better.

408
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,354
It's fine.

409
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:55,189
We've still got time.

410
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:58,776
She's as sly as a snake.
I bet she put on quite the waterworks.

411
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,320
She's so good at acting.

412
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,280
You'd get fooled by her too.

413
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:05,699
I trust you'll handle it smoothly

414
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:09,370
and keep any unnecessary noise
to a minimum, given your competence.

415
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:10,329
Sure.

416
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:16,001
I didn't want to show up empty-handed,

417
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:18,879
so I bought this for your daughter.

418
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:21,799
My daughter?

419
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:24,760
Ms. Hwang.

420
00:22:27,555 --> 00:22:28,848
Ms. Hwang!

421
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,683
Yes, sir.

422
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,228
Yes.

423
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:35,980
What's In-yeong doing now?

424
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,440
She'll be in her room.

425
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:02,882
She's pretty shy.

426
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:05,926
Come on.

427
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,469
Say hi to Dad's friend.

428
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:14,602
Say it out loud.

429
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,521
Hello.

430
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:23,402
Hi, In-yeong.

431
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:41,253
This is for you.

432
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:46,967
What are you doing?

433
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:49,386
Say "thank you."

434
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,516
Say it out loud!

435
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:57,603
Thank you.

436
00:23:58,395 --> 00:23:59,271
Sure.

437
00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:18,791
Where is her mother?

438
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,586
I don't want to talk about that bitch.

439
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:24,964
I'm playing golf

440
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:27,841
with CEO Nam Gyu-cheol
of Namun Group this weekend.

441
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:29,218
Care to join us?

442
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:31,220
Mr. Nam

443
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:34,640
has been struggling lately
with a shareholder derivative lawsuit.

444
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:37,142
I put in a good word for you.

445
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:39,228
Why don't you discuss it over golf?

446
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:41,063
Sure.

447
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:43,649
Thank you for your consideration.

448
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:44,942
I'll join you.

449
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:00,958
Ms. Kang.

450
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,628
-Hello.
-Hello.

451
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,256
It was so hard to find this place.

452
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,717
I'm not used to bustling places like this.

453
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,510
I see.

454
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:13,512
I was told my travel expenses
would be covered.

455
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,431
We'll pay you after this.

456
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:21,311
What's going on?

457
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:26,483
Honestly, I'm confused
about what kind of person you are.

458
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:33,240
Did he say I'm a thief
with a criminal record?

459
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:36,702
Right.

460
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:39,747
I didn't come from a good family,
and I married the wrong man.

461
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:42,624
That's how I ended up
committing fraud and theft.

462
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:46,128
But I'm also the kind of person
who can't just walk past

463
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:49,089
a stray cat out in the rain,
hungry and cold.

464
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:51,884
I'm only trying to save In-yeong

465
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,011
from that evil man.

466
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:59,224
Are you saying you're not after money?

467
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:02,978
Why did you quit the job?

468
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:04,855
-That's--
-Didn't you get caught

469
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:08,067
by the police while trying
to steal 50 million won in cash

470
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:10,527
from Mr. Choi's house?

471
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:12,613
That was a trap.

472
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:15,282
The moment I heard
the abuse report had been dismissed,

473
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:18,952
I knew I had to run away
with his daughter.

474
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:20,245
But…

475
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:25,584
I had no money, no savings.

476
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:28,962
That's when I noticed the safe.

477
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:31,381
It had always been locked,

478
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:33,425
but it happened to be open that day.

479
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:37,346
Just as I left the house
with the money and the girl,

480
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,389
I was faced with the police.

481
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:45,270
But you kept using the abuse
as an excuse to threaten and demand money.

482
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:47,481
I was the one who was threatened!

483
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:50,109
I live paycheck to paycheck.

484
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:52,945
He owed me a month's salary
and didn't even pay my severance.

485
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,905
I was only asking
for the money I was owed,

486
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:56,907
but he turned it around

487
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:00,494
and tightened the noose on me!

488
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:09,837
What is this?

489
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,924
This is a complaint outlining the facts
of the defamation and false accusation

490
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:16,718
committed by the accused, Kim Yeong-suk.

491
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:20,889
What?

492
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:25,060
"The accused, Kim Yeong-suk,

493
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:27,396
falsely reported to the authorities
that the complainant,

494
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,565
Choi Cheol-min, had abused
his daughter, Choi In-yeong,

495
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,483
even though no such abuse had occurred,

496
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:34,486
with the intent to extort money
and valuables from him,

497
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,738
committing the crime of false accusation."

498
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:39,324
"The accused, Kim Yeong-suk,
committed the crime of defamation

499
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:41,910
by providing false information
to a reporter from Munjin Daily,

500
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:43,662
falsely claiming that Choi Cheol-min

501
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:45,747
had abused his daughter, Choi In-yeong."

502
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:51,336
"The Criminal Act punishes
those who defame others by spreading

503
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,423
false information through the media

504
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:58,093
with up to seven years' imprisonment
or a fine of up to 15 million won."

505
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:02,014
This devil really hit In-yeong!

506
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:04,141
You piece of trash!

507
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,101
You bastard!

508
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:08,020
Go straight to hell!

509
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:13,483
"Under the Criminal Act,
anyone who openly insults another person

510
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:14,985
shall be subject to imprisonment

511
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:18,780
or detention for up to one year,
or a fine of up to two million won."

512
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:20,532
Let me add the charge of insult as well.

513
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:27,456
We'll be filing a civil lawsuit too.

514
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,416
Paying your husband's debt
is already a struggle.

515
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:32,794
Fines and damages will
only make things tighter.

516
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,130
Can you even afford legal representation?

517
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,640
We'll see you at court, then.

518
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:47,935
What is it that you want?

519
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:51,396
What do you think?

520
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:56,526
Stop stirring the pot.

521
00:28:57,527 --> 00:29:00,239
You pull a stunt like this again,
and you'll be sorry.

522
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:03,116
I'll have you thrown in jail

523
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,701
for blackmail and extortion.

524
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:13,335
COVENANT

525
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:17,965
What is this?

526
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:19,466
It's a covenant.

527
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:23,053
It states that in exchange
for dropping civil and criminal charges,

528
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:27,015
you will not
file any false reports about child abuse.

529
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:30,018
In case of a breach
resulting in harm to my client,

530
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:32,396
you are liable for triple the damages.

531
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:35,440
Read it and stamp your agreement.

532
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:01,550
PARTY B: KIM YEONG-SUK

533
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:34,750
That charisma…

534
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:37,961
You were great.

535
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:40,714
I should work with you more often.

536
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:42,716
You absolutely nailed it.

537
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:46,762
I actually have
a few more tricky matters to deal with.

538
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,431
I'll be in touch with you next week.

539
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:50,432
Sure.

540
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:55,937
Goodbye.

541
00:31:57,707 --> 00:32:01,545
You told me not to read too much
into Ms. Kim's past criminal record.

542
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:03,964
So why did you?

543
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:06,675
Do you do it to pick on the weak

544
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,552
and protect the powerful?

545
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:13,056
Say something.

546
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,474
Say what?

547
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:15,809
Explain yourself.

548
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:17,185
Why should I?

549
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,077
What is it?

550
00:32:34,161 --> 00:32:35,287
Choi Cheol-min…

551
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:37,414
I'll report him myself.

552
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:40,876
Will the police fix everything
just because you report it?

553
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:43,170
If the case is closed with no charges…

554
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,590
All we have are photos.

555
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:48,508
He brought a doctor to his house

556
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:50,802
and framed the housekeeper
to keep her out of the picture.

557
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:51,803
He's meticulous.

558
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:54,055
Most of the COMO Fund

559
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:56,141
came from those in absolute power.

560
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:59,269
He launders their money
and grows it legally.

561
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:03,815
We can never send that bastard to prison
just for hitting his own daughter.

562
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:05,609
If we stir things up,

563
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:08,195
and that bastard ends up going back home…

564
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:10,947
What happens to the kid?

565
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,739
I wasn't mad at you, Ms. Kang.

566
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:56,243
See you tomorrow.

567
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:17,305
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

568
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:18,306
Hello.

569
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:26,815
Hello.

570
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,400
-Hello.
-Hello.

571
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:29,651
Good morning.

572
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:08,940
Hang on.

573
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,813
Why is he so busy?

574
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:46,371
-Hello.
-Hello.

575
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:15,275
-Ms. Seo.
-Yes?

576
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:17,569
Who are those people?

577
00:37:18,111 --> 00:37:20,405
I heard they're financial advisors.

578
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:06,659
Ms. Seo,

579
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,829
did Mr. Yoon go somewhere?

580
00:38:09,913 --> 00:38:13,082
Yes, I was informed
he'll be away for several days.

581
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:14,250
I see.

582
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,255
Good morning.

583
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:24,469
What? Why aren't you eating?

584
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:25,762
Out with it.

585
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:27,138
It's about Mr. Yoon.

586
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:28,264
Okay.

587
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:31,518
He hasn't been in the office for days.

588
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:32,727
And?

589
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:33,853
Probably a business trip.

590
00:38:33,937 --> 00:38:35,104
It's not.

591
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:37,774
They say he has business
outside the office.

592
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,234
Why isn't he back?

593
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,069
Did something happen to him?

594
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:44,239
You should be grateful
your boss isn't showing up to work.

595
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:47,575
I went off on him the other day,

596
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:50,954
and I'm worried
it may be something to do with that.

597
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:51,913
Hello.

598
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,624
As if he'd even flinch.
You're just a newcomer.

599
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:55,667
You're catastrophizing.

600
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,086
What are you so worried about?

601
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,172
Don't tell me…

602
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:03,466
What?

603
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:04,968
You're not, are you?

604
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:06,553
Of course not!

605
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:08,513
He's my boss, and he's married.

606
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:09,597
He even has a kid.

607
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:11,683
Right?

608
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,893
I just thought
maybe you were still shaken up

609
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:16,062
because of Han Seong-chan.

610
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:18,022
Han Seong-chan…

611
00:39:18,648 --> 00:39:21,484
How could he have gone on a blind date
before even breaking up properly?

612
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:22,443
Enough!

613
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:24,195
Is that jerk really worth wasting

614
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:26,990
our precious evening on?

615
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:28,575
-No.
-No.

616
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:31,911
Where could Mr. Yoon be?

617
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:30,845
Where could he be?

618
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:14,931
Is my chair that comfortable?

619
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:20,478
Mr. Yoon!

620
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:24,565
Where have you been?
Why weren't you at work?

621
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:25,733
Why?

622
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:27,485
Did something happen?

623
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:29,153
No.

624
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:30,989
It's just…

625
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:34,534
Must I report my whereabouts
to a newcomer now?

626
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:36,661
No, sir.

627
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:37,954
I'll go.

628
00:41:40,373 --> 00:41:41,416
Ms. Kang Hyo-min.

629
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,209
Yes.

630
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,213
Your eye gunk.

631
00:41:57,432 --> 00:41:58,433
The office is quiet.

632
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,852
Everybody's out
on the Pohang business trip.

633
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:09,027
-You can go.
-Okay.

634
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,180
Yes.

635
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:40,058
Mr. Yoon.

636
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:41,434
Yes?

637
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:44,687
This is awkward.

638
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:50,359
Did something happen?

639
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:51,944
Get this.

640
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:55,031
It seems my daughter went out
when I wasn't home.

641
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:58,951
And someone must have
reported it to the police.

642
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,162
The police are in front of my house.

643
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:05,666
Man, I am in a bind.

644
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:10,171
Did you hit her?

645
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:12,882
Why ask? You already know.

646
00:43:13,466 --> 00:43:15,301
I know you noticed it the other day.

647
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:20,264
You knew everything but took it
for the retainer and the big case. Right?

648
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:23,142
How is she?

649
00:43:24,644 --> 00:43:25,603
Not so good.

650
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:28,940
I can't let the police see her.

651
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:31,901
I'll be right there.

652
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:32,985
You will?

653
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:34,654
I knew it.

654
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:36,823
Thank you.

655
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:47,750
Get Mr. Hwang for me.

656
00:43:47,834 --> 00:43:51,712
His sister gave birth,
so he's in the hospital now.

657
00:43:52,255 --> 00:43:54,173
I thought he told you about that.

658
00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:55,424
Is everything okay?

659
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,051
I can drive.

660
00:43:58,302 --> 00:43:59,303
Come with me.

661
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:00,888
I'll give you the car key.

662
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:01,889
Okay.

663
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:20,867
Wait here.

664
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:34,422
Have you…

665
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:35,798
had lunch?

666
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:37,550
The police…

667
00:44:39,135 --> 00:44:40,261
They just left.

668
00:44:40,887 --> 00:44:43,181
The doorbell rang a few times,
but I didn't answer.

669
00:44:43,264 --> 00:44:44,432
And they just took off.

670
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,726
I haven't done anything wrong,

671
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:49,896
but why does my heart drop
whenever I see the police?

672
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:54,066
I called you for nothing, didn't I?

673
00:44:55,276 --> 00:44:56,569
Let's take care of this properly.

674
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:57,904
What?

675
00:44:57,987 --> 00:44:59,572
The police could come back.

676
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:02,074
We can't let her stay here.

677
00:45:02,992 --> 00:45:04,535
The child herself is evidence.

678
00:45:05,578 --> 00:45:06,871
We need to destroy the evidence.

679
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:09,248
What?

680
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,126
Do you want me to kill my daughter?

681
00:45:13,336 --> 00:45:14,670
I've got a doctor.

682
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,215
I'll send her back after the treatment.

683
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:20,927
Mr. Yoon,

684
00:45:21,469 --> 00:45:22,678
you sure are sharp!

685
00:45:22,762 --> 00:45:24,263
Very meticulous.

686
00:45:25,348 --> 00:45:26,265
Where is she?

687
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:28,100
In her room.

688
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:15,356
It's okay.

689
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:17,984
Come here.

690
00:46:18,985 --> 00:46:20,278
Let's get out of here.

691
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:47,388
I'll get going.

692
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,640
Okay. Thanks.

693
00:46:51,851 --> 00:46:52,810
Wait.

694
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:07,116
Hey, In-yeong.

695
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:09,994
Don't cause any trouble and do as he says.

696
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:14,332
Say "yes" when your dad speaks to you.

697
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:16,667
Say it out loud!

698
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:17,626
Yes.

699
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:21,088
Good. There you go.

700
00:47:28,888 --> 00:47:29,847
You can go.

701
00:47:33,351 --> 00:47:34,685
I'll call you when it's settled.

702
00:48:04,924 --> 00:48:05,966
It's okay.

703
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:33,244
Let's go.

704
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:36,163
Hurry up!

705
00:48:36,247 --> 00:48:37,206
Okay.

706
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:48,884
EMERGENCY ROOM

707
00:49:01,564 --> 00:49:03,399
-Get ready for surgery.
-Yes, Doctor.

708
00:49:05,151 --> 00:49:08,028
-What is it?
-Looks like there's mesenteric bleeding.

709
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:23,085
OPERATING ROOM

710
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:41,479
-How did it go?
-We managed to suture the bleed.

711
00:49:41,562 --> 00:49:43,522
We just beat the clock.

712
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,817
The poor child…

713
00:49:46,901 --> 00:49:49,195
I knew something like this would happen.

714
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:56,160
How did you…

715
00:49:57,495 --> 00:49:58,746
I got a call from him.

716
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:00,748
Mr. Yoon?

717
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:06,086
The day I stamped the covenant,
he came to me and asked for help.

718
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,631
He asked for my help and said

719
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:12,301
that provoking Choi Cheol-min
could put In-yeong in a worse position.

720
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:16,055
He asked a lot of questions
about Choi Cheol-min.

721
00:50:40,913 --> 00:50:42,081
Please follow that car.

722
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:44,184
You piece of shit!

723
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:52,943
You're laughing?

724
00:51:54,153 --> 00:51:55,154
Are you laughing?

725
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:57,906
You bastard.

726
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:06,498
Even a jerk like you gets to be a parent…

727
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,128
-Are you laughing?
-Mr. Yoon!

728
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:12,713
Get off me!

729
00:52:15,049 --> 00:52:17,676
Go ahead, asshole. Keep laughing!

730
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,470
That's enough.

731
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:31,065
Damn it! Have you lost your mind,
you bastard?

732
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:32,733
Sir,

733
00:52:33,484 --> 00:52:35,069
how did you know about this?

734
00:52:36,612 --> 00:52:37,863
Well, shit.

735
00:52:38,906 --> 00:52:41,116
Go ahead and kill that bastard.

736
00:52:41,909 --> 00:52:44,411
You're done, asshole!

737
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:46,413
You don't know who he is, do you?

738
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:52,920
What are you doing?

739
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,755
What the hell are you doing, you thugs?

740
00:52:56,882 --> 00:52:58,759
Let go of me, you bastards!

741
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:00,886
You nearly beat him to death.

742
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:04,973
I thought you called me because
you didn't want to get your hands dirty.

743
00:53:13,774 --> 00:53:14,775
Make sure…

744
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:18,487
you keep your word.

745
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:21,615
You too.

746
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:23,367
For your own sake.

747
00:53:24,702 --> 00:53:25,577
Sure.

748
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:28,414
I'll get you the data by tomorrow.

749
00:53:28,497 --> 00:53:29,832
This is enough.

750
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:32,960
I could tell Choi Cheol-min

751
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:36,922
was skimming my money little by little,

752
00:53:38,674 --> 00:53:39,883
right under my nose.

753
00:53:41,427 --> 00:53:43,595
He set up an SPC in the Cayman Islands

754
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:46,765
and ran it through a feeder fund,
making everything complex.

755
00:53:46,849 --> 00:53:49,685
If it weren't for you,
I'd have been in the dark forever.

756
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:52,938
I'm a brawler turned businessman.

757
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:54,982
That stuff's all gibberish to me.

758
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:57,234
But I doubt
you're in this for charity work.

759
00:53:58,444 --> 00:53:59,445
What do you want?

760
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:05,117
This is Choi Cheol-min's daughter.

761
00:54:05,868 --> 00:54:07,119
She's six years old.

762
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:14,626
PHYSICIAN'S STATEMENT

763
00:54:16,277 --> 00:54:17,629
Is this Choi Cheol-min's doing?

764
00:54:17,713 --> 00:54:19,839
He even brought
a doctor home to treat her,

765
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:22,968
just to keep it all hidden.

766
00:54:27,848 --> 00:54:29,423
"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."

767
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:31,977
Help me bring justice to this.

768
00:54:32,895 --> 00:54:35,856
Then I'll make sure
you get back every penny

769
00:54:36,774 --> 00:54:37,816
he stole from you.

770
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:51,038
You're bleeding…

771
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:22,152
Mr. Yoon!

772
00:57:31,031 --> 00:57:32,199
Mr. Yoon.

773
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:34,576
Are you all right?

774
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:05,232
Don't you need more treatment?

775
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:10,362
I'm good.

776
00:58:11,363 --> 00:58:12,364
Thank you.

777
00:58:15,784 --> 00:58:16,868
Don't mention it.

778
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:23,083
Even a monster like him
gets to be a parent…

779
00:58:27,796 --> 00:58:28,714
In-yeong…

780
00:58:33,844 --> 00:58:35,929
It would have been nice if she were mine.

781
00:58:39,808 --> 00:58:40,851
I agree.

782
00:58:42,436 --> 00:58:43,603
I'm sure

783
00:58:44,271 --> 00:58:46,690
you're a great father.

784
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:50,360
How old is your child?

785
00:58:55,574 --> 00:58:56,575
I don't have a child.

786
00:58:57,826 --> 00:58:58,702
Pardon?

787
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:03,457
Weren't you leaving work early
because you have a child to take care of?

788
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:08,545
I'm co-parenting a dog

789
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:11,381
with my ex-wife.

790
00:59:21,058 --> 00:59:22,142
You can go now.

791
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:23,769
I'll stay here.

792
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:58,261
Choi Cheol-min was hounded by them.

793
00:59:59,513 --> 01:00:00,639
I'M ON VACATION

794
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:02,516
I'LL GET IN TOUCH WHEN I'M BACK

795
01:00:08,522 --> 01:00:09,397
EDIT PROFILE

796
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:15,070
I NEED A BREAK! I'M ON VACATION

797
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:17,280
No one around him noticed anything.

798
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:23,203
It's okay.

799
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:25,413
He got exactly
what he did to his daughter.

800
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:28,416
Lex talionis.

801
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:31,920
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

802
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:43,723
The retainer paid by Choi Cheol-min

803
01:00:43,807 --> 01:00:45,976
was deposited
into In-yeong's trust account.

804
01:00:46,685 --> 01:00:47,894
How have you been?

805
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:52,107
Choi sought medical help
for PTSD and anxiety disorders.

806
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:53,150
PHYSICIAN'S STATEMENT

807
01:00:53,233 --> 01:00:55,902
And in the meantime,
Mr. Yoon Seok-hoon kept his promise

808
01:00:55,986 --> 01:00:59,614
to Hwang Tae-seong and recovered
the money Choi Cheol-min had embezzled.

809
01:01:00,157 --> 01:01:04,202
As a result,
other investors filed lawsuits too,

810
01:01:04,286 --> 01:01:05,662
and Choi Cheol-min went bankrupt.

811
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:08,915
After that, Choi Cheol-min

812
01:01:08,999 --> 01:01:11,877
was imprisoned for fraud and embezzlement.

813
01:01:16,006 --> 01:01:16,923
Custody was granted

814
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:20,051
to In-yeong's mother,
who chose to divorce Choi Cheol-min

815
01:01:20,135 --> 01:01:22,137
after suffering from his domestic abuse.

816
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,896
Thinking that blood is thicker than water,

817
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:34,774
people sometimes turn
a blind eye and a deaf ear to the crimes

818
01:01:34,858 --> 01:01:36,568
committed by those bound by blood.

819
01:01:37,903 --> 01:01:39,654
Sometimes, the love of a stranger

820
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:41,907
can be deeper and stronger

821
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:44,618
than that of family.

822
01:02:03,303 --> 01:02:05,555
-Hello.
-Hello.

823
01:02:16,316 --> 01:02:17,484
Mr. Lee!

824
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:18,568
Well, someone's excited.

825
01:02:18,652 --> 01:02:20,070
Are you thrilled to see me?

826
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:21,529
Were you bored here alone?

827
01:02:21,613 --> 01:02:22,989
How was the weather in Pohang?

828
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:25,116
I wouldn't know.

829
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:26,534
I was working the entire time.

830
01:02:26,618 --> 01:02:27,911
Have things been okay?

831
01:02:27,994 --> 01:02:29,329
Things…

832
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:31,164
have been okay.

833
01:02:31,957 --> 01:02:33,333
Good morning.

834
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:34,626
You again?

835
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:36,753
Mr. Ji.

836
01:02:36,836 --> 01:02:37,712
Gguk!

837
01:02:39,381 --> 01:02:41,132
What's this sudden smile?

838
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:44,219
It's nice to see you again,

839
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:46,054
my law school classmate, Ji Guk-hyeon.

840
01:02:46,137 --> 01:02:47,555
You're creeping me out.

841
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:48,640
What's gotten into you?

842
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:52,352
-Hi, Ms. Kang.
-Hello, Ms. Choi.

843
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:53,770
Hi, Mr. Oh.

844
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:55,438
-Hi.
-Have you been well?

845
01:02:55,522 --> 01:02:56,690
You must be tired.

846
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,734
We should go on business trips more often.

847
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:01,778
-Why?
-Look how Ms. Kang welcomes us.

848
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:03,822
I'm moved.

849
01:03:03,905 --> 01:03:05,615
-Shall we get to work?
-Sure.

850
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,327
Mr. Yoon is here.

851
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:47,115
We should reinforce this section
on the failure to install safety devices…

852
01:03:52,162 --> 01:03:53,038
You're flushed.

853
01:03:58,418 --> 01:04:00,420
Did the rain yesterday give you a cold?

854
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:01,671
No.

855
01:04:02,339 --> 01:04:03,340
Excuse me.

856
01:04:18,563 --> 01:04:20,106
Have I caught a cold?

857
01:04:27,322 --> 01:04:28,323
Or maybe not.

858
01:04:39,751 --> 01:04:41,169
Yes, this is Yoon Seok-hoon.

859
01:04:44,923 --> 01:04:45,840
Yes.

860
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:53,264
Mr. Yoon.

861
01:04:53,348 --> 01:04:54,391
Later!

862
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:00,021
He's busy.

863
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:09,823
-I'm here for Hash.
-You can go in.

864
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:13,660
What happened?

865
01:05:14,327 --> 01:05:15,537
It's just an upset stomach.

866
01:05:16,454 --> 01:05:18,164
What the hell did you feed him?

867
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:23,962
He got an injection earlier.
He'll be okay.

868
01:05:25,505 --> 01:05:26,798
Hash!

869
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:28,466
Hey. Stop being a drama queen.

870
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:31,052
"Drama queen"?

871
01:05:31,136 --> 01:05:32,512
What did you just say?

872
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:33,555
You heard me.

873
01:05:33,638 --> 01:05:35,181
Can you keep it down?

874
01:05:35,265 --> 01:05:36,933
Hash is still…

875
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:39,936
Outside. Now.

876
01:05:43,898 --> 01:05:44,816
Bye.

877
01:05:46,276 --> 01:05:47,610
What?

878
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:52,740
What's your problem? Get it together.

879
01:05:52,824 --> 01:05:53,783
You get it together.

880
01:05:53,867 --> 01:05:55,076
I'm watching you.

881
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:56,286
I'm watching you too.

882
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:57,579
Stop copying me.

883
01:05:57,662 --> 01:05:59,164
I didn't copy you.

884
01:05:59,247 --> 01:06:00,123
You childish bastard.

885
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:01,583
You childish bastard.

886
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:02,625
-Seriously.
-Seriously.

887
01:06:02,709 --> 01:06:04,544
-Seriously.
-What?

888
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:06,629
Are you going to hit me again? Go on!

889
01:06:06,713 --> 01:06:10,008
Don't you even feel bad for me?

890
01:06:10,091 --> 01:06:11,259
Feel bad about what?

891
01:06:11,342 --> 01:06:13,052
I'm thankful that you let Yeon-a go.

892
01:06:13,136 --> 01:06:14,095
You little…

893
01:06:14,179 --> 01:06:16,764
Our relationship began
after yours ended properly.

894
01:06:16,848 --> 01:06:18,016
Why should I feel bad?

895
01:06:18,099 --> 01:06:19,767
You were always waiting for a chance.

896
01:06:19,851 --> 01:06:21,311
Cut the crap, will you?

897
01:06:21,394 --> 01:06:23,229
You know it happened
long after you two split,

898
01:06:23,313 --> 01:06:25,273
two years later, totally by chance.

899
01:06:25,356 --> 01:06:27,400
Still, who marries
their high school friend's ex-wife?

900
01:06:27,484 --> 01:06:28,568
Get the facts straight.

901
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:31,946
Yeon-a and I had been friends
long before I knew you.

902
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:34,282
Strictly speaking,
I'm Yeon-a's friend, not yours.

903
01:06:34,365 --> 01:06:35,825
You and I were closer!

904
01:06:35,909 --> 01:06:36,951
Does it matter?

905
01:06:38,703 --> 01:06:39,829
Jung Won-jun!

906
01:06:41,331 --> 01:06:42,707
That's enough.

907
01:06:43,249 --> 01:06:45,293
It's just that Seok-hoon kept…

908
01:08:05,331 --> 01:08:08,501
BEYOND THE BAR

909
01:08:08,585 --> 01:08:09,752
Ms. Kang.

910
01:08:09,836 --> 01:08:12,755
You should've consulted a senior attorney
before taking on a new case.

911
01:08:12,839 --> 01:08:14,632
You only have a week to prepare.

912
01:08:14,716 --> 01:08:16,759
There's not much I can do for you now.

913
01:08:16,843 --> 01:08:19,554
But you'll prepare the defense
on your own and own the outcome.

914
01:08:20,221 --> 01:08:21,889
-Wake up.
-What an amusing turn.

915
01:08:21,973 --> 01:08:23,558
-And saw a colorful parade--
-Your Honor.

916
01:08:23,641 --> 01:08:25,893
Objection. Leading the witness.

917
01:08:25,977 --> 01:08:28,938
What's the point in asking?
What would a copycat know anyway?

918
01:08:29,022 --> 01:08:31,399
You idiot.

919
01:08:31,482 --> 01:08:33,276
No more screw-ups!

920
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:34,652
Mr. Yoon!

921
01:08:35,236 --> 01:08:36,321
Please help me.

922
