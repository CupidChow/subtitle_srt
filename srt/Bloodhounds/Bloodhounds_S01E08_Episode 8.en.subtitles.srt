1
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,270
Damn it.

2
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:21,521
CHOI TAE-HO

3
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:38,163
MR. OH, HWANG YANG-JUNG
LEE DU-YEONG, HYEON-JU

4
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:47,714
Aren't you going home?

5
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:50,050
I was looking for a house, sir.

6
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:53,678
Jeez. It's not easy
finding a home nowadays.

7
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:55,805
What about your honeymoon?

8
00:00:56,389 --> 00:01:00,060
My wife wants to go to Paris,
but I don't think we can go due to COVID.

9
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,936
Jeez. That damn COVID.

10
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,859
What brings you here at this hour?

11
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:12,530
Hey.

12
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:14,783
There's a big case.

13
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:18,453
I've been watching
a loan shark for about six months,

14
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:22,373
and this bastard takes videos
of people to threaten them with.

15
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:27,504
I got my hands on
a list of the bastard's victims today.

16
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:32,050
I'll share the data with you.
Let's dive into it together.

17
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:34,844
Yes, sir.

18
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:37,931
-Get back to it.
-Yes, sir.

19
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:43,978
Yes.

20
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:46,272
He said he received the list today.

21
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,775
He probably didn't do it alone.

22
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,071
Find out who took part in it,
and I'll pay you 100 million per person.

23
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:54,948
Yes, sir.

24
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,659
When will you get Oh In-muk's location?

25
00:01:57,742 --> 00:02:02,038
I should be able to get the locations
of where he used his credit card

26
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:05,208
in the last seven days
by tomorrow morning.

27
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:08,837
I'll wire you the money
once I receive it. Good luck.

28
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,093
A hundred million.

29
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:18,638
How's it going?

30
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:23,560
Only Jang-do knew
the location of the hard drive.

31
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:26,563
The punk blurted it out
when President Choi nabbed him.

32
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:32,861
The bastards who were with him back then
fucking teamed up with Director Hong.

33
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:34,320
Myeong-gil.

34
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,240
Is there only one hard drive?

35
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,203
There's only one hard drive.

36
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:47,584
But everything's backed up
on a laptop we used

37
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,128
to transfer the videos to the hard drive.

38
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:53,590
I see.

39
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,218
For now, we should just stay put.

40
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,847
If we release that video
at the wrong time,

41
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,433
Director Hong, that son of a bitch,

42
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:07,812
is going to hit our company
with a tax audit.

43
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:11,733
Myeong-gil,

44
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:16,237
isn't it better to let them know
that you still have the video?

45
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,783
Scare them so they don't mess around.

46
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:28,499
You're smart, aren't you?

47
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:30,543
Shall we toast?

48
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,253
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

49
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:39,052
ADDRESS, MART
GAS STATION, RICE STORE

50
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,696
GOHEUNG GROCERIES

51
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,740
Have you seen him?

52
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:05,286
I'm not sure. Customers wear masks,
so I'm not so sure.

53
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:07,664
I see. Is that so?

54
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,874
Fuck, seriously.

55
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:11,793
Take another look.

56
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:18,341
I don't know.

57
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,676
Think this is funny?

58
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:22,345
-Excuse me?
-You think this is fucking funny?

59
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,222
No, that's not it.

60
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,849
Goddammit.

61
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,018
Eyes down, you shithead.

62
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,771
Take a close look. Do you know him?

63
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:32,689
I don't know--

64
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:36,776
Do you know or not, you fucker?
Get up. Do you know him or not?

65
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:37,819
-I don't know.
-No?

66
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:40,697
Motherfucker, take a better look.
Do you or not?

67
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:42,198
Motherfucker.

68
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,908
-Fuck.
-I should kill you, you fuck.

69
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:45,493
Look at it closely.

70
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:46,661
Hello, sir.

71
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:47,829
Hello, welcome.

72
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:49,497
-Can I ask you something?
-Sure.

73
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:53,251
I'm looking for someone,
a friend of my dad's.

74
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,629
Yes, I know this person.

75
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,589
-You do?
-I do, but what's this about?

76
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:01,926
I'm getting married, so I wanted
to give him a wedding invitation.

77
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,011
I see.

78
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,220
Do you know his address?

79
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,640
Of course.
I deliver rice there every month.

80
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,685
Could I get an address?

81
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,395
Sure. I'll tell you.

82
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,812
BLOODHOUNDS

83
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:01,819
He's here.

84
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,450
Kang In-beom's profile.

85
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,620
I got everything
there is to know about him.

86
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,623
You work fast.

87
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,376
Speed is of the essence in these matters.

88
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,668
-Thank you.
-All right.

89
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,171
-It's done.
-Yes.

90
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:39,148
This is it?

91
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,108
Excuse me?

92
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,027
So you don't know.

93
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:47,407
Normally, when you make
someone do something like this,

94
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,034
you offer a token of thanks.

95
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,370
Right. How much should we give you?

96
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,705
All right, a lot.

97
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:59,585
I mean, we're a team
and family now. A big tip will do.

98
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,838
-Okay, here.
-Yes.

99
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,214
Thank you.

100
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,300
Call me whenever.

101
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,344
-Will do. Have a nice day.
-Goodbye, then.

102
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,262
All right.

103
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:17,270
TEN THOUSAND WON

104
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:21,983
Fuck, I meant a million won.

105
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,488
PERSONAL INFORMATION
KANG IN-BEOM

106
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,080
She told us not to use it.

107
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,168
But we should look
at his neighborhood on a big screen.

108
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:42,003
What if Da-min comes in?

109
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:46,215
She won't. She happened to be passing by
the last time we got caught.

110
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,550
A stroke of bad luck.

111
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:49,635
Hey.

112
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,597
-"Gangdong-gu, Seonggu-ro."
-"Seonggu-ro."

113
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,937
I told you she'd come. Turn it off.

114
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:08,237
What's wrong?

115
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,824
It smells like lonely men in here.

116
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,285
Why did you use it again?

117
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:15,745
Go to an Internet café.

118
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:17,288
We're sorry.

119
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,582
Also, sorry about the lonely smell.

120
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:20,917
Damn it.

121
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,336
Whatever. This room is ruined.

122
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:24,253
It's ruined.

123
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,213
Da-min!

124
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,966
-What?
-I'm sorry about today.

125
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,635
I'll take care of this smell.

126
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,345
How?

127
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:33,346
A diffuser.

128
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:37,642
A diffuser will get rid
of this sad old man smell.

129
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:38,559
Really?

130
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:42,522
First, to get rid of an odor,
one needs to find an opposing scent.

131
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:45,691
This sad old-man smell is
a blend of a thick, musky scent

132
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,777
with an unintended scent of rotten wood.

133
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,779
To get rid of it,
we need an opposing scent.

134
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,908
Something floral and fruity.

135
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:55,910
I use Baies from Diptyque.

136
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:57,828
-I like that one.
-That's good.

137
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,539
Hey, that's really good!

138
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:02,416
The fresh sweetness in the Baies
will cancel out

139
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,419
all the sad old man smell here.

140
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:08,548
We'll get you one
when we leave this place.

141
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:10,591
-A gift.
-Yes.

142
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,635
We'll get you one
for upstairs and downstairs.

143
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:13,761
For the bathroom too.

144
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:15,304
Okay, three it is.

145
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,264
Deal.

146
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,776
How does Kang In-beom know my number?
Look at this.

147
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,112
No way.

148
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:32,738
Something must be wrong, right?

149
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,001
What's wrong with Grandpa?

150
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,211
Who did this to him?

151
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:48,546
Well…

152
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,134
Hey…

153
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,345
Come to Four Garden shopping mall
in Incheon in an hour.

154
00:09:56,929 --> 00:10:00,182
Call the cops, and the old man dies.

155
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,767
I'm going to fucking kill you.

156
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,312
Hey…

157
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,856
Da-min, you should tell us what he said.

158
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,816
He said to come to Four Garden mall
in an hour.

159
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,234
If we call the cops…

160
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:13,487
he said he'll kill Grandpa.

161
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:17,908
Hurry. There's no time.

162
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,425
-Gun-woo.
-Yes?

163
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:37,178
-How many do you think will be there?
-At least 30?

164
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:39,055
They'll probably have weapons.

165
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:41,974
Kang In-beom and that Mr. Jung guy
will be there too.

166
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,185
Should we call Gang-yong?

167
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:48,773
No, that would put Mr. Oh
in too much danger.

168
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,275
What about our senior?

169
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,318
Which senior?

170
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:53,235
Mr. Moon.

171
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:55,571
But he hurt his arm.

172
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,615
Wouldn't he help in any way he could?

173
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,950
Well, that's true, but…

174
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:01,952
Are you all set?

175
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:05,373
Yes, but Da-min, what's the bow for?

176
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,041
For rescuing Grandpa.

177
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:10,961
Absolutely not. It's too dangerous.
We'll go, just the two of us.

178
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:13,798
Step aside.

179
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:16,884
No, Da-min--

180
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,344
-What are you--
-Wait.

181
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:27,978
I can help in my own way.

182
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,648
I'm going, period. So don't stop me.

183
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:33,734
Come on. We don't have time.

184
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:36,821
Hey, she's a good shot.

185
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:37,738
Hey,

186
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,865
I think she'll be useful.

187
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,746
Sir, it's Woo-jin.

188
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:47,998
Mr. Oh

189
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,751
has been kidnapped.

190
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:54,255
Can you help us in any way?

191
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:56,841
I'm also indebted to Mr. Oh.

192
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:59,760
Don't go in without me, no matter what.

193
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,220
That's an order.

194
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:51,312
MOON GWANG-MU
734TH CLASS SENIOR

195
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,202
Junior Marines, you're here?

196
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,788
-Yes, sir.
-Sir, you've really gone all out.

197
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:12,666
I put some on because I had it
lying around at home. It itches.

198
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,168
I think it's old.

199
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:16,170
Get out before my skin
starts breaking out.

200
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,267
I'll go through the parking lot…

201
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:31,644
Who are you?

202
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,646
I'm here to rescue my grandpa.

203
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,774
She's Mr. Oh's granddaughter.

204
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,276
I see. Right.

205
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,070
You have similar facial structures.

206
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:42,780
It's been an hour.

207
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,699
Okay, but what's that bag?

208
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,076
It's a compound bow.

209
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:48,786
A guobaorou?

210
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:50,704
A compound bow.

211
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:51,664
Guo--

212
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,958
Sir, it's a bow for archers.

213
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:58,003
Right. Koreans are good at archery.

214
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,631
Is she good?

215
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:01,841
She is.

216
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:06,220
Okay. Archer and I will take
the stairs from the parking lot

217
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:08,138
and go to the top of the building.

218
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:11,058
Marines, you'll charge in
through the front gates.

219
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:13,435
We'll cover fire from the top. Understood?

220
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,937
-Yes, sir.
-Let's move.

221
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:17,940
-Follow me.
-Okay.

222
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,489
-This way.
-Right, okay.

223
00:14:58,606 --> 00:14:59,857
Where is Mr. Oh?

224
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,776
Fucking kill them!

225
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:04,904
Fuck!

226
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,834
One, two, three!

227
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:25,841
Damn it.

228
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:48,822
-What?
-Where is it?

229
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:49,823
Where is it?

230
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,701
Whoa, Archer.

231
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:53,911
-Get them!
-Who is it?

232
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:54,828
Up there!

233
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,413
-Nice.
-Where?

234
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,040
What? What is it?

235
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,254
Hey, stop!

236
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,506
Up there!

237
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:07,091
The one in black, over there.

238
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:08,509
Who is it? Who's doing this?

239
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,311
The blue one, over there.

240
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:24,775
Damn it.

241
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:27,653
Keep helping the juniors, okay?

242
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:36,453
Hey, blue boy.

243
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,498
Were you on the track team?

244
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,250
Fuck.

245
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,232
Get lost!

246
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,694
Hey, he's coming! Make room!

247
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:11,864
Get him!

248
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,836
Damn it.

249
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,554
What are you doing? Get up.

250
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,036
Shit!

251
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:17,971
Damn it.

252
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,310
Shit.

253
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:22,536
You ain't shit without that knife.

254
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:24,913
Pull it out, motherfucker.

255
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:26,957
Pull it out!

256
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,839
You've got pride, don't you?

257
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:36,550
Come on, then.

258
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,844
Mister, are you all right?

259
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:22,012
Not at all.

260
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,804
One, two, three, four!

261
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:06,640
One, two, three, four!

262
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,123
Hey, track guy!

263
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:36,086
Hey, asshole. We don't have time. Wake up!

264
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:38,630
Hey, where's Mr. Oh?

265
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:43,468
Look at this bastard,
giving his senior a scary stare-down.

266
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,721
-Archer, hand me an arrow.
-What?

267
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,056
It's fine. Give it to me for a second.

268
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:52,185
What a loyal bloodhound
we have here, this bastard.

269
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,146
I was like you, too,

270
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:56,440
when Mr. Choi was still in our midst.

271
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:01,945
Hey, do you know what becomes
of a bloodhound that's lost its master?

272
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:05,240
It becomes a stray
that just mauls anyone in sight!

273
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:13,749
No, you're fine.

274
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,752
You're just in shock. You're not in pain.

275
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,670
The real pain comes

276
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:20,714
when I pull this out!

277
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,803
Juniors,

278
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:29,389
please cover our archer's ears.

279
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,313
You're not married, right?

280
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,023
Well,

281
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:42,652
the most important thing
in the world is family.

282
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:46,990
But without this,
you'll never be able to make one.

283
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:52,496
Work or family. Pick one.

284
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:56,166
If you still choose work,
even in this situation,

285
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:57,959
I'll admit that you're a true pro.

286
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:01,630
But in exchange,
I'm going to puncture your balls.

287
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,048
Why?

288
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,050
Because I'm also a pro.

289
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:07,219
So, what'll it be?

290
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,013
I'll give you three seconds.

291
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,223
Three,

292
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:12,265
two,

293
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,018
one.

294
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:19,189
-Wait!
-What? Why?

295
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,734
I'll talk, sir.

296
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,323
Tuck in the head.

297
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:30,867
Get inside, hurry!

298
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:33,537
I said tuck in that head.

299
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:43,130
Sir, we'll go and save Mr. Oh.
Can you hold on to Kang In-beom?

300
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:45,215
What are you saying? I should come too.

301
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:46,800
We'll do it ourselves.

302
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,594
Sir, your arm's in bad shape.

303
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:52,055
Fuck, seriously.

304
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:56,268
Sir, Kang In-beom knows
where Kim Myeong-gil's slush funds are,

305
00:23:56,351 --> 00:24:00,230
the location of the safe with the funds,
and where he hid Mr. Choi's gold.

306
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:03,442
Please get all that information from him
using your Marine spirit.

307
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:04,609
Please, sir.

308
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,863
All right, I'll do that.

309
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:10,866
Save Mr. Oh, no matter what.

310
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,367
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

311
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:14,494
Let's go. Da-min, get in.

312
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,880
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

313
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:30,760
Here.

314
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:34,139
How does it look?

315
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:38,727
Sir, I've seen him standing next to
the Blue House Chief of Staff before.

316
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,480
-The chief of staff?
-Yes, sir.

317
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:43,857
That hooked nose and ears. I'm positive.

318
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,736
Why would a loan shark bribe
the presidential office?

319
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:48,778
Just being nosy?

320
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:51,907
Or he could be
a bigger player than we realize.

321
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,953
HEAVY DRINKER GUN-WOO

322
00:24:58,288 --> 00:24:59,122
Hey.

323
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:01,333
Hello, I'm sorry for calling so late,

324
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:03,960
but we didn't know
what to do, so I called.

325
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:06,713
-What is it?
-Kim Myeong-gil kidnapped Mr. Oh.

326
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:09,257
So I'm heading
to Seoryeong with Woo-jin right now.

327
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,509
Just the two of you?

328
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,385
Why are you telling me this now?

329
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:16,556
I'm sorry, but they said
they'd kill Mr. Oh if we told the cops.

330
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,641
Hold on.

331
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:20,352
Did Kim Myeong-gil call you in person?

332
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:23,605
No, we captured one of his cronies,
and he told us.

333
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:26,066
So, you don't know for certain
whether Kim is there?

334
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:26,983
That's right.

335
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:32,322
Send me the location. I'll head over.
So don't go in, and wait for me.

336
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:33,281
Okay.

337
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:36,451
-Woo-jin, text him.
-Okay.

338
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,499
-Yes, sir.
-Hey, Jae-min.

339
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:44,376
Come to the meeting room now.

340
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:46,002
Yes, sir.

341
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:57,597
Jae-min, call in some backup.
It's Buseong-myeon, in Seoryeong.

342
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,724
It's about the case I mentioned last time.

343
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,642
Yes, sir.

344
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:01,560
Okay.

345
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:02,852
When did you see them?

346
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,438
About a month ago.

347
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:07,857
LIEUTENANT KIM JAE-MIN

348
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,194
Yes.

349
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,749
MR. KIM MYEONG-GIL

350
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,378
The cops are on their way.

351
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:29,838
Understood.

352
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:40,724
Hey, the cops are coming!
Start cleaning up!

353
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:06,166
All right.
Check if there's a back entrance.

354
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:08,126
Move out. Hurry up.

355
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:20,472
Turn off the engine.

356
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:21,389
Right.

357
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:24,392
Da-min, we'll see what the situation is.
Wait here.

358
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:30,065
We arrived before you and searched.
There's nothing. It's a flatfish farm.

359
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:31,149
Well…

360
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,612
Please talk to the bastard in the trunk.

361
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,367
Who's this bastard?

362
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:42,202
Kim Myeong-gil's goon.

363
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:44,037
The one who stabbed me.

364
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,335
I'm a cop, so answer me honestly.

365
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:53,713
Nod your head, you prick.

366
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:56,675
Is it Seoul Fish Farm?

367
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,679
Did anyone know we were coming?

368
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:05,975
Gang-yong.

369
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:09,062
This guy's cronies ran off mid-fight.

370
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:11,564
They might've given them a heads-up.

371
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:18,947
Leave this guy here,
and you guys get out of here.

372
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,323
You guys weren't here, okay?

373
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:21,324
-Okay.
-Okay.

374
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:22,992
-You aren't hurt, right?
-No.

375
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:24,828
Han-gu.

376
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:36,673
Where is Grandpa?

377
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:40,844
Let's wait.
The detectives will get back to us.

378
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:43,430
We don't have time.

379
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,601
We have to find him.

380
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,688
We will, no matter what.

381
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:54,983
You bastard, the safe!

382
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,944
Where is Kim Myeong-gil's safe?

383
00:28:58,027 --> 00:28:59,154
Damn it, seriously!

384
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:02,907
Hey, asshole, you're really going to die
if you keep this up!

385
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:18,590
Give me a cigarette.

386
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:21,551
You bastard!

387
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:28,183
-Hit me!
-You're dead.

388
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:30,435
Hit me harder!

389
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:37,066
BEST PORK
BEOMSEUNG DISTRIBUTION

390
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:47,744
How'd it go?

391
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:49,704
What about Mr. Oh?

392
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,039
We couldn't find him.

393
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,208
I think those bastards
took him somewhere else.

394
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,667
Damn it.

395
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:55,794
Did he say anything?

396
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:59,088
That's one stubborn bastard.
He won't talk.

397
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,596
Having fun, aren't you?

398
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:11,267
-Want to see something more fun?
-What the hell is this fucker saying?

399
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:24,572
Damn it.

400
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:27,575
Sir! That bastard bit his tongue!

401
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:28,868
Fuck!

402
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:29,828
Come on, sir!

403
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,331
Damn it! Fuck!

404
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,542
-Hey!
-Fuck.

405
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:37,752
-Kang In-beom, snap out of it!
-Fuck!

406
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,755
-Woo-jin, call an ambulance!
-Okay.

407
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,340
Wait!

408
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:45,593
If we send him off,
how will we find Kim Myeong-gil's safe?

409
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:48,847
Still, we can't let a person die, sir.

410
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:51,474
If he dies, we won't get to the safe.

411
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:54,561
Damn it! Give it to me.

412
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:56,980
Help me get him down, please.

413
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:05,405
Sir, are you all right?

414
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:08,032
Sir, wake up! Are you okay?

415
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:15,874
Hello.

416
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:16,916
Hello.

417
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:18,877
Where's the owner?

418
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:20,670
On vacation.

419
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:21,963
I see.

420
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,966
I'd like an iced coffee
with Ethiopian beans.

421
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:25,884
All right.

422
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,929
-Here. Please wait.
-Okay, thank you.

423
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:32,891
MY HAPPY FAMILY, I'LL KEEP YOU SAFE

424
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:51,451
CEO KIM MYEONG-GIL
ATTACHED FILE: 1 VIDEO FILE

425
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,458
Damn it!

426
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:05,256
Hey, Min-beom.

427
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:09,052
Kim Myeong-gil still has the video of me.

428
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:11,054
He just sent it to me.

429
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:12,889
What?

430
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:16,976
Hello?

431
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,227
Gang-yong?

432
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:19,854
Hello?

433
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:27,487
Damn it!

434
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:34,702
Fuck.

435
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,158
Motherfuckers.

436
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:16,452
You motherfucker.

437
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:21,499
Sa…

438
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:22,583
What?

439
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,085
Salt!

440
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:49,861
Someone's been hit!

441
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:51,237
-She must be dead.
-Go check.

442
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,613
What happened?

443
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,699
-Call 911.
-I think someone died.

444
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:59,245
MR. OH

445
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:04,375
Gun-woo, come here. Hurry.

446
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:14,469
Hey, you dumbass punks.

447
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,305
Why are you causing a big problem?

448
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:19,807
What do you want?

449
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,520
Come to the fish farm at 9:00 p.m. today.

450
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:29,984
If you call the cops again, I'm going to
grind Oh In-muk up and feed the fish.

451
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:31,903
Answer me.

452
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:36,949
I've gotten rid of Min Gang-yong
and his cronies, so don't mess with me.

453
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,452
I said I'd kill your mom

454
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:41,662
if you showed up again.

455
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:44,082
See you there.

456
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:48,878
GANG-YONG

457
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,928
They got to Gang-yong? But he's a cop.

458
00:34:57,804 --> 00:34:59,597
It'll be really dangerous this time.

459
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,140
We should go by ourselves.

460
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:02,767
Excuse me.

461
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:06,604
How long have you been there?

462
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:08,272
From the start.

463
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:11,150
Don't you dare leave me out.

464
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,568
I'm going to rescue Grandpa.

465
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:19,534
Come with me.

466
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:34,006
If something bad happens
to Mr. Oh in front of us,

467
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:37,844
Da-min's definitely going to
break down like Hyeon-ju.

468
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:41,848
Woo-jin, I never want to see that again.

469
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:43,474
But Gun-woo,

470
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,602
one thing's different from back then.

471
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:48,271
You know what that is?

472
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:50,231
Back then,

473
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:53,693
the invincible Marine duo was separated.

474
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:59,031
That's not the case now. And we're
a lot stronger, okay? Do you remember?

475
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,868
One, two, three, four, five.

476
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:03,786
One, two, three, four, five!

477
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:05,997
Yes.

478
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:08,624
So,

479
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:12,587
let's work together and save everyone.

480
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:15,131
Mr. Oh, Da-min,

481
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,426
and all the people that Kim hurt.

482
00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:42,158
Why are we stopping?

483
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:45,661
Woo-jin and I will head in first.
You keep a lookout.

484
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,538
Come in once you find a spot to shoot.

485
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:48,539
Sounds good.

486
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:49,874
Get out.

487
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:16,442
Damn it. They dropped me off so far away.

488
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,322
Good thinking.

489
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:22,240
What?

490
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:26,035
You dropped her off far away
so she doesn't get hurt, right?

491
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:29,914
Well, I did that so we don't get caught.

492
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:32,708
Was it a bit far?

493
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:36,337
It'll take her ten minutes.

494
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,214
Let's finish this fast, just us.

495
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:39,632
Sounds good.

496
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:48,868
Kill them!

497
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:55,624
These bastards have a crap ton of weapons.

498
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,425
Woo-jin!

499
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:26,947
You son of a bitch!

500
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:28,783
Fuck!

501
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:38,125
Let go, damn it!

502
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:42,505
Let go!

503
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:46,300
Fuck!

504
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,764
Son of a bitch!

505
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,183
Hey, you fucker!

506
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,560
What the hell?

507
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:17,540
Son of a bitch!

508
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:22,378
Hey, you son of a bitch!

509
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:23,838
Fuck!

510
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:29,093
Hey.

511
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:32,179
You can't even get rid of two kids?

512
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,307
I'm sorry, sir.

513
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:38,227
You're always fucking apologizing.

514
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:42,565
Now then.

515
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:45,651
Stop!

516
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:47,903
Hey!

517
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,656
You punks so much as move a muscle,

518
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:53,367
and I'll slit his throat,
so do what you will!

519
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,287
That's right. Stop moving.

520
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:07,756
What are you doing, you stupid fucks?
Hurry up and kill them.

521
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:09,842
Should I kill them?

522
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:12,678
You sons of bitches are unbelievable.

523
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,101
Duck!

524
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:23,522
-What's that?
-What happened?

525
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:31,322
You asshole! Come here!

526
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:34,116
I said, kill them already!
You sons of bitches!

527
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,993
What are you doing? Let go, you prick!

528
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:45,544
-Let me go!
-Let's go to the hospital.

529
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,882
Kill them! Come on!

530
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:17,618
Grandpa! Are you all right?

531
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:19,578
It's me, Da-min.

532
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:29,171
You plucked my eyebrows.

533
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,259
Mr. Oh, are you all right?

534
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:36,929
Thank you.

535
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:50,568
What's this?

536
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:52,069
Move faster.

537
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:54,071
Hurry up and get to work!

538
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:02,371
Who is it?

539
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:04,164
Chinese delivery.

540
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:15,050
What the hell, you bastards!

541
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:17,845
Stay still, you fucking bastard!

542
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:23,017
Search the entire area!

543
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,852
-Scour every inch!
-What is this place?

544
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:29,690
I found it! Everyone over here!

545
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:34,236
-Those bastards…
-What were they doing here?

546
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:41,243
I'm Yang Yun-seo
from Major Crimes Investigation Division.

547
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:43,662
Here's a search warrant.

548
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:46,540
We'll now be conducting
a search and seizure on your property.

549
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,584
We appreciate your cooperation. Come in.

550
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:50,544
Hurry up inside.

551
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:56,675
Mr. Kim Jae-min?

552
00:43:57,176 --> 00:44:00,471
You're under arrest
for murder, bribery, and other charges.

553
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:03,932
Fuck. What a shitty day.

554
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,434
Let's go.

555
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:08,187
-Sir.
-Yes.

556
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:22,034
The warrant was issued quickly,
so we went into Kim's house.

557
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:24,328
Several phones were found
in his closet drawer.

558
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:28,832
We traced the numbers. They all belonged
to dead or missing individuals.

559
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:30,042
Jeez.

560
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:34,421
This crazy bastard kept the phones
of the people he killed.

561
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:36,548
He can't get out of this one.

562
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:38,676
Not even the US president could save him.

563
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:40,052
What about fleeing overseas?

564
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:42,930
He's a wanted man now,
so it won't be easy.

565
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:46,141
People often flee to China on cargo ships.

566
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:48,394
Kim is a grade-A wanted criminal.

567
00:44:48,977 --> 00:44:51,397
We'll focus surveillance
on potential stowaway routes.

568
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,564
He won't escape Korea.

569
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:54,525
But it's not completely impossible.

570
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:59,530
You all seem to think this is all over,
but I'm really on edge right now.

571
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:01,573
That bastard still has that video of me.

572
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:03,909
If he loses it and releases it,
it's over for me.

573
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:10,249
Gang-yong.

574
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:13,585
I have to see that bastard behind bars.

575
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:15,754
Min-beom.

576
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:19,717
I understand.

577
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:25,013
But look at Han-gu's condition right now.

578
00:45:26,181 --> 00:45:27,808
And Tae-yeong isn't conscious yet.

579
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:30,102
We'll need some time.

580
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:39,403
We'll help you.

581
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:42,656
It's not over until it's over.

582
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:47,286
Can you find us Im Jang-do's whereabouts?

583
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:48,871
Why Im Jang-do?

584
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:52,958
Im Jang-do's probably hiding somewhere,
trying to stay away from Kim Myeong-gil.

585
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:57,963
But I think Im Jang-do may know
where Kim Myeong-gil might run off to.

586
00:45:58,046 --> 00:46:01,383
Right, Im Jang-do may have given him tips
on how to smuggle out.

587
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:03,886
He mentioned
he was in charge of stuff like that.

588
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:06,638
Okay, I'll look into it.

589
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:15,522
How much is it in cash?

590
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:17,608
I can bring it down to 18 million.

591
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:24,406
Im Jang-do hasn't used a phone or card
under his name in the last six months.

592
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:27,075
He avoided everything that was traceable.

593
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:28,786
Is there any other way?

594
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:34,082
Well, all we've managed to find
for now is his bank account number.

595
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:37,920
And the last transaction was
a cash withdrawal in March in Suwon.

596
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:39,505
Isn't that enough to find him?

597
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:43,050
There are a few months' worth of footage,
so we'd need a man on it full-time.

598
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:45,219
It would take some time.

599
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:49,765
Could we get his account number?

600
00:46:49,848 --> 00:46:52,226
This prick is probably strapped
for cash right now.

601
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:54,061
Now wire money into that account.

602
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:57,481
When you send it, put down
your phone number under the sender's name.

603
00:46:57,564 --> 00:46:59,274
Then he'll contact you. Guaranteed.

604
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:01,819
-How much should I send?
-A large amount should do.

605
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:03,278
Ten thousand won?

606
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:06,949
I wondered
if I should've mentioned this last time,

607
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:09,827
but in this line of work,
the meaning of "large amount" varies.

608
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:12,538
That large amount from when I got you
Kang's personal details

609
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:14,748
was supposed to be a million,
not ten thousand.

610
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:15,999
A million won?

611
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:19,169
Of course, I don't mean
to ask for that money now.

612
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:20,629
I'm not some cheapskate.

613
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:21,964
We're family, after all.

614
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:24,591
In our situation,
how much are we talking about?

615
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:26,468
He's going to scoff at a million won.

616
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:27,845
Ten million won.

617
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:30,889
He'll bite right away.

618
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:43,735
Your wounds aren't healing
because you keep drinking alcohol--

619
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:45,195
Fuck!

620
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:57,583
-Doctor.
-Yes, sir.

621
00:47:58,166 --> 00:47:59,209
Just do your job.

622
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:00,586
Yes, sir.

623
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:07,009
Fuck.

624
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:08,260
Sixty-six,

625
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:10,095
sixty-seven,

626
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:12,347
sixty-eight, sixty-nine.

627
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:13,724
Woo-jin.

628
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:15,976
There's no number.

629
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:23,275
Hello?

630
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:28,947
Hello?

631
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:33,201
Hello?

632
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:38,540
You're the kid
that was with President Choi, right?

633
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:43,003
I am.

634
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:45,881
And the cops told you my account number.

635
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:50,636
What is it? Why did you send the money?

636
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:53,388
Kim Myeong-gil is on the run.

637
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:55,057
Why's that?

638
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:59,853
Police raided Kim Myeong-gil's house
and found evidence that he killed people.

639
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:00,896
When was that?

640
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:02,230
Two days ago.

641
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:06,109
You know where he'll flee to, don't you?

642
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:09,655
I do.

643
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:11,490
Please.

644
00:49:11,573 --> 00:49:14,701
We want to catch Kim Myeong-gil. Help us.

645
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:19,247
How much will you pay?

646
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:23,335
A large amount.

647
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:26,421
Shit, you've got to be fucking kidding me.

648
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:30,175
-A billion!
-A billion?

649
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:32,844
I trusted President Choi
and got fucked over.

650
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:34,513
I deserve that much compensation.

651
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:36,390
But right now, we only have--

652
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:40,602
In four days, Kim Myeong-gil will flee
overseas using the method I taught him.

653
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:43,021
You know my account, right?

654
00:49:44,189 --> 00:49:45,357
Think it over.

655
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:50,112
This is ridiculous.

656
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:52,364
How will we get a billion?

657
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:55,534
Should we ask Mr. Oh?

658
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:57,160
Mr. Oh doesn't have money.

659
00:49:57,744 --> 00:50:00,080
The money he gave us
was the last of the funds.

660
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:01,707
Hold up.

661
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:08,755
How much is in there?

662
00:50:11,883 --> 00:50:13,385
I think around 300 million.

663
00:50:13,468 --> 00:50:14,761
It's nowhere enough.

664
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:19,975
Should we ask Min-beom?

665
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:22,811
Im Jang-do's the one
who took that video of Min-beom.

666
00:50:23,478 --> 00:50:25,981
You think he'll help us with this?

667
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:30,944
Still, Min-beom's the only one
with that kind of money.

668
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:33,947
Let's ask him just once, okay?

669
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:43,874
Sir, here they are.

670
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:51,048
Do you guys trust Im Jang-do?

671
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:54,468
Well,

672
00:50:55,635 --> 00:51:00,182
we do think we can trust
the information he has.

673
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:03,393
What if he takes the billion
and hightails it overseas?

674
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:05,312
Then what do we do?

675
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:29,044
If Im Jang-do breaks his promise and runs,

676
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:31,338
we'll chase him down until we catch him.

677
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:33,799
That much I can promise you.

678
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:50,190
You keep that promise.

679
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:53,443
-I will.
-Okay.

680
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:58,740
1,000,000,000 RECEIVED

681
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,839
Okay, I'm done checking. Move along.

682
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:14,756
Okay.

683
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:16,341
You may go.

684
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:11,938
UNKNOWN CALLER

685
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:16,359
Write this down.

686
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:20,697
The day after tomorrow, at 1:00 a.m.,
a ship named Nike will depart from Pohang

687
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:21,823
for Ho Chi Minh City.

688
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:24,743
Kim gave political funds
to a high-ranking Vietnamese official.

689
00:53:24,826 --> 00:53:27,621
He's going to take off
with all of his slush funds.

690
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:30,957
The container number is TJBU 9004230.

691
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:34,085
His funds will be hidden in a truck
inside the container.

692
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:36,546
Should we go for it
when he's getting on the ship?

693
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:38,548
It's a big ship,
so it won't be easy to find.

694
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:39,466
How do we find it?

695
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,843
Get on the ship with him!

696
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:46,514
You mean all the way to Vietnam?

697
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:48,141
Well, that's up to you.

698
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:50,435
-I'm hanging up now.
-Wait.

699
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:53,146
What should we do
if we want to board that ship?

700
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:57,442
I'll text you a contact. Tell him
I sent you, and try to work out a deal.

701
00:53:57,525 --> 00:53:59,736
FYI, he likes cash.

702
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:07,160
We got the text.

703
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:19,130
I didn't know what you'd need,
so I prepared a bit of everything.

704
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:21,424
Thank you, sir.

705
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:22,926
Take care of yourselves.

706
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:24,594
Yes, sir.

707
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:26,721
Okay?

708
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:28,807
Yes, sir.

709
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:32,185
Let's go up.

710
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:34,354
You go on ahead.

711
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:35,772
I need to talk.

712
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:39,859
All right.

713
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:47,409
Thank you for all your help.

714
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:49,911
We should be thanking you.

715
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:01,464
See you, Da-min.

716
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:04,175
See you.

717
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:05,093
Go ahead.

718
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:12,017
You know my number, right?

719
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:21,568
Let's go.

720
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:34,497
-Yes, Min-beom.
-Are you on your way?

721
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:36,458
We're on our way.

722
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:39,085
Don't get hurt, okay?

723
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:40,420
Okay.

724
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:42,756
Gang-yong and I
will take care of the rest.

725
00:55:43,631 --> 00:55:44,758
Drive safe.

726
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:45,675
Okay.

727
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:21,586
Let's hurry.

728
00:56:21,669 --> 00:56:22,796
Just a second.

729
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:24,381
Just a second.

730
00:56:37,018 --> 00:56:37,852
Woo-jin.

731
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:42,190
Okay.

732
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:56,621
Set sail.

733
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:08,925
Let's check the inside first.

734
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:53,136
Kim Myeong-gil!

735
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:14,657
Damn it.

736
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:26,503
Yes.

737
01:02:57,398 --> 01:02:58,941
If you ever show up again…

738
01:03:01,944 --> 01:03:03,237
I'll kill you.

739
01:03:48,449 --> 01:03:49,283
Gun-woo.

740
01:03:53,704 --> 01:03:54,789
Are you all right?

741
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:07,760
What is it?

742
01:04:11,013 --> 01:04:11,848
Woo-jin.

743
01:04:15,601 --> 01:04:17,562
I think I've become a bloodhound.

744
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:38,249
Gun-woo, have you forgotten
about the heart of a boxer?

745
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:41,878
We just have to find our way back.

746
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:45,590
Okay? Let's go back together.

747
01:04:51,137 --> 01:04:51,971
Okay.

748
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:53,890
Let's go back.

749
01:05:02,815 --> 01:05:03,649
Here.

750
01:05:22,543 --> 01:05:23,711
Whoa! Woo-jin!

751
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:29,717
Man, we found it!

752
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:39,602
Hey.

753
01:05:39,685 --> 01:05:42,229
-Min-beom, where are you?
-I'm almost there.

754
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:44,482
Did you find the gold bars?

755
01:05:45,191 --> 01:05:46,651
Yes, we found them all.

756
01:05:47,818 --> 01:05:48,653
And the phone?

757
01:05:50,363 --> 01:05:51,489
I'll go get it.

758
01:05:52,198 --> 01:05:53,824
-Woo-jin, here.
-Right.

759
01:05:53,908 --> 01:05:55,409
-Yes.
-Let's go.

760
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:05,252
How'd things go?

761
01:06:05,336 --> 01:06:07,213
I finally got the phone.

762
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:11,509
They did a good job.

763
01:06:12,009 --> 01:06:15,012
I asked Interpol for backup.
They'll be waiting in Vietnam.

764
01:06:16,013 --> 01:06:17,181
It's all over.

765
01:06:17,264 --> 01:06:19,350
You really went through a lot, kiddo.

766
01:06:19,433 --> 01:06:20,393
Thanks, Gang-yong.

767
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:38,077
What would you guys like to do?

768
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:48,713
Mr. Choi always wanted to help the poor
get proper medical treatment,

769
01:06:49,964 --> 01:06:53,467
so I'd like this money to be used
in accordance with Mr. Choi's wishes.

770
01:06:53,551 --> 01:06:55,886
Well, what do you think?

771
01:06:57,555 --> 01:06:59,306
You don't want the money for yourself?

772
01:07:03,102 --> 01:07:05,229
Well, of course, I do.

773
01:07:06,105 --> 01:07:08,190
But this isn't my money.

774
01:07:08,941 --> 01:07:12,194
I've only paid back Mr. Choi
for his kindness

775
01:07:12,278 --> 01:07:14,196
and kept my promise to him.

776
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:17,158
Okay.

777
01:07:18,492 --> 01:07:19,326
Guys.

778
01:07:20,244 --> 01:07:24,165
We have a total of 168 golden bars,
weighing seven kilograms each.

779
01:07:24,248 --> 01:07:27,835
Each one is worth 500 million won
at spot price. About 84 billion in total.

780
01:07:28,586 --> 01:07:30,921
If you want, I'll take this

781
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:33,966
and start a welfare foundation
under Iil Group.

782
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:38,304
Through that foundation, we'll be able
to provide medical help to those in need.

783
01:07:39,263 --> 01:07:42,308
Or should I just have
our company add some money

784
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:44,685
and set up a hospital?

785
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:47,313
-That sounds like a great idea.
-Right?

786
01:07:47,396 --> 01:07:48,397
It does.

787
01:07:48,481 --> 01:07:50,357
I think my dad will like it.

788
01:07:50,983 --> 01:07:53,319
And I think it'll help
with our corporate image.

789
01:07:53,402 --> 01:07:55,196
Besides, we'd be doing the world good.

790
01:07:55,279 --> 01:07:58,616
I'll get started on it
once I'm done with the hotel.

791
01:07:58,699 --> 01:08:02,912
Min-beom, could you include
Mr. Choi's name in the hospital name?

792
01:08:03,954 --> 01:08:06,499
-What was his name?
-It's Choi Tae-ho.

793
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:09,835
To be honest, it won't be easy,

794
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:12,379
but I'll consider it.

795
01:08:12,463 --> 01:08:13,631
Thank you.

796
01:08:21,472 --> 01:08:22,473
What?

797
01:08:22,556 --> 01:08:24,600
I'll cover the missing amount
with my own money.

798
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:27,269
Think of it as a bonus
for a job well done.

799
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:29,855
It's all right. I'm really okay.

800
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:32,441
Mr. Choi would have done the same.

801
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:34,068
Take it.

802
01:08:39,031 --> 01:08:41,408
Don't know what to say?

803
01:08:44,245 --> 01:08:45,579
A thank you would do.

804
01:08:46,997 --> 01:08:48,666
Thank you, Mr. Choi.

805
01:08:48,749 --> 01:08:49,667
No.

806
01:08:51,001 --> 01:08:52,837
I should be thanking you.

807
01:08:55,714 --> 01:08:57,424
Thank you so much.

808
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:09,979
Catch!

809
01:09:10,062 --> 01:09:11,647
-No!
-Here we go!

810
01:09:12,606 --> 01:09:13,899
-I'll be here.
-There, okay?

811
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:15,109
I'll be here.

812
01:09:16,527 --> 01:09:17,778
This one too.

813
01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:21,407
Hey, Gun-woo.

814
01:09:22,324 --> 01:09:23,367
You're where?

815
01:09:25,911 --> 01:09:27,621
Hey! Gun-woo!

816
01:09:41,468 --> 01:09:42,469
My dear son.

817
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:48,976
Woo-jin.

818
01:09:50,769 --> 01:09:52,813
What happened to your face?

819
01:09:53,647 --> 01:09:55,608
You went through so much.

820
01:09:59,486 --> 01:10:01,488
It's all over, Mom. Let's go home.

821
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:03,032
All right.

822
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:06,702
I'm so proud of you boys.
