1
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:19,519
HONG MIN-BEOM

2
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:20,770
Gang-yong?

3
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,522
Yes. I'll be there in ten minutes.

4
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:25,150
Director Hong, don't hang up the phone.

5
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,193
Put it upside down on the table,

6
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,654
so I can listen. Do you understand?

7
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:40,749
Let me cut to the chase.

8
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:43,918
What are you doing?

9
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:51,926
Stop being a baby and sit still.

10
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:54,095
Hear me?

11
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:56,431
You bastard, what did you say?

12
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:57,932
Do you have a death wish?

13
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:02,145
You're making a huge fucking mistake,
you damn thug!

14
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:03,730
Tell him to shut up.

15
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:06,274
Gang-yong.

16
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,819
-Be quiet!
-I'll make sure you rot in prison forever!

17
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:10,779
You son of a bitch!

18
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,949
Fuck! Shut the hell up,
you son of a bitch!

19
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:19,120
Jackass.

20
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:22,832
Are you calm now?

21
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,459
GANG-YONG

22
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:26,669
Answer me.

23
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,005
What do you want?

24
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,967
There's a report that came in
from Yeongmoonpo Police Department today.

25
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:34,385
A guy on a motorcycle slashed

26
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:37,347
a man's neck with a knife
in a parking lot, then got away.

27
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:39,057
Write this down.

28
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:44,479
Seoul, Gangdong, A 6438.

29
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:48,024
It's a fake plate number,
so it won't show up in the database.

30
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,527
Find where the guy
on this motorcycle went.

31
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,613
In order to find this--

32
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:55,365
I know it's hard and time-consuming.

33
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:57,242
That's why I called you.

34
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:00,453
It's 10:00 p.m. I'll give you five hours.

35
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:01,913
If you can't find him,

36
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:06,251
your little cousin's strip show
will go online.

37
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:09,045
Try to pull something on me,
and it'll also go online.

38
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:13,258
If you don't want to see lil Group's
stock prices go down tomorrow morning…

39
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:14,175
Get it done.

40
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:19,430
What is it?

41
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:21,599
735629.

42
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,316
See you again.

43
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,156
Fuck!

44
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,190
BLOODHOUNDS

45
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,114
Hello, sir.

46
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,074
-Come here, you punk.
-Salute!

47
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:21,117
Damn it.

48
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,036
Soju's on me. I'll buy.

49
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,212
-This way, sir.
-Thank you.

50
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:33,922
-Hello, sir.
-Hi.

51
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:40,011
They boil the body for days
until the bones get soft.

52
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:42,430
Then they grind them
and pour them into the ocean.

53
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:44,557
Fifteen million
to get rid of a body that way.

54
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,476
You won't be able to find a bone.

55
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:49,145
Who boils people in stew?
These sick fucks.

56
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:50,730
Who did you hear it from?

57
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:52,982
Seung-deok in prison.

58
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,193
How does he know all that from prison?

59
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:57,862
Prison is always the fastest source
of information.

60
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:00,823
Are you guys all right?

61
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:02,992
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

62
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,536
Witnessing that couldn't have been easy.

63
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:11,626
By the way, what will happen
when the casino opens?

64
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:12,710
What do you mean?

65
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:15,588
Kim Myeong-gil will rake in the money.

66
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,006
-I see.
-Gun-woo.

67
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:18,341
Yes, sir.

68
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:22,428
Gambling and drug addicts tend
to take out a lot of private loans.

69
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:25,556
Kim Myeong-gil plans to connect
the casino with moneylending.

70
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:30,478
The more people visit his casino,
the more people will take out loans.

71
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:32,981
Money will flow in every day.

72
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,984
But only foreigners can go to casinos.

73
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:38,820
Do you think he cares?

74
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:39,821
Oh.

75
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,490
He'll let big spenders in
through the back.

76
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:44,325
They won't make a lot operating legally.

77
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:49,289
Once he's made enough money,
he'll take out a loan and buy a building.

78
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,999
Then he'll use that as collateral

79
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,668
for a bigger loan
and buy an even bigger building.

80
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,713
That bastard is really something.

81
00:04:56,796 --> 00:05:00,258
He'll go harder running the casino
to pay back that loan.

82
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:03,177
And Smile Capital will squeeze
even more people dry.

83
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,722
It'll be the opening
of Kim Myeong-gil's empire.

84
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:23,781
Myeong-gil roughly stole
over 20 billion from me back then.

85
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:26,284
Once we get it back,

86
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:29,829
shall we go on a world trip
with Gun-woo and Woo-jin?

87
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:33,082
We have enough money as is.

88
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:36,002
Yes,

89
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:38,963
but we can't go anywhere
because of COVID-19.

90
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,674
Well…

91
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:44,635
Let's go to Rome.

92
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:48,556
Why Rome?

93
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,226
When I was 20, I watched
a film called Roman Holiday.

94
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:56,356
I vowed to go someday
when I made a lot of money,

95
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,857
but I haven't had the chance.

96
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:01,611
I thought it might be nice
to go with you all,

97
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,863
the three of you.

98
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,827
I'll buy you guys anything you want.

99
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:14,040
Grandpa, there are
a lot of expensive things in Italy.

100
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:15,541
It's the land of luxuries.

101
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,711
Hey, who do you think you're talking to?

102
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,672
I'll show you how it's done.

103
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,803
Grandpa, that's called "flex."

104
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:31,474
Yes, I'll show you how to "flex."

105
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,020
You don't show anything.
You just say "flex."

106
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:48,282
Right, let's all go together
once this is all finished.

107
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:05,591
Yes, sir.

108
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:08,302
Okay, that sounds good.

109
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:10,179
Yes, sir.

110
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,392
Mr. Choi invited us to come over
for drinks at his place.

111
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,020
I guess he's in a good mood.

112
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:20,773
Do you guys drink?

113
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:22,775
We'd love to go!

114
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,457
Can you speed it up?

115
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:21,834
Do you want double or quadruple-speed?

116
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,252
-Let's do double.
-Okay.

117
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:32,053
If I were Kim Myeong-gil,

118
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:35,681
I would've moved the hard drive
to a safer location,

119
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:38,434
assuming that Im Jang-do revealed
all of his weaknesses.

120
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,771
Do you think he's able to pull that off?

121
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,899
We've tied down
Kim Myeong-gil's arms and legs.

122
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:48,528
He has no one left to mobilize
except for Jung now.

123
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,238
Besides,

124
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:54,116
I don't think Kim would entrust
just anyone with that information.

125
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:56,911
He doesn't have to move it far.

126
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,413
If he hid it in the trunk,
we wouldn't know.

127
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:01,541
Kim Myeong-gil knows that.

128
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,251
You're right.

129
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:07,255
If we were to recruit
an enemy of his over to our side,

130
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:09,215
the tides would turn in our favor.

131
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,970
But in order to do that,
we need the hard drive.

132
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:17,598
It should contain a lot of information
on Myeong-gil's blackmail victims.

133
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,643
Those people have the same motive as us.

134
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:26,399
There will be many powerful people,
like the Iil Group heir.

135
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,821
The longer this fight goes on,
the more were at a disadvantage.

136
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:35,741
I'm sure Myeong-gil has made
a vast network of connections by now.

137
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:39,996
He will have every cop, prosecutor,
and politician that could be bought off

138
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,039
in his pocket by now.

139
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,668
If we let our guard down
for even a moment, we'll lose our edge.

140
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:47,545
Right.

141
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:51,173
But it's true we took down
three of his cronies, right?

142
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:52,717
Yes.

143
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:56,262
You're bound to get anxious
if you think too far ahead.

144
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:59,599
The way I see it,
I think we're all doing pretty well.

145
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,225
No one's gotten hurt so far.

146
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:02,727
That's right.

147
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,271
Let's take things one at a time.

148
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:08,274
We can take Kim Myeong-gil down,
then his company.

149
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:12,194
Besides, now that Im Jang-do
and Kim Jun-min are gone,

150
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,530
Kim Myeong-gil probably got
a reality check.

151
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,951
I guess you have a point.

152
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:22,163
Well…

153
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,792
Right.

154
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,461
Mr. Choi. Dear seniors.

155
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:36,135
I would like to propose a toast
for our safety and our shared goal.

156
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:40,014
When I lead with,
"Let's find that hard drive,"

157
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:45,186
please follow up with,
"Kim Myeong-gil is done for."

158
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:47,355
Let's get started.
Please raise your glasses.

159
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:51,692
Let's find that hard drive.
Kim Myeong-gil is…

160
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,694
-Done for!
-Done for!

161
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,539
Yes, I'm going to Joongang Station.

162
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,291
Those bastards went
from Dongpa-gu to Joongang-gu.

163
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,836
Can you find them by 3:00 p.m.?

164
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,797
I can if they stopped in Joongang-gu,

165
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,007
but if they crossed over
to another district,

166
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,551
I'll have to keep looking.

167
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:01,512
Please help me.

168
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:03,097
Don't worry about it.

169
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,725
We'll do what the bastard wants for now.

170
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,979
Once it's done, I'll think of a way
to fuck this guy up.

171
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:11,731
Thank you.

172
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:16,527
Min-beom, you think I'd leave some bastard
messing with my family alone?

173
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,404
Don't worry.

174
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:19,572
Okay?

175
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:21,198
You're all I have.

176
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:24,243
Don't drink too much, okay?

177
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,786
Okay.

178
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:49,226
Gosh. Why did he drink so much
if he's such a lightweight?

179
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,352
I guess

180
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,772
he was in a good mood today.

181
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,815
I'm sleepy. What about you?

182
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,400
I'm heading back downstairs.

183
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,235
-Aren't you tired?
-Yes, I'm fine.

184
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:02,782
Good work today.

185
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:03,824
Sure.

186
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:10,956
Gun-woo.

187
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,292
Gun-woo.

188
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:16,253
Mom, aren't you asleep?

189
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:18,923
No, why are you awake?

190
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:21,008
I'm having a drink
with everyone downstairs.

191
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,928
-You're drinking too?
-No, of course not.

192
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:24,887
Goodness.

193
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,933
I'll make hangover soup in the morning.

194
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,935
Okay. Get some sleep. I'll close the door.

195
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,561
Okay, sleep tight.

196
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,813
Good night.

197
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:38,859
It's nice drinking with you
after such a long time.

198
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,171
Is it a woman?

199
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:00,631
Yes.

200
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:02,842
Who would call you at this hour?

201
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,556
Tell me.

202
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:11,600
Yang-jung.

203
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:15,688
I'm going to be a dad.

204
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,524
When?

205
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,985
In two months. It's a girl.

206
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,698
We've been together for over three years.

207
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:30,077
If you had family,
you should've told me, you punk!

208
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,746
Come on. Then you would've
told me not to come.

209
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,544
Go home. I'll wrap things up here.

210
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,963
No, it's been a while
since we had a drink together.

211
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,131
I'm staying.

212
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,632
I said go home.

213
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,093
Man, that temper of yours.

214
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:49,889
Hey.

215
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,266
I'm good. I don't need it.

216
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:55,352
It's not for you. Get your wife some meat.

217
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,980
Iron intake is important
for pregnant women. Come on.

218
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,817
This is too much.

219
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:06,113
Are you coming?

220
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:07,323
Yes, I'm coming.

221
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,325
-All right. I'll go on ahead.
-Sure.

222
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,078
Call a cab.

223
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,414
I'll have another smoke
until it gets here.

224
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:18,208
Yang-jung.

225
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:22,630
Thanks.

226
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,466
Cut it out.

227
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,512
You're the best.

228
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:33,307
I'm going to get some hanwoo
on my way back.

229
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,731
Hyeon-ju says she's going to bed first.

230
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:41,649
Okay.

231
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,027
Are you all right?

232
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:46,570
Yes, sir.

233
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,496
You must be really worried.

234
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:59,291
I'm the one who taught Myeong-gil.
He's my responsibility.

235
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,211
But after my body broke down like this,

236
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,213
I didn't have the courage

237
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:06,674
to fight him.

238
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,803
The only thing I could do was

239
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:14,848
to take care of Hyeon-ju.

240
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:26,795
Who are you?

241
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:28,589
Well,

242
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:30,674
I'm…

243
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,218
your dad's friend.

244
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:40,934
Don't cry.

245
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:42,436
Please don't cry.

246
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,484
Dad!

247
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,617
CONDOLENCES

248
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:58,911
What do you mean?

249
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:05,125
Fill up this hall with the best
condolence flowers you can find.

250
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,043
Yes, sir.

251
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:09,546
Have ten of our men guard overnight
until they transport the coffin.

252
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,132
-Should we arm them?
-No.

253
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,843
It's because a kid is all by herself.

254
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,178
Tell them to get her fed.

255
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,221
Yes, sir.

256
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:21,391
Sir, I think you left your scarf inside.

257
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:22,768
No, never mind that.

258
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:27,189
By the way, why'd he kill himself?

259
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,984
He delivered papers in the morning,
assembled fan parts all day,

260
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,778
and worked as a chauffeur at night.

261
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:36,448
He got three hours of sleep, working
graveyard shifts to save his daughter.

262
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,408
He endured that for two years.

263
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,619
His child got better. Why kill himself?

264
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:42,788
I don't see why.

265
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:45,916
I lent him the money without any interest,

266
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:47,501
so he only owed the principal.

267
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:51,213
I said I'd give him an infinite extension
if he needed more time.

268
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:00,347
I'll look into it.

269
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,307
I don't understand.

270
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:11,400
There.

271
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:16,864
Third floor.

272
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:26,874
Excuse me.

273
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:29,960
You scared me.

274
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:33,505
Are you on your way
to Mr. Cha Sang-ho's funeral?

275
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,008
I am.

276
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:43,307
Two years ago, when I had back surgery
and couldn't lift heavy things,

277
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:48,353
Hyeon-ju's dad took out the trash for me
for three months.

278
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:50,814
Goodness.

279
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:54,610
He was the nicest,
most hard-working person around.

280
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:57,779
I felt so bad for Hyeon-ju.

281
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,450
That poor little thing was sick
without a mother around.

282
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,828
I used to feed her and stock their fridge,

283
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,206
so they didn't run out of food.

284
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:11,168
Why would a man like that kill himself
now that Hyeon-ju has gotten better?

285
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:14,421
It's because of those loan shark bastards!

286
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:17,966
They came over whenever they pleased,

287
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,093
grabbing him by the neck and beating him.

288
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,054
Oh, dear me.

289
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:23,096
What did they look like?

290
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:27,893
One was built like a bear,

291
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:31,104
and the other one was really tall.

292
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,359
One month later,

293
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:39,446
another person I lent money to
killed themselves.

294
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:44,743
The person also had a sick family member,
so I gave them an interest-free loan.

295
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:47,663
I'm going home too soon.

296
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:51,166
Watch the stairs.

297
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:56,713
God, my brother.

298
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,096
I'll be going now.

299
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:07,224
-Get home safe.
-Okay.

300
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,060
Good night, Yang-jung.

301
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,277
Yang-jung later found out

302
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:23,615
that the people I extended these loans to
for their families' medical expenses…

303
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,411
had been visited by Myeong-gil.

304
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,454
He went around taking several million

305
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,915
in loan extension fees
from those people every month,

306
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,711
telling them that I had ordered it.

307
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:40,215
My mom fell for the same trick.

308
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,344
He hid a clause in fine print
within the contract.

309
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,098
I see.

310
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:51,143
I'm sorry.

311
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,228
Not at all.

312
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,856
A lot of people got hurt because of me.

313
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:57,607
That's not true.

314
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:01,320
Don't be sorry, Mr. Choi.

315
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:04,197
You have a strong sense of responsibility,

316
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:07,284
which is also why you feel so much guilt.

317
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:10,871
Those who are truly shameless
feel no guilt whatsoever.

318
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:15,334
They always blame others
and prey on those weaker than them.

319
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:22,215
I believe we have all gathered here
thanks to the goodwill you've spread.

320
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:28,013
I don't think Hyeon-ju knows
that you bought the orphanage for her,

321
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:31,016
but she believes in you
with all her heart.

322
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:35,103
We'll bring Kim Myeong-gil down
no matter what.

323
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,481
So please stop blaming yourself,

324
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:41,276
and look after your health, sir.

325
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:59,836
Once this is all over, I'll set you up
with your very own private boxing gym

326
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:04,049
that can help you focus on
your training until you become champion.

327
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:08,845
And I'll build a nice big café
for your mom on the first floor.

328
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:12,057
No rent until the day I die.

329
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:14,559
Well…

330
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:20,273
Don't know what to say?

331
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,191
No.

332
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,736
A thank you would do.

333
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:26,988
I see.

334
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,533
Thank you, Mr. Choi.

335
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:30,534
No.

336
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:34,413
I should be thanking you.

337
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:38,458
You're teaching me
what youth is all about.

338
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:41,878
This is…

339
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:47,467
Do you like it?

340
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:48,718
Well, yes.

341
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:54,599
Let's look there.

342
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:56,518
-Here?
-No, the one next to it.

343
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:57,519
All right.

344
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,078
How about that part?

345
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:16,872
All right.

346
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:32,304
-Thank you.
-Okay.

347
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:33,221
Good work.

348
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,487
GANG-YONG

349
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:52,824
-Yes.
-88 Onyu-ro.

350
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:54,784
Happy now?

351
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,204
Thank you for your hard work.

352
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:10,008
-Let's go.
-Yes, sir!

353
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:32,090
I guess President Choi is on crutches now.

354
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,273
They tortured him with salt water.

355
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:51,776
You think Jang-do ratted us out?

356
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,737
I'm not sure, sir.

357
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:59,284
In this case,
it's safe to assume that he did.

358
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:02,078
Let's get President Choi first,

359
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,332
then get him.

360
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:07,542
Yes, sir.

361
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:13,465
Sir.

362
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:21,056
LEE DU-YEONG

363
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:32,025
Don't get worked up
and kill him or anything.

364
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,027
I need to ask him something.

365
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:34,944
Yes, sir.

366
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,906
-And take off that thing on your ear.
-Right.

367
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:08,603
Du-yeong.

368
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:11,940
I think someone's at the door.

369
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:29,332
Who is it?

370
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:33,128
I'm from downstairs.
There's water leaking from my ceiling.

371
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:36,172
Can I briefly come in
to check your bathroom?

372
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,721
I promise it won't take long.
My house is flooded.

373
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,266
My kids can't sleep.

374
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,270
I'd really appreciate it.

375
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:54,482
Right now?

376
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,109
Yes, it won't take long.

377
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,486
I'll just check the situation.

378
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:13,001
Honey?

379
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:14,586
Yes?

380
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,841
-Who is it?
-He says water is leaking downstairs.

381
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,512
-Move over.
-What?

382
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:25,430
Move over.

383
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,278
-Just a second.
-Okay.

384
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:59,047
Honey, call the cops
and report a burglary in progress.

385
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:00,882
Why?

386
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,300
I'll explain later.

387
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,135
You trust me, right?

388
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:05,929
Yes.

389
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:07,263
And

390
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:09,057
no matter what happens,

391
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,268
do not open the door.

392
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:13,686
Okay.

393
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:16,523
Okay.

394
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:18,775
It's all right, honey.

395
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:20,777
Nothing's going to happen. It's all right.

396
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:26,908
Jeez.

397
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:52,392
Samjin-dong, Dongjak-gu.

398
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:10,159
Please hurry. My husband's in danger.

399
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:24,048
-Hey, hurry and jump over.
-We need to get him out of there.

400
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,303
What the fuck?

401
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:30,805
Fuck!

402
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:35,101
Fuck, you bastard!

403
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:38,146
You bastard!

404
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:59,000
Motherfucker! Son of a bitch!

405
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:03,087
Get up, you fucker!

406
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:07,342
Son of a bitch!

407
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,710
If you tell me where Hwang Yang-jung is,

408
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:26,671
I'll let your girl live.

409
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:32,760
I always keep my promise

410
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,179
no matter what.

411
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:42,645
You can trust me.

412
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:15,011
-Did you sleep well, Mr. Choi?
-I did.

413
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:17,722
Did you sleep well?

414
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:19,015
-And you?
-I did.

415
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:22,935
Come on over.

416
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,274
I can't believe this is happening.

417
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:30,985
Indeed. This is quite the gathering.

418
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:34,197
Woo-jin, get up. Okay?

419
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,239
Let's eat.

420
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:40,203
-Thank you so much.
-Not at all.

421
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:45,291
-He's not coming?
-He won't get up.

422
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:47,668
You should've told him to eat
and then sleep.

423
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:49,629
He drank a lot yesterday.

424
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:50,922
He did.

425
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:53,132
I guess being good at drinking
was all talk.

426
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:55,635
Let's eat now.

427
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:56,928
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

428
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:58,471
Thank you for this meal.

429
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:11,067
-Gun-woo.
-Yes, Mr. Choi.

430
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,361
When are you taking your mother
to the orphanage?

431
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:16,531
Let me borrow your car, Grandpa.
I'll do it.

432
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:20,076
It was parked out there for a while.
It might be dangerous, so be careful.

433
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:21,786
-I'll take care of it.
-All right.

434
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:24,956
Want to go after we eat?
It'll only take us an hour at this time.

435
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:27,542
Mom, is that okay?

436
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,293
Well,

437
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:34,715
I think I'd feel better if I stayed here,
preparing meals for everyone.

438
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:38,636
Mrs. Yoon.

439
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:42,098
I don't mean to impose,

440
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:45,476
but would you mind helping out
at our orphanage?

441
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:50,106
Your cooking skills are really impressive.

442
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,733
I think the children would love it.

443
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:57,029
This food is just amazing.

444
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:03,244
Mom, I think that would be for the best.

445
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:10,459
Yes, if it helps in any way.

446
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:11,377
Thank you.

447
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:14,130
Sure.

448
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:30,688
You won't skip meals
even without me, right?

449
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:33,191
Of course.

450
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:41,782
Stay safe.

451
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:44,869
Okay.

452
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:51,584
Don't worry too much.

453
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:56,672
I believe in my son.

454
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:57,632
Okay.

455
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:21,030
HWANGSUSA

456
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:31,916
SECURITY DISABLED

457
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:36,796
Min-dong.

458
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:29,348
How did you find me?

459
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:31,434
Well,

460
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:34,520
Lee Du-yeong told me.

461
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:39,275
Did you do something to his girl?

462
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,068
Whoa.

463
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:44,655
Did you kill them?

464
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:27,771
Let's go.

465
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:51,420
Mr. Choi!

466
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,591
-Kim Myeong-gil's thugs are here.
-What are you talking about?

467
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:06,518
Let's go to the basement. There's a gun.

468
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:20,824
I'll stay behind. Hurry and get the gun.

469
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:22,326
Hey, Woo-jin!

470
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:23,410
Damn it.

471
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,162
-Woo-jin, get out!
-Get the gun!

472
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:26,455
Woo-jin, come here!

473
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:35,130
-Hey, get him!
-Woo-jin!

474
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:37,591
-Woo-jin!
-Fuck.

475
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:39,259
Get out of there!

476
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:44,848
Hey, you son of a bitch!

477
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:46,225
Get down there fast!

478
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:51,563
Fuck!

479
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:56,819
-Get in there!
-Hey!

480
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:09,039
You son of a bitch!

481
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:15,754
Hey, go!

482
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:19,133
You punk!

483
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:22,052
Hey!

484
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:31,019
Get out!

485
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:53,959
Fuck!

486
00:45:55,335 --> 00:45:56,545
You son of a bitch!

487
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:41,048
Fuck.

488
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:42,633
You son of a bitch!

489
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:09,117
Woo-jin!

490
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:27,845
Woo-jin!

491
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:18,520
Where is he?

492
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:19,563
This way, sir.

493
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:21,899
-Get pouring.
-Yes, sir.

494
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:30,240
Blood, damn it.

495
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:47,633
Good job.

496
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:48,967
Yes, sir.

497
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:56,850
I owe you…

498
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:00,354
a debt of gratitude.

499
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:01,939
Over here.

500
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:05,192
See,

501
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,194
you gave me a dream.

502
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:08,946
You…

503
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:16,078
That's why…

504
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:20,666
I'm going to make this painless.

505
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:22,125
It's all right.

506
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:27,005
It'll be over quickly. It's all right.

507
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:29,049
Yes, there you go.

508
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:36,098
Yes, it's all right.

509
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:21,184
Gun-woo.

510
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:38,243
-Try the back door.
-Okay.

511
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:53,508
Woo-jin!

512
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:06,897
Woo-jin!

513
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:36,384
Hyeon-ju!

514
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:39,096
Hyeon-ju!

515
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:45,435
Just hold on.

516
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:48,188
Grandpa.

517
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:52,567
Grandpa.

518
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:56,446
Grandpa…

519
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:58,865
Oh God. Grandpa.

520
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,284
Grandpa.

521
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:06,414
Get up.

522
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:14,589
Oh God. Gun-woo!

523
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:16,883
Grandpa!

524
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:18,426
Jeez. Gun-woo!

525
00:52:19,886 --> 00:52:22,389
Grandpa, please get up.

526
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:26,560
Gun-woo, please help.

527
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:30,939
Grandpa, please…

528
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:32,691
-Hyeon-ju, we have to get out.
-No!

529
00:52:32,774 --> 00:52:35,277
-We have to! Hurry!
-No, we can't! Let go!

530
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,570
You'll die if you stay!

531
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:39,906
Grandpa!

532
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:45,120
Grandpa!

533
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:00,719
Scalpel.

534
00:53:04,806 --> 00:53:06,433
Prepare some more gauze, please.

535
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:13,190
How's the patient?

536
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:15,317
BP's at 80/50!
Beginning blood transfusion!

537
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,236
We're short on blood due to COVID.
We need an outside source.

538
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,030
Get us as much as you can.

539
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:29,080
What do we do?

540
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:31,374
-Then what do we do?
-If there's anyone else--

541
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:32,876
-Gun-woo!
-What is it?

542
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:34,502
Not enough blood for Woo-jin.

543
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:36,171
-What?
-What's your blood type?

544
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:37,756
It's Type A.

545
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:39,049
-Come with me.
-Okay.

546
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:45,180
I'll save Woo-jin no matter what,
so don't worry. Okay?

547
00:53:45,263 --> 00:53:46,264
Okay.

548
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,488
He's bleeding a lot.

549
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:04,032
Please prepare plenty of blood.

550
00:54:05,116 --> 00:54:06,076
We need more gauze.

551
00:54:06,868 --> 00:54:07,953
Please hurry.

552
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:10,997
It's done.

553
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:13,458
Is this enough to save Hong Woo-jin?

554
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:15,585
No, I think we'll need a couple more.

555
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:16,503
I see.

556
00:54:17,003 --> 00:54:19,172
Then let me fill up another one.

557
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:21,466
We already got 320 ml.
Any more will be risky.

558
00:54:21,549 --> 00:54:24,761
I'm all right. I'm a boxer.
It'll take more than this to kill me.

559
00:54:24,844 --> 00:54:25,762
-I'm okay.
-No.

560
00:54:25,845 --> 00:54:29,516
I really have to save him, please.

561
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:32,519
Please let me fill up another one.

562
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:34,145
-Please, I beg you.
-I can't.

563
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:35,981
This won't kill me, really.

564
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:39,985
Please, I have to save Woo-jin.

565
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:41,027
I have to save him.

566
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:46,324
Please, I'm begging you.
This won't kill me.

567
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:48,952
-I can't see due to the blood. Suction!
-Applying suction.

568
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:52,414
I can't control the bleeding.
Please prepare the Surgicel.

569
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:54,249
Surgicel ready.

570
00:54:54,332 --> 00:54:56,751
Keep it coming. I'll need more.

571
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:59,337
BP is dropping! Please hurry!
