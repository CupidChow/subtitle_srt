00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:21,146
BOSS

2
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:02,854
BLOODHOUNDS

3
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:05,857
Fuck. This is insane.

4
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,081
Mr. Bae.

5
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:23,541
Get me the address of the woman
who runs the café.

6
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,126
These shitheads are ready to fight.

7
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,003
You fuckers.

8
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,131
You sons of bitches!

9
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:38,598
Damn it!

10
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,155
Come here, you son of a bitch!

11
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,450
Damn it, you fuckers!

12
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:09,170
Damn it!

13
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:12,924
You bastard!

14
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,017
-Go at him all at once!
-You bastard.

15
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,663
Fuck!

16
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:48,585
You sons of bitches!

17
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,253
Come here!

18
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:54,132
This bastard!

19
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,273
Motherfucker!

20
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:15,778
Fuck him up!

21
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:19,365
You fucker!

22
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:28,625
Hey, you punk!

23
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:31,961
You bastard!

24
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,344
Damn it.

25
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:54,943
-You sons of bitches!
-You bastard!

26
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:19,425
Damn it!

27
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:35,525
Son of a…

28
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:38,987
Get over here!

29
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,113
Damn it!

30
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,129
Get up! Move!

31
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,072
-Let's go, Gun-woo.
-Okay.

32
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:25,116
-Let's go!
-Right.

33
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,580
Thanks for coming, Hyeon-ju.

34
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:32,707
I'm sorry I came late.

35
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,043
You saved us quite a beating.

36
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:38,212
Damn, that hurts.

37
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:53,895
Is that you, Gun-woo?

38
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:07,241
Gun-woo?

39
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,008
Hey, it's all right.

40
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:49,450
-Hurry up and move.
-Yes, sir.

41
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,125
Hey.

42
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:06,342
Who the fuck is he?

43
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,263
This is fucking annoying.

44
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:28,406
Fuck.

45
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,137
Hold on.

46
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,277
Fuck!

47
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,810
Who the fuck are you?

48
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:56,035
Shut your mouth, you bastard.

49
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,209
Get up!

50
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:29,944
God, stop!

51
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:53,843
Look at that.

52
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:58,931
Hey.

53
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,017
Who the hell are you?

54
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:02,935
-Sorry, sir.
-Stop.

55
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,813
I asked you a fucking question.

56
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,159
Sleep tight.

57
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:31,589
What is this?

58
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,633
When did I get hit like this?

59
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,603
MY LOVELY MOM

60
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:48,648
Yes, Mom.

61
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:49,732
Gun-woo.

62
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,736
Mom? What happened? Why are you crying?

63
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,989
Someone wants to talk to you.

64
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,370
Where are you guys?

65
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,313
Gun-woo.

66
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,194
Mom, what happened to your forehead?

67
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,488
It's all right.

68
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,658
I just bumped my head on the ground.

69
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,079
Your face…

70
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,419
Woo-jin, what happened to your face?

71
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:54,213
Well, it's just a scratch.

72
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,842
Mr. Choi's been worried sick
waiting for you.

73
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,301
Let's go down.

74
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:00,845
-Okay.
-Okay.

75
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,349
I'll be back.

76
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,563
Everyone, sit down!

77
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,740
I'm sure you're all tired,
so I'll keep this short.

78
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,411
When I got your call,

79
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,372
it felt like the end of the world for me.

80
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,917
You're my family.

81
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:36,547
I was so afraid that I might lose you.

82
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,091
I'll no longer condone you getting hurt.

83
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,969
Let the adults handle the rest.

84
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,097
-I also want to help.
-Gun-woo.

85
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:49,602
This isn't a match
where someone wins or loses.

86
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:53,272
This is a war that will only end
once someone's dead.

87
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:58,903
You two go upstairs.

88
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,332
I'm sorry.

89
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:13,459
Promise me
you'll never get involved again!

90
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:15,169
Okay.

91
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,881
They know where Gun-woo lives,
so it's dangerous to go there.

92
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,634
Take Gun-woo's mother
to the orphanage tomorrow.

93
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:23,803
It'll be much safer for her to stay there.

94
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:26,472
Okay.

95
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:28,849
Good night.

96
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,902
Yang-jung, what do we do now?

97
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:43,864
I'll put an end to this.

98
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:49,119
We should've taken care of this
a long time ago.

99
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,831
Can you get Myeong-gil?

100
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:54,375
I'll team up
with Du-yeong starting tomorrow.

101
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,544
I'll pick them off.

102
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:58,504
Let's eat with Du-yeong.

103
00:13:58,587 --> 00:13:59,922
Mr. Oh.

104
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:02,800
Please look into Myeong-gil's men.

105
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:03,759
Yes, sir.

106
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:36,185
Director, you're here
so early in the morning.

107
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,437
I had to come for you, Mr. Kim.

108
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,315
I operated on them myself.

109
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:42,900
I see. Thank you.

110
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:46,862
One of them had both
of his Achilles tendons cut with a knife.

111
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:51,033
The other had all of the tendons
in his shoulders severed.

112
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:05,589
He had short hair

113
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,342
and slanted eyes.

114
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,220
He was very quick on his feet.

115
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,181
And his knife skills were superb.

116
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,395
And?

117
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,688
Yes, well…

118
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,941
It appeared to be a sashimi knife.

119
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,237
Fuck.

120
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:35,744
Tell Beom to get to the office by 1 p.m.

121
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,788
-Let's have a meeting.
-Yes, sir.

122
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:40,040
Things just got interesting.

123
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:52,177
-Finish this up.
-Okay.

124
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:56,223
-Sir.
-Yes?

125
00:16:58,767 --> 00:16:59,810
I'll go with you.

126
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,396
Stay.

127
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,898
I want to help, sir.

128
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,025
Min-dong.

129
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,194
I'll take care of it myself.

130
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,822
You just live your life.

131
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:15,367
Sir, I want to join you!

132
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,410
Hey.

133
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,372
If the restaurant is in ruins
by the time I get back,

134
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,290
what will you do?

135
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:24,752
Protect the store.
That's how you can help me.

136
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:26,336
But still--

137
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:30,841
Watch the store.

138
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,056
Hwang Yang-jung!

139
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,808
It's been so long.

140
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,559
Why haven't you been in touch?

141
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,269
I was busy making a living.

142
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,897
How did your handsome face get so old?

143
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,774
Making an honest living isn't easy.

144
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:29,983
Right?

145
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,819
It's so hard. Isn't it?

146
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,572
-Man, it's been so long.
-Yes.

147
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:39,576
I called Su-cheol and Min-su
to have them look into it.

148
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,537
This is pretty big.

149
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,958
They aren't your average loan sharks.
Something's off about them.

150
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:48,502
Thank you.

151
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:49,419
Thanks.

152
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,843
A friend in Yeouido heard

153
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:59,847
that Iil Group purchased
an unfinished hotel building in Gangnam.

154
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:03,100
They got their money
from a company called Smile Capital.

155
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:04,560
Kim Myeong-gil's company.

156
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,353
Yeah,

157
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,315
but why would a chaebol borrow money
from Kim Myeong-gil? I don't get it.

158
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:14,236
Kim Myeong-gil probably
tricked them into it.

159
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:17,239
-Let's do some digging.
-Okay.

160
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,869
We're finally avenging our boys.

161
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:24,872
Let's end this.

162
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,166
Mr. Choi gave us his approval.

163
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:30,836
Okay.

164
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:36,300
Back in the day, President Choi
had five knifers working for him.

165
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:39,928
At the time, President Choi
lent money to corporations,

166
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,431
so he had 10 billion won
or more in uncollected money.

167
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,558
But places like
construction companies had gangs

168
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,186
that looked out for them.

169
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,229
That's when these guys would go.

170
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:53,317
They'd go out
and obliterate an entire gang in a day.

171
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,654
Back then, even the big gangs were
terrified of President Choi's knifers.

172
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:02,409
After I got President Choi out of the way,

173
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,495
the first thing I did with Beom

174
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:07,414
was get rid of his knifers.

175
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:08,665
Do you know why?

176
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:10,751
No, sir.

177
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,838
Because I was scared as shit too. Fuck.

178
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,800
Was it just you two?

179
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:23,347
We sent two gangs, one from Sindang-dong
and one from Yeongdeungpo, as a unit.

180
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,350
It was only possible
because they weren't together at the time.

181
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:28,602
Otherwise, it would have been impossible.

182
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:30,520
Whoa. That's amazing, sir.

183
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,022
But in the end,

184
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:35,525
I couldn't get rid of
the two most important ones.

185
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:40,113
Lee Du-yeong and Hwang Yang-jung.

186
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:43,742
President Choi's top lieutenants.

187
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:50,207
I ran into Lee Du-yeong once
when I was President Choi's lackey.

188
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,500
He's a handsome one.

189
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:55,587
This one time,
a gang leader was stuck in traffic,

190
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:58,090
so he had a smoke
with his window rolled down.

191
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:00,968
When he heard a motorcycle approaching,
he turned his head.

192
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:04,930
And Lee Du-yeong carved his face like this
with a sashimi knife and rode away.

193
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:07,474
His mouth got fucking big,
flapping around like this.

194
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,101
Shit, that's crazy.

195
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,104
Who's Hwang Yang-jung?

196
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:14,231
Well, they say…

197
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,819
he crippled 20 gang members

198
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,821
by severing their Achilles tendons.

199
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:23,073
He fights with two knives

200
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:25,534
and is rumored
to stab 100 times in one minute.

201
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:27,327
Fucking crazy, huh?

202
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:33,542
Right. Did you say
that three kids showed up?

203
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,545
Yes, sir. A girl showed up halfway.

204
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:40,215
I believe she's connected to
that bookstore I mentioned before.

205
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,637
It makes sense if he owns the bookstore.

206
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:49,725
That senile fuck must have crawled out
of the shadows to save his kids.

207
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:54,104
Do you know how much President Choi has?

208
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:59,776
I'd guess about 50 billion in cash.

209
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:03,113
That would cover the money
we're short on the casino.

210
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:08,744
Someone has to be looking out for us
up there. Don't you think?

211
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:14,916
Jang-do and Beom. Stake out the place
and bring me everything.

212
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:26,928
LOVE ORPHANAGE

213
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,227
Aren't you coming?

214
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:37,314
I don't want to go in. Make it quick.

215
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:39,900
All right. We'll be right back.

216
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,529
-Kids, this way.
-Look at this one.

217
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:45,614
This way, please.

218
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:50,202
It's a kid's room, so it's a bit small.

219
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:52,996
But it'll be fine to stay in.
Take your time looking around.

220
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:53,997
Thank you.

221
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:16,686
Mom, how do you like this place?
Hey, it's Woo-jin.

222
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,105
Hello, ma'am.

223
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,987
A friend from elementary school

224
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:29,616
works for one of Kim Myeong-gil's men,
so he was on the scene that day.

225
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,494
From what I've heard, things got intense.

226
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,996
They were waiting at the gas station.

227
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,998
And as soon as the Iil Group heir came in,

228
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,501
they locked him up,
beat him, and threatened him.

229
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:44,423
They must be the only ones in Korea
that would do that to the chaebol.

230
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:45,465
And?

231
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,217
They got a video of the guy…

232
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:01,148
This is Kim Jun-min,
the sales director at Smile Capital.

233
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:02,858
He has six priors for fraud.

234
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,861
Used car fraud,
credit card payment fraud, etc.

235
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,988
You name it, he's done it.

236
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:10,991
Apparently, he served
at Seoul Nambu Detention Center.

237
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:14,953
Im Jang-do was a cadet
at the Police University

238
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,039
until he got kicked out
for sexual harassment.

239
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:21,460
He has no priors. He's Smile Capital's
head of strategic planning.

240
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,128
That's unusual.

241
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:26,965
Having a guy who knows
how the police operate

242
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:29,509
would help them
avoid police investigations.

243
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:30,719
So, it's these two?

244
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:32,137
Yes.

245
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:33,889
What about their addresses?

246
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:35,891
I have one for this guy.

247
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,101
He lives in Saseong-dong.

248
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:40,020
We know his car and the plate number.

249
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,522
We should get moving fast.

250
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,275
They'll catch on soon.

251
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:46,193
Yes.

252
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,987
I'll take this one.

253
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:53,992
-Tomorrow night?
-But how far should we go?

254
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:56,536
What do you mean?
We should take them out for good.

255
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,082
I'll take Kim Myeong-gil.

256
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,001
He doesn't move alone.

257
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,838
Everything about him isn't
what it seems. Go with Du-yeong.

258
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,091
I'll just tail him.

259
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:14,888
Wasn't there a burly one with Myeong-gil?

260
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:16,014
Well, yes.

261
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:19,601
The detective agency asked for more time.

262
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:22,812
I'll look into it more.

263
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,189
Who is he?

264
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:28,109
The guy who threw me out the window
is as strong as an ox.

265
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:35,116
Sir, what will you do
about the cash in the bookstore?

266
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,952
We have to move it.

267
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,787
He knows the location.

268
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:41,748
Why don't we have the kids move the cash?

269
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:48,505
The thing is, we don't have time
and are short on manpower.

270
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:52,259
Those kids are no joke.

271
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:55,136
-They mowed down 30 men.
-Did you see it happen?

272
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,305
I went over, but they were on the ground.

273
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:00,850
Thirty men between the three of them,
without using knives…

274
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:02,686
They're not your average kids.

275
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:06,940
Sir, it should be fine
if they move it early in the morning.

276
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:08,567
Why don't you give them a chance?

277
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,652
Hyeon-ju's a smart kid too.

278
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,202
Okay, put it here.

279
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:21,746
Here.

280
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:25,834
This looks amazing.

281
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,005
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

282
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,590
-Thank you.
-Sure, hurry and eat.

283
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,592
You first, Hyeon-ju.

284
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,511
Okay, thank you.

285
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:46,688
Did you use our kimchi to make this?

286
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:47,772
Yes.

287
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:51,693
It tastes totally different
from when I make it.

288
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,696
It's easy. I'll teach you how.

289
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:57,365
Okay.

290
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,998
I wanted to ask something.

291
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:09,836
Is the orphanage run by Mr. Choi?

292
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,172
Well, yes.

293
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:14,966
According to Grandpa,
he used to be very poor.

294
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:18,053
His dream was to help those in need
if he made a lot of money.

295
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,471
I see.

296
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:22,891
Are you his granddaughter?

297
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:28,104
No. I was placed in the orphanage
after my parents passed away.

298
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:29,814
I see. I'm sorry.

299
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,567
Jeez. I shouldn't have brought that up.

300
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:34,944
No, not at all.

301
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:36,946
I'm sorry.

302
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:41,618
What kind of food do you enjoy, Hyeon-ju?

303
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:43,953
Well,

304
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:46,998
I like rolled omelets.

305
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,376
I see. Have some of this.

306
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,837
Oh! Where did all the rolled omelets go?

307
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:57,842
You should have left some for Hyeon-ju.

308
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:05,850
That's right. I wanted rolled omelets.

309
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,481
Let me make more.

310
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:12,565
No, that's all right.

311
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:14,901
No, this won't take long. Wait a minute.

312
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:16,903
Mom, make it big and thick.

313
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:18,321
All right.

314
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,614
A lot, please.

315
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,783
All right. I'll make them huge.

316
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:25,286
Hurry up and eat.

317
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:35,547
THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW, GO TO
THE BOOKSTORE AND GET ALL THE CASH OUT

318
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:53,773
KIM JUN-MIN

319
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:24,929
Take it easy.

320
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,208
-Did you pack everything?
-Yes.

321
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,992
Fuck. This is scary.

322
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:32,075
Start making the boxes.
I'll get the money.

323
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:33,826
How will we move these to the car?

324
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:34,994
We'll carry them.

325
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:37,747
No, that would take too long.
Do you have any trolleys?

326
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:40,458
Yes. In the storage room
downstairs on the left.

327
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:42,460
Woo-jin and I will go get them.

328
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:44,212
Arrange the money on the floor.

329
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:45,338
-Right.
-Let's go.

330
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:59,078
Hey, you're a tough one.

331
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,321
What are you doing?

332
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,281
Don't let him grab you.

333
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:37,408
-Who is that?
-The guy I mentioned before.

334
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,577
Fucking hell.

335
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,606
Hit and duck faster.

336
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:51,691
Okay.

337
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:35,151
You little shit.

338
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:18,861
Fuck.

339
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,165
Hey, you fuck!

340
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:11,182
Calm down. Stop, that's enough.

341
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:14,852
That's enough.

342
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,105
It's okay.

343
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:21,609
It's all over.

344
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:25,029
Everything's okay.

345
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,993
-Let's tie him up.
-Right.

346
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,540
-Let's find something to tie him with!
-Okay.

347
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:42,213
-You go check out that side.
-Okay.

348
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:48,552
Damn it.

349
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:55,768
Woo-jin!

350
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:58,145
Let's tie him.

351
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:02,400
Wait.

352
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,278
What the hell? What happened to you?

353
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:07,613
I got into a fucking fight.

354
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:08,572
Are you all right?

355
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:10,491
It's gonna hurt like a bitch tomorrow.

356
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:14,578
Why did you tie his hands to the front?
That's going to come off easily.

357
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:16,122
Well, I don't think so.

358
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:17,415
Should I tie it again?

359
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:19,750
Hurry up and tie him.
Gun-woo, get the trolley.

360
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:20,960
Okay.

361
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,003
Hold his feet.

362
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:27,967
All right. Let's go.

363
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:31,470
-Our jackets.
-Damn it. Hurry.

364
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:32,555
This one's expensive.

365
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:44,191
I had him cuffed up here.

366
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,280
He got away
because you cuffed him to a pipe.

367
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:52,199
You should have cuffed him up properly.

368
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,117
Damn it.

369
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:12,720
IM JANG-DO

370
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,641
What took you so long?

371
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,227
We've run into a bit of a problem.

372
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:21,145
And the money?

373
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:23,898
Don't worry. The money's still there.

374
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,524
Where are you off to?

375
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,193
I can't get in touch with In-beom.

376
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:29,737
My face and mouth are badly torn,

377
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:31,614
so I'll drop by the ER

378
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:33,407
before heading back to the scene.

379
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:34,408
What do you mean?

380
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,702
Clean up your mess before you go.

381
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:38,204
Yes. You're right, sir.

382
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:40,581
But my face is badly bleeding.

383
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:42,374
My teeth are all loose, so I should--

384
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:44,376
Hey, you fucking son of a bitch.

385
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:47,421
Call Jung. Gather his men
and take them down now.

386
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:51,884
I want their heads, got it?
Look at this fucker trying to play hooky.

387
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:53,469
Fucking hell. Do you wish to die?

388
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:57,223
Before I rip their heads off,
should I chop off yours first, asshole?

389
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,225
I'll do as you wish,

390
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:01,060
sir.

391
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:14,698
Move!

392
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:18,035
Hurry up and get in.

393
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:29,296
Throw it!

394
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:46,355
-Pop the trunk.
-All right.

395
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:48,148
Push!

396
00:42:58,117 --> 00:42:59,493
Be careful.

397
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:00,494
Hurry.

398
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:02,871
Damn it.

399
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:06,375
Okay, we're done.

400
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:07,876
Fuck. We have to get the safe.

401
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:09,837
Don't we have to leave now?

402
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:10,879
Go up first.

403
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:11,880
How much is there?

404
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:13,465
Billions, at least.

405
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:14,925
I'll help.

406
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,386
-You go up first.
-Well…

407
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:21,307
Hey, we have to get the billions.

408
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:23,601
Get the car running and wait.
We'll be back fast.

409
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,227
You have to hurry.

410
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:31,233
-Woo-jin, there's a bag under the cabinet.
-Okay.

411
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:37,740
Fuck! A gold bar?

412
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:41,035
-Jeez. Get packing!
-Right.

413
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:47,416
Dollars?

414
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,793
Don't just sit there. Get packing.

415
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:51,462
Got it.

416
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:23,035
Damn. Someone took a beating.

417
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:24,662
Are you all right?

418
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:28,582
Follow me.

419
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:44,056
Take it slow.

420
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:45,516
Why is there so much money?

421
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:51,063
Hurry up!

422
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:53,107
These are so damn heavy!

423
00:44:58,737 --> 00:44:59,613
All right.

424
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:06,704
Okay.

425
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:27,850
Call Gun-woo.

426
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:32,771
Yes, Woo-jin.

427
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:34,982
Stay on my tail.

428
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:36,316
Okay.

429
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:48,871
Fuck!

430
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:51,999
Damn it.

431
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:19,443
Gun-woo, can you speed up?

432
00:46:19,526 --> 00:46:21,779
I think the car is weighed down right now.

433
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:23,530
When I signal you, go ahead of me.

434
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:25,449
All right. I'll try.

435
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:31,705
Now, step on it!

436
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:42,174
Fuck.

437
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:12,913
Damn it.

438
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:22,965
Hurry up and get in.

439
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:39,982
They're coming. Go faster!

440
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:42,025
The car is acting up!

441
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:56,957
Fuck!

442
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:15,309
Fuck.

443
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:16,935
Damn it. Hold tight!

444
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:22,733
Damn it!

445
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:24,693
Woo-jin! Are you all right?

446
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:53,889
Here we go!

447
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:11,782
Push!

448
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:20,749
More!

449
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:25,504
Woo-jin!

450
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:32,219
Push to the right!

451
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:37,808
Push! More!

452
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:48,610
Step on it!

453
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:53,991
-Damn it.
-It stopped.

454
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:55,409
Fuck!

455
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:59,204
The car's done for. Get out.
We need to get the bags.

456
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:08,380
Run!

457
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:13,885
Run. Fast!

458
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:38,785
Hey!

459
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:42,706
Run faster!
