1
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:16,933
Run!

2
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:22,313
Run. Fast!

3
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,755
Hey!

4
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,010
Fuck!

5
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:53,428
Ditch the bag!

6
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:55,513
Fuck!

7
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:57,891
You bastard!

8
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:01,436
Start the car!

9
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:04,647
Hyeon-ju! Hurry up! Faster!

10
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:05,565
Run faster!

11
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:10,195
Hurry! Faster!

12
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,198
Start the car!

13
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,202
-Those bastards.
-Run faster!

14
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:18,286
Hurry!

15
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:22,290
Hurry up and get in!

16
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:24,793
Close the door, Woo-jin. The door!

17
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:37,263
Fuck.

18
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:04,249
BLOODHOUNDS

19
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:09,254
More people borrowed from Kim Myeong-gil
than we originally thought.

20
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:13,091
People entered the bar
at one-hour intervals.

21
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:15,635
Some of them came
in official police vehicles.

22
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:18,179
I don't know the name,

23
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:21,474
but there was a baseball player
I saw on TV.

24
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:27,105
Yes, well, I'm sure he's expanded
his reach over the years.

25
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,960
I knew Myeong-gil was an ex-convict.

26
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:53,756
He said he wanted a fresh start
while working for me.

27
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,885
He begged me desperately.

28
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:00,930
And I fell for it.

29
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:05,226
After Myeong-gil got me,

30
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,521
I went into hiding in Namhae with Mr. Oh.

31
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,900
That's when I heard rumors

32
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,528
that Myeong-gil started a company
with my money and bonds.

33
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:19,782
I should've been the one
to take care of him.

34
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,785
I taught him, after all.

35
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,334
But I didn't dare think about

36
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:33,171
going after him.

37
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:39,344
I stopped you
from going after Myeong-gil that time.

38
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:41,387
I'm sorry for that.

39
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:45,767
I was afraid I might lose you too.

40
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:54,317
You have always

41
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,404
cared for and protected me
as if I was family, sir.

42
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:01,449
I am always ready

43
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:06,120
to lay my life on the line for you, sir.

44
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,331
Thank you.

45
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,542
And I'm sorry.

46
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:21,678
Yes.

47
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:24,347
Is that so?

48
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:27,725
I see. Hurry on over.

49
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:35,358
Sir, it seems like the kids got jumped
by Kim Myeong-gil's men

50
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,069
while getting the money
from the bookstore.

51
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:38,987
Were they hurt?

52
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,489
No, there was no mention of that, but…

53
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,576
they lost all the money in the safe.

54
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,287
Were they hurt or not?

55
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:49,205
I think they're all right.

56
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,920
Also, they tied
one of them up in the building,

57
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,506
but they couldn't deal with him.
What should we do?

58
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:03,970
Whenever an ER receives a patient
that was injured doing illegal activities,

59
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:07,098
the doctors are obligated
to call the police.

60
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:10,268
That's why I had an arrangement
with a hospital

61
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:12,562
that was ready to operate at all times.

62
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,399
Myeong-gil must have
a hospital of his own.

63
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,652
I'll get Du-yeong on it.
A motorcycle will be useful.

64
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:12,622
Good job.

65
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:14,999
Hey.

66
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:19,420
Good job.

67
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:21,631
Right. Thank you.

68
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:26,219
You kids get some sleep first.
Come to my restaurant at lunchtime.

69
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:29,389
For what exactly do you…

70
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,766
For food.

71
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:33,476
I see.

72
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:36,437
Do you not want to?

73
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:39,399
I don't usually eat lunch.

74
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:40,942
-Come.
-All right.

75
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,319
Go on, then.

76
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:52,286
Hey.

77
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:58,793
Are you all right?

78
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:03,840
We lost all the money
in the safe. I'm sorry.

79
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,800
Did you get hurt?

80
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,262
I'm all right.

81
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:11,806
Then it's fine.

82
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:17,270
Right. Let me finish moving the boxes.
You should go to sleep first.

83
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,401
Are you sure you're not hurt?

84
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:28,865
Yes.

85
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,880
It's not that
I didn't pay them back. That guy…

86
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:29,592
In-beom is mostly fine,

87
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,969
but his right eardrum has ruptured.

88
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:35,723
I'll run the plate number
I got from the dashcam in the morning.

89
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:37,975
You still haven't done that?

90
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:41,604
The police haven't come to work yet.

91
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,608
I don't like your tone.

92
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,111
I like those eyes.

93
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:50,905
Damn it.

94
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,457
If they used an unregistered vehicle
or fake plates,

95
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,794
could you track how far it got
using security cameras?

96
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:08,798
It's possible, but it'll take a while.

97
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:12,260
License plates can be looked up
on the police Intranet easily.

98
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:16,180
But you have to go to the control center
and look through CCTVs one by one.

99
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,808
Each district has its own control center,

100
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,977
so I need time to get the right people.

101
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,939
Money isn't an issue,
so do it as soon as possible.

102
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:26,607
Yes, sir.

103
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:29,443
Find out who owns the building
the bookstore is in.

104
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,655
If it's President Choi,
you'll be able to find his home address.

105
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:34,365
Yes, sir.

106
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:37,618
Let me talk to Jang-do in private.

107
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:40,037
Excuse me?

108
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:43,457
Didn't you hear me?

109
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:48,421
Yes, sir.

110
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:12,737
Why do you think
they just left Beom there?

111
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,282
Maybe they were busy moving the money.

112
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,452
Jang-do. Come on.

113
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:23,039
Positive thinkers never improve.

114
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,291
Think negatively for a change.

115
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:29,128
Let the fear of those bastards

116
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:31,547
doing everything
in their power to kill you

117
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,549
drive your thoughts.

118
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:37,678
To tail him?

119
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:44,769
Allocate more men to the hospital.
Dress them up as patients and arm them.

120
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:46,437
Yes, sir.

121
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:49,857
Have guys tail Jun-min too.

122
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:54,028
Did he do something wrong?

123
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:57,281
Jeez. I told you to think negatively.

124
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:01,577
President Choi may have gotten
his personal details.

125
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,663
I see.

126
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:09,502
Jun-min is a coward.
It'll be written all over his face.

127
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,296
They might be able to tell
from a distance.

128
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,340
It's best that
he's kept in the dark. Okay?

129
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:16,092
Yes, sir.

130
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:22,098
I don't think they'll put Hwang Yang-jung
on the job for a small fry like him.

131
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:23,891
They'll send Lee Du-yeong.

132
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:27,186
I told you how he covers
a wide distance on his bike.

133
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:28,104
You did.

134
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:31,065
Block off his point of entry
and exit, and get him.

135
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,068
Yes, sir.

136
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,071
This should be fun.

137
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,099
Good morning, Mr. Choi.

138
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,059
Did you get any sleep?

139
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,644
Yes, I did.

140
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,105
You got back so late. You should rest.

141
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:12,857
I slept so deep that it was enough.

142
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,983
Right. Gun-woo.

143
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:16,277
I have something to talk to you about.

144
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,194
I see.

145
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:25,161
Hyeon-ju is a lonely child.

146
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,705
There's always a shadow
lurking in her heart.

147
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:28,622
I see.

148
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:33,085
That's why she acts cold
on purpose at times.

149
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:34,879
I see.

150
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:39,884
But Hyeon-ju's brightened up considerably
after meeting you and Woo-jin.

151
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:42,470
So I'm very thankful to you two.

152
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,556
We also enjoy being with Hyeon-ju.

153
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:49,143
Also, about the money
I paid you in advance,

154
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,020
it's gone.

155
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,647
I see.

156
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,775
Where did it go?

157
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,068
What I'm saying is we're even now.

158
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,612
I see. Why is that?

159
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:03,741
Do you know how much money you recovered
from the bookstore yesterday?

160
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:05,743
Well…

161
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:14,668
I'm giving you a bonus
for safely transporting my money.

162
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:15,586
I see.

163
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:19,548
I'd like to pay it back
by working off my debt.

164
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,383
You've earned it.

165
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:24,845
You all retrieved a considerable sum.

166
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:30,935
Also, you are no longer indebted to me.

167
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:36,440
Take your mother and open a new café
someplace nice, like Jeju Island.

168
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,152
I'll make the necessary investments.

169
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,866
Thank you so much, Mr. Choi.

170
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:49,954
But I'd like to help you
catch Kim Myeong-gil

171
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:52,081
to the very end.

172
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,707
You've helped enough.

173
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,418
Not at all. I would like to see this
through to the end.

174
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,754
Why is that?

175
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:00,965
I need to return the favor.

176
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,008
You've done enough.

177
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,718
It's not enough for me.

178
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,097
It isn't over until it's over.

179
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,393
I see.

180
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,355
It's not over until it's over.

181
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,859
Let's grab a drink sometime soon.

182
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,945
Well, I don't drink.

183
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:24,530
Jeez.

184
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:26,532
But I can pour your drinks.

185
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:32,580
-Go on upstairs.
-Yes, sir.

186
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,900
Put some wasabi on it,
and have it with soy sauce.

187
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,005
This is from the wild.

188
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,841
You see, farmed halibut

189
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,886
has a lot of fat in its fins
and can be a little too heavy.

190
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:32,139
But wild ones like these
have a springy texture

191
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:33,933
and even fat distribution.

192
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:37,645
The unique, clean flavor of halibut
is absolutely…

193
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,315
I can feel it every time I chew.

194
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:43,150
It's also aged to perfection.

195
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,821
Are you into sashimi?

196
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:51,575
Well, I worked briefly as
a sashimi restaurant YouTuber back then.

197
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,328
I quit because I couldn't get over
1,000 subscribers.

198
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:57,706
Jeez. This is my first time eating
such a long cut.

199
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,209
It wraps around in my mouth like a whip.

200
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:03,671
This is the best halibut
I've ever had, sir.

201
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:05,547
Like.

202
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,258
Whoa, Woo-jin. You're amazing.

203
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,636
Hey, I've worked hard in life.

204
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:11,929
I'll subscribe.

205
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:13,722
-I told you I quit.
-Right.

206
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:18,060
You kids went through a lot yesterday,
so I wanted to treat you.

207
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,603
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you, sir.

208
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,271
How will you proceed from here?

209
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:23,357
We'll kill the big guy,

210
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:27,027
and we'll catch the wildcat-looking one
and make him talk.

211
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:30,155
That wildcat-looking bastard is
Kim Myeong-gil's cleanup guy.

212
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:35,077
If I had to guess, he's the one
that goes around buying people's silence.

213
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,205
Threatening them into submission
whenever Kim Myeong-gil causes trouble.

214
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:39,665
After we fuck him up

215
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:43,043
and find the body Kim Myeong-gil
made him bury, it's over.

216
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,170
No amount of money
can make a dead body go away.

217
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,256
I guess that would end Smile Capital.

218
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,340
That's right.

219
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:51,635
What do we look for
if we can't find the body?

220
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,138
If we find a murder weapon
or the right footage,

221
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,764
that would also end them.

222
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:58,600
Here.

223
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,937
As for the yellowtail,

224
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:04,231
the aging process--

225
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:05,941
I'm sorry.

226
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,569
-Sit.
-You sure took your time.

227
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,488
Hello, I'm Lee Du-yeong.
I've heard about you guys.

228
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,490
-I'm Kim Gun-woo, sir.
-Okay.

229
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:14,908
-I'm Hong Woo-jin, sir.
-Jeez.

230
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,494
Boxers' fists are built differently.
Nice to meet you.

231
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:20,748
I actually went
to the underground passage that day.

232
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:24,710
I went over right after the boss called,
but I live far away, so I was late.

233
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:27,379
But then I saw those goons
all lying on the ground

234
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:30,090
and thought,
"These kids are real fighters."

235
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,050
I see.

236
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:35,679
You also dreamed of becoming
a world champion back in the day, right?

237
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,848
Why are you dragging me into this?

238
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:38,766
Why not?

239
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,351
Can you go on a hit today?

240
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:45,355
-What?
-The sales director.

241
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,066
We'll talk when we're alone.

242
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,526
Why? They're coming with us.

243
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,820
What do you mean they're coming too?

244
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,740
-What's the issue?
-I don't want them to be accomplices.

245
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:59,286
They're the ones who wanted in.
Don't take it out on me.

246
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,665
Hey. Once you have a criminal record,

247
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,168
you can't return to the ring.
You know that, right?

248
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,003
Yes.

249
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,008
Why are you fighting Kim Myeong-gil?

250
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,344
I have to avenge our boys' deaths.

251
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:18,347
You could die fighting Kim Myeong-gil.

252
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,264
Aren't you afraid?

253
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:20,933
I'm not afraid of dying.

254
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,060
I'm afraid of not killing them.

255
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,730
What will you guys do?

256
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,690
-I'm going.
-Me too.

257
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:29,817
Why?

258
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,569
Kim Myeong-gil is a terrible man.

259
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,657
Our family would've been ruined
if it weren't for Mr. Choi.

260
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:39,618
The only thing I'm good at is fighting,

261
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,079
but I want to help until the very end.

262
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:43,872
Same here.

263
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,458
We, the Marine duo,
can be of great assistance.

264
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:47,918
You guys are Marines?

265
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:48,836
Yes, sir.

266
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:50,379
Are you a Marine, sir?

267
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,798
I was exempted, but he was a Marine.

268
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:54,758
Hey.

269
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:56,760
Salute!

270
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,264
Salute.

271
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:04,560
Why do you keep divulging
my personal information? Are you crazy?

272
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:07,187
This is how you get to know each other.

273
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:11,316
Put those hands down, you punks.

274
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,526
Tell us your class, sir!

275
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,194
I said put them down.

276
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,614
I wish to call you a senior Marine, sir!

277
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:22,119
Look at this punk, making me get up.
I said hands down, you fool!

278
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:26,331
Once a Marine, always a Marine, sir!

279
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:29,209
-Would you look at that?
-Go easy on him.

280
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:32,171
This punk is trying to one-up me.
Look at this guy.

281
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:35,090
No, sir. It's the Marine spirit
that's one-upping you.

282
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:38,177
Sir, he's a bit high on pride.

283
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,970
Please let him off the hook.

284
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:41,471
"High on pride"?

285
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:43,974
It means his MCP's a bit strong.

286
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:45,184
What's "MCP"?

287
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,811
-It's short for Marine Corps Pride.
-I see.

288
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,354
Please tell me your class, sir.

289
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,565
Yang-jung, he's high on MCP.

290
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:53,025
Please tell me, sir!

291
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:58,238
I'm class 571. Are you happy now?

292
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,158
Senior Marine.

293
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:03,118
Salute!

294
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,000
Are you going too?

295
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,337
Do you think I can't put up a fight?

296
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,381
The boss might worry.

297
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:18,217
That's why I asked.

298
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:22,596
I started this.
I'll see it through to the end.

299
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:24,431
Okay.

300
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:27,768
Okay.

301
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,437
We'll strike tonight.

302
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:33,273
Du-yeong, call me
once you get the sales director.

303
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:36,109
I'll wait in front of the hospital
and move in once you call.

304
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,069
Understood.

305
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,238
Why wait to go in?

306
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,406
If there are goons
with the sales director,

307
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,201
they've caught on.
That means they'll be at the hospital too.

308
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:47,746
Wouldn't it be dangerous
for Mr. Lee to go alone?

309
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,498
He'll be fine. He's fast.

310
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,834
Wouldn't it be safer

311
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,963
to gang up on Kim Jun-min together,
then go in and get Im Jang-do?

312
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,674
Once he knows that we're on the move,

313
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,968
Kim Myeong-gil will unleash
all of his goons.

314
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,511
Then we're dead.

315
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,388
The numbers aren't in our favor.

316
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:07,599
We have to split up
and hit them simultaneously.

317
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:09,559
It's dangerous,

318
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,645
but that's the only way we'll win.

319
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,692
I'm on a motorcycle, so I'll be fine.

320
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:19,069
I'll run if things get dicey.

321
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,115
What should we do?

322
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:25,701
Can you ride a motorcycle?

323
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:27,327
No.

324
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,288
A scooter is fast too.

325
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:30,706
What?

326
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:32,749
Nothing, sir.

327
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:37,004
I'll bring them with me.
I might need them at the hospital.

328
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:40,882
I'll go with Mr. Lee.
I can ride a motorcycle.

329
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:42,843
All right.

330
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:44,511
Now, shall we eat?

331
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:45,929
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

332
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,973
Hyeon-ju, you ride a motorcycle?

333
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:49,725
-Yes.
-What kind?

334
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:51,518
I ride a naked bike.

335
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:54,396
Don't you think we look a bit similar?

336
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:56,606
-Right?
-Yes.

337
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:58,483
Damn it.

338
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,235
Hey, no need to curse.

339
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,445
Where'd you serve, sir?

340
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:03,155
Let's not talk about the military.

341
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,032
You should stop.

342
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:08,702
Hey, Min-dong. Give us some soup and rice.

343
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:10,370
Yes, sir.

344
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,165
Duk.

345
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,792
-How have you been?
-Great. It's been a while, sir.

346
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:17,377
She'll be riding it.

347
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,545
-Hello.
-Hello.

348
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:20,797
I've prepared it over there.

349
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,593
The new ones are nice.

350
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:30,098
-Did you ever ride a racing model before?
-Briefly, a while back.

351
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:35,062
You were trained
on how to hold a knife in the army, right?

352
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:36,855
-Try holding this.
-No.

353
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:38,732
No?

354
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:39,900
-No.
-No.

355
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:44,946
Try holding it anyway.

356
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:48,575
Sir, we don't plan on using knives.

357
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:53,413
-Who told you to use a knife?
-Well, didn't you just offer us knives?

358
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:55,207
Are you talking back?

359
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,500
I'll do better, sir!

360
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:02,881
You have to know how to use a knife
in order to know how a knifer thinks.

361
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:04,925
You have to read their minds to beat them.

362
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:06,134
I see.

363
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:07,803
Jeez. That scared me.

364
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:12,224
Let's see. Once you get used to it…

365
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:15,685
This is the fastest one.

366
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,319
It suits you.

367
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:29,950
Sashimi knives don't have a guard
between the hilt and blade.

368
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:31,827
This blade isn't for stabbing.

369
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,871
Look. If you stab hard with this…

370
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:39,501
your hand slides forward,
and the blade will fuck up your fingers.

371
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,002
To stab deep with this,

372
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,796
you have to support the back.

373
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:44,297
That's how

374
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:46,675
your hands don't slip.

375
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:50,804
If someone's like this,
what are they aiming for?

376
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:53,390
They're trying to slash my hand or wrist.

377
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:56,101
Correct. It won't exactly cut deep.

378
00:23:56,685 --> 00:24:00,021
In boxing, it's like
when an out-boxer throws light jabs.

379
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,398
I see!

380
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:05,902
One more time!

381
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:06,820
It's fine.

382
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:09,906
Loosen up and keep circling around.

383
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,834
What if they're supporting
with both hands?

384
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:23,170
They're coming in for the kill, right?

385
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:28,175
Since you're pushing down with your thumb,

386
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:30,343
your hand won't slide easily.

387
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:34,139
If someone holds their knife like this,
they're experienced.

388
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:36,641
Swing with the same speed
you're coming in at.

389
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:37,851
-With less force.
-Lightly.

390
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:38,894
-Like this.
-Right.

391
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,153
That's it!

392
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,502
Play dirty, and I'll kill you.

393
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:06,087
What are you doing? Start dealing.

394
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,215
-Fuck. Let me have this.
-Hey, show me.

395
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:11,927
Where are your manners?

396
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,810
You fucking pricks!

397
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,372
Let's wait here.

398
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:06,690
Stop!

399
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:10,068
-Which unit are you visiting?
-Unit 603.

400
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,072
A car is coming in.

401
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:32,257
We have one.

402
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:33,717
What do we do?

403
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:36,469
Wait for now.

404
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,851
INCOMING CALL

405
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,394
Damn it.

406
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:07,042
Thank you, sir.

407
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,044
Listen while drinking.

408
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,129
In order to survive in this line of work,

409
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,340
you have to sell everything you've got.

410
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:15,550
Your fists.

411
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:16,509
Your soul.

412
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:17,844
Your dreams.

413
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:19,888
Sell it, and you'll live.

414
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:23,850
However, don't sell out
your friends and family.

415
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:25,852
It's better to die than to live like that.

416
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:28,271
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

417
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:31,566
When I go into the hospital

418
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,152
and tell you guys to run,
don't argue with me. Just run.

419
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:36,071
I'll take care of things inside.

420
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:40,075
Got it?

421
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:45,205
Didn't you just tell us
not to abandon our friends and family?

422
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:46,956
I'm a criminal.

423
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,418
We may be in the same boat right now,
but we're not family.

424
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,629
We'll never meet again
once this job's over.

425
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:55,757
So don't think about getting
emotionally attached. Got it?

426
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:02,639
Do you understand?

427
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:04,349
Yes, sir.

428
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:07,519
Yes, sir.

429
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:27,664
Kim Jun-min is here.

430
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:34,796
What are you going to do?

431
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:38,341
Mr. Lee, what do we do?

432
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:40,301
Can you hear me?

433
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:42,262
Please answer me.

434
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:43,805
I'm going in.

435
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,282
This motherfucker!

436
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:15,754
Call the hospital!

437
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:35,398
You son of a bitch! Motherfucker!

438
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,901
Die!

439
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:40,236
Motherfucker! You son of a bitch!

440
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,239
Fuck, you son of a bitch!

441
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:46,367
Do-hu.

442
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,953
Put this fucker in the trunk.

443
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:50,914
Hurry up and put him in!

444
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:55,293
What the hell?

445
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,214
-What the hell!
-That son of a bitch!

446
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:06,971
-Son of a bitch.
-Hey!

447
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:22,821
Are you all right?

448
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:42,632
MAIN BUILDING
PATIENT ROOM, BLOCK 17

449
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:44,843
DU-YEONG

450
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:47,637
Yes.

451
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:50,974
Are you all right?

452
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,059
Okay.

453
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:03,403
Let's go.

454
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:05,280
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

455
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:41,232
It's Im Jang-do.

456
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:48,573
BITCOIN

457
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:50,408
That's right, up you go.

458
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:55,538
Damn it!

459
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,675
Come on! Let's go!

460
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,052
Fuck!

461
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:24,275
All right. Wait.

462
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:26,861
Just a second.

463
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:28,655
Let me go. Damn it!

464
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:33,201
Damn it.

465
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:37,997
Who the fuck are you?

466
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:09,237
-Let's go.
-Yes, sir.

467
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:16,202
Be careful.

468
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:41,394
WE'VE GOT IM JANG-DO
TAKING HIM TO DU-YEONG'S STORE

469
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:01,372
-You're here.
-Hello, sir.

470
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:10,840
Can you put him here?

471
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:11,841
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

472
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,261
One, two…

473
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:16,345
Be careful.

474
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:18,097
Jeez.

475
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:20,600
Where's the salt?

476
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:21,517
Salt?

477
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:24,062
It's in the office.

478
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:26,397
Go make some salt water.

479
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,567
Find a bucket and pour in all the salt.

480
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:30,777
Yes, sir.

481
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,944
-Let's go.
-Okay.

482
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:32,987
It's by the corner.

483
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:33,988
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

484
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:36,532
Damn it.

485
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:45,083
Hyeon-ju, are you all right?

486
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,918
Yes. Are you all right?

487
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:47,960
Yes.

488
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,672
We've got Im Jang-do.

489
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:53,466
-Right.
-And Kim Jun-min?

490
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:56,344
Well, I was outside so I couldn't see,
but he said he got him.

491
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:59,472
-I see.
-Did he kill him by chance?

492
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:07,230
Let's hurry and make salt water.

493
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:08,731
-Go find it.
-Right.

494
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,445
I think we can use this.

495
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:16,030
-And water?
-I saw it downstairs.

496
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:16,948
Let's head down.

497
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:18,157
Hyeon-ju, let's go.

498
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:33,756
Yes, sir.

499
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,676
I'll be arriving in five minutes,
so shake him up a bit.

500
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:38,010
Also,

501
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:41,180
have Hyeon-ju and the other kids watch.

502
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:56,362
What is it?

503
00:35:58,197 --> 00:35:59,824
He wants Hyeon-ju to watch.

504
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:00,867
Why?

505
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:05,413
Man. Will Hyeon-ju be all right?

506
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:09,167
Hello, sir. Right this way.

507
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:26,184
Let's see the stairs.

508
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:27,894
We don't have cameras on that side.

509
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:29,353
Why not?

510
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:30,771
We just don't.

511
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:34,817
Are you fucking kidding me?

512
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:40,281
Well, are there any cameras outside
facing the building?

513
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,783
You'll have to go to the police for that.

514
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:52,376
How's Jun-min?

515
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:55,588
He's unconscious, sir.

516
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:58,299
Go to the apartment manager,

517
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,343
and find the bastards that got Jun-min.

518
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:01,677
Yes, sir.

519
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:05,139
-Let's put it here.
-I'll pour it in.

520
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,349
How much do we pour?

521
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:09,018
Didn't he tell us to pour in everything?

522
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:10,228
Isn't this too much?

523
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:13,481
Let's pour in everything.
You answered him.

524
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:15,441
All right.

525
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:19,612
What are you doing?

526
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:21,155
They told us to make salt water.

527
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:27,870
Right, salt water.

528
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:29,080
Yes, sir.

529
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:34,502
Come here and watch.

530
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,004
Why?

531
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,673
It's Mr. Choi's orders.

532
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:50,184
I hate when people open their mouths
and then close them again.

533
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:55,773
So when you find the resolve
to tell me everything, nod your head.

534
00:37:57,275 --> 00:38:01,028
If you say you'll talk and then back down,
I'll carve your lips off with a knife.

535
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:02,446
Got it?

536
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:42,236
You're not going to talk, are you?

537
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,721
Hyeon-ju.

538
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:06,695
Why did you tell me to watch that?

539
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:10,616
Myeong-gil probably started looking
for Im Jang-do by now.

540
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:12,660
We don't have much time.

541
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:16,288
There's something
I want to teach you guys.

542
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:18,499
What are you talking about?

543
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:21,252
This won't end until someone dies.

544
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:23,754
And there's no guarantee
that I'll make it out alive.

545
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:27,174
Then win. Why are you so fixated
on the worst outcome?

546
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,343
-Hyeon-ju.
-That's enough.

547
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:36,100
Hyeon-ju!

548
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:41,105
Mr. Oh, please go after Hyeon-ju.

549
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:42,189
Yes, sir.

550
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:45,109
Jeez. That kid, seriously.

551
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:50,906
-Gun-woo.
-Yes, sir.

552
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:53,701
If…

553
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:57,163
Myeong-gil and you guys

554
00:40:58,164 --> 00:41:00,166
end up fighting,

555
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,127
can you protect the others?

556
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:06,422
I'll protect them to the end.

557
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:08,924
Okay, thank you.

558
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:14,638
We don't have much time,
so let me teach you just one thing.

559
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:22,354
You need two things
to beat a tight-knit organization.

560
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:26,650
Dispersion and division.

561
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:31,030
People tend to trust those
that know them well

562
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:32,490
and empathize with them.

563
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:36,827
Without gaining an individual's trust,

564
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:40,331
you can't hope to divide an organization.

565
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:56,305
Take it off.

566
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:14,073
Im Jang-do?

567
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:17,660
I believe that you,
of all Myeong-gil's men,

568
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:20,788
have the best understanding of the man.

569
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:24,917
Myeong-gil is a very violent
and cruel man.

570
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,586
But he's capable
of reading people like a book.

571
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:30,256
He also knows how to win them over.

572
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:35,219
So Kim Jun-min and Kang In-beom
probably believe in him in earnest.

573
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:37,346
But you're a smart man.

574
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:39,723
You know Myeong-gil better than them.

575
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:43,102
Myeong-gil never truly empathizes
with anything

576
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:44,812
from the bottom of his heart.

577
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:47,106
He empathizes coldly with his head.

578
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:52,236
He's always calculating
how to manipulate people to his advantage.

579
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:55,781
Yet knowing this,
you still went to work for him.

580
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:57,449
Why?

581
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,494
The first reason was money.

582
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,415
Myeong-gil paid you in a year
what a major corporation

583
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:06,625
would have paid you
for five years of work.

584
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:10,087
Graduating from Police University
was your ticket to authority,

585
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:12,673
but you were demoted.
Making money was your only option.

586
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:15,092
That's how you'd save your pride.

587
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:21,390
But the second reason is why
you really decided to work for Myeong-gil.

588
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:25,185
You were confident
you wouldn't let Myeong-gil use you.

589
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:29,815
You were certain you wouldn't lose
to a criminal bastard like him.

590
00:43:30,816 --> 00:43:33,652
And if Myeong-gil ever found
a reason to kill you,

591
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:37,156
all you had to do was hightail it
to Southeast Asia

592
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,200
with the money you made
working for Myeong-gil.

593
00:43:43,495 --> 00:43:45,289
I really like your plan.

594
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:50,586
But if I were to take your photo now
and send it to Myeong-gil,

595
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:55,466
telling him that you ratted out
the people Myeong-gil had you kill,

596
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:57,259
he'd trust me without a doubt

597
00:43:57,343 --> 00:44:01,597
because your current state
is motive enough for you to squeal.

598
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:08,312
Then Myeong-gil will call back
the men he sent out to find you

599
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:12,733
and unleash a pack of bloodhounds
to kill and dispose of you discretely.

600
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:17,363
Those guys won't give you time
to plead your case to Myeong-gil

601
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:18,989
because he told them not to.

602
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:21,492
Myeong-gil isn't interested in the truth.

603
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:24,536
It's safest to bury you six feet under.

604
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:29,291
I mean, the person who knows
Myeong-gil's crimes best

605
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:32,211
isn't Kim Jun-min
or Kang In-beom. It's you.

606
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:38,967
You know Myeong-gil as well as I do.

607
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:45,140
If I were to plant even the smallest seed
of doubt in his mind about you…

608
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:49,353
Myeong-gil would kill you.

609
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:50,854
Fuck.

610
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:53,982
Wait.

611
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:56,527
Why should I die?

612
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,446
Fuck!

613
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:00,406
Im Jang-do!

614
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:03,826
Listen to me carefully!

615
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:06,537
If you don't pull yourself together now,
you'll really die!

616
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:13,085
Tell me everything you know.

617
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:17,506
In exchange, I'll send you off
to a safe country

618
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:19,550
with enough money
for the rest of your life.

619
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,428
Myeong-gil learned everything from me.

620
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:26,432
I know of places he hasn't even heard of.

621
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:28,142
I promise.

622
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:35,107
You were going to make an exit anyway.

623
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:38,110
Now is your chance.

624
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:44,783
If I tell you,

625
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:47,828
how much will you give me?

626
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:52,750
Answer quickly and sincerely.

627
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:03,135
I'm going to end
Myeong-gil and Smile Capital for good.

628
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:05,721
After that, I'll send you to Guam.

629
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:07,389
I know some people there.

630
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:11,810
I'll give you all the backing you need
to start a new life there.

631
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:21,528
Get him some clothes.

632
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:38,378
How long have you worked for Myeong-gil?

633
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:40,506
Five years.

634
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:42,341
What exactly do you do?

635
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:46,595
I make sure Mr. Kim's illegal dealings
fly under the police radar,

636
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:50,182
keeping them from blowing up
if the police start investigating.

637
00:46:50,265 --> 00:46:51,809
And your personal contributions?

638
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:54,353
For small cases,
In-beom and I'd go to take care of it,

639
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:57,523
but for most cases,
we used Mr. Kim's service company.

640
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,399
"Small cases"?

641
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:00,317
Like…

642
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:03,987
Things like filming dirt to use on others.

643
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:06,406
You threatened Iil Group, didn't you?

644
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:10,244
What did you do?

645
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:12,913
Mr. Kim made me do it.

646
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:15,707
He didn't ask you who.
He asked you what you did.

647
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:19,711
I got footage of Iil Group's heir.

648
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:20,921
What kind?

649
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:23,173
We stripped him down

650
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:25,342
and took videos.

651
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:26,260
Why?

652
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:31,056
Fill me in from the start.

653
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:35,686
There's a 40-story posh hotel
being constructed in Gangnam.

654
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:38,647
But after COVID-19 hit,
the company in charge went bankrupt.

655
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,567
The Iil Group heir planned to take over,

656
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:43,944
but Mr. Kim heard
they were 100 billion short.

657
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:45,279
From who?

658
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:47,906
The building was discarded for so long,

659
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:49,491
Seoul City stepped in.

660
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:51,535
They were looking for someone with cash,

661
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:53,871
and an assemblyman
who plays golf with Mr. Kim

662
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:56,456
recommended him to the mayor.

663
00:47:57,124 --> 00:48:01,169
Mr. Kim dreams
of building a casino in a hotel.

664
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:06,383
Seoul City said they'd grant him
a permit for a foreigner-only casino,

665
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,343
so Mr. Kim got excited.

666
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:10,554
But the Iil Group heir tried to back out,

667
00:48:10,637 --> 00:48:13,056
so Mr. Kim made me get him to cooperate.

668
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:16,184
How many people did you take videos of?

669
00:48:16,935 --> 00:48:17,769
Fifty.

670
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:21,481
Is Myeong-gil holding on to these videos?

671
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:22,399
Yes.

672
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:25,819
He sees every weakness
as a source of income.

673
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:27,779
Also,

674
00:48:28,363 --> 00:48:30,908
he never shares anything
that's worth any money.

675
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:33,368
Where is this data?

676
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:38,373
Mr. Kim keeps a hard drive
in a small safe inside his bedroom,

677
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:41,001
but the safe is a German smart safe.

678
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:44,087
It only opens by putting the vein
in his right arm against it.

679
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:47,090
Should any issues arise, he can incinerate

680
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:49,343
all of its contents remotely
using his phone.

681
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:51,845
The top of the safe holds liquid fuel

682
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:54,723
that will drop down
and ignite at the press of a button.

683
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:57,309
He knows that the hard drive is
a double-edged sword.

684
00:48:57,392 --> 00:49:01,229
It's a weapon to him
but evidence to the police.

685
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:05,442
That service company is a gang?

686
00:49:05,984 --> 00:49:06,818
Yes.

687
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:08,195
How many men?

688
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:12,157
I believe about 30,
but they call more if needed.

689
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,325
Who's in charge?

690
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:17,579
Mr. Jung, the president.
He's Mr. Kim's butcher.

691
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:19,539
He used to be an MMA fighter,

692
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:22,709
but he got banned for beating
a fighter to death during a match.

693
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:24,670
I heard Mr. Kim recruited him.

694
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:26,380
How do they get rid of the bodies?

695
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:28,966
Mr. Jung takes care of the bodies.

696
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:31,134
Yes, tell me what you know.

697
00:49:32,594 --> 00:49:36,682
About three years ago,
Mr. Kim saw red while drinking

698
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:38,183
and beat a person to death.

699
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:40,894
I happened to be nearby at the time,

700
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:43,730
so I took care of things
until Mr. Jung got there.

701
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:47,067
Mr. Jung called over a 3-ton fish truck
with an aquarium attached

702
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:48,443
and carried the body away.

703
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:52,155
From the way he was talking to the driver,
Mr. Jung seemed to be a regular.

704
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:53,907
Do you have a name?

705
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:57,160
It's been too long to remember.

706
00:49:59,121 --> 00:49:59,955
I see.

707
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:02,416
I know a hospital in Incheon.

708
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:05,252
I'll call over their ambulance,
so get some rest.

709
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:08,422
Once the job's done
and everything's taken care of,

710
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:10,924
I'll arrange a passport
and flight for you.

711
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:16,930
Don't contact anyone.

712
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:19,975
Otherwise, Kim Myeong-gil will find you.

713
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:26,690
I'm taking your phone.

714
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:35,782
Let me ask one last thing.

715
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:39,870
Where's Myeong-gil's stash of gold?

716
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,248
Only In-beom knows about that.

717
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:45,834
What's their relationship?

718
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:48,462
In-beom is the only person Mr. Kim trusts.

719
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:51,089
They met in prison.

720
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:53,425
I heard they saved
each other's lives many times.

721
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:55,802
In-beom is willing to die for him.

722
00:50:56,928 --> 00:50:58,889
I don't know all of Mr. Kim's thoughts,

723
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:01,933
but he thinks of In-beom
as his brother. I'm sure.
