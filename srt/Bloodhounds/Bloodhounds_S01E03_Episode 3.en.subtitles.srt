1
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:22,397
What the hell?

2
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:26,359
Who the fuck are you?

3
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:38,496
Come on, you son of a bitch.

4
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:39,998
You bastard!

5
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,461
Fuck.

6
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:46,463
Let's go.

7
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,471
Woo-jin. Let's call an ambulance.

8
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:57,015
Gun-woo, things could get serious.

9
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:58,808
A man is dying.

10
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:16,826
Hyeon-ju.

11
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,995
An old homeless man was injured badly,

12
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,164
so we called an ambulance.

13
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,624
What about Yang Jae-myeong?

14
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:24,459
He ran away.

15
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:26,503
Fuck! I told you not to interfere!

16
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,379
But he was badly hurt.

17
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:29,756
We had no choice.

18
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:32,008
You don't even know him.
Why did you interfere?

19
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,010
Yes, but--

20
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:40,141
What do we do?

21
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:46,397
I'll give her a call.

22
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:56,282
-What?
-Hyeon-ju. About this…

23
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,201
We are really sorry.

24
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,161
This was 100% our fault.

25
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:03,039
Where are you?
I want to go apologize in person.

26
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,375
Forget it. It's over.

27
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:08,128
Hyeon-ju, just give us
five minutes of your time, please?

28
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:11,047
I am not kidding around at all.

29
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,008
I'm really sorry about this.
Gun-woo also wants to apologize.

30
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,761
Please, give us five minutes.

31
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:18,179
Please.

32
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,348
Come to the bookstore.

33
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:33,444
Woo-jin.

34
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,323
To be honest, I don't get it.

35
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:38,616
What? Get what?

36
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,745
If we had done nothing,
that homeless old man could've died.

37
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:43,746
You saw it yourself.

38
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,165
I did.

39
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:48,293
We did the right thing,
so why do you have to apologize like that?

40
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:52,213
-Why do we have to apologize?
-This was our first time on the job.

41
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:55,341
Hyeon-ju wasn't here,
so it's hard for her to understand.

42
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:59,137
We still don't know each other well,
and this happened.

43
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,307
If we apologize for things
that might cause misunderstandings,

44
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:04,642
I think we'll be able to communicate.

45
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,605
-But…
-Gun-woo.

46
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,733
I don't think you did anything wrong.

47
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:13,484
But for the sake of the job,

48
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,655
we should be able to smooth this out
if we help each other a bit.

49
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:20,325
Just this once, okay?

50
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,162
Yes, okay.

51
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:52,315
BLOODHOUNDS

52
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,700
Don't sit. This will be quick.

53
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:05,161
Did you fight Yang Jae-myeong?

54
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,872
It was unavoidable.

55
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,624
We can't work together.

56
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,169
What?

57
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,796
Isn't it obvious?

58
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,881
We gave you a sincere apology.

59
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,217
I don't need an apology!

60
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:23,179
Yang Jae-myeong saw your faces, didn't he?

61
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:27,350
My plan was to tail him
and gather evidence quietly.

62
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:30,561
Now that Yang Jae-myeong knows
someone is on his tail, he'll lie low.

63
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:33,398
Therefore, my plan is ruined.

64
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:35,858
We wore caps and masks.
He couldn't have seen our faces.

65
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:39,487
Right. Since you covered your face,
there's no way he'd recognize you.

66
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:42,156
Since this shitty hair was covered,
he wouldn't recognize you!

67
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,617
Fuck! I'd recognize you from a mile away!

68
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:47,870
What are you doing? Get out.

69
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,081
-We apologized.
-I said get out!

70
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:51,708
-We had no choice.
-How so?

71
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,251
It's our first time working together.

72
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,086
-We're not perfect!
-That's why I refused you!

73
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,212
We acted accordingly!

74
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,797
-According to what?
-I told you earlier!

75
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,090
You don't fucking get it!

76
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:00,842
Why did you bring up my hair?

77
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,093
-We'll leave.
-Fuck.

78
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:03,845
So stop screaming, please.

79
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,931
I'll find a way to return

80
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,727
the money Mr. Choi gave me.

81
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:17,358
Since Woo-jin and I listened
to your yelling,

82
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,986
please listen to me too.

83
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:29,203
If someone offered
to make your work go smoothly

84
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:32,332
in exchange for killing someone,

85
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,500
could you do it?

86
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:50,266
The Smile Capital boss
cut my face with a knife.

87
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:54,395
If I had done nothing
while a man was dying in front of me,

88
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,523
I'd be worse than that guy.

89
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,735
It would be wrong.

90
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:04,697
Think about it.

91
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:43,111
I'll find some other place.
Don't worry too much.

92
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,739
I'm sorry. I couldn't hold back.

93
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,492
You held back better than I did.

94
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:53,704
Are you hungry? Let's go
to this hangover soup place I know.

95
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:56,749
Wait a second.

96
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,628
It's probably closed
because of COVID. It's past ten.

97
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:05,216
That just made me more hungry.

98
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,926
I forgot.

99
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,305
My stomach hurts.

100
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,226
It's not my fault they're closed
because of COVID.

101
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,062
It's your fault for bringing it up.

102
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,316
You couldn't hold yourself back
with Hyeon-ju just now!

103
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,235
You said that I did a good job.

104
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:26,654
I said that
because you were moping like a loser.

105
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,448
I wasn't moping like a loser.

106
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:32,785
"I wasn't moping like a loser."

107
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:34,912
What are you doing?

108
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:37,999
I'm imitating you, you loser.
"Man, I'm hungry."

109
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:40,084
-"My stomach hurts."
-Wow.

110
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,086
You're so ugly.

111
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:45,882
How could you joke like that?

112
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,509
What? I wasn't joking. I'm being serious.

113
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,555
I'm seriously hurt by this, so apologize.

114
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:01,272
SORRY, I WAS WRONG. SEE YOU AT THE OFFICE
TOMORROW AT 10:00 A.M.

115
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:03,065
Woo-jin.

116
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:08,362
I knew we'd get through to her!

117
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:54,492
Hey, it's short!

118
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:55,409
-Short.
-Short!

119
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,453
You're so damn loud!

120
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,373
Don't get mad. It's just a game.

121
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:01,707
-That's expensive.
-Why so mad?

122
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,126
-Hurry up and go.
-God, I will!

123
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,044
It's your turn.

124
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:07,588
YANG JAE-MYEONG
I'M WAITING IN FRONT OF THE GOLF SHOP

125
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,799
-You have to wear your mask, sir.
-Got it.

126
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,096
What is it?

127
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,057
Someone is tailing us, sir.

128
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:20,601
Who was it?

129
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,896
They were young,
but they knew how to fight.

130
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:25,731
Are you sure?

131
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:28,818
-What?
-Are you sure someone's tailing you?

132
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:31,487
Focus.

133
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,572
The thing is…

134
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:34,615
Talk.

135
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,659
Before I started working for you,

136
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,828
I borrowed some money from a place.

137
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,289
They didn't mention wanting it back,
so I ignored the fuckers.

138
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,248
Get to the point.

139
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:44,166
But they came for the money recently.

140
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,128
The bastard that came to collect
was wearing a hat with a red cat on it.

141
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:50,840
The punk who got the jump on us today
was wearing the same hat.

142
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,011
Not a coincidence?

143
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,306
No. It was the same cap, sir.

144
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,228
Where did you borrow the money?

145
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,814
To explain yesterday's situation briefly,

146
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:09,275
Yang Jae-myeong had already robbed
that homeless man,

147
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,736
but he had forgotten about that.

148
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:14,363
So it resulted in a fight
when he started a conversation.

149
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:18,034
But how much money

150
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,870
do Jae-myeong's guys borrow
with one stolen ID?

151
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:23,706
About 50 million won per mule account.

152
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,167
That's 500 million for ten stolen IDs.

153
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,419
Jeez. How long have they been doing this?

154
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,756
At least for half a year, I think.

155
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,051
Wow! They must have made quite a fortune.

156
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:39,180
Did those loan sharks
just sit back and do nothing?

157
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:41,724
They'll be investigated by the cops
if they report it.

158
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:45,019
They're trying to recover the money
on their own but aren't able to.

159
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,522
This is my plan.

160
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:51,192
Find the private loan sharks
that Yang Jae-myeong conned

161
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:54,070
and recover the money
Yang Jae-myeong stole for a commission.

162
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,157
With a 1% commission,
that's three billion won.

163
00:10:58,908 --> 00:10:59,950
We should charge 2%.

164
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:07,208
Woo-jin.

165
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,336
If loan sharks get conned,

166
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:13,631
wouldn't that make things worse
for the people who got loans from them?

167
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,341
What?

168
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:18,427
They'd have to harass their clients more
to recoup their losses.

169
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:19,887
So?

170
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:24,392
I just thought small businesses
would suffer the most.

171
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:26,977
You're right about that.

172
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:27,895
Yes.

173
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,076
How did they find us?

174
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,370
How did they find us?

175
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:45,287
I don't know.

176
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,668
Turn off the lights and the sign outside.

177
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:51,877
Damn it!

178
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,758
PYEONGHWA BOOKS

179
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:00,803
-Turn your phones off.
-Okay.

180
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:09,437
Is it here? Are you sure?

181
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,438
Yes. I'm sure, sir.

182
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,698
You borrowed money from a bookstore?

183
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:24,577
Yes. The owner used to be
a big moneylender back in the day.

184
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,929
Hey, give this a kick.

185
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:54,940
Kick here.

186
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,944
Hurry up, you bastard.

187
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,870
-Kick harder.
-What?

188
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,580
Kick harder, you bastard!

189
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:10,706
Damn it.

190
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,292
Harder!

191
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:15,211
Harder!

192
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,296
Kick harder, you bastard!

193
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:22,593
That's enough.

194
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:26,180
We'll need heavy equipment
to tear this down.

195
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,351
This here is the safe.

196
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,894
Last night on your way back,
did you check if you were being tailed?

197
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:17,314
Well, we took the bus.

198
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:19,984
They could have followed the bus.

199
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:24,947
If they had tailed us last night,
why didn't they jump us right away?

200
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,615
Why make their move now?

201
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,077
-He might've wanted to bring Kim Jun-min--
-Hyeon-ju.

202
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,371
Yang Jae-myeong saw
how we fought last night.

203
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:35,124
If he wanted to jump us,
he would've brought more people.

204
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,919
They probably weren't sure either.

205
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:42,506
But they might have caught on now.

206
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,472
Anyway, it's important to find out
how those people found us.

207
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,017
That's how we'll prevent
making the same mistake twice.

208
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,643
Okay. I totally understand.

209
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:58,230
Why don't we sit down for a chat? Yes?

210
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,365
Does Yang Jae-myeong know of this place?

211
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,492
He came here a long time ago.

212
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:16,081
That means he's caught onto
our connection with this place somehow.

213
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:17,958
Right.

214
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:21,545
Yes.

215
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:26,759
Well…

216
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,137
He could've recognized your cap, right?

217
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,766
The thing is,

218
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:37,603
I followed you a while back
when you were chasing down a homeless man.

219
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:38,771
Oh…

220
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,524
Yes, that was me.

221
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,778
The homeless man back then
was Yang Jae-myeong.

222
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:47,863
I see. Crap.

223
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:51,408
I was wearing
that cap back then, wasn't I?

224
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:54,745
Yes. Your hat left quite the impression.

225
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,499
Then that might've been
how they found out.

226
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:01,961
But why do you think
they kicked the shutters?

227
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:05,923
Our shutters were custom-made
with steel, not aluminum.

228
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:07,341
They were checking for that.

229
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:09,843
Damn, I think they'll be back.

230
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,263
Why is he here?

231
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,949
What were you guys doing?

232
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,077
That white car came here, didn't it?

233
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,205
Speak up.

234
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,752
I am sorry, sir. It's my fault.

235
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:47,798
We went out on a job last night.

236
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:49,049
What kind of job?

237
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,176
The thing is…

238
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:54,471
What kind of job?

239
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,100
We were tailing Yang Jae-myeong.

240
00:16:59,018 --> 00:16:59,852
Why?

241
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:02,855
Grandpa, loan sharks are desperate
to catch Yang Jae-myeong.

242
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:05,399
I'm sure they'll be willing to pay for it.

243
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:08,235
And I happen to be
the only one who can catch him.

244
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:10,487
Is this about money?

245
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,322
It's good to make money.

246
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:15,451
What did you guys do?

247
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:19,121
They are my bodyguards, aren't they?

248
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,041
I'm not hurt.

249
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,293
I'm disappointed in you.

250
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,255
I'm disappointed in you too, Grandpa.

251
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:30,466
It's clear Yang Jae-myeong is
up to no good.

252
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,925
Why aren't you doing anything?

253
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:35,471
Mr. Hwang could get rid of him
with a snap of his finger!

254
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:38,640
Are you frustrated?
I'm even more frustrated!

255
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,603
Gun-woo, take off that bandage.

256
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,438
-What?
-Hurry up and do it.

257
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:47,024
What? Okay.

258
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,489
If Yang Jae-myeong and Kim Jun-min
keep conning loan sharks,

259
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,200
they'll inevitably threaten
and tighten their grip

260
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:58,702
on powerless people like Gun-woo.

261
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:03,123
That would effectively render
all the charity work you do meaningless.

262
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:06,085
Your money will go straight
into their pockets!

263
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,338
If you really want to help those in need,

264
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,549
you should weed out the punks
like Yang Jae-myeong first.

265
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:16,095
Who did that to your face?

266
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,557
The Smile Capital boss did it, sir.

267
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:22,935
What's his name?

268
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:26,188
Well, I don't know his name.

269
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:30,400
He had a long knife scar
running down his left cheek.

270
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:39,993
Go back home.

271
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:58,554
Sir.

272
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,598
Could it just be a coincidence?

273
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:05,477
Please check if Kim Myeong-gil is
the CEO of Smile Capital.

274
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:06,812
Yes, sir.

275
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:16,238
Juju.

276
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:18,365
What?

277
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,617
You called us your bodyguards.

278
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:23,287
I have to say, that felt good.

279
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,371
So?

280
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:27,916
So I thought it might be nice
to talk casually.

281
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,002
We are a team, after all, Juju.

282
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:32,629
So, we're not a team
if we don't speak casually?

283
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:36,717
It's a suggestion because it'd be nice
if we could work as one big happy family.

284
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:40,971
If we're a family, the oldest
should treat the rest to a meal.

285
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:42,097
Are you buying?

286
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:45,017
I prefer sticking
to the formalities, ma'am.

287
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:46,768
I'm kidding.

288
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,104
Let's use Grandpa's credit card.
What do you want?

289
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,022
Rib eye.

290
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:51,565
Then you pay.

291
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:54,276
A barbecue buffet.

292
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:57,446
-A barbecue buffet?
-Yes. I know a great place.

293
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,576
Well, all right.

294
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:03,493
Let's go!

295
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,999
How long have you been friends
with Gun-woo?

296
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:13,253
I don't think it matters
how long you've known a person.

297
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:16,089
Knowing someone a long time
doesn't mean you're real friends.

298
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,007
So?

299
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,800
What really matters is

300
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,762
how similar your life trajectories are.

301
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:25,849
To be able to understand one another,
even after a short conversation.

302
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,392
That's important.

303
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,645
-And that's you two?
-Right.

304
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:34,399
Besides, boxers like us exchange more than
just our fists in an exchange of blows.

305
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:36,985
"So that's the kind of life you've lived."

306
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:37,903
Pow!

307
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:39,529
"This is how I've lived."

308
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:42,783
Each blow contains

309
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:47,913
the fighters' character,
heart, experience, hysteria…

310
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,123
History?

311
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:51,917
History.

312
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,879
We see it all. We know it all.

313
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:57,589
Sure.

314
00:20:58,173 --> 00:20:59,549
Besides, Gun-woo is

315
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:03,053
a senior Marine.

316
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:06,014
And that tells you everything.

317
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,225
What exactly does it tell you?

318
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:11,144
Everything.

319
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:12,437
Everything about what?

320
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:15,565
Juju, this isn't something
that can be explained.

321
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,317
It's just a Marine thing.

322
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:20,195
It's like when rappers use hip-hop
as an all-encompassing term

323
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:23,657
when they look at something
and go, "This is hip-hop."

324
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,284
It's indescribable.

325
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,911
I see. Indescribable, you say?

326
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,998
-Are you mocking me?
-Of course not.

327
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,416
This stuff is really…

328
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:33,625
-Here.
-Right.

329
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:38,672
What?

330
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:41,925
You haven't even turned on the grill yet?

331
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,176
You never told me to.

332
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,971
It's customary for whoever is
at the table to turn on the grill.

333
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:48,348
I didn't know.
Why didn't you turn it on and go?

334
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:51,518
How could I? The grill would've burned
by the time I came back.

335
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:53,312
How would iron burn up?

336
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,105
It's not the iron that burns.

337
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:58,942
I'm saying that the meat will burn
if the grill is too hot.

338
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,152
So the meat will burn.

339
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:02,446
That's what "burning the grill" is.

340
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:05,949
That's what professional grillers say.
I'm just a civilian.

341
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,743
My mom says "burning the grill" too.

342
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,286
Well, my mom doesn't.

343
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:12,205
-For someone who knows meat--
-There!

344
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:13,707
Get grilling.

345
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,167
Well, I can't.

346
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,544
You can't put meat on a lukewarm grill.

347
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:19,838
Yes, that'll ruin the flavor.
You've got to wait.

348
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,177
Shall we talk while the grill heats up?

349
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:29,514
Gun-woo. Just speak naturally.

350
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,391
Right. Are you and Mr. Choi related?

351
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:34,603
What? That came out of left field.

352
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:37,898
I was actually curious about that too.

353
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:40,650
Well…

354
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:43,487
Long story short.

355
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:48,533
I was diagnosed with spinal cancer
when I was eight.

356
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:52,037
I was cured by the time I was ten,

357
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:56,083
but my dad passed away.

358
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:00,128
So I was sent to an orphanage,

359
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:03,173
but I hated it so much I ran away.

360
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,093
I used to get so hungry,

361
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:10,722
I ate leftover black bean sauce noodles
that people left on their doorsteps.

362
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,725
I also worked at bars
with other runaway kids,

363
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,186
but that was so hard.

364
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,940
So I went back to the orphanage.

365
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:25,570
I was dragged off to a different orphanage
when I was 17.

366
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:28,365
Grandpa was the owner there.

367
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:30,325
-Mr. Choi?
-Yes.

368
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:33,829
He built an orphanage
to do something meaningful.

369
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:38,166
He was really nice to me in particular.

370
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:41,211
At first, I thought he might be a pervert,

371
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,840
but I realized as time passed…

372
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,093
he was just being himself.

373
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:52,264
Grandpa let me learn everything I couldn't
because I didn't have the money.

374
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:56,101
I learned Kendo
and how to ride a motorcycle.

375
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:04,776
I can tell Mr. Choi is a nice person.

376
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:06,778
Since middle school,

377
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:09,489
I've worked part-time jobs with my mom
to pay off my dad's debt.

378
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:14,411
When our debt grew to 100 million won,
I felt utterly helpless.

379
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:18,206
I know how scary
a hundred million won can be.

380
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:21,877
So when Mr. Choi gave me that money,
telling me to pay off my debts,

381
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,211
I thought to myself

382
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,923
that I need to protect this man
at all costs.

383
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:32,762
Grandpa told me that in order
to judge someone's depth of character,

384
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:34,431
I should open up my mind.

385
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:38,143
People with depth of character will see
your earnestness and return it in kind,

386
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:41,354
and those who lack depth
will use that against you.

387
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:44,733
-That's true.
-You're a nice person, Gun-woo.

388
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:49,154
Right. I'm good at being nice
and being diligent.

389
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:51,656
-I think we can start grilling now.
-Sure.

390
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:03,168
Talk about perfect timing.

391
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:04,127
You're learning.

392
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:06,338
I learned from the best, right?

393
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:09,424
I suddenly feel left out.

394
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:12,719
Never mind. Hurry up and flip it.

395
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:13,720
I can't do that.

396
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:15,180
Trust him. He's good at this.

397
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:17,933
God, I can't get used to
this conversation.

398
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,142
Okay, take your time.

399
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:22,812
Smells amazing.

400
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,442
-Let's clean out the buffet today.
-Sure.

401
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,195
-When do you get the stitches out?
-Tomorrow.

402
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:31,279
Does it hurt?

403
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,572
Well, it's bearable.

404
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:37,118
-I asked for mine hot.
-It's better cold in the winter.

405
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,912
Jeez, seriously.

406
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:40,705
-Hyeon-ju.
-Yes.

407
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:44,167
Yang Jae-myeong knows our location.
Shouldn't we do something about it?

408
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,963
I'll talk it over with Grandpa.

409
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:51,716
-Ask quickly. We don't have time.
-Okay.

410
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:54,511
Ms. Lee.

411
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:57,055
The lobby is a hotel's first impression.

412
00:25:57,556 --> 00:26:00,809
I want our international guests
to see the most Korean, beautiful,

413
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:02,352
and majestic lobby there is.

414
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:05,397
The kind of thing
they've never experienced before.

415
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,690
Yes, I understand.

416
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:07,816
TEAM LEADER LEE SO-HYEON

417
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:10,569
I look forward to hearing
your brilliant ideas

418
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:11,653
at the meeting tomorrow.

419
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:15,782
Our casino will be
on the top floor of that hotel.

420
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:19,119
My goal is 100 billion won
in annual revenue.

421
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:20,829
There are a lot of people

422
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:24,207
itching for a fix now that
gambling in Macau's been blocked off.

423
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:29,254
We'll book them a suite
every week to let them have fun.

424
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:32,674
We'll secretly catch them
gambling on camera.

425
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:35,468
Once we have enough cash,

426
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:41,850
Jang-do will hand over the evidence
of illegal gambling to the police.

427
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:46,104
When the hotel is ruined
and worth nothing,

428
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:50,191
we'll swoop in
and take over the whole thing.

429
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:01,161
Once Jang-do returns
with dirt on Director Hong,

430
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:03,246
we need to be ready to spend 100 billion.

431
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:06,082
We're currently
about 50 billion short, right?

432
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,000
Yes, sir.

433
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:10,545
It's time to collect on everything.

434
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,382
Sell off anything that's of any value.

435
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,885
Coming through!

436
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,268
Yes, sir.

437
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:27,854
That car you mentioned just came in.

438
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:29,105
Okay.

439
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,858
I'll be right back, sir.

440
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:44,579
What's going on?

441
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:52,170
CAR WASH EXIT
NO PARKING

442
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,214
Hello!

443
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:58,093
What's happening? Damn it.

444
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:02,305
Look at this guy.

445
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:15,527
-Keep them down.
-Damn it!

446
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:24,452
That's gross, man. Damn it.

447
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:27,497
What is this punk doing?

448
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,332
Spare me.

449
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:30,250
Grab him!

450
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:32,711
You're fucking dead, you son of a bitch.

451
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:35,046
Where are you going?

452
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,257
Hey, strip him down.

453
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:41,094
Hey, come here.

454
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,518
Hello, sir. Right this way.

455
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:50,311
-Is he in there right now?
-Yes.

456
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,730
Thank you for your hard work.

457
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:55,692
-You can count it.
-Thank you, sir.

458
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:58,361
-You son of a bitch.
-Fuck.

459
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:01,781
I'm sorry.
Please give me something to wear.

460
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:05,702
You boys sure did a number on him.

461
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:06,995
-Hello, sir!
-Hello, sir!

462
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,998
It's too cold.
Can you give me some clothes?

463
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:11,624
I'm sorry, sir.

464
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:17,422
Hi there.

465
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,218
You…

466
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,430
It's you, isn't it? Fuck.

467
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,390
Motherfucker.

468
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:30,810
You were acting like hot shit.

469
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:33,396
Prick.

470
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:34,939
You know,

471
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:38,610
you shouldn't have fucked around with him.

472
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,529
Did you think he'd get scared

473
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,865
and apologize to you or something

474
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:46,618
just because your cousin's a cop?

475
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:57,629
Let me teach you a valuable lesson.

476
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:02,842
Untamed animals bite back if you hit them.

477
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:08,097
It doesn't matter how much stronger
or weaker you are than them.

478
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:10,308
They just bite back.

479
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,276
Now then.

480
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:24,197
Strip down.

481
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,448
What?

482
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,742
Take off your underwear.

483
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,452
Okay, I get it now.

484
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:31,496
Please let me off just this once.

485
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:33,915
-Damn it.
-I'm sorry.

486
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:35,416
I don't know what it's about…

487
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,543
Hey, In-beom.

488
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:39,170
Let me off the hook just this once.

489
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:44,509
Let's wrap it up.

490
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,688
Do you want to strip or not?

491
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:00,108
Don't kill me.

492
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,610
-Please let me live.
-Drink some more.

493
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:08,741
Do you want to strip or not?

494
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:20,128
I'll strip down!

495
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:21,629
Right now.

496
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,303
Good call.

497
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,556
Director Hong, let's see you strip.

498
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,491
I GOT SOMETHING BIG

499
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,660
All right, that's enough.

500
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:05,006
KICKBOXING

501
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:09,260
Get it up. Come on.

502
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:29,989
Yes.

503
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:35,995
Mr. Choi, the Kim Myeong-gil we know
is indeed the CEO of Smile Capital.

504
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:37,747
I see.

505
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,542
I'm coming to pick you up.
I'll be there soon, sir.

506
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:42,877
Okay.

507
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:06,526
I'm sorry for the sudden decision.

508
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:12,198
Recently, I've gone through
personal difficulties.

509
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:18,204
It's been decided after much thought,
so I hope you'll understand.

510
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,791
Our company will close
at the end of this month.

511
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:25,044
I will be wiring you

512
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:28,339
a year's wages and your severance pay.

513
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:33,553
Thanks for everything.

514
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:35,680
Sir, what about

515
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,600
our money that's out there right now?

516
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:41,769
I'll take care of it.

517
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:11,049
Dad.

518
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:33,821
-Yes.
-This is Oh In-muk in security, sir.

519
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:36,449
I think robbers broke into your office.

520
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,326
How many?

521
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,166
I think there are two.

522
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:11,692
Hey!

523
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:14,946
You said ten minutes is enough.

524
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:18,449
This model normally comes
with a six-digit combination.

525
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:19,492
This one has eight.

526
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:20,952
I think they modified it.

527
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:24,580
-So what?
-I need more time.

528
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:26,332
Hurry it up.

529
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:51,899
I got it!

530
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,735
Okay. Get out of the way.

531
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:04,745
PRIVATE LOAN STANDARD AGREEMENT

532
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:08,040
These promissory notes
are worth a billion won each.

533
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:28,102
What happened?

534
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,605
No one has come out.
I've stopped the elevator.

535
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:31,856
I see.

536
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:35,234
Well, shall I accompany you?

537
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:37,987
No, that's fine. Thank you.

538
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:41,073
Wait. Let me just borrow this.

539
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:41,991
Sure.

540
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,945
Who are you?

541
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,116
How did you get in?

542
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,673
Who sent you?

543
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,181
Who sent you?

544
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:30,099
Damn it.

545
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:32,393
Who sent you?

546
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:36,981
Who sent you?

547
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:39,317
Who sent you?

548
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:01,839
Fuck.

549
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:35,474
Sir, are you okay?

550
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:36,684
Kill that bastard!

551
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:27,067
It's okay, Beom. Okay?

552
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,153
-Snap out of it, Beom.
-Okay.

553
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:30,488
-Yes?
-Yes, sir.

554
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:31,906
Kang In-beom!

555
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:35,159
We don't have time.

556
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:38,204
Take all the money in the safe
and head down first.

557
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:45,294
Pull yourself together.

558
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:18,202
Sir!

559
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:20,788
He's gone.

560
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,461
-Go down first.
-Yes, sir.

561
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,901
-Mr. Choi.
-Yes?

562
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:22,182
Have you given it some thought?

563
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:28,314
Come on. What's the issue here?

564
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:31,191
Let's avoid Yang Jae-myeong.

565
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:33,152
Why?

566
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:35,613
They kill people.

567
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:37,573
Let's also move the bookstore.

568
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:39,199
Why?

569
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:40,451
Hyeon-ju.

570
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:44,788
Look at me.

571
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:50,544
I am old and tired.

572
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:53,339
There's no strength or courage left in me

573
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:55,674
to fight them.

574
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:58,802
I want to live out
my remaining days in peace,

575
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:04,642
teaching you the things
I want to teach you

576
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:09,188
and giving you the things
I want to leave to you.

577
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:13,108
That is my only wish.

578
00:44:17,946 --> 00:44:19,281
Can you help me with that?

579
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:26,205
Good.

580
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:29,041
Thank you.

581
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:54,251
The value of gold is bound to rise

582
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:57,463
whenever people lose confidence
in fiat currency.

583
00:45:57,546 --> 00:46:01,175
That's why it's safest
to have your slush fund in gold.

584
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:04,344
If you melt gold
and mix it with other gold,

585
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:06,597
it practically launders itself.

586
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:10,309
That's the first thing
I learned from Choi.

587
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:16,899
Failing to get my hands
on his hidden gold…

588
00:46:19,526 --> 00:46:20,778
I still regret it.

589
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:23,489
That old fuck.

590
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:26,992
Why did he have to close the damn company?

591
00:47:20,045 --> 00:47:21,088
Beom.

592
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:22,130
Yes, sir.

593
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:24,007
Get in here.

594
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:36,395
What do you think?

595
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:38,605
It's amazing.

596
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:45,279
Each bar is worth 500 million.

597
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:47,531
If our business in Korea goes south,

598
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:51,702
you and I will take this
and go to Vietnam.

599
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:56,999
I planted someone
in the Vietnamese government.

600
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:58,792
With this,

601
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:03,005
we should be able to live like kings
for the rest of our days.

602
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:06,717
Thank you, sir.

603
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:13,473
You're my brother.

604
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:16,143
I would do anything for you.

605
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:18,270
Beom.

606
00:48:20,814 --> 00:48:23,901
You're all I've got.

607
00:48:25,485 --> 00:48:26,486
You know that, right?

608
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:34,786
Come on.

609
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:38,707
They have the best stir-fried pork
in the world.

610
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:40,417
-It's that good?
-Yes.

611
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:51,929
Auntie?

612
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:55,766
Auntie.

613
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:57,809
Yes, it's Woo-jin.

614
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:01,271
Oh God, Woo-jin.

615
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:03,106
What happened?

616
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:06,735
I took out a private loan.

617
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:09,321
They told me to pay them back.

618
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:12,449
I told them I didn't have money
because my business isn't doing well.

619
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:14,952
They smashed everything.

620
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:16,995
God, I'm scared.

621
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:20,540
What should I do?

622
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:29,007
She can't run her business
because you wrecked the place.

623
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:31,468
How do you expect her
to pay back your interest now?

624
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:33,053
She wasn't paying back.

625
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:35,764
I'm saying go easy.
Times are tough for everyone.

626
00:49:35,847 --> 00:49:38,058
Then how am I supposed to make a living?

627
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:40,102
Why don't you pay for her?

628
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,563
You know I don't have the money for that.

629
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:45,190
Then just shut your mouth.

630
00:49:45,273 --> 00:49:48,485
Mind your own business. Got it?

631
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:49,945
Fine.

632
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:00,205
It's Im.

633
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:03,208
He's a guy I used to work with.

634
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:06,086
He got conned recently
by someone he lent 500 million won to.

635
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:08,005
-Is it Yang Jae-myeong?
-I don't know.

636
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:09,798
I didn't ask for the details.

637
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:13,093
But it was a homeless person's ID
and a mule account.

638
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:14,511
Identical MO.

639
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:16,054
It is him.

640
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:18,390
We should catch him.

641
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:22,519
I'm a victim too. I just can't do nothing.

642
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:25,063
Grandpa told us to lie low.

643
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:27,190
They're dangerous people.

644
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:29,526
I think it's wrong to do nothing.

645
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:31,528
What if I call him back

646
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:33,613
and tell him about Yang
so he can catch him?

647
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:36,908
If the goal is to catch him,
we should do it.

648
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:38,577
We might make money.

649
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:42,289
If we make money from this,
can I use it to help Auntie?

650
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:45,375
We'll split it evenly.
Feel free to use it however you see fit.

651
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:49,254
-All right.
-Then I want to help her too.

652
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:53,925
Come over here.

653
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:58,638
Come on over.

654
00:50:58,722 --> 00:50:59,639
Damn it.

655
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:03,560
Thank you.

656
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:18,867
All in.

657
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:34,424
Sir, you should take a look at this.

658
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:38,386
That car.

659
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:42,015
They turned off the engine,
but no one's getting out.

660
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:46,269
-Get ready.
-Yes, sir.

661
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:48,855
Hey, check your phone.

662
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:49,773
Yes, sir.

663
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:58,448
Sir, they're here.

664
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:02,035
Do exactly as I say in two hours.

665
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:27,102
They're here.

666
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:36,903
Let's go.

667
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:44,578
You're gonna die today, fuckers.

668
00:53:49,851 --> 00:53:50,977
Yes, sir.

669
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:53,313
You can come down now.

670
00:54:03,448 --> 00:54:04,532
Come on out!

671
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:08,536
I know you're there, so hurry up
and show yourselves, fuckers!

672
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:12,123
Come out, you son of a bitch!
Are you playing hide-and-seek?

673
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:13,500
Motherfuckers.

674
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:30,225
Please pick up…

675
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:32,185
HYEON-JU

676
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:38,858
-Yes?
-Grandpa.

677
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:40,026
The guys are in danger.

678
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:42,195
Where are you?

679
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:43,154
Run faster.

680
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:44,489
-Hey, go!
-Let's go!

681
00:54:45,073 --> 00:54:45,991
You sons of bitches!

682
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:47,284
Go.

683
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:50,328
Fuck.

684
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,038
Go!

685
00:54:53,581 --> 00:54:57,377
Fuck. This is insane.

686
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:55,745
