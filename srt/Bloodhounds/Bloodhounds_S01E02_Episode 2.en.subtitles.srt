EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

2
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:20,311
Give me a sedative.

3
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:21,312
What do we do?

4
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:23,815
-Calm down and wait here.
-My mom is very sick.

5
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:24,983
Then how long…

6
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,986
She couldn't sleep yesterday.

7
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:30,572
We'll get to them soon, so wait a bit.

8
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,242
Coming through.

KANGBUK SAMSUNG HOSPITAL

10
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,081
Doctor, please…

11
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:43,001
Out of the way, please!

12
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:46,546
You need to stay with me. Open your eyes!

13
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,821
-Thank you.
-Sure.

14
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:19,704
Mom.

15
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:21,664
Yes?

16
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:37,555
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:46,606
Let's go.

KANGBUK SAMSUNG HOSPITAL

20
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,112
-Mr. An Mun-ju?
-Yes.

21
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,579
You're very lucky
there wasn't any nerve damage.

22
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,415
Will you undergo scar removal?

23
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:48,626
We've sealed up the wound,

24
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:52,422
but you should get the procedure quickly
if you don't want it to leave a scar.

25
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:53,590
It's expensive, right?

26
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,425
I can give you a referral.

27
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:59,637
Here. Look at this photo
of a recent procedure.

28
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,849
-Do you see the scar on his forehead?
-Yes.

29
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:05,226
This is the photo before the procedure.

30
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,437
This is after the laser procedure.

31
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,396
I see.

32
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,773
It's your face, and you're still young.

33
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,568
I think it would be best
to have the procedure.

34
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,655
No, it's fine. Thank you.

35
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,576
Is there a Choi Han-seon?

36
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:23,703
Yes, please come in.

37
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:24,621
Woo-jin.

38
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:29,667
Are you all right?

39
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,921
-Let me see.
-No.

40
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:34,589
Let me see.

41
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:43,348
Jeez.

42
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:48,269
How many stitches you get?

43
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:50,146
Thirty stitches.

44
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:54,025
Jeez. Those motherfuckers.
This is seriously pissing me off.

45
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,028
Let's report it.

46
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,242
If you call the cops, your mom dies.

47
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:10,083
-I can't.
-Why not?

48
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,834
That might put my mom in danger.

49
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,171
Fuck, seriously.

50
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,548
Right. What about the contract?

51
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,511
Right. Look.

52
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,098
I've never heard of
a "loan extension fee."

53
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:26,474
You have to pay 10%

54
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:29,477
of the principal every week
until you pay off the loan.

55
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,981
Your mom took out a loan of 50 million,
so the fee alone is five million.

56
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:35,358
But once you miss a payment, it doubles.

57
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,819
The interest rate rises from 5% to 20%.

58
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:41,155
These bastards wrote it in the fine print
so people wouldn't catch it.

59
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,574
This is a scam. Your mom stood no chance.

60
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,076
What should I do?

61
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,078
Pay it back immediately.

62
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:50,039
Your interest will go up to 100 million.
Your house is collateral.

63
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,166
We don't have the money.

64
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:56,296
Damn it. Fuck, seriously.

65
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:04,178
Let's eat first.

66
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,180
What do you want to eat? I'm buying.

67
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:10,393
Rib eye.

68
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,688
You really have the energy
to joke around right now?

69
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:15,773
I really want rib eye.

70
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:17,859
Okay.

71
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,738
I'll buy you stir-fried pork.
It's as good as rib eye.

72
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:24,741
It's okay.

73
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,076
STIR-FRIED PORK
KIMCHI STEW

74
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,329
I always come here after a workout.

75
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,331
It's a routine. A perfect one.

76
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:34,459
Don't say a word and eat, understood?

77
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:37,086
-Understood.
-Hey!

78
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,213
It's so good to see you.

79
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,049
-Oh my.
-Two orders of stir-fried pork.

80
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,967
Okay, who is your new friend?

81
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,844
-Hello.
-He's my boxing friend.

82
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:46,179
Is that right?

83
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,811
-I need to take this call.
-Okay.

84
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:58,691
Hello, this is Woo-jin. How've you been?

85
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,486
Well, the thing is…

86
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,952
MY SON

87
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:12,497
Hey, Gun-woo.

88
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,832
Woo-jin looked at the contract.

89
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,709
Those people are professional con men.

90
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:20,046
There's no way it could've been avoided.
It's not your fault, Mom.

91
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:21,714
Thank you, my son.

92
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:25,968
What did they say about your face?

93
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,429
They say it's healing nicely.

94
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,348
That's a relief.

95
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,518
I'll clean up the café later with Woo-jin.

96
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,520
You should rest at home today.

97
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:40,608
No, I will clean it up.
Just leave it alone, okay?

98
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:43,653
It's fine. I will do it
on my way back home, okay?

99
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,238
Your food is ready.

100
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,828
Mom, I'll call you back on my way home.

101
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,663
-All right.
-Okay.

102
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,964
Help me out just this once.

103
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:05,341
It's not for me, but for a friend of mine.

104
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:08,928
I'll pay the principal and interest
on time. There'll be no issues.

105
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:13,391
We can get a 2% interest loan
from other places too. Please, come on.

106
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,726
Please give me a 1% loan.

107
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,937
I'm begging you. Just this once.

108
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,690
It's because I really care about this kid.

109
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,192
Please help me out.

110
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,653
Do you know how many loan payments
I collected for you?

111
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,197
I did that for you
with no strings attached.

112
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,979
Why didn't you call me?

113
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,647
It just came out.

114
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:03,524
Have some.

115
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:06,068
This is the tastiest
spicy stir-fried pork in Korea.

116
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,035
-Right?
-Yes.

117
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:14,952
Let's eat.

118
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,925
LET'S TALK AT THE OFFICE

119
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:32,303
He has a short temper,
so just keep your head down for a bit.

120
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:34,138
Let me do the talking.

121
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:35,056
Okay.

122
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,560
-Mr. Seo.
-Yes?

123
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,020
How much is this?

124
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,397
That should be around 20 million won.

125
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,942
Brother! Woo-jin is here!

126
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,904
Hey, you bastard. You have some nerve,

127
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:52,114
popping up all of a sudden,
asking for money.

128
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,575
You think I have anything nice to say?

129
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,911
-Jeez, I'm sorry.
-Forget it.

130
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:58,037
Come on.

131
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,247
Damn it.

132
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,333
-Sit.
-Hey, sit.

133
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,251
Okay.

134
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:11,551
How exactly did you end up with debt?

135
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,637
A bunch of thugs got him. Smile Capital.

136
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:18,057
Smile Capital? Those guys in Gwangan-dong?

137
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,101
I don't know the location.

138
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,228
Jeez.

139
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:26,023
Hey, Smile Capital isn't just
a bunch of goons.

140
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,608
They are a huge company.

141
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,360
How much do you owe?

142
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,071
-A hundred million won.
-Jeez.

143
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,076
You're totally screwed.

144
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,078
Exactly. So help us out.

145
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,580
You have a lot of money.

146
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:47,336
I'll give you a 1% interest loan
of 100 million for one year.

147
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:51,007
Thank you so much.

148
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:56,095
In exchange, I want you
to work for me like you used to.

149
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:58,848
This industry is booming,
thanks to COVID-19.

150
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,183
Let's strike while the iron's hot
and make money.

151
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,060
Help me out.

152
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:06,480
I'll give you a fat bonus
on every collection you make.

153
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,443
Jeez. This is a bit sudden.

154
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:11,652
Damn it.

155
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:14,155
Work as a bloodhound with me for a year.

156
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:17,283
Hey, this is an opportunity.

157
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,827
It's an opportunity to make big money.

158
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,622
When would you ever
get to make this much money?

159
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:26,500
I know what you mean,
but this is so sudden…

160
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,462
-Make up your mind.
-Let's go.

161
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:32,048
What?

162
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,383
Don't these runs involve beating people?

163
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,305
If you prey on the weak for money,
that makes you a thug.

164
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,390
We're boxers.

165
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:44,977
Hey, kiddo.

166
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,564
If you don't pay back Smile Capital,
you're going to die.

167
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,274
They'll even take your organs.

168
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:03,579
What are you doing?

169
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:07,083
Thank you for everything.
I'll come by some other time.

170
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,043
Hey, let's go.

171
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,504
Are you fucking with me?

172
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:15,216
Does it look like I am?

173
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,018
I'm just kidding.

174
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,688
See you again.

175
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:32,483
Hey, let's go.

176
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,905
Fuck.

177
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,366
Hey, boxer.

178
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,874
-Stamp it.
-Okay.

179
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:53,462
Once your business takes off,
make sure to give us a cut too, okay?

180
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,132
Thank you so much.

181
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,930
-Great work, sir.
-Let's go.

182
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:12,958
There's no problem, right?

183
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,627
No, sir.

184
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,338
Right. Here.

185
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:19,590
Here's the money we collected today.

186
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:25,596
We are going around
gathering IDs from homeless people.

187
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,181
Who are you?

188
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:29,433
What are you looking at?
Get back to your work.

189
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:30,434
Okay.

190
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:36,524
We will work hard to get you the amount
you require as soon as possible.

191
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,237
Can you get it done this week?

192
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,322
This week? I'll try, sir.

193
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:46,075
KIM JUN-MIN

194
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,664
MASKS ARE REQUIRED
IN THE WAITING ROOM

195
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:59,713
I hope I didn't keep you
waiting for too long.

196
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,760
Why aren't you wearing your mask?

197
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:06,345
I'll wear it.

198
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:10,182
No, I'm not telling you to put it back on.
I asked you why you took it off.

199
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,434
You kept us waiting for over 30 minutes.

200
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,519
It was too stuffy.

201
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:17,523
Punk! How do you expect to protect people
when you have no patience?

202
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:20,818
What does wearing a mask
have to do with protecting people?

203
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:21,735
Get out.

204
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:23,779
Leave!

205
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:26,949
Fuck.

206
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,036
That bastard.

207
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:33,831
Damn it.

208
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,002
-You had your mask off, didn't you?
-No.

209
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:38,919
I saw.

210
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:40,796
I just had it pulled down.

211
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,258
That's the same as taking it off.
Don't make an excuse, coward. Get out!

212
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,135
I said, get out!

213
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,928
Fuck.

214
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,307
"Fuck"?

215
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,893
"Fuck"?

216
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,394
Jeez.

217
00:14:58,606 --> 00:14:59,648
Pull down your mask.

218
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:05,112
What is your name?

219
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:06,780
Cheon Dong-woo, sir.

220
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,198
I see. What's your height?

221
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,242
I'm 187 centimeters and 74 kilograms.

222
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:11,869
Any training?

223
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:14,288
I've done ten years
of kickboxing and hapkido.

224
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:17,499
-What's your major?
-Security Services at Yongheon University.

225
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:23,255
Wow. You're a total elite.

226
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,298
Any military service?

227
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:25,299
I was exempt.

228
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,427
I tore my ACL
while playing foot volleyball.

229
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,262
I see.

230
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:32,848
See you next time.

231
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,767
May I ask why you're turning me down?

232
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:36,727
I'm looking for a Marine.

233
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,228
Does it have to be a Marine?

234
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,147
Yes.

235
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:44,193
Damn it. Then you should've mentioned that
in your job post.

236
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,362
Hold up. "Damn it"?

237
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,447
You just wasted my time!

238
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,991
That's not the way
to behave in front of your elder.

239
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,284
Screw that.

240
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,745
As a fucking elder,
you shouldn't screw around like that--

241
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,167
I'll see you next time, okay?

242
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:01,585
Yes, sir!

243
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:07,049
MARINE
IF IT DOESN'T WORK, MAKE IT WORK!

244
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,138
1216TH CLASS HONG WOO-JIN

245
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,274
Get over here.

246
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:26,902
Why are we running?

247
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,529
He was in the 734th class!

248
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:35,536
There is only one man in Korea
who can move a trillion in cash

249
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:37,579
with just one phone call.

250
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,540
Chairman Bang Seong-ho.

251
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:45,004
And there's only one person
who knows what Chairman Bang looks like.

252
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,797
There's always one person
for each situation.

253
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,424
Keep quiet.

254
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:52,553
Chairman Bang only trusted
and offered his tutelage to one person.

255
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,096
That person is Mr. Choi.

256
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:58,600
And Mr. Choi is the reason
I'm able to make a living in this field.

257
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,103
You understand this universe now, right?

258
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,229
-Well, yes.
-Yes.

259
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:04,523
All right. I like that.

260
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,776
Mr. Choi is currently looking
to hire someone.

261
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:11,363
Someone willing to risk their lives
in any situation to save a person.

262
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,198
Someone respectable.

263
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:17,286
Someone somewhat knowledgeable
about our line of work.

264
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:21,623
Yesterday, I started going through
some applicants,

265
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,834
but they all fell short.

266
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:27,796
During that time,
a junior Marine called me.

267
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,715
Talk about impeccable timing!

268
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:33,677
My friend here is a Marine too.
He's a senior Marine.

269
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:35,137
What class are you?

270
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,722
The 1207th, sir.

271
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,974
I'm the 734th.

272
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:43,437
-You see that?
-Man, I like what I see!

273
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,607
I will put in a good word
about you two to Mr. Choi.

274
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:49,193
So put down your ID numbers here.

275
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:50,527
Well, sir.

276
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:55,699
We actually contacted you
because we need a loan.

277
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:59,536
That's why I'm telling you
to go meet Mr. Choi.

278
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,705
He can be scary as a tiger,

279
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,792
but he has the deepest
and most understanding heart.

280
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,835
Once he accepts you as one of his own,

281
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,296
he will always take care of you
like a true Marine!

282
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:11,340
Is he a senior Marine?

283
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,343
Are you asking if he's a Marine?

284
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,511
Yes.

285
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:20,140
He got an exemption
for dropping out of middle school.

286
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,685
I see. It was a figure of speech.

287
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:27,981
Kind of like how rappers say,
"This is hip hop. That is hip hop." Right?

288
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:33,987
What are you talking about?
Just write down your ID numbers!

289
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:35,447
Yes, sir.

290
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:43,539
I saw the look on his face.

291
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,707
-Yes.
-I think things will work out.

292
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,668
-Thank you.
-Let's go.

293
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:49,461
There's nothing to thank me for.

294
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:52,464
Anyway, how many did you fight?

295
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:54,550
Maybe around ten?

296
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:56,969
But one guy took me down.

297
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,303
Just one?

298
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:02,182
He was built like a tank.
He grabbed me and headbutted me.

299
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,601
There's not much
you can do about headbutts.

300
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,564
Hey. What if

301
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:12,651
you have to work as a debt collector
to pay off your mom's loans?

302
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:13,652
What will you do?

303
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,201
Let's think about it together.

304
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:36,008
Excellent work, as usual.

305
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:37,885
Thank you.

306
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:41,430
No, we will take care of that.

307
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,724
That is Mr. Oh's specialty.

308
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,392
All right.

309
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:49,188
Let's eat at Yang-jung's place
sometime soon.

310
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,189
See you.

311
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:56,528
Yang Jae-myeong went
to Chungjeong-ro and Myeong-dong

312
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:59,573
to take out 400 million in cash
from seven different loan sharks.

313
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,911
He then gave it to a director who works
for Smile Capital in Gwangan-dong.

314
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:05,787
Do you know him?

315
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:08,916
I don't know him.

316
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:11,293
Yang Jae-myeong is stealing
identities of the homeless

317
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,961
to create shell corporations,

318
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,547
and he's borrowing money from loan sharks.

319
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:18,217
Loan sharks fall for it
since they don't share information

320
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,511
with each other, and they don't have
any knowledge of this trick.

321
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:25,349
So they find out when they go
to the fake company to collect the money.

322
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:29,061
This was plotted by someone
who is well-versed in how cash flows.

323
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:32,814
Looks like Yang Jae-myeong is just a pawn.

324
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,359
How do you know about this?

325
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:38,362
Was it the year 2001? Or was it 2002?

326
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:41,573
A guy pretending to volunteer
at a facility for the disabled

327
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:44,034
stole a bunch of IDs.

328
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:47,329
He created a paper company
and used it to take out a loan

329
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:52,000
worth seven billion won
from loan sharks in Myeong-dong

330
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,919
and ran off to the Philippines.

331
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,088
That's worth tens of billions today.

332
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,132
What are we going to do?

333
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,384
What?

334
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:03,136
Those loan sharks are getting conned.

335
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,930
In a way, they're your juniors.

336
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,848
I'm sure they'll manage well themselves.

337
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:10,185
Loan sharks can't exactly go to the cops.

338
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:15,148
Hyeon-ju, this is something
they should solve by themselves.

339
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:19,444
I am someone that is dead to this world.

340
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:21,571
I lived that way for ten years.

341
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:26,326
So, what happened to that person
who went to the Philippines?

342
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,244
Did he get caught?

343
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:29,371
The people who lost money to him

344
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:32,124
sent bloodhounds to the Philippines.

345
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:33,583
Did he die?

346
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,172
That's brutal.

347
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:40,882
Hyeon-ju.

348
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,510
Should I hire someone
to help with your work?

349
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,595
Well, no.

350
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,473
It's dangerous, and you even got hurt.

351
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,309
It's just a scratch.

352
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:51,268
Still.

353
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:53,895
It's faster and easier
for me to work alone.

354
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,063
Get some sleep.

355
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:57,733
Hey, you brat!

356
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,071
Nice shot!

357
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:07,242
Sir, why did you do that to a kid's face?

358
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,500
Who told you?

359
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,627
I asked In-beom.

360
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,838
Beom talks about these things?

361
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:23,091
-He does to me.
-Let me finish this one.

362
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:28,138
Nice.

363
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:35,103
He spat on my face in front of the boys.

364
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,482
I was setting an example.

365
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,943
If you get involved,
it's more work for me.

366
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,158
Jang-do.

367
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:51,661
You need to step forward
and take action sometimes.

368
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,497
That is how they fear you.

369
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:55,499
Yes, sir.

370
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,878
Anyway, why hasn't this rich kid
contacted me yet?

371
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:01,338
It's been over a week.

372
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:04,299
I'll talk to Mr. Park
and set up a meeting soon.

373
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,634
One meeting is all we need.

374
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:07,177
Let's do that.

375
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:26,446
38TH NATIONAL ROOKIE APPLICATION

376
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:31,785
Wow, he really built quite the physique.

377
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:34,746
Didn't you box back in the day too, sir?

378
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,165
I was just an amateur.

379
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,961
This body alone tells a story
of diligence and spirit.

380
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:43,296
Bodies don't lie.

381
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,589
That is true, sir.

382
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:49,302
But that kid doesn't know a thing
about the loan business.

383
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:52,722
Thank you.

384
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:55,892
He's the kid who's been hanging out
with Kim Gun-woo these days.

385
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:57,436
According to a detective agency,

386
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,398
he has beaten up a bunch
of gang members in Incheon

387
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:03,567
and joined the Marine Corps
to hide from them.

388
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:05,777
He's lived diligently
since being discharged.

389
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:09,489
He went on some runs,
so he should know the basics.

390
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:13,785
I think it might be good
to hire both of them.

391
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:18,665
-Let me see Gun-woo for now.
-Yes, sir.

392
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,292
There it is.

393
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,047
SUSHI

394
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,429
Hello, sir.

395
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,346
Hello.

396
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,308
You were introduced by Mr. Moon, right?

397
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:37,350
Yes.

398
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:40,437
This way, please.

399
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:48,320
-Go ahead.
-Me?

400
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,654
Yes.

401
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:30,612
Hello, I am Kim Gun-woo.

402
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:32,781
Please sit.

403
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:33,698
Yes, sir.

404
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:44,751
May I speak freely?

405
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:46,461
Yes, sir.

406
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:54,344
Did you hurt your face?

407
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:59,349
I got hurt trying to stop the loan sharks
who were destroying my mother's café.

408
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:04,312
I was once a loan shark myself.

409
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,900
It has been a while since I quit.

410
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:10,360
Yes, sir.

411
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:14,030
Now, I am in the business
of offering zero-interest loans

412
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:17,409
to sick people who can't afford treatment.

413
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:18,827
I see.

414
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:23,456
I am looking for a person.

415
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:28,295
There's a young kid
who's learning the business from me.

416
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:30,046
I see.

417
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,923
We're not related by blood.

418
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:35,093
That kid's the only family I have.

419
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:36,720
Yes, sir.

420
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:40,599
I worry that she might get hurt
while getting around alone.

421
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:46,313
So I was hoping for a good person
to be by her side and keep her safe.

422
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:50,275
It's not debt collection, right?

423
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:52,819
No, it's not debt collection.

424
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:57,449
-It's personal security.
-I see. Yes!

425
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:03,038
You might find it offensive,

426
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,915
but I've done a little digging on you.

427
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:08,001
Not at all. I'm not offended at all.

428
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:11,546
I heard that even in hardship,
you didn't lose the goodness in you

429
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:14,507
and that you've lived a diligent life.

430
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:16,926
Seeing you in person like this,

431
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,720
I see you have a strong gaze.

432
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:22,974
You seem trustworthy.

433
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,184
Thank you.

434
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:30,190
Well…

435
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,235
Why did you start boxing?

436
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:36,446
I wanted to get stronger when I was a kid.

437
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:37,864
Why?

438
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,368
My father wasn't much of a drinker.

439
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:44,996
Things became difficult
in my first year of middle school.

440
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,540
He began drinking and hitting my mom.

441
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:51,294
Seeing that when I was a child
made me want to get stronger.

442
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,466
-Does he live with you?
-No, well…

443
00:27:57,008 --> 00:28:00,387
They got divorced when I was 16.
I haven't seen him since.

444
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,932
-I'm from the countryside.
-I see.

445
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:07,394
My father was a tenant farmer.

446
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:08,353
I see.

447
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:13,191
I remember very vividly when I was ten.

448
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:16,986
There was a severe famine,
resulting in abysmal yields for the year.

449
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,988
When we failed to pay rent,

450
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:21,950
the landlord got his servants

451
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,911
to brutally beat up my father…

452
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:29,582
in front of the villagers.

453
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:33,795
My father hurt his head badly,

454
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:36,506
but we had no money to go to the hospital.

455
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:40,427
He died after suffering at home.

456
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:44,347
That's why I became determined
to make money.

457
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:48,017
I decided to help those

458
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:51,563
who could not afford treatment.

459
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:02,866
I'm saying that we should overcome

460
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:06,369
any difficult situation with a good heart.

461
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:09,831
Yes, I always have a good heart.

462
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,297
Our conversation isn't flowing.

463
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:20,800
Yes, I'm sorry.
I'm not very good with words.

464
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:23,052
-Is that so?
-Yes, sir.

465
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,601
-Come over here.
-Okay.

466
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:32,145
How did it go?

467
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:34,814
I think I did well.

468
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:37,901
Mr. Choi talked a lot,
so I mostly listened.

469
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:40,528
I told you it would go well!

470
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:43,239
Hey.

471
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:45,658
How was it?

472
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:48,620
Well, the kid is certainly no fun…

473
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:52,582
but he's a good kid.

474
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:55,752
I see.

475
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:00,924
Watch your step.

476
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:04,928
It seems he needs money urgently.

477
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:07,597
-Please take care of it today.
-Yes, sir.

478
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,683
-Give me a little.
-Eat a lot, Woo-jin.

479
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:11,976
It's a bit much.

480
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:19,192
There's not much, but please enjoy.

481
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:22,153
Ma'am, I love kimchi stew.

482
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:23,571
May I try it?

483
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:24,739
Yes, go ahead.

484
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:28,660
Be careful. It's hot.

485
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:30,995
It's so good. Thank you for this meal.

486
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:32,747
Yes, please enjoy.

487
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:39,003
Well, we really appreciate your help
with this.

488
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:42,465
Don't mention it.
Gun-woo is a dear friend of mine.

489
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,926
Besides, Marines, "Ack!"

490
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,178
Everything will work out fine.

491
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,806
Thank you.

492
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:51,307
Please dig in.

493
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:53,059
-Yes, ma'am!
-Thank you for cooking.

494
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:53,977
Sure, eat up.

495
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:56,896
Who's that?

496
00:30:58,314 --> 00:30:59,774
-I'll go see who it is.
-Okay.

497
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:01,359
Who is it?

498
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:06,114
Hello, how can I help you?

499
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,074
I work for Mr. Choi.

500
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:09,742
I see.

501
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:14,455
Nice to meet you.

502
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,749
Here. It's a hundred million won.

503
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:20,461
-What?
-It's two years' pay in advance.

504
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:23,590
I mean…

505
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,932
Work starts at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.

506
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:35,643
I will text you the office address.

507
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:43,526
Thank you, sir. Thank you so much.

508
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:46,863
You should thank Mr. Choi.

509
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:48,197
-Yes.
-I'll get going.

510
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,700
Thank you so much.

511
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:19,437
These rolled omelets are delicious.

512
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,439
I will cook you more.

513
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,109
Who was it?

514
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:28,446
Here…

515
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:34,077
Mom, the thing is,

516
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,413
I got a job
through an acquaintance of Woo-jin.

517
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:38,414
What kind of work?

518
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:43,378
I'll be a bodyguard for a family member
of a rich businessman.

519
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:46,881
He thought highly of me,

520
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:50,301
so he gave me 100 million won
as an advance on two years' worth of work.

521
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,932
-Really?
-Yes.

522
00:32:56,015 --> 00:33:00,311
Let's use this to pay off our debt first,
so it doesn't accrue interest.

523
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:11,531
I feel like I've ruined your future.

524
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,492
No, you didn't…

525
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:19,497
Living happily with you
matters more than anything to me.

526
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,290
I can train hard while working.

527
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:24,210
I'll start boxing again
once the pandemic is over. It's okay.

528
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:28,464
I'm so sorry.

529
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,056
Let's smile, okay? This is a good thing.

530
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,441
Thanks, Woo-jin.

531
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:09,797
-Hello, sir.
-Get out of the way.

532
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,007
Myeong-gil, come here.

533
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:13,801
What is it?

534
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,012
He arrived 20 minutes ago.

535
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:16,929
He's early.

536
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:19,182
He's the eldest son
of lil Group's chairman, right?

537
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:22,727
-You know him?
-Myeong-gil, be careful with that guy.

538
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,187
-Why?
-Over here!

539
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,438
Yes, sir.

540
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:28,066
Get me some wet wipes.

541
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:30,401
I pressed the bell, but no one came.

542
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,570
I'm sorry, sir.
I will get you some right away.

543
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:34,739
When I worked at Speed
as an assistant manager,

544
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:36,657
he had some drinks and fought the owner.

545
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,993
-You mean Hyeon-ji?
-Yes.

546
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,662
They had an argument
talking politics over drinks.

547
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:45,166
A few days later, the store was subjected
to a tax investigation.

548
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,294
She had to sell off her house
to pay off the taxes.

549
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:52,090
We found out later that his family
has connections everywhere.

550
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:54,967
National Tax Service, Police Agency,
Financial Supervisory Service…

551
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:56,761
His family is everywhere.

552
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:58,554
The chaebol are like that.

553
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,098
Really?

554
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:03,059
The politician Hyeon-ji cursed at
could be his family.

555
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:04,644
I see.

556
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,730
I was just worried about you.

557
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:10,149
All right.

558
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,527
Did you arrange some pretty girls?

559
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:14,946
He told us not to.

560
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,700
All right. Don't worry, okay?

561
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:23,287
He brought someone with him.

562
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:25,331
-Who?
-A senior from the Police Academy.

563
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:29,919
Is he still active?

564
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:32,421
Yes. He graduated top of his class.

565
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:36,342
Does he know you?

566
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:40,221
I don't think so.
There are several years between us.

567
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:48,396
No matter what happens, stand down.

568
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,107
-Understood?
-Yes, sir.

569
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:57,155
-I will ask them to put in a call.
-Okay.

570
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:01,784
Hello, sir.

571
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:03,452
You're here.

572
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:07,540
He is a cousin of mine.

573
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:09,584
I'm Min Gang-yong. Nice to meet you.

574
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,294
You have a great voice.

575
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:12,587
I am Kim Myeong-gil.

576
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,339
He said he had hard liquor,
so I shamelessly joined.

577
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:16,424
I hope you don't mind.

578
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:19,886
I heard you're a man who does big things.
It's an honor to meet you.

579
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:21,095
The honor is all mine.

580
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:24,724
This is Lee Jin-su, an associate of mine.

581
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:28,603
I see. We've met before, haven't we?

582
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,521
I do have a rather common face.

583
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,023
I must apologize.

584
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,025
Have a seat.

585
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:34,942
Sure.

586
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:40,531
I didn't want to drink on your dime,
so I brought my own.

587
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:42,450
I wanted to treat you today.

588
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:47,371
Let me.

589
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:55,046
I apologize on his behalf.
He does not drink.

590
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:58,174
You being the only sober one
would complicate things.

591
00:36:58,257 --> 00:37:02,595
Getting drunk together guarantees
that no one changes their mind later on.

592
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:05,890
Then why don't you drink his share too,
as a loyal friend would?

593
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:07,225
You seem like a drinker.

594
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:08,684
I like loyalty.

595
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:11,562
Sure, pour me a glass.

596
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:27,078
Look at you gulp it down.

597
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:28,829
It's smooth, right?

598
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:30,414
It is.

599
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,416
Now allow me.

600
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:35,002
Would you like a shot?

601
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,130
I think you had a bigger glass in mind.

602
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:40,007
-I'll take that.
-Sure.

603
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:43,928
Jeez.

604
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:45,888
Government employees usually drink soju.

605
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:49,809
But to drink some Blue in a glass…
I guess today is my lucky day.

606
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:58,484
Now a glass from me.

607
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:28,472
You drink well.

608
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:31,976
I'd also like a glass.
It's my liquor, after all.

609
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:33,686
Yes?

610
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,896
Sure. I'll pour it with one hand.

611
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:42,111
Go ahead.

612
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:57,752
Here.

613
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,801
Wow.

614
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:07,845
Now!

615
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,264
Bottoms up!

616
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:26,614
You both drink very well.

617
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:30,284
Gang-yong, if I get drunk
and do something stupid, please stop me.

618
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:31,994
Okay. If things get out of hand…

619
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,746
Where is it? I will…

620
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,502
arrest someone.

621
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:47,176
Gather your glasses.

622
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:05,736
Fuck.

623
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:12,118
Now that we've shared some drinks,
why don't we lay it all out on the table?

624
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,036
Let's do that.

625
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:16,747
Are you rich?

626
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:19,417
I come from a humble background,
so I'm working hard.

627
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:22,211
Do you have 100 billion?

628
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:26,590
I don't lie about money matters.

629
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:28,259
Is that so?

630
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:31,220
That's odd.

631
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:34,807
I was told that we could comb through
every nook and cranny of Smile Capital

632
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:36,934
but wouldn't even find 50 billion.

633
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:38,561
You're right.

634
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:41,439
I guess the National Tax Agency
isn't doing its job right.

635
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:42,731
Shall we call them?

636
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,151
Jeez, you're drunk.

637
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:47,945
Mr. Kim doesn't look too happy.
Hurry up and apologize.

638
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:49,655
Right. I'm sorry.

639
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:54,785
I drank too much on an empty stomach.
The alcohol is hitting me really hard.

640
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:57,538
You don't need to worry about the money.

641
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,207
Is that right?

642
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:01,917
I see.

643
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:05,629
I guess I should never worry about money.

644
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:12,136
By the way, my mom asked me
to send my regards to Chairman Bang.

645
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,513
She is thankful for back then.

646
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:18,601
But the person who got her
the money that day…

647
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:24,356
was apparently in his mid-forties.

648
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:29,570
How is it that you have remained
in your mid-forties for twenty years?

649
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:31,947
Was it plastic surgery?

650
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,117
It's really common nowadays.

651
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:41,749
I guess you thought
I wouldn't ask my mom, right?

652
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,250
What is going on?

653
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,877
Why so quiet?

654
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:49,548
Hello? Are you the type to just shut
your mouth when you're at a disadvantage?

655
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:54,678
Is that what they taught you
back in prison?

656
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:59,642
Man, this guy is laughing.

657
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:01,852
All right, smile.

658
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:05,648
Damn it, Gang-yong!

659
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:09,443
I don't feel like drinking anymore.
Let's wrap it up.

660
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:11,612
Mr. Kim.

661
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:13,989
I came up with the 100 billion won.

662
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:17,034
So we'll never cross paths again.

663
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:20,162
Come here, Kimmie.

664
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:23,624
Come on, hurry.

665
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:35,678
If you mess around

666
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:38,347
with my family name again,

667
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:41,392
you'll die.

668
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:48,315
Got it?

669
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:50,150
Yes?

670
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:56,198
You did live a diligent life!
You even have a knife wound here.

671
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:57,741
What did I tell you?

672
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:58,826
Hey, let's go.

673
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:01,453
Let's go. We were here for so damn long.

674
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:04,415
Mr. Kim, I tried to give you
the benefit of the doubt.

675
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:06,792
You looked like a hard-working guy.

676
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:20,139
Jang-do.

677
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:21,473
Yes, sir.

678
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:25,978
Go with Beom and find something
to use against that guy.

679
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:27,646
Something big.

680
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:30,524
Understood, sir.

681
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:33,944
ANTIQUES SHOPPING CENTER

682
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:43,621
-Thanks for coming with me.
-No problem.

683
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:47,374
What is it?

684
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:49,460
What?

685
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:51,795
-Are you coming in too?
-Yes.

686
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:54,965
I figured I might make my case
to Mr. Choi and get a job too.

687
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:55,966
Don't you want that?

688
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,760
I would totally love that.

689
00:43:57,843 --> 00:43:59,970
Right? So back me up
when I'm talking to him.

690
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,472
Make me look good.

691
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:03,307
-Okay.
-All right. Let's go.

692
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,367
BOOKS
PYEONGHWA BOOKS

693
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:27,373
-Hello, sir!
-Hello, sir!

694
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:31,126
You didn't get lost.

695
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:32,169
No, sir.

696
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:35,923
I used the money you gave me
to pay off my loans this morning.

697
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:38,842
Thank you so much.

698
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:42,805
I believe you will do well.

699
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:44,348
I will do my best.

700
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:48,185
Hello, sir! My name is Hong Woo-jin.

701
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:50,896
I helped Mr. Moon
with his work back in the day.

702
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:54,858
Gun-woo and I had a special relationship
in the Marine Corps.

703
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:56,026
Yes.

704
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,904
Watching Gun-woo's struggle
from the sidelines,

705
00:44:58,987 --> 00:45:02,408
I wanted to help in any way I could,
but there wasn't much I could do.

706
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:04,993
And it ate me up inside.

707
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:08,497
However, I'm so relieved
that a good person like you helped him.

708
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:10,124
I'm just so grateful.

709
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:12,167
Furthermore, I have come to the conclusion

710
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:14,294
that I may be of service to you, sir.

711
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:16,296
I'm better versed in this line of work.

712
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:20,718
I'm embarrassed
to toot my own horn in front of you,

713
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:23,178
the living legend of Myeong-dong,

714
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:25,889
but I know the ropes
better than Gun-woo here.

715
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:29,601
"Why don't I accompany Gun-woo
to show him the ropes

716
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:31,353
and help him out"?

717
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:34,356
"I mean, wouldn't this
help him out a little?"

718
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,650
"No, it might work out greatly
in his favor."

719
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:39,278
Those thoughts made me
take the liberty to come here.

720
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:41,113
With your permission,

721
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:43,323
I'd like to accompany Gun-woo
and help him!

722
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:51,790
Sure, why not?

723
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:56,462
Thank you, sir!

724
00:45:57,838 --> 00:45:58,797
Sit.

725
00:45:58,881 --> 00:45:59,798
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

726
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:03,927
-Thank you!
-Thanks for the tea!

727
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:07,431
There is one thing I didn't mention.

728
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:11,727
I may be the one paying your salary,
but I'm not the one hiring you.

729
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:13,270
Excuse me?

730
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:15,564
You still have an interview with Hyeon-ju.

731
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:18,942
I see.

732
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:20,319
Well…

733
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:23,030
What happens if I fail the interview?

734
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:25,073
You would have to return the salary.

735
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:30,245
Oh, I used it all to pay back our loans.

736
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:32,080
I believe you will do well.

737
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:33,582
What?

738
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:39,463
Hyeon-ju is vehemently against
having a bodyguard though.

739
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:42,633
But I am awful with words, Mr. Choi.

740
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:43,926
Good luck.

741
00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:45,219
Mr. Choi.

742
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:50,599
If I manage to persuade Hyeon-ju
to hire me and Gun-woo,

743
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:52,351
can I also receive a salary?

744
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:56,647
Let's do that.

745
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:57,648
Woo-jin.

746
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:01,485
I have a scalp massage I have to get to.

747
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:02,861
-Yes.
-Bye now.

748
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:04,571
Yes, sir. Enjoy your time.

749
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:05,656
Right.

750
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:08,784
Use this

751
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:11,328
to get something nice for lunch.

752
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:15,332
Okay. Thank you, sir.

753
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:19,253
I really want to work
in this perfect company.

754
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:20,170
Sir.

755
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:23,841
You two…

756
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:28,387
stick together, no matter what.

757
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:31,598
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

758
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:33,016
Godspeed!

759
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,142
-Godspeed!
-Godspeed!

760
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:46,738
What?

761
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:55,831
Fuck!

762
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:58,125
-What is it?
-Hey!

763
00:47:58,208 --> 00:47:59,334
What's this?

764
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:02,296
-It was in here.
-Really?

765
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:05,132
This has to be over a hundred million won.

766
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,466
-A hundred million?
-Hey!

767
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:13,307
Look at this.

768
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:16,518
Jeez. It's in here too.

769
00:48:18,186 --> 00:48:19,104
Hold on a second.

770
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:41,668
THERE WILL BE GUESTS AT THE BOOKSTORE
HAVE A NICE CHAT

771
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:43,545
Damn it.

772
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:47,716
17 billion, 18 billion,

773
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:50,010
19 billion…

774
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:53,931
-21 billion, 22 billion…
-Woo-jin.

775
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:55,140
To be honest,

776
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,477
I have met Hyeon-ju before.

777
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:01,480
What? What do you mean?

778
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:04,316
When I went over
to see you a few days ago,

779
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:07,694
a homeless person was being chased by her,

780
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:11,031
so I followed her and got tased.

781
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:13,283
-You got tased?
-Yes.

782
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:15,577
Well, then, did you two fight?

783
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:19,164
No, she just cursed at me. That's it.

784
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:20,749
I see.

785
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:23,877
Don't worry.

786
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,296
I'll take care of everything.

787
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,507
You just watch.

788
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:30,801
Just keep your head down.

789
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:33,595
I lost count because of you.

790
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:34,554
Sorry.

791
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:46,149
Hello, Ms. Hyeon-ju.

792
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:49,486
We were hand-picked by Mr. Choi himself

793
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:52,072
so that you can safely go about your work.

794
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:56,743
Hashtag, bodyguard.
Hashtag, please be my security personnel.

795
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,078
Hashtag, manager.

796
00:49:58,161 --> 00:50:02,374
Hashtag, your boys.

797
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:04,501
What was that?

798
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:07,713
Just think of us as your boys.
Nice to meet you.

799
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:12,843
Just say the word.

800
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:15,470
We will take care of anything you need.

801
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:17,014
I do not need anything.

802
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:21,601
Yes, so going forward,

803
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:24,062
just tell us anything you need.

804
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:27,107
No. I won't be needing anything
going forward, so leave.

805
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:34,573
Do you not like us?

806
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:37,492
How could I not like you
when we've just met?

807
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:38,577
I just don't need you.

808
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:41,830
You haven't seen us at work.
How do you know you don't need us?

809
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:44,875
I had no problem
doing things alone until now,

810
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:47,127
so I'm sure I don't need you.

811
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:49,421
Plus, I hate people who argue.

812
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:50,756
I'm not trying to argue--

813
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:53,133
That's called arguing.

814
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:54,593
Please leave.

815
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:04,186
Mr. Choi said that we could stay.

816
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:06,772
Weren't you trying to persuade me?

817
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:12,277
You're starting to fucking lie now.

818
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:14,905
I thought only your shoes were fake.

819
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:16,531
Leave.

820
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:19,284
I said get out!

821
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:23,413
Hello, do you not hear me?

822
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:25,791
Get the fuck out! Damn it!

823
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:47,562
I really need this job.

824
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:48,939
Use me for one month.

825
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:51,441
If I'm no help, then I'll leave.

826
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:53,777
Just a month, I'm begging you.

827
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:55,237
Excuse me.

828
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:58,448
If you need money,
my grandpa will lend you some.

829
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:01,368
I'll put in a word for you, so leave.

830
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:02,869
This is uncomfortable.

831
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:03,870
The money…

832
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:09,459
Mr. Choi gave me a two-year advance
on the pay already.

833
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:13,922
My mom got duped by Smile Capital
and took out a loan.

834
00:52:14,714 --> 00:52:16,716
The debt snowballed to 100 million,

835
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:20,470
so I had to pay it back this morning
with the money Mr. Choi gave me.

836
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:25,016
If I have to return the money,
I will be in deep trouble.

837
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:28,854
Please, I am begging you.

838
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:32,774
Get up.

839
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:34,276
Let's go eat.

840
00:52:44,035 --> 00:52:46,663
Why did you borrow money
from Smile Capital?

841
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:48,915
My mom got conned.

842
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:52,294
How big was the loan?

843
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:54,671
A hundred million.

844
00:52:55,463 --> 00:52:59,092
Was it over once you paid?
Were there any other damages?

845
00:52:59,759 --> 00:53:02,387
My mom runs a café,

846
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:04,764
but it is in shambles now.

847
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:06,391
I see.

848
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:10,645
Is that when you hurt your face?

849
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:12,981
Yes.

850
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:16,735
You must feel wronged.

851
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:19,779
Did you go to the police?

852
00:53:20,822 --> 00:53:21,656
No.

853
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:26,494
They threatened to kill my mom.

854
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:28,622
Who?

855
00:53:30,248 --> 00:53:31,458
Their boss.

856
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:35,086
Delicious hamburgers have arrived.

857
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:38,757
Hear me out first.

858
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:46,598
As you heard,

859
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:48,850
my grandpa is no longer a loan shark.

860
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:51,353
He provides zero-interest loans
to people in need.

861
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:53,230
But we occasionally

862
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:56,316
come across punks who try
to take advantage of his good heart.

863
00:53:56,816 --> 00:53:58,735
Yang Jae-myeong was one of them.

864
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:02,113
He lied about his mother needing
to get an operation.

865
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:04,115
He borrowed ten million won and vanished.

866
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:06,493
It took me half a year to track him down.

867
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:09,621
I saw him begging
in front of a train station.

868
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:14,167
At first, I thought Yang Jae-myeong
had really become homeless,

869
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:18,546
but I noticed how clean his teeth were
as I was passing by.

870
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:21,007
So I tailed him.

871
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:25,679
I found out that he and his goons
were pretending to be homeless

872
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:28,431
and stealing IDs
from actual homeless people.

873
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:32,769
They use the IDs to create
shell corporations and open bank accounts.

874
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:34,688
Then they con private loan sharks

875
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:38,108
and take out loans anywhere
from tens to hundreds of millions of won.

876
00:54:39,317 --> 00:54:41,528
This tactic was so professional,

877
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:44,406
we thought there would be someone
behind Yang Jae-myeong.

878
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:49,327
I found out that this person
had ties to Yang Jae-myeong.

879
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:51,454
Do you know him?

880
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,252
I do.

881
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:04,718
Our goal today is to get an exact count

882
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:08,054
of how many IDs
Yang Jae-myeong steals per night.

883
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:10,265
No matter what happens, stand down.

884
00:55:10,348 --> 00:55:11,850
If they find out we're tailing them,

885
00:55:11,933 --> 00:55:13,560
all my planning
will have been for nothing.

886
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:19,691
IDENTIFICATION CARD

887
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:32,889
There are caps in the back.
Cover your face.

888
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:00,875
Hey. How about this punk?

889
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:02,627
This bastard is too drunk.

890
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:04,712
I think he might have something on him.

891
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,303
Sir, there.

892
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:14,097
Find a bastard who isn't wasted.

893
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:15,098
Right. Okay.

894
00:57:17,058 --> 00:57:18,309
-Follow me.
-Yes, sir.

895
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:20,186
-Hey, let's go.
-Okay.

896
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:42,250
Keep your head down.

897
00:57:51,092 --> 00:57:52,719
Hello, sir.

898
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:53,720
Yes.

899
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:58,433
You shouldn't lie down on this cold floor
with just some flimsy newspaper.

900
00:57:58,516 --> 00:58:00,852
You should put something underneath
and lie down.

901
00:58:00,935 --> 00:58:02,020
Right.

902
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:03,521
Jeez.

903
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:05,064
When did you last eat?

904
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:07,400
It must have been a day or two ago.

905
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,694
We aren't shady people.

906
00:58:09,777 --> 00:58:13,156
We're from a homeless association
funded by Seoul.

907
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:14,449
I see.

908
00:58:14,532 --> 00:58:18,453
The government created this organization
so we could help each other out.

909
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:20,038
Why don't you join?

910
00:58:20,121 --> 00:58:21,080
Huh?

911
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:24,250
If you join our organization,
you won't have to sit here like this.

912
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:26,419
We will find you a job right away.

913
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:29,756
You will be given 20 masks
free of charge every month.

914
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:33,885
We will also get the 300,000 won
monthly government stipend for you.

915
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:34,886
300,000 won…

916
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,014
-Sir.
-Yes.

917
00:58:38,097 --> 00:58:41,559
If you have an ID, we can register you
with the association right away.

918
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:44,604
Then we can get you
the money by next week.

919
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:45,730
Do you understand?

920
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:47,065
-Yes.
-Okay.

921
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:50,068
Here.

922
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:53,738
Not anyone can join,
so please keep this a secret.

923
00:58:53,821 --> 00:58:54,697
Okay.

924
00:58:55,573 --> 00:58:56,407
Thank you.

925
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:58,451
That guy has a silver tongue.

926
00:58:58,535 --> 00:58:59,369
Thank you.

927
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:03,873
Four IDs so far…

928
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:17,845
-Excuse me, sir.
-Yes? What is it?

929
00:59:18,846 --> 00:59:21,057
We're from the Homeless Association.

930
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:24,102
-The thing is--
-You bastard!

931
00:59:24,602 --> 00:59:27,397
Hey, you bastard!
Where is my ID? Give me back my ID!

932
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:31,192
What? You crazy bastard! Fuck!

933
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:33,736
Let go, you fucker!

934
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:39,701
Hey! You can't get involved!

935
01:01:39,153 --> 01:01:42,115
