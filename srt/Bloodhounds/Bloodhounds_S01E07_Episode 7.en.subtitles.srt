1
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,802
Are we sure the patient is okay?

2
00:00:10,885 --> 00:00:12,095
BP is dropping again.

3
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:13,930
Hang on. Let me check.

4
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:02,771
You should eat these.

5
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:06,858
You have to eat well today.

6
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:08,193
Thank you.

7
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:09,194
You're welcome.

8
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:35,929
Excuse me. The girl that was here.
Do you know where she went?

9
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:37,430
She left a while ago.

10
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:38,640
When was that?

11
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:40,642
About ten minutes ago.

12
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,436
Thank you.

13
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:49,210
Excuse me.

14
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:53,423
Are you Hong Woo-jin's guardian?

15
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,258
Well, yes.

16
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:57,719
The operation went well.

17
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:02,140
We'll have to monitor his progress,
but the operation was a success.

18
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:12,901
Thank you.

19
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,696
Thank you so much.

20
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,159
Hang in there.

21
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,161
Okay.

22
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:02,283
BLOODHOUNDS

23
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,718
MARINE SPIRIT!
KIM MYEONG-GIL

24
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:02,844
Hey.

25
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:05,555
It freaks me out every time.

26
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:07,932
Let's go.

27
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:18,985
Let's go.

28
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,117
Let's run.

29
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,014
Eighty-six!

30
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:31,891
Eighty-eight!

31
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:33,393
Eighty-nine!

32
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:34,977
-Ninety!
-Ten more!

33
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,021
One!

34
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:38,856
Two!

35
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,774
Three!

36
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:43,945
Twelve.

37
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:45,446
Thirteen.

38
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:48,533
Fourteen.

39
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:50,118
Good morning, sir.

40
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,578
Good morning, sir.

41
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,301
Let's keep going.

42
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:12,765
Fifteen.

43
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:14,934
Sixteen.

44
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:16,519
One, two, three, four!

45
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,772
One, two, three, four, five!

46
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,107
One, two, three, four!

47
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,359
One, two, three, four!

48
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,862
One, two, three, four!

49
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:27,947
One, two, three, four!

50
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,408
One, two, three, four!

51
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,803
Man, you actually did it!

52
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,521
Woo-jin, get up.

53
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:05,818
To break their balance,
we should do this to topple them--

54
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,028
Guys.

55
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,946
We need to talk.

56
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,035
I said no.

57
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:17,288
If you go back,
you'll die a pointless death.

58
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:21,751
I know why
you're worried about us, Mr. Oh.

59
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,169
Then why won't you listen?

60
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,921
Are you rebelling?

61
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,589
Mr. Oh.

62
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:29,425
Today, I'll tell you what I think.

63
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:35,097
I believe we can fight
Kim Myeong-gil and win.

64
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:43,064
Yang-jung and Du-yeong are dead.

65
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:44,774
How can you guys win?

66
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,944
By following Mr. Choi's instructions.

67
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:53,866
Many have lost their families
and had precious things taken away by Kim.

68
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,245
Mr. Choi said if we gathered them
and combined our strengths,

69
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,288
we would win no matter what.

70
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:03,000
Everyone is hiding
because they can't win fighting alone.

71
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:07,713
But if people like me and Woo-jin show up,
I'm sure they'll help us.

72
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,926
What if Kim Myeong-gil
catches you beforehand?

73
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,678
We're capable of fighting.

74
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:16,597
Woo-jin has fully healed,
and I've gone up two weight classes.

75
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,099
My punches are stronger now.

76
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:20,893
We're more than ready
to take down his goons.

77
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,479
If we take everyone's advice,

78
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,690
I believe we can take Kim Myeong-gil down.

79
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:30,611
I won't allow it,

80
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:32,738
and that's that.

81
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:16,907
Mr. Oh, I'll be in Rome
by the time you read this letter.

82
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:21,662
I rented out a small room
with the money Grandpa gave me.

83
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,791
I promised Grandpa
that we'd go to Rome together

84
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,585
after getting Kim Myeong-gil,

85
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:29,920
but I ruined everything.

86
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:33,591
I won't ask you to understand my actions.

87
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:39,055
But if I stay here, I'll think of Grandpa.
And I don't think I can handle that.

88
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:42,350
Wherever I go, I'm reminded of Grandpa,

89
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,394
and I can't stop crying.

90
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,605
It's driving me insane.

91
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:51,233
It'll get better
if I go somewhere far away.

92
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,527
I love you,

93
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:55,196
and I'm sorry.

94
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:10,127
Man, this hurts so much.

95
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,338
What you're feeling isn't pain.

96
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,965
It's your weaknesses leaving your body.

97
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,425
What does that mean?

98
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,595
It means you're stronger today
than yesterday.

99
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,059
Guys.

100
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:27,228
Follow me.

101
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:31,691
Yes, sir.

102
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:53,129
This is the last
of Mr. Choi's emergency fund.

103
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:54,797
Take it and go.

104
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:59,552
I tried to hold you back
because of my worries. I'm sorry.

105
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:02,555
I'll prepare a room
and car for you in Seoul.

106
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:04,432
Stay safe.

107
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,686
Thank you, Mr. Oh.

108
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,733
We'll win, no matter what.

109
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:52,563
STONE VILLAGE

110
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:56,567
Unit 809.

111
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:01,655
Woo-jin.

112
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:12,541
Yes?

113
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:17,838
Yes, hello.

114
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:21,050
We were sent by Mr. Oh In-muk.

115
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:30,601
Come in.

116
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:31,602
Let's go.

117
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:45,449
Now, if I come back and notice
any signs of tampering with the tape,

118
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,034
I'll report you to the police.

119
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:48,786
Why is that?

120
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,871
My underwear is in there.

121
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,333
Right, that will never happen.

122
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,003
One bed here and one on top.

123
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,296
Who wants the top?

124
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,215
-It doesn't matter.
-Yes.

125
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,342
Then you take the top.

126
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:04,343
All right.

127
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:08,931
I'm sorry, but may I ask
the reason for that decision?

128
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,392
I felt like it.

129
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:13,477
I see.

130
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:19,984
Here are the keys to the door
and the car Grandpa told me to rent.

131
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:25,155
Also, here's my number.
But if possible, don't call.

132
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,073
I'm busy.

133
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,701
-Will that do?
-Yes.

134
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:30,327
Now, then.

135
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,461
Thank you.

136
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,130
Um--

137
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:46,343
Hey, hold on.

138
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,597
Did she refer to Mr. Oh as Grandpa?

139
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,390
Yes, she must be his granddaughter.

140
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,854
Right. They look alike,
now that I think about it, right?

141
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:58,772
They're both small and wear glasses.

142
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:03,235
But didn't it seem like she was forced
to lend us her place?

143
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,236
-Right?
-Yes.

144
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:06,864
I feel bad.

145
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:08,699
Enough of that.

146
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,535
-Let's wash up and strategize.
-All right.

147
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,080
-God, my stomach really hurts.
-Whoa, ouch.

148
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:39,647
The reason being?

149
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,983
I think we need to capture
Yang Jae-myeong first and gather intel.

150
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:43,984
What about you?

151
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,072
MR. MOON, PRESIDENT IM

152
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:50,741
I think we need to gather allies first.

153
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:52,534
Moving together will create synergy.

154
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:53,702
I like that too.

155
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,414
But how are we going to find him?

156
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:00,209
Mr. Choi said he'd be our greatest asset.

157
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,878
I thought about it on our way to Seoul.

158
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,130
But it won't be easy
to meet the lil Group heir.

159
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,091
I'll come up with a plan somehow.

160
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:08,008
All right.

161
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,307
-Woo-jin!
-What?

162
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,232
You can drop the top on this model.

163
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,733
-The roof retracts?
-Yes.

164
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,110
It's made of fabric.

165
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:37,788
Brother.

166
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,584
A lot of loan sharks in Myeong-dong

167
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,212
got screwed over by Smile Capital,
just like you.

168
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:47,673
I suggest we gather them
and form a united front.

169
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:49,550
The loan sharks in this neighborhood…

170
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,094
You know all of them
through your connections.

171
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:55,639
If you were to take the lead,
those folks would all fall in line.

172
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,268
And after that?

173
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,395
You can take back your money

174
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:05,274
and make sure Smile Capital never pulls
this kind of stunt again.

175
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,110
We'll obliterate them. How's that?

176
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,945
You lost a few hundred million.

177
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,037
I can't do it.

178
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:21,707
If your plan goes south, I might die.

179
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,375
What about the money you lost?

180
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,918
Fuck the money.

181
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,880
I can just make it back, okay?

182
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,840
I'm not getting involved.

183
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:32,468
I value my life over money.

184
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,595
-Please, just this once--
-Stop.

185
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:52,237
Hey, what the fuck?

186
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,032
What happened?

187
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,328
Sir?

188
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:02,748
You aren't allowed in here.

189
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,794
Well, if it isn't my junior marines!

190
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:08,921
Sir, what happened?

191
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,714
What?

192
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:12,341
Well…

193
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:14,927
A few days ago,

194
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:18,430
a bunch of gangsters came
and took everything.

195
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,557
Why?

196
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:32,402
I have ten billion won in bonds
that expire in a month.

197
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:38,575
If you get this money back for me,
I'll give you a 5% cut.

198
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:43,372
This sounds too good to pass up.

199
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,998
Then shall we seal the deal?

200
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:51,630
An elegant lady like yourself
must not know how these deals work.

201
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,341
Well, matters like this

202
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:57,261
are generally based on mutual trust.

203
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,930
That's how they go down.

204
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:07,980
I'll find someone else.

205
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,526
Wait, hold on now.

206
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:16,155
In general, there may be
exceptions to the rule.

207
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,913
I found out later.

208
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:28,959
In the middle of that contract,
in fine print,

209
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:31,712
it said that if I couldn't recover
the bonds in one month,

210
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:34,298
I had to compensate them
for half of the entire amount.

211
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:35,841
That's what was written.

212
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,889
That contract sounds
like Smile Capital's MO.

213
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,807
What's that?

214
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,767
A company run by Kim Myeong-gil.

215
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,730
The one that used to work for Mr. Choi?

216
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,190
Yes.

217
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,066
Where's that son of a bitch now?

218
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,654
Sir, have you heard about Mr. Choi?

219
00:19:58,405 --> 00:19:59,239
Heard what?

220
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:00,824
Mr. Choi…

221
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,871
was killed by Kim Myeong-gil.

222
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,294
What the hell are you talking about?

223
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:16,131
Kim Myeong-gil killed Mr. Choi, Mr. Hwang,
and Mr. Lee. He killed them all.

224
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:22,012
We've been lying low in the countryside
with Mr. Oh until recently.

225
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:25,182
Fuck, this isn't funny at all.

226
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,979
Man, fuck.

227
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,316
Hey, this isn't funny, okay?

228
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,967
Why would Mr. Choi die?

229
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,261
Why?

230
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:04,805
Why would Mr. Choi

231
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:06,974
be dead?

232
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:11,853
Answer me, you bastards!

233
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:12,854
Fuck.

234
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:19,027
What do you mean he's dead, you punks?

235
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,795
Man, I'm tired.

236
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:37,921
I'm so tired.

237
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:41,049
Let's go in and get some rest.

238
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,217
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

239
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,015
What the hell?

240
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:52,269
It's been a while.

241
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,982
-These motherfuckers.
-Damn it.

242
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:13,290
I'll tell you everything,
so just don't hit me, okay?

243
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:15,876
Word spread in the homeless community,

244
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:18,795
so we've been collecting IDs
at facilities for the disabled, sir.

245
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,714
We weren't asking about you.

246
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:22,466
How are things at Smile Capital?

247
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,011
You should've been more specific
with your questions.

248
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:27,888
Has the casino opened?

249
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:30,766
Hold on a sec.

250
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:32,267
Hey, look down.

251
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,104
What is it?

252
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:41,109
Gun-woo, try putting on a tough guy act.

253
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,195
How do I do that?

254
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:45,113
For starters, drop the formal language.

255
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:51,495
But that man's clearly well over 40.
I'm uncomfortable talking down on him.

256
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:56,124
All right. If he looks down on you,
give him a good smack.

257
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,168
All right.

258
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:05,842
For one, this might be hard to believe,
but I'm actually 31.

259
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:08,970
Secondly, I don't look down on you,
so there's no need for violence.

260
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,139
My body is a train wreck right now.

261
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:14,267
A while back, some fucker severed
both my Achilles heels,

262
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,728
so I spent four months in rehab.

263
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,814
That fucker is our brother.
Watch your mouth.

264
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:23,777
What happened back then was totally on me.
I totally had that coming.

265
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,321
So, about the casino…

266
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:27,864
Yes.

267
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:30,075
I eavesdropped
on the director's phone call--

268
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:32,202
Director? What's his name?

269
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:33,161
Kim Jun-min, sir.

270
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,415
He's alive?

271
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:39,126
Some fucker slashed his neck,
so he almost died--

272
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:40,585
Damn it.

273
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:44,339
Right, you're all on the same team.

274
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,718
Okay, I understand everything now, 100%.

275
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:52,222
I'm going to watch my mouth now,
so there's no need to beat me, sirs.

276
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:55,392
I really hate Kim Jun-min.
That fucker's a real shithead.

277
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:57,519
Smile Capital's also a bunch
of motherfuckers.

278
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,479
I'm only in it for the money, okay?

279
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:02,107
I've wanted to let this out.
I'll tell you everything.

280
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,568
We get it, so please get to the point.

281
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:08,822
I overheard a call. They're still fighting
with Iil Group over the contract,

282
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:11,491
so I heard Kim Myeong-gil is on edge.

283
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:12,617
And?

284
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:15,537
There's Im Jang-do.
He's not cool with Kim Jun-min.

285
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,997
A real fuck-nugget, right?

286
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,041
He was in charge of the cops,
but he disappeared one day.

287
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,044
But Kim Myeong-gil was having fun
at a hostess bar recently

288
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,839
and got into some beef
with some punk and broke his wrist.

289
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,758
So the cops got called,
and it was a real mess,

290
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,802
but it was as if nothing had happened.

291
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:34,848
That's not how things are supposed to go
when cops are called to the scene.

292
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:38,810
According to Kim Jun-min, Kim Myeong-gil
has found a guy to replace Im Jang-do.

293
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:41,605
But he still hasn't told anyone yet.

294
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,398
Why?

295
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,233
He doesn't trust his own men.

296
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:46,818
And?

297
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:50,489
He plans on taking over
a golf course in Gyeonggi-do.

298
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,408
That's the reason
we're busting our balls like this.

299
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,744
We get paid peanuts,
but they work us like mules.

300
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:57,412
-Right, guys?
-Yes.

301
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:00,999
That concludes my brief
on the current issues.

302
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:04,669
Hold on a sec.

303
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:16,014
You know you're fucked
if we send this to Kim Jun-min, right?

304
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:17,140
Keep your mouth shut.

305
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,350
Do not worry, sir.

306
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,811
If you need anything,
please feel free to call me.

307
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:24,648
I also want to see
Smile Capital crash and burn.

308
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:27,901
Then, can you get us
the Iil Group heir's phone number?

309
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,403
That's beyond my capabilities.

310
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:33,698
Those folks keep a tight lid on privacy.

311
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:37,327
IIL GROUP CHAIRMAN'S ELDEST SON

312
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:42,582
IIL GROUP HEIR
CONFIDENT TO DEVELOP A GLOBAL HOTEL

313
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:46,545
I see. His name is Hong Min-beom.
He has the same last name as me.

314
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:47,963
Woo-jin.

315
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:50,632
Seoul has the best jajangmyeon around.

316
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:51,716
Yes.

317
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:59,307
Why are you using my computer
without permission?

318
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,726
I'm logged into
all of my messenger apps on that.

319
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,646
I'm sorry. We didn't open any of the apps.

320
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:07,482
Go to the Internet café next door.

321
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,359
Okay. I'm sorry.

322
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:10,735
Hurry up and turn it off.

323
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:11,778
I get it.

324
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:13,280
Let us use it just this once.

325
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:15,865
Make it quick.

326
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:16,825
All right.

327
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:18,451
We're sorry.

328
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:19,536
This is tiring.

329
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:22,706
How'd she know?

330
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:26,293
She must've gotten a login notification
when we turned on the computer.

331
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:37,679
-Damn.
-What is it?

332
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:41,266
Hong Min-beom has 500,000 followers.

333
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:43,685
Let's see now.

334
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:04,748
Whoa, stop!

335
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:30,065
Did I…

336
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:35,528
not tell you to get the contract ready
by today so I can send the money?

337
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,114
I was going to,

338
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:40,909
but my father--

339
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:43,161
You bastard. How dare you!

340
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:57,926
Beom.

341
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:13,942
Please don't kill me.

342
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:19,906
Fix the contract as I said,
and bring it to me by this Friday.

343
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:21,825
-Okay.
-If not, I'll release the footage.

344
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:26,329
I'll make it look like you committed
suicide because of the video. Got it?

345
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,918
Yes, sir.

346
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:22,343
Do you want to get rid of Kim Myeong-gil?
We can help you.

347
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,263
Fuck, who the hell are these bastards?

348
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:31,728
WE KNOW WHERE THE HARD DRIVE
CONTAINING YOUR FOOTAGE IS LOCATED

349
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:33,855
Let's meet them.

350
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:38,359
If we're going to, let's do it quickly.
I have to have the contract by Friday.

351
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:41,112
Then ask if they can meet up now.

352
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,572
What if they say yes?

353
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:44,157
Meet them at the bar you go to.

354
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,326
They'll show their true colors
once they drink.

355
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:48,286
Damn it.

356
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,374
Don't worry.
I'll get two of my men to come.

357
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:08,348
Hey, In-seong.

358
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:09,599
-Yes.
-Tastes good, right?

359
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:10,600
Yes, sir.

360
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,393
I'm telling you not to drink.

361
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,562
Yes, sir.

362
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,441
Woo-jin.

363
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:22,904
Hello, sir.

364
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:24,405
Hello, sir.

365
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:30,662
I'm Min-beom's cousin.

366
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:32,664
I see. I'm Kim Gun-woo.

367
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:34,541
I'm Hong Woo-jin.

368
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,042
I DM'ed you.

369
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,754
-Let's sit.
-Yes, sir.

370
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:48,304
Why don't we chat over some drinks?

371
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:49,389
Well…

372
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:52,308
Well…

373
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:56,145
I'm really sorry,

374
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,357
but I got stabbed
by Kim Myeong-gil's goons

375
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,694
and tore my liver, so I can't drink.

376
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:09,492
If you don't want to drink,
just say so. It's fine.

377
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:16,541
It's true, sir.

378
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:18,209
Here, here,

379
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:19,961
and here.

380
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:23,506
We get it.

381
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,009
It's disturbing to see. Pull it down.

382
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:27,886
Yes, just sit out, then.

383
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:29,596
You got stabbed too?

384
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,390
Well, no. I just don't drink.

385
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:37,478
We're going to have a deep conversation.
Let's drink.

386
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:45,904
Didn't you gather us here
to put all our cards on the table?

387
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:49,157
If you back out of something so trivial,
how can we trust you?

388
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:51,659
And if I may be blunt,

389
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:55,204
you asked to meet because you need us too.

390
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:05,673
In that case, I'll take a glass.

391
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:08,718
No, I will drink.

392
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,514
All right.

393
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:17,352
Now, Director Hong.

394
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:19,187
Sure.

395
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:26,361
Now, let's drink.

396
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:30,073
Bottoms up.

397
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:32,241
Okay.

398
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:42,961
Damn, you're a natural.

399
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:46,798
Since we're busy,
why don't we drink from these glasses?

400
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:48,508
That's the way to drink whiskey.

401
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:49,968
-Okay.
-Here.

402
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,595
-Here.
-Here.

403
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:43,312
Damn.

404
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:45,106
-Hey, slow down a bit.
-Okay.

405
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:56,659
Now we're talking.

406
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:02,915
Damn it.

407
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:34,655
This is fun.

408
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,075
Gang-yong, nice to meet you.

409
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:40,703
I've been stressed
because of that bastard Kim Myeong-gil.

410
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:43,081
-Call me brother, man.
-Brother.

411
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:45,333
-Yes! That's me. All right, pour.
-Yes, sir!

412
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:48,544
Because of that son of a bitch,

413
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:52,590
I now have spot baldness

414
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:55,009
and hemorrhoids, damn it.

415
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:58,262
He beat me when we met earlier today.

416
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,348
Son of a bitch.

417
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:04,185
The police commissioner fucking adores me!

418
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,813
When it's just us two, he says,
"Hey, Commissioner Min…"

419
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:08,815
Then I say, "Hey, brother! Don't do that."

420
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:11,984
"This Commissioner Min thing,
people might get the wrong idea."

421
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:16,405
Gang-yong, take care of this kid.
We're family now.

422
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,658
Take good care of him.
He seems like a good kid.

423
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:22,370
You and Woo-jin, the two of you,
do whatever you want.

424
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:25,164
Fuck it. I got your back, all the way.

425
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:26,541
Shall I pour you a shot?

426
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,292
-I can't drink anymore.
-Yes, sir.

427
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:29,919
I can't because of my hemorrhoids.

428
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:32,421
Fuck, it's because
I worked overtime yesterday.

429
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:35,007
I can usually drink
for at least another two hours.

430
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:55,736
Damn it.

431
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:07,790
Gang-yong.

432
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:16,299
What the hell?

433
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:19,969
Min-beom, did you sleep well?

434
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,097
Did you sleep well?

435
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:26,392
What's going on?

436
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:32,273
You brought us to your place last night
to continue drinking.

437
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,274
I see.

438
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:35,776
I made ramyeon,
so we meant to wake you up.

439
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,944
-We should eat.
-Okay.

440
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:37,987
Take a seat.

441
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:40,865
-Gun-woo, take this.
-All right.

442
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,450
-I'll wake Gang-yong up.
-All right.

443
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:45,119
Damn, how much did I drink?

444
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:50,708
Gun-ho? Gun-woo?

445
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:52,960
It's Gun-woo.

446
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:53,961
Right.

447
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,423
What was the plan again?

448
00:36:57,506 --> 00:37:01,219
Gang-yong is going to bring
a computer expert from the police agency.

449
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:05,765
That person will hack Kim's phone,
then burn the hard drives in the safe.

450
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:08,935
The ramyeon's all done.
You should eat and sober up.

451
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:09,977
Get up.

452
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:15,316
We'll do it Friday when Kim Myeong-gil
comes to Iil Group to sign the contract.

453
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:16,275
Who decided that?

454
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:19,278
You did.

455
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:23,574
Right. Of course it's me. Jeez, let's eat.

456
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:25,243
How much did we drink?

457
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:27,662
Careful now.

458
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:33,501
Enjoy, everyone.

459
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:39,632
Eat.

460
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:42,593
-Thank you for the meal.
-Thanks for the meal.

461
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,310
It's been so long since I had this.

462
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,396
You guys nailed it.

463
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:05,116
It's huge.

464
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:06,784
The ceiling is fucking high.

465
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:08,703
Whoa, how many stories is this?

466
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:11,539
Thank you.

467
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:13,791
-Hello, everyone.
-You're here.

468
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:15,501
-Hello.
-Hello.

469
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:20,131
-Hello.
-Let me introduce my colleagues.

470
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:24,427
You do it.

471
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,222
I'm Sergeant Yoon Han-gu.
Nice to meet you.

472
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:30,975
Hello.

473
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:34,645
I'm Team Leader Kang Tae-yeong
from the Cybercrime Dept.

474
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:37,064
Let's keep my presence here a secret.
Nice to meet you.

475
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,274
-Okay.
-Nice to meet you.

476
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:42,486
Let's also keep my presence a secret.
We're all here in secret.

477
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:43,529
I see.

478
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:47,325
Anyway, Tae-yeong is the leading authority
in cybersecurity in the country.

479
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:50,661
She's going to brief you
on how to hack Kim's phone

480
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:51,871
and activate the safe.

481
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:53,748
Right. There are two ways.

482
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,416
The first one is Wi-Fi.

483
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:58,794
I'll install a small jammer
in the meeting room to cut off the signal,

484
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,671
temporarily blocking Internet access.

485
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:03,758
That will naturally lead Kim
to connect to Wi-Fi.

486
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:07,762
I'll be able to infiltrate the phone
once he connects to the transmitter.

487
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:10,056
Once I hack into his phone,
it's game over.

488
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:14,060
I've also done preliminary research
on safe apps that the suspect may use.

489
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:15,686
As for the second method,

490
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:18,356
we get the suspect to open
a more direct path for us.

491
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:21,901
You know how we scan personal QR codes
when entering buildings due to COVID?

492
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:25,321
We'll post the QR code that I made
at the entrance and make him scan it.

493
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:26,989
Once it's scanned into his phone,

494
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:29,367
that will grant me access
to hack his phone.

495
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,702
We'll use both methods simultaneously.

496
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:33,162
Hold on.

497
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:37,249
What do I have to do?

498
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:41,420
You need to ensure
that our suspect stays connected to Wi-Fi

499
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:42,838
for as long as possible.

500
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:46,050
I'll be accessing his cloud storage
to capture all the data,

501
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:48,552
but depending on the size,
it could take some time.

502
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:49,720
If we're lucky,

503
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:52,848
we'll be able to find evidence
of all of his crimes

504
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:54,308
and his accomplices to boot.

505
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,645
But what if…

506
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:00,898
that bastard catches on?

507
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:03,401
Do you have another plan?

508
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:09,156
We're proceeding with both options at once
to prevent that from happening.

509
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,993
No, that's not it! That's not…

510
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:20,251
It's only right that we get rid of
that hard drive tomorrow, no matter what.

511
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:23,587
I'd take his phone from him
if it were up to me.

512
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:25,589
It's simple. That shouldn't be so hard.

513
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,633
You're making it so complicated.

514
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:30,344
I'll take his phone.

515
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:31,887
Han-gu.

516
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:39,186
May I ask what's on the hard drive?

517
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,521
Damn it, seriously!

518
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:42,064
All right, you guys…

519
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:44,817
stay quiet.

520
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:46,777
Yes, sir.

521
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:52,908
Min-beom, a moment with me.

522
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:16,265
Min-beom.

523
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,226
You must be really anxious.

524
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:22,354
This is a pretty difficult operation.

525
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,357
Since it's unofficial,
there are limitations.

526
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:26,442
Gang-yong.

527
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:31,822
If I don't get rid of this drive,
I'll have to deal with Kim forever.

528
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:33,032
I'll be in big trouble.

529
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:35,451
That's why I am going to try my best.

530
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:37,661
Please put more faith in me.

531
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,044
All right.

532
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:09,777
There's no signal.

533
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:17,159
You're sure about this, right?

534
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:18,118
Of course.

535
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:58,951
Please measure your temperature.

536
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:03,080
Scan the QR code with your camera.

537
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:06,166
Shouldn't it be the other way around?

538
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,210
This is how our system works.

539
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,505
That's unusual. But okay.

540
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:21,390
It's working.

541
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,237
-Okay.
-Yes!

542
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:43,495
What? What is it?

543
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:45,205
There's nothing in his album.

544
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:46,457
Give me a second.

545
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:58,886
The safe app you mentioned is not here.

546
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:04,058
You guys heard it, right?

547
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:05,100
Yes.

548
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:07,603
Im Jang-do wasn't in a position to lie.

549
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:11,940
Is this asshole onto us?

550
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:22,076
Goodness!

551
00:44:23,118 --> 00:44:24,119
Director Hong!

552
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:27,706
How have you been?

553
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:51,397
Damn it.

554
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:54,858
What is it?

555
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:58,278
There's no safe app on his phone.

556
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:19,299
This asshole has two phones.

557
00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:21,927
What do you mean?

558
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:25,431
He scanned the code with a black phone,
but this one's silver.

559
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,435
What now?

560
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:31,395
We need to make him connect to Wi-Fi.

561
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:43,741
Mr. Min, he's coming here.

562
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:49,955
-Sir.
-No, it's fine.

563
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:51,915
-Do you need anything?
-No, it's fine.

564
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:01,216
How did it go?

565
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:03,594
Kim Myeong-gil has two phones.

566
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:05,763
We hacked one, but there's no safe app.

567
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:08,724
The phone with the app is in that pouch.

568
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:10,142
And?

569
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:12,853
We're working on it.

570
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:16,231
Gang-yong, we don't have time.
That's not going to take long.

571
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:21,278
Why don't we talk in private?

572
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:22,237
Damn it.

573
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:25,741
Tae-yeong, Han-gu.

574
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:28,035
Can you give us a moment?

575
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:29,495
Sure.

576
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:37,419
What did Im Jang-do use to take the video?

577
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:39,171
A cell phone.

578
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:42,216
Then wouldn't Im have sent the video
to Kim Myeong-gil's phone?

579
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:43,801
For confirmation?

580
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:45,052
Right.

581
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:49,473
Before you sign the contract,
tell him to delete the footage first.

582
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:52,184
Then he has no choice
but to take out his phone.

583
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:53,727
And what if he didn't send it?

584
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:55,646
What if Kim lies about it? Then what?

585
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:59,566
Ask him to show you
his chat history with Im Jang-do.

586
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:03,028
Tell him that Im Jang-do told you
that he was going to send it to his boss.

587
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:04,530
Man, seriously?

588
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:06,782
Criminals like Kim Myeong-gil
trust no one.

589
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:10,410
In order to verify
that Im Jang-do finished the job properly,

590
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:13,497
he must have asked him to send the video
after the job was done.

591
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:22,881
I don't think I can do it.

592
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:26,969
Trust me.

593
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:28,220
No, it's not that.

594
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:31,640
I don't think
I can stand up to Kim Myeong-gil.

595
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:36,770
I'm scared!

596
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:41,525
Fuck, just looking at him
makes my hands tremble!

597
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:49,116
Min-beom.

598
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:56,790
I believe you can do it.

599
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:01,503
I'll kick down those doors
and barge in if I sense trouble.

600
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:03,755
And if things get out of hand,

601
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:07,968
I'll use all of our family's resources
to protect you.

602
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:12,222
So muster up your courage this once.

603
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:21,273
We will jump in there with him, Min-beom.

604
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:22,941
You can do this.

605
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:45,839
You sure kept us waiting.

606
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:47,716
Where were you?

607
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:50,761
Would the lawyers step outside?

608
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:53,388
I need some privacy with Mr. Kim.

609
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:55,015
Sure.

610
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,697
Do you want to get arrested?

611
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:21,416
Where is this bravado coming from?

612
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:23,377
Before we sign the contract,

613
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:25,796
erase the footage.

614
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:29,049
It's at home.

615
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:33,804
I promise to immediately erase it at home
once we sign the contract.

616
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:37,099
Are you kidding me?

617
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:40,143
I know your guy sent it to your phone.

618
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:45,399
Erase it while I watch.

619
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:04,710
Wow.

620
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:25,063
-I'm erasing it now.
-No.

621
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:27,983
Let me erase it myself.

622
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:29,901
I don't trust you.

623
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:32,654
And if I refuse?

624
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:35,699
Then I'm not signing the contract.

625
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:38,326
You've totally lost it.

626
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:41,413
Hey.

627
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:46,209
You think my family will sit still
if you lay a finger on me?

628
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,254
I've been acting alone
out of embarrassment.

629
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:52,132
I wanted to resolve
this matter discretely.

630
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:54,426
Right.

631
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:57,054
My aunt's the director of the tax service.

632
00:50:57,137 --> 00:51:00,974
One phone call from me, and the next day,
your company will be audited.

633
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:02,100
How's that?

634
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:04,686
Would you like to pay
tens of billions in taxes?

635
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:06,855
Want to take this all the way to the end?

636
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:16,114
You've become an eloquent speaker.

637
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:19,201
Threatening me like this.

638
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:21,244
I learned from you.

639
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:26,374
I like it.

640
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:30,629
Well, I don't like it.

641
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:50,941
WI-FI OFF

642
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:52,734
WI-FI ON

643
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:57,906
We've got a signal.

644
00:51:58,490 --> 00:51:59,574
Give me a second.

645
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,291
We have the safe app.

646
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:11,336
-Okay!
-Hey, quiet.

647
00:52:12,003 --> 00:52:13,171
I'll open the safe now.

648
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:21,805
Will that be all, Director Hong?

649
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:24,808
Let's sign the contract.

650
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:38,405
Okay. Shall I proceed
with the incineration?

651
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,084
Okay.

652
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:52,169
Okay.

653
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:58,341
TOTAL INCINERATION IN PROCESS

654
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:12,230
It's done.

655
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:16,401
-Hey, it really worked, right?
-Yes, for sure.

656
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:19,696
-Oh, thank you.
-I'll extract the data first.

657
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:21,489
Extract it all.

658
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:25,327
Thanks to you all.

659
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:27,037
-Not at all.
-Not at all.

660
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,622
I'll gather all the evidence

661
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:31,666
and put that bastard behind bars,
so don't worry.

662
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:32,876
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

663
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:45,138
Nice work. Gang-yong will call you.

664
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:46,389
Okay, thank you.

665
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:47,474
Thank you.

666
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:49,684
This has been bugging me for a while, but…

667
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:52,270
For your cut, your scar.

668
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:54,981
I'd like to help you get treatment.

669
00:53:56,608 --> 00:54:00,445
Well, I really appreciate it,
but I'm okay.

670
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:01,988
Are you sure?

671
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:02,906
Yes.

672
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:07,994
Thanks to this scar, I was able to meet
a lot of amazing people.

673
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:11,498
It gave me the strength
to carry on instead of giving up.

674
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:13,250
So,

675
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:16,169
I'm okay with this scar.

676
00:54:17,003 --> 00:54:17,921
I understand.

677
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:20,048
See you soon.

678
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:21,758
-Okay.
-Okay.

679
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:23,718
Take care of them.

680
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:24,928
-Yes.
-I won't go far.

681
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:26,179
Okay, thank you.

682
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:27,222
Have a nice day.

683
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:33,019
-I'm relieved it ended well.
-I know, right?

684
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:37,816
-I knew things would go well.
-Yes.

685
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,695
-Right, Gun-woo.
-Yes?

686
00:54:42,195 --> 00:54:46,992
Do you remember when Mr. Choi asked
Im Jang-do about the gold bars?

687
00:54:47,492 --> 00:54:50,954
Yes, about how only In-beom knows
where they are?

688
00:54:51,037 --> 00:54:51,871
Yes.

689
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:53,456
How much do you think that is?

690
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:55,834
I don't know.

691
00:54:56,876 --> 00:54:59,212
My guess is tens of billions.

692
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:01,840
Well…

693
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:06,136
That includes the money
he stole from Mr. Choi, right?

694
00:55:06,219 --> 00:55:07,053
Right.

695
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:09,973
If the cops don't catch Kim Myeong-gil,

696
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:14,894
he's going to take the money and gold
and hightail it overseas.

697
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:18,815
We can't let that happen.
That money belongs to Mr. Choi.

698
00:55:19,607 --> 00:55:20,483
Let's get ready.

699
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:23,361
Let's chase him down
and maul him to death.

700
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:24,988
Sounds good.

701
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:35,081
-Let's drink until we die tonight!
-Nice!

702
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:38,293
-Beom, Jun-min, good work!
-Sir!

703
00:55:38,376 --> 00:55:41,338
All right, let's go
for round two at my place!

704
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:44,758
What is it?

705
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:46,885
Don't you smell something?

706
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:49,012
Eun-seo, what's wrong?

707
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:52,182
Well, I guess it does smell like smoke.

708
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:55,477
Hey, quiet down.

709
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:00,273
Don't.

710
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:20,335
Fuck!

711
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:29,344
Go back.

712
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:39,938
CHOI TAE-HO

713
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:00,667
-Where are you?
-Working overtime, sir.

714
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:03,878
I'll send a driver with a phone right now.

715
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:05,964
Find someone for me.

716
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:07,382
How many people?

717
00:57:07,465 --> 00:57:09,050
For starters, an old man.

718
00:57:09,634 --> 00:57:10,844
Is this urgent?

719
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:12,679
If you find him by noon tomorrow,

720
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:15,098
I'll pay you triple.

721
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:17,725
Yes, sir.

722
