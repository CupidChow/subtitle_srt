00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:13,179
DECEMBER 2020

2
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:16,933
JINNAM BOXING

3
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:28,463
Oh, sir.

4
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:30,048
You need to wear a mask.

5
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:31,257
Sure. Let's go.

6
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,635
You need to wear a mask to get on the bus.

7
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:34,594
Let's go.

8
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:36,638
Now get off, put on a mask, and come back.

9
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:38,473
How dare you tell me what to do!

10
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:41,601
-We get penalized--
-What about my mask? That's up to me!

11
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:44,229
-Don't tell me what to do. Damn it!
-Hey.

12
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:47,190
Just focus on your driving.
You're just a bus driver!

13
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,108
Damn it.

14
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:50,443
Please put on a mask and come back, sir.

15
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,070
-Come here!
-Don't do this, sir.

16
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:54,781
-There are passengers on board.
-Let go! What the hell?

17
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:56,574
-Let me go, you punk!
-Whoa!

18
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,785
-Let go, damn it.
-I'm sorry.

19
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:00,453
Who the hell are you?

20
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:03,081
I'm sorry.
I think you'll have to walk home.

21
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:06,126
-You little!
-Whoa, I am sorry.

22
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,335
You piece of shit!

23
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:09,212
-Sorry, sir.
-Hey!

24
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,171
I'm so sorry.

25
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,841
Whoa, I'm sorry.

26
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,467
Don't hurt yourself. I'm sorry.

27
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:15,802
Damn it!

28
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:18,930
Damn you!

29
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:20,849
I am sorry.

30
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:22,642
This is so annoying, damn it.

31
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:25,687
I'm sorry, sir.

32
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:26,938
Sorry, my ass.

33
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:30,483
Darn it.

34
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:33,111
Sorry about that.

35
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:35,029
-Thank you, sir.
-Not a problem.

36
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,575
Thanks to you…

37
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,160
You were so cool.

38
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:23,661
I'm really sorry.

39
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:27,123
I had no idea it would go on
for this long either.

40
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,086
I am so sorry for bringing this up.

41
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,756
I'll do whatever I can by next month.

42
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,719
So, can you wait just one month?

43
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:42,972
I'll pay you back, no matter what.

44
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:46,726
Yes, I'll figure it out by next month.

45
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:48,478
Okay, thank you.

46
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:30,895
BLOODHOUNDS

47
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:37,026
Amidst the economic downturn
due to COVID-19,

48
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:41,072
a suspended construction project
threatens the safety of the citizens.

49
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:44,659
Construction on this building
has been suspended twice

50
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:46,786
due to a worker's positive COVID-19 test.

51
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:49,580
The construction company
eventually went bankrupt,

52
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:52,292
leaving this building an eyesore
for four months.

53
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,752
Seoul must act quickly
to resolve this situation.

54
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:05,179
In the United States, over 3.5 million
hotel employees were laid off

55
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,681
in the third quarter alone.

56
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:09,600
I'm saying that for at least
the next three to four years,

57
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:12,603
no foreign company will look
into acquiring this hotel.

58
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:15,857
-Even less for domestic companies.
-You make claims as if they're true.

59
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,026
I have many friends
that will become the future leaders

60
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,652
of Korea's top fifty corporations.

61
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,822
I have thoroughly discussed it
with them and reached this conclusion,

62
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:24,449
so these claims are somewhat true.

63
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,159
Actually,

64
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,536
they are true facts.

65
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:31,956
You're right to negotiate with me,
Mr. Vice President.

66
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,915
Director Hong.

67
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:37,337
Our bank has lent
400 billion won for this building.

68
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,715
Saying you will only pay back
300 billion isn't a negotiation.

69
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:43,176
Shouldn't you bear
some loss in this situation?

70
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,053
How else do you do business?

71
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,013
I am not a businessman

72
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:48,723
but a banker.

73
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:51,476
Well, Mr. Director and Mr. Vice President,

74
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:53,811
the reason I gathered
the two of you here--

75
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:54,729
Yes.

76
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:58,024
The mayor wants the building
to be completed as soon as possible

77
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:59,400
for the citizens' safety.

78
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,361
But it's like talking to a brick wall!

79
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:04,697
Are you calling me a brick wall,
Mr. Vice President?

80
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:07,116
Just what part of what you said
is reasonable?

81
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,293
I must apologize for being late.

82
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:21,714
This is CEO Kim Myeong-gil,
who I mentioned before the meal.

83
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,257
Please welcome him.

84
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:26,928
Assemblyman Seo Woo-hyeon,
a close acquaintance of the mayor,

85
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,596
introduced him to us.

86
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:30,598
I'm Kim Myeong-gil.

87
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,852
KIM MYEONG-GIL

88
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,814
I'll personally call you later.

89
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,273
Okay.

90
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,029
I'm Kim Myeong-gil.

91
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:58,126
May I ask what kind of work
you do exactly?

92
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,878
I mainly deal in investments.

93
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:05,258
When good people ask for me,
I help them to the best of my abilities.

94
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,052
Wait. Do you run a loan business?

95
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:12,223
Hold on. You brought a loan shark here?

96
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,476
Mr. Kim dabbles in various businesses.

97
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,020
This isn't a place
for a loan shark, is it?

98
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:23,109
You must be Chairman Hong Woo-geun's
eldest son.

99
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,447
When I was young, I worked
for Chairman Bang in Myeong-dong.

100
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,575
You would not remember this
since you were a baby back then.

101
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:32,785
When the IMF crisis hit Korea,

102
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:35,788
Iil Group, a fifty-year-old company,
nearly went bankrupt

103
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,498
because they didn't have six billion won.

104
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,168
Back then, Chairman Hong Woo-geun

105
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:43,463
visited my boss,
Chairman Bang, asking for help.

106
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:47,550
He got down on his knees, saying that
he had to save the company at all costs.

107
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:51,762
Chairman Bang was moved
by his passion and sincerity.

108
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:57,852
I filled a bag with six billion won
in cash and went to your house.

109
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,688
I recall your mother preparing

110
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:03,733
refreshing Korean melons for me
to express her gratitude.

111
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:08,070
Dirty money doesn't exist.
It may be used for nefarious reasons,

112
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,740
but when used for good,
that makes it good money.

113
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,202
I came here to help.

114
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:20,458
If you'd tell me where we are
in the negotiations…

115
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,878
Each of them had
different amounts in mind.

116
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:27,215
-We were discussing that.
-I see. How much are we talking?

117
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,883
A hundred billion won.

118
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:36,599
Do you plan on overseeing
hotel operations yourself, Mr. Hong?

119
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:39,852
I got my master's degree
in hotel management in Switzerland

120
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,437
and worked for 4 years in Hong Kong.

121
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,648
I see. You are well-prepared.

122
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,444
With your permission,
I'd like to make an investment.

123
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:51,239
How much?

124
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:55,785
Well, since you are 100 billion short,
I should invest that much.

125
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,124
I will invest more if you need.

126
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,167
And your terms?

127
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:05,920
There are only three things.

128
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:12,176
Firstly, I would like a small casino built
on the top floor of the hotel.

129
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,804
Just as you dream of managing a hotel,

130
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,431
I dream of opening a casino.

131
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:23,563
Secondly, please help me
set up a small bar in the hotel basement.

132
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:27,358
Lastly, should something like COVID-19
spread again at a later time,

133
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:30,820
please open up our hotel
as a quarantine space

134
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,406
for those without money, free of charge.

135
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:38,494
The harder the times,
the more we should care for each other.

136
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,747
That is how we make a better world.

137
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,712
I am ready

138
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,965
to make my 100 billion investment
as early as tomorrow.

139
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,566
Did it go well?

140
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,819
-Yeah.
-You think they'll take the bait?

141
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:15,740
-Yeah.
-All right!

142
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:20,286
Nice! I guess I just need
to worry about how to decorate the bar.

143
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,913
People don't go to bars
to admire the interior design.

144
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,540
They go to see the girls.

145
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,043
You should get busy
recruiting plenty of pretty girls.

146
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,128
You get busy, you fucker.

147
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:32,214
It'd be nice if someone
as pretty as you could talk nicely too.

148
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,884
What would you know? You prick!

149
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,013
I want to wipe my face.

150
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:40,431
Right.

151
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:44,226
Here.

152
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:00,785
Drive.

153
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,707
What about the Seongeun building?

154
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:10,002
None of the tenants have any ties
to the police or prosecutor's office.

155
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,379
Including their in-laws?

156
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:14,340
Sir, I overlooked that just that one time.

157
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:16,550
One of their lovers might be a cop.

158
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,552
Do your job right, so he doesn't worry.

159
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,930
Jesus, you worry about yourself.

160
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,098
Jang-do,

161
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,601
you should talk respectfully
to your sister-in-law.

162
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:28,604
Yes, I'm sorry, sir.

163
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,606
Apologize to me, you stupid prick!

164
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,734
This prick apologizes, ma'am.

165
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:36,487
Let's hurry up.
I could really use a drink.

166
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,405
Yes, sir.

167
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:43,536
This is the 2020 KBFC
Rookie of the Year Tournament.

168
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:45,663
The arena should be filled
with cheering fans

169
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:48,290
showing their support,
but due to the COVID-19 pandemic,

170
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,918
it is being held without any spectators.

171
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,378
The atmosphere feels gloomy.

172
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:54,797
Yes. The tournament
normally has a lot of cheering

173
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,008
for everyone involved,
but things are quiet right now.

174
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:01,303
As we speak, we begin
the third round of Hong Woo-jin's match.

175
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,972
It's a middleweight match.

176
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,598
Hong Woo-jin is in the red trunks,

177
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,684
against Jung Jae-hun in the blue trunks.

178
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:07,601
Get in there.

179
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,562
-Great combination of body shots.
-Yes.

180
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:10,980
Hong leans against the ropes.

181
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,733
He provokes his opponent
after landing body shots.

182
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:16,277
Wow, that is right.
He's showing composure.

183
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,903
-"Hit me if you can."
-Yes.

184
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,321
"You can certainly…"

185
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,239
Whoa, a body shot!

186
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:21,157
There you go.

187
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,285
-A clean hit to the body.
-And he just landed a blow to the face!

188
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:26,537
He knocks his opponent down! Hong Woo-jin!

189
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,039
Whoa, that double right
followed by a one-two combo.

190
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:31,959
Yes, look at that footwork.
He has great showmanship.

191
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:33,294
Whoa, it's a KO.

192
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:37,465
Next, we have Kim Gun-woo
going up against Kim Rae-hyeon.

193
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,550
We have super rookie Kim Gun-woo in blue.

194
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:42,511
Kim Gun-woo is looking
for a chance with his guard up.

195
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:43,512
Nice!

196
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,556
-A body blow!
-He goes down on his knees!

197
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:48,142
That's right.
A precision blow to the solar plexus…

198
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:50,186
-And that is the end of the match.
-Indeed.

199
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,729
That one blow ended the match.

200
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:54,940
Kim Gun-woo continues to mow down
his opponents with a single blow.

201
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,400
-He is a flawless boxer.
-Nice job.

202
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,068
A terrifying rookie has emerged.

203
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:00,446
Things are already getting heated.

204
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,740
-He's cornered.
-He's getting cornered.

205
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:08,245
He grabs him and throws him over.
He just threw his opponent down.

206
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,872
That was a foul.

207
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,665
-That's right.
-He did it first…

208
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,375
-He's too agitated.
-Right.

209
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,044
-Box!
-Let's do this!

210
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:18,297
How he parts his hair.
Hong's showmanship is unmatched.

211
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,257
-I agree.
-He provokes his opponent first.

212
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:21,342
He dodges.

213
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,260
Whoa, look at him dodge!

214
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,807
And again.
He connects! We have a knockout!

215
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,850
That is Hong Woo-jin's specialty.

216
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,144
-Right.
-A double jab followed by a straight!

217
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,979
Hong Woo-jin, the Marine.

218
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,398
Hong Woo-jin advances yet again.

219
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,860
Now, a match between
Kim Gun-woo and Lee Yong-gyu.

220
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,365
Kim Gun-woo in the red trunks
is built like a tank.

221
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:45,783
-That's right.
-Nice dodge.

222
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:48,452
-Kim Gun-woo's strength is in infighting.
-Right.

223
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,372
He is leveraging
his infighting skills well.

224
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:53,541
Another punch, and he dodges.

225
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:56,836
-Body shot!
-He brings him down with one blow again!

226
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,088
-Yes, a left hook to the body.
-Yes.

227
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,382
I also had that level of talent
back in the day.

228
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:03,551
-Are you all right?
-Yeah.

229
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:06,053
-That's why you won a gold medal.
-That is true.

230
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,514
Now, Kim Gun-woo versus Hong Woo-jin.

231
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:11,267
-All right.
-Let's find out who takes home the trophy.

232
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,019
No big moves.
Short punches. Use your waist!

233
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,856
Watch out for his left hook.
His punches are no joke.

234
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:26,240
Hey, I'm a Marine.

235
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,492
Watch out for his left hook.

236
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,911
I'm an invincible Marine. Invincible!

237
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:34,081
If he beats the shit out of you
and you cry, I'm going to kill you.

238
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,254
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

239
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,801
Good luck to you both. To your corners.

240
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,891
His fighting so far has been marvelous.

241
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:55,686
Kim Gun-woo, the super rookie,
has a very different fighting style.

242
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:59,440
That's right. Kim Gun-woo is an infighter
who's good against other infighters.

243
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:00,983
Right.

244
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:06,030
On the other hand, Hong Woo-jin is
an out boxer with a counter up his sleeve.

245
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:09,116
That's right, Hong Woo-jin knows
how to have fun in his matches.

246
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,034
Right.

247
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:13,037
Meanwhile, his opponent,
who stoically plays it by the book…

248
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,831
He's going in! He's cornering him!

249
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,500
Can Hong Woo-jin get out?
Can he get out of this?

250
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,002
He got out of that really well.

251
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:24,131
-Yes, Hong Woo-jin is really fast.
-That's right.

252
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,425
Since Kim Gun-woo is also a middleweight--

253
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,594
And now he goes for a wild swing!

254
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,055
-Yes.
-Blocked that. Body blows.

255
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:33,015
Kim Gun-woo has a great defense.

256
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,351
-Yes.
-He's like a solid rock.

257
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,770
He keeps his guard up.

258
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:38,687
Uppercut!

259
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,481
-There we go.
-He landed that one.

260
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:42,149
Yes, indeed.

261
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,484
What a performance this is.

262
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:44,902
A right hook! What a dodge.

263
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,862
Now it's Hong Woo-jin's turn.

264
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:50,074
Hong Woo-jin is
constantly applying pressure.

265
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,827
-Another left hook to the body!
-A left hook. Can he recover?

266
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,996
-He goes down.
-He's down!

267
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,039
He's down.

268
00:15:57,706 --> 00:16:01,085
Yes, when it comes to stomach blows,
the shock does not immediately set in.

269
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:03,712
-Right.
-It takes around five seconds.

270
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:04,797
Get up! Woo-jin!

271
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,340
Six, seven…

272
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:07,967
-He's up in five seconds.
-Right.

273
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,802
-He recovered from that well.
-He did…

274
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:10,803
Yes.

275
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:12,930
But that has definitely got to sting.

276
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:15,307
-There's going to be an aftereffect.
-Right.

277
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,060
Come on.

278
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,606
Come on!

279
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,008
Come on.

280
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,052
Hey, come and get some.

281
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,472
You son of a bitch.

282
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,893
I said come on!

283
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,105
Will he take the bait?

284
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,357
-Kim Gun-woo has a lot to think about.
-Come on!

285
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,735
And there he goes! Will he connect?

286
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:11,155
Stop! One, two…

287
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:13,574
It must have done significant damage.

288
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:15,409
His tactics really backfired.

289
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:16,410
That's correct.

290
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:19,121
Kim Gun-woo went in for the kill
and ended the match

291
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:24,293
once again with the same body blow.

292
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,590
Are you all right?

293
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:32,843
I have stained the honor of the Marines.

294
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,512
Everyone goes down
after a blow to the liver.

295
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:37,639
I'm leaving.

296
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,892
Aren't we gonna eat?

297
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:41,810
There's COVID-19 going on.

298
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:45,564
I've just gone through a lot.
The least you can do is feed me.

299
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:02,915
Go home and order takeout.

300
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:06,960
See you.

301
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,853
What? Why? What?

302
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:26,855
Shall we go eat?

303
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,274
Why would I eat with you?

304
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:32,861
I was going to have pork belly.
I thought we could eat together.

305
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:36,573
Are you pitying me?

306
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:37,991
No.

307
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:40,202
Go ask those other bastards you KO'd.

308
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,912
They all went home.

309
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,248
Damn it.

310
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:59,304
-Isn't the prize money ten million won?
-Yes.

311
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:03,392
Then why eat pork belly?
Let's get some rib eye.

312
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:06,145
-I'm only going to spend 50,000 won.
-Why?

313
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,980
I need to give the rest to my mom.

314
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:10,107
-Do you owe your mom money?
-No.

315
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,066
Then why?

316
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,527
I have to pay the rent for her café.

317
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:15,404
You're a good son.

318
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,614
Spend an additional 10,000 won.

319
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:20,284
There's a barbecue buffet
that charges 29,000 won per person.

320
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,035
Top quality. They have Korean beef.

321
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,204
-Really? Where?
-I'm kidding, you chump.

322
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,916
How can they afford
to serve Korean beef for 29,000 won?

323
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,294
Have you spent
your entire life just boxing?

324
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:33,881
That buffet is all right.
Just spend 10,000 won more.

325
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:34,798
No.

326
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,135
Hey.

327
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:48,896
Let's go.

328
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,940
How is your left hook so strong?

329
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:56,028
I practiced on a tire
when I worked part-time at a junkyard.

330
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:57,279
Just your left hook?

331
00:19:58,488 --> 00:19:59,781
Why only work on my left hook?

332
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,867
I'm asking
if you only worked on your left.

333
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,785
I practiced both.

334
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,537
Then how's your left so strong?

335
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:08,874
-My right hand is stronger.
-Then why did you only use your left?

336
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:11,293
I couldn't find the right timing
for my right.

337
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:13,545
What a show-off.

338
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:15,422
How so?

339
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:18,258
You're saying you could take
everyone down with your left.

340
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,468
Today, yes.

341
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,386
See? You are a show-off.

342
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,306
-No, I'm totally humble.
-Just flip the meat.

343
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,308
We have to give it another 30 seconds.

344
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,143
You can flip it right now.

345
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:31,355
No, I worked part-time
at a barbecue place. I know my meat.

346
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,607
Jeez. You sure
worked a lot of part-time jobs.

347
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:37,069
-Are you poor?
-Yes, our family went broke.

348
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:40,405
How?

349
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:45,244
My dad was a researcher
for a large corporation.

350
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:48,455
He sued for wrongful termination
but lost four years later.

351
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:51,250
The legal fees
from back then turned into debt.

352
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,753
You can't beat the big companies.
The rich always win.

353
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:55,879
That's true.

354
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:01,551
-What else did you do part-time?
-All sorts of things.

355
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,553
But I mostly went on
delivery runs with my mom.

356
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:06,848
You're a world-class part-timer.

357
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,018
Whoa.

358
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:13,021
You're good at everything.
You've led a good life.

359
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,107
I see you grill right handed.

360
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,567
When did you start boxing?

361
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,195
About three years ago.

362
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,281
-When was that?
-After my military service.

363
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:23,407
I see.

364
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:26,243
I first put on boxing gloves
in sixth grade.

365
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:27,995
My dad was on the national team.

366
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:31,540
That is awesome. What is your dad's name?

367
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:34,501
Hong Seong-geun.
The Barcelona Olympics Bronze medalist.

368
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:36,169
-I see.
-Do you know him?

369
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,379
No.

370
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,048
Most boxers seem to know him.

371
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,134
I see. Sorry.

372
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:45,429
Did your dad teach you how to box?

373
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:48,765
-I'm not that close to my dad.
-Why not?

374
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,643
My dad is never satisfied
with anything I do.

375
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:56,481
He won his bronze medal at my age and
judges me based on his accomplishments.

376
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:04,948
Then did your dad win
that bronze medal when he was twenty-five?

377
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:07,617
No, twenty-seven.

378
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,247
How old are you?

379
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,041
Twenty-seven.

380
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:16,668
Well, I apologize, then.

381
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,879
I'm twenty-five. I am so sorry.

382
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:20,756
Jeez. You little bastard.

383
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:21,673
Forgive me.

384
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:22,799
-Hey.
-Yes?

385
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,593
Behave from now on, okay?

386
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:25,927
-Will do.
-Got it?

387
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,304
Yes.

388
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:28,889
Flip it.

389
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:31,266
No, it still needs a minute.

390
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,435
-It's fine. Flip it!
-I can't do that.

391
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:37,147
Jeez! You're one stubborn punk.
Have you served in the army yet?

392
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:40,192
Yes, I told you I started boxing
after I finished my service.

393
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:41,568
I know.

394
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:43,987
What I'm asking is,
where were you stationed?

395
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:47,240
-You should catch on quicker.
-I was in the Marine Corps.

396
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,451
Hey!

397
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,578
I am a Marine too!

398
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:52,579
I see.

399
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:53,872
What class were you in?

400
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:56,041
I was in the 1,207th class.

401
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:01,004
Salute! I was in the 1,216th class, sir!

402
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:03,840
What are you doing? Please sit.

403
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,927
-I will sit when you return my salute.
-Right. Well…

404
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:11,973
Marine Kim Gun-woo, sir.

405
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,767
-Yes?
-Where did you serve, sir?

406
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,227
The First Division.

407
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,229
Me too! Which battalion were you in, sir?

408
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:20,732
-Reconnaissance.
-Amazing.

409
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,361
I wanted to get into reconnaissance,
but I didn't make the cut.

410
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:27,072
-I see.
-The pride of the Marines, recon.

411
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:28,448
Recon!

412
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:33,453
I'll call you bro,
so let's just speak casually.

413
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:35,622
I understand, sir.

414
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:36,998
Let's be casual.

415
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,542
Casual it is, sir.

416
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:39,584
Brother.

417
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:41,878
Here.

418
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:49,219
I have a crazy amount
of pride as a Marine.

419
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:50,137
Why?

420
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,722
I used to be a bit of a thug in Incheon,

421
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:55,725
but I joined the Marine Corps
and met some really nice people.

422
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,185
Now I've finally come to my senses.

423
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:01,440
I loved training and overcoming
all the difficulties together.

424
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:02,774
This looks delicious.

425
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:05,360
Waking up in the morning,
going on runs, sweating,

426
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:06,987
showering and washing each other.

427
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,738
-Woo-jin.
-Yes?

428
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,451
-Are you one of those crazy Marines?
-Of course not.

429
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:13,702
Try this.

430
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,247
How is it?

431
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,126
It's practically steak.

432
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:22,043
Really?

433
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:24,754
Check this out.

434
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:27,215
-Three pieces.
-Whoa, yes.

435
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,259
-With some ssamjang.
-Yes.

436
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:30,677
And kimchi with that too?

437
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:37,017
-Marine Kim Gun-woo, sir.
-Yes?

438
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,064
-It's amazing, isn't it?
-Yes.

439
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:44,983
-Do you want some soju?
-No.

440
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:46,943
-Why? Because of your diet?
-Yes.

441
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:49,237
You perfectionist. So annoying.

442
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:52,616
Excuse me!

443
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:55,744
A bottle of beer and soju, please!

444
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:59,080
How much did your shoes cost?

445
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:00,999
-1,200,000 won.
-Really?

446
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,127
Why so expensive?
That's rent for our café.

447
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:05,795
How are you so gullible?

448
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:07,506
They're knockoffs.

449
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,133
They look real.

450
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:12,802
Knockoffs have shiny toe caps.

451
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:15,972
The real ones are suede.
The finishing on the holes is shoddy too.

452
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:19,601
I can find one for you
that's better than the real deal.

453
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,853
-Really?
-I can't believe this guy.

454
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:25,106
Nothing in this world tops the real deal.

455
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:28,818
You should hang out with me
and learn about the world.

456
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:31,196
I think you've been working too much.

457
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:36,117
Do you know about this?
I hear it's very common nowadays.

458
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:39,329
"COVID-19 special loans."

459
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:43,833
Back then, I was strapped for cash,
so I worked in the money-lending business.

460
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:47,587
-Yes.
-Desperate people are easier to rip off.

461
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,965
The pandemic has made
a lot of people desperate.

462
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:55,887
-The loan sharks are so damn excited.
-How come?

463
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:58,807
Since everyone is rushing over
to cover their rent,

464
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:02,686
all they need to do
is sit still and suck them dry.

465
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:06,565
My mom is having a hard time
because of the rent at the café.

466
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:09,859
The café makes less than a quarter
of what it used to,

467
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:12,153
but the landlord still takes
the same amount of rent.

468
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:16,199
If we close down now,
it would cost us more to move out.

469
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:17,826
So we're just holding on.

470
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:20,537
They say we need to restore it
to its original state.

471
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:23,206
Damn.

472
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:27,627
Here.

473
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:32,257
I will treat you
to something real fancy next time.

474
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,134
Rib eye?

475
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:36,970
There is a butcher's shop
and barbecue place.

476
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:38,305
You're not lying, are you?

477
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:42,934
Do you think I'd tell a senior Marine
such a low-level fib?

478
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,395
-I think you totally would.
-You don't believe me?

479
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:47,897
You kept lying to me earlier.

480
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:50,775
Jeez. That was a joke, you fool.

481
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,569
All right, no more lies going forward.

482
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:54,696
Deal.

483
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:59,075
I am so sorry.

484
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:02,621
I should've prepared it this month,

485
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,748
but I was not able to.

486
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:09,794
Yes, I'll try to figure something out
after this month.

487
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,213
I am sorry.

488
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,967
-Sorry, let me call you back.
-Mom.

489
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,302
I'll call in the morning.

490
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,596
My son!

491
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,931
Oh my God!

492
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,935
You were amazing today!

493
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:28,480
-You watched it?
-Of course I did.

494
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:30,857
The commentators complimented you so much.

495
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,777
-Really?
-Yes, they said you were flawless.

496
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,236
Then I should watch it too.

497
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,739
-Mom, hold on.
-Yes.

498
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,157
I am so proud of you.

499
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,326
Here.

500
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:43,161
What is this?

501
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,997
The prize money. Pay your rent with it.

502
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,417
Jeez.

503
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:51,836
I can't take this.

504
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:55,423
No, I won this to give to you.

505
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:02,389
Let's pay off the money
we borrowed from Uncle first.

506
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:03,348
What?

507
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:06,601
How do you know about that?

508
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:09,979
Uncle is having a hard time too.
Let's hurry and pay him back.

509
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:15,568
Okay.

510
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:19,489
I'll make sure
to pay you back with interest.

511
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:22,575
-Okay.
-Thank you.

512
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:27,414
Let's go, Mom.

513
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:29,082
Jeez, it's so cold. Let's go.

514
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:31,292
Did you eat?

515
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,335
Yes, of course.

516
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:33,795
With who?

517
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,548
The guy I fought in the finals.

518
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:40,802
The boy with the curly hair?

519
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:41,845
Yes, him.

520
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,056
Mom, did you eat?

521
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,516
Yes, I ate too.

522
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:06,035
Sir.

523
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:07,537
How are things?

524
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:11,750
All tenants owe money to banks
or second-tier financial companies,

525
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:12,834
as you said, sir.

526
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:16,629
I will bring them all
to our company next week.

527
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:19,549
Can you make it happen this week?

528
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,969
Assemblyman Seo keeps badgering me
to kick them out fast.

529
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:25,513
I'll get it done, sir.

530
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,724
Yes, let's hurry things up.

531
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:30,268
Jun-min, the sales team
is the most important.

532
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:31,895
Yes, sir.

533
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:37,567
Beom.

534
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:40,612
Let's get ready.

535
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:03,301
I'm the team manager, Yoo In-yeong,
from Smile Capital.

536
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:05,595
We are a financial company

537
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:07,806
that has been government-certified
for excellence.

538
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:12,143
-Do you have a moment to talk?
-Sure.

539
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:15,897
There haven't been
many customers here lately, right?

540
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:18,316
No.

541
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:21,152
Sir, you have a bank loan
of 40 million won, right?

542
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:22,612
Yes.

543
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:27,075
Once you sign here,
we will pay off that debt today.

544
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:31,412
We have a 5% interest rate,
which is lower than the bank's 7%.

545
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:34,374
Then, how do you turn a profit?

546
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:35,416
Well, that's true.

547
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,962
But the government has started
a special support program

548
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:43,091
to help small business owners
who are struggling from the pandemic.

549
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:47,136
We won the bid for the support package,
which lets us lower our interest rates.

550
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:50,098
A 2% interest rate is not a small amount.

551
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:53,768
In times like this,
you win if you hold out.

552
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:58,189
COVID-19? This too shall pass.

553
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:02,777
We'd like to help
so you can continue running your business.

554
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,031
This is good for us,

555
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,325
but it's beneficial for you too, sir.

556
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,831
-Thank you.
-I should be the one thanking you.

557
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:16,332
SMILE CAPITAL
SIGNEE YOON SO-YEON

558
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:22,881
SPARK BOXING GYM

559
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:33,516
What?

560
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,018
TEMPORARILY CLOSED

561
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:38,897
Some members at the gym
ordered some fried chicken last night.

562
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,357
Apparently, one of them tested positive.

563
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:44,152
Should I get tested too?

564
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:45,486
You're fine.

565
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:50,074
Anyway, your match was just yesterday.
Why did you come to the gym?

566
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:52,535
-To work out.
-Gun-woo.

567
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:54,329
Take a week off.

568
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:56,205
And do what?

569
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:58,499
You're not resting
if you're doing something.

570
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,752
Don't do anything and just rest.

571
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:02,337
Okay.

572
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:15,183
GU-NOO

573
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,525
Hey, what are you up to?

574
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,528
Sleeping.

575
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:28,655
What?

576
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:30,031
Sleeping.

577
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,241
I can't hear you.

578
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:33,576
I said I'm sleeping.

579
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,954
I am sleeping.

580
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,414
Do you want to work out?

581
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,291
No.

582
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:42,126
I'm bored.

583
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:45,380
Jeez. You're so clingy
early in the morning.

584
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,382
Come on. Let's hang out.

585
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:52,720
I'll send you my address. Come over.

586
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:54,555
Okay.

587
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,031
Fuck!

588
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:14,617
Damn it! Stop!

589
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:16,452
You son of a bitch!

590
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:03,416
Are you all right?

591
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,251
Hey…

592
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:33,529
What?

593
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:36,324
Why did you follow me?

594
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:38,242
Who sent you?

595
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,538
To help.

596
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:44,957
What? Help who?

597
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:49,796
I thought that man was being chased…

598
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:52,840
-Fuck!
-What?

599
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,717
That bastard is an imposter.

600
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,636
-What?
-Mind your own business.

601
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,347
-Okay.
-This fucker, seriously.

602
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:05,937
What the…

603
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:36,092
What brings you here?

604
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:40,138
Mi-yeon's surgery went well yesterday.

605
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:42,390
Is that so? And how is she now?

606
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:46,018
Good. She's recovering well.

607
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:49,939
It's all thanks to you, sir.

608
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:52,608
If you hadn't helped us,

609
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:56,237
Mi-yeon might've died.

610
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:00,158
Here.

611
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:05,121
Luckily, my husband moved
to a big company recently,

612
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:07,373
so he received his severance.

613
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:11,669
I came here
as soon as we received the money

614
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:14,130
because I wanted to pay you back
before anyone else.

615
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,802
You can take your time paying me back.

616
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:22,263
Pay off your urgent debts first.

617
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:26,475
No, sir. Please accept this.

618
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:29,437
I feel a little at ease now.

619
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:33,941
Thank you, sir.

620
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:38,362
Thank you so much.

621
00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:42,241
Thank you.

622
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,927
MI-YEON'S MOTHER APRIL 14TH, 2018
20 MILLION WON

623
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:10,728
KOREAN ANTIQUE MALL

624
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:36,629
I found that bastard, Yang Jae-myeong,
but he started bitching about being broke,

625
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:38,005
so I took this from him.

626
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:43,928
This is worth over 20 million won.

627
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:45,054
So what?

628
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:48,057
Yang Jae-myeong borrowed ten million won.

629
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,101
We got paid with interest.

630
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:57,191
Did you get hurt?

631
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,735
Fuck. I got in a scuffle
with Yang Jae-myeong.

632
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:04,448
By the way, we should talk.

633
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:05,783
Have some rice cakes.

634
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:09,036
Don't change the subject with rice cakes.

635
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:12,999
How long are you going to do this?

636
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:15,251
Do what?

637
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:19,213
Lend people money with no interest.

638
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,965
It's not profitable.

639
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:22,633
What do you mean?

640
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:25,845
I always pay you 30% in commission fees.

641
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:28,097
Not for me. I mean for you, Grandpa.

642
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:33,644
You know Mi-yeon's mom, right?

643
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:35,771
Yes, why?

644
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:39,358
She dropped by earlier
and paid back everything in cash.

645
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:42,611
And that's the interest payment?

646
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:45,531
Hyeon-ju.

647
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,909
A sick child received a timely operation
and regained her health.

648
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,619
Because I lent the family money,

649
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:53,664
they didn't have to use their home
as collateral and get a loan.

650
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:57,168
Thanks to that, the child has a home
to return to once she's discharged.

651
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,504
We saved a family.

652
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:04,633
This is the most valuable form of interest
in the world.

653
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:08,721
Jeez.

654
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:12,808
Anyway, I heard this while digging around
for Yang Jae-myeong's whereabouts.

655
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:16,437
Yang Jae-myeong and his posse
are going around dressed up as homeless

656
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,357
and stealing the real homeless' IDs
to take out loans in their names.

657
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,983
What kind of people are they?

658
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:24,403
They were in prison with Yang Jae-myeong.
A bunch of thugs.

659
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:26,447
You knew that, and you still went alone?

660
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:28,991
Do you want to tag along next time?

661
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:34,080
Anyway, let me do some digging.
I think I'll find something interesting.

662
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:35,998
Don't get involved in anything dangerous.

663
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:37,541
Okay.

664
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:50,471
PRESIDENT MOON GWANG-MU

665
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:53,015
MARINE
IF IT DOESN'T WORK, MAKE IT WORK!

666
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,183
Yes, sir.

667
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:56,060
Hey, am I calling at a bad time?

668
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,770
No, sir. Please go ahead.

669
00:39:57,853 --> 00:40:00,856
Yes, I wanted to ask you a favor.
Find someone for me.

670
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,024
Yes, one moment, please.

671
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:04,819
Say the word, sir.

672
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:06,904
"A good person."

673
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:09,657
"A skilled bodyguard,

674
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:13,619
even better if they were knowledgeable
about the loan business."

675
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,748
Okay, sir.

676
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,835
I will find the best candidates
as soon as I can.

677
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:22,753
Thanks for your help.

678
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:25,214
Yes, sir. Salute!

679
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:29,051
Mayweather is the top dog.

680
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:32,471
But Mayweather seems
more like a businessman than a boxer.

681
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:36,434
That's right. He's in it for the money,
but he is ridiculously good at it.

682
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:38,936
I'm sure he's made
a few hundred billion won.

683
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:40,771
Does money matter to you?

684
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:43,357
What matters more than money?

685
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:45,192
The heart of a boxer.

686
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,196
What?

687
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:52,658
What is it?

688
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,997
-Jeez. What?
-Nothing. I'm sorry.

689
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,540
Jeez. Hey.

690
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:02,585
You just got so serious all of a sudden.

691
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:04,462
That caught me off guard.

692
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:06,922
Elaborate on this boxer's heart.

693
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,340
Well…

694
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:11,927
I think Manny Pacquiao is the best.

695
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:15,306
Pow! Pow, Pacquiao!

696
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:18,642
Let me have my moment.
I never cut you off when you are talking.

697
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:22,605
I'm sorry, Marine sir.
I will never cut you off. Yes!

698
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:26,942
I really admire Pacquiao's heart.
He never gives up.

699
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:30,738
I can give him that,
but Mayweather made a lot more money.

700
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:34,658
But I bet a lot more kids started dreaming
of becoming a boxer because of Pacquiao.

701
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,076
The same goes for me.

702
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:40,539
This is the kind of person I want to be.

703
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:43,709
A person who shows
that dreams can come true

704
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,212
if you have a strong will
and undying passion.

705
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:47,796
It's really windy today.

706
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,007
That is a true boxer's heart

707
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:54,428
and the kind of hope we should inspire
in the people watching our matches.

708
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,138
-A boxer's--
-Hey, this is ready.

709
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:57,181
Let's eat.

710
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,184
Here.

711
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:07,399
-Is it good?
-Yes, it's amazing.

712
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,819
What do you do for a living?

713
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:15,366
I used to teach gym classes
to kindergartners at my friend's school.

714
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:16,951
A gym teacher of some sort.

715
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,536
Well, that doesn't suit you.

716
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:22,414
What do you mean? Kids fucking love me.

717
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:24,959
I taught in the morning
and trained in the afternoon.

718
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:27,920
Since the school shut down,
I've been in a bit of a bind.

719
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:34,301
Do you want to go on deliveries with me?
Parcel delivery is booming.

720
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:36,637
-Is the pay good?
-Yes.

721
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,305
If we put our minds to it,

722
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,766
we could each make
about 200,000 won per day.

723
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:41,725
Seriously?

724
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,727
Yes, delivery work is good cardio.

725
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:47,147
You use muscles you don't use for boxing,
improving your balance.

726
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:49,441
It's like killing two birds
with one stone. Damn.

727
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:51,569
-It's three birds.
-How come?

728
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:54,572
You make money, get your cardio in,
and improve your balance.

729
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:57,157
Hey, cardio and balance
are counted as one.

730
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,993
No, they are different.

731
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:00,077
Jeez.

732
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:04,290
Anyway, weren't you going on
to compete in the Super Series

733
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:06,709
as the Korean representative
since you won the tournament?

734
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:10,254
Yes, but it's been postponed indefinitely
due to COVID-19.

735
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:14,592
How long will that take?

736
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:16,760
There's nothing I can do about it.

737
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:23,142
But I'll always be ready to fight.

738
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:29,773
You seem to have a boxer's heart.

739
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:38,407
Hey.

740
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:40,367
-Come on, Pacquiao.
-Right now?

741
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:42,411
Come on!

742
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:48,751
Whoa…

743
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:50,753
Why would you hit me for real?

744
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:51,962
My bad. I'm sorry.

745
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:54,715
Hey, come here. Let go.

746
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:57,885
Come here, Kim Gun-woo!

747
00:43:57,968 --> 00:44:00,054
Hey, Kim Gun-woo! Come here!

748
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:04,224
Now, cheers!

749
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:07,603
Drink up!

750
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:10,939
Today's main event!
The greatest show on Earth!

751
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:14,276
Cracking a watermelon with In-beom!

752
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:17,112
Come on! Place your bets!

753
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:19,073
A million won that he fails!

754
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:23,243
I bet three million won he succeeds!

755
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:27,623
If I win this pot, everything's on me!

756
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:29,249
Beom.

757
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:32,336
I know you'll crack it,
but I'm betting 4 million that you can't.

758
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:36,340
-Kang In-beom!
-Let's go!

759
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:39,134
-Kang In-beom!
-Kang In-beom!

760
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:41,178
-Let's go!
-Kang In-beom!

761
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:43,972
He cracked it!

762
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,768
Go eat tteokbokki!

763
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:49,645
Let's have some tteokbokki!

764
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:50,813
That was awesome!

765
00:44:51,897 --> 00:44:53,315
I did well, didn't I?

766
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:54,650
DEAREST MAYOR

767
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:58,570
Quiet!

768
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,120
Yes, Mr. Mayor.

769
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:09,415
Yes.

770
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:13,627
Yes.

771
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:18,674
Yes, sir.

772
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:21,385
Yes, I understand.

773
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:22,761
I will let him know.

774
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:25,222
Have a good evening, sir.

775
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:31,770
Our mayor will

776
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:34,690
back your casino project.

777
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:46,618
I have prepared a small gift

778
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:49,288
for your birthday, Mr. Park.

779
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:55,377
Open it.

780
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:03,594
It's 3.7 kilograms of gold.

781
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:09,683
Mr. Park, these turtles are so clean
that no one would know if you took them.

782
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:12,269
I prepared these in hopes

783
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:15,272
that our relationship
will continue for a long time.

784
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:18,692
I would greatly appreciate it
if you accepted them.

785
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:29,870
Look beyond City Hall.

786
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:33,415
I know you have big dreams.

787
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:35,459
If you plan on going to the Blue House

788
00:46:35,542 --> 00:46:38,170
and to the National Assembly,
you will need money.

789
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:40,881
Let's forge a lasting partnership.

790
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:43,759
I will support you to the fullest.

791
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:48,889
My money has never known failure.

792
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:05,864
Hey!

793
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:08,283
Hey, where are we going?

794
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:10,994
Please get in carefully.
We'll take you home.

795
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:11,912
Let's go.

796
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,587
When will you crack down
on Assemblyman Seo's building?

797
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:23,257
It differs by store. But by this Friday,

798
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:26,093
all of them will have accrued
over 20 million in interest.

799
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:28,512
The small ones will leave
with some convincing.

800
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:31,139
People tend to give up easier

801
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:36,436
if they see the ground-floor storefront
in shambles every time they go to work.

802
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:39,565
I will do as you say, sir.

803
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:43,485
Since Mr. Jung is not feeling well
and can't come with you,

804
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:46,363
tell them to send over
about 15 intimidating men.

805
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:47,573
Beom can wrap things up.

806
00:47:48,073 --> 00:47:49,533
Should we arm them with weapons?

807
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:54,162
No need.
Tell them to suit up and wear masks.

808
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:56,415
Sir, I think five should be enough.

809
00:47:56,498 --> 00:47:59,459
I am sure the boss has his reasons.

810
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:02,713
You're right.

811
00:48:03,338 --> 00:48:04,965
I have made a huge mistake.

812
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:09,553
You shitheads, there you go again.

813
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:11,430
Hey, focus. So?

814
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:13,891
Where do you want to begin?

815
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:54,848
Oh, hello.

816
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:57,184
You didn't keep your promise.

817
00:48:58,810 --> 00:48:59,645
What?

818
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:01,772
You agreed to pay an extension fee

819
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:04,608
in exchange for a lower interest rate.

820
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:06,360
What?

821
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:12,658
You needed to pay the loan extension fee,
which is 10% of the principal,

822
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:16,787
within 24 hours of signing the contract.
It's part of the contract.

823
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:19,164
Because you failed
to do such an easy thing,

824
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,501
your extension fee
has accrued 40 million won in interest.

825
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:26,338
And your credit score has dropped,
so your interest rate is now 20%.

826
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:32,094
We really started this
with the purest of intentions.

827
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:35,263
You ruined everything, damn it!

828
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:39,017
What are you going to do now?

829
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:41,520
Do you have money to cover the interest?

830
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:46,650
I will call the police.

831
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:48,402
The police?

832
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:51,154
Yes.

833
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:03,709
Oh my God.

834
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:12,009
Hey, Mom.

835
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:13,885
Hey, where are you?

836
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:15,303
I'm almost there.

837
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:17,389
Okay, I'm at the café.

838
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:19,558
A bunch of strange people came over…

839
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:21,435
Strange people? Who?

840
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:22,602
Right now…

841
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:26,189
Mom?

842
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:44,124
Smash everything!

843
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:01,183
Who the hell are you, you punk?

844
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:04,019
Who the hell are you? Get lost, you punk!

845
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:07,272
Hey! I told you to scram!

846
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:11,359
This bastard! Hey!

847
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:15,322
-What's going on? Get him.
-You bastard!

848
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:18,784
-Who the hell is this punk?
-Hey! You son of a bitch!

849
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:27,501
Stop that fucker!

850
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:29,586
That son of a bitch!

851
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:31,379
-Damn it!
-Fuck!

852
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:33,840
-Come here.
-Damn it!

853
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:46,478
You bastard!

854
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:54,694
You son of a bitch!

855
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:11,711
You fuck!

856
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:27,519
-Mom, are you all right?
-Yes.

857
00:52:27,602 --> 00:52:28,728
Are you hurt?

858
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:30,689
I'm okay.

859
00:52:41,449 --> 00:52:42,367
Who are you?

860
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:46,037
How dare you do this to our café.

861
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:48,915
I asked who you are.

862
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:10,437
Calm down, kid.

863
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:14,691
Your mother borrowed
some money from our company.

864
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:17,319
Okay.

865
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:20,405
What do you want?

866
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:22,908
Pay back what you owe.

867
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:25,327
Pay for the damages to our café first.

868
00:53:47,098 --> 00:53:48,183
Beom.

869
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:01,863
Mom, it's okay.
Go over there for a second.

870
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:02,948
Gun-woo.

871
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:21,609
