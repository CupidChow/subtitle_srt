1
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,319
The Bai Family

2
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,280
In this remote place beyond the law

3
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:08,120
I could kill you all and dump you in the ravine

4
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,200
Who could hold me accountable?

5
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,000
Do it!

6
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:10,519
You!

7
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:12,200
Spirits manifest, guided by the underworld

8
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,280
At my command, wandering souls appear

9
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:14,280
Show yourselves now!

10
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,040
Disobey and face eternal damnation

11
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:25,319
Don't look!

12
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:34,439
Why are you running?

13
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,000
Who?

14
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:43,239
The person you killed - who was it?

15
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:49,280
There's nobody here!

16
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:59,879
My ancestors!

17
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,760
Hero!

18
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,879
Help me please!

19
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,919
A life for a life!

20
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:17,360
Give me back my life!

21
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,439
I can't help with that

22
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:24,840
You should ask her

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,400
I was just following orders

24
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:29,479
I wasn't the only one involved

25
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:32,080
Those bastards who ran away did it too

26
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,879
What are you doing?

27
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:18,919
What do you want?

28
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:19,919
How did he wake up?

29
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:20,919
Quick! Give him the drug!

30
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:21,680
Hurry with the medicine!

31
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,960
This is the Yellow Immortal Temple

32
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:30,599
You!

33
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:31,879
I told you to leave! Let go!

34
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,680
You won't get away with this either

35
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,240
You were impersonating the Yellow Immortal

36
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:35,560
Help!

37
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:36,479
Help me!

38
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:39,319
No! Stop!

39
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,120
There is no Yellow Immortal

40
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,199
I'll report this to the authorities

41
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:45,439
Try reporting it then!

42
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:08,280
He's not breathing

43
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,680
What do we do now?

44
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,399
Great Immortal

45
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,879
I don't know why

46
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:46,800
He suddenly woke up

47
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:49,680
Maybe the drug wasn't strong enough

48
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,680
Your devotion wasn't sincere enough

49
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:56,000
I...

50
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,800
I even killed someone

51
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,519
Great Immortal, you...

52
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,240
You must help me

53
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:06,000
Help you?

54
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,639
That depends

55
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,160
on how sincere you are

56
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,639
Great Immortal

57
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:32,480
I was just following orders

58
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:33,399
Hero!

59
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:35,439
I know I was wrong

60
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:39,319
I admit my mistake

61
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:43,480
Fellow villagers

62
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:45,439
Everything you've witnessed

63
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,839
was orchestrated by this village chief

64
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,600
and his underlings

65
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:51,199
They spread rumors to create panic

66
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,120
just to satisfy their selfish desires

67
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,959
One thing puzzles me

68
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:56,639
You're already the village chief

69
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,800
Why go through all this trouble?

70
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,360
You common mortals

71
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,240
only see trivial matters

72
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,600
But I...

73
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:08,759
am destined to become immortal

74
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:09,720
You?

75
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:10,680
Become immortal? Ha!

76
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:11,439
Beast!

77
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,639
Who told you this nonsense?

78
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:16,759
Answer me! Who told you?

79
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:17,800
Speak up!

80
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:19,240
Move aside! Out of the way!

81
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,439
Beat him! Get him!

82
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,279
Attack!

83
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,879
Where's that young immortal from before?

84
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,240
Right ahead! There he is!

85
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,720
Men and women shouldn't be too intimate, I'm telling you.

86
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:46,560
How do you know the village chief killed someone?

87
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:48,959
Can you really see ghosts?

88
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:50,560
No, who the heck are you?

89
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:52,560
There are no ghosts in this world.

90
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:56,279
Take a closer look.

91
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,480
You really don't remember me?

92
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,519
Have you fallen for someone else?

93
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:00,240
Calm down.

94
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:01,800
Calm down.

95
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,160
A proper young lady

96
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:07,040
shouldn't play with weapons - it's dangerous.

97
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:08,399
Right?

98
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,680
I just noticed clues on the corpse

99
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,680
and deduced who's using the Immortal Huang Xian for evil.

100
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,720
For guilty people like the village chief,

101
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,600
my hypnotic bell makes them

102
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,519
confess everything.

103
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,439
Besides,

104
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,000
we barely know each other.

105
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,759
Why talk about liking someone?

106
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:23,240
I...

107
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,600
Wait a minute.

108
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,560
Then take a good look at this.

109
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:40,519
Laifu, don't make a sound.

110
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,040
Not a single sound.

111
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:13,720
What?

112
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:14,959
Want it?

113
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:17,560
Then come with me.

114
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,680
Speak.

115
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,160
Where are we going?

116
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,279
Harbin.

117
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,000
Harbin.

118
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,759
Brother Laifu,

119
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:33,679
for your great kindness

120
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:34,919
I can't express my gratitude.

121
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:36,360
Don't mention it.

122
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:36,840
I wish...

123
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:37,559
Really, it's nothing.

124
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,600
I wish to offer myself in marriage.

125
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,519
I told you it's nothing.

126
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,080
Offer myself in marriage?

127
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,039
Miss,

128
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:45,960
a proper girl shouldn't say such things.

129
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,279
It sounds improper if word gets out.

130
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:48,360
Right? No, you... you...

131
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,480
Who are you? Exactly!

132
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:49,960
You...

133
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:51,080
Offer what to whom?

134
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,600
I mean,

135
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:52,320
you can't marry him.

136
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,039
He's my fiancé - this isn't proper.

137
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:54,120
Did you hear? I'm her fi-

138
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:55,559
fiancé.

139
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:00,519
You promised to marry me when we grew up.

140
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,320
We had an arranged childhood marriage.

141
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:04,240
I was too young to remember.

142
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:08,200
Forget it.

143
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,240
I'll forgive you since you solved the case.

144
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,200
Since we're in Harbin,

145
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,720
come change your outfit with me.

146
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,720
Cigarettes, sir?

147
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,080
Welcome, please come in.

148
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,399
Browse freely, you two.

149
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:32,799
This one.

150
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,600
Welcome to Da Shijie.

151
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,799
Miss Bai, you're here.

152
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:55,919
Xiaomei.

153
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:56,799
Right away.

154
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,240
Sir, this way please.

155
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,720
Sit here.

156
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:05,360
Here.

157
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,279
Take good care of them.

158
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:11,720
Your drink.

159
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,639
Enjoy.

160
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:13,799
First time here?

161
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:17,039
Shall I pour you a drink?

162
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:23,639
No, thank you.

163
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,799
You may leave now.

164
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,799
We have things to discuss.

165
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,759
Understood, Miss Bai.

166
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,799
Remember to look for me next time.

167
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,080
I've arrived in Harbin.

168
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:43,039
Photographs.

169
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,679
You're such a country bumpkin.

170
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:47,799
Now that we're here,

171
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,039
you're still thinking about photos?

172
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,000
I don't want photos.

173
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,320
Why did I come to Harbin?

174
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,080
You Harbin folks are the open-minded ones.

175
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:57,240
Calling someone "fiancé" at first meeting,

176
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,399
then bringing your fiancé to such a place.

177
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:02,080
This bumpkin has truly broadened his horizons.

178
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:04,639
Fine.

179
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,879
Then listen carefully.

180
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:10,080
According to folklore,

181
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,360
foxes absorb cosmic energy

182
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,679
to become Fox Immortals.

183
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:15,919
These Fox Immortals excel at enchantment,

184
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,480
most adept at beguiling hearts.

185
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,519
Dancers here worship Fox Immortals routinely

186
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,879
to make customers utterly devoted.
