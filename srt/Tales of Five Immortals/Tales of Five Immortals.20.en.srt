1
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:04,959
What are you doing?

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,640
Come with me.

3
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,519
Where to?

4
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,920
I'll take you somewhere.

5
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:09,000
Where exactly?

6
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,680
Hurry up, be good.

7
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:11,920
No.

8
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,400
I know who killed Laifu.

9
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,359
Come with me.

10
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:21,719
I'll take you to him.

11
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:23,719
Really?

12
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:24,560
Of course.

13
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:25,359
Let's go.

14
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:49,239
Just ahead.

15
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,359
Turn right up ahead.

16
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:52,920
Let's go.

17
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,159
Xiao Wei.

18
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,520
Where is this?

19
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:11,960
Didn't you say

20
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:13,639
you'd take me to Laifu's killer?

21
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,240
Yes.

22
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,599
Don't be afraid.

23
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:16,479
I...

24
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,439
I want to tell you

25
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,360
I...

26
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,719
think we're meant to be together.

27
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,520
Laifu has nothing.

28
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,919
He doesn't understand you,

29
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,639
nor cherish you.

30
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:29,680
But I'm different.

31
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:32,879
Xiao Wei.

32
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,000
I've always loved you.

33
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,240
I've been waiting for you.

34
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,360
What are you doing, Sun Heng?

35
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,879
Let go! You're hurting me!

36
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:43,919
Let go!

37
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:48,400
No one's coming to save you.

38
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,560
That guy's already dead.

39
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,919
That Commander Gu you're always with

40
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,520
works for my father.

41
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,000
Think carefully.

42
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:25,120
My family has power.

43
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:27,599
You'd better think hard.

44
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:30,599
You're the last of the Bai family.

45
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,439
I can protect you,

46
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,800
or destroy your family.

47
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,280
Sun Heng, calm down!

48
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:37,439
I'd rather die alone

49
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,560
than be with you.

50
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:51,039
Xiao Wei.

51
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,719
I...I'm sorry, so sorry.

52
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:53,520
Forgive me.

53
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:54,560
Please forgive me.

54
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:55,840
I...

55
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:57,719
I just wanted to say

56
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,199
if you'll be with me,

57
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,120
I can give you

58
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:03,520
a lifetime of

59
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:06,439
wealth and luxury.

60
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:08,960
Disgusting!

61
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,280
I gave you face, you refused.

62
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,759
Help!

63
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:16,439
Help!

64
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,360
I gave you the choice to be human.

65
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,519
Now you'll be my sacrifice.

66
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:54,199
Like this outfit?

67
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,480
You're vile!

68
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,839
You're right.

69
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,000
What are you doing?

70
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:54,279
She's mine.

71
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:17,680
San Ye.

72
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,839
This girl's quality is good.

73
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:21,600
She's with me tonight.

74
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:23,199
Young Marshal.

75
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,199
I can see

76
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,720
you like this girl.

77
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,319
But you can't take her today.

78
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:30,439
She's useful to me.

79
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,720
I heard at Baixian Villa,

80
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,800
with enough money,

81
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:41,879
anything goes.

82
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:43,360
So?

83
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,560
San Ye,

84
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,920
is my offer too low?

85
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:49,360
Or my status too humble?

86
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:52,639
They say he appeared suddenly,

87
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:54,360
few know his background.

88
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,560
Exactly.

89
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:58,959
Like he materialized from thin air.

90
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,160
Ruthless methods.

91
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,800
Intimidated many officers instantly.

92
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:09,600
Young Marshal, no need for anger.

93
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,839
If you truly like this girl,

94
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:13,759
you may take her.

95
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:15,600
But just for two hours.

96
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:18,560
Our grand plan comes first.

97
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,319
This is my final concession.

98
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:23,759
Then I thank San Ye.

99
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,039
This Young Marshal

100
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,120
He commands a large army

101
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,320
You see

102
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:39,039
Even San Ye

103
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,320
has to show him respect

104
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:56,879
Who are you?

105
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,279
Stay away!

106
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,440
Don't come closer!

107
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,240
Laifu

108
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:46,960
I need your cooperation

109
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:48,159
to stage a show

110
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:52,960
Don't approach!

111
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:55,559
If you come closer

112
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,080
I won't hold back

113
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,720
The more you resist, the more I enjoy

114
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,000
Let me go!

115
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,600
Stay back! Now!

116
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:07,919
Take off your clothes

117
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,080
Let me have my pleasure

118
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,000
Release me!

119
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,600
Xiao Wei

120
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,360
You...

121
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,080
You're alive

122
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:36,480
I'm sorry

123
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:37,960
I came too late

124
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:41,360
Do you know how long I've searched?

125
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:43,200
Where have you been?

126
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:45,919
Don't worry

127
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,440
I'll get you out

128
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,399
Are you hurt?

129
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,559
What about Grandpa?

130
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,000
Is Grandpa alive?

131
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:05,919
It's a long story

132
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,519
They're here

133
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,240
Bai Ye is dying

134
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,039
Laifu's still breathing

135
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:35,000
Bai Ye

136
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:36,320
Bai Ye!

137
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:39,639
You're awake

138
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:41,919
Where am I?

139
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:44,240
Our military infirmary

140
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:45,639
Rest assured

141
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,080
You're safe here

142
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,480
You're Commander Gu?

143
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,039
Lie down quickly

144
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:01,279
Commander Gu

145
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:11,679
Commander Gu!

146
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,279
So you got my letter

147
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,279
We've waited long

148
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,360
Never expected

149
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:21,799
it'd be over a decade

150
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:23,960
In Bai Ye's study

151
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,320
I found my father's letters

152
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,600
He mentioned you there

153
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:31,879
So I wrote to you

154
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,120
Never thought

155
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:37,440
you'd save me in time

156
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:42,919
What about Bai Ye?

157
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:44,799
When we arrived

158
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:47,120
he was already gone

159
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:48,639
But

160
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,679
we recovered his body

161
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:53,759
and gave him burial

162
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:57,559
I failed to save him

163
00:12:59,039 --> 00:12:59,879
Speaking of which

164
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:03,559
how did you know my father?

165
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,799
He saved my life

166
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:11,399
Not just me

167
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:13,519
but my whole family

168
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,200
So

169
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,759
I owe him a debt

170
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:22,240
This book's secret

171
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,759
blocked the fatal bullet

172
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:26,240
This book saved me

173
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,320
Think it's just a manual?

174
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,720
Commander Gu, what's this?

175
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,840
I promised your father

176
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:53,360
with this Command Tally

177
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,679
I'd give him troops

178
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,320
under his command

179
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:08,600
This is what Chunsheng seeks

180
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:11,360
Indeed

181
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:15,519
All these years Bai Ye and I

182
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:18,000
He protected you

183
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,559
to keep you from conflict

184
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,080
Commander Gu

185
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:27,279
In this world

186
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,519
conflict's unavoidable

187
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,559
Especially with vengeance

188
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,679
For my parents

189
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,200
and Bai Ye's life

190
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:46,559
I'll make them pay in blood

191
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,919
Young Master Laifu's your new leader

192
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,279
From today, obey his orders

193
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,000
Yes!

194
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:12,120
Greetings, Young Master!
