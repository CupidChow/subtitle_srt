1
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:21,799
Go over there

2
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:46,840
They're all useless

3
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,040
How could they escape?

4
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,159
This is an isolated island

5
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,799
They fled so quickly

6
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:56,159
Someone must be helping them

7
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,519
Do you know how much effort

8
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:01,879
I spent finding these girls?

9
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,200
Each of them

10
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,200
has unique birth signs and fate

11
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,840
Now they're gone

12
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,000
This ritual

13
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,840
is now worthless

14
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:13,680
Don't worry, Bai San Ye

15
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:15,520
Finding them again quickly

16
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,400
is unlikely

17
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:17,879
But I have another way

18
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,120
By chance, I once learned

19
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,639
a forbidden palace technique

20
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,719
A destiny-rewriting array

21
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,360
It can drain everyone's life force

22
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,479
into longevity power

23
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,039
to extend your life

24
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,360
However

25
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,599
this array is extremely dangerous

26
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,599
hence forbidden

27
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:41,759
Why didn't you say so earlier?

28
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:44,960
The keystone responds to emotions

29
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,199
Gathering emotional energy

30
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,719
Requires deep hatred or resentment

31
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,400
or extreme joy and sorrow

32
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,039
to power the array

33
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,439
What about fear?

34
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:57,680
The deepest fears in people's hearts

35
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:59,120
can also power it

36
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,560
Any madness

37
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:01,840
sorrow

38
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:03,639
greed

39
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:05,120
or fear

40
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:07,039
can fuel the array

41
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,919
The stronger the emotions

42
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,240
the more powerful the array

43
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:19,319
Send all guests to their rooms

44
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,240
Tell them

45
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,199
the array requires meditation

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,240
Don't let them suspect anything

47
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,439
Rest assured, Bai San Ye

48
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,840
There'll be no mistakes

49
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:34,240
But after success

50
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:35,879
what you promised me

51
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,599
better not forget

52
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,560
Starting tomorrow

53
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:47,280
if you still wish

54
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,719
to serve me loyally

55
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,240
I'll grant you wealth and status

56
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,719
Then I thank you in advance

57
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:08,840
Bai San Ye

58
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:10,520
I'm sorry

59
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,400
But they can't have gone far

60
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:16,680
Send more men with me

61
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,120
I'll capture them

62
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,879
Then why wait?

63
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,560
Go after them now

64
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,519
Yes

65
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,639
Understood

66
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:36,040
Let me go

67
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,040
Here you are

68
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:39,439
I've searched everywhere for you

69
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:40,240
Move

70
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,879
Where are you going, Young Marshal?

71
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,480
Bai San Ye has retired

72
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,279
Just taking a walk

73
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,800
Just walking around

74
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,959
Bai Gongguan isn't like other places

75
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:17,079
Don't wander aimlessly

76
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:20,800
By the way

77
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,879
What's your troop designation?

78
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:28,519
Don't you know Bai Gongguan's rules?

79
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:30,439
Ask what's appropriate

80
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,519
Don't ask what's not

81
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,720
Some questions are off limits

82
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,600
You've worked all night, Young Marshal

83
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:41,959
I've prepared something special

84
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,439
To help you relax

85
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:46,920
My standards are high

86
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,480
Amateurish tricks

87
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,040
won't impress me

88
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:55,279
You'll be satisfied

89
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:57,680
After you

90
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,040
Stop

91
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:26,240
Young Marshal

92
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,800
This way

93
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,360
Exciting, isn't it?

94
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,839
If you want more thrills

95
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,879
you can participate

96
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:42,480
I'm not interested in such games

97
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,920
That's easily solved

98
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:21,600
We can use a knife on this one

99
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:23,800
As long as we don't kill her

100
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:26,680
Keep her alive until the ritual begins

101
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,079
That's all we need

102
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,279
The Young Marshal is quite the gentleman

103
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,279
Unlike us crude fellows

104
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,519
Why not change your perspective?

105
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:43,160
These girls are just livestock

106
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,120
It's their honor to provide us pleasure

107
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:46,519
They should be grateful

108
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,399
Since the Young Marshal can't do it

109
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,160
Then I'll take over

110
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,560
Stop!

111
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:57,199
Don't move!

112
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,319
On your knees!

113
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,160
Just as I thought - Laifu

114
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:13,240
Laifu

115
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,959
Laifu

116
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:17,040
You were just bait to lure me out

117
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,920
Didn't expect you to be so tough

118
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:25,600
You're still alive

119
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:27,560
How could I bear to die?

120
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:32,279
I was going to spare you

121
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:34,559
But you chose the path of death

122
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,840
Perfect

123
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:38,080
I've prepared a surprise for you

124
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:39,279
What exactly are you planning?

125
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,080
Kneel!

126
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:41,279
Behave yourself

127
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,159
I want to see your despair

128
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,840
Watch your spirit burn out

129
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,519
The moment your will breaks

130
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,399
Then

131
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,919
You'll be the perfect keystone

132
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:52,519
Take her away

133
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:55,600
Move!

134
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,279
Go!

135
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,000
Laifu

136
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,919
The Dao is vague and indistinct

137
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:33,960
Indistinct and vague, yet contains forms

138
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,159
Vague and indistinct, yet contains substance

139
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,279
Profound and dark, yet contains essence

140
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:43,879
This essence is genuine, containing truth

141
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:47,279
This is what your Dao De Jing describes

142
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,080
The Dao cannot be seen or touched

143
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,480
But it's the foundation of all creation

144
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,320
Those who attain the Dao

145
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,480
Can transcend the limits of time

146
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:03,759
Rise above birth, aging, and death

147
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,480
Achieve eternal life

148
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,840
I was fortunate to meet extraordinary men

149
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:13,399
Who taught me the White Immortal's secrets

150
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:16,480
Now I share them with you, the chosen ones

151
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:24,399
Bai San Ye, the auspicious time has come

152
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,000
Let us begin

153
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,360
Yin and yang merge, souls return to formless

154
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:34,279
Fate disrupted, destiny can be changed

155
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,279
With this sacrifice, we defy heaven

156
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:39,919
Borrowing your life force for my longevity

157
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,279
Originally I needed only a few girls as keystones

158
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,799
Their fates aligned perfectly

159
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:50,000
Their life force would suffice

160
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:51,960
To worship the White Immortal

161
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:56,720
But someone interfered

162
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,399
And let them all escape

163
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,120
The remaining girls here

164
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,320
Have incompatible fates, useless to me

165
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,639
So I must change my approach

166
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:15,360
I'll sacrifice all your life force instead

167
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:15,960
This...

168
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,600
Life force?

169
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,360
To grant Bai San Ye true immortality

170
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,200
Father!

171
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:24,279
What's happening?

172
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,639
Bai San Ye!

173
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,840
This wasn't the plan you described

174
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,320
You win some, you lose some

175
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:36,000
Didn't you all come here

176
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,639
For me to extend your lives?

177
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:39,200
Now I've changed my mind

178
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,399
I'll take your life force

179
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,600
As tribute to Bai San Ye

180
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,080
And our worshipped immortal

181
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,240
Any objections?

182
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:45,960
You're all madmen!

183
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,240
I'm done with this madness!

184
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:50,639
Son!

185
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:52,440
Son!

186
00:11:59,120 --> 00:11:59,720
Son!

187
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:07,159
Bai San Ye!

188
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:08,279
Bai San Ye!
