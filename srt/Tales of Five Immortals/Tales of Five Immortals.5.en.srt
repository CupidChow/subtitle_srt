1
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,400
A magician

2
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,760
How could he be killed by his own act?

3
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,000
There was nothing unusual during the show

4
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:17,560
Then his prop mechanism must have failed

5
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:26,640
I examined your props that day

6
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,000
They had been swapped

7
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,879
The fake blade was replaced with a real one

8
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,000
The rope was also tampered with

9
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,680
So this was no performance accident

10
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,200
It was murder

11
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,280
Enough

12
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,439
What did you find?

13
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,560
I examined the magician's props

14
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,480
For a normal Sawing Illusion act

15
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:51,959
The blades have special mechanisms

16
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:55,040
Mechanism on - real blade cuts watermelon

17
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:57,480
Off - fake blade "cuts" the assistant

18
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:00,239
But his blade was switched

19
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,879
Fake one replaced with a real blade

20
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,359
By the time he realized

21
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,480
It was too late

22
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,000
What?

23
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:09,639
The magician's props were already

24
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,680
collected as evidence

25
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,800
I'll verify your claims immediately

26
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,199
If you're lying

27
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:17,599
I'll treat you as an accomplice

28
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:19,400
But if I'm right

29
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,240
I want to examine

30
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,199
the body of Boss Hu

31
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:23,000
who died at the nightclub

32
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,479
Also

33
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,759
bring the guillotine rope too

34
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:34,680
Officer Gu

35
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,599
I'm thirsty

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,879
Stay put

37
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:38,919
Go back

38
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:44,000
You promised to save me

39
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,800
Why aren't you coming?

40
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,000
Would he really abandon me?

41
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,240
Boss Hu was a nightclub regular

42
00:02:58,919 --> 00:02:59,759
A week ago

43
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,560
he was found hanged at the nightclub

44
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,960
on the second floor railing

45
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:06,080
People said

46
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:08,000
he'd been cheated by the Japanese

47
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,039
lost a fortune

48
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,919
and had been depressed for days

49
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,159
No signs of others at the scene

50
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,520
We suspected suicide

51
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,840
Here's what you wanted

52
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:28,719
The magician's prop rope

53
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:51,479
Notice the pattern - familiar?

54
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,719
The patterns match

55
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,039
How do you prove it's not coincidence?

56
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,439
Officer Gu

57
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,000
I know something about magic

58
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:11,080
Magicians usually use

59
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,960
the cheapest hemp ropes

60
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,800
But this one was specially treated

61
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,120
Smoother

62
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:18,680
and more flexible

63
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:21,399
The killer wanted to tell us something

64
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,079
Officer Gu

65
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:25,000
Am I right?

66
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,720
You already know the answer

67
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,120
You're correct

68
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,079
When collecting evidence earlier

69
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,759
I specifically compared

70
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:40,199
the magician's prop rope

71
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:41,959
with Boss Hu's hanging rope

72
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,120
They're identical

73
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:58,079
Officer Gu

74
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:04,120
Look

75
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:10,120
These are two sections of the same rope

76
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,959
Boss Hu was murdered

77
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,920
The killer left us clues

78
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:15,959
Here's an idea

79
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,800
Let's play along with their game

80
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,959
Send me back to investigate the nightclub

81
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:26,160
You're

82
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:27,759
becoming more interesting

83
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,560
Want to stay and assist me?

84
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:33,120
These past few days

85
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,040
it's the Japanese Commander's birthday

86
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:36,399
Most of our police force

87
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,879
is stationed at his residence

88
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:40,120
I haven't allocated many officers

89
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,480
to this case

90
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:43,879
Inspector Gu

91
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,759
If you trust me

92
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,759
why not release Miss Bai first

93
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,759
She's been with me these two days

94
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,560
and just arrived in Ha City today

95
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,240
She couldn't have committed the crime

96
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:55,160
With her help

97
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,319
I can definitely solve this case

98
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,800
Do you know who I am?

99
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,680
Hurry, let go!

100
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,040
Why did you take so long to come?

101
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:09,040
Find anything?

102
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:14,639
Isn't this the Bai family's young mistress?

103
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,160
Have the Bai family pull some strings

104
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:20,839
and you could get out

105
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,160
I'm not the murderer

106
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,480
Why should I use connections?

107
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,920
You're lucky to have Laifu as a friend

108
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:35,879
Out of respect for Laifu

109
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:38,079
But Laifu

110
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:41,040
I'll only give you three days to find the killer

111
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:43,279
Otherwise Miss Bai here

112
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,399
remains a suspect

113
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,759
You...

114
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,759
Actually

115
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,800
you don't need to care about her fate

116
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,439
You're very capable

117
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,920
You could stay and help me

118
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,759
I could hire you as special consultant

119
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,000
Better than following her around

120
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:05,920
as a mere sidekick

121
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,639
Inspector Gu has quite the methods

122
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,199
First the slap

123
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,240
then the sweet date

124
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,600
Just some small tricks

125
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,720
I have many ways to handle suspects

126
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,319
I'm warning you

127
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,240
He's mine

128
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:18,360
Don't get any ideas

129
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:21,800
That depends if you can keep him

130
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,240
My patience is limited

131
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,040
But this offer

132
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,480
remains open to you

133
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,959
Thank you for your kindness, Inspector

134
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,680
We have guests coming

135
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,680
Boss, we're closed

136
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:52,759
I know

137
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,519
We're here about something else

138
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:57,160
You two...

139
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:58,240
Yesterday you made

140
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,240
a mess of my place

141
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:00,800
What do you want today?

142
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:05,519
The Bai family investigates

143
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,319
Bai family handles ghosts and spirits

144
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:11,480
Never heard they handle human affairs

145
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,240
We're not here for nothing

146
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:21,759
Let's talk

147
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:29,279
Girls, back to work!

148
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,320
Who did Boss Hu meet before dying?

149
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,159
Me, me, me!

150
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,879
After leaving my room

151
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,159
he died immediately

152
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,919
I know nothing about it!

153
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,840
Was Boss Hu acting strange that day?

154
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,799
Strange?

155
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:12,480
He said his chest was burning

156
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,440
I massaged his chest

157
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:19,320
What about the wedding cup?

158
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,440
Come, come

159
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,159
Why's it so hot?

160
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,840
Let me blow and rub it

161
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:33,399
No!

162
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:36,519
Too stuffy

163
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,279
Get away!

164
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:42,200
So hot!

165
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,600
Boss Hu...

166
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,240
Ziyan!

167
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:05,480
Ziyan!

168
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,320
Ziyan is already dead

169
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:13,639
The girls say Ziyan never left

170
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,840
She's still in the nightclub

171
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:17,919
When did Ziyan die?

172
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,080
How did she die?

173
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,799
Just last month

174
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:29,039
That young witch used her youth

175
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,679
to steal other women's men

176
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,039
She was a vixen

177
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,879
Darn it

178
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,159
Tell us more

179
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,519
What's there to say?

180
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,559
Women like us

181
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:47,840
either die of venereal disease

182
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:49,720
or by men's hands

183
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,639
Who knows what illness she had?

184
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,559
Couldn't take it and hanged herself

185
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,759
Just like Boss Hu's hanging

186
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:13,080
I wouldn't know

187
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,320
Ask them

188
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:15,559
You...

189
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:29,960
Don't be afraid, everyone.

190
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,039
Young Master Lin is taking me out to eat later.

191
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,720
I'm going to touch up my makeup first.

192
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,639
I'll go to the restroom first too.

193
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:42,039
You all chat slowly.

194
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:43,600
We need to go practice our dance.

195
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:44,120
Let's go, let's go.

196
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,720
Yes yes, we need to touch up our makeup.

197
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:46,639
Sit for a while first.

198
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,840
Now look what happened.

199
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,039
None of them are willing to cooperate.

200
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:54,080
We'll just have to wait and see.

201
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:56,960
It's all your fault.

202
00:11:57,399 --> 00:11:58,200
I spent all that money.

203
00:11:58,279 --> 00:11:59,240
And got no information at all.

204
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:00,679
Give me my money back.

205
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:01,559
No,

206
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,639
aren't we investigating this case together?

207
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:11,960
The person is already dead.

208
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,399
What's the point of asking now?

209
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:24,360
Ziyan,

210
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:25,840
every grievance has its source.

211
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,039
I've never wronged you.

212
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:28,480
Please don't come after me.

213
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:29,120
Ziyan?

214
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:40,080
Who's there?

215
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:41,759
Who's over there?

216
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:22,960
Probably just a rat.

217
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:28,000
I'll get a cat tomorrow.

218
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:31,519
See if you dare cause any more trouble.

219
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:49,799
Let's go check.

220
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:53,279
It's haunted.

221
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:54,679
It's haunted!

222
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,440
Be your bride.

223
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,759
Break a willow branch.

224
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:05,879
Stay by your side.

225
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:06,840
It's Ziyan.

226
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,600
Ziyan has come for me.

227
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,720
It's Ziyan.

228
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,919
It's Ziyan's ghost.
