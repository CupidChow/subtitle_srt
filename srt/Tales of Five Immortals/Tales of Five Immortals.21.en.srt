1
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:06,599
I failed to save Bai Ye

2
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry

3
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:13,159
It's not your fault

4
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,319
I won't let you say that

5
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:20,840
Xiaowei, don't worry

6
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:24,000
I will find the killer

7
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,519
and avenge Bai Ye

8
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,079
Okay

9
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:34,959
How did you find this place?

10
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,879
Through Chunsheng's clues

11
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:55,959
I tracked it here

12
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,719
Then I discovered

13
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,760
Bai San Ye is a prominent tycoon

14
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,000
Rumors say White Immortal is a healing deity

15
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,079
Chunsheng used this pretense

16
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,400
to make him worship White Immortal

17
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,319
seeking immortality

18
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:11,599
Bai San Ye believes it completely

19
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,280
Officials and nobles flock here

20
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,400
On this Phantom Isle

21
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,840
they built Baixian Villa

22
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,360
This place is lawless

23
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:20,400
They trick naive girls to come here

24
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,840
to satisfy rich men's perversions

25
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,319
Everyone here

26
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,680
has blood on their hands

27
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,639
So

28
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,800
Zhang Hua collected

29
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,439
girls born at the same time

30
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,719
marked their names

31
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:42,240
as pawns for their immortality scheme

32
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,719
Bai San Ye's ambitions grow

33
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:45,879
He's no longer satisfied

34
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:47,639
being a den for the rich

35
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,840
but wants greater power

36
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:52,479
In ancient fortune-telling

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,960
a person's birth

38
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:56,520
year, month, day, hour

39
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:58,599
form Year, Month

40
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,400
Day and Hour Pillars

41
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:03,319
Year Pillar means ancestry

42
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:04,960
Month means parents

43
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,360
Day means oneself

44
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:07,759
Hour means descendants

45
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,199
Each has Heavenly Stem and Earthly Branch

46
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,680
Ten Heavenly Stems, Twelve Earthly Branches

47
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,520
Their combinations

48
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,319
determine one's destiny

49
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:20,759
So

50
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,000
Different birth charts

51
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,319
mean different fates

52
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,000
Right

53
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,039
Birth time and location vary

54
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,840
creating unique destinies

55
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,039
Some have Pure Elemental Destiny

56
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,639
These girls Bai San Ye found

57
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,639
must correspond to

58
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:40,919
Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth elements

59
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:45,879
They're for his ritual

60
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:48,240
Most likely

61
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:50,039
Then

62
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,719
Does this ritual actually work?

63
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,840
Of course not

64
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:56,599
There are no ghosts or gods

65
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,639
My "talking" with the dead

66
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,879
is just noticing things

67
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:03,800
others overlook

68
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,560
In this world

69
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,840
too many entrust fate

70
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,039
to empty superstitions

71
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,280
Reason won't reach them

72
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,400
they won't listen

73
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,120
So we use their superstitions

74
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,199
to communicate

75
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,000
But Bai San Ye's

76
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,959
exact plans remain unclear

77
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:26,920
I need more time

78
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,639
to investigate

79
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,639
Continue

80
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:52,519
Stay back!

81
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,319
Come closer and I'll strike

82
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,759
That's it

83
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:59,160
Your tears excite me, Marshal

84
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:01,360
Enough

85
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,800
What's our next move?

86
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:30,199
Here

87
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:33,000
Time's almost up

88
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,199
They'll come for you soon

89
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,680
I'll send word

90
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:39,920
Lead all the girls out

91
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,800
Then what?

92
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,879
I've hidden a boat west of the island

93
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,240
There's a door behind the kitchen

94
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,240
Meet me there

95
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:52,839
Wait

96
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,240
Take this.

97
00:05:58,519 --> 00:05:59,959
Why are you giving me this?

98
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:04,639
This hairpin...

99
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,399
can unlock the cell door.

100
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:09,240
Now I'm returning it to you.

101
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:11,600
Everything will be alright.

102
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:16,439
Promise me...

103
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:19,000
you'll come back safely.

104
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,600
I will.

105
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,399
Alright, they're coming.

106
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:28,839
Wait.

107
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,560
Your clothes.

108
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:54,879
Young Marshal, it's time.

109
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:55,959
We're taking the prisoner.

110
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:10,879
Move.

111
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,120
Get in.

112
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:37,759
Sit down.

113
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:43,399
Sit down and behave.

114
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,079
Get inside.

115
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:07,959
Behave yourself.

116
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:21,879
Who told you to stand up?

117
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,079
Sit down.

118
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,199
Are you Xiaohua?

119
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,879
How did you get captured?

120
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,759
They pretended to be travelers asking for water...

121
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:38,720
then kidnapped us.

122
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,879
Even if our parents report it, no one would believe them.

123
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,080
Let's try together.

124
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,399
I know how to escape.

125
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:52,240
Xiaohua.

126
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:13,320
Someone's here.

127
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,879
You two, come here.

128
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:19,559
There's someone outside the villa.

129
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:21,600
I saw shadows and torchlight.

130
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:23,200
Young Marshal, please return to your room.

131
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,480
We'll investigate immediately.

132
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,240
Go.

133
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,080
Gather everyone and patrol east.

134
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,399
Intruders! Move!

135
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:31,720
Yes.

136
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:32,360
Yes, yes.

137
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:43,759
Everyone stay put.

138
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,279
If you want to live...

139
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:19,679
follow me now.

140
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:32,799
Go now while no one's here.

141
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:37,759
Go!

142
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,480
Move.

143
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:41,360
Go!

144
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:42,879
Xiaohua.

145
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,200
Hurry!

146
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,279
There's a boat west of the island.

147
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:54,360
Once aboard...

148
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,039
row toward the light.

149
00:10:57,679 --> 00:10:59,200
Get them home safely.

150
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:01,279
What about you?

151
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,799
I must find my family.

152
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:06,879
Go quickly.

153
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,159
Go!

154
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,960
Go!

155
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:17,159
Let's go.

156
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:26,320
Hurry.

157
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:31,039
Faster.

158
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:32,720
Quick.

159
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:34,960
Hurry!
