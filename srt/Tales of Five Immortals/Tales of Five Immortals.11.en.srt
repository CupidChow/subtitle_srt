1
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,359
In this very room

2
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,319
Laifu

3
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:28,640
I know you're in there

4
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,719
Come out right now

5
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,280
I know you're inside

6
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,159
Open the door

7
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,560
Get out here

8
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,959
If you don't want your girlfriend mad

9
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,920
You'd better listen

10
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:45,400
I've no time to argue

11
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,239
Hurry up, what now?

12
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,280
I'll kick the door down

13
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:50,879
No, I...

14
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,200
Are you alone here?

15
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,439
Who else would be here?

16
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:14,319
Sun Heng

17
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:17,000
You said they were both here

18
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:17,840
Where are they?

19
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:19,280
I saw two people enter

20
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,680
They came in this room

21
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:23,400
I told you, no one's here

22
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:30,479
Laifu, get out here!

23
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:38,400
Come out!

24
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,960
What are you doing here?

25
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,000
Bai Xiaojie

26
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,280
Let me explain

27
00:02:58,479 --> 00:02:59,759
It's not what you think

28
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:02,319
Then what is it? Tell me!

29
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,800
Here's what happened

30
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,439
Officer Gu's...

31
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,879
Her zipper broke

32
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,800
I just helped her zip it

33
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:12,919
But I saw nothing, really

34
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:18,479
You helped zip her up?

35
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:21,240
Listen carefully, Laifu

36
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:22,879
From now on

37
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,400
I never want to see you

38
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:25,639
Don't come looking for me

39
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:26,400
Wait...

40
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,360
Bai Xiaojie

41
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:28,960
Xiao Wei

42
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:37,960
Officer Gu

43
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:40,120
You should explain this

44
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,479
Seems you're busy today

45
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:47,759
We'll talk another time

46
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,280
Stupid, smelly Laifu

47
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:08,840
Big liar

48
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:15,080
Xiao Wei, Xiao Wei

49
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,600
Stop drinking

50
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,519
What are you doing?

51
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:20,920
Fill it up

52
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:24,680
Let me tell you

53
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,199
Girls shouldn't drink so much

54
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,319
If you get drunk

55
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:30,519
It's dangerous outside

56
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,079
Just a little is enough

57
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:36,480
Laifu

58
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:42,040
Xiao Wei

59
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,959
Xiao Wei

60
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,199
You drank it all?

61
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:54,959
Here, wipe your mouth

62
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:56,680
Laifu

63
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,319
Xiao Wei

64
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:11,759
Feeling dizzy?

65
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,959
I told you not to drink

66
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,279
Let me take you home

67
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:22,879
Fine, you can drink

68
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,560
But this is too much

69
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:27,959
Come on, Xiao Wei

70
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:28,959
Here we go

71
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,000
Easy, easy

72
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,079
Slow down, come on

73
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:33,639
I can drink more

74
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,199
No more drinking

75
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:35,720
You can drink

76
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,000
You're the best drinker

77
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,959
Careful, careful

78
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:40,519
Slow down

79
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,720
Bai Xiaojie

80
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,439
It's not what you think

81
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:44,920
Where are they?

82
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,240
Boss, that girl's drunk

83
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,920
Young Master Sun took her

84
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,639
She's drunk

85
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,480
Stop acting noble

86
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:24,319
Now you're beneath me

87
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,680
Such a pretty thing

88
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,439
Won't waste on Laifu

89
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:54,399
Don't worry

90
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:56,959
I'll treat you well

91
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:07,879
Let her go!

92
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:14,680
Who are you?

93
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:15,480
Bai Xiaojie

94
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,319
Are you crazy?

95
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,680
Know who my father is?

96
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:21,879
Don't you know yourself?

97
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:28,199
So it's you

98
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,000
Get lost!

99
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,639
I'm in a good mood today.

100
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,279
I'll spare your miserable life.

101
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:41,560
My father is the police chief.

102
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,839
Go ahead, shoot me.

103
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,399
If he finds out,

104
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,639
do you think he'll let you go?

105
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,360
Shoot! Go on, shoot!

106
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:57,600
Fine.

107
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,839
I don't need this to beat you.

108
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,519
If your father won't teach you, I will.

109
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,279
This is for your lustful heart.

110
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:07,360
This is for your despicable acts.

111
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,720
This is for your beastly nature.

112
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:10,600
This is for your wicked mind.

113
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:11,800
Darn it!

114
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:13,000
Don't hit me.

115
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,920
Don't hit me, Laifu.

116
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,680
Stop hitting me.

117
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:17,519
Miss Bai.

118
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,000
Come.

119
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:23,519
Xiao Wei, wake up.

120
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,399
Let's go.

121
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:25,879
We're going home.

122
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:27,879
Take it easy.

123
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,120
Laifu.

124
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,440
I knew you'd come save me.

125
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,440
You're the best.

126
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:50,919
You know,

127
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:53,080
when you're like this,

128
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,559
you're actually quite cute.

129
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,720
What are you doing?

130
00:08:58,919 --> 00:08:59,360
No, I feel sick.

131
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:00,519
Wait, hold on, just a bit longer.

132
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:01,320
Come on.

133
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:02,360
Easy, take it slow.

134
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,879
Feeling better?

135
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:23,240
I'm fine now.

136
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:23,879
There.

137
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:35,759
All better.

138
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:37,840
Miss, young miss.

139
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:39,120
These are my new clothes.

140
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:42,320
I didn't throw up.

141
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:43,679
I know you didn't.

142
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,480
Get on.

143
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,039
Stop touching.

144
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:58,519
You've worked hard.

145
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,440
Thank you for your trouble.

146
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:01,720
Why so polite all of a sudden?

147
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,799
Is it because I'm willful

148
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,799
that you don't like me?

149
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,600
Then...

150
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:12,360
I'll listen to you from now on, okay?

151
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:14,559
Can you stop losing your temper?

152
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:16,639
Yes, sir.

153
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,519
Come on, go to sleep.

154
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,120
I need to go back.

155
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,960
Laifu.

156
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,879
Laifu.

157
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,679
You're so handsome.

158
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:07,960
There, there.

159
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,039
No more fooling around.

160
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,120
Time to sleep.

161
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:01,000
I beg all immortals,

162
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,720
Buddha bless me.

163
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,120
Father.

164
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:10,159
It's me.

165
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,679
I'm Da Wa.

166
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:19,480
Open the door.

167
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:22,919
Father.

168
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:25,320
It's me.

169
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:27,960
Go away! I'm Da Wa.

170
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,759
Don't come in.

171
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:32,639
Father.

172
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,639
Open the door!

173
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,080
Don't come in! You...

174
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,759
I'm Da Wa! You... hurry...

175
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,639
Go away!

176
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,200
Go away, father!

177
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:42,840
It's me.

178
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:44,960
I'm Da Wa.

179
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:47,919
Father.

180
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,879
It's me! Go!

181
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:51,720
Get away!

182
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:53,039
Don't come closer.

183
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:54,679
I'm Da Wa.

184
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:57,759
Quick!

185
00:12:58,279 --> 00:12:59,919
It's me.

186
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:02,200
Don't.

187
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:03,440
Father.

188
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,559
Hurry, go!

189
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:06,360
Father.

190
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,200
Father.
