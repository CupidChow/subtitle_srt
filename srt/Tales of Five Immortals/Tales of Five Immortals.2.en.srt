1
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:34,640
The temple embodies celestial laws

2
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,200
Where cosmic principles converge

3
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,159
You're awake

4
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:20,639
You...

5
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,319
Why did you bring me here?

6
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,639
Darn it

7
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:25,120
No no no

8
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:26,319
Don't cry, I mean...

9
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:27,439
I saved you

10
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,960
Why are you crying now?

11
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,479
Thank you for rescuing me

12
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:33,400
But offending The Immortal Huang Xian...

13
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,319
If anything happens to the village

14
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,879
My family will suffer

15
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,280
What will happen to my parents?

16
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,199
Miss...

17
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:48,639
Give it back

18
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:50,520
Can I ask you something?

19
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:52,280
Why does your village...

20
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:54,680
fear The Immortal Huang Xian so much?

21
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:56,199
It's not fear...

22
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,520
but reverence

23
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:59,560
They say long ago...

24
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:00,840
our entire village...

25
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:02,560
was saved by The Immortal Huang Xian

26
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,280
When plague struck our village

27
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:10,560
Our healer searched in vain for medicine

28
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:14,080
Until one night...

29
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:18,439
he got lost in the graveyard

30
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,319
Where is this place?

31
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,039
This isn't the way I came

32
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:46,400
Great Immortal...

33
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:47,240
spare me

34
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,080
Great Immortal, have mercy

35
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,439
Do I look human to you?

36
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,039
Great Immortal...

37
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,560
I beg for your mercy

38
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,960
Do I look human to you?

39
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:03,240
Yes! Yes!

40
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,039
Thank you

41
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,520
Take this herb...

42
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,360
as repayment for your kindness

43
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:12,599
Brew it into tea

44
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,520
Thank you, Great Immortal

45
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,279
The healer brought it back to cure the village

46
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:23,319
To everyone's surprise...

47
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,399
all the villagers...

48
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:25,879
miraculously recovered

49
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:26,879
So...

50
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:28,519
we built the Yellow Immortal Temple

51
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:29,519
and worship there ever since

52
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,279
The Immortal Huang Xian saved us

53
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:36,759
That's why every bride...

54
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
spends her first night at the temple

55
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,639
To pray for fertility...

56
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:43,000
and good fortune

57
00:04:59,079 --> 00:04:59,720
We've got news

58
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:00,319
Confirmed

59
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,600
Age and artifacts match

60
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,720
Where is he?

61
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,720
Zhang Village

62
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,439
Good

63
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:09,519
Pack up, we leave now

64
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:10,439
Miss...

65
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:12,040
If it's really Laifu...

66
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,040
what will you do?

67
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,040
Kill him

68
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,040
The Immortal Huang Xian is angry!

69
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,079
We failed to deliver the new bride

70
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,319
Calm your wrath, Great Immortal

71
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:29,079
We beg your forgiveness

72
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,199
Have mercy upon us

73
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,800
I hear The Immortal Huang Xian causes trouble here

74
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,199
Who's this stranger?

75
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,199
The Immortal Huang is a weasel who attained immortality

76
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,120
When angered, he merely haunts people

77
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,399
causing temporary madness

78
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,759
Since when does he kill?

79
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,639
And you are...?

80
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,040
From the House of Bai

81
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:49,319
The Bai family

82
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,680
The Bai family's young mistress

83
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,399
Ah! The Bai heiress!

84
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,360
We're honored by your visit

85
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,120
What brings you to our humble village?

86
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:01,519
You're the village head?

87
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,560
Yes, I am

88
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,439
I seek someone named Laifu

89
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,560
Have you seen him?

90
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,040
Laifu?

91
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:07,879
Village head!

92
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,399
Chief!

93
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:12,439
Something terrible happened!

94
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,079
What's wrong?

95
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:15,920
Last night while sleeping...

96
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,399
I heard a rooster crow

97
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,680
When I went to check...

98
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,160
Mother!

99
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,319
What are you doing at night?

100
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,079
Mom

101
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,000
What are you doing?

102
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,120
Mom

103
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,639
Mom

104
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,160
Mom

105
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,399
The Immortal Huang Xian is punishing us

106
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,319
No one can escape

107
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:18,920
It must be the Immortal Huang Xian's wrath

108
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:20,199
Possessed my mother

109
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,240
Village chief

110
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,959
That guy must have kidnapped Wanting

111
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,199
The Immortal Huang Xian is angry

112
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:26,560
Where is he anyway?

113
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,439
Who knows?

114
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:28,839
So many people

115
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,360
Waiting for me?

116
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,040
You finally came back

117
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:34,040
It's him

118
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,720
He's the one who took Wanting

119
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:38,759
Seems like a lot happened yesterday

120
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,079
So you're the troublemaker

121
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,519
Using the Immortal Huang Xian's name to cause chaos

122
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,199
Did you hurt Wanting?

123
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:46,959
Tie him up for the Immortal Huang Xian

124
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:47,560
No

125
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:48,720
Catch him

126
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,360
Don't run

127
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:50,480
I'm really trying to help you

128
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,480
I didn't take her

129
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:52,240
Tie him up

130
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,199
It's all your fault

131
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:56,000
Save him?

132
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,800
It's all on you, it's him

133
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:01,879
What are you doing?

134
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,920
Offended the Immortal Huang Xian

135
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:04,319
How dare you

136
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,959
Don't judge by my skinny appearance

137
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,519
I actually have some weight

138
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,639
Right, right

139
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,519
Gently, gently

140
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,240
Easy now

141
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:21,879
Careful

142
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,439
What if you hurt him?

143
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:24,519
Exactly

144
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,199
Oh great immortal

145
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,959
This young man is from out of town

146
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,839
Doesn't know our village customs

147
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,159
If he sincerely apologizes

148
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,000
Please spare him this once

149
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,360
No

150
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:45,399
No matter what you hear later

151
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:46,799
Don't open your eyes

152
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:48,679
Keep them closed to survive

153
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,200
Where are you going?

154
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,080
Groom

155
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,399
Eternal happiness

156
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,600
Groom

157
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,360
Good match

158
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,720
Congratulations

159
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:21,559
Great joy

160
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:24,200
Cheers

161
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,720
Good fortune

162
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:31,399
Cheers

163
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,240
Congratulations

164
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,440
Perfect couple

165
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:40,919
Match made in heaven

166
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,720
Cheers

167
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:52,120
Groom

168
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,600
Why are you so late?

169
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,480
The bride is getting anxious

170
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,879
Wonderful

171
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,279
Congratulations

172
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,360
First bow to heaven and earth

173
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,919
Second bow to parents

174
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,039
Couple bows to each other

175
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,200
Final ritual

176
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,759
Drink the wedding wine

177
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,519
May you stay together till old age

178
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,080
I've played along long enough

179
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,399
Righteous celestial power, light of the Seven Stars!

180
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,000
Evil spirits, scatter with the wind!

181
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:56,279
Still got tricks up your sleeve?

182
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,000
Groom, do you really think you can escape?

183
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,799
I don't care if you're the Immortal Huang Xian or what

184
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,320
Your time is up

185
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,000
Using incense offering as a pretense

186
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,360
Your smoke trick won't fool me

187
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:10,360
So it was you after all

188
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:12,200
You actually broke through my illusion

189
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,600
Not bad for a kid

190
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:15,600
But this time you're in my hands

191
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:17,480
Just your bad luck

192
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:18,960
Do it

193
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,200
You damn old fox

194
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,799
You really want my life?

195
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,159
This is lawless!

196
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:28,120
Complete lawlessness!

197
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:30,120
Here, I am the law!

198
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:31,360
Stop!

199
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,200
He's from the House of Bai

200
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,159
I dare anyone to touch him

201
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,120
Who are you?

202
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,679
Don't you recognize me?

203
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,039
You really don't know?

204
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,919
You dare disrespect the House of Bai?

205
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:47,559
The House of Bai?

206
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,399
This is the mountains - far from the emperor's reach

207
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,080
I'll kill you all and dump you in the ravine

208
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,240
Who can stop me?

209
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:52,759
Attack!

210
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:53,360
You!

211
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,399
Spirits manifest, guided by the Yellow Springs

212
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,720
By my command, wandering souls appear

213
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:57,799
Reveal yourselves now!

214
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,600
Defy me, and face eternal damnation!
