1
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,519
Laifu

2
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:16,920
What are you doing in my room, Laifu?

3
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,640
What are you doing?

4
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,040
What did you do to me last night?

5
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:24,599
Speak!

6
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:27,680
Miss Bai, I must say...

7
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:29,920
Perhaps you should look at yourself first.

8
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,599
Your clothes are perfectly neat from head to toe.

9
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:32,879
What could I possibly have done?

10
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,040
I...

11
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:37,400
I should be asking you!

12
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,519
You held me so tightly...

13
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:40,120
What were you trying to do?

14
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:42,840
I held you?

15
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:44,879
How could I possibly have held you?

16
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:48,840
Even if... even if I did hold you...

17
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,359
Don't you have your own room?

18
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,879
Couldn't you have walked back yourself?

19
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,920
You held me so tightly...

20
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,959
How could I move?

21
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,480
I...

22
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,079
I held you that tightly?

23
00:01:59,319 --> 00:01:59,799
I...

24
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:02,959
Miss, Officer Gu is here to see Young Master Laifu.

25
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,280
The young master isn't in his room.

26
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:05,840
Understood.

27
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:09,719
You had her come looking for you again?

28
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,280
This time it really wasn't me.

29
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:14,800
There was a murder here last night.

30
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:16,639
Though it's already been closed - not by me.

31
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,319
But...

32
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:23,319
I suspect it's related to the Serpent Immortal.

33
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:24,919
Master Bai isn't here.

34
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,400
So we must ask you, the new head, to help.

35
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,080
Wasn't it already closed?

36
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,719
That's the official conclusion.

37
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,599
But personally, I believe...

38
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,759
Someone must be...

39
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:39,800
...using the immortal's name to commit crimes.

40
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,520
Crime scene.

41
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,039
Unauthorized personnel, don't touch anything.

42
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:48,800
Step aside.

43
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,560
Let's go, this way.

44
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:21,879
The deceased is named Gao Shan.

45
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:24,000
When we found him...

46
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,039
...he was curled up completely.

47
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,159
His skin was festering...

48
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,800
His entire body...

49
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,560
...as if hiding from something.

50
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,240
Where was the body found?

51
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,639
Cause of death?

52
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:43,680
Asphyxiation.

53
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:47,639
No signs of forced entry.

54
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,719
Orders from above...

55
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,319
...to rule it a suicide.

56
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:52,840
Suicide?

57
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,120
In that condition...

58
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,520
...and they call it suicide?

59
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,520
Your police work is quite lax, isn't it?

60
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,039
What?

61
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,039
That's why I must investigate personally.

62
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:04,800
Officer Gu...

63
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:07,840
Did he have any family or friends?

64
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:10,280
His wife died in childbirth.

65
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,280
His only son...

66
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,439
...drowned three days ago.

67
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,839
After his son's death...

68
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,639
...strange things occurred.

69
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:22,839
Strange things?

70
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,199
At Heixiazi Mountain outside town...

71
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:26,600
...there's an abandoned mansion.

72
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,040
Rumored to revive the dead and cure all ills.

73
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,040
Gao Shan took his child there.

74
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:41,560
Master Wei, save my child!

75
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,839
Master Wei!

76
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,160
Master Wei!

77
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,720
Please, save my child!

78
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:51,879
Master Wei!

79
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,240
I beg you, save my child!

80
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:56,800
Chang'an.

81
00:04:58,319 --> 00:04:59,240
Go see.

82
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:02,920
Yes.

83
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,319
The dead cannot return.

84
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,839
Yet this Master claims there's a way.

85
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,519
Only this method...

86
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,000
The dead cannot return to life.

87
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,399
This believer, please return.

88
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:38,279
Master Wei

89
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,040
He's my only child.

90
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,240
I'll give you all my possessions.

91
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,439
It's not about money.

92
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:46,680
Life and death are fated.

93
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,600
To defy heaven's will...

94
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:50,639
brings calamity.

95
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:53,519
Please, save my child.

96
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:54,879
Please help me.

97
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:56,480
Save my child.

98
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,839
There is a way...

99
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,920
but it requires your lifespan.

100
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:05,959
Agreeable?

101
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,120
If it saves my child,

102
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:08,800
I'll do anything.

103
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,639
To save all from suffering

104
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,920
is my sacred duty.

105
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,680
Heaven has its ways,

106
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,319
earth its spirits.

107
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:30,079
Yin yang displaced,

108
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,120
fate overturned.

109
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:35,920
This life for that life.

110
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,600
Folklore says

111
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,800
snakes bridge worlds.

112
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:56,120
They say Master Wei

113
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,800
commands snakes to steal life.

114
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,040
Dawa, you're awake.

115
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,680
Listen.

116
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,720
Chant this all the way home:

117
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:43,560
"Departed soul, swiftly return."

118
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:44,920
Remember:

119
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,439
Before reaching home,

120
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:48,199
no matter what happens

121
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,040
or what you hear,

122
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,120
never look back.

123
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,639
This is vital.

124
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:54,920
Understood.

125
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,199
I know.

126
00:07:57,639 --> 00:07:59,319
"Departed soul, swiftly return."

127
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,439
"Departed soul, swiftly return."

128
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,439
"Departed soul, swiftly return."

129
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:07,839
"Departed soul, swiftly return."

130
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:10,480
"Departed soul, swiftly return."

131
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,800
"Departed soul, swiftly return."

132
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,639
Father...

133
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:15,720
I'm cold.

134
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:20,399
Can't look back.

135
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,160
"Departed soul, swiftly return."

136
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:25,160
Father... "Departed soul..."

137
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:26,680
I'm tired.

138
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:29,519
Just rest... no looking back.

139
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,959
"Departed soul..." Father...

140
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,679
Father!

141
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,159
Father! Help! "Departed..."

142
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,080
They're taking me!

143
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,440
Father!

144
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:39,480
Dawa!

145
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:41,440
Dawa!

146
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:47,480
Father!

147
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,480
Father!

148
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:49,879
Father! I'm scared!

149
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,960
Quick! Take me home!

150
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:52,600
Father!

151
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,039
Soon after returning,

152
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,000
Gaoshan died.

153
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:00,799
In our Northeast,

154
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,399
snakes becoming immortals

155
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:08,960
are called Serpent Immortals.

156
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:12,159
Those who commune with them

157
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:13,279
are Shamans.

158
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,279
But

159
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,159
we've never heard

160
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,120
of raising the dead.

161
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,519
To learn Master Wei's tricks,

162
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,120
let's investigate.

163
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:26,960
I know the location.

164
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,240
Wait.

165
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:31,679
Going directly is too obvious.

166
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,759
We'll be spotted.

167
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,840
What's our cover?

168
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,600
I've got it.

169
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,159
Master Wei "cures all ills," right?

170
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:41,600
Someone can fake illness.

171
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:42,679
Fake illness?

172
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:44,399
Who'll do it?

173
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,799
I serve the Serpent Immortal,

174
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,840
blessed with power

175
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:07,200
to cure all ailments

176
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,039
and ease worldly pains.

177
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,440
May your hearts be kind.

178
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:24,840
Gaoshan attended this gathering.

179
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,960
Master Wei's words

180
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,519
sound convincing.

181
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:30,919
Don't listen to his words,

182
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:32,840
watch his actions.

183
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:34,600
Right.

184
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,799
My leg is healed.

185
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,200
Even a decade-old ailment can be cured.

186
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:55,639
I can stand up.

187
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:57,440
I can stand up.

188
00:11:57,559 --> 00:11:58,759
The Great Immortal has manifested!

189
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,679
The Great Immortal has manifested!

190
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,519
The Great Immortal has manifested!

191
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,519
The Great Immortal has manifested!

192
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,399
The Great Immortal has manifested!

193
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:09,720
The Great Immortal has manifested!

194
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:11,759
Bless us, Great Immortal.

195
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,360
Master Wei.

196
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:14,799
Master Wei.

197
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,279
Young man,

198
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:21,200
this is your first time here, right?

199
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:23,240
No worries.

200
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,080
You're now one of us.

201
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,080
Master Wei.

202
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:29,919
My husband has been sickly since childhood.

203
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:31,720
It's been so long.

204
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:33,320
Could you please examine him?

205
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,519
Master Wei can only heal one person per day.

206
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:38,039
If you seek treatment,

207
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,360
you must wait.

208
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,399
How long must we wait?

209
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:44,159
If there's a chance,

210
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,399
you'll get your turn.

211
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:49,000
No, we truly can't wait any longer.

212
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,159
Let's go.

213
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,320
My mother is gravely ill.

214
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,960
The doctor says she won't last long.

215
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:21,720
Please, have mercy and save my mother.

216
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,679
I've brought money - all the money.

217
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,240
I've said it many times,

218
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,279
your case isn't about money.

219
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,399
As the saying goes, life and death are fated.

220
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,279
If I arrange treatment for you early,

221
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:37,840
it might affect

222
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:39,919
other devotees' lives.

223
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:42,000
I... I...

224
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:44,480
You should wait in line.

225
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,279
I know this is wrong,

226
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,919
but I must save my mother.

227
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:52,320
We only have each other.

228
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:53,519
If she dies,

229
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,200
I can't go on living.

230
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,200
Master Wei, I beg you.

231
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,639
Please save my mother.

232
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,919
I beg you, Master Wei.

233
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,360
I beg you.

234
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:04,279
I beg you.

235
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:05,559
Come back later.
