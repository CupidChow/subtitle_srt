1
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,280
Paint on red makeup

2
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,439
Become your bride

3
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,759
Break a willow branch

4
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,120
Stay by your side

5
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:31,039
Borrow a beam of sunlight

6
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:34,400
Warm my heart

7
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,000
Paint on red makeup

8
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,080
Become your bride

9
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:40,280
Ziyan

10
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:41,960
It's not me who wanted to disturb you

11
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:44,000
They forced me to come here

12
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,479
If you want to take someone, take them

13
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:47,120
Don't take me, sister

14
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,560
This...

15
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:07,000
What's going on?

16
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:14,599
This is Mirage Powder

17
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,920
Mirage Powder

18
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,480
Seems someone feared Ziyan would be forgotten

19
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,079
So they pulled these tricks

20
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,160
What does this have to do with me?

21
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,279
I had no grudge against her

22
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,120
If she returns, she should go after Hong Jie

23
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:29,680
Why come for me?

24
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:32,839
Hong Jie

25
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:35,680
Well...

26
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:38,600
Boss Hu was originally Hong Jie's client

27
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,360
Until Ziyan stole him away

28
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:43,759
Hong Jie hated her to the bone

29
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:45,279
Wanted to devour her alive

30
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,079
Now that Ziyan's dead

31
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:49,360
Hong Jie is the happiest

32
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,199
But her joy means nothing

33
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:53,240
Clients spoiled by Ziyan's charms

34
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:55,319
Won't return to her anyway

35
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,720
Hong Jie despises Ziyan

36
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Paint on red makeup, become your bride

37
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:10,279
Break a willow branch, stay by your side

38
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:12,079
Borrow a beam of sunlight

39
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:14,959
That voice doesn't sound ghostly

40
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:16,879
Let's go check

41
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:23,000
Waiting for your return to see flowers bloom

42
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:29,680
Fold a paper crane to accompany you afar

43
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,079
Ziyan! Ziyan has returned!

44
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:34,199
No...

45
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:35,480
Why is she wearing Ziyan's dress?

46
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:36,399
Hong Jie

47
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,639
Ziyan used to sing this song often

48
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,639
Could Ziyan really have returned?

49
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:41,959
Hong Jie

50
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,079
Hong Jie's losing her mind

51
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:45,240
How terrifying

52
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:46,839
Hong Jie, wake up!

53
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,519
Hong Jie

54
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,160
Is Hong Jie okay?

55
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,040
What happened?

56
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,560
Hong Jie

57
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,879
Hong Jie, wake up!

58
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:07,480
Hong Jie

59
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:08,399
Let me help you up, Hong Jie

60
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,519
Ziyan's paper crane

61
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,720
Ziyan, you little witch

62
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,959
You stole my men when alive

63
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,240
Now dead, you still haunt me

64
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,040
What's it to me that you got dumped?

65
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:27,759
Go haunt the men if you can

66
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,480
Ziyan got dumped?

67
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:32,120
Wasn't Ziyan's death suicide?

68
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,319
This matter might not be so simple

69
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,040
Why would she kill herself for no reason?

70
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,879
She was just too proud

71
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:41,720
Men come and go in nightclubs

72
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,720
It's all just acting for the moment

73
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,920
Foolish to think they'd marry us

74
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,240
What was she thinking?

75
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:51,600
Ziyan, let me tell you

76
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,639
You've got the wrong person

77
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,439
If you dare haunt me again

78
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,000
I'll scatter your ashes

79
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,600
I'll haunt you back as a ghost

80
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,519
Let me ask you

81
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:02,040
Who did Ziyan associate with most?

82
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:03,720
You answer so readily

83
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:05,639
Not giving others benefits

84
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:09,839
All given to you

85
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:13,639
Tell me something useful

86
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,600
I'll frequent your business later

87
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:21,680
Follow me.

88
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,759
Back then,

89
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,959
I was the most popular dancer at the Grand World.

90
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:30,120
Everyone had to call me Hong Jie.

91
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,720
Until one day,

92
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:33,800
a girl named Ziyan arrived.

93
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:36,120
When Ziyan first came,

94
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,639
she was just a schoolgirl.

95
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:38,759
Knew nothing about this world.

96
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,160
But this girl,

97
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:41,800
was born for this business.

98
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:44,319
Talented, street-smart,

99
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:45,800
a quick learner.

100
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,480
Hello, Hong Jie.

101
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,240
Hello.

102
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,720
Hong Jie, you look gorgeous today.

103
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,360
Your hair looks wonderful today.

104
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:51,879
Hong Jie, hello Hong Jie.

105
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:56,920
Hong Jie, Hong Jie.

106
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:58,000
You're here. You look stunning today.

107
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,199
So beautiful. Alright.

108
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:03,639
Hong Jie.

109
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,040
Hong Jie.

110
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:09,000
This girl is Ziyan.

111
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,399
She's your responsibility now.

112
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,680
Teach her well.

113
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:13,480
Why come here?

114
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:16,319
What else?

115
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,720
Hard times, just trying to survive.

116
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,560
Make money while I'm still young.

117
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:24,160
What can you do?

118
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:25,639
I...

119
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,279
I don't know anything.

120
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,879
But I can learn.

121
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:31,240
Learn?

122
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,799
This business isn't easy to learn.

123
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:37,279
Must swallow your pride, take risks.

124
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,279
Hong Jie.

125
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,759
Come with me.

126
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,440
Go on.

127
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:10,279
Ziyan was smart, young,

128
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,919
learned everything quickly.

129
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:13,840
Rose through the ranks fast.

130
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,200
I hated her.

131
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,480
I was jealous.

132
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:19,919
But what could I do?

133
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,039
Had to accept it.

134
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,960
Good.

135
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:56,639
Ziyan became more popular.

136
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,039
Men spent fortunes

137
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,399
just to see her.

138
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,240
A saying spread among clients:

139
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,879
"Ziyan is the Thousand-Faced Fox."

140
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:08,320
Every man saw

141
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:09,960
a different Ziyan.

142
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,360
We've all been popular.

143
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:14,679
I know that fame too well.

144
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:17,799
When everyone surrounds you,

145
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,759
you feel like an empty shell.

146
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,720
I filled myself with money.

147
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:26,879
But Ziyan fell for a man.

148
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:29,759
Our profession's greatest taboo.

149
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,759
Loving a client.

150
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,600
Ziyan crossed the line.

151
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,159
Who was this man?

152
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,399
His identity doesn't matter.

153
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:53,759
What matters is,

154
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:56,879
to keep his love, Ziyan

155
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,200
soon sought the fox spirit's blessing.

156
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,399
Graceful white fox, with nine majestic tails.

157
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,080
Bless my home, honor my guest as king.

158
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,559
Build my household, make us prosper.

159
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,679
Between heaven and earth, let this be done.
