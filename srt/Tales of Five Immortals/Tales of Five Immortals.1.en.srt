1
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,480
This matter today

2
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,000
begins in Zhangjia Zhuang

3
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:10,359
In the Northeast region

4
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,000
there's a legend

5
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:12,959
Fox

6
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,079
Yellow

7
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:15,040
White

8
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,120
Willow

9
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:17,000
Gray

10
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:20,480
Five creatures absorbing nature's essence

11
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:22,359
cultivated into immortals

12
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,760
known as The Five Immortals

13
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,040
And this Zhangjia Zhuang

14
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,840
worships the Yellow Immortal

15
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,400
The auspicious hour arrives

16
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:51,680
Chicken blood spills, great fortune comes

17
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:58,000
Yellow Immortal escorts, feet never touch ground

18
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:03,120
Sudden wealth, all wishes fulfilled

19
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:09,080
Bride and groom, time to depart

20
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,360
Zhangjia Zhuang has a tradition

21
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,879
All brides-to-be

22
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,639
must stay at Yellow Immortal Temple one night

23
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,120
My dear, don't be afraid

24
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:24,039
Our village's brides

25
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,719
all spend one night at the temple

26
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,120
to seek Yellow Immortal's blessing

27
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,080
for prosperous offspring

28
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:29,639
At dawn tomorrow

29
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:30,879
I'll come fetch you

30
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,719
Auspicious day, heaven and earth rejoice

31
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,199
Yellow Immortal blesses with wealth

32
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:44,400
Clear sky, bright sun and moon

33
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,240
New couple's descendants bring fortune

34
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:52,439
The auspicious hour has come

35
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,919
Bride enters the hall

36
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,039
First bow to heaven and earth

37
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,919
Second bow to Yellow Immortal

38
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:05,000
Couple bows to each other

39
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:09,879
Wedding ceremony complete

40
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:15,199
Tonight you'll receive Yellow Immortal's blessing

41
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,039
From now on, favorable weather

42
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,719
and carefree life

43
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:35,879
Who's peeking outside?

44
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:37,279
Revealing our divine secrets

45
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,399
My dear

46
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:50,560
How could she have died?

47
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:53,480
I heard she offended the Yellow Immortal.

48
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,920
She died kneeling outside the temple.

49
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:55,639
Isn't that right?

50
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,240
They say she couldn't lie down in death.

51
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:58,839
Her posture was extremely strange.

52
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,759
This is truly...

53
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,000
She must have angered the Yellow Immortal. How could she die?

54
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:01,959
She was punished by divine retribution.

55
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,759
How could this happen?

56
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:05,399
What terrible misfortune.

57
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,639
It's all that Zhang Xiucai's fault.

58
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,000
He lingered after the wedding ceremony.

59
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,160
That's why he angered the Yellow Immortal.

60
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,120
That's why the Yellow Immortal punished us.

61
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:15,839
Enough! He got what he deserved.

62
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,519
It's starting, look!

63
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:23,839
No god shall disobey, no ghost shall resist.

64
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,040
By the power vested in me.

65
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,519
Begone!

66
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:31,839
I'm exhausted.

67
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,839
Where did this insolent brat come from?

68
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:38,120
Daring to disrupt our ritual!

69
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,120
Throw him out!

70
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:42,639
Honorable Taoist priest...

71
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,279
I sincerely apologize.

72
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,600
Honorable elders...

73
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,519
My apologies.

74
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,240
Please don't be angry.

75
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:50,480
I was just passing through.

76
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:51,519
Looking for some food.

77
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,079
I got too tired on the way.

78
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,399
Fell asleep in this coffin.

79
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,480
Please forgive me.

80
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,800
Who sleeps in a coffin?

81
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:57,480
What bad luck.

82
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:59,000
Get lost! We're conducting a ritual.

83
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,040
Honorable priest, you see...

84
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,560
Get out now!

85
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,319
I said get out!

86
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,160
Don't interfere with our ritual.

87
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,399
You dare blaspheme the Yellow Immortal?

88
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:06,800
The Yellow Immortal won't spare you.

89
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,439
Get out!

90
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:08,480
Out!

91
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,120
Go!

92
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:10,600
Young man...

93
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:13,120
Take this food and leave quickly.

94
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:14,480
This is no place to linger.

95
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,680
Thank you, miss.

96
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,160
Get lost now!

97
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:22,720
In my opinion...

98
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,480
An evil spirit has entered your home.

99
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:27,959
This demon has powerful magic.

100
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,160
Likely a mountain spirit.

101
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:32,439
You're right, priest.

102
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,600
My son offended the Yellow Immortal.

103
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:37,160
My daughter-in-law remains kneeling.

104
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,759
We can't even bury her.

105
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,759
The Yellow Immortal has cultivated for millennia.

106
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:44,360
I could battle it...

107
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:45,839
But...

108
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:48,319
It would cost me years of my life.

109
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,680
This matter...

110
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:51,759
Don't worry.

111
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,800
We'll compensate you.

112
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:55,959
These days...

113
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:57,560
Morals are declining.

114
00:06:58,439 --> 00:06:59,959
Some amateur with half-baked skills...

115
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:01,680
Can go around swindling people.

116
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:02,800
You brat!

117
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:04,560
Watch your words!

118
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:06,360
Beware heavenly punishment.

119
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:08,959
You swindle without fear of divine retribution.

120
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,360
But I do fear it!

121
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:11,959
You!

122
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:13,319
What's this?

123
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,639
What is this thing?

124
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:15,399
Fellow villagers!

125
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,399
These tricks aren't special.

126
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,920
This contains white phosphorus.

127
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:20,680
Shake it fast to create fire.

128
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:22,959
Fake priest!

129
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:24,199
Stop your charlatan tricks.

130
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,000
You dare expose me?

131
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,720
You must want to die.

132
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:30,240
Try my ghost-binding rope!

133
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:32,120
Made for demons like you!

134
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,839
First swing - heavenly soldiers block!

135
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,680
Second swing - earth spirits stabilize!

136
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,160
Third swing - no escape!

137
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:44,160
Fourth swing - golden rope obey!

138
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:49,040
Master!

139
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:49,800
Capture!

140
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,360
Young Taoist

141
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,439
I've sealed your acupoints

142
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,560
For seven days you won't speak

143
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,519
Nor stand on your feet

144
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,199
After seven days it'll return

145
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,279
But if I catch you then

146
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:05,639
Still deceiving people again

147
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,319
You'll face my wrath

148
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,439
Go now

149
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,560
Master, let's go

150
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:12,360
Move aside

151
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:18,360
Young immortal

152
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,240
Please help us

153
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,160
Very well

154
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,000
Show me the corpse first

155
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,759
Madam

156
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,519
Strange death, yet no wounds

157
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,000
Someone must've tampered

158
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,639
Rope marks on her wrists

159
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:17,320
Deep strangulation marks

160
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:19,559
This all proves

161
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,600
She was restrained before death

162
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:24,960
Not the Yellow Immortal's work

163
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:26,120
This was human

164
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:37,039
Who's impersonating the Immortal?

165
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:06,919
Villagers

166
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,279
This isn't divine punishment

167
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,519
It's murder

168
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,840
Murder

169
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:14,840
Murder!

170
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,960
Young man, stop your nonsense

171
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,200
The village chief comes

172
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,080
Chief! Chief! Chief!

173
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:23,720
Young man

174
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:26,600
Our village has been blessed
for decades

175
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:28,879
That plague twenty years ago

176
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:30,080
You all remember?

177
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:30,440
We remember

178
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,240
If we offend the Immortal

179
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,919
Our whole village will perish

180
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:33,960
Chief

181
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:36,840
Please find us a solution

182
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:40,200
There is one way

183
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:43,919
Scholar Zhang

184
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,720
You must remarry

185
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,200
Only this can appease the Immortal

186
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,399
You - get down

187
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:55,919
You rascal

188
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,919
Quite strong, aren't you?

189
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,159
Coward! Get down!

190
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,080
Coward!

191
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:00,679
Mother

192
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:01,799
Don't do this

193
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,559
Get down

194
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,600
Coward!

195
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,240
This disaster

196
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,240
Was caused by your family

197
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,480
This burden

198
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,240
Your family must bear today

199
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:11,440
Scholar Zhang

200
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,120
You caused this trouble

201
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:17,639
You must resolve it

202
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:20,480
By village tradition

203
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:22,399
We'll draw lots to decide

204
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,039
What should we do?

205
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:33,279
This...

206
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,720
What can we do?

207
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:39,600
Drawn!

208
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:40,519
What was drawn?

209
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:43,320
What was drawn?!

210
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,159
The eighth day of fourth month

211
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,559
No!

212
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:49,279
Mother!

213
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,080
How could it be me?

214
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,440
WanTing is my sister

215
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:53,480
I can't marry her

216
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:55,200
Scholar Zhang, see?

217
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:57,120
The Immortal's will

218
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,000
I can't oppose it

219
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:00,360
You see?

220
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:03,399
Fascinating

221
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:06,279
Your village is quite special

222
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:07,960
Taking a bride

223
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:10,000
Must sleep at the temple first

224
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:11,240
Tell me

225
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,120
Is this divine punishment

226
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:15,759
Or your own guilty conscience?

227
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,759
Villagers!

228
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,919
Let's drive out this outsider

229
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,919
Who disrespects our Immortal

230
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:21,559
Yes!

231
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,399
Get out!

232
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,279
Drive him out!

233
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:23,919
Wait!

234
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:24,639
No!

235
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,480
I'm trying to help you!

236
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:27,279
Get out!

237
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:29,000
This is murder!

238
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,200
Murder!

239
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,960
The auspicious hour comes

240
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:29,720
The Yellow Immortal's Wedding, the bride sets off

241
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:34,919
Evil spirits lurk, bystanders retreat
