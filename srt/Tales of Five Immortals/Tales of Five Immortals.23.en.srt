1
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,879
My men planted bombs in Baixian Villa.

2
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:20,879
If none of you fear death,

3
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:22,719
feel free to keep causing trouble.

4
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,760
An early death means early relief.

5
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,239
You shameless bastards!

6
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,079
Your fate is sealed - this is heaven's will.

7
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:33,359
Even if you could defy fate,

8
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:35,439
heaven wouldn't allow it.

9
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,439
And you rich people -

10
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,719
open your damned eyes and see!

11
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:43,640
The people are suffering,

12
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:47,959
yet you hide here seeking immortality.

13
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,120
They swindle your money

14
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,959
and harm innocent people,

15
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:55,079
yet you aid their crimes.

16
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,680
You're like a dirty rag

17
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,799
used and discarded.

18
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,519
To this day, you show no remorse.

19
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:05,439
Future generations will despise you.

20
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:08,439
Chun Sheng!

21
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:10,520
Aren't you so powerful?

22
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,800
Today I'll give everyone a chance -

23
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:17,719
whoever wants to leave,

24
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:19,520
stab him once.

25
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,960
Let's see who dares!

26
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,719
Whoever tries will die.

27
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:31,560
What are you doing?

28
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,840
How dare you!

29
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:41,960
Laifu!

30
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,400
Xiao Wei!

31
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:06,280
Xiao Wei!

32
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,120
Wake up!

33
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,240
Don't sleep, Laifu.

34
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:08,919
Talk to me.

35
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,159
It hurts so much.

36
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,240
Am I dying?

37
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:12,919
No!

38
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,000
You won't die.

39
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,000
You're Harbin's greatest Master of Yin and Yang.

40
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,759
I'm no Master of Yin and Yang.

41
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,280
Then what are you?

42
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,280
I'm your fiancée.

43
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,840
If he really is Young Master Laifu,

44
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,960
what will you do?

45
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,639
Kill him.

46
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,560
Who are you?

47
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:30,840
Don't you recognize me?

48
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:33,680
You really don't remember?

49
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,039
What body, what promise?

50
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:35,560
Exactly!

51
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:36,280
You can't marry him.

52
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,199
This is my fiancé - it's inappropriate.

53
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:38,479
See, I'm her fian-

54
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,439
fiancé.

55
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,719
Can you stop losing your temper?

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,719
Yes, sir.

57
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,520
Laifu.

58
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,879
You're so handsome.

59
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,199
Doctor!

60
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,240
Quick, get a doctor!

61
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:39,040
Put her here.

62
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:41,120
Xiao Wei, stay awake.

63
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:41,920
Xiao Wei!

64
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:45,279
Don't sleep, Xiao Wei!

65
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:48,279
Xiao Wei!

66
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:51,759
Sir, leave it to us.

67
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,439
No entry!

68
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:53,879
Xiao Wei!

69
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:54,959
Xiao Wei!

70
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:05,160
Don't worry.

71
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,800
You survived severe injuries,

72
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:10,199
so can she.

73
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:48,639
Dinner time!

74
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,160
Hurry up!

75
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:10,199
Still thinking about eating?

76
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:12,120
A scumbag like you

77
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,079
deserves this fate.

78
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,639
Young man,

79
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,399
don't speak too soon.

80
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,639
People

81
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:20,839
have ups and downs.

82
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,839
Still hoping to rise?

83
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,680
No one can predict these things.

84
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,959
Just wait to die then.

85
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,800
Officer Gu.

86
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:18,959
Her condition

87
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:21,480
is worse than I thought.

88
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:32,680
She hates you most,

89
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:34,480
so visit often.

90
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,920
Anger might wake her.

91
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:43,240
Without her bothering me,

92
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,000
I feel unaccustomed.

93
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:54,839
What's your plan?

94
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,519
If she never wakes,

95
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,560
just staying here

96
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,360
isn't a solution.

97
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,319
I promised Master Bai to care for her.

98
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,040
In her current state,

99
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,240
I can't leave.

100
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,519
The masterminds behind this have all been captured.

101
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:23,480
Chun Sheng has confessed to his crimes.

102
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:26,839
Only Third Master Bai

103
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,800
managed to escape through a secret passage that night.

104
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,000
Actually,

105
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,039
I've been meaning to ask,

106
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,799
all this supernatural stuff Chun Sheng did -

107
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:43,120
was any of it real?

108
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,000
Of course it was fake.

109
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,240
Just some deceptive tricks

110
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,159
and schemes.

111
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,679
He preyed on people's greed.

112
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:56,360
Without greed,

113
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,399
there's nothing to exploit.

114
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,159
There have been several new cases in Spring City recently.

115
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:03,440
Not suicides,

116
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,240
nor homicides.

117
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:07,679
It sounds like

118
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,240
they offended The Otherworldly.

119
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:12,720
Would you be interested

120
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:14,759
in investigating with me?

121
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,639
Don't go!

122
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:23,799
You're awake.

123
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:27,840
If I hadn't woken up,

124
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,440
you'd have left with her.

125
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,080
I'll get the doctor.

126
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:41,799
Here.

127
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,480
Eat your last meal before the execution.

128
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:50,399
Darn it!

129
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,639
The death row inmate escaped!

130
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:53,960
The death row inmate escaped!

131
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:04,519
Laifu.

132
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,559
Officer Gu.

133
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,600
My team found leads on Chun Sheng.

134
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:13,080
Want to work together?

135
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,320
I've also found leads on Chun Sheng.

136
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,200
I still think

137
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,919
working alone is more efficient.

138
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,440
No rush on the partnership.

139
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,480
You know,

140
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:26,279
working with me would be more effective.

141
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,320
My father's old connections

142
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,879
have extensive networks in the Northeast.

143
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:31,120
I know.

144
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,000
I'll probably need your help often.

145
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,799
It's my duty.

146
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:38,799
Officer Gu, this is goodbye.

147
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:39,639
Laifu.

148
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:42,960
You said you were going out,

149
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,320
not with her.

150
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:46,120
You're my fiancé!

151
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,120
I won't let you go alone with another woman.

152
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,279
Shouldn't you be resting?

153
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,320
Why are you here?

154
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,639
Also,

155
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:55,559
I'm not going alone with her.

156
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,720
Second,

157
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:02,440
marriage is a serious matter.

158
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:03,559
We can't be careless about it.

159
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:04,240
You...

160
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:05,240
Finally,

161
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:08,279
this mission is dangerous.

162
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:09,759
It's not safe to bring you.

163
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:10,600
Ungrateful wretch!

164
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:12,000
I'm ungrateful?

165
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:12,840
I don't care!

166
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,679
I'm going with you!

167
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:16,960
Let's go.
