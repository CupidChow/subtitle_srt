1
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,239
Don't move.

2
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,439
Officer Gu.

3
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,599
I already have clothes.

4
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,920
Why buy more?

5
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,079
You're now head of The House of Bai.

6
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:19,599
You need clothes that match your status.

7
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,719
It's necessary.

8
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:23,359
Officer Gu, don't waste your money.

9
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:25,719
These hands...

10
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,439
...have seen their share of storms.

11
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,760
Officer Gu's hands...

12
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:32,680
...are quite remarkable.

13
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,599
No wonder you became a detective so young.

14
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,079
Grew up with guns, didn't you?

15
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,439
Your family must be quite special.

16
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:43,280
You must know Ha Shi well.

17
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,519
I thought you asked me out...

18
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,439
...to get to know each other.

19
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:50,239
Not for this.

20
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,959
This is getting to know you too.

21
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,439
The House of Bai...

22
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,359
...a powerful family in Ha Shi.

23
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,439
I know that much.

24
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,760
Tell me something I don't know.

25
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,879
Then you tell me first...

26
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,520
...what you already know.

27
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:16,240
I'm new here.

28
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:18,919
You're putting me on the spot.

29
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,520
Recent cases all involve The House of Bai.

30
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,240
I have to be suspicious.

31
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,719
Old Bai gave me the family assets...

32
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,240
...but I can tell...

33
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,639
...he doesn't trust me.

34
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,000
You're in The House of Bai...

35
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,919
...and don't know its affairs?

36
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,000
How would an outsider like me know?

37
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,560
I'm caught in this puzzle.

38
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,360
Those involved can't see clearly.

39
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:48,639
Not like you, Officer Gu...

40
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,240
...Ha Shi's top detective.

41
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,719
You must know much more than I do.

42
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:58,120
How about this...

43
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:00,360
Help me solve some cases...

44
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,520
...and I'll tell you...

45
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,039
...whatever you want to know.

46
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,240
Officer Gu.

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,800
You said you'd treat me, right?

48
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:11,280
Right.

49
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,919
First, change your clothes.

50
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,240
Then come to the salon with me.

51
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,879
This restaurant's famous in Ha Shi.

52
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,280
I reserved a table.

53
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,400
You'll see when we get there.

54
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:33,879
Let's go.

55
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:35,520
You...

56
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:41,479
...this table...

57
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:44,879
...I used to sit here often.

58
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,639
Xiao Wei! Xiao Wei!

59
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,479
Xiao Wei.

60
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,240
Our table's over there.

61
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,280
Yes, here, here.

62
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:09,800
What kind of place is this?

63
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:10,960
I want a private room.

64
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:12,960
Xiao Wei.

65
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:14,240
We came too suddenly.

66
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:16,439
This place is hard to book.

67
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:18,839
And sausages...

68
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,519
...what would you like?

69
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,000
Xiao Wei.

70
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,240
Such a country bumpkin.

71
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,800
What does he know?

72
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,800
Just pretending to understand.

73
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,639
One salad...

74
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,959
...one borscht...

75
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:45,839
...Siberian dumplings...

76
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,040
...well-done steak.

77
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,759
Borscht and well-done steak.

78
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:58,279
Didn't know...

79
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,800
...you spoke Russian.

80
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,720
When you're out in the world...

81
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,079
...you pick up things.

82
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,800
Xiao Wei! Xiao Wei!

83
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,480
What?

84
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,120
See what you'd like to eat.

85
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:09,160
Everything.

86
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:12,160
Such an appetite today.

87
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,519
Shall we have some wine?

88
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,199
Yes, absolutely.

89
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:18,879
Not just wine - the most expensive.

90
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:20,879
No problem.

91
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,839
Understand?

92
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,519
Wait a moment.

93
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,279
Good chance to try their food.

94
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:30,079
Stop talking so much.

95
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:36,639
Xiao Wei, don't drink alone.

96
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:45,000
Xiao Wei.

97
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,319
I'll freshen up in the restroom.

98
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,839
Later, spill water on that woman.

99
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,160
Here.

100
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,160
Thanks.

101
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:32,279
Sorry, sorry.

102
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:33,079
I didn't mean to.

103
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,800
No problem. Where's the restroom?

104
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:35,399
This way.

105
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:39,800
Excuse me for a moment.

106
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,079
This way, I'll take you there.

107
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:56,839
Xiao Wei.

108
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:02,560
Boss.

109
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,160
That lady who was dining with you earlier...

110
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,040
wants to see you.

111
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,079
Where is she?

112
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:08,759
This way.

113
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,439
Okay.

114
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,600
You...

115
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:21,160
Xiao Wei, I'll go check.

116
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:23,079
What exactly were they doing?

117
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:24,360
Wait for me.

118
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:30,879
Officer Gu, you wanted me?

119
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:38,639
Come in, help me with something.

120
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:49,680
Officer Gu.

121
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:51,199
What is it?

122
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,519
The zipper won't close.

123
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,759
Come help me with it.

124
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:01,560
Stop drinking, Xiao Wei.

125
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:03,879
Let me tell you...

126
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:05,560
You wouldn't believe...

127
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,360
what I just saw.

128
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,279
What?

129
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,240
I saw Laifu and Officer Gu...

130
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,720
enter a room together.

131
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:17,399
Though I don't know what they were doing,

132
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:19,839
it couldn't have been anything good.

133
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,439
Are you serious?

134
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,079
Absolutely true.

135
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,160
Where are they now?

136
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,679
Done?

137
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:03,039
Done.

138
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,279
Right in this room.
