1
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:30,200
How fragrant

2
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:32,159
Which lovely lady's

3
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:47,799
My beauty

4
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:52,840
Where are you hiding

5
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,640
Come out now

6
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,480
Pretty one

7
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,560
Sweetheart

8
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:12,599
Come here

9
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,280
You...you're new here

10
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,960
What's your name

11
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,240
Come on

12
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,759
Dancers here often worship Fox Immortals

13
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,680
To make customers devoted

14
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,319
Recently a customer died here

15
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,879
Rumored to be killed by Fox Immortal

16
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,120
Tricked with spirit money turned to gold

17
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,240
Hanged himself

18
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,520
People spread supernatural tales

19
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:02,199
This Fox Immortal has six tails

20
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:03,759
You know quite a lot

21
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:04,919
The weirder the story spreads

22
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,280
The more suspicious it is

23
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,560
Impressive, fiancée

24
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:08,719
Of course

25
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,800
Our House of Bai is famous mystics

26
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,479
Like Huang Dataiye's case

27
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,519
Solved by my grandfather

28
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,439
So if you want to know

29
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:21,879
More about Huang Immortal

30
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,920
Help me solve this case first

31
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:46,680
Can I help you?

32
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:49,759
A woman in uniform

33
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,519
Has special charm

34
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,079
Excuse me, let me pass

35
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:55,879
Officer

36
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,079
Where are you rushing to?

37
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,160
How about a drink?

38
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,480
I'm working, show respect

39
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,560
And...

40
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,160
I wasn't finished

41
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,480
Don't be nervous

42
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,279
Just a drink

43
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:11,879
Let go

44
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,040
Just harmless drinking

45
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:17,879
You...jerk!

46
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:18,639
Excuse me

47
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,319
Jerk

48
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:39,680
Where'd you go?

49
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,959
You left mid-sentence

50
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,319
Nature calls

51
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,360
Hello, I'm Gu

52
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,720
Gu Mingli

53
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,240
Laifu

54
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,720
That was Colonel Yamamoto

55
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,839
Head of Kwantung Army in Harbin

56
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,600
You offended him for me

57
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:05,920
Thank you

58
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:08,959
No trouble

59
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,560
On our home turf

60
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,839
Can't let outsiders bully us

61
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,160
Right, Officer Gu?

62
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,040
Right

63
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,879
Let's be friends

64
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:20,519
Here

65
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:23,360
You...

66
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,040
What's your secret code?

67
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,360
Who are you?

68
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,040
Cops have too much free time

69
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:40,560
Since when are you friends?

70
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:41,959
Just met

71
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,160
Xiao Wei

72
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,720
It is you

73
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,759
Xiao Wei, you came here

74
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,839
Without inviting me

75
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:53,639
All sorts of people here

76
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,639
Very dangerous

77
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:55,720
I'll protect you

78
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,040
What protection?

79
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,639
My fiancé will protect me

80
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,519
Go cool off somewhere

81
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,279
Fiancé?

82
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:05,680
Excuse me, everyone

83
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:08,360
Fiancé

84
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:12,439
Xiao Wei, I know

85
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:15,920
You're teasing me

86
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:16,879
Right?

87
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,160
Why would I tease you?

88
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,279
Look

89
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:21,639
Let me properly introduce

90
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,079
This is my fiancé

91
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,560
Fiancé

92
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,839
Enough already

93
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:38,879
Xiao Wei

94
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:58,240
Graceful white fox, with nine majestic tails.

95
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,279
My noble house welcomes guests as kings.

96
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,319
Build homes and families, I bring prosperity.

97
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:04,639
Between heaven and earth, here we act.

98
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:07,000
Graceful white fox, with nine majestic tails.

99
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,279
My noble house welcomes guests as kings.

100
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:11,399
Build homes and families, I bring prosperity.

101
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,279
Between heaven and earth, here we act.

102
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,039
Good, good.

103
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:57,960
Next performance.

104
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:00,080
Please welcome our magician.

105
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:03,799
Good.

106
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:05,279
Good.

107
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,879
On this miraculous night,

108
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,919
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity awaits.

109
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:11,879
I wonder which friend

110
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,320
would join this extraordinary journey.

111
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,120
Me.

112
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:17,679
Me, me, me!

113
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,480
Me.

114
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:19,960
This lady, please come up.

115
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:23,960
Make way.

116
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:28,279
Miss, follow my cues.

117
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:29,559
After pulling the blade,

118
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:30,840
we'll complete this

119
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,200
impossible magic together.

120
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:33,440
Everyone, applause.

121
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,720
Go for it!

122
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:37,360
Good, good, good.

123
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:43,919
Is everyone ready?

124
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:45,879
Ready!

125
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,639
One.

126
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,000
Two.

127
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,639
Three.

128
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:15,840
Back off, behave!

129
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,559
Everyone step back!

130
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,080
Don't move!

131
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,720
Step back, retreat!

132
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:18,440
Step back, retreat!

133
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,240
Are you okay?

134
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:20,240
Get down!

135
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,480
I killed someone.

136
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:22,159
Get down!

137
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:22,919
Hands on your head!

138
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:25,960
Police investigation!

139
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,799
Until this is fully investigated,

140
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,759
no one leaves.

141
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:41,879
Officer Gu.

142
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:42,960
Move aside.

143
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:45,360
Move aside.

144
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:50,759
Now,

145
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,440
I, Gu Mingli, as this city's

146
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:53,799
highest clearance-rate officer,

147
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:55,120
suspect you of murder.

148
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:57,480
I...

149
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,240
I didn't kill anyone.

150
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,799
I'm not the killer.

151
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,200
Laifu.

152
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:04,639
I didn't kill anyone.

153
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,120
You believe me, right?

154
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,519
Laifu.

155
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:09,360
So many witnesses saw it happen.

156
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:10,679
Whether you're the killer

157
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:11,840
I'll investigate thoroughly.

158
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:15,039
Mr. Laifu,

159
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:17,000
please come with me

160
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,240
to assist the investigation.

161
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,559
Fine.

162
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,039
Let me go!

163
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,039
Let go! Behave!

164
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,679
What is this place? I won't go!

165
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,120
Let me out!

166
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:35,480
Listen carefully,

167
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:36,879
I'm the Bai family's young mistress.

168
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,399
I absolutely didn't kill that man.

169
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:40,279
I didn't know him - why would I kill him?

170
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:41,279
Laifu.

171
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,200
Laifu! Laifu!

172
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,960
You know I didn't kill him, right?

173
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,159
Help me! Get me out of here!

174
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:48,600
I can't stay here.

175
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,879
Help me quickly!

176
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,519
I can save you,

177
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:53,960
but give me the photo.

178
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:02,000
It's in my bag - take it yourself.

179
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,679
This photo is useless in your hands

180
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,000
Only I know the clue

181
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,440
If she keeps me locked up here

182
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:21,080
You'll never get the clue in your lifetime

183
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,519
What?

184
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:25,759
Stay put

185
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:27,879
Officer Gu

186
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:28,759
Why should I just stay put?

187
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,360
If Miss Bai wanted to kill someone

188
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,919
She wouldn't be foolish enough

189
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:33,879
To do it in front of everyone

190
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:34,559
Right

191
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,559
How about this

192
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,919
Give me a chance

193
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,399
I'll help investigate

194
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,360
I owe you one

195
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:47,960
Speak up

196
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,320
What's your plan?

197
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,399
First show me the corpse

198
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:58,159
