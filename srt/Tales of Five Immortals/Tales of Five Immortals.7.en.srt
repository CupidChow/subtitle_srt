1
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:12,840
Enter

2
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,280
Officer Gu

3
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:16,159
Think carefully

4
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:18,239
Come find me

5
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,680
Better than following Bai Xiaojie

6
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:27,560
Even those who shouldn't come are here

7
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:28,920
If I don't come

8
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,040
Who knows what schemes you'd plot

9
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:41,719
Bai Xiaojie

10
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:44,280
Are you so

11
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:46,359
Lacking in confidence?

12
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:55,519
Calm down

13
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:57,079
Let's get to business

14
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,920
We've found a lead

15
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,480
We need your help, Officer Gu

16
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,000
What did you find? Tell me

17
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,400
The cases of Hu and the magician

18
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:12,199
Share one crucial link

19
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,879
They're connected to one person

20
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,759
Ziyan

21
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:18,120
Ziyan

22
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,719
Ziyan

23
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,879
That dancer who died

24
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:32,719
I recall it was just suicide

25
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:34,240
Her case was ordinary

26
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,639
The scene was clean too

27
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,479
I must remind you

28
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,639
The three-day deadline approaches

29
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,360
If by tomorrow night

30
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:45,400
You haven't found the killer

31
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,240
I'll take her away

32
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,960
How many times must I say

33
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:51,319
I'm not the killer

34
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,039
If you cops can't solve it

35
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:54,199
Why blame us?

36
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:03,759
Are you lecturing me?

37
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,360
One day

38
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:07,879
Just one day

39
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,599
I still need to find someone

40
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:16,199
Have you seen this?

41
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,319
Thank you, sir

42
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,800
You're so wicked

43
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,639
Call

44
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,439
Raise

45
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,840
Qian Gongzi, I...

46
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,039
It's you

47
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:52,319
Who's this? You know him?

48
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:55,599
Would I know such lowlifes?

49
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:00,719
Not here for you

50
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,159
Qian Gongzi

51
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,919
Do you know Miss Ziyan?

52
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,360
Sister Ziyan, you're so lucky

53
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,719
Close your eyes, hold out your hand

54
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,879
I folded this myself

55
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:22,439
Do you like it?

56
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:24,399
I do

57
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:33,360
Wait, who are you?

58
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:35,920
Babbling nonsense here

59
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:39,680
With your meager coins

60
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,360
You can't even buy in

61
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,480
Stop pretending to be rich

62
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:44,279
Get lost

63
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,399
Who says he's broke?

64
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,040
My money is his money

65
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:53,480
This should cover the buy-in

66
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,800
Xiaowei

67
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,839
Qian Gongzi

68
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,360
Your aura shows death's shadow

69
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,439
Reeks of impending doom

70
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,079
Ziyan has marked you

71
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:10,319
What nonsense is this?

72
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,720
I speak the truth

73
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:14,879
Debts must be repaid

74
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,079
Ziyan died with grievances

75
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:20,360
Two have died already

76
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,759
You're next

77
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:35,120
If you're so powerful

78
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:37,600
Can predict spirits and gods

79
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:41,240
Then

80
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,399
What card am I holding?

81
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,720
Can you tell me that?

82
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,399
I lack such skills

83
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:55,519
Then admit you're a fraud

84
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,480
Crawl around the table

85
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,879
Bark like a dog

86
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,720
If it amuses me

87
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,279
I might let you go

88
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:03,879
Right, brother?

89
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,319
Ace of Spades

90
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:16,560
Ace of Spades!

91
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:20,040
Mine's Five of Diamonds

92
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:33,920
Well, do you believe me now?

93
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,279
Truly, heroes emerge from the young.

94
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,480
Let's make it official.

95
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:39,920
How about a game of dice?

96
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:44,480
Why waste time with him?

97
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,680
Brother Heng.

98
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,199
If I win, I want all your chips.

99
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:50,160
You win.

100
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:52,600
Let's hear how you can help me.

101
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:55,959
This young master Qian is quite calculating.

102
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,839
So according to you,

103
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,360
there's no benefit for us either way.

104
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,839
Let's go, we won't play with him.

105
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:02,920
What does his life or death matter to us?

106
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:05,199
So, do you want to bet or not?

107
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,199
I'll bet.

108
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,839
That Laifu seems to have some tricks up his sleeve.

109
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:22,600
I think he's pretending to be crazy.

110
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,079
The whole casino is under our control.

111
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,560
He can't play any tricks.

112
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:35,040
Young master Qian, young master Sun.

113
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,839
I want him to lose miserably.

114
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,560
Understood?

115
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:46,839
Understood.

116
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,000
You always use my money to play the hero.

117
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,360
Let me tell you something.

118
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,160
I'm keeping track of all the money you owe me.

119
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,560
Isn't the three-day deadline almost up?

120
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,759
I'm worried something might happen to you.

121
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:04,800
If something happens to you, my lead is gone.

122
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,240
Then coming to Harbin would be for nothing.

123
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,360
You...

124
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,399
Miss Bai.

125
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:13,639
Don't worry.

126
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:16,360
As long as you help me find the photo clue,

127
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:18,000
I'll pay you back all the money.

128
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,639
If I can't pay in one year, I'll take two.

129
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,120
If not in two, then three.

130
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,480
After all, I'm your fiancé.

131
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,680
I'll pay you back slowly.

132
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,759
You... always full of big talk.

133
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,519
Just play along with them casually.

134
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,279
At worst, I'll just bet you.

135
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,200
You wouldn't dare.

136
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,000
Don't worry, nothing will happen.

137
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:36,679
Let's go.

138
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:45,240
It's your first time at a casino.

139
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,279
I won't take advantage of you.

140
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,440
Let's play dice.

141
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:49,519
One each, higher number wins.

142
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:50,720
Fine.

143
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,600
Then let's not waste time.

144
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:53,720
One round only.

145
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,000
Come on.

146
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:25,639
Lucky, it's a tie.

147
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:26,679
Again.

148
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,919
This isn't getting us anywhere.

149
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,879
How about this.

150
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:52,919
Let's see who gets the lower number.

151
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,080
We said higher number wins.

152
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,600
How can you just change the rules?

153
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:58,720
What's wrong with changing?

154
00:09:59,200 --> 00:09:59,679
What?

155
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,519
Higher number can win,

156
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:02,679
but lower number can't?

157
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:29,559
Come on, gentlemen.

158
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:30,600
Your turn.

159
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,120
Are you scared?

160
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,360
Or can't you roll it?

161
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,399
With these loaded dice,

162
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,840
of course you can't roll a one.

163
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:58,120
Who would have thought the famous young master Sun

164
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:01,279
would resort to such dirty tricks.

165
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,240
If he wins, he wins.

166
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,320
It's not like I can't afford to lose this small amount.

167
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,480
I said I'm not playing for money.

168
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:12,840
Go ahead.

169
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,279
What do you want?

170
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,279
When it comes down to it,

171
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,840
she's just a wandering ghost.

172
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:19,600
When she was alive,

173
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:21,440
she was just a second-rate dancer.

174
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:23,519
Dreaming of marrying into our Qian family.

175
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,120
Good riddance she's dead.

176
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:26,360
You...

177
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:35,519
Tonight,

178
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,240
sleep in Ziyan's room for one night.

179
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,759
That's all.

180
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,039
Just that simple.

181
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:42,960
But,

182
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,080
no matter what happens,

183
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,240
don't open the door.

184
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:35,960
Is anyone there?

185
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,600
I'm thirsty.

186
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,639
No matter what happens,

187
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,480
don't open the door.

188
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,080
Going out for some water

189
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,639
shouldn't be a problem, right?

190
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:23,080
Namo Amituofo

191
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,080
Taishang Laojun

192
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,200
May Guanyin Bodhisattva bless us
