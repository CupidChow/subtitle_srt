1
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,319
I need to save them.

2
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:23,159
Miss, please accept my condolences.

3
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:25,439
Old Ge.

4
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:27,439
Go make some food.

5
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,760
Your mistress has been busy with funeral arrangements these days.

6
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,120
Okay.

7
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,319
And hasn't rested much.

8
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,400
Yes.

9
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,680
It looks like rain.

10
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:42,599
No.

11
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,560
I must hurry to the cemetery.

12
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,879
Or Grandpa and the others will get wet.

13
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,640
What's most important for you now

14
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,439
is to rest.

15
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:01,280
You need to learn to let go.

16
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,760
Move forward.

17
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:04,439
Move forward.

18
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:09,039
Grandpa and Laifu are both gone.

19
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,919
Where should I go?

20
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,120
Don't you want to find the killer

21
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,039
and avenge Laifu and Bai Ye?

22
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:19,400
How can I take revenge alone?

23
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,080
I can't even find their bodies.

24
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,879
Can only bury their clothes.

25
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:27,439
Officer Gu.

26
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:29,159
When will this case be solved?

27
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:31,560
I'll help you.

28
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,719
Catching criminals is my duty.

29
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:38,039
I'll come back at this time tomorrow.

30
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,879
Hope to see you in better spirits.

31
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,599
Together,

32
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,360
we'll give them justice.

33
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,439
Wait.

34
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,400
No need to wait until tomorrow.

35
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,439
Let's start now.

36
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,719
Take it over.

37
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:14,400
Hui Xin.

38
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,039
Tell me again,

39
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:20,120
what your boyfriend Zhang Hua

40
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,199
used to do for work.

41
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,400
He worked at the police station.

42
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,479
Handled household registration.

43
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:36,520
Did he interact with many people?

44
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:37,960
Not many.

45
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:40,000
He just managed files,

46
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,000
stayed in his office all day,

47
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,680
avoiding people.

48
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,439
Do you

49
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:55,120
have any new leads?

50
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,919
We all think

51
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:59,240
he impersonated Zhang Hua

52
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,560
for some special reason.

53
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,360
I...

54
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,159
We two

55
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,439
are from ordinary families.

56
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,080
He just had a basic salary,

57
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,399
dealt with files all day,

58
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,399
and had few friends.

59
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:24,079
Another dead end.

60
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:27,160
Hui Xin.

61
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,560
If there are new leads,

62
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:30,000
I'll contact you again.

63
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:31,639
Also,

64
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,759
the fake Zhang Hua has escaped.

65
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:35,399
During this time,

66
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,279
police will protect you.

67
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:38,399
Be careful yourself.

68
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,639
Old Wang.

69
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:41,360
Her safety is your responsibility.

70
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:41,920
Yes.

71
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:42,879
Come.

72
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,040
How about

73
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:59,480
we check Zhang Hua's office?

74
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,439
Rarely

75
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:04,319
do we think alike.

76
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:17,279
This is Zhang Hua's office.

77
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,319
This is where Zhang Hua

78
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,680
processed all household records.

79
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:37,920
Before Zhang Hua disappeared,

80
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,839
was there anything unusual?

81
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,959
His daily work

82
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,480
was mostly alone here.

83
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:44,639
We're not sure either.

84
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:06,360
Did you see it too?

85
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,959
What's drawn here?

86
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,560
And here.

87
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:33,040
Director.

88
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:34,959
Next to these names,

89
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:36,519
why these marks?

90
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:38,879
We didn't make these.

91
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,399
What's special about this family?

92
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:45,040
Why would Zhang Hua look for them?

93
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:48,199
Whatever's special about them,

94
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,160
this person

95
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:53,000
is planning something big.

96
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:56,800
What should we do next?

97
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,639
Start with the missing persons,

98
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,720
investigate one by one.

99
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,160
Our daughter's been missing half a year.

100
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,480
Found nothing.

101
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:23,480
What's the use of you coming here?

102
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,959
We're here this time

103
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,879
because we've found some new clues

104
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,680
So we'd like to ask you both

105
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:32,000
if you've missed any details

106
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:33,560
that could help our investigation

107
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:35,720
Nothing special

108
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:38,439
That day I came back from the fields

109
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,600
and my wife told me

110
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,399
our daughter was missing

111
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,439
I was cooking that day

112
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,519
She said she was going out briefly

113
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,519
and never came back

114
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,480
I've asked everyone around here

115
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,279
and reported to the police

116
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:57,319
Now we can only pray she's safe

117
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:58,759
That day

118
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,839
did your daughter act strangely?

119
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:05,720
No

120
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:07,720
Both of you

121
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,319
If that's the case

122
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:11,000
it's hard for us to help you

123
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,040
This was my grandfather's keepsake

124
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:27,680
I couldn't save him that day

125
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:31,680
Now I just want to catch the killer

126
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,759
Xiaohua's case and my grandfather's case

127
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,320
are the same

128
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,159
So her clues are

129
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:44,120
really extremely important to me

130
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,360
Uncle, I beg you

131
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:49,799
Please tell me, okay?

132
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm begging you

133
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,120
I'm begging you

134
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,679
Please tell me

135
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,960
No one believed me before

136
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,559
I believe you

137
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,519
That day was like any other

138
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,720
I came back from the fields at dusk

139
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:25,840
and felt something was wrong

140
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,639
After dinner at home

141
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,320
suddenly a strong wind rose outside

142
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:37,320
This road is usually crowded

143
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,240
But that day

144
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,840
there wasn't a soul

145
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:47,039
How strange

146
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:50,080
The street's empty today

147
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,159
Not a single person

148
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,399
Maybe everyone went home early

149
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,200
Good thing I came back early

150
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:56,960
or you'd keep worrying about me

151
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:58,039
Be good now

152
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,840
Mom, I've washed up

153
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,480
Okay

154
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:28,159
Strange

155
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:29,200
Who's there so late?

156
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:30,799
You said no one was outside

157
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,240
Here they come

158
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:34,080
There's really no one outside

159
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,480
Go open the door

160
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,080
Who is it?

161
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,720
It's not raining outside

162
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,360
Why is it all wet?

163
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:53,799
Thirsty

164
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:56,759
Alright, come in

165
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:57,919
I'll get you some water

166
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:09,759
Thirsty

167
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:13,519
Here, brother

168
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,559
Thirsty

169
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:32,919
Still thirsty

170
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,519
Thirsty

171
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:45,200
Sorry, brother

172
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:46,799
We're out of water

173
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,039
It's dark now

174
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,440
not convenient to fetch more

175
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,879
Maybe try another house

176
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:54,519
Thirsty

177
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:56,799
Dad, Mom

178
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,440
What's wrong with you?

179
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,480
When we woke up

180
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,840
our daughter was gone

181
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:10,360
Did you tell the police?

182
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,200
We did

183
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,600
No one believed us

184
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:16,279
Told us not to be superstitious

185
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:17,440
Even suspected

186
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:20,000
we killed our own daughter

187
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,679
and made up this story

188
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:26,000
They investigated for long

189
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,279
but found nothing

190
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,639
so it was dropped

191
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:34,639
Don't worry

192
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:38,000
I'll definitely find Xiaohua for you

193
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,080
Do you have a photo of Xiaohua?

194
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,759
No

195
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,000
Oh right

196
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,200
This is her zodiac year

197
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:52,879
We tied a red string on her wrist

198
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,679
Red string

199
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,200
Officer Gu

200
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,399
I was just near Fang Xiaohua's house

201
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,279
and found a small pier

202
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,399
Think about it

203
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,600
Late at night

204
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:14,000
He was all alone, soaking wet

205
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,159
carrying a girl in his arms

206
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:16,879
He must have wanted to escape

207
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,399
somewhere no one would see him

208
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,519
This pier must be crucial

209
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,279
Miss Bai

210
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,679
I let you join the investigation before

211
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,720
to help you overcome your grief

212
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,360
But now

213
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:34,240
I realize I might have been wrong

214
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,600
This case is extremely dangerous

215
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,120
You can't be involved anymore

216
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,879
Leave the rest

217
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:44,879
to me

218
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,759
Why?

219
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:48,919
Avenging Grandpa and Laifu

220
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
is my responsibility too

221
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:52,279
I've made my decision

222
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,200
All future operations will be kept from you

223
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,080
until we catch the real culprit

224
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:58,960
Xiao Li

225
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:02,240
Here

226
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:04,120
Gather all officers immediately

227
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:06,159
Full gear, let's move out

228
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,159
Sorry, Officer Gu

229
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:08,320
There's an order saying

230
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:09,679
you can't investigate this case

231
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,679
Who said that?

232
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,120
I did

233
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:18,480
Chief

234
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,840
A cop must use their own judgment

235
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:30,200
Can't just follow others blindly

236
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,840
You should take some rest

237
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:36,080
Leave other matters alone

238
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:42,240
This is my judgment

239
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:47,480
Gu Mingli

240
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:50,840
During your investigation

241
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:52,679
you abused power and leaked secrets

242
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,200
You're suspended effective now

243
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,480
Until this matter is fully investigated

244
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,960
you're not to leave this place
