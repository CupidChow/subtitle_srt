1
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,560
Don't go forward.

2
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,719
It's not safe ahead.

3
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,719
Haven't you been here before?

4
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:34,199
Don't go forward.

5
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,960
It's not safe ahead.

6
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:39,120
Auntie.

7
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,199
What did you just say?

8
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,520
Don't go forward.

9
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:47,199
It's not safe ahead.

10
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:02,199
Don't go forward.

11
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,000
It's not safe ahead.

12
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,240
This place again.

13
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:29,000
Don't go forward.

14
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:31,240
It's not safe ahead.

15
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,159
Don't go forward.

16
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,520
It's not safe ahead.

17
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,639
Who... who are you?

18
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,280
I am you.

19
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,400
Have fun.

20
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:05,240
Soon I'll replace you.

21
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,919
Where are you going?

22
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:10,960
Master.

23
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:14,639
Is anyone there?

24
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,360
Why is Grandpa taking so long this time?

25
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:22,439
Old Ge, has Grandpa returned?

26
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:23,240
Miss.

27
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:25,160
Bai Ye returned last night.

28
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,279
But he's been staying in his room.

29
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,759
Says he caught a chill.

30
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,560
Miss.

31
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,519
Bai Ye doesn't want to see anyone.

32
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,839
Says he'll be fine after sleeping.

33
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:36,879
Did Bai Ye say anything else?

34
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,040
Nothing.

35
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,360
Alright.

36
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,839
Go about your business, Old Ge.

37
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:58,560
Bai Ye, it's me.

38
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:00,480
I heard you're ill.

39
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,680
Xiaowei made your favorite porridge.

40
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,319
Would you like some while it's hot?

41
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:07,759
No need.

42
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,160
My chill is quite severe.

43
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,079
Don't want to infect you.

44
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:15,360
Not eating won't help.

45
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:16,680
How about this.

46
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:18,079
I'll leave it by the door.

47
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,240
Remember to take it later.

48
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,040
Laifu.

49
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:47,680
You.

50
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,480
What are you doing here?

51
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:50,839
Nothing.

52
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,240
I'm going to get medicine for Grandpa.

53
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:56,839
Come with me.

54
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:01,079
Grandpa can't stay like this.

55
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,120
Alright.

56
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:33,319
Bai Ye.

57
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,040
I left dinner by your door.

58
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,639
Xiaowei got you special

59
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:37,600
medicine for chills.

60
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,759
Remember to take it.

61
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,519
Bai Ye.

62
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:36,600
Are you feeling better?

63
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:38,319
A bit better.

64
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,079
Where are you going?

65
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:45,519
To cleanse myself.

66
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,639
You must be feverish.

67
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,319
The toilet's over there.

68
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,519
Perhaps

69
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:52,399
I'll take you.

70
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:55,560
No need, young master.

71
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:13,680
You dared to drug Grandpa?

72
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,560
Aren't you afraid he'll punish you?

73
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,040
Let me finish!

74
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,639
I put laxative in his food,

75
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:25,319
but antidote in his medicine.

76
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:26,879
He went at midnight,

77
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,639
so he ate but didn't take medicine.

78
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,319
Meaning?

79
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,519
He's faking illness.

80
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,559
Grandpa's too old

81
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,360
to fake illness. Why?

82
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,440
To hide something.

83
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,159
And he seems unfamiliar here.

84
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,519
Meaning?

85
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,000
I watched Bai Ye carefully.

86
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:52,279
I noticed he

87
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,399
eats and carries lanterns

88
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,159
with his right hand.

89
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,240
Grandpa's left-handed.

90
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,919
So he's hiding

91
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,039
to avoid contact with us.

92
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,159
To not get exposed.

93
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,159
You mean

94
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,159
my grandpa

95
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,120
isn't my grandpa?

96
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:15,000
We need to investigate.

97
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,200
How?

98
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:19,480
Did Bai Ye say where he went?

99
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,240
Grandpa mentioned

100
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:24,919
he was investigating a case.

101
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:38,799
Checked the database.

102
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,000
There's a case related to what you mentioned.

103
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:42,600
One month ago,

104
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:44,440
a girl named Hui Xin filed a report.

105
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,120
She said her boyfriend Zhang Hua

106
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,879
was completely different after his business trip.

107
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:50,840
She even claimed

108
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,720
the original Zhang Hua had died.

109
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,200
All information about this case

110
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:56,519
is here.

111
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,200
When we investigated,

112
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,799
some said Zhang Hua might've been possessed by an Ashen Shade.

113
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:04,799
But I think

114
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,440
that's complete nonsense.

115
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:10,919
Did she mention

116
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,679
how Zhang Hua was different?

117
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:15,320
Changed preferences,

118
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:17,320
altered memories,

119
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,799
and completely different daily routines.

120
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:23,399
Exactly like Bai Ye's condition.

121
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,679
You leave first.

122
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,679
I need to talk with Laifu.

123
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:30,879
That's my grandfather!

124
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,320
Why can't I listen?

125
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,279
It doesn't concern you.

126
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,279
Fine, I'm leaving.

127
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:56,320
Speak.

128
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,639
What do you want to say?

129
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,559
Previously,

130
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:08,200
that Tu Teng you asked me to investigate...

131
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,720
I have findings.

132
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:13,559
But the deeper I looked,

133
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:16,320
the more I realized at my level,

134
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:19,519
the information I can access is very limited.

135
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:23,080
What you're planning to do

136
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:25,919
could be very dangerous.

137
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,799
As a friend,

138
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:29,759
I advise against it.

139
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,039
I could hire you as a special consultant.

140
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,799
You'd be set for life.

141
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:38,279
Why must you

142
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,279
insist on involving yourself

143
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,919
in something potentially fatal?

144
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,799
Officer Gu,

145
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,919
everyone has their own destiny.

146
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,440
I have mine.

147
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,159
Bai Ye showed me kindness.

148
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:54,799
These Tu Teng

149
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,840
are connected to my family's death.

150
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,519
There's blood debt here.

151
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:05,039
Be it man, ghost or spirit,

152
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,080
debts will be repaid,

153
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:10,600
wrongs will be righted.

154
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,120
What exactly is the truth?
