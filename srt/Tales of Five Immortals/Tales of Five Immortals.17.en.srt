1
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:04,959
Master

2
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,079
Grandfather

3
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,680
You came so quickly

4
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:10,000
Truly impressive

5
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:12,640
Release that girl

6
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,959
What are you saying?

7
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,920
He's not Bai Ye at all

8
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,120
He's an impostor

9
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:29,079
You actually saw through me and Zhang Hua

10
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,640
I underestimated you

11
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:33,719
Laifu

12
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:37,799
Who are you really?

13
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:39,640
The real Zhang Hua

14
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:41,200
Where did you hide him?

15
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:45,439
Blame Zhang Hua

16
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:47,640
For knowing too much

17
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,879
I've already silenced him

18
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,439
If you'd just run a small business quietly

19
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,599
I could've ignored you

20
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,079
But you had to become a Master of Yin and Yang

21
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:02,159
And interfere to save this girl

22
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:03,319
Tell me

23
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:05,719
Can I let you go now?

24
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,120
So confident you can kill us?

25
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,919
Don't waste your effort

26
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:14,919
You can't escape

27
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:20,680
Let both of them go

28
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,919
I'll go with you

29
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,680
Was I unclear?

30
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:34,599
I said you'll all die

31
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,680
Only I know where Lao Bai Da is

32
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,199
You went through so much trouble

33
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:49,680
Just for what he's hiding?

34
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:52,439
Why not ask him directly?

35
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:55,879
You know where my grandfather is?

36
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,039
Boy

37
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:01,280
You should know

38
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:03,039
In this world

39
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,159
The smarter you are, the more you must choose sides

40
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,599
Choose wrong and you'll die

41
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,080
I know

42
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,360
So

43
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,479
Do you want Lao Bai Da

44
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,639
Or to kill us?

45
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:23,240
Your choice

46
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:33,120
Fine

47
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,719
I'll trust you once

48
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:39,319
Let's go

49
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:46,199
Hurry

50
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,919
Go!

51
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:57,960
After you

52
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,319
You first

53
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,399
Bai Ye

54
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:29,399
Bai Ye

55
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:31,600
After all this time

56
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,079
You're finally in my grasp

57
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,439
Bai Ye

58
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:55,720
Xiao Wei

59
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,399
Get in

60
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,120
Who are you really?

61
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,680
Stop lying to me

62
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,160
Xiao Wei

63
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:10,040
I'm your grandfather

64
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,879
I was ambushed

65
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,480
Barely escaped

66
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:16,839
Grandfather

67
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:18,519
But I was badly injured

68
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,759
Had to hide somewhere remote

69
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:22,800
Grandfather

70
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,879
They thought I died

71
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,319
Luckily Laifu found my clues

72
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,399
Grandfather, you...

73
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:32,639
Xiao Wei, run!

74
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:33,720
I'll save Laifu

75
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,600
Grandfather

76
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,360
Hurry, Grandfather

77
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,439
Master

78
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:40,360
Grandfather

79
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,319
Grandfather

80
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,839
Boy

81
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,399
I told you

82
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,800
Don't choose the wrong side

83
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,720
Or you'll die

84
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,800
Your father chose wrong

85
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:11,040
Got your whole family killed

86
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,800
I thought after all this time

87
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,000
I'd spare you

88
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,600
But now that's impossible

89
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:26,040
Who the hell are you?

90
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,439
Bai Ye clearly said it was The Immortal Huang Xian's doing.

91
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:30,279
That's what he told you?

92
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,959
He really cares about you.

93
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:37,959
Actually,

94
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:40,399
I killed them all.

95
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,199
Your father, your mother.

96
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,480
Come on!

97
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:45,759
Come get your revenge!

98
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,160
Open the door!

99
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:51,160
Kill me!

100
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,120
If it was really you,

101
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:55,199
why would Bai Ye lie to me?

102
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,000
Didn't want you seeking revenge.

103
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,279
Your mother ran over to distract me.

104
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:01,680
While your father

105
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,720
was drawing his last breath.

106
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:05,519
Your mother truly...

107
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:08,959
Watched her husband die by my hand,

108
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,360
yet for her son's sake,

109
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,120
came to distract me.

110
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:15,279
I was completely bloodlusted then.

111
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:16,639
Never realized

112
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:19,759
she was protecting you.

113
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,240
She screamed desperately, nonstop.

114
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,720
I could only draw my blade.

115
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,439
Again and again,

116
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,519
stabbing into her body repeatedly.

117
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,040
Her screams only excited me more.

118
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,720
Stop it!

119
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,000
Stab after stab... shut up!

120
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:11,399
Father!

121
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,120
Father!

122
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:16,240
Father!

123
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,680
Father!

124
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:27,639
Mother!

125
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:28,720
Mother!

126
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:29,680
Let me go!

127
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:30,879
Let me go!

128
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,600
Stop!

129
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,679
Get away!

130
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,360
Mother!

131
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,000
Laifu!

132
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,600
Mother!

133
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,320
Laifu!

134
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:38,480
Mother!

135
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,200
Laifu!

136
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,039
You're not my mother!

137
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,240
Kid,

138
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,240
I'm starting to like you.

139
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,519
But I utterly despise you.

140
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:16,440
If you dare kill me,

141
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,720
you'll have three deaths on your hands.

142
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,399
What do you mean?

143
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:23,679
You didn't release them?

144
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,159
Where are they?

145
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,000
Take me there!

146
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:40,159
Bai Ye!

147
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,240
Why is he alone?

148
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:44,120
Let those two girls escape?

149
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:45,960
Useless fool!

150
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,120
Release Bai Ye!

151
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,440
If you kill me,

152
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,840
he'll kill Lao Bai Da.

153
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:53,720
A life for a life.

154
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:55,519
I lose nothing either way.

155
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,159
Young master!

156
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,080
An old man like me

157
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,879
will die sooner or later.

158
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:02,399
Don't mind me!

159
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:03,159
Do it!

160
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:06,480
Fine!

161
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,080
You people...

162
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,440
How should I put this?

163
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,679
Good people are too soft-hearted.

164
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,320
You're just being unreasonable.

165
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,000
Stop this nonsense!

166
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:28,720
Very well!

167
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,559
Then kill us!

168
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,080
But you'll never get what you want.

169
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:35,840
How would you know?

170
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,960
If you'd found it,

171
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,320
you'd have killed us already.

172
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,000
Why waste time talking?

173
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,240
See, Bai Ye?

174
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:51,519
The younger generation impresses.

175
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:54,720
Zhou Zhong's son was never weak.

176
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,000
Young master!

177
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,799
Don't blame me for hiding it.

178
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,879
At this point,

179
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,879
you should know the truth.

180
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,200
He was your father's apprentice.

181
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,480
But this bastard

182
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:12,639
only wanted to profit from your father's teachings.

183
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:16,000
Their conflict grew deeper,

184
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,159
until one day...

185
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:19,159
Master!

186
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:25,360
Kneel down.

187
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,480
I said kneel down.

188
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,600
What I taught you

189
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,440
wasn't for trickery,

190
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:36,720
but to help people.

191
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,200
Not to swindle money like this.

192
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,919
I swindle?

193
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:46,480
I swindle?

194
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:50,000
And you?

195
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:52,600
Aren't you tricking people too?

196
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:54,960
Kneel down!

197
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,080
I won't.

198
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,120
I call you "Master"

199
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,519
out of respect.

200
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:03,120
Don't think I fear you.

201
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,960
Give me the book, I'll spare you.

202
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,919
Never.

203
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:09,759
From now on,

204
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:10,919
you're no longer my disciple.

205
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:11,840
Get out!

206
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,879
As long as I live,

207
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,600
I'll expose your tricks.

208
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:18,639
Zhou,

209
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,200
you're ruining livelihoods.

210
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:22,360
Heaven will strike you!

211
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,799
Think carefully.

212
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:28,399
Get out!

213
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:58,399
This outcome today

214
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,559
is your own doing.

215
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:03,000
I gave you chances.

216
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:05,480
I asked you to join me.

217
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,159
You refused.

218
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,840
Called my earnings dirty.

219
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:11,799
What about the rich?

220
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,399
Is their money clean?

221
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,960
You could've just walked away,

222
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:24,519
why destroy me completely?

223
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:26,600
Why?

224
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,559
Today I'll make everyone see

225
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,240
your Zhou family's true colors.

226
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,879
Kill me if you must,

227
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:42,279
but spare my family.

228
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,720
Oh no,

229
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm too kind

230
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,120
to not reunite

231
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,720
your whole family underground.

232
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,480
Master...
