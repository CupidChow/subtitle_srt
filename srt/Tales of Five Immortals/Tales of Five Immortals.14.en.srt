1
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:06,959
Mr. Chang

2
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:10,400
I heard the Serpent Immortal can revive the dead

3
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,400
and regenerate flesh from bones

4
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:14,920
Even Gao Shan's son was resurrected

5
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,640
I'm willing to give everything I have

6
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,760
just beg the Serpent Immortal to help me

7
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:23,879
Don't worry

8
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:26,000
The problem you're worried about

9
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:29,120
will definitely be resolved

10
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:41,040
This is how the Serpent Immortal heals

11
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,159
Stop worshipping

12
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:15,039
Who's this? Who is he?

13
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,159
Young man, impressive

14
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:21,080
One dose and he can stand

15
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,520
Truly a miraculous cure

16
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:29,280
You're utterly shameless

17
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:31,039
You're too audacious

18
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:32,960
Spreading superstitious nonsense

19
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:36,120
Openly cheating people of their money

20
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:38,800
Openly cheating people of their money

21
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,479
Not so

22
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,439
I serve the Serpent Immortal to relieve suffering

23
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,439
and bring peace to all

24
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:47,439
The Serpent Immortal appeared in my dreams

25
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:49,360
I'm just carrying out divine will

26
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:51,439
to dispel calamities

27
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:53,039
People believe in me

28
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,759
because sincere hearts bring blessings

29
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:57,439
Bullshit

30
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:01,439
You're just profiting in the Serpent Immortal's name

31
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,919
Don't speak nonsense

32
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,840
This immortal has saved many

33
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,120
We saw it with our own eyes, it's true

34
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:06,599
Exactly

35
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:07,759
We all witnessed it personally

36
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,360
That's right

37
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:09,479
Yes, absolutely

38
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:10,319
I saw it myself

39
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:12,280
Throw this reckless man out

40
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,439
No violence please

41
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:17,520
This man doesn't believe in the Serpent Immortal

42
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:19,319
That's just his ignorance

43
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:20,639
That's because

44
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,360
he hasn't seen the Serpent Immortal's power

45
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:25,319
Yes, right

46
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:25,840
Exactly

47
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:28,080
You won't stop until you see the coffin

48
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,400
If I told you

49
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,560
what you can do, I can do too

50
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,879
would that make me the Serpent Immortal incarnate?

51
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:41,319
People say snakes fear fire

52
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,039
That's because they've never seen

53
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:44,240
true serpent control

54
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,120
Today I'll make snakes pass through fire

55
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,599
Can you do that?

56
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,919
What's so hard about that?

57
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:55,319
Fine

58
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:05,520
Dark winds rise, plants tremble

59
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:08,719
Mystic snakes obey, appear now

60
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,840
With blood as guide, soul as offering

61
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,479
Bind your spirit, obey my command

62
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,240
Now summoned, come forth swiftly

63
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:29,560
Real snakes!

64
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,360
May you obey me, follow heaven's will

65
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,120
You are good spirits, follow the righteous path

66
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:41,279
Stop

67
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,439
What's happening?

68
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,800
The snakes won't obey Master Wei

69
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:47,079
but obey him instead

70
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:49,879
Has the Serpent Immortal possessed him?

71
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:53,279
Everyone calm down

72
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,720
This sorcerer must be using dark magic

73
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:57,879
Today I'll summon the Serpent Immortal

74
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:59,120
to vanquish you, sorcerer

75
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:04,519
Dark winds rise, plants tremble

76
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:06,040
Mystic snakes obey

77
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:07,480
appear now

78
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:15,639
Snakes! Snakes!

79
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:16,680
Go

80
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:17,920
Go

81
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:21,680
You may not value your life

82
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:23,639
but what about those two women's lives?

83
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:26,000
Who's not valuing life?

84
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,480
Who's this? What's going on?

85
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,399
Weren't you drugged by me?

86
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,920
Are you two ready?

87
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,240
So white

88
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,319
Might as well let me have some fun first

89
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:09,120
And you

90
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,639
Master

91
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,279
What is it?

92
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,040
The ritual is about to begin

93
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,319
Alright, I know

94
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:34,800
Damn old man

95
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,199
Disgusting

96
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:39,920
Looks like Laifu has started acting

97
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,639
The police are on their way

98
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:46,879
I'll go meet them

99
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,800
The rest

100
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:50,600
leave to Laifu

101
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:57,519
I

102
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,920
I testify

103
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:01,319
Master Wei is a fraud

104
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,920
He made me fetch snakes from the docks

105
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,560
And forced me to fabricate stories

106
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,639
To trick people into serving him and giving money

107
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,399
If I refused

108
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:13,120
He threatened to kill me

109
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:15,240
He's ruthless

110
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,160
I had no choice

111
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:18,959
Damn you, Chang'an!

112
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:21,360
After all I've done for you

113
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,279
You forced my hand!

114
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:27,160
See these snake scales on my neck?

115
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,120
Proof he poisoned me

116
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,959
When Dawu's father realized the scam

117
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,399
And tried to expose him

118
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,839
Master Wei made me poison him

119
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:36,639
To fake his suicide

120
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:39,120
All these deceptions

121
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,720
Were his doing alone

122
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,720
I'm innocent!

123
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,680
We were fooled by this fraud

124
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,279
We were blind

125
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,199
Please save my son!

126
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:48,959
Exactly!

127
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,199
You're the true master!

128
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,079
Please save my mother!

129
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:53,240
I beg you!

130
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:54,959
Listen everyone

131
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:01,160
Look here

132
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:04,600
This secret drug was found on Master Wei

133
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,839
Containing realgar snakes fear

134
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,360
And other herbs

135
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,879
Carry this with you

136
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:13,319
And you can control

137
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:15,120
The snakes' movements

138
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:16,839
You worshiped him

139
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,240
Believing gods would descend

140
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,560
To save your families

141
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,920
But instead

142
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,079
No gods came

143
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:25,879
Only his greed appeared

144
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,920
Now the truth is revealed

145
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:30,920
Take your families to real doctors

146
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,600
The hospital said my son's incurable

147
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,600
I wouldn't be here begging

148
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,600
If I had other options

149
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,759
You're condemning us to die!

150
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:43,759
Indeed

151
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,679
You don't understand

152
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,159
We gave all our money

153
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,159
To that fake Master Wei

154
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,399
Now we can't afford treatment

155
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:53,000
Please help us!

156
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,799
We beg you!

157
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,559
Everyone listen

158
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,759
Help us please!

159
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,759
Master Wei's stolen wealth

160
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:59,320
Is hidden in his backroom

161
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,480
Officer Gu will return it

162
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:02,919
Moreover

163
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:05,720
For any future troubles

164
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,000
Come to Bai Manor

165
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:10,559
I'll help however I can

166
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,879
Thank you!

167
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:13,440
Thanks

168
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:14,279
Thank you

169
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,320
I'm innocent too

170
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,159
I'm also a victim

171
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,159
I've told everything

172
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:20,840
Move!

173
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,519
I was deceived too

174
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,039
I never expected

175
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,159
You'd expose Master Wei's fraud

176
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,519
And help these people

177
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:36,360
I'm impressed

178
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,840
In this world

179
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:39,279
Everyone has desires

180
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,399
Some crave wealth

181
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,399
Others long for family

182
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,639
We're all human

183
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:48,720
Hard to stay clear-headed

184
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,600
What do you crave?

185
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,320
The truth

186
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:00,279
Wait!

187
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:02,879
Officer Gu!

188
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:16,279
Talk!

189
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:17,799
What's this?

190
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,200
History favors the victors

191
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,799
Would my words matter now?

192
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:24,720
Just kill me

193
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:27,320
What's this tattoo mean?

194
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,000
Who do you work for?

195
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,159
I'm just a pawn

196
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,360
You can't beat him

197
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:37,360
Go!

198
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,440
This is the totem you asked me to investigate

199
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:52,879
Don't worry

200
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:55,480
I'll inform you immediately if I find any clues

201
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,399
Thanks

202
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,360
This damn rain is so annoying

203
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,919
Couldn't even bring an umbrella to meet me

204
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,320
Your grandfather told me

205
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:16,000
my parents died because of the Yellow Immortal

206
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,279
But I clearly saw

207
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,799
the pattern on Master Wei's arm

208
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,120
is identical to my parents' murderer's

209
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,639
This symbol

210
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,559
also appears in the Yellow Immortal temple

211
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,679
and in the nightclub

212
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:30,159
and at Changling Hall too

213
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,799
I think

214
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,480
your grandfather is lying

215
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:34,240
Nonsense

216
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,159
My grandfather would never lie

217
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,759
If you don't believe me, go ask him yourself later
