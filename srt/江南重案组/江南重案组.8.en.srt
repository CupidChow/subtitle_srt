00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:29,070
Stand here.

00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:34,159
Phones, here.

4
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:39,372
[escort] What are you doing?

5
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:42,167
You're good.

6
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,501
[thug] Follow me.

7
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:45,587
[thug 2] Go ahead.

8
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:51,551
And your purse.

9
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:55,180
What's wrong?

10
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:00,643
Is this not allowed?

11
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:03,229
'Cause I won't survive
five minutes without this.

12
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:04,439
[K] Hey…

13
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,233
That will rot your teeth out.

14
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:09,527
Be careful, yeah?

15
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:10,612
Let her in.

16
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:12,697
Let's go, let's go. This will be fun.

-[escort] Is this really a party room?
-[escort 2] What?

18
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:17,243
-What is this place?
-What's this? There's nothing here.

00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,105
How's Gilho?

21
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:48,441
Um, well, he's out like a light.
Should we, uh,

22
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:51,069
take care of him when we're ready?

23
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:52,153
Hey…

24
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,199
I don't want anybody to touch Gilho.

25
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:59,536
Remember that he belongs to me.
Just keep an eye on him.

26
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:00,662
Yes, sir.

27
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,749
Hey, let's move him for now.

28
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,000
All right.

29
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,510
-The fuck? Did he escape?
-Shit.

34
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,107
God, you fucking idiots.

35
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:32,318
It was for all our sakes, Prosecutor.

36
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:35,738
You said you wanted to be
part of the entire plan.

37
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,282
[♪ opera music playing]

38
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,123
I told you.

39
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:48,585
No matter what,
you'll always be my underling.

40
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:51,754
Good to see you again.

[chuckles]

42
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,431
All right. Let's get started.

43
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,641
-Here we go.
-Prosecutor Min?

44
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:16,321
It's a foolproof contract, reviewed
by an attorney and a working prosecutor.

45
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:21,576
Yeah. [clicks tongue]

46
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,661
Seriously, what is this place?

47
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:28,875
[Lee] You did work out the side effects
of the meds, though, right?

48
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,294
I mean, not that I don't trust you.

49
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:36,966
Well, why don't you see for yourself?

-Huh?
-What?

52
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:55,401
Next month we're releasing
Leon and Leon Plus.

53
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:59,822
They will turn the market
completely upside down.

54
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,533
-[device beeps]
-Begin.

55
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:14,128
That one syringe
contains ten doses of Leon.

56
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:18,675
These girls haven't developed, uh,
any tolerance yet,

57
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,053
so you'll get to see
the full effect of Leon.

58
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:23,721
Watch.

59
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:28,726
No, I don't want to!

65
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:46,744
You're injecting an entire syringe
into her?

66
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,163
Isn't that lethal?

67
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:53,126
[Daesik] We are sure
this will work, right?

68
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:56,004
That's why we made the Leon Plus.

00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,862

You're the only one I believe in.

Shit! That shit is happening again!

I thought you told all of us these side
effects weren't going to happen again!

115
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,211
Reactions depend on the individual,

116
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,046
just like all drugs.

117
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,465

119

You keep complaining.

Just watch the rest of the trial.

[Gyungsoon stuttering]
He's right… [chuckles]

124
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:05,253
These types of trials are considered
successful if you do any better than 50%.

Why don't we finish
the contract signing first?

135

Once the products are released
across the country next month,

136
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:40,329
everyone here will make enough money
to retire like kings and queens, right?

137
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,582
And that was the point
of this whole project.

I'm at some kind of… [breathing heavily]
…drug company.

145
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,159
Wait a minute. You're here?

146

[Gilho] <i>"Here"? Where are you now?</i>

147
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:26,250
Hey, listen. Choi Hakgu tested the meds
on the girls.

148
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:30,338

Now, please, go ahead and sign,

in an official capacity.

Ah, fuck me. Is this some kind of joke?

00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:49,250
Shit. [clicks tongue]

166
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:54,004
Why is it 51 for you
and 49 for the rest of us combined?

167
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,593
I told you that you would only get
the goddamn permits

168
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,679
if you split it nicely, didn't I?

by diving into this crazy,
fucked-up business,

173
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:15,109
so shouldn't we be getting,
oh, I don't know,

174
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:17,695
more than chump change in return?

175
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:18,863
Don't you think?

176
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:22,992
Why, hello, Detective.

177
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,370
You must be here to save your daughter.

178
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,038
Yeseo. Where is she?

179
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,292
Why don't you just go?

I'm sure the title "whistle-blower"

475
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:04,198
especially in this scenario.

476
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:07,118
When exactly
did you begin this lonely battle?

477
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:09,537
A year ago,

478
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:12,999
I was approached
by former-Chief Prosecutor, Tak Juil.

479
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:16,419
He ordered me to frame and prosecute
an innocent man

480
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:17,962
in the Gangnam missing persons' case.

481
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:19,255
At the time,

482
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:21,966
I was seduced by the…

483
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,552
the idea of a promotion,

484
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:26,137
so I acquiesced.

485
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:29,223
It wasn't long before I figured out
that a criminal organization

486
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,434
was involved in the case.

487
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:36,105
A criminal organization allied
with a cartel of politicians.

488
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,691
Powerful politicians.

489
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:40,651
As a low-level prosecutor,

490
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:45,906
I-I realized that I had no chance
of taking them down myself.

491
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,660
As a prosecutor for the Republic of Korea,

492
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:54,457
I admit I permitted myself
to be a bystander and an accomplice

493
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,125
to their heinous crimes…

494
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:01,297

but it turned out to be nothing.

499
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,981
