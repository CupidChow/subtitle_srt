00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,563
[Mr. Choi] <i>There will be a crucial</i>
<i>business meeting in a few days.</i>

2
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:25,483
I remember you said
you'd give me a set of wings.

3
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:33,324
I want this partnership
to benefit both of us.

4
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:38,079
Let me be more than a puzzle piece.

5
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:40,582
Include me as part of the entire plan.

6
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:44,836
Staying a puzzle piece may be easier.

7
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,255
Why don't we go ahead and admit

8
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:49,591
that I've already spilled blood
for your sake.

9
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:52,260

12
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:02,854
Hello, Ms. Ryu.

13
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:03,938
Are you available to talk?

14
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:07,734
Of course, Prosecutor.
How may I assist you?

15
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:10,695
I have a ton of things
to take care of right now.

16
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:12,322
May I ask you for a favor?

17
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:15,325
Of course, I'm happy to help.

18
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,619
What can I do for you?

19
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:22,749
I'll get back to you soon, bye. Thanks.

20
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,380
You could've asked me for a favor.

21
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:32,008
This is about Mr. Choi, isn't it, Ms. Min?

22
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:35,220
Detective Jang, you already
have your hands full, don't you?

23
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,138
It's okay. I'll be fine.

[both grunting, groaning]

28
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:43,163
Hey, Minseok.

29
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,669
Are you hanging out with the cops, now?

30
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:53,882
Did you not miss me?

31
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:58,511
Not a day goes by without me
thinking about you.

32
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,847
Yeah. Remember this?

-Oh!

00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:19,449
You fucking ungrateful bastard.

39
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,368
Hey. If you've got a death wish,
just fucking tell me.

40
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,789
I fed you,
kept a fucking roof over your head,

41
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,708
and this is how you repay me, fucker?

42
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:29,959
[screams]

43
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,339
You fucking bastard!

[screams]

45
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,135
[K] We've got unfinished business
to settle.

46
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,679
I hear you've been looking for me, Gilho.

47
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,725
[sirens wailing]

48
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,854
We should go.
We've got the stuff in the car.

49
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:51,773
Let's go.

50
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,988
[thug] Think we should follow them?

51
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,198
Let them go.

52
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,700
We'll cross paths again real soon.

53
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:10,750
[groans]

54
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,256
Those bastards took my daughter Yeseo.

55
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,091
Where did they go? [coughs]

56
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:19,759
What are you talking about?

57
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:23,429
Yeseo… Yeseo is in your world now
trying to take revenge for Jaehee!

58
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,556
[panting]

59
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,641
Oh.

60
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:30,937
And so?

61
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:33,982
How does it feel?

62
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:39,404
Now that your daughter is gone,
it's personal, isn't it?

63
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,656
What?

64
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:49,831
Now you'll understand what it feels like
to lose someone you care about.

65
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,542
[groans]

66
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:56,587

[line ringing]

68
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:14,522
I'm sorry.

69
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,150
I could've taken care of it,

70
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,820
but it didn't go as planned because
Yoon Gilho showed up all of a sudden.

71
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:23,865
Those little rats
are annoyingly persistent.

72
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,870
Let's move up the timetable.

73
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,873
The trial period is almost over.

74
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:33,166
Yes, sir.

75
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,667
We'll get it done.

76
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,002
Get rid of both of them.

77
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:38,588
Don't leave a single trace.

78
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:39,672
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

79
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:52,643
You know where Choi Suin is, don't you?
Huh?

80
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,690
[phone ringing]

81
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,402
MINHEE

82
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,782
Hey, are you up? How do you feel?

83
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,867
[Dongwoo, panting] <i>It's me, the chauffeur.</i>

84
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,036
Where did you take my daughter, Yeseo?

85
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,998
I don't know what you're talking about.

86
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:16,918
Please do me a favor.

87
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,419
Please let Yeseo go.

88
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,588
That place is dangerous.

89
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:25,885
All the girls here came
of their own accord, all right?

90
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,804
<i>Didn't you see it earlier?</i>

91
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:31,057
<i>She ignored you when you were</i>
<i>desperately crying out for her.</i>

92
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,143
Then tell me why.
Why do you secretly help these girls?

93
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,895
You're worried about them too, right?

94
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,315
It's none of your fucking business,
you asshole.

95
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,736
[groans]

96
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,824
Why are you mean to Suin?
What'd she do to you?

97
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:50,576
She's just doing whatever that guy K says.

98
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,037
-Ow!
-K?

99
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,414
What the hell? Let go.

100
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,207
Where the hell is that one-eyed bastard?

101
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,917
-I don't know, okay?
-Tell me now!

102
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,587
[sighs, chuckles]

103
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,589
[Dongwoo] <i>You've heard</i>
<i>of Gangnam Trading Co., right?</i>

104
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:04,674
[Minhee] No, I haven't, I--

105
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,676
Tell me everything you know
about Gangnam Trading Co.!

106
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,010
Fuck's sake! That hurts!

107
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:17,937
[Dongwoo groans]

108
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,542
[Minhee] I guess maybe
I've seen him before.

109
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,169
The one-eyed bastard.

110
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:47,592
[K] I'm giving you plenty of this,
so share it with your friends.

111
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:49,594
Okay?

112
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:52,722
-Where did you see him?
-I mean, I can't remember that much.

113
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,348
I was high when I followed him there.

114
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:55,433
Was it a club?

115
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:58,478
Maybe. I think so?

116
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:01,439
But I think it was empty and quiet there.

117
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:15,036
[sighs] Of course they wouldn't
leave that place alone. Bastards.

118
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:20,208
-Ta-da. Isn't it pretty?
-[escort 1] Wow. I love that!

119
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,043
[escort 2] I know, I think it's so cute.

120
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,256
-We could be twinsies.
-[escort 3] Where? I want one too.

121
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:31,135
[escorts chattering, giggling]

122
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:41,229
Why did you log into Jaehee's account?

123
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:44,315
I wanted to get in touch
with the people Jaehee knew

124
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,651
so that I could make some money like her.

125
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:47,693
[Suin] Jesus.

126
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:52,198
Cut the bullshit and go home

127
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:54,534
while you still have
someone who cares about you.

128
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,078
That man who showed up?

129
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:59,038
That's your father, right?

130
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,832
I heard he's a cop.

131
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,962
You know he's become a chauffeur
in this business just to track you down.

132
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:12,134
Forget about him and just find us a party.

133
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:15,513
Get us the most elite
VIP clientele possible.

134
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,101
Hey.

135
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,315

Hey.

Don't you know you and I
want the same thing?

144
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:32,983
We want to get K and that old fuck
who runs Gangnam Trading.

355
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:20,990
[ringing continues]

356
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:27,664
Oh, my God.

357
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,917
Are you okay? What happened?

358
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,669
-Huh? Come on, Suin.
-[Suin coughs]

359
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,633
[Dongwoo] Those motherfuckers.

360
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:42,679
Bear…

361
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:45,223
-What?
-Jaehee…

362
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:46,683
What did you say?

363
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:49,686
The video… [gasps]

364
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:08,204
[breathes heavily]

365
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:22,093
[Yeseo] <i>If I don't make it through this…</i>

366
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:26,473
please give this to my dad.

367
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,559
Give it to him yourself, Yeseo.

368
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:31,144
Please, Suin.

369
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:33,938
And tell him that I'm sorry.

370
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,612
MY HEART

371
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:42,781
[Junghwa] <i>Hey, what if we get caught?</i>

372
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:43,907
[Jaehee] <i>Just let me.</i>

373
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,533
<i>It's so fucking strange.</i>

374
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,368
<i>To bring us to a place like this.</i>

375
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,913
[Daesik] <i>The trials</i>
<i>are going all right, yeah?</i>

376
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:52,582
I saw on the news they're saying
these missing persons' cases

377
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:53,958
in Gangnam are all linked.

378
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,336
You don't think we should be worried,
do you?

379
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:59,380
After all the money spent on it,
it'd better be successful. [laughs]

380
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,508
The subjects signed the waiver
acknowledging the risks

381
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:02,759
to their well-being.

382
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:04,886
I mean, we're actually helping

383
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:07,680
all those good-for-nothing people
be more useful.

384
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:08,890
-Right?
-[laughs]

385
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:12,811
There shouldn't even be any issues
for us to worry about.

386
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:14,354
That's why you're here now.

387
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:18,566
By the way, do the detox meds
actually work?

388
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,109
I still have my doubts.

389
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,947
If you can't trust me,
why don't you try it yourself?

390
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:27,116
The urine test will be completely clean.

391
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,250
[clears throat] All right, then.
Let's give it a try.

392
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:38,753
-Hey, you. Come here.
-[giggles] What?

393
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,714
Oh, no, I… What are you…
No, I'm good, yeah…

394
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:44,050
-Oh. You're good?
-[escort] Yeah, I'm good. No,

395
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:45,510
-I don't want to.
-Damn it.

396
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:48,179
You're paid for this, bitch.
Now shut up and get to work.

397
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:50,223
-[screaming]
-It may sting a little.

398
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:52,725
-Do what you're paid to do.
-Don't worry about it, baby.

399
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:56,104
-Time to work. There you go. Okay.
-[escort breathes heavily]

400
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:59,732
-[Daesik] Huh?
-[laughs]

401
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:02,026
[Lee] You like that, don't you?

402
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:05,029
[Daesik] There, there.

403
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,323
All right, all right.

404
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:09,367
-Here we go. Okay?
-[Daesik] Okay.

405
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:10,910
[Daesik] Okay.

406
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,036
Hey, come here.

407
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,830
[Daesik] All right, all right…

408
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:16,666
-[Lee] There.
-[Daesik] Here it goes. There, there.

409
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:25,800
Captain Kang, where are you?
What happened to you?

410
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,051
I'm gonna send you a video.

411
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,596
Send it to forensics,
expedite the analysis.

412
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:30,847
Yeseo…

413
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:34,309
went to a VIP party hosted by
Gangnam Trading Co.

414
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:37,186
And those perverted fuckers
tested drugs on the girls there.

415
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,730
There might be a lead in the video.

416
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:41,733
They talk about some kind of trials
and inject each other.

417
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:44,569
Like, you mean, clinical trials?

418
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:46,613
What? You know something?

419
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:49,365
<i>Prosecutor Min's been strange lately.</i>

420
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:52,285
<i>So I asked Jangho to put a tail on her.</i>

421
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:54,621
<i>Hang on a second.</i>

422
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:56,998
What?

423
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:00,084
-I just sent you a photo.
-[phone buzzes]

424
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:12,639
<i>At the time, I wondered why she was</i>
<i>going to a biopharmaceutical company.</i>

425
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:14,724
<i>I couldn't make the connection,</i>
<i>but now it makes sense.</i>

You can come in.

430
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:47,507
Prosecutor Min gave me a heads-up already.

431
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,979
So, after Noh Joonseo's death,

432
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,983
Prosecutor Min told me
she was going to play the long game,

433
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:07,193
and asked if I would join her.

Hello, Ms. Ryu.

[Dongwoo] <i>It's me.</i>

443
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:39,726
Jaehee's video…

444
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,020
I have it.

<i>And I'll give it to you</i>
<i>if you promise me one thing.</i>

My daughter Yeseo is there.

<i>Please, could you just…</i>

449
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,457
<i>hold off until I get there?</i>

450
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:10,983
[official] Yes, I had hoped you could.

451
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:13,194
-Of course, I'd be happy to.
-Well, fantastic, then.

452
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:20,201
Oh, my. The most important person
is finally here. [laughs]

453
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,411
None of you have met her before, right?

454
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:26,874
This is Prosecutor Min Seojin
from the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

455
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,543
[group laughing]

456
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,003
Well, why don't we all greet each other?

457
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:33,422
-[board member] It's great to meet you.
-She seems respectable.

458
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:34,799
Ah, welcome.

459
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:53,609
[groans]

460
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:59,365
[group exclaims, chuckles]

461
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:02,034
-Hello, you're here.
-Hello, Mr. Choi.

462
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:05,997
-Mr. Choi, it's a pleasure.
-Assemblyman Kim.

463
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:08,833
-I've been looking forward to seeing this.
-Good to hear.

464
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:10,001
Today's the day.

465
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:11,294
It sure is.

466
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:13,588
Sir.

467
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:16,424
-Hello, Mayor Woo.
-Sir, good to see you.

468
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:19,260
Well, now that Mr. Choi has arrived,
let's have a drink! Yeah?

469
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:21,137
-Oh, let's do it!
-Yes.

470
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,930
-Cheers.
-Cheers!

471
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,266
-Uh, wait.
-[glasses clinking]

472
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:28,186
Someone's not here yet, hold on.

473
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:29,353
[door opens]

474
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:53,252
What's everybody looking at?

475
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,880
Am I not supposed to be here? Huh?

476
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:02,220
Secretary Tak. [laughs]

477
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:04,889
I saw the news,
so I assumed you couldn't make it.

478
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:06,891
Is the investigation over already?

479
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:10,019
Of course, it was over quickly.
It's all formality anyway.

480
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:11,103
[board member] Of course.

481
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:13,105
Isn't that true, Mayor Woo?

482
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:15,358
Oh, y-yes that's right, Secretary Tak.

483
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:18,819
[laughs, sighs]

484
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:20,947
What is this?

485
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:25,952
The seat of the Minister of Justice
will soon be vacant.

486
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:29,330
Upon his acquittal,
Secretary Tak will take up the position.

487
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:32,250
[Tak chuckles] Well.

488
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:37,004
So it was just a test?

489
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:42,426
It was for all our sakes, Prosecutor.

490
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:46,180
You said you wanted to be part
of the entire plan.

491
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:51,769
I told you.

492
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:55,731
No matter what,
you'll always be my underling.

493
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:58,776
Good to see you again.

494
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,695
[chuckles]

495
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:08,327
All right. Let's get started. [sighs]

496
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:19,630
It's a foolproof contract, reviewed
by an attorney and a working prosecutor.

497
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:25,177
You did work out the side effects
of the meds though, right?

498
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:27,430
Not that I don't trust you.

499
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:32,476
Well, why don't you
see for yourself, then?

500
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,562
[device beeps]

501
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:41,736
[groans]

502
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:50,077
[Min] <i>What are you planning to do?</i>

503
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,122
[Dongwoo] <i>I will save those who must live</i>

504
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,042
<i>and kill those who must die.</i>
