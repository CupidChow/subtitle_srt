1
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,318
I'M PROSECUTOR MIN SEOJIN
LET'S CUT A DEAL

2
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:31,156
NOH JOONSEO SET UP A TRAP
FOR YOU AT HYENA

3
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:47,464
JAEHEE LEFT THESE FOR JUNGHWA

4
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:48,882
I KNOW YOU DIDN'T KILL JUNGHWA

5
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:54,304
YOU HAVE TO LIVE
TO SAVE JAEHEE'S LIFE!

6
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:01,936
What's good?

7
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:05,315
Ready?

8
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,534
Thank you.

9
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:35,845
<i>Boss, the prosecutor lady just came in.</i>

10
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,305
Goddamn it.

11
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,433
On the way. Hold on.

12
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,770
Sir, you can go alone, right?

13
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:45,146
Careful on your way up.

14
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:47,190
Hey.

15
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:52,403
You got a light?

16
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:54,572
Yeah, dude.

17
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:59,410
Mr. Yoon, those things will kill you,
you know?

18
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:02,747
Go on up.

19
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,049
Okay. The stray is on the way.

20
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:21,933
Yoon Gilho? Where are you?

21
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,435
How am I supposed to trust you?

22
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:26,688
I don't even know you.

23
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,648
<i>I'm here with Kang Dongwoo.</i>

24
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,985
As in Captain Kang, the one who saved you.

25
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:33,027
<i>Have you forgotten?</i>

26
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:35,613
You can believe me or not.
That's up to you.

27
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,657
But if you go in there now,
it's over for you.

28
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,075
You'll never find Jaehee.

29
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,828
Hello? Yoon Gilho.

30
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:37,592
GANGNAM B-SIDE

31
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:58,738
Whoo!

32
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:35,692
Come on.

33
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,260
How about we take two steps back?

34
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:04,137
Let's all take two steps back
for your safety.

35
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:06,597
Please wait for a second before you enter.

36
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,266
Hurry, for the security check.

37
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,393
Fuck.

38
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:12,770
- All right, get out.
- Ah, shit.

39
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:15,690
You're early.

40
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:18,526
You made it sound like you weren't coming.

41
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,530
What the fuck are you up to?

42
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:24,032
A game.

43
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:26,075
Have you never heard of role playing?

44
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,328
God, I thought I was gonna choke to death.

45
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,662
When does this start, Mr. Seo?

46
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,290
Your acting's getting better
and better. You should be an actress.

47
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:34,125
Are you sure this sticker is removable?

48
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,376
It's gonna make me break out.

49
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,503
Ah, shut your mouth.
The money is good enough.

50
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:39,547
Kim Jaehee's not here, huh?

51
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,049
Who cares?

52
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,135
All that matters is
whether he believes this is her.

53
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:48,181
Hey, drink up and get back in there.

54
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,183
He's gonna be here in a bit.

55
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:52,101
Again?

56
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,853
Let's go. Get up.

57
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:56,647
- This is so annoying.
- I know. I know.

58
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,066
All right, I'm going.

59
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:00,026
I've got no reason to stay,

60
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:02,653
since neither Kim Jaehee
nor Yoon Gilho are here.

61
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,419
So where the hell
is that bastard, Yoon Gilho?

62
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:20,505
<i>"That bastard" is right here.</i>

63
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,006
What did you say?

64
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,675
Meet me at Lucky Arcade
at Jinyang Center in one hour.

65
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,136
Make sure you come alone,

66
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,056
or you will never see me again.

67
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:34,685
Wait, wait, go back.

68
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,104
Motherfucker!

69
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,148
Mr. Noh!

70
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,902
You should've brought Gilho in yourself,
you idiot.

71
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,113
Where'd that fucker go?

72
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:46,406
Is there surveillance footage?

73
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:49,992
I watched the footage, boss.
Seems like he got out by the back door.

74
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,453
Oh, for fuck's sake!

75
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:54,664
LUCKY ARCADE

76
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:54,664
LUCKY ARCADE

77
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,098
{\an8}NO MINORS ALLOWED

78
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,894
So what do you want to know?

79
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:21,691
Lee Junghwa was killed by Noh Joonseo,
wasn't she?

80
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:24,026
- Mm-hmm.
- Know why?

81
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,279
I don't know. No motive really.

82
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:27,780
She died during an event.

83
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:29,574
An event?

84
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:35,538
It's when VIPs call up some women
and do whatever they want to them.

85
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,749
Rape, drugs, violence…

86
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:42,253
If the girls die, the incineration team
comes in to take care of the corpse.

87
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:43,796
What do you mean incineration?

88
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,092
You really don't know anything?

89
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:52,847
Cleanup is handled
by an incineration team.

90
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,689
They round up boys
who don't have any legal identity,

91
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:04,275
runaways, orphans, North Korean refugees,

92
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,027
and make them do the job.

93
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:10,448
I took Junghwa's body
before they could dispose of her.

94
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,783
Then why did you leave the body
in the subway?

95
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,789
So the police would at least pretend
to start some kind of an investigation.

96
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:24,545
So Noh Joonseo isn't after you,
it's Jaehee he wants?

97
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:26,672
Yeah, I think so.

98
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:27,632
Why?

99
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:31,928
To get rid of Jaehee.

100
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,805
And get rid of what she has with her.

101
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:41,979
What does she have?

102
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,411
I don't have much. Here.

103
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:59,497
It's all the cash advance
from my credit cards.

104
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,624
- I'll pay you back.
- Yeah, whatever.

105
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,167
TRANSFER COMPLETE
3,000,000 WON

106
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:06,671
Have you heard any news about…
Noh Joonseo?

107
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:11,008
Well, I hear he is bragging
that he took over HYENA.

108
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:15,680
Apparently, he's going to open
the Colosseum to celebrate or whatever.

109
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,181
You've been to the Colosseum, right?

110
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:21,686
Looks like Jjooni is more generous
than that cheap-ass Lee Gangsu.

111
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:26,190
I heard that he said he'll triple
all the MDs' pay if it goes good.

112
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,358
Isn't that dope?

113
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,902
I guess celebrities play on that level.

114
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:32,530
Jinyoung, snap out of it.

115
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,283
He's the reason Junghwa's dead.

116
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,827
A dead slut's a dead slut.
But we gotta carry on.

117
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,995
Hey, Oh Jinyoung.

118
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:42,415
To be perfectly honest,
we lost everything 'cause of Junghwa.

119
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:45,334
Now our business shut down,
and Mr. Yoon's missing.

120
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,335
All 'cause of you guys.

121
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,546
You have no idea
what you're saying, bitch.

122
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:49,839
"Bitch"?

123
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,383
You should leave.

124
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:55,469
You'll only ruin me
if I get involved with you.

125
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,305
Jinyoung, Jinyoung.

126
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,098
Avoid the Colosseum if you can.

127
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,060
You're not smart enough
to survive that place.

128
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:06,522
Jaehee.

129
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,151
You've made a lot of money here,
so mind your own business.

130
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:11,402
Seriously.

131
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,572
I'll mind my own business
and become a real success.

132
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,449
Got it?

133
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,958
Goddamn it.

134
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,841
Noh Joonseo, you loser.

135
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:36,344
Why the hell did you kill a cop, huh?

136
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:40,264
Lee Gangsu never went that far, you know.

137
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:43,351
I took care of it, right?
Can you quit bitching about it?

138
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:47,521
I cleaned up everything so you wouldn't
have blood on your hands.

139
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:51,067
I did that because if I hadn't
we would've all been screwed.

140
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,361
Fuck you, goddamn it.

141
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:57,657
By the way, can you discipline your guys
a little, for God's sake?

142
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,742
Deal with the Prosecutor Min at least,

143
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,786
and that fucking cop while you're at it.

144
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:06,999
Colosseum's tonight, and I won't have it
fucked up because of you.

145
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,794
Hey, instead of whining about it,

146
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:12,588
why don't you go find that bitch
and the video?

147
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,132
If you don't hold up your end,
you can forget my people.

148
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:18,844
I'm not gonna do jack shit for you,
you fucking pissant.

149
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:19,929
Do you understand?

150
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,267
Now, get the fuck outta my car.

151
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,280
CHIEF PROSECUTOR TAK JUIL

152
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:43,953
Do you think that Tak
is also in the video?

153
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:48,082
Either way, the Prosecutors' Office
won't make this easy.

154
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:51,043
It's likely that either
the charge will be killed or I will.

155
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,337
Man.

156
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,799
I never know
when you're being serious.

157
00:11:58,718 --> 00:11:59,719
I've got an idea…

158
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,639
to get around our prosecutor problem.

159
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,813
But I'll need your help to do it.

160
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,527
We've found a critical witness
regarding the Gangnam case.

161
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,113
If we can get him to talk,
we can definitely crack the case.

162
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:20,197
But?

163
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,367
We think Chief Prosecutor Tak's involved.

164
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,786
Even if we bring hard evidence
to Central District,

165
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,288
Tak will just have it buried.

166
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:33,878
This is why you're here then?

167
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,714
You wanna speculate about Tak?

168
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:40,551
I know you've got connections with
inspectors at the Prosecutor's Office.

169
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:41,886
Once they take over the case,

170
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,971
Prosecutor Tak won't be able
to mess with it.

171
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:45,765
Min Seojin, was it?

172
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:52,354
When you're invited into someone's yard,
it doesn't mean you're family.

173
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,148
Now, you're welcome to finish your tea.

174
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:56,025
I need a glass of water.

175
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:02,490
You know Tak's gonna be transferred
to the Presidential Office, don't you?

176
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:06,327
At the end of the day,
you two have the same goal.

177
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:10,456
So why don't we just think of this
as you eliminating the competition?

178
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:21,300
If you answer whatever they ask,
they'll make you a deal.

179
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:23,344
That's why we're keeping
this meeting under wraps.

180
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:24,637
I don't care about me.

181
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,222
Just make sure Jaehee's okay.

182
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,890
I get it. It's cool.

183
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,559
I have no interest
in dragging anybody down.

184
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,994
Thank you for coming
such a long way, Inspector.

185
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:51,831
Well, I'm only here because of
Assemblyman Moon,

186
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,749
who asked me directly to get involved.

187
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,501
Now, are you sure about this?

188
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,671
Once I begin, things will get hairy.

189
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,715
It's one of your own
that you're trying to investigate.

190
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:05,052
And I'm sure you know the implications.

191
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:10,933
Okay.

192
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:14,311
Let's begin.

193
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,898
Oh, um, sir…

194
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,276
Prosecutor Min
is on sick leave today.

195
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,611
She's feeling under the weather,
so, uh, I, um…

196
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:33,581
So you're saying this organization
called Gangnam Trading Company

197
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:36,500
is the cover for all these operations,
that right?

198
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,669
And Noh Joonseo is the top manager?

199
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:39,587
Yeah.

200
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,840
And Noh Joonseo killed
both Lee Junghwa and Lee Gangsu.

201
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:46,010
But yet you have no evidence.

202
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:55,227
So, tell me. How do you know
all of this extraordinary information?

203
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:59,607
I raised the stakes,
and then all of a sudden

204
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:59,607
I raised the stakes,
and then all of a sudden

205
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,525
the good ones came rushing over.

206
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,152
Yeah, yeah, but don't worry.

207
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:05,905
I did this just for the Chinese
and the Thai investors.

208
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:10,200
It's going to be an action-packed event.
You'll be very satisfied.

209
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,577
Okay.

210
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:18,918
HERE ARE THE PARTICIPANTS

211
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,377
BETTING STARTS
AT 100 MILLION WON

212
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:23,797
DIVIDEND PAID IN COLOSSEUM COINS

213
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,008
LET THE REAL-TIME VOTING BEGIN

214
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,259
I'M IN

215
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,538
- Hey, my man!
- What the hell, motherfucker!

216
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:59,541
Why do you knock if you're just
gonna fuckin' barge in?

217
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,211
Fuck. You don't even call me "Mr. Noh."

218
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,712
Where's the respect?

219
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:04,964
I apologize.

220
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:09,134
Well, I have some news
that you should know.

221
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,136
What is it now?

222
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,807
One of Yoon Gilho's girls.
Someone named Oh Jinyoung is here.

223
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:18,268
She says Jaehee came to see her
earlier today and…

224
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,814
I thought you'd be
happy to hear the news, so…

225
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:29,279
Hi.

226
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:38,914
Let's go.

227
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:40,874
Where?

228
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,835
You're the main witness now, my friend.

229
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:46,005
So, if something happens,
they're gonna blame me.

230
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,686
You guys are in the same business.

231
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:03,272
People like you gotta help each other out.
No?

232
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,274
Same business, my ass.

233
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,652
Don't compare me to this asshole.

234
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:11,822
We provide a service.

235
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,158
He's just a broker.

236
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,453
All right, all right.

237
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:18,787
Let's keep it cordial, kids.

238
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,873
Let's not pick a fight. Okay?

239
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:22,708
Okay?

240
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,251
- Yeah.
- Yes, sir.

241
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,231
My God. What's he doing?

242
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,274
Oh, man.

243
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:48,567
- Hey, what the hell?
- What the…

244
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,236
Why the hell are you taking your dick out?
The fuck?

245
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:55,115
- He's lost his mind.
- Oh, my God. I can't believe it.

246
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:59,244
What an absolute lunatic!

247
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:06,543
Jungkwon.

248
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,255
I'm sorry.

249
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:11,673
What's wrong?

250
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:13,801
- Get him.
- What the fuck?

251
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,844
Fuck.

252
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,351
Let go! I said let go,
you fucking…

253
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:25,604
- Let go of me!
- No, no! They don't have anywhere to go.

254
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:27,314
Jungkwon!

255
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:34,196
Hey, Jungkwon.

256
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,490
You're close with Yoon Gilho.

257
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:39,076
You fuck, what do you want?

258
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:43,038
Just trying to save your life here, buddy.

259
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,498
Come on.

260
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:52,381
Jungkwon, are you okay?

261
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,049
<i>Yoon Gilho was right.</i>

262
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,844
<i>All the security cameras in the hotel
were turned off that day</i>

263
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,637
<i>when he brought out Lee Junghwa's body.</i>

264
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:02,558
<i>They say it's their policy to turn
all the cameras off for safety checks</i>

265
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,309
<i>whenever they deep-clean the building.</i>

266
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:06,311
"Deep-clean"?

267
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:09,273
<i>Yeah, they said the people from
the company called Hangil Cleaning Service</i>

268
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:11,024
<i>come once a month for cleaning.</i>

269
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,110
<i>I tried calling them,
but it's not a working number.</i>

270
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:15,612
- <i>I think they're all in this together.</i>
- All right.

271
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,990
Hey, do you know
this Hangil Cleaning Service?

272
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:19,241
They came to clean the hotel.

273
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:22,077
Maybe the incineration team.
I saw the name on a van.

274
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:24,454
Wait a minute, you know their name?

275
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,165
Why didn't you tell us this sooner,
you punk?

276
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,375
Fuck, you know, they're not idiots.

277
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:30,711
They change their business name regularly.

278
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,254
So, I don't fucking know either.

279
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:36,800
I didn't say anything
'cause that prosecutor was annoying.

280
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:41,597
I really didn't like that prick either.

281
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:54,735
How do you know Jaehee?

282
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:01,200
She's a friend of my daughter.

283
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:04,912
My daughter, Yeseo, asked me to find her
because she couldn't get a hold of her.

284
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:08,540
Yeseo?

285
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:09,791
You mean, Kang Yeseo?

286
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,087
You know Yeseo, do ya?

287
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,927
I met her a few times through Jaehee.

288
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,387
Why do they have the same tattoo?

289
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,597
Huh?

290
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,934
Did you guys force her to get it?
Was she ever threatened?

291
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:28,227
By who?

292
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:30,646
By us?

293
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:33,774
We're all friends, man.

294
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:38,487
What the fuck did you do to Yeseo?

295
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,698
Did you push that innocent girl
to do something sketchy?

296
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,243
Did you?

297
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:45,911
"Sketchy"?

298
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:49,623
Like what?

299
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,919
You wanna know
if we sold your daughter off?

300
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:55,504
Watch your mouth, asshole!

301
00:20:58,632 --> 00:20:59,675
Hey.

302
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:04,054
You ever see
all the burn marks on her?

303
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,348
She had a ton on her arm.

304
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:09,893
Isn't a tattoo
better than some cigarette scars?

305
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:15,816
And what were you doing
while Yeseo was in so much pain, huh?

306
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:17,150
Huh?

307
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:20,070
So much that she had to come
to people like us?

308
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:24,366
Just remember, you're her father.

309
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,160
Don't act all superior.

310
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:30,247
Your daughter is no different than us.

311
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,036
Who's this?

312
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:11,413
A good friend.

313
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:14,374
Hi. How are you?

314
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:15,459
Hey, Kim Jaehee.

315
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:18,170
- Oh, for fuck's sake.
- The hell?

316
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:21,673
What is this?
Is she part of the family now?

317
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:22,924
Oh, don't be a cunt.

318
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,384
Come on, man. Just do it.

319
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:25,844
She wants it.

320
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,055
Why do you want it?

321
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:30,182
It's a lot of pain, you know?

322
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:31,641
I need to get used to pain. So…

323
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:34,728
Hey. Cut the bullshit. Stop it.

324
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:36,813
And you, get out.

325
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,525
I mean it. I'm serious,
take this girl home!

326
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,110
Could you give me one here,

327
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,364
like the one you did for Jaehee?

328
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:37,374
So, you've been sick?

329
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:40,710
You, uh… You feeling better?

330
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:42,838
Yes.

331
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:45,799
Oh, well. What can you do?

332
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:50,345
Captain Ju's dead.
We have to just drop the indictment.

333
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:53,974
Anyway, good work though.

334
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:59,563
Did you need anything further
from me, sir?

335
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:00,689
That's it.

336
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,191
You may go.

337
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:23,670
Oh, my God!

338
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:27,924
The great Inspector General
has paid a visit to my humble office.

339
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:31,219
Why, your flattery skills
are getting better every day.

340
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,222
Looks like you've been playing
a lot of golf. You look a little tan.

341
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:37,934
Oh, you know me, still hackin' away!

342
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,565
Is everything all right?

343
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:46,610
The Inspector General's protecting
Prosecutor Tak.

344
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:49,571
Their wives were college friends,
turns out.

345
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:50,947
Oh, fuck.

346
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,240
Oh, for fuck's sake.

347
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,117
That's fucking great.

348
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:58,872
Of course he'd be on the side
of the prosecution.

349
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,340
I invited a YTN journalist to do a story.

350
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:10,300
What?

351
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:12,219
Yoon Gilho will stir up enough buzz.

352
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,972
Once we expose this prostitution ring
to the public,

353
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:18,016
there won't be anything
the prosecutor can do.

354
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:19,100
You insane?

355
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:23,396
As soon as this story gets out,
the lives of these kids are ruined.

356
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,315
So what am I supposed to do?

357
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:26,441
We need evidence!

358
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,276
That's why I'm working my ass off
right now.

359
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,569
For what?

360
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,572
We won't be able to go through
official channels.

361
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,867
You've been solving all your cases
the same way?

362
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:38,537
As long as you get the results you want
doesn't matter how you get there?

363
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,676
{\an8}JINYOUNG

364
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,344
THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE ME
TO THE COLOSSEUM

365
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:55,512
JAEHEE, HELP ME!

366
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:59,307
<i>"Jaehee, save me."</i>

367
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:00,684
<i>You see this, you bitch?</i>

368
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:04,104
<i>Hey, if you want to save your friends,
you better get your ass over here.</i>

369
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,107
It tastes so good.

370
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,526
You eat this every day.

371
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:10,902
You still think it's good?

372
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,320
Yeah, it's fine.

373
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:16,241
I'M GOING TO THE COLOSSEUM

374
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,119
See? It's good.

375
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:24,082
- Hey, you little shit!
- Stop. Stop it.

376
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:30,630
{\an8}IF I DON'T MAKE IT,
PROTECT THE REST OF OUR FAMILY

377
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,384
{\an8}WE CAN'T REPEAT WHAT HAPPENED
TO JUNGHWA

378
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:36,052
{\an8}WHERE ARE YOU?
I'LL GO NOW

379
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,097
LET ME FINISH WHAT I STARTED

380
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,390
PROTECT OUR FAMILY, OKAY?

381
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:43,852
I'll do it.

382
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:46,271
Everybody get some food?

383
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:47,480
- Yes, sir.
- Welcome back.

384
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:50,567
Where's the dickhead?

385
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:52,861
Oh. You didn't see him on the way in?

386
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:57,032
We'll split up and handle it
in our own ways. I'll take Yoon Gilho.

387
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:59,367
What kind of bullshit are you pulling?

388
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:05,665
Hey. What is it?

389
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:09,878
Dongwoo, the dickhead, uh…
The kid I was watching, he disappeared.

390
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:12,172
Goddamn it!

391
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:16,926
Where are you now? I told you to stay put.

392
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,011
<i>Stay put?</i>

393
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:19,596
<i>Until when?</i>

394
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,974
Until Jaehee goes to the Colosseum
and gets herself killed while I stay put?

395
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,351
The Colosseum?

396
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:26,853
You don't even know
what the Colosseum is?

397
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:28,938
Why don't you quit wasting my time
and tell me?

398
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:34,194
Oh, it's just where rich assholes gather
and bet money on some real bloody shit.

399
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,198
You fucking asshole cop!

400
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:39,949
Fuck!

401
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,494
This whole fucking mess

402
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,538
is 'cause you couldn't handle
your own investigation.

403
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:46,539
Are you all right?

404
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:49,250
<i>That's why people are dying
in the middle of fucking Gangnam…</i>

405
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,878
- Shouldn't you go to the hospital?
- <i>…And these bastards feel safe to do</i>

406
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:54,631
- <i>whatever the fuck they want.</i>
- I'm actually running late for work, so…

407
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,300
At the Colosseum, perhaps?

408
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:59,344
Oh, yeah, that's right.

409
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,805
Are you going there too?

410
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:04,391
So, where's this bloody shit
going down, huh?

411
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:06,851
<i>I gotta tell you everything?</i>

412
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,229
<i>It's in the basement floor
of Hotel Carmen.</i>

413
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:12,440
What a coincidence. It's right by us.

414
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,984
<i>Isn't there even a police station nearby?</i>

415
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:25,495
Fine, I get it. So you just stay there.
I'll take care of it.

416
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:26,788
<i>I'm gonna end this.</i>

417
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:29,916
- No. You're gonna get yourself killed!
- <i>I don't care.</i>

418
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:32,335
You guys keep doing whatever you're doing.

419
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:35,046
<i>I'll do this my way.</i>

420
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:44,055
Stupid fucking kid!

421
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:48,476
Hello, everyone. I'm the third manager
of Gangnam Trading Company,

422
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,687
Jjooni Boy, Noh Joonseo.

423
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:55,108
Introducing myself here like this
makes me feel a bit like…

424
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,778
Hey, thank you. See you later.

425
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:00,989
Hold on.

426
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:05,952
Was thinking we could just have fun
by ourselves here?

427
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:07,287
What do you say?

428
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,456
<i>Are you all excited?</i>

429
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,293
You go ahead.
I'll meet you a little later.

430
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:14,794
Weren't you meeting a reporter?

431
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:16,796
Aren't you missing a warrant?

432
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:20,800
Now, then. Allow me to present
the marvelous creatures

433
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:23,261
who will fulfill your every desire!

434
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:33,313
Here's to you getting out alive!

435
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:42,155
Within the next hour, one final
contestant will win two billion won.

436
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:47,452
I hope the players you've chosen
will reward you with a massive jackpot.

437
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,748
Okay, let's get it!

438
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,442
What the fuck are you doing? Fight!

439
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:28,785
Money! Think about the money!

440
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,457
Oh, shit. Look, look.

441
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,926
Jinyoung, Jinyoung, wake up.

442
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,262
Oh Jinyoung, wake up.

443
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:51,140
Let me out, you fuckers!

444
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,395
What do you think, sir?

445
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:56,980
With great risk comes great reward.

446
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:58,940
You bet, Mr. Noh.

447
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:01,442
And don't worry about the outside,
all right, I'm covering it.

448
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:02,610
Have fun! Okay?

449
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,028
Okay!

450
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:09,576
TOTAL SERVICE

451
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:11,411
What do you guys need?
This area's restricted.

452
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:13,997
Here to help you guys out tonight.

453
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,332
Yeah, sorry we're running late,
didn't call earlier.

454
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,418
There weren't any requests for help.
Now, please leave.

455
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:20,545
Ah, my mistake.

456
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:37,604
Wait, did you…

457
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:42,817
He's out. Fuck it!

458
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:09,928
I'm sorry.

459
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,721
You have nothing to be sorry for.

460
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:13,848
Let's go.

461
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:29,072
Hey. Just step on it.

462
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:30,073
- Seriously?
- Just do it.

463
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:32,533
Come on, before they get suspicious.

464
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,327
- Go. Let's go!
- Go now. Go.

465
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,120
Fucker.

466
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:37,246
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

467
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:40,375
Hey, stop them!

468
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,544
- All right. My bad.
- What are you doing now?

469
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:46,381
- It was just an accident.
- Yes, indeed. It was an accident.

470
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:50,009
- Move your car. Your car.
- It was a sudden acceleration, you see.

471
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:11,572
Finally, we meet.

472
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,867
Jenny, didn't you miss me?

473
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:28,798
Who the hell are you? Wait!

474
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:37,265
So do you… do you have it?

475
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:39,726
The video.

476
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,482
You motherfucker. What are you doing here?

477
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,317
I'm here to pay back your money.

478
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:01,372
NO VIDEO FOUND

479
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:03,166
You fucking bitch.

480
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,255
Fuck.

481
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:13,593
Whoa. Hold it.

482
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,187
You fucking…

483
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:27,982
Fucking bitch.

484
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:31,069
Fuck you, fucking slut.

485
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:34,322
How dare you touch me
with your filthy hands?

486
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:37,033
Fucking bitch!

487
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:43,998
Sluts are filthy?

488
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,293
You piece of shit.

489
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,920
Just kill me.

490
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:51,881
Just do it!

491
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:57,053
If you kill me,
they'll all get posted online.

492
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,556
All the videos.

493
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:03,518
Your fans are gonna love it.

494
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:15,947
I'd kill you right now,
but delivering you is still the deal,

495
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,074
so I guess I'll have to wait.

496
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:45,268
Wow! This guy is next level, huh?

497
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:48,646
Probably because he's been street trash
his whole life.

498
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:53,359
But isn't it rude
to crash someone else's party?

499
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:54,861
It really is!

500
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:57,488
Noh Joonseo, you fuck.

501
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,284
Where's Jaehee?

502
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:02,368
Who?

503
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,453
Oh, right.

504
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:07,206
Fuck.

505
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:09,542
Are you talking about this fucking slut?

506
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:19,343
You motherfucker!

507
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,095
You son of a bitch!

508
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,811
Let's go! Let's go! Yeah.

509
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:31,647
Open the gate, you motherfucker!

510
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:32,982
Let's go make that money!

511
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:36,944
Get in there, motherfucker.
Get in there and make that money!

512
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:42,241
Whoever takes out that street
trash will receive my personal stake

513
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:45,828
on top of the prize money,
two billion won.

514
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:50,082
Okay. Let's get it!

515
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:05,681
Arrest these men. They are absolute trash.

516
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,059
Where's Captain Kang?

517
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,484
- That's it!
- Get a good look at him.

518
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:19,487
Yeah. Feast your eyes on that, girl.

519
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:23,491
Mr. Noh, we have an issue outside.

520
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:27,119
That prosecutor bitch
and Kang Dongwoo's guys

521
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,537
came with a warrant.

522
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:29,872
What the fuck?

523
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:32,124
- You had one job, fuckers.
- Let's wrap it up, okay?

524
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:34,210
Or I will seriously be fucked!

525
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:35,419
