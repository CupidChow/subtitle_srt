You can't find this stuff anywhere else.

00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,419
Forget it then, just don't buy it.
I don't give a shit.

You fucking junkie. Did I not tell you
to never sell drugs to my girls?

182
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,439
[grunting] It wasn't me.

183
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:01,317
That fucking bitch, Oh Jinyoung, begged
me to give her some drugs, all right?

184

-Come here, come here.

00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:12,202
Hey, don't you ever
sell again to my girls.

187
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:13,662
-Got it?
-[panting]

188
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:14,747

Hey. Hey, is Jenny here?

191
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:24,298
She's this bitch who fucked us over
and ran away.

192
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:26,842
I can go inside and check, right?
Hey, get inside.

193
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,969
-[bouncer 2] Let's get in.
-You guys, go over there.

194
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,221
-Damn it.
-Now where the hell did she go?

00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:02,878
Shit, man. Why didn't you fucking pick up?

202
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,672
Get another girl.

203
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,840
Jinyoung's pretty baked.
She can't work today.

204
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:10,552
Forget about her right now.
Do you know what happened to Jaehee?

205
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:11,971
What?

206
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:15,140
Seems like during her shift last night,
she disappeared. She's gone.

207
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,184
Everyone is out there looking for her.

208
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:22,314
I can't reach Junghwa either.
Did something happen to the girls?

She's really not fucking picking up.

213
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,009
Could she just be working?

214
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,135
No.

[sighs] Mr. Yoon,
what the hell are you doing?

218
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:03,272
That bitch is ignoring my calls.
You sure Junghwa didn't run?

219
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,566
Got to go.

220
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,747
We don't know anything.

221

-Is this road for tractors or something?
-[officer] Well…

Huh?

243
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:54,216

[officer] Captain,
I thought you took the day off.

00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,693
Sir, are you okay? You hurt?

251
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:14,278
No, don't worry. It's okay, I'm fine.

252
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:16,822
It was just a minor collision. [chuckles]

253
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:19,533
The insurance company is arriving.
We can handle this on our own.

254
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:20,826
So you can go, Captain.

255
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,539
You drunk? You look flushed.

256
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:27,791
That's just the way my face is, man.

-Can't you tell? [laughs]
-[partner laughs]

258

He's the mayor's, uh, second nephew.

259
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,590
Apparently, he drank a bit
while playing golf.

260
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,008
We've settled with the old man,

261
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:38,427
and also, the chief called
and said we should just let him go.

Whoa, pretty dark in there.
I can't see anything at all.

Hey, hey, hey! Fine, fine, fine, fine.

a cup of coffee, okay?

-Huh?
-Hey, we have a situation.

Take him to the police station

291
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,777
if you don't want to
get arrested for bribery too.

292
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,279
-Got it?
-Yes, Captain.

293
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,116
-Let go of me, you motherfuckers.
-Stop, don't touch me.

294
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:27,077
Did you have to use excessive force
on the mayor's nephew, seriously?

[partner] What are we supposed to do?

299
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:42,843
Oh, I see. You lead one big
drug bust in Gangnam,

300
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:45,470

everyone's a dealer, that it?

00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:28,180
I assumed you'd be bored out of your mind
out here in the middle of nowhere,

So I'm wondering if you
could be the ace up our sleeve.

321
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:50,452
Seriously, Dongwoo, you can't waste
your gift here forever.

322
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:54,998
I didn't mentor you so you could toil
away in a quiet little town like this.

325

I want you back in Gangnam immediately.

326
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:04,466
Pack your bags. You'll do everything
you can to get through the case

327
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,176
faster than the prosecution.

328
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:08,261
Okay?

329
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:13,100
Commissioner, I won't do it.

330
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,185
I can't do this.

331
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:20,774
Why not?

332
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,569
Are you worried a cop
will be involved again?

333

The bastards you caught,

334
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,908

they were moles in the end, Dongwoo.

00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:39,978
-[bouncer 3] <i>Get her!</i>
-[onlooker] <i>Wait, no, no, no, stop--</i>

345
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:42,063
[horns honking]

346
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:46,109
[onlookers shout]

347
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:57,329
[phone buzzing]

348
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:01,082
Hello?

349
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,793
[caller] <i>Are you the father</i>
<i>of our patient Kang Yeseo?</i>

350
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:06,213
Yeah. What's the matter?

351
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:09,799
GANGNAM MAEIL HOSPITAL

352
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:12,594
What happened?
I heard she was doing a lot better.

353
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:14,221
[doctor] Yes, she was.

354
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:17,682
That's why we reduced her therapy
to biweekly sessions.

355
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:21,144
However, she's become very anxious lately
for some reason.

356
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:25,565
Take a look.

357
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:30,320
[doctor] <i>Are you still troubled</i>
<i>by what happened back then?</i>

358
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,198
[Yeseo] <i>I said I'm not.</i>

359
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:36,493
[doctor] <i>It's not your fault, Yeseo.</i>
<i>You can tell me.</i>

360
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:40,789
<i>Are you still feeling troubled by it?</i>

361
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:50,966
-<i>Yeseo! Nurse!</i>
-[Yeseo shouting]

362
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,009
<i>Nurse, we need to escort her out.</i>

363
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:55,345
-<i>Bring the tranquilizer, come on.</i>
-<i>Let me go!</i> [grunts]

364
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:57,639
-[Yeseo screaming]
-<i>Calm down, calm down!</i>

365
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:01,518
[doctor] I know you and your wife
are both busy,

366
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:03,645
<i>but you need to watch her more closely.</i>

367
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:06,356
<i>For someone who has</i>
<i>attempted suicide once,</i>

368
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:08,775
<i>the second and third attempts</i>
<i>become even easier.</i>

369
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,397
[door opens, shuts]

370
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:52,944
[parent] You can't just show up
on whatever day

371
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,696
outside of the visitation schedule.

372
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:55,780
What about you?

373
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,533
You need to be on TV
while our child is suffering?

374
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,285
Had I known, I wouldn't have.

375
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:03,955
I came straight from work
as soon as I heard.

376
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:07,417
[sighs]

377
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:11,588
What's happening with Yeseo?
It doesn't sound like things are okay.

378
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:13,256
[scoffs]

379
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,717
Are you acting like a father
all of a sudden?

380
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:19,429
I'm her father.
I have the right to know what's going on.

381
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:21,389
So you're saying you didn't know?

382
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:25,226
A cop who couldn't solve
a school bullying case.

383
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:29,773
When our daughter was being blackmailed
by those murderous skanks,

384
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:32,484
you were too busy obsessing
over those druggies.

385
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:36,321
You're a news anchor.
Why are you repeating such nonsense?

386
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:39,199
How many times do I have to tell you
it was an acciden--

387
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:40,742
[sighs]

388
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:44,287
Pushing a person from the roof
is not an accident, it's murder.

389
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:48,625
Those girls,
you know they were gaslighting Yeseo.

390
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:50,210
It was abusive.

391
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:25,745
[sighs]

392
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,799
IF YOU TAKE THIS OFF AGAIN,
YOU'LL GET ARRESTED!

393
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:43,638
[phone buzzes]

394
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:51,312
TREASURE:
I CAN BE DISCHARGED TOMORROW.

395
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:54,107
WILL YOU DRIVE ME HOME? PLEASE?

396
00:28:57,652 --> 00:28:58,653
[sighs]

397
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:06,494
Why won't you say anything? Seriously,
are you just gonna stay silent?

398
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,246
You fucking…

399
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:09,914
[sighs]

400
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:11,458
Hey, are you…

401
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:17,005
Are you involved with Noh Joonseo
in any way?

402
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:20,008
[sighs] I can't do this.

403
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,593
-Hey, Jaehee!
-What?

404
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:24,095
We're wasting time, we need to go get her!

405
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:29,809
What if something bad is happening
to Junghwa? What if she's in danger?

406
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:32,729
[sighs]

407
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,191
Shut your phone off. Just stay put here.

408
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:40,320
-What are you gonna do?
-I'll bring her here, so just stay put.

409
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:41,821
Don't make things worse.

410
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:45,784
[Jaehee] Please…

411
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:52,081
Bring her back.

412
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:07,305
Before you go,
how about some burgers? Huh?

413
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:10,016
I mean, you said you wanted
to try that new restaurant.

414
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:12,060
The one near your building.

415
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:14,979
That place closed a while ago.

416
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:19,734
How about that Chinese restaurant
we went to on your graduation day?

417
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:23,154
You know, the one with the dumplings
you like, and they had that sauce…

418
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:24,823
They had really good sauce, remember?

419
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:28,326
You mean the entrance ceremony.
You didn't come to my graduation.

420
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:32,789
[sighs]

421
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:42,298
-<i>Appa.</i>
-Yeah?

422
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:50,807
Can you look for my friend, Jaehee?

423
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:58,356
Jaehee, the girl with the leather jacket?

424
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:00,859
She's been MIA.

425
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:04,487
Her phone is turned off,

426
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:06,781
she's not answering DMs or texts.

427
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,158
I think something's happened to her.

428
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,828
You can help me find her, right?

429
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:16,624
[sighs] Yeseo,
why do you want to find her?

430
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:21,129
It's actually not unusual
for kids like her to go missing.

431
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:22,630
It's not that big of a deal.

432
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,340
I've seen a lot of them, you know?

433
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,301
How can you say that?

434
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:29,137
Oh, come on. Do you still not
understand who she really was?

435
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,431
So <i>Umma</i> told you
that Jaehee is responsible, didn't she?

436
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:35,184
I hope you don't believe that.

437
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:38,146
Well, it's not that.
I'm just worried about you--

438
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,355
No, you're not.

439
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,065
I've heard that before from you.

440
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:44,152
You say you're worried about me,
but you don't really care.

441
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:45,236
Do you?

442
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:47,113
[sighs]

443
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,956
[sighs]

444
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:07,425
You ignored me
the last time I asked you for a favor.

445
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:10,303
Why do you even want to find her? Huh?
What'll happen if you do?

446
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:11,930
[sighs]

447
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:18,186
Yeseo, is there something
you're not telling me about?

448
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:24,901
It's just…

449
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:33,326
I can't live in this world without her.

450
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:51,594
[phone buzzes]

451
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:08,319
[Dongwoo] Oh, hey, sorry about that.

452
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,154
-Hey, <i>Appa</i>.
-I'm a little late.

453
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:12,365
1 YEAR AGO

454
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:15,034
This is Jaehee, my best friend.

455
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:18,162
I see. Pleasure.

456
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:22,000
-I got to go.
-Hey, come on.

457
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,961
Let's just hang out and talk
for a little bit, okay?

458
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:27,046
-<i>Appa</i>, please.
-Okay.

459
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,132
I'm kind of hungry.
Why don't you get us some food?

460
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:31,509
Go ahead and get whatever you want. Here.

461
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:35,346
While you wait, why don't you two talk?

462
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:37,974
It's all right.

463
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,562
[Dongwoo] Shall we sit?

464
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,074
So you're friends from school?

465
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:57,243
[sighs]

466
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:02,248
Hey, gotta tell you.
I really love your leather jacket.

467
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:03,791
Your parents get you that?

468
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:08,796
Do I look like I have parents?

469
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,631
Can't you tell by looking at me?

470
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:12,800
You're a cop or something?

471
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:17,555
[sighs] All right. Tell me.
What do you need my help with?

472
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:25,146
Listen, it's okay. You can tell me.
What trouble did you cause?

473
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:28,274
Who said I caused it? [scoffs]

474
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:30,735
Do you need money
so you can settle something?

475
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:33,279
[chuckles] You're… You're such a dick.

476
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:35,823
Look.

477
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:40,328
You don't understand me.
Stop acting like it.

478
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,705
You don't get it, so just stop trying.

479
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:47,710
I know you don't even care
what happens to someone like me.

480
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:52,882
[scoffs] Unbelievable.

481
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:58,805
You got so much time on your hands,
you should treat your daughter better.

482
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,683
You think seeing her
every once in a while, buying her…

483
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:06,187
Getting her stuff like burgers
makes you a good parent?

484
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:11,984
Jaehee, was it?

485
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:15,530
I know you call yourself her friend,

486
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,990
drag her around to places
and threaten her for money.

487
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:18,991
Excuse me?

488
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:20,743
You have any idea what Yeseo
had to go through

489
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,537
because of what happened
on the roof that day?

490
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,163
[scoffs] This is bullshit.

491
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:27,792
Hey.

492
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:30,294
-If you ever bully Yeseo again, I'll…
-<i>Appa</i>!

493
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,631
Hey. This was stupid.

494
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,300
Your old man? Not fucking helpful.

495
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:37,552
Hey, hey.

496
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:40,388
Are you completely nuts?

497
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:42,515
What if we let her go
and something happens to her?

498
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:43,599
Yeseo.

499
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:47,645
Yeseo.

500
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:51,732
[sighs]

501
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:56,028
GANGNAM SEOBU POLICE STATION,
SEOUL

502
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:59,282
WITHOUT YOUR HELP,
BULLYING AT SCHOOL WILL CONTINUE

503
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:00,658
[Jisu] We meet again.

504
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:06,330
When you ran away, was it out of guilt?

505
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:11,043
I was wondering why you were sent to the
countryside after you were promoted.

506
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:13,546
Then we found out it was by choice.

507
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:16,757
Why'd you run away? They were
the ones who were committing the crimes.

508
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:19,385
[scoffs] It wasn't your fault
they ostracized you.

509
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:22,597
If we could travel back in time
and face the same predicament,

510
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,183
Jangho would deserve
to be crushed by you, Captain.

511
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:30,479
If you hadn't done it, I swear,
I would have ended that punk myself.

512
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:32,398
Fuck him.

513
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:35,610
Was it at least therapeutic?

514
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:39,947
-You know, comforting and all?
-Oh, yeah.

515
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:43,784
It feels so much safer teaming up
with another loner down here.

516
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,995
What brought you in out of the cold?

517
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:48,497
NAME: KIM JAEHEE

518
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:52,001
Geez, I thought Yeseo was a nerd,
but she has a pretty scary friend.

519
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:53,169
LARCENY - ASSAULT

520
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:56,797
This girl was arrested for committing
larceny in Yeongdeungpo a while back.

521
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:58,799
That's her only charge.

522
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:00,760
Hmm.

523
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:04,055
Oh, here she is.

524
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:07,433
-Huh. Wait a minute.
-What?

525
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:11,479
Remember how we arrested those thugs
connected to the dark web some time ago?

526
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:13,898
-Mm-hmm.
-They were released about half a year ago.

527
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,400
Are those perverts already out?

528
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:20,363
Yeah, not only that but these bastards
are operating a spy cam business now.

529
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:23,741
They still haven't learned their lesson.

530
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:27,828
They set up spy cams in all the clubs,
bars and bathrooms in Gangnam.

531
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:30,206
I wanted to root out
those stupid bastards,

532
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:33,709
so I went through all the CCTV
in that area several times.

533
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:35,461
Oh, here. Look.

534
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:36,671
GANGNAM CLUB GIRL IN BATHROOM

535
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:39,298
Same tattoo, right?

536
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:45,972
She sleeps here like this until some dude
shows up and takes her out.

537
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:48,349
Seemed odd, so I took a closer look.

538
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:51,060
Is that it? Any footage from outside?

539
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,940
This was recorded first.
And this is the footage that followed.

540
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,859
Oh, there she is.

541
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:01,195
In the next clip,

542
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:04,532
they get into the car in the back.

543
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,076
Wait, there's another girl.

544
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,870
I mean,
she kind of looks like her, though.

545
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:11,956
Doesn't she? Right?

546
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:16,794
Stop.

547
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:20,214
[Jisu] It's her. She has the same tattoo.

548
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:22,717
[sighs]

549
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:27,972
Mmm.

550
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:30,099
[Jisu] What?

551
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:34,020
That looks like that bastard from before.

552
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,191
3 YEARS AGO

553
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,652
All right, yeah, I know.
Just get in the car first. Come on.

554
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:44,530
[Gilho] Come here, you fucking junkie.
Hey!

555
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:47,450
Motherfucker. Hey! Let me fucking go!

556
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:48,993
What the hell are they doing?

557
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:50,411
I think he drives call girls,

558
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,747
according to him,
the man robbed his client.

559
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:56,250
If I do drugs or have sex, it's none of
your damn business, fucker-- Ow!

560
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:58,711
[Gilho] Fuck you. [grunts]

561
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:01,964
Fuck! [grunts]

562
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:04,633
-[officer] Hey, get him!
-You motherfucker!

563
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:07,261
Hey! You fucking piece of shit!

564
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:09,638
-Get him up.
-[Gilho] Come here, you fucking junkie!

565
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:10,723
[officer] Get up.

566
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:16,145
-Where's the woman who was with him?
-Over there. In the back.

567
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:18,647
Is that your girl?

568
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:20,232
I'm just a chauffeur.

569
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:22,401
You're the one who drove her here,
weren't you?

570
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,820
So what? You think chauffeurs
pick their damn clients?

571
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:28,032
Oh, because cops pick
which criminals to arrest?

572
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:30,701
-[chuckles] What?
-[scoffs] Let's take him to the station.

573
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,661
-Why bother talking to him?
-Hey, you son of a bitch.

574
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:35,289
Come here, you fucker.
Come on, you bastard.

575
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:38,626
-Just get out of here.
-[Jisu] What? We're letting him go?

576
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,961
[Dongwoo] You're gonna waste our resources
on a chauffeur?

577
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:44,382
Here. Wipe your face off.
It doesn't look nice.

578
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:50,179
You motherfucker. You'd better fucking run
if you ever see me, you fucking bitch.

579
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:51,430
[chuckles]

580
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:53,349
[Dongwoo] Let him go.

581
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,936
[Gilho sighs] Goddamn junkie.

582
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:03,776
Hey, you'd better not show up
on my radar again.

583
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:12,993
I wanted to run the license plate,
but we can't run the plate or the ID.

584
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,454
Apparently the prosecution blocked access

585
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:17,331
because the evidence
is crucial to their case?

586
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:18,749
Why are they involved?

587
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,084
The new chief prosecutor

588
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:22,837
assigned the evidence
related to Gangnam Missing Persons Cases,

589
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,755
to some random prosecutor.

590
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:27,383
They even restricted access
on all of the files.

591
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:30,261
-[employee] Okay. Thanks.
-Oh, dear.

592
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:32,179
Oh, you didn't
have to bring this yourself.

593
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,639
I would've been there to help…

594
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,517
Ms. Ryu,
we are free this afternoon, right?

595
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:40,938
Yes, we don't have anything in particular.
What can I do for you, ma'am?

596
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:44,108
Please don't disturb me,
and go home on time.

597
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:58,122
THE 2ND GANGNAM GATE MATERIAL

598
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:04,920
GANGNAM SERIAL MISSING PERSONS
CASES MATERIAL

599
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,131
Hey, man.

600
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:10,634
You need to give me the money first,
like you promised.

601
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:14,930
I mean, I'm putting my fucking life
on the line for you.

602
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:19,518
[sighs] Whatever. Just hurry
and wire the money to my bank account.

603
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:21,979
Right now.

604
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:27,401
[sighs] For fuck's sake.
This asshole just doesn't get it.

605
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:31,197
Oh, shit.

606
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:37,703
What?

607
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,664
-Get out.
-You get in, motherfucker.

608
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:46,712
-[whimpers]
-Come on out.

609
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:49,381
Where did you take Junghwa?

610
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:53,010
I did my thing,
made the delivery, got my money as usual.

611
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:54,637
-Where?
-[groans] All right!

612
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,348
All right… [sobs] …it was
Grand Business Hotel.

613
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:00,226
Grand Business. There's an event.

614
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:02,937
-When's the event?
-It's already begun.

615
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:05,022
You should hurry.

616
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:07,942
Why are you getting up?

617
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:10,444
Please stop. Please… [sobbing] …stop!

618
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:13,489
-Please don't-- [shouts]
-[trunk slamming]

619
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:19,495
You motherfucker…

620
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:22,039
-[whimpering]
-[sighs]

621
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:29,880
-[radio beeps]
-Going in.

622
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:34,176
[Junghwa breathes shakily]

623
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:37,471
-[captor] Hey, move your ass, would you?
-[whimpers]

624
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:39,682
Just go.

625
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:50,776
[gasps]

626
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:54,071
-[scanner beeps]
-[lock clicks]

627
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:04,081
[gasps]

628
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,793
Hey, there.

629
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:09,837
It's been a while, Junghwa.

630
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:13,090
[distorted] Too long, baby, too long.

631
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:15,467
[Junghwa breathing heavily]

632
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:19,888
[yelps]

633
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:49,793
[breathes shakily]
