(Don't Touch Me)

3
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,600
What do you want?

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,960
Ruheng.

5
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,399
I didn't kill anyone.

6
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,679
Never would I harm Concubine Yu.

7
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,399
I like you.

8
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,880
So I sent pastries
to Concubine Yu's palace every day.

9
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,719
I really didn't know

10
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,079
that the pastries were poisoned.

11
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,200
Please trust me.

12
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,000
I know it.

13
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,039
Otherwise, we wouldn't save you.

14
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:53,439
Ruheng.

15
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:55,079
Previously,

16
00:00:56,439 --> 00:00:58,759
I just didn't like Sheng Yueling.

17
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,399
But everything I did

18
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,656
was because I like you.

19
00:01:02,656 --> 00:01:03,240
That's why...

20
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,200
No need to say more.

21
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:09,319
I can let everything slide.

22
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,280
Just confirm one thing.

23
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,200
As long as I get the answer,

24
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:18,280
I will never bother you again.

25
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,040
Alright, go ahead.

26
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:23,239
Have you

27
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:27,000
ever liked me?

28
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:29,640
Never.

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,159
Before his death,
General Qin requested me

30
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,879
to look after you. That's all.

31
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:35,920
Look after?

32
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,599
This bracelet,

33
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,640
you asked someone to give it to me.

34
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,560
You promised to marry me
once you achieved military acclaim.

35
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:49,439
I've been waiting.

36
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,200
For so many years.

37
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,799
I never give things lightly.

38
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:57,439
I've never even seen

39
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,200
this bracelet.

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,959
It was Crown Prince.

41
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,560
Crown Prince said
you asked him to give it to me.

42
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,400
Crown Prince?

43
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:07,319
Now you know

44
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,159
the person who framed you

45
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,000
and wanted to kill you?

46
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,159
It's Crown Prince.

47
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:17,000
Everyone is his pawn,

48
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:18,439
including you.

49
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,360
It was all fake.

50
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,560
Whether you like me or not,

51
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:39,000
I have no regrets.

52
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,280
To my father's veteran comrades,

53
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:51,039
it's a symbol of my father.

54
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:54,039
Ruheng.

55
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,520
Kill Crown Prince for me.

56
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:14,360
Okay, I promise you.

57
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,159
Your Highness.

58
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:39,240
The assassin of Miss Qin
has been identified.

59
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,479
It's someone from Miao.

60
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,120
Someone from Miao?

61
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,080
He's long colluding with foreign states.

62
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:52,639
Your Highness, the assassination failed.

63
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,919
Qin Muyi was rescued and disappeared.

64
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,080
She's luckier than her father.

65
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,560
Back then, I passed the intelligence
to Miao's heir,

66
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,840
leading to her father's defeat
and death in battle.

67
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:09,960
Those ignorant of the times must perish.

68
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,159
Keep chasing to take down Qin Muyi.

69
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:13,879
Copy.

70
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,040
Your Highness, what about Prince Chen?

71
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,879
Keep watching.

72
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,920
Copy.

73
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,480
(Mask.)

74
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,959
Per Crown Prince's command,
I've deployed elite troops

75
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:46,480
throughout your palace.

76
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,240
From tomorrow,

77
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:50,000
we will protect

78
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,240
the safety of you and Princess.

79
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,800
Crown Prince has a message for you.

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
We are in the same boat as you.

81
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,199
The marriage alliance
was also a calculated move.

82
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:00,199
You are to monitor
the princess of Sheng.

83
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,600
If she has any hidden agenda,

84
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,160
eliminate her.

85
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,600
(So all of this was just an act.)

86
00:05:07,328 --> 00:05:10,160
(Chu Ruheng and the masked men
who killed the princess are in cahoots.)

87
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,759
(Could it be that the bandits we met)

88
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:14,120
(were also arranged by them?)

89
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,160
(Chu Ruheng)

90
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,680
(is the one who killed the princess.)

91
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,680
Then please bring a message
back to Crown Prince.

92
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:30,399
Should he commit to upholding Yu,

93
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,040
I'm happy to navigate.

94
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
But if

95
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:39,879
he wants to harm anyone by my side,

96
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,680
then I'll fight to death.

97
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,680
Your Highness, please watch your words.

98
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,319
Then who are you?
Talking to me like this?

99
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:49,279
Prince Chen.

100
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:51,240
Stay calm.

101
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,160

102
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:53,920
to protect you.

103
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,040
Protect?

104
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,560
Or monitor?

105
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,600
It...

106
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,279
It'll be trouble
if Crown Prince hears these words.

107
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:02,399
First, you need to stay alive
to pass on the words.

108
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,120
Your Highness, bad news.

109
