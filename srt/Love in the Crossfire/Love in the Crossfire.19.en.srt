=Love in the Crossfire=

2
00:00:12,084 --> 00:00:14,912
=Episode 19=
(Fight between Clam and Sandpiper)

3
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:19,359
It seems

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,079
I'm about to put on the dragon robe.

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,440
I vow to follow Your Highness
unto death,

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,719
pursuing the grand purpose.

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,280
Good.

8
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:31,320
As you find out,

9
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:35,320
Sheng Yueling of Sheng
knows no medicine,

10
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,159
right?

11
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:37,640
Yes, Your Highness.

12
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,920
Looks like the secret guards nailed it.

13
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,200
They've played a fake-it-all trick.

14
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:46,039
Interesting.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,560
Your Highness, Nan Xing sneaked into
the Eastern Palace.

16
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,799
As per your instructions,

17
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,719
he's guided to the defense map.

18
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:55,159
Good.

19
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,400
Looks like you've got some luck.

20
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,480
Yue.

21
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,879
Yue, let's go home.

22
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:07,120
Shall we?

23
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,520
Since it's all

24
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,280
a conspiracy
by Chu Ruheng and Crown Prince,

25
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,879
Why harm yourself?

26
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:31,039
What is this?

27
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:32,719
The real military defense map.

28
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,439
Where did you get this?

29
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,560
From the Eastern Palace.

30
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,479
What?

31
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:41,199
Yue, let's go.

32
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:17,319
My sword is not merciful.

33
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:19,159
If you don't surrender,

34
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,280
I can't promise

35
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,439
the safety of Princess Chen.

36
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,319
Take them down.

37
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:51,080
Your Highness, we've got trouble.

38
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,879
Crown Prince seized
Nan Xing and Princess.

39
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:53,599
What?

40
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I stole the map.

41
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,080
Princess was not involved.

42
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:57,560
Crown Prince.

43
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,240
It might be a misunderstanding.

44
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:00,360
Misunderstanding?

45
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,400
Do you know...

46
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,039
Let her go.

47
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:05,400
this defense map is the top secret
of my Yu State?

48
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,919
You should be executed for your crime.

49
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,199
Don't hurt her.

50
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,519
Nan Xing.

51
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:30,639
You saved my life

52
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,399
at the refugee camp.

53
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,160
Take it

54
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,279
whenever you want it back.

55
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:40,439
In the next life,

56
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,720
I'll still be your star,

57
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:46,600
accompanying you.

58
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,800
Nan Xing.

59
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,800
Nan Xing.

60
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,000
Throw this spy into the mass grave,

61
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,720
to feed wild dogs.

62
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,959
- Yes.
- Yes.

63
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:06,519
Let go of me.

64
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,079
Don't. Nan Xing.

65
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:10,319
Princess Chen.

66
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,399
Let go of me.

67
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:13,240
It's not difficult
if you want to save him.

68
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,439
All you have to do is

69
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,199
to name Chu Ruheng
as the mastermind behind all this.

70
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:19,120
In this way...

71
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,600
Stop.

72
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:31,079
Ruheng.

73
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:33,720
Will you execute this spy from Sheng

74
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,839
or kill the current Crown Prince?

75
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,079
Ruheng. Don't. Absolutely don't.

76
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,560
This defense map
is the top secret of Yu.

77
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:49,439
She deserves the death penalty.

78
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,720
Do you have evidence?

79
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,360
Caught red-handed.

80
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,079
The map was found on her.

81
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,279
Ruheng.

82
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:01,439
Don't blame your brother
for being heartless.

83
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:04,680
I still need to examine you
for this matter

84
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,800
before clearing your name.

85
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,000
According to Yu's laws,

86
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:17,279
take Princess Chen to the prison.

87
00:06:17,856 --> 00:06:19,959
Deploy heavy surveillance
over Prince Chen's Mansion.

88
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,040
No one may enter or leave,

89
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,920
for half a month.

90
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:31,319
Go.

91
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,680
Crown Prince sent a message

92
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:49,639
saying that you can make your move.

93
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:52,519
What's the rush.

94
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,319
When clams and sandpipers fight,
the fisherman benefits.

95
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:01,399
