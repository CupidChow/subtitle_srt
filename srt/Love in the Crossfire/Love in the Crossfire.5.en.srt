(Still Hurt?)

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,559
Here's your chance.

4
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:21,239
Tell me your true purpose.

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,399
Your Highness.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,839
I left my country to marry you

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,480
for our diplomatic relations,

8
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,359
and no suffering of people from wars.

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,200
You do have sharp wits.

10
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:39,640
But you trespassed into a forbidden area

11
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,119
and did something you shouldn't have.

12
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,880
Feeling the pain now?

13
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,240
Just a minor punishment

14
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,200
for warning.

15
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:14,120
Watch carefully.

16
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:35,000
Thorns are everywhere in this palace.

17
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,959
A little carelessness.

18
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,079
These thorns may take your life.

19
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:43,719
Should you have improper thoughts again,

20
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,879
and make a grave mistake,

21
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,040
I may not be able

22
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,040
to clear all thorns for you.

23
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,920
What thoughts?

24
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,840
What thorns?

25
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,239
I don't know what you mean.

26
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,000
Then just stay in the mansion.

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,800
Your Highness.

28
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,199
I'll deliver the medicine to Princess.

29
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:48,439
No.

30
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:52,879
I'll do it myself.

31
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:54,000
You may leave.

32
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,080
Yes.

33
00:02:58,599 --> 00:02:59,599
You hit her.

34
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,039
Then give her the medicine.

35
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:02,800

Your Highness.

57
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:13,120
Your Highness, are you feeling better?

58
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,480
Not really about this wind cold.

59
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:20,480
The headache is even harder to endure.

60
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,920
Luckily, I have this.

61
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,680
The medicine deliverer said

62
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,639
it should not be taken frequently.

63
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,439
The Emperor is not feeling well
recently.

64
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,160
I finally got to manage

65
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,519
the state affairs.

66
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,160
Our dynasty greatly values

67
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,000
the quality and virtues
of the one in throne.

68
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:38,759
The Empress Dowager and Ministers

69
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:41,360
are secretly assessing me as well.

70
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:44,680
I dare not show any hint of neglect.

71
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,360
Your Highness,
I'm concerned about your well-being.

72
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,079
I worry...

73
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:06,120
Your Highness.

74
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:08,240
Prince and Princess Chen
request an audience.

75
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,800
Is your wind illness flaring up?

76
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,439
(Wind illness?)

77
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,759
(Why the floral aroma?)

78
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:20,319
Possibly due to heavy court affairs.

79
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,879
Overwork.

80
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,959
Brother.

81
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,800
Summon the Physician.

82
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:28,360
His Highness is in his prime.

83
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,160
As far as I know,

84
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,600
blood-cough symptoms of wind illness

85
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,920
shouldn't come so swiftly.

86
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,079
(She knows medicine?)

87
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:47,000
From what happened,

88
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,519
His Highness should be bleeding
from a gut injury.

89
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,879
Your Highness, have you been taking

90
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:53,120
any pain-relieving medicines?

91
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,920
Surprisingly,
Princess Chen knows medicine.

92
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,120
Your wife is quite impressive.

93
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:11,079
I also just knew this.

94
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,079
Princess has studied medicine.

95
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:17,279
Your Highness, I'm flattered.

96
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,160
My prolonged illness from youth
gives me this medical insight.

97
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,319
So I know a little bit.

98
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:23,160
But, Your Highness,

99
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,000
this kind of pain-relieving medicine

100
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,120
only eases your pain briefly.

101
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,160
Do not take it for extended periods.

102
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,040
Otherwise, it's harmful.

103
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,879
Thank you for the reminder.

104
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,199
Reporting to Your Highness.

105
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,040
The Imperial Physician
is waiting at the door.

106
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,800
Summon.

107
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,759
How is it? I thought His Highness
suffers from a gut injury?

108
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:55,279
Indeed, Princess is correct.

109
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:57,199
His Highness is suffering
from a gut injury.

110
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:58,480
I'll prepare medicine now

111
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,879
for him.

112
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:06,360
(Seize this chance
to bond with Crown Prince.)

113
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,600
(It would be good
to expand the map search.)

114
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,439
Your Highness.

115
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:12,680
Acupuncture can alleviate wind illness.

116
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,279
I can administer acupuncture
for Your Highness.

117
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,639
The well-being of His Highness

118
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:18,959
is vital to Yu State.

119
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,399
It's no trivial matter.

120
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,639
Don't mess around.

121
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,639
(This Chu Ruheng)

122
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:25,680
(talks too much.)

123
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,839
(Getting in the way.)

124
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:28,480
Princess Chen's diagnosis

125
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:30,680
was proved by Imperial Physician.

126
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:34,000
I grant you permission
to administer acupuncture on me.

127
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,200
Brother.

128
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:35,919
Ruheng,

129
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:39,159
do you feel comfortable
to leave your Princess here with me?

130
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,559
How come.

131
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:48,039
I'm just concerned about your health.

132
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:49,480
Your Highness, can I ask

133
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,720
my servants from the mansion

134
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,000
to deliver the instruments here?

135
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,120
Yes, you can.

136
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,600
Nan Xing, I'll perform acupuncture
on Crown Prince.

137
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,799
You search the defense map.

138
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:03,519
No problem.

139
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:07,679
