(Familiar Presence)

3
00:00:43,456 --> 00:00:44,520
Princess, hold on.

4
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,840
(Wasted Hut, Outskirts, Yu State)
I'll cure you.

5
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,960
Yue.

6
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,679
From now on,

7
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,159
you are the Princess of Sheng State,
Sheng Yueling.

8
00:00:56,468 --> 00:00:57,000
(Prince Chen's Private Mansion,
Outskirts, Yu State)

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,119
Concubine Yu's death

10
00:00:58,719 --> 00:00:59,799
is full of doubts.

11
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:01,880
As a personal attendant,
you know nothing?

12
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,280
Princess, you will be alright.

13
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,359
You and Nan Xing

14
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,159
must complete the diplomatic marriage.

15
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,159
Everyone in Yu State knows

16
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:13,480
Prince Chen, her unfilial son,

17
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,560
killed Concubine Yu.

18
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,560
Stubborn.

19
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:23,959
Tell me.

20
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,920
Is Prince Chen attempting
to clear the shame

21
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:30,760
of being disobedient and unfilial?

22
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,400
Leveraging our deaths

23
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,239
to silence the public.

24
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,280
Princess.

25
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,000
Princess.

26
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:39,040
Princess.

27
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,079
Princess.

28
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:41,760
Yue.

29
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,760
Change clothes with the Princess.

30
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,879
I'll distract them.

31
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:45,719
Escape from here.

32
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:46,319
No.

33
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:47,719
Nan Xing, it's too dangerous.

34
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:49,319
They're no mere bandits.

35
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,120
They're after the Princess.

36
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,159
I will definitely come back for you.

37
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,719
Trust me.

38
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,480
Nan Xing.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,919
Over there, chase.

40
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,120
Princess.

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,639
I won't fail the mission.

42
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,199
Help.

43
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:57,520
Help.

44
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,319
Who are you?

45
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,199
Let go of me.

46
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,599
Let go of me.

47
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,000
(Prince Chen's Mansion, Yu State)
Put me down.

48
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,319
Let go of me.

49
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,560
What do you want?

50
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,759
What will you do?

51
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,599
Don't come over.

52
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,120
Don't come over.

53
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,000
I... I'm the Princess from Sheng State.

54
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:27,000
(Diplomatic Marriage Pact)
I have the document.

55
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,160
Princess.

56
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,360
Merely a castoff of Sheng State.

57
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:44,480
Your Highness,
I've something important to report.

58
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:47,759
Come in.

59
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,839
Your Highness.

60
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:54,439
There are some clues to
officials' private trade

61
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:55,319
with foreign tribes.

62
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,600
Got it.

63
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:01,160
Prepare some new clothes
for the Princess of Sheng State.

64
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,680
Princess of Sheng State?

65
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,199
Sure, I'll prepare it now.

66
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:14,519
(Your Highness?)

67
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:16,959
(He is a prince of Yu State.)

68
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,399
The diplomatic marriage
is a delay strategy.

69
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:21,959
If it fails,

70
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,360
the two states will fall into conflicts,

71
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:26,160
causing suffering to the mass.

72
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:28,959
Yu State has
a confidential military defense map.

73
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,560
With it,

74
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:32,920
you can contain Yu State.

75
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,199
You must

76
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,040
get it.

77
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:42,560
Princess.

78
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,360
Princess.

79
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:45,639
(Might there be defense map clues here?)

80
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:47,879
Miss,

81
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:48,759
I personally witnessed

82
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:50,319
Prince Chen brought back a woman.

83
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:52,000
Just in his room.

84
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,040
I want to see
what kind of woman has captured

85
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,439
the heart of my Ruheng.

86
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,879
(Such an important map)

87
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:02,879
(won't be somewhere easily found.)

88
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,120
(Wondering if Nan Xing is safe now.)

89
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:12,839
Who are you?

90
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:16,439
Kick her out.

91
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:19,319
Who's this wild girl?

92
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:21,439
How dare
you barge into Prince Chen's room.

93
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,240
Get out.

94
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,480
Let go of me.

95
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:25,920
Let go of me.

96
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,480
Throw her out.

97
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,120
Copy.

98
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:42,040
Crown Prince.

99
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:44,240
This wild girl was sneaking around

100
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,319
in Ruheng's room.

101
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:46,639
Not sure what she was up to.

102
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,839
She's surely a thief.

103
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,120
Your Highness.

104
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,680
I'm the Princess for diplomatic marriage
from Sheng.

105
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,279
For diplomatic marriage?

106
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:55,759
Any evidence?

107
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,439
Of course.

108
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:58,680
The diplomatic marriage pact.

109
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,279
(Oops.)

110
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,800
(That man took
the diplomatic marriage pact.)

111
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,160
You're obviously stalling.

112
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,160
Crown Prince.

113
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,680
The person is suspicious.

114
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,360
We'd better finish her now.
