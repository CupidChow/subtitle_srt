(Your Life is What Matters)

3
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:17,519
Your Highness.

4
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:20,280
When I went to the mass grave,

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,320
Nan Xing gave me

6
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,039
the defense map he replicated

7
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:23,879
before he died.

8
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:32,000
(This map matches my mother's exactly.)

9
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:38,079
(My mother promised to help me then.)

10
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:42,640
(Born to a military family,
she excelled in cartography.)

11
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,359
(After she passed away,)

12
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,280
(Crown Prince presented
the defense map,)

13
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,479
(earning the Emperor's trust.)

14
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,719
(He claimed
that this map was for my mother.)

15
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:52,600
(The, his intention was)

16
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:53,880
to murder,

17
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:55,600
seize the map,

18
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,439
and ascend to power.

19
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,799
Your Highness,
we've notified the Empress Dowager

20
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:07,439
to proceed.

21
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,719
Good.

22
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,280
Your Highness, Crown Prince
took Princess to Jinluan Hall.

23
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:15,400
His patience has run out.

24
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:20,000
Once the Emperor dies tonight,

25
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:21,519
tomorrow morning,

26
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,799
I will have all the ministers of Yu

27
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:25,400
welcome my ascent to the throne.

28
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,640
I intercepted

29
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,040
a letter of Chuyao from Miao.

30
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,239
Your Highness, what does the letter say?

31
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:35,640
The letter says

32
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:38,200
Crown Prince is colluding with Miao.

33
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,040
Once he ascends to power,

34
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:42,680
he will form alliance with Miao,
and wage wars on others.

35
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,159
Then, I will expose you as an enemy spy,

36
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:46,359
in the court.

37
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,560
That would give me ample reason
to attack Sheng.

38
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,040
Your Highness, what should we do?

39
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:55,000
Send a message to rescue Chuyao back.

40
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:57,959
We should go to see Empress Dowager now.

41
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:02,560
Chu Yifan.

42
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,239
How despicable and shameless.

43
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:08,319
I miss your sugar pills.

44
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,199
Isn't this the letter Chuyao sent to me?

45
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,280
How did it end up in your hands?

46
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,360
Sheng Yueling.

47
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,680
You are still of use to me now.

48
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:20,800
I've already rescued Chuyao.

49
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,719
Lord Wu is also willing to back me.

50
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,360
Now that my former men have reunited.

51
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:29,280
It's time for you to step back.

52
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:31,560
If you name Chu Ruheng

53
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,800
as surrendered to Sheng,

54
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,800
I'll make you my concubine.

55
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:37,319
Don't even think about it.

56
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,639
You've been lying low for years.

57
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,960
Turns out you've played a grand game.

58
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:49,439
Another one unaware of what's best.

59
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:51,800
Then I have no choice but to

60
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,199
slowly torture you.

61
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:58,000
So be it.

62
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:00,280
I am tired.

63
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,599
It's time to step back.

64
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,120
The sun is about to rise.

65
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,360
It's dawn.

66
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,840
The court officials will arrive soon.

67
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,000
Chu Ruheng.

68
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,080
Ruheng.

69
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,280
Why are you here?

70
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,280
Chu Yifan, stop this.

71
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,080
Stop this?

72
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,599
I've prepared for so long.

73
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,479
And now you tell me to stop?

74
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,520
I've handed over the evidence

75
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,960
of your plot to kill the Emperor

76
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,960
and seize power
to the Ministry of Justice.

77
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,280
Empress Dowager

78
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:05,240
finally chose you, huh?

79
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:08,960
Crown Prince.

80
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:11,240
I know you're not bad by nature.

81
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,080
Stop this.

82
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,079
Are you trying to make me just go

83
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,680
from nothing to nothing?

84
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,680
Let me tell you.

85
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,079
If I cannot ascend to the throne today,

86
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,639
none of you will survive.

87
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,600
Yue.

88
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,319
Don't move.

89
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,680
Or I'll kill her.

90
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:31,800
Let me ask you.

91
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,079
Did you kill my mother?

92
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,480
Exactly.

93
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:38,839
Then why?

94
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,879
You and I grew up together.

95
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,160
My mother treated you
like her own child.

96
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:45,439
Her own child?

97
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,160
Then do you remember how my mother died?

98
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,439
It's because Concubine Yu won all love,

99
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,120
leaving not a shred to my mother.

100
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:56,360
The two of us
suffered enough humiliation.

101
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,560
In the end, my mother
died of depression.

102
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:03,279
I poisoned both Concubine Yu
and Lord Hui.

103
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,680
Forgot to tell you.

104
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:08,360
The attack on the Princess of Sheng

105
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:10,959
was also orchestrated by me.

106
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:12,959
As long as she dies,

107
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,680
I will have the reason to propose a war,

108
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,279
and accelerate my alliance with Miao.

109
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,879
You're the one who killed Princess.

110
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:23,240
I'll kill you.

111
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:24,560
Don't move.

112
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,360
Yue.

113
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,079
Don't move.

114
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:27,639
Chu Yifan.

115
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,800
The person you want to kill is me.

116
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:30,879
Let her go.

117
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:33,279
I will do anything you ask, okay?

118
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You have displeased me greatly.

119
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:38,560
How could I let you off easily?

120
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,879
Do you want to save your Yue's life?

121
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,839
Kneel.

122
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:49,120
Kneel.

123
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,199
Fine, I'll kneel.

124
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:52,920
No.

125
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:07,879
No.

126
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:08,448
Pick it up.

127
00:06:08,448 --> 00:06:09,079
No.

128
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:10,720
Pick it up.

129
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,319
No.

130
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,240
No.

131
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:36,800
Do it.

132
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,319
No.

133
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:39,199
Ruheng, my death...

134
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,800
my death is of little significance.

135
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:42,759
Yue.

136
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,560
Your life is what matters.

137
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,800
Chu Ruheng.

138
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:51,600
Today, you'll die here.

139
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,399
No.

140
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:53,240
Do it.

141
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,439
Do it.

142
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:56,759
No.

143
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:00,160
Only knowing how to save others

144
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,959
won't save yourself.

145
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,600
You should learn to kill.

146
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,120
Do it.

147
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,519
Yue.

148
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:14,879
Yue.

149
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:28,439
Chu Yifan.

150
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,439
Stop fighting it.

151
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,399
Shut up.

152
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,079
Chu Ruheng, let me tell you.

153
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:35,959
My life,

154
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,480
my decision.

155
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:58,240
Oh, my mother.

156
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,360
Your son has finally
ascended to the throne.

157
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,240
From now on,

158
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,199
the world is mine.

159
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,399
Your son can protect you now.

160
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,399
It's all

161
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:26,560
mine.

162
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,279
Yue, we are safe now.

163
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:51,960
It's all over.

164
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:53,960
Yue.

165
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:56,200
Yue, what's wrong with you?

166
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,120
Yue.

167
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,159
Yue.

168
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,039
Yue.

169
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,240
Yue.

170
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,080
Yue.

171
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:06,879
Yue.

172

(Crown Prince Chu Yifan)

174
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,960
(plotted the murder of Concubine Yu,
harmed the loyal and good,)

175
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,840
(and schemed for power.)

176
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,720
(His title of Crown Prince
is abolished.)

177
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,480
(Prince Chen's service
in saving the Emperor was meritorious.)

178
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:33,399
(He is named Crown Prince.)

179
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,159
(Yu and Sheng
have formed a friendly alliance.)

180
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,200
