(Her Choice)

3
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,839
Your Highness.

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,640
Prince or commoner,
the law should punish both equally.

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,839
Prince Chen is the prime suspect
for killing Lord Hui.

6
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,879
He should be put in the dungeon
for interrogation.

7
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,560
Brother, no concern.

8
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,200
Yu's laws are clear and strict.

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,960
Handle it accordingly.

10
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:40,840
Your Highness,
please issue the judgment.

11
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,159
It remains to be investigated.

12
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:46,960
A prince is involved.

13
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:48,920
It's about the dignity
of Yu's royal family.

14
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,320
Confine him to his residence now.

15
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:00,240
Yue.

16
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:01,840
I've got good news.

17
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,799
Same here.

18
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:05,159
- I found the map.
- Chu Ruheng is confined for murder.

19
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,560
This is the military defense map.

20
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:20,760
Chu Ruheng has no time to mind us now.

21
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,680
Map in hand, let's hurry to leave here.

22
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,599
I also heard

23
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,079
Yu's Ministry of Justice
employs ruthless tactics.

24
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,239
If the murder is confirmed,

25
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,439
though a prince,

26
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:31,599
he's got a lot to suffer.

27
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:34,920
Yue.

28
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:37,319
Yue.

29
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,400
Why don't you

30
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,799
look happy at all?

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,280
I... I am happy.

32
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,599
Then that's great.

33
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:46,680
Pack your luggage quickly.

34
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,599
We'll leave now.

35
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:51,640
Pack the luggage.

36
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,879
(What exactly caused Lord Hui's death?)

37
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:08,439
(Why such coincidental timing?)

38
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,960
(Who's the true culprit?)

39
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:26,479
Been a while since you last read, right?

40
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:33,240
This is the military defense map
drawn by Mother.

41
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,639
Who's there?

42
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:38,360
I've brought food for Prince Chen.

43
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:40,800
I have the Crown Prince's order.

44
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:49,919
How's the investigation
into Lord Hui's death?

45
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:51,680
For now,

46
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,759
no clues have been found at the scene.

47
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,879
Your Highness.

48
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,919
(Down the mother and teacher killer)
Rumors are all over.

49
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,719
Detrimental.

50
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:12,120
If Junior Minister of Justice

51
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,599
takes Your Highness away,

52
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,439
there may be no foothold

53
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,639
for Your Highness in this palace.

54
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,080
What should we do then?

55
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,599
Take this letter to Empress Dowager.

56
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:26,240
Copy.

57
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,879
Right, where is Princess Chen?

58
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,879
I didn't notice.

59
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:34,280
Such a big issue occurred.

60
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,479
Yet, there's no trace of her.

61
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,599
Perhaps,

62
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,719
she knew Your Highness was in danger,

63
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,479
and fled to avoid getting involved.

64
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,319
A waste of

65
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,120
the sincerity in giving her the hairpin.

66
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:47,000
Fled?

67
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,080
Lufeng, you trust me?

68
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,680
Of course I do.

69
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,439
I also trust one person.

70
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,360
I didn't trust fate before.

71
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,719
But some arrangements of fate

72
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,199
gradually made me a believer of it.

73
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,719
Certain things and people

74
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,280
are simply destined.

75
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:14,719
Well,

76
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,800
being destined

77
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,240
still requires sincerity to affirm it.

78
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,680
My mother's hairpin,
for her daughter-in-law.

79
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,360
Thorns are everywhere in this palace.

80
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,240
A little carelessness.

81
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,480
These thorns may take your life.

82
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:52,319
Yue.

83
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,920
Yu State has

84
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,360
a confidential military defense map.

85
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,720
With it,

86
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,160
you can contain Yu State.

87
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,439
Yue, let's hurry.

88
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,279
I am thinking...

89
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,560
Nan Xing, we can't just leave like this.

90
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:21,120
Why not?

91
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,959
Meticulous as Chu Ruheng is.

92
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,639
He'd never kill the Lord
in broad daylight.

93
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,040
There's something in it.

94
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:29,720
Why care about him?

95
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,879
Our mission is the map.

96
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:32,439
Now that we have it.

97
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:33,360
With cracked defenses,

98
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,639
Yu will fail.

99
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:35,759
But we haven't verified

100
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,199
its authenticity.

101
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,480
Leave rashly like this.

102
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,600
If this sparks a war,

103
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,879
outcomes are devastating.

104
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:43,160
Upon verifying its authenticity,

105
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,480
we can then leave.

106
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,279
Are you sure

107
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,000
isn't it because of Chu Ruheng?

108
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,120
Nan Xing, trust me.

109
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,360
After we've got all straight,

110
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,360
we'll leave.

111
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,399
Yue.

112
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,079
Yue.

113
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,519
The news says
that Lord Hui died suddenly.

114
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,079
The coroner did a silver needle test.

115
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:32,920
No signs of poisoning.

116
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:35,399
Chu Ruheng was the only one
present at the time.

117
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,079
He's the prime suspect.

118
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,160
Why is there strange floral scent

119
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,199
with no flowers around?

120
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:58,600
(Fragrance of blossoming iris.)

121
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:12,519
Mengding tribute tea.

122
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:44,319
What do you want?

123
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:47,639
Today, I represent Yu State

124
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,160
to remove you, the spy.

125
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,600
Miss Qin.

126
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,600
Assassinate the current Princess of Yu,

127
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,000
Princess of Sheng for alliance.

128
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,800
You've got nerve.

129
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,480
A pair of spies.

130
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,680
Do it. See what happens.

131
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,560
Miss Qin's life is more valuable.

132
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:02,959
A life for a life.

133
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,040
I win.

134
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,680
You.

135
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,360
Stop messing around.

136
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,920
Nan Xing, let's go.

137
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:16,959
Let's go.

138
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,600
What?

139
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,439
Now, Ruheng

140
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,839
is caught up in the charge
of killing Lord Hui.

141
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:30,199
He's confined to his residence.

142
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:33,440
As I see,
these all have something to do with her.

143
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:34,399
That woman

144
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,440
put Ruheng in danger.

145
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,759
Such a cunning woman.

146
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,799
Princess, be more careful henceforth.

147
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:44,200
Since I was born,

148
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,639
I never need to be careful.

149
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,440
I'm going to the Empress Dowager
to save Ruheng.

150
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:50,720
Princess Chuyao.

151
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,720
Miss, clever strategy.

152
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,759
Kill two birds with one arrow.

153
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,279
With Empress Dowager,

154
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,200
Prince Chen will be saved.

155
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,200
With Chuyao

156
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm afraid
that Sheng Yueling is going to suffer.

157
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:12,080
I must save Prince Chen.

158
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,879
As for Sheng Yueling,

159
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:17,080
I'll have her rather die.

160
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:33,080
Your Highness, the persons
of Justice Ministry are here.

161
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,639
Why panic?

162
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,559
Your Highness.

163
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,960
I have a confession

164
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,000
from Lord King's personal servant.

165
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,720
Please come with me, Your Highness.

166
00:09:58,279 --> 00:09:59,080
