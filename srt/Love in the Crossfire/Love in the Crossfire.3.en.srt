=Episode 3=
(Echo of Greedy Joy)

3
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:19,640
So hot.

4
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:32,520
Have a good dream.

5
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:08,599
(What happened last night?)

6
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,319
(Why is he watching me
even during my sleep?)

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,519
(I won't be suspected, am I?)

8
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,560
Princess.

9
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:48,760
Where are you going?

10
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:56,159
Princess.

11
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:59,120
Already forget what happened last night?

12
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,280
I was drunk last night.

13
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:02,840
I don't remember anything.

14
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,400
Seems like Princess' tolerance

15
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,640
is just one cup.

16
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:06,760
I...

17
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,360
(Why can't I remember anything
from last night?)

18
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,639
Next time, before adding drugs,

19
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:15,039
check if there's anything else in it.

20
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:16,680
Don't lose your body first.

21
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,120
What do you mean?

22
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:22,000
Lufeng.

23
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,639
Here.

24
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:25,520
Arrange another room for Princess.

25
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,599
Copy.

26
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,919
Your Highness.

27
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:29,439
This way, please.

28
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,319
Your Highness.

29
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,479
Missing that girl again?

30
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,759
How is the investigation going?

31
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,199
Apart from the deceased,

32
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:10,199
this list has all

33
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:12,240
who interacted with Concubine Yu.
Any informant?

34
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,719
(Zhang Yanqing, Minister of Finance)
Individual check is required to see

35
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,080
if any of them know anything.

36
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,319
By the way,

37
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:21,680
the bandits robbing the marriage envoys

38
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,719
are suspicious.

39
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:24,479
Investigate this as well.

40
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,599
Understood.

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,960
Perhaps someone intends to exploit
this diplomatic marriage

42
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:33,879
to stir up disputes
between Yu and Sheng again?

43
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:37,280
Your Highness.

44
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,280
This marriage princess from Sheng

45
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,599
encountered bandits on the way,

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,639
yet escaped unharmed.

47
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:45,439
It is suspicious. We should be careful.

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,360
You go to Sheng State personally,

49
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:51,800
to secretly investigate
this Sheng Yueling.

50
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:53,560
Copy.

51
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:55,879
One more thing.

52
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,199
There's rumor that

53
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:58,360
an assassin came from Sheng.

54
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:00,680
Crown Prince is sending covert agents
to probe.

55
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,840
Join me for a play later.

56
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,800
A play?

57
00:04:13,427 --> 00:04:15,648
(Overflow well floods stove;
Unfilial son isn't spared.)

58
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,920
(The defense map is Yu's vital secret.)

59
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:25,560
(Not likely in this cold
Prince Chen's mansion.)

60
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,600
Your Highness, rumors go that these days

61
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,279
assassins and spies are in the palace.

62
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:33,199
People are mixed in the palace.

63
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:34,959
Keep a close eye on the map here.

64
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:35,879
Got it.

65
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,199
Might the defense map be here?

66
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,680
Your Highness, Princess left.

67
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:51,720
Let her go.

68
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,279
Your Highness, are you testing Princess

69
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:58,399
or protecting Princess?

70
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:04,160
On the night of their wedding,
she still got the love.

71
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,639
How?

72
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:07,399
I am useless.

73
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:10,600
But I did have placed the sleeping drug

74
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,720
in the wedding cup.

75
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,879
I'm unsure why

76
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:16,160
Lufeng says he heard at the doorstep

77
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,720
that the princess of Sheng
lost her virginity.

78
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:22,399
Miss, please calm down.

79
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:24,160
It's all my fault.

80
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,839
I thought

81
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:30,839
if Ruheng bears the name
of an unfilial son,

82
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,120
nobody else would compete for him.

83
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,399
Unexpectedly, a princess arrived
for marriage alliance!

84
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:38,360
Perhaps we

85
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:42,199
could go and visit the Crown Prince.

86
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,600
Right.

87
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,199
The imperial reign is now vested
in the Crown Prince.

88
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:52,360
This marriage alliance

89
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,040
must also have been agreed to by him.

90
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:56,519
Crown Prince.

91
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,279
What exactly

92
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:01,480
are you planning?

93
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,199
Yue.

94
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:35,360
Go, now.

95
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,560
Nan Xing.

96
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:46,879
Nan Xing.

97
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,879
Are you injured?

98
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,560
Are you injured?

99
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:52,639
I'm fine.

100
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:54,920
Sorry for making you worried.

101
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:57,680
How did you know I'm here?

102
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:59,079
After distracting the bandits,

103
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:00,399
I've been searching for you.

104
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,879
Later I heard

105
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,560
Prince Chen of Yu and
Princess of Sheng were married.

106
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:06,639
I risked coming here to see.

107
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,279
Yue.

108
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,720
Is Prince Chen nice to you?

109
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,560
Prince Chen has a strange temperament.

110
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,600
Inscrutable.

111
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,759
Look at this.

112
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:28,160
Overflowing well quenches stove.

113
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:29,879
Unfilial son isn't spared.

114
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:30,639
This is?

115
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,079
I heard it in the city

116
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:33,519
Prince Chen, Chu Ruheng,

117
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,439
angered his mother Concubine Yu
to death.

118
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:38,439
This Concubine Yu
was the Emperor's most beloved one.

119
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,600
It is said that Chu Ruheng

120
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,600
was most likely to be the Crown Prince.

121
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:45,720
Ever since Concubine Yu died,

122
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:46,959
rumor has it

123
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,439
that Chu Ruheng becomes Yu's
top unfilial son since its inception.

124
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,240
The Emperor neglects him ever since.

125
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:00,399
Later, the eldest son

126
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:04,120
Chu Yifan, was made the Crown Prince.

127
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:06,720
No wonder it's so desolate here.

128
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,399
This Chu Ruheng
is so brutal and defiant.

129
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:12,079
After we get the defense map,

130
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:14,160
we will leave this place immediately.

131
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,279
But any news

132
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,000
about this defense map?

133
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:25,519
It is very likely to be here.

134
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:26,279
Here?

135
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:33,559
The defense map is the top secret of Yu.

136
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,960
Here? It makes no sense.

137
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,679
Today

138
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,120
I overheard Chu Ruheng
speaking with his subordinate.

139
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:41,639
He said,
'Keep a close eye on the map here'.

140
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:45,279
Though not definitively the defense map,

141
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,159
we must look into it on our own.
