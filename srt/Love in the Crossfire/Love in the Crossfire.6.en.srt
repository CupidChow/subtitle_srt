(Your Candy Belongs to Me Alone)

3
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,960
Your Highness, if you feel pain,

4
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:31,920
you may take a sugar pill I made.

5
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,920
It soothes pain and calms the mind.

6
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:53,799
Well done, Fan, take this candy.

7
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:55,359
Then you won't feel bitter.

8
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,240
Your Highness.

9
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,320
Your Highness.

10
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,280
Thank you, Princess Chen.

11
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:09,760
Half of the time has passed.

12
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,920
Princess, please administer acupuncture.

13
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,879
Do not delay.

14
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,840
Anything urgent back home?

15
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,120
Your Highness, if you're in a hurry,

16
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,400
you may go back first.

17
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,719
Very well.

18
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,599
Then, please take good care
of His Highness.

19
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,680
I'll leave first.

20
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:39,719
(He actually left. Unpredictable man.)

21
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,359
(But this is great; no one's watching.)

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,840
(Wondering
how Nan Xing's investigation goes.)

23
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:56,680
(Several rooms searched; nothing found.)

24
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,359
(The defense map is indeed well placed.)

25
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:01,959
I didn't expect

26
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,920
that you have
such exquisite medical skills.

27
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,920
I'm feeling much better now.

28
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,400
Your Highness, have more rest.

29
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,039
I'll call the Imperial Physician.

30
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:11,960
Good.

31
00:02:26,323 --> 00:02:28,096
(Chongwen Hall of Eastern Palace)

32
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:34,520
Where's Nan Xing gone?

33
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,479
Guard Xiao, Crown Prince summons you.

34
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,360
Coming.

35
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,039
You...

36
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,639
Your candy belongs to me alone.

37
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:39,439
Is it sweet?

38
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,160
Your Highness.

39
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,560
We've checked
the identity of the Princess.

40
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:01,160
Does this Sheng Yueling know medicine?

41
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,879
Based on my findings,

42
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,839
she has never learned medicine.

43
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,519
However,

44
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,519
she is often unwell.

45
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,319
A female physician
always accompanies her.

46
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,879
It must be her.

47
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,600
Chu Ruheng asked me to the garden.

48
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,319
Could it still be about
that last incident?

49
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,920
Is it a conspiracy?

50
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:42,560
I merit death.

51
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,040
I will clean it up immediately.

52
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,879
(Princess' Residence)
Wounded, it hurts, doesn't it?

53
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,720
Don't move.

54
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,000
Otherwise, the wounds will hurt badly.

55
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,839
Please spare my life.

56
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:58,920
Your Highness, please.

57
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,680
I dare not again.

58
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,800
An adult should not cry.

59
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,959
I'll stitch your wounds.

60
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:04,879
I dare not again.

61
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:06,040
Your Highness, spare my life.

62
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,199
Your Highness, please.

63
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:08,800
I dare not again.

64
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,120
Be quiet, Chuyao.

65
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,199
Muyi.

66
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:16,240
Muyi, what brings you here?

67
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:17,959
I heard you're back

68
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:19,439
with Empress Dowager. I should come.

69
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:21,800
Did you enjoy yourself this time?

70
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,120
Yes, I did.

71
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,920
But I didn't expect that upon my return,

72
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,839
Ruheng has wed.

73
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:30,279
You seem well-informed.

74
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,120
This woman from Sheng is said

75
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,120
all over the palace

76
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,800
to be a spy sent by Sheng.

77
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,839
Mother.

78
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:48,560
I've found the person who saved me.

79
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:51,040
But she doesn't remember me.

80
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,360
Do you think,

81
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,040
I should return the item

82
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,720
in the box back to her?
