Enough, enough, stop.

4
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,120
Spit it out.

5
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,000
Is the one in this portrait

6
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,920
the real Princess of Sheng?

7
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,359
What portrait?

8
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,560
I've never even seen it.

9
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,000
Still being stubborn.

10
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,079
Your Majesty.

11
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,520
Why not just kill this spy?

12
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,200
Your Majesty.

13
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:49,520
I suffered such humiliation
because of her.

14
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,399
You must stand up for me.

15
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:55,280
Keep beating her

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,359
until she confesses.

17
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,119

I created this drawing.

I and Princess of Sheng

23
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:41,799
once had a brief encounter.

24
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,599
But she was wearing a veil.

25
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:48,159
I sketched her looks from a guess.

26
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:51,239
The resemblance isn't always precise.

27
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,439
But she is indeed Princess of Sheng
whom I am to marry.

28
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,519
Your Majesty, don't listen to him.

to investigate this Sheng Yueling.

63
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,759
Copy.

64
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,279
Thanks to the help of Yu State,

65
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,360
Miao can then transport
rare and exotic herbs abroad.

66
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,839
Such abundant yields!

67
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,600
Keep the transaction list confidential.

68
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,680
Of course.

69
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,519
These are just minor transactions.

70
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,680
Our future alliance in battles

71
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:32,920
would be big.

72
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:42,879
Nan Xing.

73
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:44,240
I am well now.

74
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:46,199
No need to send me tonic soups daily.

75
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,399
Yue.

76
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:50,959
It's all my fault.

77
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,928
I shouldn't have shown it.

78
00:05:52,928 --> 00:05:53,639
If I wasn't...

79
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:54,680
It's not your fault.

80
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,199
It's just that

81
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:58,800
we should be more careful.

82
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,279
Suspend the search for the map,

83
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:01,759
to avoid arousing suspicion.

84
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:14,720
Your Highness,
your condition is now stable.

85
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:16,519
From now on, follow my prescription.

86
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:17,800
Take the medicine on time.

87
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,839
No need for me to come over anymore.

88
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:23,079
Alright.

89
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,279
Thank you, Princess Chen.

90
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,800
I didn't expect

91
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:30,319
that you had met Ruheng before.

92
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:34,519
Fate decides it all.

93
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:38,439
It's a pity

94
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,160
that I don't have such fate.

95
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:46,480
That said,

96
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,040
how would Princess of Sheng

97
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,519
be in such a war-torn borderland?

98
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,720
Very intriguing.

99
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,360
Crown Prince, I have been frail
since childhood.

100
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,040
I went there
just to seek medical treatment.

101
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:01,439
Your Highness, it's getting late.

102
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:03,160
No need to escort me further.

103
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:05,120
I'll take my leave now.

104
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:07,160
Alright.

105
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,839
See you.

106
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,439
(I've been studying iris oil
these days.)

107
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,279
(I've also taken on the scent.)

108
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,720
You...

109
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:37,800
The beauty's fragrance wafts.

110
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:39,959
Makes me feel all the more fond.

111
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:41,000
Who are you?

112
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:43,480
I'm a distinguished guest of Yu State.

113
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,240
The heir of Miao.

114
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:46,759
(It's him.)

115
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,759
There's a saying in your Central Plains.

116
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:51,879
A woman is what she wears.

117
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,600
This beauty
is truly like exquisite brocade.

118
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,920
Dazzling and splendid.

119
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:00,759
How about you come back to Miao with me?

120
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,279
You...

121
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:16,399
This time it's your clothes cut open.

122
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:18,720
Next time it might be your neck.

123
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,680
My clothes.

124
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,040
Just wait.

125
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,039
I've searched through
the emissary's room.

126
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:36,399
No sight of the register you mentioned.

127
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,120
Register?

128
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,840
This register

129
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,879
relates to

130
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:43,360
secret dealings between Yu and Miao.

131
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,320
Presumably, they'll guard it strictly.

132
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,159
Do you suspect the iris

133
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:50,879
is from the emissary of Miao?

134
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,399
Upon confirming
it is iris' poison last time,

135
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:58,919
I had Lufeng investigate.

136
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:00,799
Miao's iris is managed

137
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:02,879
and traded sorely
by Miao's royal family.

138
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:03,879
They are registered.

139
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:06,279
This time, Alanxiu came,

140
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,559
with the register.

141
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,919
I suspect

142
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:10,399
the transaction records of iris

143
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,200
should be noted on it.

144
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,159
Then, would he carry it with him?

145
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:15,080
Very likely.

146
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,399
So during this period,

147
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:19,159
we should be more careful.

148
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:24,360
In the next few days,

149
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:25,960
just stay in your room.

150
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,039
Wait for your return.

151
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:41,960
Your Highness, one moment please.

152
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:46,679
What would you like, two beauties?

153
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,559
Tonight, I have no company.

154
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:52,039
How about you two accompany me?

155
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:54,919
Your Highness must be jesting.

156
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:57,879
If anyone should accompany you,
it should be Prince Chen.

157
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:00,480
Visiting foreign emissaries

158
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,639
should be treated
with the highest etiquette in Yu.

159
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:05,679
Today, Prince Chen
humiliated Your Highness.

160
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:08,000
If word gets out,
it might be a laughingstock.

161
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,000
This Prince Chen is just a princess
for marriage alliance.

162
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,080
Even if she were given to you,

163
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,360
it is sensible, isn't it?

164
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:19,000
I will definitely get what I want.

165
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,759
What about Your Highness?

166
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:27,360
Prince Chen is truly a fine garment.

167
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:29,080
I want her.

168
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,240
We just happen to have a plan.

169
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:47,960
Interesting.

170
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:51,679
