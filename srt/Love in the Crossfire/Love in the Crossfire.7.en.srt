=Episode 7=
(Hairpin As Token of Affection)

3
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:19,640
Your Highness, you want me?

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,120
Come here.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,799
Sit.

6
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,719
Turn around.

7
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:46,959
Don't move.

8
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,120
Your Highness, this is...

9
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,360
My mother's hairpin,
for her daughter-in-law.

10
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,840
It's yours now.

11
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,159
Your Highness.

12
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:32,879
That hairpin from Concubine Yu,

13
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,280
you gave it to Princess Chen?

14
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,759
That hairpin

15
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:37,960
was left for her daughter-in-law.

16
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,080
Sheng Yueling is my wife.

17
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,639
So she should have it.

18
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,680
The girl who saved you before.

19
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:45,439
Aren't you still thinking about her?

20
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,919
Is Your Highness painting this girl?

21
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:57,759
Check out those sparkling eyes!

22
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,639
(Chu Ruheng is into someone.)

23
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:01,520
Why does she look so familiar?

24
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,919
Princess, eavesdropping isn't polite.

25
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:07,960
Come in.

26
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:15,960
Your Highness.

27
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,840
Princess, what brings you here?

28
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:23,400
I've brought some pastries for you.

29
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,960
What are you painting?

30
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:32,000
No need to bother.

31
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,919
Okay, I'll leave.

32
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,560
Your Highness's calligraphy
is more vigorous and forceful.

33
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,800
I'm truly aged.

34
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,120
Writing is becoming harder.

35
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:18,319
Today

36
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,560
I may not be able to finish it.

37
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,959
You're being honest.

38
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,240
Everyone knows that Lord Hui

39
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,079
embodies vigor, integrity, and talent.

40
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:27,439
When the Emperor established the laws,

41
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:29,680
you were the primary contributor.

42
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,800
Not in the least.

43
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,279
You well deserve the title

44
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:33,680
of Lord Enforcer.

45
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:35,079
To me,

46
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:37,240
you are a friend and a mentor.

47
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,120
Lucky me!

48
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,079
Your Highness.

49
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:46,120
Miss Qin sent you these pastries.

50
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,959
They're yours now.

51
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,720
Your Highness.

52
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,920
We found something
about Concubine Yu's case.

53
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,040
It's said that
the day before Concubine Yu died,

54
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:57,759
Lord Hui paid a visit.

55
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:00,120
Lord Hui?

56
00:05:02,163 --> 00:05:03,520
(Chunhui Garden)

57
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,839
Ever since he gave me the hairpin,

58
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,000
Chu Ruheng even allowed me

59
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,360
unrestricted access to the garden.

60
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,319
Would he have set traps here?

61
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,399
My Lord.

62
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,839
Your Highness.

63
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:28,759
Junior Minister.

64
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:32,120
Your Highness, anything urgent?

65
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:41,759
My Lord.

66
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,519
I heard that before my mother's death,

67
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,160
you visited her.

68
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:57,879
It's hard to state.

69
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,079
Heng.

70
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:01,120
Strong enforcers fortify the nation.

71
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:03,600
Weak enforcers weaken the nation.

72
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:04,639
My Lord.

73
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,879
In youth, you were just and lawful,

74
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,279
earning court respect.

75
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,160
and rectifying global injustices.

76
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,519
You are the revered
Lord Enforcer of Yu State.

77
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,639
Shame on me.

78
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,600
My mother's death
is rife with suspicion.

79
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,759
Her soul can't find peace in heaven.

80
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:34,600
Are you still that Lord Enforcer?

81
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:36,959
My Lord.

82
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:43,319
Alright.

83
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,879
My life is nearing its end.

84
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:50,360
It's just I had my kid late in life.

85
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,639
I implore Your Highness
to keep my family safe.

86
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,279
Concubine Yu, sorry for the offense.

87
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,800
Back then,

88
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:12,120
you declined your mother's aid

89
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:14,480
to take the role of crown prince.

90
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,480
You huffed off to the borderlands,

91
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:18,879
and quelled the unrest in Miao Region.

92
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:20,279
Secret compartment.

93
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,519
After you left,

94
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:27,560
your mother collapsed, vomiting blood.

95
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,160
Prior to your return,

96
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:31,879
she passed away.

97
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,600
People say

98
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:36,480
you angered your mother to death.

99
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:39,040
But the truth is,

100
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,639
someone stolen...

101
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,680
My Lord. My Lord.

102
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,560
My Lord. My Lord.

103
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,279
The military defense map.

104
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,199
