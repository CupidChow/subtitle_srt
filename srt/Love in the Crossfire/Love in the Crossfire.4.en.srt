(Brought a Man Home)

3
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,600
Oh no.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,800
Come.

5
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:42,079
Your Highness,
what brings you here so late at night?

6
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,719
Not welcome?

7
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,000
Wouldn't dare.

8
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,520
Guards in the mansion report

9
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:49,159
they spotted a suspicious person.

10
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,840
For your safety,

11
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,479
as your husband,
I naturally should come and check.

12
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,159
Your Highness, look,

13
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,280
I am quite well here.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,840
It's late.

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,359
return and rest early, Your Highness.

16
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,359
Fine.

17
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,600
Since you're well,
I'll take my leave now.

18
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:28,359
Only a few days.

19
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:30,079
Already brought a man home.

20
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,599
It's not what you think.

21
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:34,000
He's the escort guard
assigned to protect me.

22
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:35,239
Escort?

23
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:37,000
Into the hands of bandits?

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,719
You...

25
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:39,120
The bandits were chasing us.

26
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,760
Nan Xing risked his life to divert them.

27
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,079
Otherwise, I'd have died
under the bandits' blades.

28
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:46,079
I ask Your Highness
to let Nan Xing stay.

29
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,640
What if I do not?

30
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,200
Princess.

31
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,840
Should Your Highness
kill my state citizen,

32
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,359
then kill me first.

33
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,400
From this moment,

34
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,560
Nan Xing is appointed
as Princess' personal guard.

35
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:24,800
If anything happens to Princess,

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,639
I will hold you accountable.

37
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,719
I will protect Princess at all costs.

38
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,080
Muyi, thank you for this.

39
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,439
This Mengding tribute tea
is indeed refreshing.

40
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,719
Together with your pastries,

41
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,000
it is such a delight.

42
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:02,840
Like you,

43
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:04,280
Concubine Yu

44
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,000
also loved pastries I make.

45
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:08,159
It's just a pity.

46
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:12,400
Yes, indeed.

47
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:15,879
Please try some.

48
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,439
Muyi, you're here today,

49
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,919
anything important?

50
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:28,199
Crown Prince.

51
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:30,199
One thing bothers me.

52
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:33,960
Why betroth that princess from Sheng

53
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,599
to Ruheng?

54
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,400
Back then,

55
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,960
Ruheng asked you to send me

56
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,520
the bracelet as token of affection,

57
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:44,800
saying when it's time,

58
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:46,719
he would propose to me.

59
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:47,919
But now...

60
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:48,840
Muyi.

61
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,319
Don't worry.

62
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:52,280
Ruheng marrying her

63
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,560
is simply a temporary measure
to delay warfare.

64
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,280
I guess

65
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:58,800
this princess of Sheng

66
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,280
could very well be a spy.

67
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:02,319
I must keep a close watch on her.

68
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:08,672
(Study Room, Prince Hui's Mansion)

69
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,639
Princess Hui and the young prince
are asleep?

70
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,639
Yes, they are.

71
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,759
Oh, Heng.

72
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,600
Haven't seen you for days.
You look worn.

73
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,240
Any worries on your mind?

74
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,600
My mother's death remains a mystery.

75
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,439
Behind this fog,

76
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,079
there seems to be a pair of hands,
elusive and obscure,

77
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,079
manipulating all.

78
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,959
Heng, once we hit the bottom
of the mountain, a path will show up.

79
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,480
With your intelligence,

80
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,240
it won't take long

81
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:44,399
to find the key.

82
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,040
Everything will become clear.

83
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,240
Been a while since you last read, right?

84
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:50,600
This book

85
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:54,079
was your late mother's favorite.

86
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:56,480
It contains refined details.

87
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,240
Read carefully.

88
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,720
Yue.

89
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,360
Chu Ruheng left the house.

90
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,759
I've fulfilled the marriage mission.

91
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:18,920
But far from enough.

92
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,360
Only by getting the map
and returning to Sheng,

93
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,120
can we fulfill Princess' entrustment.

94
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:26,000
But where is this defense map?

95
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:27,560
We're still in the dark.

96
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:29,000
Before you came,

97
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:32,680
I've searched all the key rooms

98
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,959
Chu Ruheng often stays.

99
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,720
But no defense map.

100
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,759
All drawn by you?

101
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,920
This morning, I toured the mansion,

102
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,120
and drew it on the fly.

103
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,639
Nan Xing, you have a photographic memory
since young.

104
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,720
This map simplifies our search.

105
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,279
I've already searched

106
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,480
most of these places.

107
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,720
Here lies a secluded courtyard.

108
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,720
I didn't even know it.

109
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:10,279
It's remote

110
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:11,560
and heavily guarded.

111
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,560
We must find some way.

112
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,360
Chase!

113
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:20,960
Go!

114
00:06:27,091 --> 00:06:29,680
(Chunhui Garden)

115
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,600
Miss, she's in the garden.

116
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,879
Ruheng

117
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,079
never allows outsiders
get in that place.

118
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,439
Sheng Yueling, how dare you set foot
in this forbidden area.

119
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:41,720
It'll be tough for you tonight.

120
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:03,199
This is the place

121
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,800
where Chu Ruheng worships his mother.

122
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:08,800
It's said that his mother
died of anger due to him.

123
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,519
Yet such a disobedient and unfilial son

124
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,800
decorated this place so solemnly.

125
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:26,519
(Could the military defense map
be behind this portrait?)

126
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,360
