Save Ruheng!

36
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:50,240
Ruheng?

37
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,400
Princess Chuyao plans to kill him.

38
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,960
Why would Chuyao kill Ruheng?

39
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,159
Ridiculous.

40
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:57,560
It's not safe here.

41
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,800
Leave.

42
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,639
No.

43
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,879
Live together,

44
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:02,199
or die together.

45
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:04,039
Not only Ruheng.

46
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:05,759
She also wants to kill that princess

47
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:06,639
from Sheng.

48
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,599
What?

49
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,199
Don't you fear the pursuers?

50
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,199
Not that as losing you.

51
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,319
Alright.

52
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:15,840
We must all live.

53
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:17,920
And live well.

54
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,879
Crown Prince, hurry and save them.

55
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:21,120
Or it will be too late.

56
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,160
Let's go.

57
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,839
Go.

58
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:27,079
Come.

59
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,120
It's all my fault.

60
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:46,879
I made you suffer this calamity.

61
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:50,319
Chu Ruheng.

62
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,560
Am I worth risking your life for?

63
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,600
Of course.

64
00:04:59,160 --> 00:04:59,959
Because

65
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:09,439
I like you.

66
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:14,199
Do you have feelings for me?

67
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:20,519
But haven't you always

68
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:22,360
had another girl in your heart?

69
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:23,720
Is it possible

70
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,839
that you are the girl?

71
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,839
I?

72
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,480
Have we met?

73
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,839
I once quelled turmoil
at the Miao-Yu border.

74
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,439
During that time,

75
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:51,720
I was luckily saved by someone
in the refugee camp.

76
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,519
Does this ring a bell?

77
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:14,800
So, from the very beginning,

78
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,680
you already knew

79
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:20,279
that I'm not the real princess.

80
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,360
Yes.

81
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:30,040
Can you tell me your real name?

82
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,160
My name is

83
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,040
Yue.

84
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:45,639
Yue.

85
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,399
Yue.

86
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,000
Yue.

87
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:58,480
Yue.

88
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,199
Chu Ruheng. Chu Ruheng.

89
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:03,319
Chu Ruheng.

90
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:21,360
A spy. A traitor.

91
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:24,959
If you don't find them tonight,

92
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:27,079
you're all dead.

93
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,160
Copy.

94
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:31,120
I didn't expect
that our innocent Princess Chuyao

95
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:32,759
has two faces.

96
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,680
Crown Prince, how come you are here?

97
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:48,879
Crown Prince?

98
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:51,439
Why don't you kneel upon my arrival?

99
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,079
Kneel?

100
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,560
You're joking.

101
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,439
I only kneel to the Emperor
and the Empress Dowager.

102
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,879
A sick son of an out-of-favor concubine
who was raised up by others.

103
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:04,079
Never expect me to kneel.

104
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:05,079
How reckless!

105
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:10,519
Princess Chuyao speaks disrespectfully,

106
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:12,079
insulting the Crown Prince.

107
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:14,319
Take her down.

108
00:08:14,944 --> 00:08:15,560
You...

109
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,560
You dare touch me.

110
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,120
Who do you think you are?
I wouldn't dare touch you?

111
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,720
Turn to Empress Dowager?

112
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,160
Or Empress Dowager instructed you?

113
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,439
How dare you defame Empress Dowager!

114
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:34,440
You are merely a puppet.

115
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,279
Aren't you as well?

116
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:40,960
You...

117
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:42,960
Take her off.

118
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,759
Copy.

119
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:48,519
Your Majesty, I'm innocent.
I have evidence.

120
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:50,039
Here's a portrait of Sheng's Princess.

121
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:51,320
She's clearly different

122
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,600
from the current Sheng Yueling.

123
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,000
What do you want?

124
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,519
Why?

125
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,159
Go.

126
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:08,799
Let go of me.

127
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:09,480
How dare you.

128
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,360
Let go of me.

129
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,919
