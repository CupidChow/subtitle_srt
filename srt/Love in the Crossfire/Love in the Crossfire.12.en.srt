=Episode 12=
(Fear Not. I'm Here.)

3
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,160
You were invited here.

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,800
But you suffered such humiliation.

5
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:26,079
It's my fault.

6
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,399
It's not.

7
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,560
If I'd met you earlier,

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,000
I might have lived differently.

9
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:39,679
I mean,

10
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:41,200
if I'd met you earlier,

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,560
I could've recovered long ago.

12
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,560
Thank you for the care, Your Highness.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,159
I'm taking her home.

14
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,480
(If Your Highness feels pain,)

15
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,159
(take a sugar pill I made.)

16
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:19,120
Indeed.

17
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,680
Pain is perpetual.

18
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:25,400
Joy as sweet as a sugar pill

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
is fleeting.

20
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,120
Your Highness.

21
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:55,959
Put me down, please.

22
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:58,079
Who injured you like this?

23
00:01:58,599 --> 00:01:59,959
Just a squabble.

24
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:03,000
What's in your hand?

25
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,400
Your Highness, please put me down.

26
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,479
Show me what's in your hand.

27
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,719
I'll then put you down.

28
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:23,400
What is this?

29
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:26,159
A drug for pain relief from Miao Region.

30
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,719
It's called Iris Fragrant Oil.

31
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:30,400
Still some left.

32
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,680
For this very reason,

33
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,360
you suffered such bullying?

34
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:38,479
Tell me, who is it?

35
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:41,280
Your Highness's reputation
lies in tatters.

36
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:43,400
Do not cause more trouble.

37
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:45,520
My reputation is such.

38
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,199
For you,

39
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,639
what harm is there
in yet another slander?

40
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:54,520
Sheng Yueling.

41
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,479
Sheng Yueling.

42
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,039
Sheng Yueling.

43
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:14,439
Who did it?

44
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,439
Based on my findings,

45
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:18,560
it is...

46
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,199
Spit it out.

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,199
Princess Chuyao and Miss Qin
did it deliberately.

48
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,800
Princess Chuyao's birthday
is approaching.

49
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,639
Let's send her a nice gift.

50
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:32,280
Your Highness.

51
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,879
You now have a bad name.

52
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:35,639
Princess Chuyao has Empress Dowager.

53
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:36,400
Miss Qin has

54
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,159
General Qin's subordinates.

55
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,919
We can't afford enmity with them now.

56
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,280
Those hurting my people

57
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:44,520
must pay the price.

58
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:50,560
Up.

59
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:56,879
Don't.

60
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,319
- Your Highness.
- From now on,

61
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:03,719
you are Princess Sheng Yueling
of Sheng State.

62
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,039
Don't.

63
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,879
Fear not. I'm here.

64
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:33,079
I'm here.

65
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:40,040
How long have I been unconscious?

66
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,800
Two days.

67
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:43,360
You're always here?

68
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:44,879
Always.

69
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,240
What happened to me?

70
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:53,639
The physician says

71
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,120
you suffered from

72
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,399
concussion-induced coma.

73
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,839
Need proper care and rest.

74
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,439
Here's your medicine.

75
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:11,759
Is it bitter?

76
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:23,439
Now we share weal and woe.

77
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:45,040
This deep palace lives

78
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,639
all evil spirits.

79
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,639
A little carelessness

80
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,040
may lead to death.

81
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:57,759
Is Your Highness a good person
or a bad person?

82
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,600
Good to the good.

83
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,920
Bad to the bad.

84
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,519
What if

85
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,399
I am a bad person?

86
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:12,720
I see you, clearly.

87
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:14,079
You and I

88
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:16,480
are just mayflies in this chaotic world.

89
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,120
Both dreaming of shaking the big tree.

90
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:22,480
Then do you trust me?

91
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:33,639
If this doesn't count as trust,

92
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,639
what does?

93
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:40,759
Let's go
shake the big tree together, then.

94
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,959
Your Highness,
Princess has verified the truth

95
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,759
of what's
in the Miao Region Medical Records.

96
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:09,959
The pollen in the ink

97
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:11,399
matches that in the floral oil.

98
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,560
I once smelled the same scent

99
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,079
in my mother's bedchamber.

100
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,759
Back then I thought

101
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,639
Mother just changed the incense.

102
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:25,079
If only I had discovered it earlier.

103
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,240
Concubine Yu and Lord Hui
died of the same cause?

104
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,759
Concubine Yu was virtuous in the palace.

105
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,720
Never heard she had any enemies.

106
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,920
Who could be so vile?

107
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,560
My mother passed away
at the time of selecting the heir.

108
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,240
Princes were eagerly watching,

109
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,399
wanting to draw up the best defense map,

110
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:49,000
to win the Emperor's favor.

111
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,360
My mother

112
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,360
was born into a military family
and skilled in cartography.

113
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,839
Could it be

114
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:01,959
for the defense map my mother drew?

115
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,959
Crown Prince successfully
moved to the Eastern Palace

116
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:09,079
for drawing up the map.

117
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,879
Could it be?

118
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:13,720
Chu Yifan.

119
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:18,199
No matter what,

120
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:19,680
let's keep it low.

121
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:21,439
We need to gather more evidence.

122
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:22,199
Understood.

123
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,160
Right.

124
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:27,000
Is tomorrow the birthday
of Princess of Sheng?

125
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,480
Princess of Sheng...

126
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,839
You mean our Princess?

127
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,480
Yes, it is.

128
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,919
Your Highness, shall I arrange?

129
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,159
No need.

130
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,480
Your Highness.

131
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,399
Tomorrow is also
Princess Chuyao's coming-of-age day.

132
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,919
Should we send Princess Chuyao a gift?

133
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,200
Of course.

134
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,840
