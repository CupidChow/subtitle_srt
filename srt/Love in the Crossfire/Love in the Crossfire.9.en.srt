00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,760
Prince Chen. Princess Chen.

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,559
This is Lord Hui's personal servant.

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,440
Prince Chen often visited Lord Hui.

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,120
They argued often.

7
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:25,879
As we all know,

8
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:27,960
Concubine Yu was angered to death
by Prince Chen.

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,440
Prince Chen

10
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:31,519
pressed the Lord
to speak a non-existent truth.

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,759
I was outside the door,

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,960
and heard Prince say

13
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,359
if Lord Hui didn't tell the truth,

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,759
he would beat Lord to death.

15
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,240
You insist

16
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:40,880
that Lord Hui was killed by Prince Chen.

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,000
Did you personally witness

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,960
how Prince Chen killed Lord Hui?

19
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:46,159
Obviously

20
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:48,479
with fists.

21
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,159
With fists?

22
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:55,679
Now answer me.

23
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:56,920
Lord Hui's ink

24
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,600
was prepared by you personally?

25
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,079
Yes, it was.

26
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,560
Then did you add something to it?

27
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,239
I... I did not.

28
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:11,480
I don't know.

29
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,200
I...

30
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,159
What's going on?

31
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:23,760
Dead.

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,920
Suicide out of guilt.

33
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,359
Suicide out of guilt?

34
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,959
Junior Minister, this servant's words
lack clarity.

35
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:32,120
Not valid as proof.

36
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,439
Moreover, Lord Hui was not killed
by Prince Chen.

37
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,760
He died of chronic poisoning.

38
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,239
Poisoning?

39
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:39,680
Nonsense.

40
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:42,000
The coroner checked it
with a silver needle on the day.

41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,280
No signs of poisoning.

42
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:45,079
The poison Lord Hui suffered

43
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:46,599
is a rare type of floral poison.

44
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:49,000
A silver needle cannot detect.

45
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:50,159
Floral poison?

46
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:52,760
As I recall,
to make the floral poison take effect,

47
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,040
a catalyst is required.

48
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:55,560
What sort of catalyst?

49
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,000
Mengding tribute tea.

50
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,680
Lord Hui had long inhaled
the aroma of the floral ink.

51
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,120
When it happened,

52
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,400
he was actually drinking
the Mengding tribute tea.

53
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,400
Ask the coroner to examine
the internal organs,

54
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,280
to check for any signs of failure.

55
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,960
Princess's pharmacology theory
is too obscure.

56
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,840
I need to bring the coroner

57
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,879
to examine Lord Hui's body again.

58
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:17,120
That would be great.

59
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,039
Prince Chen has no murder motive.

60
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,199
He's not administered poison.

61
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,479
Would you still take Prince Chen away?

62
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:26,000
Before the body is examined,

63
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,736
Prince Chen must stay
at the Ministry of Justice.

64
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,319
You...

65
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:32,280
I'd see
who dares to take Prince Chen away.

66
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,800
Ruheng.

67
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,639
I've heard everything.

68
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,599
Since there isn't enough evidence

69
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,039
proving Prince Chen's crime,

70
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,360
why still take him away, then?

71
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,039
Empress Dowager,

72
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,599
please calm your anger.
I'm being too hasty.

73
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:04,319
I'll free Prince Chen right away.

74
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:06,000
All right.

75
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,680
It's enough.

76
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,080
Ruheng.

77
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm quite concerned for you.

78
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,960
I invited the Empress Dowager
to save you.

79
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,319
Am I great?

80
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:32,280
Ruheng, why ignore me?

81
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,000
This is Princess Chuyao.

82
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:36,800
Born to Lord Wu's Mansion.

83
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,199
Adopted by the Emperor,

84
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:39,000
Named a princess.

85
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:41,360
Raised personally by Empress Dowager.

86
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:43,759
Although the daughter of a lord,

87
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,280
she grew up with princesses

88
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,759
in the imperial palace.

89
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:48,840
She yearns to wed Your Highness.

90
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,759
But too young.

91
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:52,159
Not to the marriageable age.

92
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,000
After reaching the age, then?

93
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,439
After that age,

94
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,039
it remains to be seen.

95
00:03:58,759 --> 00:03:59,560
Perhaps...

96
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:04,199
(Could it be Chuyao)

97
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:06,479
(the one His Highness holds dear?)

98
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:08,840
Yao.

99
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,159
Stop it.

100
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,400
I need to talk to Ruheng.

101
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:13,919
You return first.

102
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,919
I'll leave.

103
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,680
So you're Ruheng's newly-wed wife?

104
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,399
Your Highness.

105
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,600
It's for you.

106
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,399
For me?

107
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:33,120
I only give dolls to people I like.

108
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,439
I still have plenty.

109
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,720
Upon receiving your letter,

110
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,519
I rushed back.

111
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,879
Thought it through this time?

112
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:05,399
I've always wanted you
to lead your mother's followers,

113
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:06,639
and assume military command.

114
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,639
In this deep palace,

115
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:11,199
power begets choice.

116
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:15,120
The name of mother and teacher-killer

117
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,639
would not have fallen upon you.

118
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:21,319
Your Majesty, I understand.

119
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:23,240
I just don't want to

120
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,879
get caught up in
palace rivalries and blood feuds.

121
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,759
I want nationwide peace,

122
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,319
and family joys.

123
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,000
Heng,

124
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,160
you're naive.

125
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,680
Better to make an early decision.

126
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,720
Take command of your mother's followers.

127
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:41,800
Siblings clash.

128
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,959
Father-son deadly conflict.

129
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:44,920
You want to see these?

130
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,439
This bloodstained power

131
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,600
is the least I want.

132
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,079
You can't protect your mother.

133
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:53,600
Nor can you protect your teacher.

134
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,800
You can't even protect yourself.

135
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,879
How come
nationwide peace and family joys?

136
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,160
With no power or troops,

137
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:07,800
you just see people around you
die one by one for no reason.

138
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:11,720
You stand in light;
your enemies, in shadows.

139
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,720
Aren't you worried about your wife?

140
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:27,000
I do not want this bloodstained power.

141
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,279
A puppet emperor,

142
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:31,000
I wish not to be.

143
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,720
This Chu Ruheng.

144
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:52,279
Already into someone.

145
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,600
Why give me this hairpin?

146
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:57,839
Who is exactly the one

147
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,839
he's into?

148
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:03,240
Who he likes

149
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,240
is none of my business.
