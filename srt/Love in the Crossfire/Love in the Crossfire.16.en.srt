(Secretly Meeting Someone)

3
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,120
Hurry up.

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,440
The emissary is coming.

5
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:46,799
Ruheng, I've awaited you for ages.

6
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:47,600
Where is Princess?

7
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,400
I'm asking you. Where is Princess?

8
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,680
This is your palace.

9
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,959
Why asking me?

10
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,359
Besides, she's a person.

11
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:24,879
How would I know where she is?

12
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:26,799
Maybe secretly meeting someone.

13
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,400
Chuyao.

14
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,079
Empress Dowager's backing

15
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,400
doesn't mean you can do anything.

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,840
If I don't see Princess today,

17
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,319
I'll kill you.

18
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:50,280
You dare threaten me?

19
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:03,280
What if

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,599
Prince Chen, already married, is accused

21
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,400
of forcing a princess?

22
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,879
Chu Ruheng, you made me do this.

23
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:22,560
Ruheng, don't!

24
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,080
Ruheng, don't!

25
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,599
Did you hear it?

26
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,280
Did she run away?

27
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:41,280
It can't be.

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,919
If she did run away,

29
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:44,599
Princess Chuyao would kill us both.

30
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,960
Maybe we should go check.

31
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,800
Where is she? She's gone.

32
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,400
Send her back to the mansion.

33
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,039
Also,

34
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,479
where have they taken Prince?

35
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,719
Go find her immediately!

36
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:05,000
Copy.

37
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,120
Search, hurry!

38
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,800
Okay.

39
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,879
Your Highness,
Chuyao and her people are already on it.

40
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,680
Then we'll play them at their own game.

41
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,240
My beauty, here I come.

42
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,080
The woman from the Central Plains
is so fair-skinned.

43
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,159
Wonder what they taste like.

44
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,039
Help! Help!

45
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,599
Come here, my beauty.

46
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:49,680
Let go of me.

47
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,599
Help!

48
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,639
Smells so good.

49
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,360
Help!

50
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,280
So fair, my beauty.

51
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:03,000
Help!

52
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:05,039
How dare you.

53
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,160
Your Majesty.

54
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:18,800
It's probably too late
to block the news now.

55
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:20,879
The pressing issue right now

56
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,360
is to preserve Princess' innocence.

57
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,120
You mean?

58
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:28,759
Marriage alliance.

59
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,319
In the form of an imperial edict,

60
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:33,000
announcing the marriage to all.

61
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,800
No.

62
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:35,000
No.

63
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:38,560
Your Majesty!

64
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,560
I... don't want...

65
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,279
I don't want to be married to Miao.

66
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:42,319
I don't want to...

67
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,160
Given the current situation,

68
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,639
there's no other choice.

69
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,160
Chuyao.

70
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,279
Come back with me.

71
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,399
I don't want to.

72
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:58,199
Your Majesty.

73
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:04,160
Your Highness, Princess has been found.

74
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,759
Where is she?

75
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:05,319
In the room.

76
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:32,680
I don't know
what you've been through tonight.

77
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,040
It's all my fault.

78
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,120
I failed to protect you.

79
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:56,959
I'm here.

80
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:58,879
I'm here.

81
00:06:10,836 --> 00:06:12,319
(Details)

82
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,439
How is it, any clues?

83
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,800
This truly is

84
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,040
the register of secret trades
between Yu and Miao.

85
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,600
Many issues

86
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,600
simply cannot be investigated in Yu.

87
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,120
What about the iris?

88
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,920
There are some, indeed.

89
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,319
But...

90
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,040
Look who the trader is.

91
00:06:33,908 --> 00:06:35,968
(Buyer Qin Muyi bought it
from merchant Cuba.)

92
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:37,399
Qin Muyi?
