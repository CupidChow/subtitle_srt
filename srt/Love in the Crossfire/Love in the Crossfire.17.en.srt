00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,719
There are some, indeed.

4
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:19,440
But...

5
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:22,160
Look who the trader is.

6
00:00:25,523 --> 00:00:27,936
(Buyer Qin Muyi bought it
from merchant Cuba.)

7
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:29,320
Qin Muyi?

8
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,119
She cares so much about you.

9
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,840
No reason she'd harm your mother.

10
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,439
This morning,

11
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,439
she sent over some pastries.

12
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:48,200
What?

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,840
Today is the memorial day
of Concubine Yu.

14
00:00:58,759 --> 00:00:59,759
Not tell you

15
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,719
just not to make you feel confined.

16
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,640
Here.

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,719
Your Highness.

18
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,560
The offerings for Concubine Yu
are ready.

When loved ones pass away,

36
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,120
we make lotus lanterns to remember them.

37

The lanterns burn bright,

My mother cared for the well-being
of the people throughout her life.

47
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,680
But she didn't see peace
across the land.

48
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,360
Peace requires a wise ruler.

49
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,039
Although Crown Prince is diligent,

50
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,840
he has weak foundations.

51
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,280
So he's easily restrained.

52
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,719
He's now allied with the heir of Miao.

53
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,400
It's like inviting a wolf home.

54
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:53,800
You'd make a better Emperor
than Crown Prince.

Only by having a wise ruler like you,

56
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,000
can there be millions of

Good, very good.

62
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:31,360
Go check Nan Xing,
guard of Sheng Princess.

63
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,240
See what he's doing.

64
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,360
It's time to let them know

65
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,879
where the defense map is.

66
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:38,639
We are ready to close the net.

67

Speaking of Crown Prince,

68
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:45,519
I always feel something wrong.

69
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:49,639
The register directly points to
Qin Muyi.

70
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:52,759
Got any good plan?

71
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,279
Beat them at their own game.

72
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,920
Since the mind behind

73
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,680
wants to pin the blame on Qin Muyi,

74
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,079
let's just go with his plan,

75
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:00,319
to wrong Qin Muyi.

76
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:01,759
In this way,

77
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,160
someone will surely take actions

78
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:05,920
to remove her.

79
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,079
Then whoever takes such actions

80
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:09,839
will be the real mind behind.

81
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:11,600
Wouldn't it be too risky?

82
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,920
Although Qin Muyi tried to harm me
many times,

83
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:16,240
we can't just disregard her life.

84
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:18,759
I'll arrange that.

85
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:21,079
Perhaps,

86
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,079
we need to stage a play.

87
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,439
Qin Muyi.

88
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,360
Do you confess?

89
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,720
Crown Prince.

90
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,480
Confess what?

91
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,199
You made these pastries, didn't you?

92
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:49,279
Yes, I did.

93
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,639
These pastries contain iris powder.

94
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,680
You surely knew that, didn't you?

95
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,000
It is the iris powder
that poisoned Concubine Yu to death.

96
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,600
Ruheng.

97
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,399

is right here.

You decide.

99
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:07,079
Your commands, Crown Prince.

100
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,839
I've no idea

101
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:10,160
of this iris powder.

102
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:13,319
Take her away.

103
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:15,480
It wasn't me, Crown Prince.

104
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,360
It wasn't me.

105
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,279

- Go.
