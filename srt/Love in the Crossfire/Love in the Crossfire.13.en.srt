(Entanglement Between Her and Two Men)

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,799
Yue.

4
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,880
I'm so useless

5
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:47,280
to let you suffer such humiliation.

6
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:48,520
Scold me.

7
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,200
It will make me feel better.

8
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:52,640
Don't say that.

9
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:54,039
Ever since we were kids,

10
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:55,600
we've stood by each other.

11
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,200
You mean a lot to me.

12
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,119
You saved my life

13
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:01,880
at the refugee camp.

14
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,600
Take it

15
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:05,000
whenever you want it back.

16
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:06,159
For you,

17
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,239
I can sacrifice myself.

18
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,159
Your life is solely yours.

19
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:11,879
No one can control you,

20
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:12,879
including me.

21
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:15,920
Then from now on,

22
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:18,040
I'll surely guard you well.

23
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:25,439
Are you feeling better?

24
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,640
Dinner is ready.

25
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:28,760
Let's dine.

26
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:30,519
You first.

27
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:33,120
I'll wait a bit more.

28
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:42,760
You're waiting for Chu Ruheng?

29
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:44,519
Yue.

30
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:47,560
We should not forget
Princess' entrustment,

31
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,799
and the warfare experiences
since our childhood.

32
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,200
I haven't forgotten these.

33
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,319
I'm worried you'll just sink deeper,

34
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,480
and forget your path here.

35
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,719
The day after tomorrow is

36
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:02,680
Princess's birthday.

37
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,719
Let's go visit Princess.

38
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,919
Muyi.

39
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,759
Will Ruheng come today?

40
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,039
Of course.

41
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,039
It's your coming-of-age birthday.

42
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,319
Prince Chen will come,
emotionally and rationally.

43
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:21,280
Then, what will Ruheng give me?

44
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,520
Prince Chen's gift

45
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,960
will surely please you.

46
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:27,919
You are absolutely radiant today.

47
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,879
Didn't you see Princess Chuyao's here?

48
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,840
Why all the hurry-scurry?

49
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:44,639
Princess.

50
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:46,439
Miss, bad news.

51
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,520
What happened?

52
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:51,319
I heard that

53
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,560
Prince Chen was intercepted
on his way here

54
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,439
by Princess Chen.

55
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,800
Why?

56
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,039
I... dare not say.

57
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:05,080
Just spit it out.

58
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:08,879
Today is Princess Chen's birthday.

59
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,479
She insisted that

60
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:11,960
Prince Chen accompany her.

61
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,000
The two of them have been out
for quite a while.

62
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:17,319
She has the same birthday as me.

63
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,199
This wretched bitch
even snatched my people.

64
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:25,759
Chuyao, don't let her bother you.

65
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:33,800
What is that in your hand?

66
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,759
I deserve punishment.

67
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,360
It's the congratulatory gift
from Prince Chen.

68
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,360
Chuyao.

69
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,439
Why not take a look

70
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:43,080
at the gift from Ruheng?

71
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,599
Who's so bold?

72
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,759
What's it?

73
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,759
It...

74
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:05,199
It couldn't be Ruheng.

75
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,719
He couldn't have destroyed
your favorite doll.

76
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,599
Who gave you this brocade box?

77
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,960
Princess Chen.

78
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,079
Chuyao, we all know Ruheng.

79
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:23,720
But, this woman looks simple.

80
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,480
But she's actually cruel and cunning.

81
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:28,360
Could it be
that she's getting back at you

82
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,639
for that day?

83
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,800
As I see, they've united

84
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,920
to humiliate me.

85
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,839
No matter who it is,

86
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,279
my day of birth

87
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:37,720
will be their day of doom.

88
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,160
Your Highness.

89
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,879
Princess went out with Nan Xing today.

90
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:00,120
Got it. You may go now.

91
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:01,439
Yes.

92
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,959
Isn't today your birthday?

93
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:17,199
Why did you two go out?

94
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:38,079
Yue.

95
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:42,399
You must also miss Princess.

96
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:51,680
Look, what is this?

97
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,800
A portrait of Princess.

98
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:02,079
After I drew the bandits away,

99
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:03,639
I went back to look for you.

100
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,319
It's found in my lost luggage.

101
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,040
Yue, your eyes

102
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,240
truly resemble Princess'.

103
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,800
Poor Princess.

104
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,800
It's all because of wars.

105
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,279
If she weren't forced into
this marriage,

106
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,079
we should be at home now,

107
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,439
celebrating her birthday together.

108
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:31,480
Yu caused all these.

109
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,439
They

110
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,360
made us lose everything.

111
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:36,639
Yue.

112
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,199
Once we find the defense map,

113
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,439
we'll go home.

114
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:42,240
Home.

115
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,319
In Sheng,

116
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,079
do we still have a home?

117
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,639
Yue, I will give you a home.

118
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:04,680
Yue.

119
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:07,920
I like you.

120
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,240
I like you too.

121
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,120
Nan Xing, you are my family.

122
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:17,199
My only kin in this world.

123
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:23,839
But that's not the kind of like I want.

124
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,160
Nan Xing.

125
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:31,199
Will you

126
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:34,439
abandon me?

127
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:36,800
Good Nan Xing.

128
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,199
How could I abandon you?

129
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:56,319
Nan Xing.

130
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:17,240
I'll see you in Hongbu Corridor.

131
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,399
Yue.

132
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,800
Nan Xing, you go back first.
Don't wait for me.

133
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,240
Yue, don't go.

134
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,879
Chu Ruheng.

135
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,279
