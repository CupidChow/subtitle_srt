(I Beg You)

3
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,280
You've got the military defense map.
Why aren't you leaving?

4
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:38,600
I'm asking you. You have this map.

5
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,759
Why aren't you leaving?

6
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:44,719
Time to go.

7
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:47,159
Why isn't Yue back yet?

8
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,079
Fine.

9
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:55,280
Then tell me.

10
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:58,359
Who helped you get the defense map?

11
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,159
No?

12
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:09,760
Lufeng.

13
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,319
Here.

14
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:11,599
Bing Nan Xing here.

15
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:16,640
Arrest him.

16
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,280
Yes.

17
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:17,959
You...

18
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:23,920
Chu Ruheng.

19
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:26,480
What do you want exactly?

20
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,640
I'm at your discretion.

21
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:32,000
Release Nan Xing.

22
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,200
He is just a servant in the mansion.

23
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:35,719
Not your real intention.

24
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,359
He's no use to me.

25
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:38,640
Chu Ruheng.

26
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,560
I beg you.

27
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:44,959
Now, obey.

28
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:45,920
Otherwise,

29
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,599
I'll make Nan Xing perish
before you instantly.

30
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:49,280
Don't.

31
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,760
Chu Ruheng, have you gone mad?

32
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:57,480
Did I not just tell you,

33
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,200
saving others is not enough.

34
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,519
You should learn to kill.

35
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,200
I'm now killing the person
you most want to protect.

36
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:04,840
Don't.

37
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,840
What will you do?

38
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:08,080
Don't.

39
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,759
Princess.

40
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,080
No worry about me.

41
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,759
I'll count to three.

42
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:14,520
Three.

43
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,319
Two.

44
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,319
Don't.

45
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:21,960
One.

46
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,800
Don't.

47
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,159
Chu Ruheng.

48
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:30,919
A man can be killed,

49
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:32,039
but not humiliated. Do it.

50
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,759
Take him away.

51
00:02:37,344 --> 00:02:37,960
Move.

52
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,639
Princess.

53
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,520
Chu Ruheng, what exactly do you want?

54
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,240
Teach you to kill.

55
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:49,719
I don't want to kill anyone.

56
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,439
Military defense map.

57
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,560
Chu Ruheng,
this is the military defense map.

58
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,240
Feel like killing me now?

59
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,400
If killing could solve problems,

60
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,919
then the world would be problem-free.

61
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,479
We, from a fragile state,
walk on thin ice.

62
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:52,159
We're simply at others' mercy.

63
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,879
If one day,

64
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:55,560
to survive,

65
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,120
you have to kill me,

66
00:03:58,919 --> 00:03:59,840
would you do it?

67
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,120
I've no idea.

68
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,039
If one day,

69
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:10,520
to survive,

70
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:13,680
you must kill me.

71
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,439
The defense map is fake.

72
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,839
What?

73
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,160
Fake?

74
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:25,600
It's a top secret of Yu.

75
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:29,279
Do you really think
you could get it so easily?

76
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,920
You way underestimate my state.

77
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,839
Warfare between Yu and Sheng has eased.

78
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,360
But warmongers eager to conquer Sheng

79
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,079
are prevalent in the palace.

80
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:41,920
I know what you're planning.

81
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,160
I lured you with the fake map.

82
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,560
It's merely a stopgap.

83
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:46,199
If, like the last time,

84
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:48,240
they found out what you're up to
in Eastern Palace,

85
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,560
Crown Prince could accuse you
of stealing Yu's top secret,

86
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,360
and launch a war against Sheng.

87
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,480
At that time,

88
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,240
you'll be the sinners.

89
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,480
So,

90
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,519
you're doing this for our peace?

91
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:06,560
Yes

92
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,399
and no.

93
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:10,240
Then,

94
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,120
you are protecting me?

95
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,040
Make sure you play your role
as the alliance princess.

96
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,360
When the right moment comes,

97
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,399
I will send you back.

98
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:26,199
The alliance between Yu and Sheng

99
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:30,000
should not be consolidated
through sacrificing women.

100
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,360
You are neither the crown prince,

101
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,000
nor the emperor.

102
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,439
Your words

103
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:41,240
are just like these ashes.

104
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:43,480
Insignificant.

105
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,399
How can I trust you?

106
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:52,399
If you don't trust me, then whom?

107
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:54,120
Rather than trusting you,

108
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,360
I'd trust myself.

109
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,279
Trust yourself?

110
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:02,399
Then, see what you find yourself in.

111
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:07,759
During this period,

112
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,680
stay at the mansion.

113
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,160
Stay well.

114
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:16,360
Believe it or not,

115
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,399
my promise to you,

116
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,759
I'll surely deliver it.

117
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:56,199
(Can she understand)

118
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,759
(what I have done?)

119
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:00,920
(Were the words too strong?)

120
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:06,000
(He used a fake map)

121
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,879
(to protect me.)

122
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,519
(What exactly is he thinking?)

123
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,639
(Perhaps I should check on her.)

124
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,079
(Maybe I should ask him for clarity.)

125
00:07:41,984 --> 00:07:42,639
Princess.

126
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:43,399
Your Highness.

127
00:07:45,568 --> 00:07:46,199
Go ahead.

128
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,240
Go ahead.

129
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:57,040
On that day you said

130
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,639
Lord Hui died from a floral poison.

131
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,879
Have you ever seen this flower?

132
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:04,759
The Miao Region Medical Records

133
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:06,839
describes a herb called Iris.

134
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:08,480
Iris?

135
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,519
This flower is banned in Yu State.

136
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:14,000
I know little about it.

137
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:17,240
Iris is a potent painkiller.

138
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,800
It's unique to Miao Region.

139
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,319
It's potent and highly addictive.

140
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,360
Prolonged use may harm organs.

141
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,000
When combined with Mengding tribute tea,

142
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,199
it turns toxic,

143
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,079
inducing gradual organ failure.

144
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,679
But the pressing matter now

145
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,320
is to find the real Iris.

146
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,279
We can then confirm what the book says.

147
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,679
Iris, a banned bloom of Yu.

148
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:44,639
Mengding tribute tea,
exclusively for royalty.

149
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,240
Both are exceedingly rare.

150
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:49,480
The person who can obtain these two

151
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:52,320
must be someone from the royal family.

152
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,840
You said in Lord Hui's ink scroll,

153
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,480
iris' scent permeates.

154
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:58,639
This reminds me that

155
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,320
in my mother's room,

156
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,799
I smelled the same scent once.

157
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,600
Why do people say
you angered Concubine Yu to death?

158
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:08,360
People follow blindly.

159
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:11,679
I once went against my mother's wishes,

160
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:14,200
and insisted on going to Miao Region
to quell the chaos.

161
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,440
It sparked widespread attention.

162
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:20,799
But my mother was certainly
not petty-minded.

163
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,519
She would never die out of anger.

164
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,799
Turns out it's all rumors.

165
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,919
So,

166
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:29,159
you've been investigating
your mother's death?

167
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,759
Yes.

168
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,159
You said

169
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,120
when the right moment comes,

170
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:37,639
you will let us return,

171
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,879
and ensure peace between our two states.

172
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,879
Does the right time refer to

173
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,440
the day you've got the truth
of your mother's death?

174
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,759
Yes.

175
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,840
Okay, I promise you.

176
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,960
I'll help you with your investigation.

177
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,120
Please fulfill your promise
as soon as possible.

178
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,000
I promise.

179
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:58,879
Given your knowledge of iris' traits,

180
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:00,600
have you ever been to

181
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:03,000
a refugee camp closest to Miao Region,

182
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,399
and saved someone there?

183
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:06,360
