(A Life For A Life)

3
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,920
Have you ever been to

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,120
a refugee camp closest to Miao Region,

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,359
and saved someone there?

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,399
I...

7
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,640
(Why's he asking this?)

8
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,760
(Is he suspecting my identity?)

9
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:29,719
I've never been there.

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,719
I am a princess.

11
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:32,159
Why would I go to a refugee camp?

12
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:33,880
That knowledge

13
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,679
is from books.

14
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:39,920
(She just won't admit it.)

15
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:41,200
Your Highness.

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,520
It's getting late.

17
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,000
Rest early.

18
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,079
Upon investigating,

19
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:12,480
iris indeed grows in Miao Region.

20
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,359
This flower yields very little.

21
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,719
Its sales are banned in Yu.

22
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,120
Very scarce on the black market.

23
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,519
Keep on the investigation.

24
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,359
Inform our assets in Miao.

25
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:22,359
Miao Emperor's heir will soon come,

26
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:23,760
with ill intentions, I worry.

27
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:26,480
Ask them to keep a close watch
on his movements.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,799
Understood.

29
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:29,519
By the way,

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,040
where's Princess? No sight of her.

31
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,159
Tributes have arrived before the person.

32
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:35,159
Crown Prince received

33
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:36,760
the treasures from Miao Emperor's heir.

34
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:38,359
Crown Prince invited Princess to

35
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,159
attend the treasure appreciation event.

36
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,560
Treasure appreciation event?

37
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,480
This item may help Chu Ruheng.

38
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,520
Princess Chuyao.

39
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:22,960
Yueling, that in your hand.

40
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,479
I like it.

41
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:27,039
You have taken what I like.

42
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,039
Princess Chuyao.

43
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:31,719
In Crown Prince's palace just now,
we competed.

44
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,400
I won it by luck.

45
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,560
It's granted by Crown Prince.

46
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,039
Do you mean

47
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,520
that I've lost?

48
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,599
Princess Chuyao.

49
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,240
She's just flaunting her win over you.

50
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,879
Yueling.

51
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:45,879
Give it to me.

52
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,520
It's mine; I can't give it to you.

53
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:50,800
Give it to me!

54
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,120
Up.

55
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:44,960
Stop.

56
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,599
Yueling.

57
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,719
Still not give it to me?

58
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,520
Let go.

59
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,919
Princess Chen, let go.

60
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,120
Lose a hand for a trifle.

61
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,240
Not worth it.

62
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,280
Let go or not?

63
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,759
As long as I want it,

64
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,319
I will get it.

65
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:26,240
Yueling.

66
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,720
This must be important to you?

67
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,439
I won this fair and square.

68
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,000
Why snatch it?

69
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,399
I like it.

70
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:35,560
Want it?

71
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:36,759
Yueling.

72
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:39,560
If you kneel and beg me,

73
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,800
perhaps I'll grant it to you.

74
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:44,480
Princess Chen, just kneel and confess.

75
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,279
I beg you to grant it to me.

76
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,600
I beg you to grant it to me.

77
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:21,959
I beg you to grant it to me.

78
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,600
No.

79
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:25,639
No.

80
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,720
No.

81
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,360
No.

82
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,800
Your Highness.

83
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,279
We have nothing against each other.

84
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:51,120
Why are you doing this to me?

85
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,199
As long as it's what you want,

86
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,720
I'll destroy it.

87
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:57,560
Also,

88
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,240
your disappearance

89
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,399
also matters to me.

90
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,480
Stop it.

91
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,399
Your Highness, I'll take you back.

92
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,040
Nan Xing.

93
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,720
A mere guard.

94
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,079
How dare you.

95
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:23,360
Kill me, now.

96
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,839
Let go and fire the arrow.

97
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:25,800
Kill me.

98
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,519
Nan Xing.

99
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,439
Leave here.

100
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,959
They've gone too far.

101
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,240
Kill me, now!

102
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:40,360
If you don't,

103
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,560
I'm going to kill your princess now.

104
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:47,920
Or, a life for a life.

105
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:50,360
Use your life

106
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:53,199
to exchange for her life.

107
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:55,000
Nan Xing, leave.

108
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,800
I don't like waiting.

109
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,000
Leave!

110
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,199
I'll count to three.

111
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:02,199
Three.

112
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,000
Leave.

113
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,519
Two.

114
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:09,240
One.

115
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:17,920
I give my life to you.

116
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,199
Don't, Nan Xing.

117
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:21,639
Release our princess.

118
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:24,319
I honor my word.

119
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:33,000
In the next life...

120
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,439
In the next life, I...

121
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:36,879
Don't.

122
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,519
In the next life,
I'll still be your star,

123
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:44,480
accompanying you.

124
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:45,560
Don't.

125
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,680
In Yu State,

126
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,000
no one can kill people for no reason.

127
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:01,879
Crown Prince.

128
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:04,720
Incorrigible.

129
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,800
Let Empress Dowager punish you.

130
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:16,839
Your Highness.

131
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,720
I need more of the sugar pills
you gave me last time.
