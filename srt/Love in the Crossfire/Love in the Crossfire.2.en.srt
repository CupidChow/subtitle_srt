(Wedding Night)

3
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,640
Your Highness.

4
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:29,719
She truly is Princess of Sheng State.

5
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:31,079
The marriage pact is here.

6
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,840
(Chongwen Hall of Eastern Palace)
You saved the Princess

7
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,119
in such a remote place.

8
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:46,159
It's like
you two are really fated to meet.

9
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,880
Just a coincidence.

10
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:49,880
However,

11
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,280
unrest is rising here and there.

12
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:52,880
Displaced people resort to banditry.

13
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,640
It's time to put order in.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,880
Since my mother passed away,

15
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,560
Father put me under Concubine Yu's care.

16
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:01,719
You and I grew up together.

17
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,679
We're the closest.

18
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,879
Before Father lost consciousness,

19
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,920
Sheng State proposed marriage alliance.

20
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,760
The two states picked you

21
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:12,040
for this marriage.

22
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:13,680
I'm worried that they

23
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:15,200
have hidden agendas.

24
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,640
What?

25
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,319
This woman who comes from nowhere

26
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:22,799
is the princess to marry Ruheng?

27
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:25,079
Miss, calm down.

28
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,439
She is just an abandoned princess
for marriage alliance.

29
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,519
She's no match for you.

30
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:32,400
Can't let them be real couple.

31
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,319
The marriage alliance is probably
just a delaying trick of Sheng.

32
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:38,959
So be it.

33
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,120
My Yu State is rock solid.

34
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,640
This princess
from the defeated Sheng State

35
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,319
is even less of a concern.

36
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,480
But if

37
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:52,280
this princess comes for the defense map?

38
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,200
Then we shall use their plan
against them.

39
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,239
The wedding will be bustling
with large crowds.

40
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,519
It's optimal chance for action.

41
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,159
Do you have a plan?

42
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,240
The Sheng State nears its end

43
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,159
and sends a princess
for marriage alliance?

44
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,319
Such a lady from the royal family

45
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:29,159
without favor

46
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,919
is just a plaything for the likes of us.

47
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:33,919
In this palace,

48
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:35,439
too many women are out of favor.

49
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,039
So we two...

50
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:47,639
Please spare my life.

51
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:49,280
Your Highness, please.

52
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,840
Your Highness, spare my life!

53
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,560
(Add this sleep potion
to the wedding wine.)

54
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,719
(You shall not become the real couple.)

55
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:19,199
The hour nears.

56
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,599
Send over the wedding wine.

57
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:22,479
On my way.

58
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:23,240
Hurry up.

59
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,039
Yes.

60
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,039
(No time now.)

61
00:03:43,155 --> 00:03:45,216
(Horse aphrodisiac.)

62
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,479
(This unpredictable Prince Chen
has an iron fist.)

63
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,680
(Tonight I must protect myself.)

64
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,079
This sleeping potion can help me

65
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,399
get through the wedding night.

66
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,759
But what about the coming days?

67
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,399
Your Highness.

68
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,759
Still watching like this?

69
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:16,439
How about

70
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:19,480
drinking this cup of wedding wine?

71
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,600
As you expect it so much,

72
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,079
how about you taste it first?

73
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,519
By rites,

74
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,519
we should drink this wine together.

75
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,639
So concerned.

76
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:02,079
Is there anything special

77
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,759
in my cup?

78
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:08,639
(Indeed, a suspicious person.)

79
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:11,160
(Fortunately,
I've taken the antidote in advance.)

80
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:12,920
I'll drink then.

81
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:15,680
Your Highness,
do you think I poisoned it?

82
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:21,440
(Horse aphrodisiac)

83
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,279
Fine.

84
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,600
Have a good rest tonight.

85
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:31,319
Your Highness.

86
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:32,800
After drinking this wedding wine,

87
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:34,839
can we be real husband and wife.

88
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:52,120
We're husband and wife
through our wedding vows.

89
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,120
How about...

90
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,240
You.

91
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,800
We go to bed directly.

92
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,199
What?

93
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:04,000
Put me down.

94
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,560
Put me down.

95
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:06,432
Let me go.

96
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:08,199
What do you want?

97
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:10,199
Do what couples do.

98
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:12,560
Don't.

99
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,160
