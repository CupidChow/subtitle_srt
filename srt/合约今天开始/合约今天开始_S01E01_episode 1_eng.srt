1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:07,040


2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,755
It's... it's Oh Jina!

3
00:00:09,755 --> 00:00:12,161
She's coming! She's coming!

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,785
 A name that all Hwayang High School students know. 

5
00:00:20,425 --> 00:00:22,140
 Oh Jina. 

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,305
 If Ji Hyunho is the most famous senior at Hwayang High, 

7
00:00:27,305 --> 00:00:30,010
 then Oh Jina is the most famous junior. 

8
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:33,438
 Despite the tough competition, she was chosen 

9
00:00:33,438 --> 00:00:36,210
 as a trainee for one of the biggest entertainment agencies and... 

10
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,760
Is this all you have? I'm going to look through your stuff now.

11
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,565
I got my allowance today.

12
00:00:40,565 --> 00:00:42,648
So, if it's money you need,

13
00:00:42,648 --> 00:00:44,678
then you should try taking money from me and not him.

14
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:48,338
 There are an endless number of stories about her good deeds. 

15
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,200
 She's the type that doesn't follow what's trendy. 

16
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,857
 She makes her own trend. She's a true celebrity. 

17
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,007
 And another idol trainee at the same entertainment agency, Seong Hanna. 

18
00:01:03,007 --> 00:01:06,991
 And the youngest daughter of the rich building owner in Cheongdam-dong, Joo Minji. 

19
00:01:06,991 --> 00:01:09,998
 A real life story of pretty girls and more pretty girls. 

20
00:01:09,998 --> 00:01:13,708
 And this story is about Oh Jina. 

21
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,780
Hey Lee Seungmin!

22
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,399
- Come on.
- Wow~

23
00:01:25,399 --> 00:01:28,464
Are you watching Jina again this morning?

24
00:01:28,464 --> 00:01:29,853
She just happened to walk by

25
00:01:29,853 --> 00:01:31,326
as I glanced out the window.

26
00:01:31,326 --> 00:01:32,299
Huh?

27
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:34,006
Where is she?

28
00:01:34,006 --> 00:01:35,681
Right there.

29
00:01:38,171 --> 00:01:40,450
How is that right there?

30
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,152
She's aaaall the way over there!

31
00:01:42,152 --> 00:01:43,292
You're overreacting again, Oh Bawool.

32
00:01:43,292 --> 00:01:44,707
Tsk tsk tsk.

33
00:01:45,871 --> 00:01:48,440
Her boyfriend is the number 4 batter Koo Hyungtak.

34
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,229
No matter how you look at it.

35
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:51,809
This way and that.

36
00:01:51,809 --> 00:01:54,767
Goddess Oh Jina over there and the Lee Seungmin who is right here?

37
00:01:54,767 --> 00:01:58,211
You two live in two different worlds.

38
00:01:58,211 --> 00:02:00,581
If you live in a different world,

39
00:02:00,581 --> 00:02:03,485
does that mean you can't even like her?

40
00:02:03,485 --> 00:02:05,757
Can we talk?

41
00:02:06,965 --> 00:02:08,685
Go ahead.

42
00:02:10,695 --> 00:02:12,455
Everyone is watching.

43
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,365
Hey, can I borrow Jina for a minute?

44
00:02:22,677 --> 00:02:24,352
Give it to me.

45
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,771
Thanks, Seungmin.

46
00:02:33,771 --> 00:02:35,486
Don't mention it.

47
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,790
Can you get out of our way?

48
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:44,490
I'm a bit busy right now.

49
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,810
Oh... yes!

50
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,950
 Goddess Oh Jina over there and Lee Seungmin right here 

51
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:53,827
 live in two different worlds! 

52
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,345
What happened yesterday?

53
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:02,355
I was practicing, and I was on a roll all of a sudden.

54
00:03:02,355 --> 00:03:05,114
I was all hyped up

55
00:03:05,114 --> 00:03:07,114
and missed the time.

56
00:03:08,064 --> 00:03:10,889
You could have waited for a couple more hours.

57
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:11,919
I would have shown up eventually.

58
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:12,949
Hey, Koo Hyungtak.

59
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:14,089
Yeah? What?

60
00:03:14,089 --> 00:03:16,316
You must have forgotten the fact that I'm Oh Jina.

61
00:03:16,316 --> 00:03:17,921
You might be confused because I'm dating you,

62
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:20,311
but do I look like a pushover to you?

63
00:03:20,311 --> 00:03:22,401
No!

64
00:03:22,401 --> 00:03:27,420
You're too pretty for me to think anything else about you.

65
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,260
Even though it's late, how about today?

66
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:32,680
Your birthday party that we missed yesterday.

67
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,895
Can you hear it better if you do that?

68
00:03:34,895 --> 00:03:36,955
It seems like they're talking about her birthday or...

69
00:03:36,955 --> 00:03:39,468
Yeah, he went too far this time.

70
00:03:39,468 --> 00:03:41,728
He keeps forgetting to call her because of baseball.

71
00:03:41,728 --> 00:03:43,936
But I didn't think he'd do that on her birthday, too.

72
00:03:43,936 --> 00:03:46,506
Yeah! And he had some nerve before

73
00:03:46,506 --> 00:03:48,797
to say, "Can you let me borrow Jina for a minute?"

74
00:03:48,797 --> 00:03:51,434
What's the use of being good looking?

75
00:03:51,434 --> 00:03:54,317
For her, he's the worst boyfriend ever.

76
00:03:56,551 --> 00:03:58,137
I can't go on anymore.

77
00:03:58,137 --> 00:03:59,492
Are you going to forgive me now?

78
00:03:59,492 --> 00:04:03,003
No, I'm breaking up with you.

79
00:04:03,003 --> 00:04:05,092
So get out of my way.

80
00:04:06,221 --> 00:04:08,365
Take that back.

81
00:04:08,365 --> 00:04:09,675
Then I'll get out of your way.

82
00:04:09,675 --> 00:04:11,467
When did you ever see me take anything back?

83
00:04:11,467 --> 00:04:12,487
I won't take it back.

84
00:04:12,487 --> 00:04:14,488
Why not?

85
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,238
Give me a reason.

86
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:20,256
Why you can't take it back.

87
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,121
I

88
00:04:33,121 --> 00:04:37,406
already... have a new boyfriend.

89
00:04:42,555 --> 00:04:44,160
Really?

90
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,090
Who is he?

91
00:04:47,092 --> 00:04:48,992
I asked, who is he?

92
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:58,972
Him!

93
00:05:02,756 --> 00:05:04,841
Lee Seungmin?

94
00:05:08,945 --> 00:05:11,225
Yeah... so,

95
00:05:11,225 --> 00:05:14,971
he's your new boyfriend now, right?

96
00:05:14,971 --> 00:05:16,738
Huh?

97
00:05:16,738 --> 00:05:18,388
Yeah!

98
00:05:18,388 --> 00:05:20,708
Lee Seungmin on the broadcast club!

99
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:23,573
Introduce me to him.

100
00:05:24,305 --> 00:05:27,828
Then, I'll accept that we're broken up.

101
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,282
That's easy.

102
00:05:29,282 --> 00:05:30,498
How about tomorrow?

103
00:05:30,498 --> 00:05:32,492
Great! Tomorrow.

104
00:05:32,492 --> 00:05:34,240
Okay.

105
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,675
I'll be looking forward to meeting him.

106
00:05:35,675 --> 00:05:36,895
Sure.

107
00:05:41,973 --> 00:05:42,981
Whew...

108
00:05:46,326 --> 00:05:49,862
Jina! What happened?

109
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,975
Help me find him.

110
00:05:53,822 --> 00:05:55,737
Who is that?

111
00:05:55,737 --> 00:05:57,296
Whew...

112
00:06:25,405 --> 00:06:26,632
Hey Seungmin!

113
00:06:26,632 --> 00:06:28,217
Noona!

114
00:06:29,134 --> 00:06:31,233
You're way too busy with the broadcast club.

115
00:06:31,233 --> 00:06:32,640
Why is it so hard to see you these days?

116
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,805
I'm just a freshman.

117
00:06:36,355 --> 00:06:37,945
Who is he?

118
00:06:37,945 --> 00:06:40,485
Oh... this is Seungmin!

119
00:06:40,485 --> 00:06:43,165
Whew... Seungmin...

120
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,575
See you later.

121
00:06:52,953 --> 00:06:54,693
Explain yourself.

122
00:06:54,693 --> 00:06:56,564
Oh... did I not tell you?

123
00:06:56,564 --> 00:06:58,599
I have a younger cousin going to our school.

124
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:00,687
He's my aunt's son.

125
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:02,781
Oh! That nice one!

126
00:07:02,781 --> 00:07:03,891
Yeah.

127
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:06,924
I was worried a lot about him after our aunt passing, but

128
00:07:06,924 --> 00:07:09,611
it's nice to see him smiling. Right?

129
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:11,507
My cousin-in-law.

130
00:07:11,507 --> 00:07:14,533
I should be nice to him the next time I see him.

131
00:07:14,533 --> 00:07:16,626
How about I set him up with someone?

132
00:07:16,626 --> 00:07:18,381
Does he have a girlfriend?

133
00:07:18,381 --> 00:07:19,728
I don't think so.

134
00:07:19,728 --> 00:07:20,753
But who knows.

135
00:07:20,753 --> 00:07:23,858
He might suddenly turn up with someone.

136
00:07:31,455 --> 00:07:34,483
Oh... it's not him.

137
00:07:36,148 --> 00:07:37,378
By any chance,

138
00:07:37,378 --> 00:07:39,651
did my friend do something bad?

139
00:07:39,651 --> 00:07:41,016
Oh!

140
00:07:41,016 --> 00:07:42,638
Then let me apologize for him.

141
00:07:42,638 --> 00:07:44,108
Friend?

142
00:07:44,108 --> 00:07:45,483
Do you know him?

143
00:07:45,483 --> 00:07:46,920
Yes!

144
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,505
What kind of grave mistake did he make

145
00:07:48,505 --> 00:07:50,646
that caused you to run across classrooms and look for him yourselves?

146
00:07:50,646 --> 00:07:54,192
Jina! He says that he's Lee Seungmin's friend!

147
00:07:54,945 --> 00:07:56,729
Whoa.

148
00:07:56,729 --> 00:07:58,767
Goddess Jina?

149
00:08:01,221 --> 00:08:02,796
Hey!

150
00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:05,013
Do you know who is looking for you right now?

151
00:08:05,013 --> 00:08:06,135
Who?

152
00:08:06,135 --> 00:08:07,027
Don't be surprised.

153
00:08:07,027 --> 00:08:09,974
It's... it's... it's...

154
00:08:25,354 --> 00:08:28,028
 I didn't realize even then. 

155
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:34,808
 That I'd be called into the world of Oh Jina, 

156
00:08:36,071 --> 00:08:39,211
 a world that seemed so far away. 

157
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,260
Lee Seungmin?

158
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,085
Yes?

159
00:08:42,085 --> 00:08:44,245
I have a favor to ask you.

160
00:08:45,235 --> 00:08:47,328
From me?

161
00:08:49,322 --> 00:08:52,189
I need you to be my boyfriend.

162
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:55,990
♫   I'm curious what you keep glancing at   ♫

163
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:59,850
♫   You don't even know you're mesmerized by me   ♫

164
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:04,480
♫   Honestly I'm a little bored of these gazes. It's difficult for me   ♫

165
00:09:06,973 --> 00:09:08,515
    
 You're Lee Seungmin?  

166
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:10,259
  You didn't forget about introducing me to your new boyfriend, right?  

167
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:11,224
  Of course not.   

168
00:09:11,224 --> 00:09:14,260
  What are you doing, Lee Seungmin? Come on out.  

169
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,365
  Why are you alone?  

170
00:09:15,365 --> 00:09:16,946
  Where is your new boyfriend?  

171
00:09:16,946 --> 00:09:18,488
  He's going to be here soon.  

172
00:09:18,488 --> 00:09:20,562
  If he doesn't get here in a minute,  

173
00:09:20,562 --> 00:09:22,930
  then we're dating again, okay?  

174
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:25,880
♫   I'm just from another, another world   ♫

175
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:30,840
♫   So I coolly, so I act like myself   ♫

176
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,800
