1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,145
If you don't believe me, I'll show you.

2
00:00:03,145 --> 00:00:05,112
Watch closely.

3
00:00:22,236 --> 00:00:24,472
You still don't believe me?

4
00:00:28,238 --> 00:00:31,766
Hey, what are you staring at? Shouldn't you be practicing?

5
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:41,070


6
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:49,527
He's gone.

7
00:00:49,527 --> 00:00:51,710
What was that?

8
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,660
Oh... he kept doubting us.

9
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,340
Was that kiss real?

10
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,916
- Huh?
- Did you kiss me because you like me?

11
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:03,078
Oh... No, it's not that, but...

12
00:01:05,337 --> 00:01:07,811
This is driving me nuts.

13
00:01:07,811 --> 00:01:10,394
- You're crazy.
- What happened?

14
00:01:10,394 --> 00:01:13,409
Lower your voices. They can hear you.

15
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:14,578
Why did you kiss him all of a sudden?

16
00:01:14,578 --> 00:01:19,647
Koo Hyungtak kept doubting me, so I just did it spontaneously. I didn't mean it.

17
00:01:19,647 --> 00:01:23,023
Whew... I don't know what to do.

18
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,460
   

19
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,800
   

20
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:48,720
   

21
00:02:04,392 --> 00:02:07,256
I won't stand by anymore.

22
00:02:07,986 --> 00:02:13,344
    
 (T/N: "Physical Activity Promotion System" Day, similar to Fitness Challenge day in the U.S.) 

23
00:02:13,344 --> 00:02:16,112
Is this the best you can do?

24
00:02:18,437 --> 00:02:21,125
Hanna, are you OK?

25
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:23,377
That's it! Go on in.

26
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:27,946
Now from numbers 4 to 6. Face down.

27
00:02:27,946 --> 00:02:29,996
Hold on to this for me.

28
00:02:32,645 --> 00:02:34,585
I don't want to.

29
00:02:35,801 --> 00:02:38,121
That's too bad.

30
00:02:48,471 --> 00:02:52,206
Get ready. And go!

31
00:02:58,279 --> 00:03:01,820
79, there you go. 80.

32
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,616
81. A bit more.

33
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:06,014
82. Good!

34
00:03:06,014 --> 00:03:08,742
83, you're done!

35
00:03:08,742 --> 00:03:13,968
Koo Hyungtak, you have the highest record with 83 at Hwayang High.

36
00:03:15,512 --> 00:03:18,200
A round of applause.

37
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:23,161
- Did you see that?
- Yeah.

38
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,164
Wasn't it cool?

39
00:03:36,624 --> 00:03:40,016
We can't let this good opportunity go to waste. Not with the entire school watching.

40
00:03:40,016 --> 00:03:43,784
Buddy! Care to help?

41
00:03:43,784 --> 00:03:45,586
Can we spread stuff around like this?

42
00:03:45,586 --> 00:03:50,345
What's wrong with some fliers about an after-school club? Come on~

43
00:03:50,345 --> 00:03:53,404
You can become a TikToker, too. Those of you who want to become celebs,

44
00:03:53,404 --> 00:03:56,241
please join our TikTok club. Let's go!

45
00:03:56,241 --> 00:03:58,850
- TikTok! TikTok! TikTok! TikTok!
- It's OK.

46
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:01,480
TikTok! TikTok! TikTok! TikTok!

47
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,280
TikTok! TikTok! TikTok! TikTok!

48
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,818
On the floor. Again!

49
00:04:07,818 --> 00:04:10,064
Do you like TikTok?

50
00:04:10,064 --> 00:04:11,910
TikTok?

51
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,429
Would you like TikTok?

52
00:04:16,353 --> 00:04:19,494
- For real.
- Do you like TikTok?

53
00:04:19,494 --> 00:04:21,769
TikTok? Totally!

54
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:23,819
TikTok Club? Can I join, too?

55
00:04:23,819 --> 00:04:27,614
Of course. We'd be thankful. Besides myself, we have 0 club members.

56
00:04:27,614 --> 00:04:29,289
- Then let's take one now!
- Now?

57
00:04:29,289 --> 00:04:31,790
- Yeah!
- It's easy. This is all you have to do.

58
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:34,327
- Like this?
- Yeah.

59
00:04:34,327 --> 00:04:38,110
You can join later. Let's go get something to eat first.

60
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:42,117
You can call your friend along.

61
00:04:42,117 --> 00:04:45,528
Yes! Hey, Lee Seungmin!

62
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,383
Yum~

63
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:57,052
Our instructor is all good, but she has no common sense.

64
00:04:57,052 --> 00:05:00,064
Everyone knows you shouldn't weigh yourself after eating lunch.

65
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:03,767
Should I have skipped lunch like Hanna?

66
00:05:03,767 --> 00:05:07,137
Why isn't Lee Seungmin eating lunch?

67
00:05:07,137 --> 00:05:09,536
He said he had to go to the broadcast room.

68
00:05:11,823 --> 00:05:15,816
Oh, yeah! I saw that you pressed like on my Instagram posting.

69
00:05:16,707 --> 00:05:19,599
- What?
- Are you spying on my Instagram?

70
00:05:21,037 --> 00:05:25,620
No, it's not spying...

71
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,935
I'm a fan of you because you're so pretty.

72
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:30,965
Come on. I just look nice because of the filter~

73
00:05:30,965 --> 00:05:34,535
No, you look exactly the same as the pictures with filters.

74
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:37,740
What filter is this? Snow X?

75
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,175
- SoX?
- Come on~

76
00:05:40,175 --> 00:05:42,509
Don't~

77
00:05:43,815 --> 00:05:45,901
Hey, Oh Ba!

78
00:05:46,707 --> 00:05:50,617
I can't believe I'm saying this to you, but

79
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:52,932
give me some advice.

80
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,590
How many days have you gone without eating?

81
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,292
Three days.

82
00:06:14,292 --> 00:06:17,542
Do you want some water?

83
00:06:17,542 --> 00:06:20,597
I just barely got to 44.7 kg.

84
00:06:20,597 --> 00:06:24,153
If I drink water, I'll go over 45 kg.

85
00:06:24,153 --> 00:06:28,299
Why is that so important to you?

86
00:06:28,299 --> 00:06:31,278
Yeah. Why?

87
00:06:31,278 --> 00:06:33,540
Are you going to ask why I care about how much I weigh?

88
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,908
And tell me that all that matters is what's inside?

89
00:06:36,908 --> 00:06:39,180
How can I say that to you?

90
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,706
Everyone has different standards in life.

91
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,965
It's easy to know. The reason Lee Seungmin got angry.

92
00:06:47,965 --> 00:06:51,483
- What is it?
-You did everything that he hates.

93
00:06:51,483 --> 00:06:52,740
First, kissing just to show someone.

94
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,688
 If you can't believe me, I'll show you. 

95
00:06:54,688 --> 00:06:56,237
Second, kissing without meaning it.

96
00:06:56,237 --> 00:06:58,442
 Did you mean that kiss? 

97
00:06:58,442 --> 00:07:01,123
Third, that happened to be his first kiss.

98
00:07:01,123 --> 00:07:02,805
 Now do you believe me? 

99
00:07:02,805 --> 00:07:06,630
It was inconsiderate and insincere.

100
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:11,621
Everything about it was a lie.

101
00:07:11,621 --> 00:07:15,064
Wow! That was harsh.

102
00:07:15,064 --> 00:07:17,401
But, as his best friend,

103
00:07:17,401 --> 00:07:20,140
I think this is what really ticked him off.

104
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,773
The second one.

105
00:07:22,773 --> 00:07:24,935
- Kissing without meaning it? 
 - Yes!

106
00:07:24,935 --> 00:07:27,714
He always puts sincerity first.

107
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:29,480
It's like he worships it.

108
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,536
Then, is that why he refused when I asked him to pretend to date me?

109
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:35,489
- Because it's not real? 
 - That's right.

110
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:39,342
You're so smart.

111
00:07:39,342 --> 00:07:42,183
But why did he suddenly change his mind?

112
00:07:42,183 --> 00:07:45,124
Because what he feels is real.

113
00:07:45,124 --> 00:07:49,384
- Huh? 
 - He thought that it would be okay as long as he really liked you so...

114
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:55,132
Whoa. That was supposed to be a secret.

115
00:07:55,132 --> 00:07:57,346
Hold on.

116
00:07:57,346 --> 00:08:01,096
Then do you mean that he's always liked me?

117
00:08:01,096 --> 00:08:05,194
Yes, and since a long, long time ago.

118
00:08:12,418 --> 00:08:17,034
Drink right after you weigh yourself. You might get dehydrated.

119
00:08:18,114 --> 00:08:20,565
Oh... thanks.

120
00:08:20,565 --> 00:08:22,957
You're really amazing.

121
00:08:22,957 --> 00:08:24,038
What?

122
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:27,512
Trying that hard to maintain yourself.

123
00:08:27,512 --> 00:08:32,024
Other people say that I'm going overboard...

124
00:08:32,024 --> 00:08:35,400
Why is that going overboard? You're protecting what you think is important.

125
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,424
That's cool.

126
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,811
That sounds like you think I should starve longer.

127
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:43,215
I'm just saying that you should cheer up.

128
00:08:43,215 --> 00:08:46,099
Oh, but don't starve anymore. You'll hurt yourself.

129
00:08:46,099 --> 00:08:48,659
OK. You, too. Cheer up.

130
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:51,442
Me? Why?

131
00:08:51,442 --> 00:08:53,086
I'm sure you're going through a hard time, too.

132
00:08:53,086 --> 00:08:57,203
You have to pretend that you're someone's boyfriend even if you don't like her.

133
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,959
Oh that's...

134
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,516
Hanna! There you are!

135
00:09:02,516 --> 00:09:04,478
I've been looking for you everywhere.

136
00:09:04,478 --> 00:09:07,787
- Come on, it's our turn. 
 - Yeah.

137
00:09:21,052 --> 00:09:22,435
I heard everything.

138
00:09:22,435 --> 00:09:25,220
I heard that you always liked me.

139
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,875
What?

140
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:31,192
I remember our contract saying that you shouldn't have indecent feelings.

141
00:09:32,928 --> 00:09:35,849
It's not indecent. It's real.

142
00:09:35,849 --> 00:09:38,026
That's not allowed either?

143
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:42,868
Why did you like me, and how long have you liked me?

144
00:09:42,868 --> 00:09:47,105
I fell for you because you looked so amazing singing.

145
00:09:47,105 --> 00:09:50,579
And I thought you looked pretty after that.

146
00:09:50,579 --> 00:09:53,301
When I was singing?

147
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:57,040
In March, in the broadcast room.

148
00:10:06,053 --> 00:10:08,526
Are you finished?

149
00:10:09,523 --> 00:10:11,659
One more thing.

150
00:10:11,659 --> 00:10:13,618
Go ahead.

151
00:10:14,723 --> 00:10:16,536
Earlier,

152
00:10:18,628 --> 00:10:21,980
kissing you like that.

153
00:10:23,148 --> 00:10:27,350
I'm really sorry. I really regret doing that.

154
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:36,035
If you're really sorry,

155
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:41,920
take it back and do it for real later.

156
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,234
Sincerely.

157
00:11:03,255 --> 00:11:04,936
 Take it back 

158
00:11:04,936 --> 00:11:07,530
 and do it for real later. 

159
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:10,462
 And do it for real later. 

160
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:12,965
 Do it for real later. 

161
00:11:15,148 --> 00:11:16,656
What's wrong with this?

162
00:11:16,656 --> 00:11:19,757
- What? 
 - Is it broken again?

163
00:11:19,757 --> 00:11:22,451
I think this is broken.

164
00:11:22,451 --> 00:11:25,063
Do you have high blood pressure? Or arrhythmia?

00:11:25,063 --> 00:11:27,804
Why is your heart beating so fast?

00:11:28,676 --> 00:11:31,752
My precious student...

167
00:11:32,632 --> 00:11:35,188
Get on my back!

00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:39,140
We have no time to lose. Hurry!

174
00:11:59,098 --> 00:12:02,050
  - What do you want to drink? It's on me. 
 - What is this?
