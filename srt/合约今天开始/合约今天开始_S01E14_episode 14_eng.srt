1
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:07,598
   

2
00:00:11,367 --> 00:00:12,992
You surprised me.

3
00:00:12,992 --> 00:00:15,097
Let's play hooky today.

4
00:00:15,097 --> 00:00:17,072
Hooky?

5
00:00:17,072 --> 00:00:18,625
No, I can't.

6
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:19,710
Come on.

7
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,447
No.

8
00:00:21,447 --> 00:00:22,847
Come on.

9
00:00:22,847 --> 00:00:25,082
I can't do that.

10
00:00:25,082 --> 00:00:28,316
Oh... I shouldn't do this.

11
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:40,450
By the way, where are we going?

12
00:00:41,627 --> 00:00:43,372
Well...

13
00:00:43,372 --> 00:00:46,109
is there anything we've never done before as a couple?

14
00:00:53,615 --> 00:00:56,265
- No.
- Give me that!

15
00:00:58,709 --> 00:00:59,868
You need to eat them one by one.

16
00:00:59,868 --> 00:01:00,733
Give me that!

17
00:01:00,733 --> 00:01:02,696
- No.
 - Hey!

18
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:03,246
I won't.

19
00:01:03,246 --> 00:01:05,556
- Give me that. Hurry up.
- I won't.

20
00:01:21,885 --> 00:01:23,147
What's this?

21
00:01:23,147 --> 00:01:24,906
What? It came out very well.

22
00:01:24,906 --> 00:01:27,276
Take a better one!

23
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:38,790
♫   I won't hide you   ♫

24
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,390
♫  Look at me   ♫

25
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:52,440
♫  I want to stay by your side. I want to tell you   ♫

26
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,790
♫  Even if you can't see me   ♫

27
00:02:04,245 --> 00:02:05,790
What's wrong? Are you sick?

28
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,195
What's wrong?

29
00:02:07,195 --> 00:02:08,755
When I see you...

30
00:02:08,755 --> 00:02:10,227
my... breath...

31
00:02:10,227 --> 00:02:10,927
Breath?

32
00:02:10,927 --> 00:02:12,023
Breath!

33
00:02:12,023 --> 00:02:13,003
Breath?

34
00:02:13,003 --> 00:02:15,523
I'm made breathless by your beauty.

35
00:02:18,152 --> 00:02:20,011
Oh, silly.

36
00:02:20,011 --> 00:02:23,920
I told you to have your inhaler when you're with me!

37
00:02:24,634 --> 00:02:26,163
This is the only way.

38
00:02:26,163 --> 00:02:28,505
I should do mouth-to-mouth on you.

39
00:02:28,505 --> 00:02:29,930
Mouth-to-mouth?

40
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,546
My girlfriend is so amazing.

41
00:02:31,546 --> 00:02:34,404
Do it right now! Now!

42
00:02:44,452 --> 00:02:46,810
What's wrong?

43
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,560
As if you saw a ghost.

44
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:52,915
Why are you lying there?

45
00:02:55,035 --> 00:02:57,828
I was about to get mouth-to-mouth.

46
00:02:57,828 --> 00:02:59,778
Hanna, are you okay?

47
00:02:59,778 --> 00:03:01,433
Is everything okay?

48
00:03:01,433 --> 00:03:02,532
Yes.

49
00:03:02,532 --> 00:03:04,998
I haven't seen Jina today.

50
00:03:04,998 --> 00:03:08,033
I don't know. I couldn't reach her today.

51
00:03:08,033 --> 00:03:10,947
What about Seungmin? Did you see him today?

52
00:03:10,947 --> 00:03:14,767
No. He said he had something to do.

53
00:03:15,485 --> 00:03:18,305
I guess they're together.

54
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,548
   

55
00:03:42,575 --> 00:03:44,130
"Tiger Sister"?

56
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,470
Do you read this kind of book?

57
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:48,760
Of course. This is my all time favorite.

58
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,441
"I want to eat your appendix"?

59
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:53,870
I'm not into these sentimental novels...

60
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,445
Do we have to switch our books and read?

61
00:04:02,445 --> 00:04:05,520
It's fun. We will learn about each other's preferences.

62
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,642
This kid will die on the next page.

63
00:04:16,642 --> 00:04:19,312
Hey, no spoilers.

64
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:26,502
In the next book, this one will betray that one.

65
00:04:26,502 --> 00:04:29,300
Oh, seriously.

66
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,030
It's fun to read each other's books.

67
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:35,261
But why aren't you reading this one?

68
00:04:35,261 --> 00:04:36,605
I've read it all.

69
00:04:36,605 --> 00:04:38,525
Already? Don't lie.

70
00:04:38,525 --> 00:04:41,095
I did.

71
00:04:41,095 --> 00:04:43,548
What happened to the main characters?

72
00:04:43,548 --> 00:04:46,428
They break up in the end.

73
00:04:46,428 --> 00:04:48,233
Oh, you really read it!

74
00:04:48,233 --> 00:04:49,953
How was it? Isn't it fun?

75
00:04:49,953 --> 00:04:51,865
No.

76
00:04:51,865 --> 00:04:53,370
I don't like such things.

77
00:05:11,775 --> 00:05:16,420
You... look better today.

78
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:21,040
Jina and Seungmin's contract relationship will be over today.

79
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,210
Will they really end it?

80
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:26,210
Yes. I asked Jina to end it.

81
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:30,210
Are you sure you asked? Not threatened her?

82
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:33,655
Anyway. Do your best to capture Jina's heart...

83
00:05:33,655 --> 00:05:37,790
so that I can have a chance with Seungmin.

84
00:05:48,046 --> 00:05:49,505
Playing hooky and having a date was a nice idea!

85
00:05:49,505 --> 00:05:51,807
Let's do this once every week.

86
00:05:51,807 --> 00:05:52,691
No.

87
00:05:52,691 --> 00:05:53,871
Is that too frequent?

88
00:05:53,871 --> 00:05:56,183
What about once a month?

89
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,473
What?

90
00:05:58,473 --> 00:06:00,780
Is that too frequent?

91
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,425
There will be no more.

92
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,364
Yes?

93
00:06:13,075 --> 00:06:15,895
Are you here? I'll go pick it up.

94
00:06:15,895 --> 00:06:16,760
Arrived?

95
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,615
Yes.

96
00:06:17,615 --> 00:06:20,324
Stay here. I'll pick it up.

97
00:06:27,355 --> 00:06:32,325
  
Are you on a date today? 

98
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:50,126
Hello?

99
00:06:50,126 --> 00:06:53,077
 Oh, I'm glad you picked up. Is this Lee Seungmin? 

100
00:06:53,077 --> 00:06:54,997
He's not here.

101
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:57,578
 This is the community service center in Hwayang-dong. 

102
00:06:57,578 --> 00:06:58,991
Hwayang-dong?

103
00:06:58,991 --> 00:07:00,556
 Yes! This is to notify you 

104
00:07:00,556 --> 00:07:04,739
 that the traffic light is fixed on Hwayang-dong Street 13. 

105
00:07:04,739 --> 00:07:07,221
Hwayang-dong Street 13?

106
00:07:07,221 --> 00:07:08,403
That's in front of my house.

107
00:07:08,403 --> 00:07:09,699
 Yeah, there! 

108
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:11,584
 He kept asking us to fix it. 

109
00:07:11,584 --> 00:07:13,999
 He called several times every day. 

110
00:07:13,999 --> 00:07:17,192
 It gave me a headache! 

111
00:07:17,192 --> 00:07:19,755
 How long has that been out of order? 

112
00:07:19,755 --> 00:07:21,503
 It could be dangerous. 

113
00:07:21,503 --> 00:07:23,482
 Don't you need to call the community service center? 

114
00:07:23,482 --> 00:07:24,362
 To fix it. 

115
00:07:24,362 --> 00:07:26,431
 Forget it. 

116
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,727
 Hello? 

117
00:07:29,727 --> 00:07:30,377
Yes.

118
00:07:30,377 --> 00:07:34,066
 Anyway, it's fixed now. Please be assured 

119
00:07:34,066 --> 00:07:35,963
 and never call us again! 

120
00:07:35,963 --> 00:07:37,549
Oh, okay.

121
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:22,070
Do your best to capture Jina's heart...

122
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:26,146
so that I can have a chance with Seungmin.

123
00:08:27,895 --> 00:08:33,470
Well, do you like Seungmin or...

124
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:35,930
do you want to win against Jina?

125
00:08:38,368 --> 00:08:40,905
Both.

126
00:08:40,905 --> 00:08:44,605
Well, Seungmin is another issue.

127
00:08:44,605 --> 00:08:47,170
But why do you want to win against her so much?

128
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:50,245
I think you can understand it.

129
00:08:50,245 --> 00:08:52,748
Rivalry. You know how it feels.

130
00:08:52,748 --> 00:08:54,860
I'm sure you're familiar with it.

131
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,010
I don't know.

132
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:02,661
Even so, I haven't tried to win against my friend.

133
00:09:03,757 --> 00:09:07,957
I guess Jina was the only one who thought you guys were friends.

134
00:09:10,969 --> 00:09:13,067
Aren't you going to go for a run?

135
00:09:14,678 --> 00:09:16,843
I was just about to.

136
00:09:16,843 --> 00:09:18,953
See you.

137
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,535
You must be kidding.

138
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:43,930
We did a lot today, right?

139
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:45,950
True.

140
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:50,970
Shall we sit here?

141
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:52,701
Okay.

142
00:10:21,846 --> 00:10:24,805
Time flies so fast.

143
00:10:24,805 --> 00:10:27,465
Today is already the 50th day.

144
00:10:27,465 --> 00:10:29,780
Right.

145
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:33,047
How was it for you? All this?

146
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:38,330
It was fun.

147
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:43,122
Thanks to you, I learned that kimchi fried rice at internet cafés is delicious.

148
00:10:44,135 --> 00:10:47,944
And since you put this hoodie on me, I didn't catch a cold.

149
00:10:50,335 --> 00:10:56,801
For the first time, I stayed up all night with a boy at my place.

150
00:10:56,801 --> 00:10:59,765
We traveled together.

151
00:10:59,765 --> 00:11:02,345
We held hands, studied together.

152
00:11:06,025 --> 00:11:08,930
Anyway, everything was so nice, but—

153
00:11:10,867 --> 00:11:14,770
   

154
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,825
We'll have more fun from now on.

155
00:11:21,825 --> 00:11:23,645
Here.

156
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:29,175
The contract is over.

157
00:11:29,925 --> 00:11:32,525
- So.
- So!

158
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,540
There's no reason to take your hand now.

159
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:44,600
Thanks for everything, Seungmin.

160
00:11:48,087 --> 00:11:50,794
What do you mean?

161
00:11:54,174 --> 00:11:55,414
I want to go alone.

162
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:57,698
You don't need to walk me home.

163
00:11:59,265 --> 00:12:02,540
Is this the end? Like this?

164
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:06,495
Didn't we like each other?

165
00:12:06,495 --> 00:12:09,730
The contract was valid until today, silly.

166
00:12:13,849 --> 00:12:15,923
I should go.

167
00:12:16,607 --> 00:12:18,382
Sorry.

168
00:12:26,842 --> 00:12:29,273
Stop following me!

169
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:05,990


170
00:13:10,295 --> 00:13:12,955
  One thing has changed. 
    

171
00:13:12,955 --> 00:13:16,090
 Jina is not in my life. 

172
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:22,760
 What's going on 

173
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,137
 between you two? 

174
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:27,042
 We broke up. 

175
00:13:27,042 --> 00:13:28,710
 I heard you broke up with Seungmin. 

176
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:29,585
 Are you okay? 

177
00:13:29,585 --> 00:13:31,219
 Are you here to comfort me? 

178
00:13:31,219 --> 00:13:34,630
 Hanna, what do you think a friend is? 

179
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:44,000
