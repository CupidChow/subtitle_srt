1
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,040
Things don't always work out.

2
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,360
Don't mind it too much.

3
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:32,746
     

4
00:00:32,746 --> 00:00:36,910
I know you've been working hard to prepare for the monthly evaluation.

5
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:38,868
First...

6
00:00:38,868 --> 00:00:40,796
Sung Hanna?

7
00:00:40,796 --> 00:00:43,033
Generally,

8
00:00:43,033 --> 00:00:45,911
you looked like an amateur.

9
00:00:45,911 --> 00:00:48,325
The entire song was flat-toned.

10
00:00:48,325 --> 00:00:50,435
Your dance didn't have any strength.

11
00:00:50,435 --> 00:00:53,157
It's a total disaster.

12
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,140
Nobody would think you've been a trainee for six years.

13
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,400
I'll work harder next time.

14
00:01:03,725 --> 00:01:05,005
Sigh...

15
00:01:05,005 --> 00:01:09,910
  I don't think it's about working harder.  

16
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:12,065
Anyway, you tried.

17
00:01:12,065 --> 00:01:13,960
Thank you.

18
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,560
And Oh Jina.

19
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,310
Yes.

20
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:21,319
How long did you practice?

21
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:24,765
Um...

22
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,480
Don't be nervous.

23
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,745
I asked so I could compliment you.

24
00:01:29,745 --> 00:01:32,075
Just how much practice does it take for someone to get this good?

25
00:01:32,075 --> 00:01:34,095
You're improving so fast that it scares me.

26
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:36,995
Have you really been a trainee for just four years?

27
00:01:36,995 --> 00:01:39,464
I got goosebumps listening to your singing.

28
00:01:39,464 --> 00:01:41,509
Wow.

29
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:42,936
Thank you.

30
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,100
Everyone,

31
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,501
just try to be like Jina.

32
00:01:46,501 --> 00:01:48,013
Got it?

33
00:01:48,013 --> 00:01:50,194
Yes...

34
00:01:51,515 --> 00:01:53,595
Congratulations.

35
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,530
No.

36
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,780
You were good, too, for real.

37
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,890
 Ji Hyunji. 

38
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:04,960
 I don't mean to be harsh, but... 

39
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,195
Hanna!

40
00:02:21,346 --> 00:02:22,221
Oh...

41
00:02:22,221 --> 00:02:23,579
Where did it go?

42
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:24,811
Are you looking for something?

43
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,231
My earphones.

44
00:02:26,231 --> 00:02:28,376
I always put them here. There's no way I would've lost them.

45
00:02:28,376 --> 00:02:30,145
Yeah, that's weird.

46
00:02:30,145 --> 00:02:32,190
Why are you the only one losing things these days?

47
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,390
Oh...

48
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,455
Jina.

49
00:02:34,455 --> 00:02:36,754
Lee Seungmin wants to see you.

50
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,190
Why?

51
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,725
I'm here to give you this.

52
00:02:54,725 --> 00:02:56,738
What's that?

53
00:02:57,681 --> 00:02:59,911
Clause 9. Wear a couple item.

54
00:02:59,911 --> 00:03:01,190
Since we've been together for 22 days,

55
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,780
this is my gift.

56
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,901
Wow...

57
00:03:03,901 --> 00:03:06,251
We're not kids. Who celebrates the 22nd day?

58
00:03:06,251 --> 00:03:07,451
We're still kids.

59
00:03:07,451 --> 00:03:09,426
We need to celebrate these while we can.

60
00:03:09,426 --> 00:03:10,637
Hmm...

61
00:03:10,637 --> 00:03:12,931
Really...

62
00:03:12,931 --> 00:03:14,559
Wow.

63
00:03:14,559 --> 00:03:17,081
It's a backpack called ROOF.

64
00:03:17,081 --> 00:03:19,800
I thought it would look good on you.

65
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,200
I heard it's famous for being

66
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,025
a couple item with HOOK backpack.

67
00:03:24,025 --> 00:03:25,125
And it turns out

68
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:28,645
that I have HOOK.

69
00:03:28,645 --> 00:03:31,424
I'll take it since I can't just ignore your gift.

70
00:03:31,424 --> 00:03:32,913
But...

71
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:34,608
let me pay for dinner today.

72
00:03:34,608 --> 00:03:36,432
Think about what you want to eat.

73
00:03:36,432 --> 00:03:38,215
Okay!

74
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,103
What?

75
00:03:42,103 --> 00:03:44,154
What is it?

76
00:03:45,805 --> 00:03:46,466
Gosh.

77
00:03:46,466 --> 00:03:49,171
Why is he so childish?

78
00:03:51,014 --> 00:03:54,057
I love it.

79
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,000
What is it? Is it a blanket?

80
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,480
Wow.

81
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,510
It's so soft.

82
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:01,910
Wow.

83
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,725
What's this for?

84
00:04:03,725 --> 00:04:05,375
I don't know.

85
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,961
He just said it's to celebrate our 22nd day together.

86
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:11,535
Is he an anniversary addict or what?

87
00:04:11,535 --> 00:04:14,430
Lee Seungmin.

88
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,400
I really like your backpack.

89
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,402
Right?

90
00:04:19,294 --> 00:04:24,002
     

91
00:04:26,017 --> 00:04:27,180
I'm sorry.

92
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,106
My practice ended late.

93
00:04:30,106 --> 00:04:32,480
Since when have you been waiting?

94
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,580
3 PM.

95
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,135
I told you I wasn't sure when practice would end.

96
00:04:37,135 --> 00:04:40,115
Why'd you wait? It must've been difficult.

97
00:04:43,447 --> 00:04:45,869
What is this?

98
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,290
Be honored.

99
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:50,795
That you've been dating me for 100 days.

100
00:04:50,795 --> 00:04:53,747
Oh, right, 100 days anniversary.

101
00:04:55,192 --> 00:04:56,979
I'm really sorry,

102
00:04:56,979 --> 00:05:00,039
but I have to have dinner with the baseball club members today.

103
00:05:00,971 --> 00:05:02,211
That works fine.

104
00:05:02,211 --> 00:05:05,743
I need to go practice anyway.

105
00:05:05,743 --> 00:05:07,925
See you later.

106
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:16,633
Ha...

107
00:05:31,863 --> 00:05:33,905
What is this?

108
00:05:38,914 --> 00:05:44,723
    

109
00:05:58,946 --> 00:06:01,472
     

110
00:06:04,505 --> 00:06:06,620
Welcome to TikTak club.

111
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,720
Round of applause.

112
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,613
Yay.

113
00:06:10,613 --> 00:06:13,552
I will do my best and assist Bawool

114
00:06:13,552 --> 00:06:14,749
to make great TikTak clips so that our club

115
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,222
becomes the best club in Hwayang High!

116
00:06:16,222 --> 00:06:18,422
Thank you.

117
00:06:20,075 --> 00:06:23,167
So, do we make TikTak clips here?

118
00:06:23,167 --> 00:06:24,792
And we've got the school's permission?

119
00:06:24,792 --> 00:06:25,459
Hey.

120
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:27,036
Of course they didn't at first.

121
00:06:27,036 --> 00:06:30,178
But this king-god-general-emperor-Bawool made it possible in the end.

122
00:06:30,178 --> 00:06:31,953
And the tarot club got disbanded when I wanted to start this club too.

123
00:06:31,953 --> 00:06:35,440
     

124
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,980
So clumsy.

125
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,390
Hey!

126
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,341
The sausage bread is mine!

127
00:06:53,341 --> 00:06:55,807
Spit it out!

128
00:06:58,102 --> 00:07:00,082
You...

129
00:07:00,082 --> 00:07:01,404
How dare you touch him?

130
00:07:01,404 --> 00:07:02,774
Huh?

131
00:07:02,774 --> 00:07:03,619
May I...

132
00:07:03,619 --> 00:07:04,746
slightly hit...

133
00:07:04,746 --> 00:07:05,757
the back of Lee Seungmin's head?

134
00:07:05,757 --> 00:07:07,487
No.

135
00:07:07,487 --> 00:07:08,275
Hey.

136
00:07:08,275 --> 00:07:12,805
Don't be too harsh on him.

137
00:07:12,805 --> 00:07:15,255
Will there be a lot of people at Hongdae?

138
00:07:15,255 --> 00:07:16,320
Hongdae?

139
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,590
What about Hongdae?

140
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:20,431
I want to go to Namgung Jungah's fan signing event.

141
00:07:20,431 --> 00:07:21,991
Namgung Jungah?

142
00:07:21,991 --> 00:07:23,271
Who is Namgung Jungah?

143
00:07:23,271 --> 00:07:24,746
Do you like Namgung Jungah?

144
00:07:24,746 --> 00:07:25,760
Yes, totally.

145
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,798
You like her, too?

146
00:07:26,798 --> 00:07:28,038
- Yes, especially...
- "Cat"?

147
00:07:28,038 --> 00:07:29,091
So you know it!

148
00:07:29,091 --> 00:07:30,393
Isn't it such a great song?

149
00:07:30,393 --> 00:07:32,421
Yes, it's my favorite song, too.

150
00:07:32,421 --> 00:07:33,365
How interesting.

151
00:07:33,365 --> 00:07:35,065
Not many people know Namgung Jungah.

152
00:07:35,065 --> 00:07:36,190
I know.

153
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:38,147
I guess we connected.

154
00:07:38,147 --> 00:07:39,265
Lee Seungmin.

155
00:07:39,265 --> 00:07:41,210
Our homeroom teacher wants to see us.

156
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,225
Now?

157
00:07:42,225 --> 00:07:43,691
Why?

158
00:07:43,691 --> 00:07:45,053
How do I know?

159
00:07:45,053 --> 00:07:46,423
Let's go.

160
00:07:46,423 --> 00:07:47,078
Member Ju Minji.

161
00:07:47,078 --> 00:07:48,855
Please take good care of our TikTak club!

162
00:07:48,855 --> 00:07:50,274
Yes, President Oh Bawool!

163
00:07:50,274 --> 00:07:51,479
Take care!

164
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:52,648
- Salute! 
 - I have to go.

165
00:07:52,648 --> 00:07:53,669
I'll see you later.

166
00:07:53,669 --> 00:07:55,512
- Okay. 
 - Let's go.

167
00:07:55,512 --> 00:07:57,132
Bye.

168
00:07:57,132 --> 00:07:59,431
Bye.

169
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,976
Namgung Jungah?

170
00:08:01,976 --> 00:08:04,182
Since when did you like her?

171
00:08:04,182 --> 00:08:07,248
Yes, her songs are my "hidden masterpiece songs."

172
00:08:07,248 --> 00:08:09,768
Since when did you get close to Seungmin?

173
00:08:09,768 --> 00:08:11,208
You didn't like him at first.

174
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:12,183
I just

175
00:08:12,183 --> 00:08:16,069
thought he's a good person as I spent more time with him.

176
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:18,170
That's true.

177
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,600
Jina.

178
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,132
Do you really

179
00:08:22,132 --> 00:08:25,287
like him?

180
00:08:25,287 --> 00:08:26,461
What?

181
00:08:26,461 --> 00:08:27,406
Hey!

182
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:30,511
You know we're just pretending to date.

183
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:33,130
You told me

184
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,998
it's just a contract between you two.

185
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,137
Why?

186
00:08:49,137 --> 00:08:51,507
I have a favor to ask.

187
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,140
I was going to go upstairs.

188
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,240
I don't think I can have dinner with you today.

189
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,330
I've got other matters to take care of.

190
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,760
What happened?

191
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,322
I'm not sure.

192
00:09:17,322 --> 00:09:18,955
But I think it's something important.

193
00:09:18,955 --> 00:09:20,315
It's about my agency.

194
00:09:20,315 --> 00:09:24,052
It's too bad. It's our first anniversary.

195
00:09:24,052 --> 00:09:26,137
It's okay.

196
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,130
I'll treat you with something tasty next time.

197
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:32,762
See you.

198
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:46,800
Where's Jina?

199
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,705
Huh?

200
00:09:48,705 --> 00:09:50,078
She has other plans.

201
00:09:50,078 --> 00:09:51,910
Oh...

202
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:55,105
Then maybe...

203
00:09:55,105 --> 00:09:58,130
do you want to go to Namgung Jungah's fan signing event with me?

204
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,700
Can I do that?

205
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,385
Sure.

206
00:10:00,385 --> 00:10:03,188
It would be boring if I go there by myself.

207
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,160
I got Namgung Jungah's autograph thanks to you.

208
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,296
Thank you so much.

209
00:10:12,296 --> 00:10:14,361
Then we can go there together next time, too.

210
00:10:14,361 --> 00:10:15,672
What do you want to drink? It's on me.

211
00:10:15,672 --> 00:10:18,113
- Okay. 
 - What's this?

212
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,920
♫  Ya, you know we’re so different  ♫

213
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,150
♫  I’m just the way I am  ♫

214
00:10:37,415 --> 00:10:38,419
     

215
00:10:38,419 --> 00:10:39,699
  This is not important right now.  

216
00:10:39,699 --> 00:10:40,895
  Even contract relationships are the same.  

217
00:10:40,895 --> 00:10:41,915
  They hurt.  

218
00:10:41,915 --> 00:10:43,560
  You don't deserve to be her boyfriend.  

219
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,950
  What do you mean?  

220
00:10:47,602 --> 00:10:49,536
  Oh Jina!  

221
00:10:58,714 --> 00:11:01,819
     

222
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:14,060
   

223
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,800
  Who is Namgung Jungah?
