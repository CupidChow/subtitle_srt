1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:08,060


2
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,153
No way.

3
00:00:11,153 --> 00:00:12,390
Is it you?

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,860
The person Hanna told me to meet?

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,260
What do you want to drink?

6
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,720
I don't think we're close enough to talk about

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,700
what to drink while we sit together. Am I wrong?

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,500
Just sit for a little while.

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,080
I'm not going to be

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,960
clingy to you today.

11
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,660
What's all this?

12
00:00:44,055 --> 00:00:45,280
I felt bad about not celebrating

13
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,700
our anniversaries and your birthday while we were going out.

14
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,300
I called you here to have a party to make up for those days.

15
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,260
So come on and smile a little.

16
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,049
This is my present for our 100th day together.

17
00:01:00,049 --> 00:01:02,800
And this is for our 200th day.

18
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,240
And this is for our 300th day.

19
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,890
And this

20
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,200
is for your birthday not too long ago.

21
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,549
Use this instead of

22
00:01:15,549 --> 00:01:17,478
earphones you have to plug in.

23
00:01:21,735 --> 00:01:25,760
There have been some weird things happening to our lockers.

24
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,680
Make sure you lock them up well.

25
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,340
Sure...

26
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,940
Thanks.

27
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,660
But I didn't want presents like this.

28
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,410
I just wanted for you to be there with me.

29
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,680
Then how about Lee Seungmin?

30
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:49,210
Is he always by your side?

31
00:01:50,306 --> 00:01:51,680
Yeah.

32
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,735
Thanks to you, I got the autograph of Namgung Jungah.

33
00:01:53,735 --> 00:01:56,080
- Thank you so much.
- Then we can go there together next time, too.

34
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,449
What do you want to drink? My treat.

35
00:01:57,449 --> 00:01:58,986
What's going on?

36
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,759
Is this the important thing

37
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,514
you had to take care of?

38
00:02:10,514 --> 00:02:12,012
Huh?

39
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,880
Yeah.

40
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,560
But why are you two together?

41
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,360
We went to Namgung Jungah's fan signing event.

42
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,000
The two of you?

43
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:30,470
I still have something left to say.

44
00:02:34,165 --> 00:02:36,270
I'll buy next time.

45
00:02:51,295 --> 00:02:52,365
Why did you leave like that?

46
00:02:52,365 --> 00:02:54,880
Then how should I have left?

47
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,360
I found out that Koo Hyungtak was here only after I got here.

48
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,520
Isn't that why you're upset?

49
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,160
Then how come you were with Hanna?

50
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,600
She told you earlier that we were at a fan signing event.

51
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,015
Why didn't you tell me?

52
00:03:05,015 --> 00:03:07,095
You told me that something important was going on, so I didn't want to bother you.

53
00:03:07,095 --> 00:03:08,341
But...

54
00:03:08,341 --> 00:03:09,927
that's not the important thing right now, is it?

55
00:03:09,927 --> 00:03:10,952
I...

56
00:03:10,952 --> 00:03:12,980
came here not knowing Koo Hyungtak would be here.

57
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,203
But you went along with Hanna by choice.

58
00:03:15,203 --> 00:03:18,440
I think I'm the person that should be upset here.

59
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,075
Am I wrong?

60
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:25,410
Where are you going?

61
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:28,710
Even contract relationships are the same as real relationships. They hurt just as much.

62
00:03:40,021 --> 00:03:41,467
Ow!

63
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,255
I'm sorry.

64
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,020
What about Jina?

65
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,020
She went.

66
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,800
You let her go like that?

67
00:04:10,725 --> 00:04:12,300
 My bracelet. 

68
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,675
 I definitely left it here. 

69
00:04:13,675 --> 00:04:14,680
  My earphones. 

70
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,856
 I always keep them here. Where could they have gone? 

71
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:18,698
 How come only your things keep disappearing? 

72
00:04:18,698 --> 00:04:20,590
 What's this? 

73
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,230
Why are you following me?

74
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,660
I told you.

75
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,220
That we're going to be together soon.

76
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,900
  
What's this? 

77
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,180
You're in our school baseball team, aren't you?

78
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,160
Thanks for recognizing me.

79
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:09,390
If you come any closer, I'm going to the police. Go on.

80
00:05:11,525 --> 00:05:13,465
I don't want to.

81
00:05:15,163 --> 00:05:16,629
What?

82
00:05:35,325 --> 00:05:37,385
She's not answering because she fought with me.

83
00:05:37,385 --> 00:05:40,955
- Don't worry too much...
- Why did you let her go like that?

84
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,720
Did you not hear anything from her?

85
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,860
What do you mean?

86
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:53,510
And she calls you her boyfriend...

87
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:56,050
What are you talking about?

88
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,780
Some weirdo keeps looking through her locker.

89
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,580
And he left a weird note in her locker a few days ago.

90
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,020
I think she's being stalked, you idiot!

91
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,620
And you let her go alone this late?

92
00:06:15,951 --> 00:06:19,736
 The person you are trying to reach is not available. Please leave a message after the beep. 

93
00:06:19,736 --> 00:06:21,051
     

94
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,460
Where are you?

95
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,565
A guy in your baseball team is following me.

96
00:06:27,565 --> 00:06:29,690
Let me tell you where I am...

97
00:06:30,382 --> 00:06:32,040
Hello?

98
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,940
Hello!

99
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,680
Jina!

100
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,520
Oh Jina!

101
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,100
Go toward her house.

102
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,922
I'll go toward her practice studio.

103
00:06:44,922 --> 00:06:46,460
Okay.

104
00:06:57,705 --> 00:07:00,405
Get lost, you crazy stalker.

105
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,120
Come on, you're upsetting me.

106
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,180
What do you mean, "crazy stalker"?

107
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:09,740
Be honest. You were attracted to me, too.

108
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,380
Am I wrong?

109
00:07:12,435 --> 00:07:14,230
Honestly, I've thought that you were

110
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,990
pretty for a while.

111
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,035
-  Jina.  
 -  Huh? 

112
00:07:17,035 --> 00:07:19,780
-  Happy birthday.  
-  Thank you! 

113
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,265
 I can't do this anymore. 

114
00:07:21,265 --> 00:07:22,600
 Are you going to let me off the hook now? 

115
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,606
 No. 

116
00:07:23,606 --> 00:07:25,240
 I'm breaking up with you now. 

117
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,700
 And then you just happened 

118
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:30,320
 to break up with Koo Hyungtak. Thankfully. 

119
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,545
 So that's when it started. 

120
00:07:37,545 --> 00:07:40,270
 My... pure love. 

121
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,445
 Ow. 

122
00:07:41,445 --> 00:07:43,299
 Are you okay? 

123
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,831
 Yeah... 

124
00:07:45,831 --> 00:07:47,723
 I'm okay. 

125
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,780
 And then we kept 

126
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:52,400
 bumping into each other like fate. 

127
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,110
 It was just a matter of time until you became mine. 

128
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,220
 I won't let you down next time. 

129
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,086
-  Okay?  
-  Jina. 

130
00:08:02,086 --> 00:08:03,562
 But... 

131
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,140
 Hello, I'm Jina's boyfriend, Lee Seungmin. 

132
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,220
 When some loser freshman comes along 

133
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,320
 and says that he's your boyfriend. 

134
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,440
 If you can't believe me, let me show you. 

135
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,885
 Watch. 

136
00:08:15,885 --> 00:08:17,785
 And you dared kiss him 

137
00:08:17,785 --> 00:08:20,560
 in front of me! 

138
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,720
Don't you think that would drive me insane? Huh?

139
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,140
Jina!

140
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,440
Where are you?

141
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,160
Oh Jina!

142
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,139
What does he have that I don't?

143
00:08:44,139 --> 00:08:47,030
Why can't it be me?

144
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:49,856
Just date me.

145
00:08:49,856 --> 00:08:51,293
Huh?

146
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,820
I'll make sure you're loved.

147
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:02,027
You're insane...

148
00:09:02,027 --> 00:09:03,815
Oh Jina!

149
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:12,900


150
00:09:15,605 --> 00:09:17,345
    
 What the heck do you think you're doing here?  

151
00:09:17,345 --> 00:09:18,425
  Hey, Lee Seungmin.  

152
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:19,576
  Make sure you get things right from now on.  

153
00:09:19,576 --> 00:09:21,460
  How long have you been friends with Hanna?  

154
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,680
  About four years?  

155
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,790
  I'm really grateful to her.  

156
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,830
  It's a relief that nothing bad happened...  

157
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,066
  Thank you...  

158
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,138
  for everything.  

159
00:09:28,138 --> 00:09:29,172
  If you want to thank me,  

160
00:09:29,172 --> 00:09:31,240
  you should give me a gift.  

161
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,225
     

162
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,600
