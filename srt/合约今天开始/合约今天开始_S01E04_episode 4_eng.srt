1
00:00:05,235 --> 00:00:07,735
Let's take some with mine, too. With mine!

2
00:00:07,735 --> 00:00:10,030
What is it? Let's take it together.

3
00:00:15,985 --> 00:00:17,025
It came out great.

4
00:00:17,025 --> 00:00:19,380
I'll have to change the profile picture. It's been a while.

5
00:00:20,245 --> 00:00:21,841
That's right.

6
00:00:21,841 --> 00:00:22,793
What?

7
00:00:22,793 --> 00:00:24,773
Lee Seungmin and I are supposed to take pictures on the weekend

8
00:00:24,773 --> 00:00:26,078
and change our profile pictures.

9
00:00:26,078 --> 00:00:27,029
Did he say that?

10
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:28,747
That he wants to take pictures as a couple?

11
00:00:28,747 --> 00:00:30,363
Isn't that him trying to use you

12
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:32,574
and just brag to his friends?

13
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:35,353
No. I suggested it.

14
00:00:35,353 --> 00:00:36,525
I'll have to post things like that

15
00:00:36,525 --> 00:00:38,912
for Koo Hyungtak to believe it.

16
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,937
   

17
00:00:44,937 --> 00:00:47,595
   

18
00:00:47,595 --> 00:00:49,093
He says he's coming now. Lee Seungmin, that is.

19
00:00:49,093 --> 00:00:51,929
Hey. Why did you call him when it's just us hanging out?

20
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:53,365
Please bear with me.

21
00:00:53,365 --> 00:00:55,108
At any rate, a contract is a contract.

22
00:00:55,108 --> 00:00:57,169
It's not like I can just not do it.

23
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,300
Well, yes.

24
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,455
We can all hang out together.

25
00:01:00,455 --> 00:01:02,544
He's going to be dating Jina for 50 days,

26
00:01:02,544 --> 00:01:05,110
which means we'll have to keep meeting him as well.

27
00:01:16,136 --> 00:01:17,480
Who...

28
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,380
is this?

29
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,365
I'm Oh Bawool!

30
00:01:19,365 --> 00:01:20,348
Seungmin's best friend!

31
00:01:20,348 --> 00:01:22,786
I was hanging out with him when I had to hurry over here.

32
00:01:22,786 --> 00:01:24,861
I couldn't just leave him alone...

33
00:01:24,861 --> 00:01:25,833
I'm usually

34
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:27,506
kind of a burden.

35
00:01:27,506 --> 00:01:29,577
A burden of such good looks.

36
00:01:31,939 --> 00:01:34,399
Anyway. Glad to meet you, ladies!

37
00:01:35,555 --> 00:01:38,415
Oh, right. Right!

38
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,840
For the ladies,

39
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,940
clean hands are a must.

40
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:53,080


41
00:01:54,285 --> 00:01:56,060
Hey, that's syrup.

42
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,257
What is that? You're hilarious.

43
00:01:58,257 --> 00:01:58,912
What?

44
00:01:58,912 --> 00:02:00,647
Why is this so sticky?

45
00:02:00,647 --> 00:02:01,840
It smells super sweet.

46
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,910
Your personality is really over the top.

47
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:06,080
Oh! Is that why your name is Oh Bawool? 
   (TN: Korean pronunciation of "over" is "oh-ba.")  

48
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,221
Could it be?

49
00:02:07,221 --> 00:02:09,740
Is that really why?

50
00:02:11,915 --> 00:02:13,064
I'll get going.

51
00:02:13,064 --> 00:02:16,056
Why? Where are you going?

52
00:02:16,056 --> 00:02:17,590
It's just that...

53
00:02:21,485 --> 00:02:23,520
rather than wasting time here,

54
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,860
I'll go and practice for the month-end evaluation.

55
00:02:31,035 --> 00:02:33,085
Hanna.

56
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,985
What?

57
00:02:53,985 --> 00:02:56,380
Because it looked like the sun's in your eyes.

58
00:03:00,289 --> 00:03:01,980
Let's get out of here, too.

59
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:02,885
Then,

60
00:03:02,885 --> 00:03:04,325
we'll take you to a delicious place.

61
00:03:04,325 --> 00:03:06,937
Hey! You're not talking about that place, are you?

62
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:07,812
I am!

63
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:11,543
But we said we'd keep that our little secret spot.

64
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,225
The delicious place is...

65
00:03:16,225 --> 00:03:17,942
This?

66
00:03:19,015 --> 00:03:20,320
Just try the food before you judge.

67
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,110
Right. Just try!

68
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,948
Just try the food first!

69
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,378
How is it?

70
00:03:30,378 --> 00:03:32,345
It's weird.

71
00:03:40,215 --> 00:03:41,315
Mmm.

72
00:03:41,315 --> 00:03:42,605
Just like what my grandma used to make.

73
00:03:42,605 --> 00:03:44,112
That sweet and spicy flavor.

74
00:03:44,112 --> 00:03:45,867
What is this? It's so yummy.

75
00:03:45,867 --> 00:03:46,697
Right?

76
00:03:46,697 --> 00:03:50,565
Sweet and savory is out now. Sweet and spicy is totally trending nowadays.

77
00:03:51,236 --> 00:03:53,200
Well, it's not bad.

78
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,520
I'm glad.

79
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,590
Hey, Lee Seungmin.

80
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,612
Hurry and log on.

81
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:58,388
Okay. One sec.

82
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,686
Ah...

83
00:04:00,686 --> 00:04:02,880
Perhaps...

84
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,580
Do you play LOL? 
   (TN: League of Legends.)  

85
00:04:05,395 --> 00:04:06,380
Let's go for an  invade !

86
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,190
Right away. Invade right away.

87
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,227
You want to invade?

88
00:04:08,227 --> 00:04:09,342
Won't it be better not to?

89
00:04:09,342 --> 00:04:09,982
Their combination is really strong.

90
00:04:09,982 --> 00:04:11,157
If you come late, there's no assistance for you.

91
00:04:11,157 --> 00:04:12,067
If you see them, pull.

92
00:04:12,067 --> 00:04:13,011
I told you to pull if you see them.

93
00:04:13,011 --> 00:04:14,669
- Ah!
- Hey!

94
00:04:14,669 --> 00:04:15,623
No, I mean,

95
00:04:15,623 --> 00:04:17,203
why can't you pull when it's right in front of you?

96
00:04:17,203 --> 00:04:18,943
It was right in front of you.

97
00:04:18,943 --> 00:04:20,983
It was a diamond-level flash expectation grab...

98
00:04:20,983 --> 00:04:22,091
Hey, push, push, push.

99
00:04:22,091 --> 00:04:22,666
Hey, push!

100
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:23,422
Hey, push, push, push.

101
00:04:23,422 --> 00:04:24,737
Push, push, push, push.

102
00:04:24,737 --> 00:04:26,516
End it!

103
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,360
End it!

104
00:04:31,796 --> 00:04:33,705
Ah! Nice.

105
00:04:33,705 --> 00:04:34,815
Wow.

106
00:04:34,815 --> 00:04:36,029
Hey.

107
00:04:36,029 --> 00:04:37,461
How are you so good at this?

108
00:04:37,461 --> 00:04:38,977
I think your future is not becoming an idol.

109
00:04:38,977 --> 00:04:40,177
You've got to become a professional gamer!

110
00:04:40,177 --> 00:04:41,357
Did you take a nap?

111
00:04:41,357 --> 00:04:43,090
Did you doze off?

112
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:45,053
Don't you go around saying you play LOL.

113
00:04:45,053 --> 00:04:47,263
You're being so harsh.

114
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:49,945
Oh.

115
00:04:49,945 --> 00:04:50,975
Where's the bathroom here?

116
00:04:50,975 --> 00:04:52,926
Oh, I'll go with you.

117
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:54,717
It's a bit dangerous.

118
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,860
Move aside.

119
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,230
Huh?

120
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,891
Why didn't you get back in?

121
00:05:29,891 --> 00:05:31,511
In case it's scary for you.

122
00:05:31,511 --> 00:05:33,113
Let's go.

123
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,425
Sir!

124
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:43,735
We'll pay with my pass.

125
00:05:43,735 --> 00:05:45,040
No, no! I'll take the bill. I will.

126
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,224
I'll pay for it.

127
00:05:47,224 --> 00:05:48,885
Smile.

128
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:52,990
Done.

129
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,210
Take it again.

130
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:55,502
My facial expression was a bit...

131
00:05:55,502 --> 00:05:57,845
It's alright.

132
00:05:57,845 --> 00:05:58,910
Sent.

133
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:00,740
Put it up as your profile picture as well.

134
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,135
Okay.

135
00:06:04,321 --> 00:06:07,697
   

136
00:06:07,697 --> 00:06:09,517
Yes, Mr. Driver! I'll be out in a second.

137
00:06:09,517 --> 00:06:10,661
Yes!

138
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:12,363
Thank you. Goodbye.

139
00:06:12,363 --> 00:06:13,652
Bye. I'm off.

140
00:06:13,652 --> 00:06:15,892
- Bye.
- Where are you going?

141
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,415
Let's go! I'll take you home.

142
00:06:18,415 --> 00:06:21,060
Which way is your place?

143
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,440
It's that way, near school.

144
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,295
Let's go!

145
00:06:24,295 --> 00:06:25,590
I'll walk you home tonight.

146
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:26,695
That's not right.

147
00:06:26,695 --> 00:06:27,941
I should be the one to take you home.

148
00:06:27,941 --> 00:06:28,867
It's alright.

149
00:06:28,867 --> 00:06:29,796
Hurry up.

150
00:06:29,796 --> 00:06:31,904
Before I change my mind.

151
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,780
Hey, where are you going?

152
00:06:38,775 --> 00:06:41,130
Are you really going?

153
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:42,352
Bye.

154
00:06:42,352 --> 00:06:44,362
I'll get home safe.

155
00:06:45,252 --> 00:06:46,427
Sir.

156
00:06:46,427 --> 00:06:48,567
Add one more hour, please.

157
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,860
   

158
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,411
   

159
00:07:16,955 --> 00:07:22,275
   

160
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,930
Are we here?

161
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:30,930
Yes. It's right around the corner.

162
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,570
I should've walked you home.

163
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:33,410
It's alright.

164
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:35,382
You did it last time.

165
00:07:35,382 --> 00:07:37,492
I'm very precise with giving back what I owe.

166
00:07:37,492 --> 00:07:38,927
Then, I'll walk you home this time. Let's go!

167
00:07:38,927 --> 00:07:40,295
Hey!

168
00:07:40,295 --> 00:07:42,883
I've been walking around without you for the past 18 years.

169
00:07:42,883 --> 00:07:45,359
Do you think something will happen if you don't walk me?

170
00:07:45,359 --> 00:07:46,964
Is that right?

171
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:49,970
Then, hold up.

172
00:07:52,565 --> 00:07:53,925
What are you doing?

173
00:07:53,925 --> 00:07:55,990
Hold up.

174
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,149
Mmm...

175
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,345
I asked what you were doing.

176
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,820
Ah!

177
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,584
Hey.

178
00:08:26,855 --> 00:08:27,820
What?

179
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,797
You want me to go wearing this?

180
00:08:29,797 --> 00:08:30,835
Yes.

181
00:08:30,835 --> 00:08:33,352
Since it's cold.

182
00:08:33,352 --> 00:08:35,939
Then, I'll get going.

183
00:08:47,095 --> 00:08:49,246
What's this?

184
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,820
Ah! Never mind.

185
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,593
He'll come to find it if he needs it.

186
00:09:35,593 --> 00:09:37,062
Jina.

187
00:09:38,136 --> 00:09:38,796
What is that?

188
00:09:38,796 --> 00:09:39,571
Did you buy it?

189
00:09:39,571 --> 00:09:41,368
It's not really your style.

190
00:09:41,368 --> 00:09:45,502
Huh? It's what Seungmin was wearing yesterday.

191
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,640
Why are his clothes here?

192
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,180
He insisted on giving it to me to wear it on my way home.

193
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:53,380
I mean, was he worried that I'd catch a cold or something?

194
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:56,120
He looks weaker than anyone.

195
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,440
Oh, well. I don't have any choice then.

196
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,264
I'll have to bring this back to him myself.

197
00:10:00,264 --> 00:10:02,083
Such a bother.

198
00:10:08,345 --> 00:10:09,720
What's with this loser here?

199
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,575
It's that loser that messed up Hyungtak, isn't he?

200
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,400
Hello.

201
00:10:20,093 --> 00:10:21,690
Are we

202
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:24,637
on speaking terms?

203
00:10:24,637 --> 00:10:26,560
Why would I be glad to see you?

204
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,727
Use your common sense.

205
00:10:28,727 --> 00:10:30,548
Am I wrong?

206
00:10:30,548 --> 00:10:33,273
It's not like I said hello because I'm glad to see you either.

207
00:10:34,085 --> 00:10:35,719
Such a funny guy.

208
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:36,502
Hey...

209
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:39,120
Oh Jina did such a good job picking you.

210
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,824
Hey!

211
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,325
What are you doing here?

212
00:10:46,657 --> 00:10:48,415
Just saying hello...

213
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:50,680
to him.

214
00:10:50,715 --> 00:10:52,345
Hey!

215
00:10:52,345 --> 00:10:54,529
Did you say something to him?

216
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,082
Saying hello.

217
00:10:56,082 --> 00:10:57,499
As he said.

218
00:10:57,499 --> 00:10:58,943
I'm warning you.

219
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,825
If you mess with him in any way...

220
00:11:00,825 --> 00:11:03,045
If I do mess with him,

221
00:11:03,045 --> 00:11:04,229
what are you going to do?

222
00:11:04,229 --> 00:11:06,677
You'll die by my hands then.

223
00:11:10,395 --> 00:11:12,155
Then, bring someone who looks the part

224
00:11:12,155 --> 00:11:14,758
rather than this loser.

225
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:17,637
You'll have to come up to certain standards for me to consider believing this act.

226
00:11:17,637 --> 00:11:20,752
If you really can't believe it this much, I'll help you believe it.

227
00:11:20,752 --> 00:11:22,400
Watch closely.

228
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:29,620


229
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:41,180
♫  Ya, you know we’re so different  ♫

230
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:44,270
♫  I’m just the way I am  ♫

231
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,190
    
 I really won't go easy on you now.  

232
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:51,095
  We can't miss this opportunity where the entire school will be watching.  

233
00:11:51,095 --> 00:11:52,060
  Let's go!  

234
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,515
  Are you saying that Seungmin has had feelings for me from way before?  

235
00:11:54,515 --> 00:11:55,453
  Drink it right away.  

236
00:11:55,453 --> 00:11:56,465
  It'll be huge trouble if you get too dehydrated.  

237
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:58,893
  I'm sorry. I'm regretting my wrongdoings.  

238
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:01,880
♫  On another level  ♫

239
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:07,170
♫  So I have fun 
 So I can just be me  ♫

240
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:09,170
