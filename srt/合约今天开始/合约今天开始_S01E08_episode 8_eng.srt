1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,175
Just date me.

2
00:00:03,175 --> 00:00:04,666
Huh?

3
00:00:05,757 --> 00:00:08,264
I'll adore you.

4
00:00:08,264 --> 00:00:09,730
Crazy b*stard.

5
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:11,546
Oh Jina!

6
00:00:17,281 --> 00:00:19,059
Argh...

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,120
Who are you to get involved in this, you b*stard?

8
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:30,100


9
00:00:31,217 --> 00:00:32,942
Are you okay?

10
00:00:36,205 --> 00:00:37,240
Did you call the police?

11
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,790
Yes.

12
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:45,615
First, let's get that jerk.

13
00:00:49,407 --> 00:00:51,047
Oh Jina.

14
00:00:58,735 --> 00:01:00,375
Park Joonwoo.

15
00:01:01,108 --> 00:01:03,616
Hey, by any chance have you seen a weird guy passing by?

16
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,746
Was that you, you rat b*stard?

17
00:01:44,505 --> 00:01:46,795
It was so hectic earlier. I didn't hear it.

18
00:01:46,795 --> 00:01:49,906
What will happen to him now?

19
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,540
He'll be locked up in jail.

20
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,345
And the school will hold a disciplinary review.

21
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,525
Don't worry too much.

22
00:02:00,525 --> 00:02:02,923
What a dirty b*stard.

23
00:02:03,725 --> 00:02:05,905
Are you close to him?

24
00:02:06,895 --> 00:02:08,465
Nope.

25
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,105
You didn't get hurt, right?

26
00:02:14,105 --> 00:02:17,312
No, thankfully.

27
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,010
Hey, Lee Seungmin.

28
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,545
If you're going to be the one who stays by Jina,

29
00:02:26,545 --> 00:02:28,600
keep your head on straight.

30
00:02:38,295 --> 00:02:40,010
Get home safely.

31
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,705
Okay, thank you for today.

32
00:02:59,285 --> 00:03:00,600
It's okay.

33
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,805
You know it's not your fault.

34
00:03:03,885 --> 00:03:05,180
I am so sorry.

35
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,527
It was so dangerous, and I let you go by yourself.

36
00:03:07,537 --> 00:03:10,445
It was good that you showed up at the right moment.

37
00:03:10,445 --> 00:03:13,071
If it wasn't for you, I would've been in trouble.

38
00:03:13,071 --> 00:03:14,717
You saved me.

39
00:03:14,717 --> 00:03:16,901
Why would you say that?

40
00:03:16,901 --> 00:03:18,168
It makes me feel more sorry.

41
00:03:18,168 --> 00:03:21,924
It's true! You saved me.

42
00:03:21,924 --> 00:03:24,145
I will always take you home from now on.

43
00:03:24,145 --> 00:03:26,652
Gosh! This is going to be a huge hassle for me.

44
00:03:26,652 --> 00:03:28,966
Well, too bad even if it's a hassle for you.

45
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:32,331
Okay, got it. Go now.

46
00:03:32,331 --> 00:03:34,496
No, I have to take you home.

47
00:03:34,496 --> 00:03:36,544
This is heading toward my house.

48
00:03:36,544 --> 00:03:37,572
Hurry up.

49
00:03:37,572 --> 00:03:38,870
It's not this way.

50
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,420
It is.

51
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,926
It's that way...

52
00:03:46,231 --> 00:03:48,520
Will you be able to sleep alone?

53
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,521
What can I do? My parents are in Jeju Island.

54
00:03:51,521 --> 00:03:54,887
Get some rest. I bet you were scared today.

55
00:03:54,887 --> 00:03:57,002
Okay.

56
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:03,219
Or do you want to come inside with me?

57
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,383
Sorry? Well...

58
00:04:10,325 --> 00:04:11,725
Do you want me to just leave?

59
00:04:11,725 --> 00:04:14,024
No, no.

60
00:04:21,201 --> 00:04:22,771
Wow...

61
00:04:25,805 --> 00:04:27,533
 Calm down, Lee Seungmin. 

62
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:31,272
 You are here to protect Jina. How can you be the scared one? 

63
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:33,089
Do you want comfortable clothes?

64
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:35,905
Well...

65
00:04:35,905 --> 00:04:36,800
If you don't want them, forget it.

66
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,948
No, no. Please give them to me.

67
00:04:42,745 --> 00:04:44,525
We haven't reached our 22-day anniversary, right?

68
00:04:44,525 --> 00:04:47,647
I kept my promise. Treating you to delicious food.

69
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,620
You're just staring at me. Why aren't you eating?

70
00:04:56,565 --> 00:04:59,841
I know it's hard not look at me.

71
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:02,236
Eat up.

72
00:05:02,236 --> 00:05:06,100
I agree that it's hard not to look at you, but

73
00:05:06,118 --> 00:05:08,777
I think I have to take something off first.

74
00:05:24,155 --> 00:05:25,330
Stop it.

75
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,795
I left it there on purpose so I can eat it tomorrow.

76
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:29,619
Hurry up and eat.

77
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,450
Since when did you become friends with Hanna?

78
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:43,250
Since I became a trainee.

79
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,240
So about four years?

80
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,158
I was very lonely when I had to move to Seoul.

81
00:05:48,158 --> 00:05:51,318
But I met Hanna, and I was able to adapt here.

82
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:54,155
She's a friend I'm really grateful for.

83
00:05:54,155 --> 00:05:55,580
I see.

84
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,285
Do you want to go to sleep?

85
00:06:10,585 --> 00:06:12,275
No... I mean...

86
00:06:12,275 --> 00:06:14,885
It's time to go to sleep, and I bet you're tired...

87
00:06:14,885 --> 00:06:16,572
Let's go to sleep.

88
00:06:18,151 --> 00:06:19,121
No, I mean...

89
00:06:19,121 --> 00:06:20,585
How can I sleep with you?

90
00:06:20,585 --> 00:06:21,925
I was asking you, Jina.

91
00:06:21,925 --> 00:06:22,999
"Jina, do you want to go to sleep?" Like this.

92
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:24,112
Right?

93
00:06:24,112 --> 00:06:25,325
Yes...

94
00:06:25,325 --> 00:06:26,632
I will stay up tonight.

95
00:06:26,632 --> 00:06:29,041
I am here to protect you.

96
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:31,068
I mean, not protecting you in that way...

97
00:06:31,068 --> 00:06:31,970
Since you were so scared todayâ€”

98
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:33,750
Stop talking.

99
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,486
Okay...

100
00:06:57,465 --> 00:06:59,765
 It's Lee Seungmin's scent. 

101
00:06:59,765 --> 00:07:02,943
 Oh, it was his shampoo scent. 

102
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,050
 What's this? 

103
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,437
 Am I looking at Lee Seungmin with loving eyes right now? 

104
00:07:39,952 --> 00:07:42,012
Jina, what happened to you?

105
00:07:42,012 --> 00:07:43,190
Are you okay?

106
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,525
Of course. I am fine.

107
00:07:44,525 --> 00:07:47,003
They had the disciplinary review earlier this morning.

108
00:07:47,003 --> 00:07:49,149
He will be transferred to a different school.

109
00:07:49,149 --> 00:07:50,174
What?

110
00:07:50,174 --> 00:07:52,966
He should be placed in a juvenile correctional facility!

111
00:07:52,966 --> 00:07:56,453
I think he will be on probation for now.

112
00:07:56,453 --> 00:07:58,352
But it's fortunate...

113
00:07:58,352 --> 00:07:59,945
that nothing bad happened to you.

114
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,850
Wait a moment.

115
00:08:11,425 --> 00:08:13,165
Yesterday...

116
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,330
did you go home well?

117
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:21,870
I should be the one asking that of you.

118
00:08:23,074 --> 00:08:24,824
What about you?

119
00:08:24,824 --> 00:08:27,317
Did he take you home?

120
00:08:27,317 --> 00:08:28,714
Yes.

121
00:08:32,995 --> 00:08:34,540
For everything...

122
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:36,150
thanks.

123
00:08:39,415 --> 00:08:42,010
Wow, did you

124
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:46,320
ever say thank you to me this often?

125
00:08:47,075 --> 00:08:48,995
No.

126
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:51,515
I feel weird saying it.

127
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:00,035
You should give me a gift if you are thankful.

128
00:09:00,035 --> 00:09:02,110
What gift?

129
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:04,704
Don't tell me you want to be my boyfriend.

130
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,920
Not boyfriend.

131
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,480
I want to be your guy friend.

132
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,090
Let me be your guy friend.

133
00:09:16,685 --> 00:09:17,930
Forget about everything and

134
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:19,201
just think of good things only.

135
00:09:19,201 --> 00:09:20,847
And have some healing time, too.

136
00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:22,339
Okay.

137
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,555
Wait.

138
00:09:23,555 --> 00:09:25,589
How about we go to my vacation house in Yangpyeong?

139
00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:26,896
To refresh!

140
00:09:26,896 --> 00:09:28,591
Refresh...

141
00:09:28,591 --> 00:09:30,186
It's my favorite thing to do.

142
00:09:30,186 --> 00:09:31,426
Let's go.

143
00:09:31,426 --> 00:09:32,842
Let's go, please?

144
00:09:32,842 --> 00:09:34,157
Why are you so excited?

145
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:35,372
Gosh...

146
00:09:35,372 --> 00:09:37,462
Seungmin, you will come, too, right?

147
00:09:37,492 --> 00:09:39,088
Me?

148
00:09:39,715 --> 00:09:41,240
I'd love to.

149
00:09:42,313 --> 00:09:43,288
Me, too!

150
00:09:43,288 --> 00:09:44,900
Okay!

151
00:09:44,908 --> 00:09:46,458
Lee Seungmin.

152
00:09:50,395 --> 00:09:51,860
I will come, too.

153
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:54,386
What the heck? You scared me.

154
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:56,116
I will come, too.

155
00:09:56,892 --> 00:09:58,604
Is that okay?

156
00:09:58,604 --> 00:10:00,643
I am your guy friend, after all.

157
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,635
    
 This is your house?  

158
00:10:16,635 --> 00:10:17,444
  It's under my name.  

159
00:10:17,444 --> 00:10:18,591
  Take some rest.  

160
00:10:18,591 --> 00:10:19,767
  Are you worried about me?  

161
00:10:19,767 --> 00:10:21,077
  Should I cut it this big?  

162
00:10:21,077 --> 00:10:22,415
  Yes, it's perfect.  

163
00:10:22,415 --> 00:10:24,965
  Who are you most interested in?  

164
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:29,026
  Are your feelings about me genuine now?  

165
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,570
   

166
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,622
   

167
00:10:36,622 --> 00:10:38,367
   

168
00:10:48,275 --> 00:10:49,220
  Yes, Mom.  

169
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,878
 What happened to you? 

170
00:10:50,886 --> 00:10:54,119
 Do you know how worried we were after getting a call from the police? 

171
00:10:54,119 --> 00:10:57,636
 We couldn't find a flight because it's too late. 

172
00:10:57,636 --> 00:11:00,187
 What are you doing? Are you okay? 

173
00:11:00,187 --> 00:11:02,997
 I will take the first flight in the morning. 

174
00:11:02,997 --> 00:11:04,927
 I'm fine now.  

175
00:11:04,927 --> 00:11:07,304
 I am with someone. 

176
00:11:07,304 --> 00:11:08,992
 At this time? 

177
00:11:08,992 --> 00:11:10,565
 Who? 

178
00:11:10,565 --> 00:11:12,446
 There is someone. 

179
00:11:13,563 --> 00:11:15,930
 Someone that I rely on a lot lately.
