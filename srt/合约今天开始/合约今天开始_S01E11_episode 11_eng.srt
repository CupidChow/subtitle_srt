1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,995
Why didn't you pick up my call quickly?

2
00:00:01,995 --> 00:00:05,045
Do you think I have a lot of time on my hands?

3
00:00:05,045 --> 00:00:07,270
Is that why it's so hard to see you?

4
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:09,756
Here I am.

5
00:00:09,756 --> 00:00:12,364
Look at me all you want now.

6
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:20,450


7
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:22,698
You almost scared me.

8
00:00:22,698 --> 00:00:25,160
What's so funny?

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,320
You know.

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,773
Jina makes you smile by just looking at her.

11
00:00:28,773 --> 00:00:30,038
How are you?

12
00:00:30,038 --> 00:00:32,108
You must be really busy.

13
00:00:32,108 --> 00:00:34,035
Yes, as always.

14
00:00:34,035 --> 00:00:34,723
Oh!

15
00:00:34,723 --> 00:00:36,878
Why didn't you bring that boyfriend of yours?

16
00:00:36,878 --> 00:00:37,953
Yes.

17
00:00:37,953 --> 00:00:38,928
Call him.

18
00:00:38,928 --> 00:00:40,334
Your famous boyfriend.

19
00:00:40,334 --> 00:00:41,486
Let's see him.

20
00:00:41,486 --> 00:00:42,824
Lee Seungmin?

21
00:00:42,824 --> 00:00:44,336
What do you mean, famous?

22
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:45,246
I'm the famous one.

23
00:00:45,246 --> 00:00:45,996
Hey.

24
00:00:45,996 --> 00:00:48,480
He's become pretty famous after dating you.

25
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,235
That happened to Hyunho's couple, too.

26
00:00:50,235 --> 00:00:52,756
Yeondoo is more famous these days than Hyunho.

27
00:00:52,756 --> 00:00:54,304
Really?

28
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,190
I should tell him to thank me.

29
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,479
You'll have to wait and see if that's something he should thank you for

30
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:01,677
or resent you for.

31
00:01:01,677 --> 00:01:02,580
So...

32
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,260
how did you end up dating?

33
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,167
You two.

34
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,250
We have

35
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,099
a dating contract.

36
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:15,138
A dating contract?

37
00:01:15,138 --> 00:01:16,528
Are you out of your mind?

38
00:01:16,528 --> 00:01:18,273
Do you want to hear something more surprising?

39
00:01:18,273 --> 00:01:21,254
I can't believe this myself either, but...

40
00:01:21,254 --> 00:01:23,080
I...

41
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,730
kind of like him.

42
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,690
What about him?

43
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:30,996
Does he like you, too?

44
00:01:30,996 --> 00:01:33,001
Why are you asking me that?

45
00:01:33,001 --> 00:01:35,476
Of course he does.

46
00:01:35,476 --> 00:01:36,892
Then what's the problem?

47
00:01:36,892 --> 00:01:38,415
There's no problem.

48
00:01:38,415 --> 00:01:40,209
I'm going to tell him how I feel.

49
00:01:40,209 --> 00:01:42,242
After the contract is terminated.

50
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,751
You are so my little sister.

51
00:01:45,751 --> 00:01:49,391
There's nothing like going for it when you like a guy.

52
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,465
Oh, yeah.

53
00:01:53,465 --> 00:01:56,531
How about Hanna?

54
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,840
Hey, you.

55
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,114
I'll give you back the

56
00:02:06,114 --> 00:02:08,584
10 million won ($10,000),

57
00:02:08,584 --> 00:02:11,351
so go get Jina back.

58
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,040
You're going to give it back to me?

59
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,825
Why?

60
00:02:16,825 --> 00:02:18,308
What do you mean, why?

61
00:02:18,308 --> 00:02:21,814
Jina left our company because of that.

62
00:02:21,814 --> 00:02:23,150
To be honest,

63
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,520
Oh Jina is the important one.

64
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,640
The CEO said that he doesn't want to debut the group without Jina.

65
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,700
I could go get her myself,

66
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,379
but still...

67
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:40,185
Jina left the company because she was defending you.

68
00:02:40,185 --> 00:02:43,480
So wouldn't it look a lot better

69
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,297
if you persuaded her to return yourself?

70
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,790
I erased her number.

71
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,615
What are you saying?

72
00:02:52,615 --> 00:02:55,165
You two were close.

73
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,950
Not anymore.

74
00:03:01,671 --> 00:03:06,176
 

75
00:03:08,615 --> 00:03:13,275
   

76
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,750
Oh, yeah.

77
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,745
I uploaded the video you

78
00:03:17,745 --> 00:03:18,967
took of me on YouTube.

79
00:03:18,967 --> 00:03:20,757
Really?

80
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:24,120
Whoa.

81
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,283
It already has 100,000 views?

82
00:03:25,283 --> 00:03:26,881
This is nuts.

83
00:03:26,881 --> 00:03:28,394
This is all thanks...

84
00:03:28,394 --> 00:03:31,567
to myself.

85
00:03:31,567 --> 00:03:33,016
Well,

86
00:03:33,016 --> 00:03:35,655
you helped me, too.

87
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,815
Oh, I should focus.

88
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,625
Let go of this.

89
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,925
Math is all about time.

90
00:04:07,925 --> 00:04:10,025
Yes!

91
00:04:23,365 --> 00:04:24,420
This won't do.

92
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,800
You should really focus.

93
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,397
What?

94
00:04:27,397 --> 00:04:29,989
I am focusing.

95
00:04:29,989 --> 00:04:33,152
I can't believe that I'm studying so well right now.

96
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:44,970
   

97
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,020
What's this?

98
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,415
Minji is beautiful.

99
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,800
"Beautiful"?

100
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:01,905
You dummy, this isn't the right spelling.

101
00:05:01,905 --> 00:05:04,400
For beautiful...

102
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,290
You have to take out the E and U.

103
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:09,395
Because you're

104
00:05:09,395 --> 00:05:12,825
beautiful for no reason. (T/N: "Ee-yoo" means "reason" in Korean.)

105
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,600
Come on!

106
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,061
I can't believe you, Oh Bawool.

107
00:05:17,061 --> 00:05:19,601
What's wrong with you?

108
00:05:21,397 --> 00:05:23,747
Be quiet.

109
00:05:25,669 --> 00:05:27,790
All right.

110
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:28,720
Oh, yeah!

111
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,610
I heard that Koo Hyungtak hit three home runs.

112
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,077
- Really? 
- Yes.

113
00:05:32,077 --> 00:05:33,503
Wow.

114
00:05:33,503 --> 00:05:36,114
I should look up his game.

115
00:05:37,025 --> 00:05:38,505
Oh!

116
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,470
He gave an interview.

117
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,685
Really? Let me see.

118
00:05:42,685 --> 00:05:44,800
 The ball seemed really big to me today. 
   

119
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,600
   

120
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,205
 I don't think we'll have any trouble 
   

121
00:05:48,205 --> 00:05:50,635
 winning this season as long as I feel good. 

122
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,796
 No matter how well 
   

123
00:05:53,796 --> 00:05:57,532
 I play, there's this girl who is always displeased with me. 

124
00:05:57,532 --> 00:06:00,640
 I want her to cheer for me. 

125
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,960
 You're going to cheer me on, right, Jina? 

126
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,060
 Wow. 

127
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:07,800
What is this?

128
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,080
Does he still like Jina?

129
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,545
Whoa.

130
00:06:12,545 --> 00:06:14,810
Our poor Seungmin.

131
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,910
What will he do?

132
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,260
I saw the interview.

133
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:31,020
What was that at the end?

134
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,980
You heard of this saying, right?

135
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,940
"The real game starts with two outs in the ninth inning."

136
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,480
Don't let your guard down.

137
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,250
The game isn't over yet.

138
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,765
What? 
    

139
00:07:00,765 --> 00:07:02,990
Oh, no, this can't die.

140
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,499
Do you have a spare battery?

141
00:07:04,499 --> 00:07:06,986
No, I don't.

142
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,015
I don't either.

143
00:07:10,015 --> 00:07:11,510
Oh, man.

144
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,535
What will I do?

145
00:07:15,795 --> 00:07:17,980
What about in here?

146
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,440
What?

147
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,585
What's this?

148
00:07:27,435 --> 00:07:29,691
Wow!

149
00:07:29,691 --> 00:07:31,093
I haven't seen something like this in a long time.

150
00:07:31,093 --> 00:07:32,853
What is it?

151
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:35,241
Wow, they wrote this?

152
00:07:35,241 --> 00:07:37,696
That's so cheesy!

153
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,730
Are you okay?

154
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:41,860
"Party A, Oh Jina."

155
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,340
- "Party B, Lee Seungmin." 
 - "Lee Seungmin."

156
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,700
Wow!

157
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,365
It's so cheesy.

158
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:48,050
Who's the A in our relationship?

159
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,473
You can be A.

160
00:07:49,473 --> 00:07:52,601
What are you talking about? It should be you.

161
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,955
 Have you seen this? 
    Doah - It's Okay Because It's You. Cover by Oh Jina]  

162
00:07:56,955 --> 00:08:02,570
 The CEO is in a fuss over this. Go and persuade Jina. 

163
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:08,060
    Wow, her voice is amazing. 
   Doah - It's Okay Because It's You. Cover by Oh Jina] 

164
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:11,440
 She'd win against all the idols who've already debuted. 
   

165
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,390
 I wish she'd release this on a streaming site. 
   

166
00:08:16,015 --> 00:08:19,275
 This is so unfair. 

167
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,300
Where is Jina?

168
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,160
That d*mned Oh Jina, Oh Jina.

169
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,940
Why are you asking me where she is?

170
00:08:39,115 --> 00:08:40,779
 What do you have that I don't? 

171
00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:43,768
 Why does everyone only care about her? 

172
00:08:43,768 --> 00:08:46,150
 If you have the least bit of a conscience, 

173
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,868
 let me have at least one thing. 

174
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,725
Your contract is over soon, right?

175
00:08:58,725 --> 00:08:59,705
Oh.

176
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,274
Is it already time for that?

177
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:02,699
Why did you ask?

178
00:09:02,699 --> 00:09:05,100
If you're done with her,

179
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,224
start with me.

180
00:09:06,224 --> 00:09:07,726
Date me.

181
00:09:07,726 --> 00:09:08,806
Oh...

182
00:09:08,806 --> 00:09:10,096
Don't joke.

183
00:09:10,096 --> 00:09:12,311
No, I'm serious.

184
00:09:12,311 --> 00:09:15,259
I've liked you for a long time now.

185
00:09:17,437 --> 00:09:19,040
If you don't like me yet,

186
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,160
then let's start with a contract, too.

187
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,985
Then you might fall in love with me.

188
00:09:26,138 --> 00:09:28,600
I'd be nicer to you

189
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,220
than Oh Jina.

190
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,155
I'm sorry.

191
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,990
I really like Jina.

192
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:45,210
And I don't think this will change after the contract is over.

193
00:09:47,085 --> 00:09:50,165
Why isn't it me?

194
00:09:51,285 --> 00:09:52,135
That's...

195
00:09:52,135 --> 00:09:54,316
I've tried and tried

196
00:09:54,316 --> 00:09:56,826
to be as good as her.

197
00:09:56,826 --> 00:09:58,776
Why do you like her more?

198
00:09:58,776 --> 00:10:01,561
Why does everyone like her more?

199
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,420
Hey!

200
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,315
What are you doing here?

201
00:10:10,315 --> 00:10:11,790
You two?

202
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:15,320
Can't you see that we're talking?

203
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,360
 Who are you most interested in? 

204
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,310
Then go ahead.

205
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:22,370
Right now.

206
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:24,125
Can you go and wait in the classroom?

207
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,500
I'll catch up with you.

208
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,691
What do you two have to talk about without me?

209
00:10:32,538 --> 00:10:33,673
Wow.

210
00:10:33,673 --> 00:10:35,606
Let's go.

211
00:10:38,465 --> 00:10:40,385
He's my boyfriend.

212
00:10:40,385 --> 00:10:42,320
Don't mess with him.

213
00:10:52,471 --> 00:10:55,370
   

214
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,003
Does that make any sense at all?

215
00:10:57,003 --> 00:10:59,339
Wow, really?

216
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,405
What the—

217
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,920
Hey...

218
00:11:21,401 --> 00:11:23,589
Jina!

219
00:11:41,163 --> 00:11:42,047
   

220
00:11:42,047 --> 00:11:43,297
   

221
00:11:43,297 --> 00:11:44,553
   

222
00:11:44,553 --> 00:11:46,803
     

223
00:11:56,874 --> 00:11:57,675
  It's me. 
    

224
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:58,540
 The person who took out the contract 

225
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,924
 from your backpack. 

226
00:11:59,924 --> 00:12:01,306
 Who did this? 

227
00:12:01,306 --> 00:12:03,862
 Mine is at home, so I think someone got a hold of Seungmin's. 

228
00:12:03,862 --> 00:12:06,192
 You said you lost the contract, 

229
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:07,896
 so Jina is really upset with you. 

230
00:12:07,896 --> 00:12:09,488
 What's this? 

231
00:12:09,488 --> 00:12:11,540
 Hyungtak, where are you going? 

232
00:12:12,433 --> 00:12:14,260
 Jina, where are you going? 

233
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,160
♫  You know we’re so different  ♫

234
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,730
♫  I'm just the way I am  ♫

235
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:19,640
♫  Calling you from that place,  ♫

236
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,990
♫  so I can show you a new world  ♫

237
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,800
