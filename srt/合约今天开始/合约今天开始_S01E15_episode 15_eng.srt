1
00:00:01,705 --> 00:00:05,868
The reason dreams are beautiful,

2
00:00:05,868 --> 00:00:11,888
probably more than anything else, is because they're so short.

3
00:00:12,674 --> 00:00:16,372
That's the end of Hwayang High's lunch show.

4
00:00:17,766 --> 00:00:19,701
Lee Seungmin, you're so good!

5
00:00:19,701 --> 00:00:22,408
You did an amazing job.

6
00:00:22,408 --> 00:00:24,750
 The days go by, not any different from the day before.  

7
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,805
You could be an announcer.

8
00:00:26,805 --> 00:00:30,956
 But one thing has changed. 

9
00:00:30,956 --> 00:00:35,742
 Jina is no longer in my life. 

10
00:00:40,568 --> 00:00:43,401
 Everything has changed. 

11
00:00:44,985 --> 00:00:49,612
 But one thing hasn't changed. 

12
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:53,024
   
   

13
00:00:53,024 --> 00:00:54,180
   

14
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:02,409
 That the blanket Seungmin gave me is still warm. 

15
00:01:14,923 --> 00:01:18,964
   

16
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:49,759
I sense that you're kind of down.

17
00:01:50,792 --> 00:01:52,217
What do you mean?

18
00:01:52,217 --> 00:01:54,107
You two.

19
00:01:56,741 --> 00:02:02,945
We... broke up.

20
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:11,066
Are you crazy, Oh Jina? Come on.

21
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:26,037
Did you ever cry like this after you broke up with me?

22
00:02:27,146 --> 00:02:29,643
You're really a funny guy.

23
00:02:29,643 --> 00:02:31,520
You can't help but talk about yourself even at times like this?

24
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,507
- I asked you a question. 
 - Of course I did.

25
00:02:35,507 --> 00:02:39,725
Not after we broke up, though.

26
00:02:39,725 --> 00:02:41,947
While we were going out.

27
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,710
That's a low blow.

28
00:02:48,696 --> 00:02:51,344
Pretend you didn't see me cry just now.

29
00:02:51,344 --> 00:02:53,390
To be honest,

30
00:02:55,150 --> 00:03:01,820
I waited until your contract with Lee Seungmin was over.

31
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:09,537
But seeing you like this

32
00:03:13,433 --> 00:03:16,797
makes me think things won't go my way.

33
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:18,576
Hey...

34
00:03:19,796 --> 00:03:25,127
But you'll still let me be your guy friend, right?

35
00:03:25,127 --> 00:03:29,721
I'm pretty confident that I won't make you cry as a friend.

36
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:33,865
We'll see.

37
00:03:35,226 --> 00:03:37,898
If you can,

38
00:03:37,898 --> 00:03:42,080
try to be so happy that I feel jealous.

39
00:03:43,444 --> 00:03:50,416
Don't give up your love for someone else and be hurt like this.

40
00:04:01,275 --> 00:04:03,362
What are you doing?

41
00:04:12,308 --> 00:04:15,125
Were you looking at pictures of Mom?

42
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:16,842
Yes.

43
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:22,310
She was beautiful, your mom.

44
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,373
Did you break up with your girlfriend?

45
00:04:33,729 --> 00:04:36,300
How did you know?

46
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,840
Of course I can tell.

47
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:43,738
I can tell that you still really like her.

48
00:04:43,738 --> 00:04:45,943
I was sure that she liked me, too.

49
00:04:45,943 --> 00:04:49,343
I could feel it.

50
00:04:51,775 --> 00:04:54,798
But she suddenly told me she wanted to break up.

51
00:04:58,087 --> 00:05:00,470
So...

52
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:04,533
I'm not sure what I should do.

53
00:05:05,685 --> 00:05:10,903
How about you believe what you saw in her heart

54
00:05:10,903 --> 00:05:13,509
and try one more time?

55
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:17,216
She might be waiting for you.

56
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:20,492
But she already told me she wanted to end things.

57
00:05:20,492 --> 00:05:23,648
Isn't it too selfish of me to ask her again?

58
00:05:23,648 --> 00:05:29,328
Sometimes, there is an honesty you can't see with your eyes.

59
00:05:29,328 --> 00:05:32,580
But figuring it out

60
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:36,126
and not letting go might be more considerate towards that person.

61
00:05:49,081 --> 00:05:52,757
Then I'll go check one last time.

62
00:06:07,982 --> 00:06:10,173
What's this?

63
00:06:10,173 --> 00:06:12,356
When did this...

64
00:06:15,257 --> 00:06:18,075
We should get rid of the other ones first.

65
00:06:45,148 --> 00:06:47,089
Yes?

66
00:06:47,089 --> 00:06:48,926
 What are you doing? 

67
00:06:48,926 --> 00:06:50,912
 I'm in your neighborhood. 

68
00:06:50,912 --> 00:06:53,140
 Do you want to come out for a second? 

69
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,588
 I have something to say to you. 

70
00:06:58,278 --> 00:07:00,337
All right.

71
00:07:20,923 --> 00:07:23,143
 How long has that been broken? 

72
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:25,623
 It could be really dangerous. 

73
00:07:52,669 --> 00:07:55,431
I heard that you broke up with Seungmin.

74
00:07:55,431 --> 00:07:57,825
Are you okay?

75
00:07:57,825 --> 00:08:00,364
It's hard, isn't it?

76
00:08:00,364 --> 00:08:02,461
Did you call me so you can comfort me?

77
00:08:02,461 --> 00:08:06,318
Of course. We're friends again.

78
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,165
Hanna, what's your definition of "friends"?

79
00:08:13,031 --> 00:08:17,600
Not getting on each other's nerves?

80
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,819
Really?

81
00:08:18,819 --> 00:08:22,731
Then is it my job to not get on your nerves

82
00:08:22,731 --> 00:08:25,672
and hang out with you from time to time?

83
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,113
I guess?

84
00:08:27,113 --> 00:08:28,809
That's what real friends are.

85
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:32,198
Then I shouldn't become more popular than you do

86
00:08:32,198 --> 00:08:38,162
and should break up with my boyfriend if you happen to fall for him, too, right?

87
00:08:38,162 --> 00:08:40,953
Is that it? Is that what real friends are?

88
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:43,267
You're going a little overboard here.

89
00:08:44,578 --> 00:08:47,231
Well, guess what.

90
00:08:47,231 --> 00:08:50,825
I don't need a friend like that.

91
00:08:50,825 --> 00:08:55,250
I can't believe I broke up with Seungmin just

92
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,193
so I could keep being friends with you.

93
00:08:57,193 --> 00:08:59,330
You're the one who wanted to be friends.

94
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,960
You're right.

95
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,493
Why did I think that I had to give up everything to be friends with you?

96
00:09:04,493 --> 00:09:05,472
What are you saying?

97
00:09:05,472 --> 00:09:08,534
I'm saying that I won't be friends with you anymore.

98
00:09:16,627 --> 00:09:20,280
Since we were friends, let me give you some advice.

99
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,522
I never took what was yours.

100
00:09:22,522 --> 00:09:24,850
You wouldn't have been able to get them even if it weren't for me.

101
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,680
You just needed someone to blame everything on.

102
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,531
What are you saying? If it weren't for you, I would have—

103
00:09:28,531 --> 00:09:31,731
Don't use me as your excuse anymore and get a hold of yourself.

104
00:09:31,731 --> 00:09:34,650
I'm going to find what's mine.

105
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,399
 I was wrong. 

106
00:09:53,399 --> 00:10:00,133
 It wasn't the betraying friend that I should have kept but you. 

107
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:15,132
 I was wrong. 

108
00:10:15,132 --> 00:10:19,160
 I shouldn't have let you go. I should have held on stronger. 

109
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:35,834
Are you... running to me right now?

110
00:10:35,834 --> 00:10:37,807
Yes.

111
00:10:37,807 --> 00:10:40,165
Can I?

112
00:10:40,165 --> 00:10:42,223
Hurry up.

113
00:10:51,241 --> 00:10:54,079
I like you a lot. A lot.

114
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,070
I know.

115
00:10:59,139 --> 00:11:01,890
What about you? Why aren't you saying anything?

116
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:06,338
Do I have to say it? I like you beyond your dreams.

117
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:09,936
I won't ever let you go.

118
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:14,392
You can let go. I'll go and get you back.

119
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,492
But... why are you speaking casually to me?

120
00:11:39,492 --> 00:11:42,579
- Because I feel like it.
 - I'll get you.

121
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:50,360
   

122
00:11:53,225 --> 00:11:55,549
Jina, you were first place.

123
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:57,314
- Wow. Awesome.
 - So cool.

124
00:11:57,314 --> 00:11:58,695
What if you become famous nationwide?

125
00:11:58,695 --> 00:12:00,793
Oh Jina is the best.

126
00:12:00,793 --> 00:12:02,802
- I know.
 - Wow, this is so cool.

127
00:12:02,802 --> 00:12:05,285
Thanks.

128
00:12:05,285 --> 00:12:06,980
Did you hear?

129
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,961
Hanna is going to drop out.

130
00:12:09,961 --> 00:12:12,872
- Drop out? 
 - Yes.

131
00:12:12,872 --> 00:12:16,648
She stopped coming to school for a few days, and apparently, that's what she's going to do.

132
00:12:16,648 --> 00:12:18,501
She was on her way to the teacher's office earlier.

133
00:12:18,501 --> 00:12:21,268
Another star falls from Hwayang High?

134
00:12:21,268 --> 00:12:24,542
Hey! Jina was always the number one star.

135
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:31,467
Hanna.

136
00:12:31,467 --> 00:12:33,591
Are you really leaving?

137
00:12:33,591 --> 00:12:34,941
Yes.

138
00:12:34,941 --> 00:12:38,917
I'm going to look for another agency and make my debut.

139
00:12:38,917 --> 00:12:42,056
Okay, I'll be rooting for you.

140
00:12:43,188 --> 00:12:45,586
I'm going now.

141
00:12:45,586 --> 00:12:48,112
Hanna.

142
00:12:48,112 --> 00:12:49,895
Stay well.

143
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:53,036
You're pretty and cool enough,

144
00:12:53,036 --> 00:12:56,365
so don't blame yourself.

145
00:12:56,365 --> 00:13:00,479
If you get your thoughts together, give me a call, okay?

146
00:13:14,346 --> 00:13:16,648
Did you say goodbye to Hanna?

147
00:13:16,648 --> 00:13:18,245
Yes.

148
00:13:18,245 --> 00:13:22,079
Good. You should look after her.

149
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,293
Dummy.

150
00:13:26,356 --> 00:13:29,305
Jina! Jina!

151
00:13:30,934 --> 00:13:33,767
Seungmin asked you to come up to the roof.

152
00:13:33,767 --> 00:13:35,626
The roof?

153
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,559
Why did you call me here?

154
00:13:55,448 --> 00:13:56,660
What's this?

155
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:59,100
   

156
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,196
Forever is too long.

157
00:14:01,196 --> 00:14:03,222
There's only one condition.

158
00:14:03,222 --> 00:14:07,113
- "How we date is up to us"? 
 - Yes.

159
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:10,068
You're going to sign it, right?

160
00:14:10,068 --> 00:14:14,313
I don't think this is going to work.

161
00:14:14,313 --> 00:14:16,867
Come on. Why not?

162
00:14:20,183 --> 00:14:23,900
There. You stamp here.

163
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:27,100
   

164
00:14:28,792 --> 00:14:32,597
I want to stamp somewhere else.

165
00:14:32,597 --> 00:14:34,333
Where?

166
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,214
Here.

167
00:14:47,552 --> 00:14:52,413
Then I'm going to be your boyfriend from now on, okay?

168
00:14:53,243 --> 00:14:55,721
No.

169
00:14:55,721 --> 00:14:58,159
I'm going to be your girlfriend.

170
00:15:06,215 --> 00:15:10,409
 Hwayang High School students, are you having a good lunchtime? 

171
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:14,443
 It might be the hottest moment in someone's life. 

172
00:15:14,443 --> 00:15:18,599
 And for someone else, it might be like any other day. 

173
00:15:18,599 --> 00:15:23,088
 The weight of time might feel different 

174
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:26,365
 for everyone, but as long as you try your best, 

175
00:15:26,365 --> 00:15:29,570
 I'm sure that will be enough. 

176
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:32,628
- Nice! 
 - Crazy!

177
00:15:32,628 --> 00:15:35,860
 Like us... 

178
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,020
 who started with a contract but ended with real love. 

179
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:46,920


180
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:50,800
Jina, hold on.

181
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,480
I'll go again. I'm sorry.

182
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:01,536
- No way! 
 - No way! 
   - Again. Cut.  

183
00:16:01,536 --> 00:16:05,089
I'm sorry. So sorry.

184
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,919
 - Cut!   
 - I'll go again.

185
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:10,090
- Again. 
 - It won't come off.

186
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:12,893
- The cellphone turned off. 
 - It turned off.

187
00:16:12,893 --> 00:16:14,090
Yes, okay.

188
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:15,540
  Cut!  

189
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,780
Yes. I'm sorry.

190
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,593
Like you— Gosh.

191
00:16:22,593 --> 00:16:24,020
You bugged me from that day on.

192
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,000
  I'm sorry.  

193
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,250
  Okay, cut!  

194
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:33,220
Why is it so hard to get a hold of you?

195
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:36,648
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
   - Okay.  

196
00:16:36,648 --> 00:16:39,006
  Action. Again.  

197
00:16:39,006 --> 00:16:41,131
  Again.  

198
00:16:41,131 --> 00:16:43,456
  Again. Cut.  

199
00:16:43,456 --> 00:16:47,936
  Again. Cut. Yes, this time...  

200
00:16:47,936 --> 00:16:50,226
  - Again. Again.   
 - Indian bop.

201
00:16:50,226 --> 00:16:52,826
Let's check.

202
00:16:52,826 --> 00:16:54,780
  Ready.  

203
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:01,920
 - Yes, again.   
 - I couldn't see it.
