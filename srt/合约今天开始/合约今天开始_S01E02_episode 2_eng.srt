1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,281
     

2
00:00:01,281 --> 00:00:02,327
What is this?

3
00:00:02,327 --> 00:00:04,491
      
 The song started, but where is the MR version?

4
00:00:04,491 --> 00:00:05,399
Hey, Lee Seungmin!

5
00:00:05,399 --> 00:00:06,926
You said you checked earlier.

6
00:00:06,926 --> 00:00:08,844
I definitely checked earlier...

7
00:00:08,844 --> 00:00:11,443
You are driving me crazy.

8
00:00:11,443 --> 00:00:14,815
If you don't have it, I can sing it without.

9
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:23,380
♫   That day I first met you  ♫

10
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:29,740
♫   Afterwards, every day, I  ♫

11
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:37,980
♫   Looked toward you  ♫

12
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,724
 That day I saw Oh Jina for the first time, she was breathtakingly awesome. 

13
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:44,960
♫   My mind that yearned for you  ♫

14
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,670
 I couldn't help but immediately fall in love with her. 

15
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,535
 But... 

16
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,230
You...

17
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:54,680
You have to be my boyfriend.

18
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,072
 What? Boyfriend? 

19
00:01:02,072 --> 00:01:05,596
 What did I hear just now? 

20
00:01:07,445 --> 00:01:08,235
Yes.

21
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:10,440
You're probably wondering what you've just heard.

22
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,814
I'm not just anybody after all.

23
00:01:12,814 --> 00:01:13,846
I'm Oh Jina.

24
00:01:13,846 --> 00:01:14,975
I know.

25
00:01:14,975 --> 00:01:17,929
Why would Oh Jina ask me...

26
00:01:17,929 --> 00:01:19,443
Do you have a girlfriend?

27
00:01:19,443 --> 00:01:21,463
No...

28
00:01:21,463 --> 00:01:23,922
That's good.

29
00:01:23,922 --> 00:01:26,455
So, what you are saying is...

30
00:01:26,455 --> 00:01:31,044
You are asking me out, right?

31
00:01:31,044 --> 00:01:32,209
Um...

32
00:01:32,209 --> 00:01:34,335
I guess you can say that.

33
00:01:34,335 --> 00:01:36,495
But what about Koo Hyungtak?

34
00:01:36,495 --> 00:01:38,321
I thought you two were in a relationship.

35
00:01:38,321 --> 00:01:41,521
We broke up this morning.

36
00:01:41,521 --> 00:01:43,334
Then... By any chance,

37
00:01:43,334 --> 00:01:46,479
did you break up because of me?

38
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,000
Because you like me?

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,530
What? Me like you? I just learned who you are today.

40
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:57,760
I just can't understand...

41
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,320
If you don't like me...

42
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,685
Why did you make the love confession?

43
00:02:01,685 --> 00:02:04,581
It's not a confession. It's a proposal.

44
00:02:04,581 --> 00:02:07,167
It will only be for a little while.

45
00:02:09,343 --> 00:02:10,528
Hm...

46
00:02:10,528 --> 00:02:12,475
So...

47
00:02:12,475 --> 00:02:16,484
You know how in some dramas, the main characters have a contract relationship?

48
00:02:16,484 --> 00:02:21,227
Just think of it as you being in a drama.

49
00:02:21,227 --> 00:02:25,681
So you're asking for a contractual relationship with me?

50
00:02:25,681 --> 00:02:28,384
Yes, that's right.

51
00:02:28,384 --> 00:02:29,310
Ah...

52
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,763
Can you do that for me?

53
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,860
Huh?

54
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,579
Well...

55
00:02:43,065 --> 00:02:44,425
I don't think so.

56
00:02:44,425 --> 00:02:46,027
What?

57
00:02:47,048 --> 00:02:48,518
No way!

58
00:02:48,518 --> 00:02:50,438
I was never this embarrassed in my life.

59
00:02:50,438 --> 00:02:51,847
I can't believe it.

60
00:02:51,847 --> 00:02:53,344
How dare he reject you?

61
00:02:53,344 --> 00:02:53,994
Ha...

62
00:02:53,994 --> 00:02:55,592
He should be super thankful.

63
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:56,741
What should we do then?

64
00:02:56,741 --> 00:03:00,014
You promised Koo Hyungtak that you would introduce him tomorrow.

65
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:01,865
Ah...

66
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,305
I mean...

67
00:03:05,305 --> 00:03:07,800
This doesn't make sense at all.

68
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,163
How dare you reject Jina?

69
00:03:09,163 --> 00:03:12,144
The most beautiful and awesome Jina from our school?

70
00:03:12,144 --> 00:03:15,239
Why? Why?

71
00:03:18,724 --> 00:03:19,508
I got it now.

72
00:03:19,508 --> 00:03:21,633
This is a hidden camera prank.

73
00:03:21,633 --> 00:03:23,333
It was a good hidden camera, friend.

74
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:24,850
Where is the camera?

75
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,460
Bring it now.

76
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,635
Hey.

77
00:03:27,635 --> 00:03:30,735
I wish this were a hidden camera prank, too.

78
00:03:30,735 --> 00:03:31,935
OK.

79
00:03:31,935 --> 00:03:34,710
Fine. Let's say this is all real...

80
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,388
Why did you say no?

81
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:43,110
Is it because of that?

82
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,278
With your mom...

83
00:03:44,278 --> 00:03:46,273
The promise?

84
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:00,653
    

85
00:04:01,555 --> 00:04:03,770
Are you Lee Seungmin?

86
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:04,825
Yes.

87
00:04:04,825 --> 00:04:05,740
Wow.

88
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,585
Hello, hyung.

89
00:04:09,293 --> 00:04:11,258
Hey, friend, I'm sorry, but

90
00:04:11,258 --> 00:04:12,349
do I know you?

91
00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:15,168
You hit a home run in the last national game.

92
00:04:15,168 --> 00:04:18,060
I caught the ball and asked for your autograph then.

93
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,285
Don't you remember that?

94
00:04:20,285 --> 00:04:23,163
Wasn't that Choi Seunghyun?

95
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:25,190
That's right.

96
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:27,530
Yes, Choi Seunghyun.

97
00:04:29,072 --> 00:04:30,987
Sorry.

98
00:04:32,802 --> 00:04:35,702
I don't need to waste my time.

99
00:04:35,702 --> 00:04:37,977
You're not her boyfriend.

100
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:41,945
It's my first time seeing him so close.

101
00:04:41,945 --> 00:04:43,550
His body is so fit.

102
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,638
Should we go workout starting tomorrow?

103
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,205
The more I think about it, the more I can't believe it.

104
00:04:54,205 --> 00:04:55,985
Ha...

105
00:04:58,542 --> 00:04:59,462
What?

106
00:04:59,462 --> 00:05:01,343
Are you OK?

107
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,810
What?

108
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,115
What's this?

109
00:05:08,115 --> 00:05:10,780
Who took mine?

110
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,827
My bracelet!

111
00:05:11,827 --> 00:05:14,692
I left it here.

112
00:05:14,692 --> 00:05:17,261
Nothing is working out well today.

113
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:25,514
You're supposed to introduce me to your new boyfriend later.

114
00:05:25,514 --> 00:05:28,276
You didn't forget about it, right?

115
00:05:28,276 --> 00:05:29,770
What?

116
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:32,642
Did something come up and you can't introduce me to him?

117
00:05:32,642 --> 00:05:33,944
Nope.

118
00:05:33,944 --> 00:05:36,477
I will show him to you.

119
00:05:36,477 --> 00:05:38,733
See you after school at the stand.

120
00:05:38,733 --> 00:05:40,421
Okay.

121
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,400
Damn...

122
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,233
     

123
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,804
You can't come in the classroom.

124
00:05:59,804 --> 00:06:02,059
I just need a second. Please help me.

125
00:06:02,059 --> 00:06:05,834
I can't let him go.

126
00:06:05,834 --> 00:06:07,064
What are you doing, Lee Seungmin?

127
00:06:07,064 --> 00:06:08,856
Come out.

128
00:06:16,355 --> 00:06:17,890
- Hey, Lee Seungmin.
- Teacher!

129
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:20,183
- Lee Seungmin.
- Teacher!

130
00:06:23,351 --> 00:06:27,100
Sorry, but even if you make my heart flutter...

131
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,043
I won't change my mind...

132
00:06:28,043 --> 00:06:30,989
It has to be you. The contractual relationship.

133
00:06:30,989 --> 00:06:33,841
Let me tell you why.

134
00:06:33,841 --> 00:06:37,994
The reason why I broke up with Koo Hyungtak is...

135
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:45,480
You got it?

136
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,856
The reason why it has to be you?

137
00:06:47,856 --> 00:06:50,208
You might think I'm being demanding, but

138
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,533
I'm not that rude.

139
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,620
What?

140
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,452
Oh Jina, hereinafter referred to as "Party A," and Lee Seungmin, hereinafter referred to as "Party B," will start a contractual relationship.

141
00:07:07,452 --> 00:07:11,264
Article 1. The relationship period is 50 days.

142
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:16,599
Article 2. Every weekend, we will meet and take selfies together and make the picture as the profile picture.

143
00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:20,535
Article 3. If Oh Jina wants you, you need to be there.

144
00:07:20,535 --> 00:07:24,418
Article 4. Do not date other people during the contract period.

145
00:07:24,418 --> 00:07:30,363
Article 5. Do not fall in love during the contract period.

146
00:07:30,363 --> 00:07:31,875
Simple, right?

147
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:33,835
I wrote the things I wanted.

148
00:07:33,835 --> 00:07:35,524
You can tell me what you want.

149
00:07:35,524 --> 00:07:38,399
We need to be fair.

150
00:07:40,155 --> 00:07:42,135
Article 1 and 2 are OK, but...

151
00:07:42,135 --> 00:07:43,105
Article 3...

152
00:07:43,105 --> 00:07:44,991
I can't always be there whenever you want me.

153
00:07:44,991 --> 00:07:47,214
Why? I have to show him that I'm always with you.

154
00:07:47,214 --> 00:07:48,769
I am busy because I'm in the broadcasting club.

155
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:49,419
Hey, you!

156
00:07:49,419 --> 00:07:51,638
I guess we can eat lunch together.

157
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:54,153
You're so picky.

158
00:07:56,684 --> 00:08:00,022
And, if we decided to have a contractual relationship,

159
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:01,903
I won't call you "noona."

160
00:08:01,903 --> 00:08:02,653
What?

161
00:08:02,653 --> 00:08:05,480
If I call you "noona," I won't be a man to you.

162
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,927
Then, what will you call me?

163
00:08:11,015 --> 00:08:12,808
Jina.

164
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:21,208
OK, it's up to you.

165
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:25,560
   

166
00:08:27,566 --> 00:08:28,736
You have more?

167
00:08:28,736 --> 00:08:31,811
I will walk you home since you'll be my girlfriend.

168
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:33,907
OK, then it will be Article 7.

169
00:08:33,907 --> 00:08:34,557
And...

170
00:08:34,557 --> 00:08:37,047
And let's tell each other whenever you have a problem.

171
00:08:37,047 --> 00:08:38,932
I always wanted that.

172
00:08:38,932 --> 00:08:41,636
And we need matching couple items, too.

173
00:08:41,636 --> 00:08:44,654
You have so many things you want.

174
00:08:44,654 --> 00:08:47,775
OK, you can do everything you want.

175
00:08:49,067 --> 00:08:51,606
It's not like we're having a real relationship.

176
00:08:53,927 --> 00:08:56,324
Here, sign.

177
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:01,329
What now?

178
00:09:01,329 --> 00:09:04,016
What's the problem now?

179
00:09:06,155 --> 00:09:08,435
 When did you get so big, my son? 

180
00:09:08,435 --> 00:09:11,533
   
 I still need more time to grow. 

181
00:09:14,575 --> 00:09:19,043
 I think I lived my life so well. 

182
00:09:19,946 --> 00:09:22,033
 I raised my son so well. 

183
00:09:22,033 --> 00:09:23,947
 Right? 

184
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:35,000
 Even if I am not here with you in the future... 

185
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,030
 You always have to live an honest life. 

186
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,070
 You promise? 

187
00:09:46,965 --> 00:09:50,408
 OK... And please stop saying that. 

188
00:10:04,835 --> 00:10:05,965
I will give you 10 minutes.

189
00:10:05,965 --> 00:10:07,725
Sign it and come down.

190
00:10:07,725 --> 00:10:09,045
You have to be there.

191
00:10:09,045 --> 00:10:10,954
I trust you, OK?

192
00:10:18,331 --> 00:10:19,711
What is it? What?

193
00:10:19,711 --> 00:10:20,851
Did you sign the contract?

194
00:10:20,851 --> 00:10:22,356
You decided to do it?

195
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:24,458
Not yet...

196
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,676
Take pictures with Jina.

197
00:10:25,676 --> 00:10:26,591
Walk her home...

198
00:10:26,591 --> 00:10:28,558
Eat lunch together...

199
00:10:28,558 --> 00:10:29,651
Hey...

200
00:10:29,651 --> 00:10:31,651
This is definitely a miracle. More than getting 100% on the college entrance exam.

201
00:10:31,651 --> 00:10:32,931
Are you really going to miss this chance?

202
00:10:32,931 --> 00:10:34,588
I want to do it, too.

203
00:10:34,588 --> 00:10:36,023
You know...

204
00:10:36,023 --> 00:10:39,059
You know how much I like her.

205
00:10:39,059 --> 00:10:40,115
Hey, friend.

206
00:10:40,115 --> 00:10:42,962
Just think about it simply. You're genuine about this.

207
00:10:42,962 --> 00:10:44,945
That means it's real.

208
00:10:44,945 --> 00:10:46,868
This relationship, too.

209
00:10:48,312 --> 00:10:50,177
When are they coming?

210
00:10:50,177 --> 00:10:52,382
Just be patient.

211
00:10:54,485 --> 00:10:56,750
Jina is here.

212
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:02,700
Why are you alone?

213
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,968
Where's your new boyfriend?

214
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,270
He will come soon.

215
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,803
If he doesn't show up in 1 minute...

216
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:12,344
I will take that as we're back in the relationship.

217
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,800
 If only I genuinely mean it... 

218
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,525
 Can this contract become a real relationship? 

219
00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:26,488
What should we do?

220
00:11:26,488 --> 00:11:28,786
It's been more than 1 minute.

221
00:11:28,786 --> 00:11:31,861
Let's make up, OK?

222
00:11:31,861 --> 00:11:33,641
Stop it, Koo Hyungtak.

223
00:11:33,641 --> 00:11:36,749
Jina doesn't want you.

224
00:11:36,749 --> 00:11:38,610
Ha...

225
00:11:42,485 --> 00:11:43,710
 Then... 

226
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:47,037
 I will take this awesome chance and 

227
00:11:47,037 --> 00:11:50,420
 I will start this contractual relationship from today. 

228
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,545
Jina.

229
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,931
I will never disappoint you ever again.

230
00:11:54,931 --> 00:11:56,616
Huh?

231
00:11:56,616 --> 00:11:58,754
Please don't be mad.

232
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:03,380
Jina.

233
00:12:15,925 --> 00:12:17,870
What?

234
00:12:23,615 --> 00:12:27,376
Hello, this is Jina's boyfriend, Lee Seungmin.

235
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:35,190
 This relationship will become real anyway. 

236
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:37,770
   

237
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:45,980


238
00:12:47,397 --> 00:12:50,520
    
 A shocking real story.  

239
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,052
  Did you try to avoid me? 

240
00:12:53,052 --> 00:12:54,945
  Be careful.  

241
00:13:05,549 --> 00:13:07,500
