1
00:00:05,181 --> 00:00:10,006
 Nothing is better than being honest. 

2
00:00:10,006 --> 00:00:16,190
   

3
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:26,350
 So I've decided on a way to get past this crisis. 

4
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:33,990


5
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,152
 Hello, 

6
00:00:35,152 --> 00:00:37,392
 students of Hwayang High. 

7
00:00:37,392 --> 00:00:39,389
 This is Lee Seungmin. 

8
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:47,832
 I have something to tell you about the rumors concerning Oh Jina lately. 

9
00:00:47,832 --> 00:00:50,579
 First of all, 

10
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:53,900
as you all know, Jina and I are in a contract relationship.

11
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,320
- Contract relationship? 
 - Contract relationship?

12
00:00:57,438 --> 00:01:02,838
 And I...   didn't want to go through with this contract.

13
00:01:07,207 --> 00:01:08,874
What?

14
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,600
What?

15
00:01:15,026 --> 00:01:20,411
 Because with Jina,   I didn't want a fake contract. I wanted to date her for real.

16
00:01:20,411 --> 00:01:25,181
 And it's also true that Jina had the upper hand in our relationship. 

17
00:01:25,181 --> 00:01:30,935
 But only because I liked her a lot more than she liked me. 

18
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:37,190
 In all relationships, the person who likes the other more is at a disadvantage. 

19
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:39,390
Really? He locked the door?

20
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,839
Open up. Open up before there's trouble.

21
00:01:41,839 --> 00:01:43,637
Hey! Open up!

22
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:48,617
She did call me out all the time, and she did kiss me out of the blue.

23
00:01:48,617 --> 00:01:51,220
 I was so bewildered. 

24
00:01:52,315 --> 00:01:55,595
 I was so nervous that my legs almost gave out. 

25
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:04,380
 If it weren't for this contract, I would have just had a crush on her. 

26
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,201
 In that sense, 

27
00:02:06,201 --> 00:02:10,864
 the contract that you've all read around the school was the best opportunity I've had. 

28
00:02:12,455 --> 00:02:15,870
 So, if it's okay with you, 

29
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:23,350
 please stop criticizing Jina and support my love for her instead. 

30
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:28,328
So that we can start a real relationship after our contract is terminated.

31
00:02:28,328 --> 00:02:29,986
He's such a romantic.

32
00:02:29,986 --> 00:02:31,516
- He's awesome. 
 - Yeah.

33
00:02:31,516 --> 00:02:33,076
So cool.

34
00:02:33,076 --> 00:02:35,790
- A round of applause! 
 - A round of applause.

35
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,550
A round of applause.

36
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,367
That idiot.

37
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:55,395
Even if everyone else hates me,

38
00:02:55,395 --> 00:02:58,763
if I have that one person who sincerely loves me, I'll be okay.

39
00:02:58,763 --> 00:03:01,072
Just like now.

40
00:03:01,072 --> 00:03:03,285
So do whatever you want.

41
00:03:03,285 --> 00:03:07,043
I won't cave in.

42
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,248
 Lastly, 

43
00:03:19,248 --> 00:03:23,597
I apologize for using the school's equipment like this for my own personal use.

44
00:03:23,597 --> 00:03:27,389
And thank you for listening.

45
00:03:34,837 --> 00:03:35,615
Come here, come here.

46
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:38,090
Is the school broadcasting system yours?

47
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:39,276
Do you want some balloons to go with it?

48
00:03:39,276 --> 00:03:41,181
- Come here, you. 
 - I'm so sorry. Huh?

49
00:03:41,181 --> 00:03:43,671
Lee Seungmin.

50
00:03:43,671 --> 00:03:44,637
I'll go to your classroom later.

51
00:03:44,637 --> 00:03:46,933
Where do you think you're going to go? You're headed to the teachers' office now.

52
00:03:46,933 --> 00:03:48,891
Come here, you.

53
00:04:07,668 --> 00:04:11,665
   

54
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:15,080
He's got it all wrong.

55
00:04:15,965 --> 00:04:18,569
Does he think that he's the only one who wishes this were real...

56
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,582
   

57
00:04:29,486 --> 00:04:33,170
 After that, the rumors concerning us quieted down 

58
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:36,890
 and people started to root for our contract relationship. 

59
00:04:36,896 --> 00:04:37,996
Wow. Jina,

60
00:04:37,996 --> 00:04:40,259
are you two glued to each other now that you're really going to date?

61
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:41,032
 We're rooting for you. 

62
00:04:41,032 --> 00:04:42,498
 I hope you two will be a couple for a long time. 

63
00:04:42,498 --> 00:04:45,371
Oh, my gosh! We're rooting for you!

64
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,300
 I'm hungry. What should we eat? 

65
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,176
 And... 

66
00:04:54,838 --> 00:04:58,862
 Hanna stopped coming to school. 

67
00:05:12,465 --> 00:05:15,105
How many laps do you have left?

68
00:05:15,105 --> 00:05:17,835
Eighty laps.

69
00:05:17,835 --> 00:05:20,540
You didn't play by the rules, so you deserve this.

70
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,345
I know.

71
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,795
Did you take care of what you wanted to do that day?

72
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,020
 That was the first day ever 

73
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:38,951
 picking Jina over baseball. 

74
00:05:38,951 --> 00:05:41,050
 The whole time I was running, 

75
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:48,936
 I realized that my heart was always Jina's. 

76
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,840
   

77
00:05:53,840 --> 00:06:01,020
 Please stop criticizing Jina and support my love for her instead. 

78
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:05,065
 So that we can start a real relationship. 

79
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:09,060
 But I was late once again. 

80
00:06:10,915 --> 00:06:17,080
 And Jina's heart was already someone else's. 

81
00:06:29,007 --> 00:06:32,122
As long as you tried your best.

82
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:06,190
Why aren't you coming to school?

83
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:08,610
Why do you care?

84
00:07:12,595 --> 00:07:16,125
I'm still really mad at you,

85
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:19,410
but I forgot to say this to you. So here I am.

86
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:28,500
If you had a hard time because of me all that time, I'm sorry.

87
00:07:30,203 --> 00:07:32,563
So please come back to school.

88
00:07:32,563 --> 00:07:34,521
Let's go back to how things used to be.

89
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:35,751
Don't play it all cool.

90
00:07:35,751 --> 00:07:37,906
You're right. I am playing it cool.

91
00:07:37,906 --> 00:07:39,982
But we're still friends. What choice do I have?

92
00:07:39,982 --> 00:07:43,915
I'm going to believe what everyone says about friends fighting

93
00:07:43,915 --> 00:07:45,801
and give making up a chance.

94
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,950
   

95
00:07:54,244 --> 00:07:57,054
   

96
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,800
   

97
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:15,733
"Jina! Let's really date, starting today."

98
00:08:17,552 --> 00:08:19,290
No, no.

99
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,407
"Oh Jina,"

100
00:08:20,407 --> 00:08:23,458
"let's date, starting today."

101
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:26,378
Oh. No, no.

102
00:08:26,378 --> 00:08:29,320
"Are you my girlfriend?"

103
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,559
What?

104
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:36,109
Where have I heard this before?

105
00:08:47,303 --> 00:08:49,303
"I love you."

106
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,925
No, no, no.

107
00:08:54,925 --> 00:08:56,521
This is really hard.

108
00:08:56,521 --> 00:08:59,476
What do I do?

109
00:08:59,476 --> 00:09:01,318
I don't know.

110
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,498
 What is this? A video? 

111
00:09:29,498 --> 00:09:32,009
 - Didn't you know? 
 - Come on! 

112
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:34,156
 You dummy. 

113
00:09:37,826 --> 00:09:40,510
 I have one condition. 

114
00:09:41,305 --> 00:09:42,697
 "Condition"? 

115
00:09:42,697 --> 00:09:49,440
 After the contract is terminated, don't date Lee Seungmin. 

116
00:09:53,305 --> 00:09:55,965
 Why is that the condition? 

117
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,770
 Because I like him. 

118
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:06,730
 You should give up at least one thing. 

119
00:10:08,445 --> 00:10:14,629
 Then I'll try to forget all the bad thoughts I had about you 

120
00:10:14,629 --> 00:10:17,745
 and go back to being good friends. 

121
00:10:26,545 --> 00:10:31,721
  
Good night. 

122
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,130
   

123
00:11:01,668 --> 00:11:03,120
You scared me.

124
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,830
Let's play hooky from school today.

125
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,965
 I didn't see Jina today. 
   

126
00:11:16,965 --> 00:11:18,285
 She's not answering my calls. 

127
00:11:18,285 --> 00:11:20,810
 They must be together. 

128
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,487
 This date is really nice. 

129
00:11:22,487 --> 00:11:24,827
 Let's do this once a week from now on. 

130
00:11:24,827 --> 00:11:26,258
 What happens to the main characters? 

131
00:11:26,258 --> 00:11:27,138
 They break up. 

132
00:11:27,138 --> 00:11:27,888
 Isn't it fun? 

133
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:28,938
 I don't like those endings. 

134
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,058
 Are they really breaking up? 

135
00:11:30,058 --> 00:11:31,730
 I told her to. 

136
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:32,535
 Are you sure you asked? 

137
00:11:32,535 --> 00:11:34,147
 And didn't threaten her? 

138
00:11:34,147 --> 00:11:36,830
 How did you like it all? 

139
00:11:45,595 --> 00:11:47,600
