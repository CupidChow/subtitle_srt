1
00:00:00,656 --> 00:00:03,220
Jina.

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:06,165
I will never disappoint you ever again.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,980
Please don't be mad.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,620
Jina.

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,770
♫  Ya, you know we’re so different  ♫

6
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:28,100
♫  I’m just the way I am  ♫

7
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,140
♫  Ya, you know we’re so different  ♫

8
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,970
Hello. I'm Lee Seungmin. Jina's boyfriend.

9
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,210
♫  I’m just the way I am  ♫

10
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:42,670


11
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:45,390
See? My boyfriend.

12
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,810
Let's get going. Our date.

13
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,700
Okay. Sure.

14
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,977
Bye.

15
00:01:09,657 --> 00:01:13,185
     

16
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:19,620
Oh, Ms. Hyojoo.

17
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,680
Lunch in Seongsu-dong? Tomorrow?

18
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,035
Good.

19
00:01:23,035 --> 00:01:26,480
I bet you'll wear high heels. I don't want you to walk for long.

20
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,300
I'll pick you up there.

21
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,985
See you tomorrow.

22
00:01:33,655 --> 00:01:36,030
Are you dating someone new? Again?

23
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,875
Dad, you're quite popular.

24
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:39,616
Of course.

25
00:01:39,616 --> 00:01:43,325
I know what women like.

26
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,660
Tell me, too.

27
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,835
What do girls like?

28
00:01:49,697 --> 00:01:53,149
My son. Why are you curious about that?

29
00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:55,260
Because... your son started dating.

30
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,245
Really?

31
00:01:57,245 --> 00:01:58,230
Who's the lucky girl?

32
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:02,040
- Who is she?
- Oh... Stop asking, please.

33
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,045
You've grown up.

34
00:02:05,451 --> 00:02:06,561
OK!

35
00:02:06,561 --> 00:02:08,970
I'll tell you everything.

36
00:02:13,474 --> 00:02:15,857
Oh! Seats are empty!

37
00:02:21,545 --> 00:02:24,445
You're so annoying. Get out of my way.

38
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:27,545
Sit down.

39
00:02:27,545 --> 00:02:29,195
Yes.

40
00:02:31,165 --> 00:02:33,810
Hanna, is that all you're having?

41
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:36,500
I've gained some extra weight, so I'm cutting down on carbs.

42
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,860
Wow. Amazing.

43
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:48,530
Oh... should I have bought kimchi dumplings?

44
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,500
 First of all, 

45
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,300
 if you're starting to see someone, bring her to all the must-eat restaurants. 

46
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,260
 Why? 

47
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:58,355
 Eating what she likes together will give you extra points. 

48
00:03:05,595 --> 00:03:06,746
Are these...

49
00:03:06,746 --> 00:03:08,155
kimchi dumplings?

50
00:03:08,155 --> 00:03:09,738
Yes.

51
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,190
You don't need to do this.

52
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:16,835
- Did I score some points?
- No.

53
00:03:16,835 --> 00:03:18,650
This is usual for me.

54
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:21,570
Then, I'll eat them alone.

55
00:03:24,475 --> 00:03:26,590
Thank you!

56
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,360
 Announcement from the broadcasting club. 

57
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,355
 Student Lee Seungmin. Please come quickly to the club. 

58
00:03:38,355 --> 00:03:40,320
     

59
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,700
Because of the lunch broadcast... I should go now.

60
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,230
See you.

61
00:04:00,948 --> 00:04:02,983
See you tomorrow!

62
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,580
Shocking news!

63
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,800
You're over-reacting again.

64
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,820
Finally, Tik Tak club is open!

65
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:12,780
Real?

66
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,530
Other students begged for 3 years, but the school said no!

67
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:17,000
Who made the impossible possible?

68
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,838
It's me. Oh Bawool.

69
00:04:18,838 --> 00:04:20,265
Congratulations.

70
00:04:20,265 --> 00:04:21,685
So, where's the club room?

71
00:04:21,685 --> 00:04:23,080
Let me show you.

72
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,720
Let's go! I'll treat you to a burger, too!

73
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,960
Not now.

74
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,640
Why?

75
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,650
Why is my best friend killing the mood?

76
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,551
I should treat you with this!

77
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,100
Surprised.

78
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,900
What are you doing?

79
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,970
Article 7.

80
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,935
- Taking you home.
- Oh, my.

81
00:04:51,935 --> 00:04:54,753
Never mind. I'm not going home.

82
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,680
 You need to be a cool guy, who's not clingy. 

83
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,060
 If you let her go, pretending you're not disappointed, 

84
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,835
 she'll come back to you. 

85
00:05:03,835 --> 00:05:05,630
Why is he working so hard suddenly?

86
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:08,045
He played hard to get before signing.

87
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,720
 She's really coming back. 

88
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,435
 What my dad said was true. 

89
00:05:19,435 --> 00:05:21,339
Let's go together.

90
00:05:21,339 --> 00:05:22,935
OK.

91
00:05:25,715 --> 00:05:27,390
What was that?

92
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,760
Did you avoid me?

93
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,650
Does it look like I'm avoiding you?

94
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:33,940
Let's go, Seungmin.

95
00:05:43,235 --> 00:05:44,230
I can't do this.

96
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,562
Let's go with me.

97
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:51,840
   

98
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,540
I guess it's necessary to know more about you.

99
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:57,945
Because Hyungtak suspects us.

100
00:05:57,945 --> 00:05:59,135
Did you finish?

101
00:05:59,135 --> 00:06:00,781
Yes.

102
00:06:07,505 --> 00:06:09,760
Your favorite food is Mala stew?

103
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,080
We have something in common.

104
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,776
I like spicy food.

105
00:06:13,776 --> 00:06:15,105
You were born in Jeju Island?

106
00:06:15,105 --> 00:06:16,455
I thought you were from Seoul.

107
00:06:16,455 --> 00:06:18,865
Your MBTI type is INFP?

108
00:06:18,865 --> 00:06:21,350
Oh, right. You seemed so.

109
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,525
When I suggested this,

110
00:06:22,525 --> 00:06:24,112
you were too hesitant.

111
00:06:24,112 --> 00:06:26,100
It's not because I'm hesitant.

112
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,040
It's because I'm thoughtful.

113
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:31,440
Oh!

114
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,670
It says ENTP and INFP match together well.

115
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,797
Good.

116
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:38,975
Your ideal type is "Girlfriend?"

117
00:06:38,975 --> 00:06:40,840
Do you like the K-pop band "GFRIEND?"

118
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,434
Oh, that's...

119
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:42,634
Me, too!

120
00:06:42,634 --> 00:06:45,960
Their song "Me Gustas Tu" is a great song.

121
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,475
I'm not talking about them.

122
00:06:52,225 --> 00:06:53,900
I need to go to the dance studio.

123
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,070
I'll read the rest at home.

124
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,840
OK. I'll go to the studio later.

125
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,380
To take you home.

126
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,820
It'll take long.

127
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,435
Will it be okay?

128
00:07:02,435 --> 00:07:04,488
Yes!

129
00:07:04,488 --> 00:07:06,080
OK.

130
00:07:08,775 --> 00:07:11,740
     

131
00:07:20,325 --> 00:07:21,835
You're late.

132
00:07:21,835 --> 00:07:23,455
Yeah.

133
00:07:23,455 --> 00:07:26,579
I had to talk with Lee Seungmin.

134
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,065
Well,

135
00:07:29,065 --> 00:07:31,335
will it be okay with him?

136
00:07:31,335 --> 00:07:32,520
About what?

137
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,320
It's a mere contractual relationship.

138
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,140
You could've chosen a better-looking, nicer guy.

139
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,985
You happened to pick him out from the bulletin board.

140
00:07:39,985 --> 00:07:42,304
Isn't it weird to date him?

141
00:07:42,304 --> 00:07:44,220
What should I do?

142
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:47,565
Hyungtak saw his name and face.

143
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:52,265
He's too ordinary. You deserve better than that.

144
00:07:52,265 --> 00:07:54,550
That's a compliment, right?

145
00:08:03,945 --> 00:08:06,530
Let's see how you've practiced.

146
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,400
Aren't you going?

147
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,980
I'll practice a bit more.

148
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:14,870
OK.

149
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,355
I'm leaving now.

150
00:08:16,355 --> 00:08:18,574
See you tomorrow.

151
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,560
You really waited for me.

152
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,835
Because it's an article of our contract.

153
00:08:30,835 --> 00:08:33,300
Isn't it hard to practice as a trainee?

154
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,280
It's tough.

155
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,848
But it's doable.

156
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,080
Since when did you start doing this?

157
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,485
It wasn't in the list of 100 questions and answers.

158
00:08:40,485 --> 00:08:42,430
Since I was in 8th grade...

159
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,908
So for 3 or 4 years.

160
00:08:48,149 --> 00:08:50,374
Watch out!

161
00:09:01,355 --> 00:09:03,789
I was going to step back.

162
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:08,350
The traffic light is broken.

163
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:10,755
It's been so long.

164
00:09:10,755 --> 00:09:13,109
It can be dangerous.

165
00:09:13,109 --> 00:09:15,060
Why don't you call the community service center?

166
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,025
To fix it.

167
00:09:17,025 --> 00:09:19,073
No need.

168
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,800
Let's cross.

169
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:35,040
I'm almost there. My home.

170
00:09:36,184 --> 00:09:37,485
OK.

171
00:09:37,485 --> 00:09:39,750
See you tomorrow.

172
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,204
Hey, wait.

173
00:09:41,204 --> 00:09:42,820
Yes?

174
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,015
Give it to me first.

175
00:09:44,015 --> 00:09:45,939
Your mobile number.

176
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:48,850
Well,

177
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:52,393
just in case Hyungtak asks.

178
00:10:05,645 --> 00:10:07,880
- Can I send you a message after I arrive at home? 
 - Nope.

179
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,760
I'm going to bed.

180
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,416
OK.

181
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:14,629
Then...

182
00:10:14,629 --> 00:10:16,580
Good night, Jina.

183
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,660
What the?

184
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,040
    
 Lee Seungmin will be here in minutes. 

185
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,715
  Why did you call him when we're hanging out?  

186
00:10:41,715 --> 00:10:43,639
  Get out of my way.  

187
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:46,780
  - If you mess around with him...
- If I do?  

188
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:47,990
  What are you going to do?  

189
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:50,460
  I'll kill you.  

190
00:10:58,054 --> 00:11:00,867
     

191
00:11:03,975 --> 00:11:06,125
  Oh, right.  

192
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:09,005
  I forgot telling him the most important thing.  

193
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:14,420
  If you genuinely care about the girl you like,  

194
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:18,000
  she will feel that genuineness, too.
