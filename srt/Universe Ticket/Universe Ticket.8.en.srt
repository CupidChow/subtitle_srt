00:00:14,202 --> 00:00:16,143
Who will achieve the PRISM level first...

7
00:00:16,143 --> 00:00:18,943
and debut as the Top Eight?

00:02:42,552 --> 00:02:45,093
The Final Round is next.

39
00:02:45,323 --> 00:02:46,693
It will be really competitive.

40
00:02:46,693 --> 00:02:49,093
It will be a legendary competition.

41
00:02:49,093 --> 00:02:52,163
I will use all my strength to put on my performance.

42
00:02:53,063 --> 00:02:55,633
(Unit Station, D-day)

43
00:02:55,832 --> 00:02:57,432
(Contestant Waiting Room)

44
00:02:57,672 --> 00:03:00,202
Promotion is important at this moment.

45
00:03:00,372 --> 00:03:02,473
I must show who I am when I am given the chance.

46
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:05,913
I want to show off different charms than from before.

47
00:03:06,142 --> 00:03:08,513
I want to reach Level P.

48
00:03:10,082 --> 00:03:11,452
Road to PRISM.

49
00:03:12,182 --> 00:03:13,983
The promotion battle to reach the PRISM level.

50
00:03:14,753 --> 00:03:15,793
Unit Station.

51
00:03:17,753 --> 00:03:21,093
Only the 24 survivors from the 1st Promotion Ceremony...

52
00:03:21,223 --> 00:03:24,962
have earned the opportunity to perform during this Unit Station.

53
00:03:26,033 --> 00:03:27,563
In Unit Station,

54
00:03:27,563 --> 00:03:30,133
there will be Position Unit and New Song Unit performances...

55
00:03:30,133 --> 00:03:31,932
that will decide promotion and elimination.

56
00:03:32,543 --> 00:03:34,642
Promotion will be earned through the Position Unit.

57
00:03:35,043 --> 00:03:37,642
Elimination will occur through the New Song Unit.

58
00:03:38,073 --> 00:03:39,383
(Promotion will be earned through the Position Unit.)

59
00:03:39,383 --> 00:03:41,182
(Elimination will occur through the New Song Unit.)

60
00:03:42,952 --> 00:03:43,983
I'm scared.

61
00:03:44,753 --> 00:03:46,652
Who will survive...

62
00:03:46,652 --> 00:03:49,323
and earn the chance to perform during Final Station?

63
00:03:49,853 --> 00:03:52,522
We will start Unit Station now.

64
00:03:52,522 --> 00:03:55,462
(The first Unit Station, Position Unit starts now.)

65
00:03:55,462 --> 00:03:56,462
It's starting.

66
00:03:59,202 --> 00:04:00,202
I feel nervous.

67
00:04:01,763 --> 00:04:03,533
- Hello. - Hello.

68
00:04:04,103 --> 00:04:05,133
Hello.

69
00:04:05,133 --> 00:04:06,402
(The girls have gathered again after the Level Station.)

70
00:04:06,402 --> 00:04:07,443
What do we do?

71
00:04:07,742 --> 00:04:09,573
- Amazing. - What is this?

72
00:04:09,573 --> 00:04:10,672
(Surprised)

73
00:04:11,473 --> 00:04:13,283
(Why are the girls so surprised?)

74
00:04:13,283 --> 00:04:14,783
- What is that? - What is that?

75
00:04:15,853 --> 00:04:16,913
What is that?

76
00:04:17,112 --> 00:04:18,853
- What is that? - What is that?

77
00:04:19,052 --> 00:04:20,223
Look at that.

78
00:04:20,223 --> 00:04:21,953
- What is that? - No way.

79
00:04:21,953 --> 00:04:23,422
- That's insane. - Performance!

80
00:04:23,422 --> 00:04:25,353
- Performance! - There's a Visual category too.

81
00:04:25,963 --> 00:04:27,262
I'm scared.

82
00:04:27,262 --> 00:04:29,663
I don't like these things. I'm scared.

83
00:04:30,132 --> 00:04:32,393
It must be a battle between different concepts.

84
00:04:33,103 --> 00:04:34,362
Hey!

85
00:04:34,533 --> 00:04:37,473
What will we be doing? I'm so curious.

86
00:04:39,773 --> 00:04:40,973
Who will it be?

87
00:04:41,742 --> 00:04:42,773
Everyone!

88
00:04:43,572 --> 00:04:44,572
Everyone!

89
00:04:46,682 --> 00:04:49,283
The second station of Road to PRISM.

90
00:04:49,612 --> 00:04:51,783
In Unit Station,

91
00:04:52,283 --> 00:04:54,353
there will be Vocal, Performance, and Visual units.

92
00:04:54,822 --> 00:04:56,723
You will be divided into three units...

93
00:04:56,723 --> 00:04:58,953
and perform for the Position Unit.

94
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,762
So that becomes a unit.

95
00:05:03,992 --> 00:05:07,432
In Unit Station, only one MVP from each Position Unit...

96
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:08,733
- Only 1 person. - Only 1 person...

97
00:05:09,203 --> 00:05:11,733
can advance to the Unicorn Ticketing.

98
00:05:12,172 --> 00:05:15,203
The competition will be intense.

99
00:05:15,203 --> 00:05:17,112
Only one person can get promoted.

100
00:05:17,213 --> 00:05:20,742
I thought this could become a bloody battle.

101
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:23,112
Just one? That's too little.

102
00:05:23,353 --> 00:05:24,682
I couldn't believe it.

103
00:05:25,413 --> 00:05:26,752
It will be really competitive.

104
00:05:26,752 --> 00:05:30,422
It will be a legendary competition. That came to my mind.

105
00:05:31,093 --> 00:05:33,262
At this moment,

106
00:05:33,992 --> 00:05:36,033
your positions will be decided.

107
00:05:38,293 --> 00:05:41,533
I saw the Visual category and really wanted to go there.

108
00:05:42,733 --> 00:05:45,403
I believe I suit the Visual and Vocal categories.

109
00:05:46,903 --> 00:05:48,973
(Mini-game to decide positions)

110
00:05:49,273 --> 00:05:51,372
(The units are divided into three positions.)

111
00:05:51,372 --> 00:05:54,043
(Each contestant will hold their photocard.)

112
00:05:54,043 --> 00:05:57,312
(They will start at the signal...)

113
00:05:58,283 --> 00:06:01,083
(and place the photocard on their desired position.)

114
00:06:01,453 --> 00:06:04,492
(They must pick their own position. What kind of units will we see?)

115
00:06:04,992 --> 00:06:06,862
It will be intense.

116
00:06:07,692 --> 00:06:10,362
Bae Yeram and Bae Haram must go for Performance.

117
00:06:11,132 --> 00:06:13,062
I really want Performance too.

118
00:06:13,062 --> 00:06:14,703
I want Performance too.

119
00:06:16,002 --> 00:06:17,703
Most of us must want Performance.

120
00:06:17,703 --> 00:06:20,302
Right. The Performance category will have a lot of competition.

121
00:06:20,302 --> 00:06:21,372
What do I do?

122
00:06:21,872 --> 00:06:23,713
There are so many girls with outstanding performances.

123
00:06:24,672 --> 00:06:28,682
- The Vocal category must be... - There are aces like Elisia.

124
00:06:28,882 --> 00:06:31,853
I think I would fit in Vocal more.

125
00:06:33,052 --> 00:06:34,483
I think I should go for the Visual category.

126
00:06:34,483 --> 00:06:35,953
But I'm not sure what that category is about.

127
00:06:36,593 --> 00:06:38,822
What kind of song will the Visual Unit sing?

128
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:40,663
- What's that position? - It's a bit...

129
00:06:40,663 --> 00:06:42,632
I can't guess what it could be.

130
00:06:43,593 --> 00:06:47,762
The ones who have achieved promotion will go first.

131
00:06:50,473 --> 00:06:52,132
They can decide comfortably.

132
00:06:52,132 --> 00:06:53,543
I felt quite jealous about that.

133
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:55,942
Let's go with the one leftover.

134
00:06:55,942 --> 00:06:57,843
I don't think we'll be able to choose.

135
00:06:58,112 --> 00:07:00,343
There are many girls in the front who fit the Visual category.

136
00:07:00,483 --> 00:07:02,682
Right. There's Nana, Gabi, and Gehlee.

137
00:07:04,853 --> 00:07:06,083
I'm feeling nervous again.

138
00:07:06,653 --> 00:07:07,922
Get ready.

139
00:07:08,283 --> 00:07:11,322
(What positions will the promoted ones choose?)

140
00:07:11,922 --> 00:07:16,062
I thought Performance was a given for me.

141
00:07:17,733 --> 00:07:22,833
It was great that I had the chance to choose first.

142
00:07:23,203 --> 00:07:25,372
But since there was no one in each unit before me,

143
00:07:25,372 --> 00:07:27,072
I felt a bit worried.

144
00:07:27,442 --> 00:07:30,242
(How will the ones with promotion start out the Position Units?)

145
00:07:35,382 --> 00:07:37,483
Everyone's going for Performance.

146
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,052
Hold on.

147
00:07:39,353 --> 00:07:40,682
No way.

148
00:07:42,953 --> 00:07:44,122
That can't happen.

149
00:07:44,953 --> 00:07:47,262
There are only five spots left for Performance.

150
00:07:47,963 --> 00:07:49,393
I won't be able to go there.

151
00:07:49,992 --> 00:07:51,932
Right in between the sisters.

152
00:07:51,932 --> 00:07:52,932
(Half of the ones with promotion chose the Performance category.)

153
00:07:55,562 --> 00:07:59,072
(Gehlee who was expected to choose Visual chooses Vocal.)

154
00:07:59,072 --> 00:08:00,872
I thought Gehlee would choose Visual.

155
00:08:02,603 --> 00:08:06,343
(Bang Yunha and Kim Sujin also choose the Vocal category.)

156
00:08:07,682 --> 00:08:10,153
(What is Nana's choice?)

157
00:08:10,153 --> 00:08:11,812
(Thinking)

158
00:08:14,182 --> 00:08:16,192
- Gosh, Nana. - Nana!

159
00:08:16,192 --> 00:08:17,293
(Nana was the only one who chose the Visual category.)

160
00:08:18,023 --> 00:08:20,492
- I agree with that decision. - Nana must go there.

161
00:08:21,093 --> 00:08:24,362
I thought Nana would choose the Performance category.

162
00:08:24,362 --> 00:08:27,103
Her decision was unexpected.

163
00:08:27,933 --> 00:08:29,703
I thought Gehlee would choose Visual.

164
00:08:29,703 --> 00:08:31,673
Me too. I thought she would choose Visual.

165
00:08:32,973 --> 00:08:35,872
I have the feeling that I wanted to nourish...

166
00:08:36,042 --> 00:08:38,272
the vocal talent that I had.

167
00:08:38,272 --> 00:08:41,382
And I feel like putting myself in the Vocal position...

168
00:08:41,382 --> 00:08:43,553
would really help me improve a lot more...

169
00:08:43,553 --> 00:08:45,683
and to step out of my comfort zone.

170
00:08:45,683 --> 00:08:47,853
(Visual)

171
00:08:47,853 --> 00:08:49,823
(Performance)

172
00:08:50,492 --> 00:08:53,193
(Vocal)

173
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:55,792
I'm still deciding between Vocal and Visual Unit.

174
00:08:55,792 --> 00:08:57,292
I'm a really slow runner. What do I do?

175
00:08:57,632 --> 00:08:59,093
Everyone suits Visual Unit.

176
00:08:59,933 --> 00:09:01,662
What to do? They're all pretty.

177
00:09:03,872 --> 00:09:06,343
Performance Unit will be filled up here.

178
00:09:06,772 --> 00:09:08,703
There are a lot of girls who suit Performance.

179
00:09:08,703 --> 00:09:11,073
- Girls like Jayla or Jinyeong. - For Visual...

180
00:09:11,242 --> 00:09:13,343
We just have to go with what's left.

181
00:09:15,042 --> 00:09:16,512
- Performance? - Will you choose Vocal, Sunwoo?

182
00:09:16,512 --> 00:09:18,652
- Won't you choose Vocal? - I do want Performance.

183
00:09:18,652 --> 00:09:20,353
- Performance? - I do want it.

184
00:09:20,983 --> 00:09:24,892
I thought it would be a good time to show my performance skills.

185
00:09:25,823 --> 00:09:29,862
I was torn between Vocal and Visual.

186
00:09:30,693 --> 00:09:33,733
Performance had a lot of competition.

187
00:09:33,933 --> 00:09:37,173
I didn't think Vocal suited me.

188
00:09:37,203 --> 00:09:39,103
I was just going to go for Visual.

189
00:09:39,443 --> 00:09:41,542
I hate these moments.

190
00:09:41,542 --> 00:09:43,973
Run!

191
00:09:48,512 --> 00:09:51,953
Three, two, one. Go!

192
00:09:53,522 --> 00:09:54,522
Go!

193
00:09:56,953 --> 00:09:59,463
(A combative moment to earn the wanted position)

194
00:09:59,463 --> 00:10:00,862
(Congested position area)

195
00:10:03,093 --> 00:10:05,162
- Is this your spot? - That was insane.

196
00:10:05,162 --> 00:10:06,233
(Lee Sunwoo got pushed out of the competition and chose Vocal.)

197
00:10:06,662 --> 00:10:07,933
I had no chance.

198
00:10:08,803 --> 00:10:11,872
I didn't expect that many girls to go for it.

199
00:10:12,032 --> 00:10:13,943
I did feel a bit flustered.

200
00:10:14,642 --> 00:10:16,473
Performance is filled up.

201
00:10:17,473 --> 00:10:20,012
The Performance Position has no empty spots.

202
00:10:20,213 --> 00:10:21,642
Performance is done.

203
00:10:21,642 --> 00:10:22,683
(The losing team feels lost with the close of Performance.)

204
00:10:22,683 --> 00:10:24,053
Visual has a lot of spots left.

205
00:10:24,652 --> 00:10:26,183
I didn't expect this.

206
00:10:26,323 --> 00:10:27,823
What do I do?

207
00:10:27,823 --> 00:10:29,252
(The losing team from Level Station goes last.)

208
00:10:29,423 --> 00:10:32,053
But I was in the Vocal category for the Revenge Battle.

209
00:10:32,522 --> 00:10:33,923
Also for the Level Station.

210
00:10:33,923 --> 00:10:36,463
- Should I choose Visual? - I thought the same thing.

211
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:39,933
I wanted Performance, to be honest.

212
00:10:40,233 --> 00:10:43,703
The winning team filled up all the spots.

213
00:10:45,272 --> 00:10:48,042
I'm confident. It's either Visual or Vocal now.

214
00:10:48,943 --> 00:10:50,912
I had a strong thought that a certain category was mine.

215
00:10:51,012 --> 00:10:52,573
- Seowon will go for Vocal. - We'll start right away.

216
00:10:52,573 --> 00:10:54,343
- What will they do? - Will Kotoko go for Visual?

217
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:55,713
I suppose.

218
00:10:56,813 --> 00:11:00,723
I wasn't confident with singing, so I went for Visual.

219
00:11:01,423 --> 00:11:04,392
(The only units with spots left are Vocal Unit and Visual Unit.)

220
00:11:04,492 --> 00:11:06,892
- We must run. - I have short legs.

221
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:14,603
(Which contestant will get their wanted position?)

222
00:11:16,063 --> 00:11:17,203
Go!

223
00:11:18,203 --> 00:11:19,233
Go!

224
00:11:33,853 --> 00:11:35,053
What happened to Sumin?

225
00:11:35,353 --> 00:11:37,292
Sumin chose Visual.

226
00:11:38,353 --> 00:11:39,492
Yoona chose Visual too.

227
00:11:40,193 --> 00:11:41,193
Yoona.

228
00:11:41,193 --> 00:11:46,032
(Visual)

229
00:11:46,632 --> 00:11:49,262
(Kotoko managed to get the Visual spot that she wanted.)

230
00:11:50,402 --> 00:11:52,573
Check out the Vocal lineup.

231
00:11:52,632 --> 00:11:54,173
- That's insane. - Vocal is insane.

232
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:55,902
That team is really strong.

233
00:11:56,742 --> 00:11:58,813
It'll be a close competition for everyone.

234
00:11:58,813 --> 00:12:00,512
(Vocal)

235
00:12:00,742 --> 00:12:02,282
What do we do?

236
00:12:03,183 --> 00:12:05,213
We're together again!

237
00:12:06,882 --> 00:12:09,483
I was a little nervous that I had to compete with...

238
00:12:09,553 --> 00:12:11,252
some of the vocalists there.

239
00:12:11,252 --> 00:12:13,323
They're extremely talented.

240
00:12:19,063 --> 00:12:21,203
(The intense Position Unit selection is now over.)

241
00:12:21,203 --> 00:12:23,002
(That night)

242
00:12:23,502 --> 00:12:26,103
I'm excited to hear what song we'll be doing.

243
00:12:26,372 --> 00:12:27,843
- Right? - Exactly.

244
00:12:27,843 --> 00:12:30,173
But since it's the Vocal Position,

245
00:12:30,173 --> 00:12:32,443
I hope the song will be really nice.

246
00:12:32,573 --> 00:12:34,912
- It's hard to guess what it is. - I think it'll be a hard one.

247
00:12:34,912 --> 00:12:35,983
It can't be predicted.

248
00:12:36,752 --> 00:12:39,252
We're all vocalists here.

249
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,882
Despite having great vocalists here,

250
00:12:41,882 --> 00:12:45,622
who do you think can take the main vocalist spot?

251
00:12:45,853 --> 00:12:47,022
I'm sure there are many who are capable of it.

252
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:48,693
I want your opinions.

253
00:12:48,693 --> 00:12:50,132
(Who do the girls think should be the main vocalist?)

254
00:12:50,132 --> 00:12:52,333
The main vocalist in your opinion.

255
00:12:53,502 --> 00:12:55,433
I think it's Sunwoo.

256
00:12:55,662 --> 00:12:58,902
I saw her sing the high notes for "Girls On Top."

257
00:12:59,032 --> 00:13:00,703
I thought it was amazing.

258
00:13:00,703 --> 00:13:01,872
Thank you.

259
00:13:02,203 --> 00:13:03,443
- This is embarrassing. - Right.

260
00:13:03,443 --> 00:13:05,142
- It's very embarrassing. - Exactly.

261
00:13:06,542 --> 00:13:10,752
I've always been called the main vocalist of main vocalists.

262
00:13:10,983 --> 00:13:13,882
So amongst these vocalists,

263
00:13:13,882 --> 00:13:16,593
I want to prove to everyone that I'm the best vocalist.

264
00:13:17,353 --> 00:13:20,622
If I think about the previous vocal performance,

265
00:13:20,622 --> 00:13:24,362
I believe Yunha's intro was very good.

266
00:13:24,362 --> 00:13:26,933
She has what it takes to become a great main vocalist.

267
00:13:27,662 --> 00:13:28,803
Thank you.

268
00:13:30,872 --> 00:13:32,473
I've had a lot of experience...

269
00:13:32,473 --> 00:13:36,042
as the main vocalist from previous performances.

270
00:13:36,042 --> 00:13:38,372
I feel the most confident for that reason.

271
00:13:38,542 --> 00:13:39,943
I think...

272
00:13:40,183 --> 00:13:41,642
it's Sunwoo.

273
00:13:42,683 --> 00:13:44,252
It's because...

274
00:13:44,252 --> 00:13:45,813
when I see her,

275
00:13:46,423 --> 00:13:50,492
the main vocalist position really suits her well.

276
00:13:51,252 --> 00:13:53,262
That's what I think.

277
00:13:53,693 --> 00:13:55,723
As a vocalist,

278
00:13:55,992 --> 00:13:58,662
people might hear me and say, "She's quite good."

279
00:13:58,992 --> 00:14:02,862
I think I have that level of talent.

280
00:14:03,502 --> 00:14:06,642
We all have different voices.

281
00:14:06,642 --> 00:14:09,713
(Tight war of nerves from the start before deciding the main vocalist)

282
00:14:10,142 --> 00:14:12,012
The Unicorn will reveal...

283
00:14:12,012 --> 00:14:13,612
What? There's more?

284
00:14:13,742 --> 00:14:15,612
She will reveal the song.

285
00:14:15,612 --> 00:14:16,853
(The Vocal Unit mission song finally gets revealed.)

286
00:14:16,853 --> 00:14:19,112
- Hold on. - Hold on!

287
00:14:19,112 --> 00:14:20,583
Is the song done by the Unicorn?

288
00:14:21,053 --> 00:14:22,152
- Okay. - Here we go.

289
00:14:22,183 --> 00:14:23,292
My goodness.

290
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:27,593
Hello. I'm Unicorn Younha.

291
00:14:27,792 --> 00:14:29,992
I predict that most of the ones who want to become the main vocalist...

292
00:14:29,992 --> 00:14:32,292
have gathered in this unit.

293
00:14:32,292 --> 00:14:33,532
It's Younha.

294
00:14:33,703 --> 00:14:35,803
The Vocal Unit's mission song is...

295
00:14:36,262 --> 00:14:38,233
"Beautiful" by Wanna One.

296
00:14:38,233 --> 00:14:40,843
(Vocal Unit mission song: "Beautiful" by Wanna One)

297
00:14:43,412 --> 00:14:46,142
- Wanna One? - Beautiful

298
00:14:47,242 --> 00:14:54,152
(A track with a heartrending melody with sentimental voices)

299
00:14:54,252 --> 00:14:59,593
(Producer PAPERMAKER will rearrange "Beautiful.")

300
00:15:00,723 --> 00:15:05,362
(How will the Vocal Unit's "Beautiful" sound?)

301
00:15:07,203 --> 00:15:09,803
- Wanna One? - Beautiful

302
00:15:10,272 --> 00:15:12,772
I didn't expect it to be a song by Wanna One.

303
00:15:12,902 --> 00:15:15,843
It had more of a heartrending feel.

304
00:15:16,042 --> 00:15:17,512
I thought, "That's mine."

305
00:15:19,542 --> 00:15:22,412
I thought that this is my chance to...

306
00:15:22,412 --> 00:15:24,453
really show more of what I've got.

307
00:15:25,112 --> 00:15:27,823
- The parts... - One Performance, one Visual.

308
00:15:27,823 --> 00:15:29,183
There won't be many parts.

309
00:15:29,183 --> 00:15:32,152
We're all vocalists.

310
00:15:32,152 --> 00:15:36,362
I thought it would get intense with the vocal parts.

311
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,693
I've seen the Visual category for the first time.

312
00:15:39,693 --> 00:15:40,933
- Me too. - Right.

313
00:15:40,933 --> 00:15:42,132
What will they do there?

314
00:15:42,132 --> 00:15:44,532
It's true that someone will be in charge of the looks.

315
00:15:44,532 --> 00:15:46,703
But what will they do as a group?

316
00:15:46,803 --> 00:15:48,002
- Right. - Well...

317
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:50,313
It's not like they'll put on a fashion show.

318
00:15:50,313 --> 00:15:51,742
It's hard to predict what they'll do.

319
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,713
I have no idea what song they'll do.

320
00:15:54,542 --> 00:15:57,813
(The girls with the best looks have gathered as the Visual Unit.)

321
00:16:00,323 --> 00:16:03,122
(The girl from the first teaser, Hwang Sieun)

322
00:16:03,122 --> 00:16:06,923
(Her confident looks grab attention.)

323
00:16:10,233 --> 00:16:12,963
(The contestants' favorite from the Candy Ticketing)

324
00:16:12,963 --> 00:16:16,362
(Nana)

325
00:16:16,603 --> 00:16:19,772
(The visual center that you can't take your eyes off of)

326
00:16:23,412 --> 00:16:29,542
(The one adored by all contestants, Kotoko)

327
00:16:31,612 --> 00:16:34,953
(The girls with the best looks have gathered in one place.)

328
00:16:35,152 --> 00:16:36,752
We're all so pretty.

329
00:16:38,053 --> 00:16:39,292
We all are.

330
00:16:40,063 --> 00:16:42,593
There were various types of people.

331
00:16:42,593 --> 00:16:45,862
The pretty ones, the cute ones,

332
00:16:46,292 --> 00:16:49,362
and the cool ones.

333
00:16:49,362 --> 00:16:52,573
It made me wonder what kind of team we could become.

334
00:16:53,132 --> 00:16:55,872
What do you think the Visual Unit is?

335
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:01,042
I think the Visual Unit should catch the viewers' attention.

336
00:17:01,213 --> 00:17:03,312
- That's what I think. - Right.

337
00:17:03,413 --> 00:17:06,282
A team that everyone remembers.

338
00:17:08,052 --> 00:17:13,322
(The mission song for the unit that must capture attention)

339
00:17:17,762 --> 00:17:20,203
Hello. I'm Unicorn Kim Se Jeong.

340
00:17:20,502 --> 00:17:22,903
This is the mission song that will help you...

341
00:17:22,903 --> 00:17:24,703
show off your great looks.

342
00:17:25,703 --> 00:17:28,373
It's "Catallena" by Orange Caramel.

343
00:17:28,373 --> 00:17:30,913
(Visual Unit mission song: "Catallena" by Orange Caramel)

344
00:17:32,643 --> 00:17:33,782
(It's a song with a unique theme and dance moves.)

345
00:17:33,782 --> 00:17:36,613
("Catallena" will be remade by the producer PAPERMAKER.)

346
00:17:37,113 --> 00:17:41,282
I thought we'd perform a song with pretty dance moves.

347
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:43,653
It was unexpected. I didn't see this coming.

348
00:17:44,923 --> 00:17:46,292
Well...

349
00:17:46,292 --> 00:17:48,792
I didn't think it'd be easy.

350
00:17:49,123 --> 00:17:51,363
I was a little flustered.

351
00:17:51,433 --> 00:17:54,002
It was completely different...

352
00:17:54,002 --> 00:17:55,762
from the concept I had in mind.

353
00:17:56,772 --> 00:17:58,272
- Is that it? - Yes.

354
00:17:58,272 --> 00:17:59,633
Is this the song?

355
00:18:00,542 --> 00:18:03,173
(Kotoko is aware of the highlight of "Catallena.")

356
00:18:05,512 --> 00:18:09,582
It's a song with the vibe I like.

357
00:18:09,883 --> 00:18:13,782
So it makes me confident.

358
00:18:13,782 --> 00:18:19,352
I think I'll be able to pull it off well.

359
00:18:20,562 --> 00:18:23,223
I think this song...

360
00:18:23,223 --> 00:18:26,532
is perfect for Kotoko,

361
00:18:26,532 --> 00:18:27,963
so she's my rival.

362
00:18:28,203 --> 00:18:31,102
I believe I can do this...

363
00:18:31,102 --> 00:18:33,403
if I try my best without negative thoughts.

364
00:18:34,742 --> 00:18:37,613
(Kotoko and Nana met again after Candy Ticketing.)

365
00:18:37,613 --> 00:18:39,742
(Which one will be promoted?)

366
00:18:39,812 --> 00:18:42,782
(At that moment, in another practice room)

367
00:18:43,752 --> 00:18:45,413
(Showing off their performances)

368
00:18:45,413 --> 00:18:46,483
Thank you.

369
00:18:50,123 --> 00:18:52,953
(It's tense from the beginning for the Performance Unit.)

370
00:18:52,953 --> 00:18:54,322
- Nice. - My gosh.

371
00:18:54,322 --> 00:18:55,492
Nice.

372
00:18:55,992 --> 00:19:00,032
I think those who deserve to come here came.

373
00:19:00,032 --> 00:19:05,403
They all showed something impressive with their dance.

374
00:19:05,532 --> 00:19:08,973
I think I should stay alert and try hard.

375
00:19:09,302 --> 00:19:11,512
I'll tell you the song you will be performing.

376
00:19:11,512 --> 00:19:15,183
(The mission song for Performance Unit is revealed.)

377
00:19:15,183 --> 00:19:16,282
Okay.

378
00:19:16,282 --> 00:19:17,683
One, two, three.

379
00:19:18,552 --> 00:19:21,082
The mission song for Performance Unit is...

380
00:19:24,322 --> 00:19:26,193
"LOCO" by ITZY.

381
00:19:26,193 --> 00:19:32,233
(Performance Unit mission song: "LOCO" by ITZY)

382
00:19:32,733 --> 00:19:37,233
(It's a song with addictive and powerful dance moves.)

383
00:19:37,233 --> 00:19:40,973
(GALACTIKA arranged "LOCO" for a powerful performance.)

384
00:19:42,502 --> 00:19:44,772
I think it's a cool song.

385
00:19:44,812 --> 00:19:46,842
It is very thrilling.

386
00:19:47,213 --> 00:19:51,953
(What will "LOCO" be like performed by Performance Unit?)

387
00:19:52,953 --> 00:19:55,282
Let's say the Vocal Unit performs.

388
00:19:55,352 --> 00:19:58,193
Should we pick someone who sings well...

389
00:19:58,193 --> 00:20:00,863
or someone who stands out?

390
00:20:00,863 --> 00:20:03,832
- That's the problem. - It must be hard.

391
00:20:03,832 --> 00:20:05,963
- That's always been our concern. - Yes.

392
00:20:05,963 --> 00:20:09,032
I think we have to focus on their positions today.

393
00:20:10,133 --> 00:20:11,433
Good.

394
00:20:11,703 --> 00:20:15,542
If they get a ticket here, their debut is almost guaranteed.

395
00:20:15,542 --> 00:20:17,072
- I think so. - I got goosebumps.

396
00:20:17,943 --> 00:20:19,812
I'm really nervous.

397
00:20:19,812 --> 00:20:21,782
(Who will win the promotion in the Position Units?)

398
00:20:21,782 --> 00:20:23,012
I'm excited.

399
00:20:24,883 --> 00:20:27,153
We will start with the Visual Unit.

400
00:20:27,282 --> 00:20:28,852
- Hello. - Hello.

401
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:33,292
(The first Unit Station, Visual Unit)

402
00:20:33,292 --> 00:20:36,193
Look at their outfits. It's crazy.

403
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:38,133
- Hello. - Hello.

404
00:20:38,133 --> 00:20:40,233
(Producer PAPERMAKER: Samuel Ku, EB, TENZO)

405
00:20:40,233 --> 00:20:41,562
- Hello. - Hello.

406
00:20:41,602 --> 00:20:43,002
They are like eight dolls.

407
00:20:43,002 --> 00:20:44,102
They're so pretty.

408
00:20:44,602 --> 00:20:46,433
Kotoko looks like a real-life version...

409
00:20:46,433 --> 00:20:47,703
- She's cute. - of a Barbie doll.

410
00:20:47,703 --> 00:20:48,973
My goodness.

411
00:20:48,973 --> 00:20:50,413
- They're pretty. - Dressed in matching colors.

412
00:20:51,342 --> 00:20:54,213
- Visual Unit, introduce yourselves. - Okay.

413
00:20:54,312 --> 00:20:55,383
Two, three.

414
00:20:55,413 --> 00:20:56,683
- Hello. - Hello.

415
00:20:56,683 --> 00:20:58,852
- We are Visual Unit... - We are Visual Unit...

416
00:20:58,852 --> 00:21:02,252
- that will bewitch you... - that will bewitch you...

417
00:21:02,252 --> 00:21:04,252
- with our performance. - with our performance.

418
00:21:04,252 --> 00:21:06,653
(We are Visual Unit.)

419
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:10,363
- Bewitch us? - They're pretty.

420
00:21:10,592 --> 00:21:12,233
- Nana. - Yes.

421
00:21:12,292 --> 00:21:14,203
You've always shown powerful performances before.

422
00:21:14,203 --> 00:21:17,502
And you're trying something opposite for the first time.

423
00:21:17,502 --> 00:21:18,633
How are you feeling?

424
00:21:19,102 --> 00:21:21,272
This is my first time...

425
00:21:21,842 --> 00:21:25,473
performing a song with a cute concept.

426
00:21:25,473 --> 00:21:27,742
So I was a little nervous.

427
00:21:28,213 --> 00:21:34,453
But to show off my new charms that are different from what I've done,

428
00:21:34,453 --> 00:21:39,092
I've worked on my facial expressions and cute moves for this song.

429
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:40,592
Please look forward to it.

430
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:43,163
- All right. - We look forward to it.

431
00:21:43,893 --> 00:21:46,693
If Nana gets a ticket here,

432
00:21:46,762 --> 00:21:48,262
- Nana will make her debut. - She will debut.

433
00:21:51,733 --> 00:21:54,143
I'd like to ask the producers.

434
00:21:54,143 --> 00:21:57,373
What made you choose "Catallena" for Visual Unit?

435
00:21:58,812 --> 00:22:01,082
We can't talk about idol artists...

436
00:22:01,082 --> 00:22:03,552
without mentioning their talents.

437
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:05,953
I don't think Visual Unit...

438
00:22:05,953 --> 00:22:07,782
just needs to look pretty.

439
00:22:07,923 --> 00:22:11,893
I wanted to see how they manage to make their looks more memorable.

440
00:22:12,022 --> 00:22:14,092
And I thought "Catallena" was the song...

441
00:22:14,092 --> 00:22:16,363
that they could show off their talents with.

442
00:22:16,363 --> 00:22:18,193
That's why we chose that song.

443
00:22:19,092 --> 00:22:21,332
(What will "Catallena" by Visual Unit be like?)

444
00:22:21,832 --> 00:22:25,373
We are Visual Unit, you know.

445
00:22:26,173 --> 00:22:30,002
They are all cute and lovely.

446
00:22:30,072 --> 00:22:32,012
I think they make up the Visual Unit because they're pretty.

447
00:22:32,512 --> 00:22:35,512
This is something new. I think it will be fun.

448
00:22:36,883 --> 00:22:38,983
(Visual Unit checks their parts.)

449
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:40,282
- Thank you. - Sure.

450
00:22:41,153 --> 00:22:43,423
(Kotoko looks long-faced.)

451
00:22:43,423 --> 00:22:45,123
I got to sing many parts,

452
00:22:45,352 --> 00:22:49,022
but I didn't get to sing the parts I wanted.

453
00:22:49,022 --> 00:22:52,532
So I feel complicated.

454
00:22:53,832 --> 00:22:56,633
I got to sing many parts.

455
00:22:56,863 --> 00:22:59,032
I got to sing the starting part...

456
00:22:59,233 --> 00:23:01,542
and the ending part.

457
00:23:01,542 --> 00:23:04,413
(The starting and ending parts are the highlight.)

458
00:23:04,413 --> 00:23:05,413
And...

459
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:08,143
I also got to sing the part where I say, "Oh, my,"

460
00:23:08,143 --> 00:23:10,483
which I wanted. So...

461
00:23:10,483 --> 00:23:11,613
(Nana got to sing the part she wanted.)

462
00:23:11,713 --> 00:23:13,983
I'm really glad,

463
00:23:14,123 --> 00:23:16,953
but I'm afraid the other members would...

464
00:23:17,022 --> 00:23:20,123
take it away from me.

465
00:23:20,223 --> 00:23:25,693
I think I should practice hard so I can do better.

466
00:23:26,092 --> 00:23:31,532
And I'll practice hard for the part where I say, "Ha!"

467
00:23:31,832 --> 00:23:33,973
I want to do the last one.

468
00:23:37,012 --> 00:23:38,143
Bye.

469
00:23:39,173 --> 00:23:41,012
Goodbye.

470
00:23:42,413 --> 00:23:45,082
Those who want this part, please stand up.

471
00:23:45,153 --> 00:23:46,213
Yes.

472
00:23:47,423 --> 00:23:48,683
You all want it.

473
00:23:48,683 --> 00:23:49,923
(Kotoko got up right away without hesitating.)

474
00:23:49,923 --> 00:23:52,723
Okay. I'd like you to try it with confidence.

475
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:53,792
- Yes. - Yes.

476
00:23:59,363 --> 00:24:04,733
I really want to do the part where I say "Ha!"

477
00:24:04,733 --> 00:24:08,802
But I don't know how to practice it.

478
00:24:09,143 --> 00:24:12,742
I thought I should do really well during the recording.

479
00:24:13,782 --> 00:24:19,883
(A fierce competition to get the highlight)

480
00:24:24,052 --> 00:24:28,663
(Kotoko practices the "Ha" part.)

481
00:24:32,633 --> 00:24:37,502
(Nana tries the same.)

482
00:24:38,332 --> 00:24:40,643
This is too difficult.

483
00:24:41,342 --> 00:24:44,042
(Which one of them will get the "Ha" part?)

484
00:24:44,143 --> 00:24:46,613
(The recording of "Catallena")

485
00:24:47,613 --> 00:24:50,812
(Kotoko sings with confidence.)

486
00:24:51,683 --> 00:24:53,852
- You do sound exciting. - Right.

487
00:24:53,852 --> 00:24:56,183
- It's exciting. - You're a good fit for this song.

488
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:57,893
- Try a few more times. - Okay.

489
00:24:58,223 --> 00:25:00,792
Chic and proud Catallena

490
00:25:00,792 --> 00:25:02,163
I like this part.

491
00:25:02,193 --> 00:25:04,133
- It's really good. - It just sounds right.

492
00:25:04,133 --> 00:25:05,733
- The nuance is right. - I'm falling for you

493
00:25:07,032 --> 00:25:08,633
- Let's try the "Ha" part. - Okay.

494
00:25:09,403 --> 00:25:13,772
(She sings the part in question.)

495
00:25:14,373 --> 00:25:17,542
(PAPERMAKER seems satisfied again.)

496
00:25:17,542 --> 00:25:18,613
She's good.

497
00:25:18,842 --> 00:25:20,012
There you go.

498
00:25:20,512 --> 00:25:22,883
- Kotoko, let's try this part. - Okay.

499
00:25:23,983 --> 00:25:27,883
My peculiar Catallena

500
00:25:28,723 --> 00:25:30,653
"Peculiar."

501
00:25:30,752 --> 00:25:32,052
Peculiar

502
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:34,092
- Enunciate. Peculiar. - Peculiar.

503
00:25:34,092 --> 00:25:35,322
Yes. That's it.

504
00:25:35,322 --> 00:25:38,463
(She's flustered by the word that's difficult to pronounce.)

505
00:25:38,463 --> 00:25:39,863
- Try it again. - Okay.

506
00:25:39,863 --> 00:25:40,963
All right.

507
00:25:41,703 --> 00:25:45,473
My peculiar Catallena

508
00:25:46,532 --> 00:25:47,903
It's "peculiar."

509
00:25:48,072 --> 00:25:50,572
- Peculiar. - Peculiar.

510
00:25:50,973 --> 00:25:55,242
(She finds it hard to pronounce the word.)

511
00:25:55,242 --> 00:25:56,342
That's enough.

512
00:25:56,342 --> 00:25:58,012
Kotoko, you're done.

513
00:25:58,012 --> 00:25:59,713
- Thank you. - Thank you.

514
00:26:00,453 --> 00:26:02,822
(Next up is Nana.)

515
00:26:03,022 --> 00:26:06,953
My peculiar Catallena

516
00:26:07,562 --> 00:26:09,363
- She has good pronunciation. - Let's save it.

517
00:26:09,363 --> 00:26:10,393
I'll save it.

518
00:26:10,393 --> 00:26:11,762
- Let's continue. - Okay.

519
00:26:12,363 --> 00:26:15,602
Oh my, she's so great I've fallen for her

520
00:26:16,203 --> 00:26:20,203
(Nana sings more confidently after the compliment.)

521
00:26:20,272 --> 00:26:21,643
She screams.

522
00:26:21,673 --> 00:26:22,842
That's it.

523
00:26:22,842 --> 00:26:24,443
You may come out, Nana.

524
00:26:24,443 --> 00:26:26,042
- Okay. Thank you. - Thank you.

525
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:27,113
Thank you.

526
00:26:27,143 --> 00:26:28,183
She's really good.

527
00:26:28,812 --> 00:26:30,653
Let's start from the part, "I've fallen for her."

528
00:26:30,653 --> 00:26:31,953
- Okay. - The highlight.

529
00:26:32,552 --> 00:26:35,582
I don’t like her because she’s so chic

530
00:26:35,582 --> 00:26:40,022
But even as a girl, I can see she's so attractive

531
00:26:40,522 --> 00:26:42,562
- She's good. - You deserve many parts.

532
00:26:42,562 --> 00:26:43,592
I know. She's good.

533
00:26:43,663 --> 00:26:45,933
She's peculiar

534
00:26:45,933 --> 00:26:48,963
But I want to see her I want to know her

535
00:26:50,203 --> 00:26:53,272
(Sumin continues the momentum and tries singing many parts.)

536
00:26:53,302 --> 00:26:55,572
- This sounds like your song, Sumin. - She's good.

537
00:26:55,602 --> 00:26:57,572
- You're really good. - She's amazing.

538
00:26:57,572 --> 00:26:59,443
- I'll save this one. - Okay.

539
00:26:59,443 --> 00:27:00,542
(They shower her with praise.)

540
00:27:00,943 --> 00:27:03,012
I was a little nervous.

541
00:27:03,883 --> 00:27:06,383
I became a little insecure.

542
00:27:07,522 --> 00:27:10,123
After the recording, I don't think...

543
00:27:10,153 --> 00:27:12,322
you all will get the same amount of parts.

544
00:27:12,423 --> 00:27:15,822
We have to care about the quality of your performance.

545
00:27:15,822 --> 00:27:19,262
Since Sumin and Nana did...

546
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:20,903
very well today,

547
00:27:20,963 --> 00:27:22,602
they will get more parts.

548
00:27:22,602 --> 00:27:25,633
And Kotoko created a good atmosphere for the song.

549
00:27:26,233 --> 00:27:29,703
So there will be some changes.

550
00:27:29,703 --> 00:27:32,443
- Okay. - That's what you should know.

551
00:27:32,443 --> 00:27:34,113
(Who will be the winner of the fierce competition?)

552
00:27:34,113 --> 00:27:37,512
- Hello. - Hello.

553
00:27:38,183 --> 00:27:40,752
Are the seats assigned according to our positions?

554
00:27:41,483 --> 00:27:42,923
These are for Performance Unit, these are for Visual Unit,

555
00:27:42,923 --> 00:27:44,393
and these are for Vocal Unit.

556
00:27:44,393 --> 00:27:46,592
- Are we divided like that? - Is that it?

557
00:27:47,693 --> 00:27:48,693
What?

558
00:27:48,693 --> 00:27:49,693
What's going on?

559
00:27:49,693 --> 00:27:53,633
(Half nervous and half curious)

560
00:27:54,002 --> 00:27:57,772
Today, we will see how well you're prepared...

561
00:27:57,933 --> 00:28:00,502
for your Position Unit performances.

562
00:28:01,302 --> 00:28:05,012
This is the day of the interim evaluation.

563
00:28:05,012 --> 00:28:06,072
I knew it.

564
00:28:06,072 --> 00:28:07,113
(My goodness)

565
00:28:07,113 --> 00:28:08,242
An interim evaluation?

566
00:28:08,713 --> 00:28:09,782
My goodness.

567
00:28:10,883 --> 00:28:15,923
(Interim Evaluation Rule: Each unit will show their performances...)

568
00:28:15,923 --> 00:28:21,723
(and the participants will take a vote on their performances.)

569
00:28:21,723 --> 00:28:26,032
You will be evaluating your performances yourselves.

570
00:28:26,233 --> 00:28:30,633
(What will be the results of the interim evaluation?)

571
00:28:30,633 --> 00:28:31,832
- Good luck. - You got this.

572
00:28:31,832 --> 00:28:33,572
- I'm curious. - You can do this.

573
00:28:33,703 --> 00:28:38,312
Our performance is supposed to be cheerful and exciting.

574
00:28:38,312 --> 00:28:41,282
And during the dance break,

575
00:28:41,413 --> 00:28:44,052
Nana will show off her sexy charms.

576
00:28:45,683 --> 00:28:47,522
I'm so excited.

577
00:28:47,822 --> 00:28:49,782
- Nana with sexy moves? - I can't imagine it.

578
00:28:49,782 --> 00:28:51,223
Good luck! I'm so excited.

579
00:28:51,322 --> 00:28:52,852
Who do you think will be doing this?

580
00:28:52,852 --> 00:28:53,963
(Expectations are getting higher.)

581
00:28:53,963 --> 00:28:55,193
Let's go.

582
00:28:55,193 --> 00:28:56,423
Good luck!

583
00:28:56,423 --> 00:28:58,363
- You got this. - Let's go.

584
00:28:58,363 --> 00:29:00,062
I'm so excited and curious.

585
00:29:03,363 --> 00:29:06,002
(Nana starts singing the first part confidently.)

586
00:29:13,572 --> 00:29:16,413
(Dancing in perfect unison)

587
00:29:17,082 --> 00:29:19,453
(The dance break continues.)

588
00:29:19,453 --> 00:29:20,483
Red sun.

589
00:29:23,552 --> 00:29:24,623
They're in unison.

590
00:29:24,623 --> 00:29:25,792
(The highlight continues.)

591
00:29:26,592 --> 00:29:27,792
(Gabi for the first "Ha" part)

592
00:29:28,492 --> 00:29:29,792
(Oh Yoona for the second "Ha" part)

593
00:29:30,123 --> 00:29:32,492
(Who gets to do the last one?)

594
00:29:35,302 --> 00:29:36,302
(Ha!)

595
00:29:38,403 --> 00:29:41,802
(Kotoko is the one with the last "Ha" part.)

596
00:29:41,802 --> 00:29:43,403
This is crazy.

597
00:29:47,983 --> 00:29:49,012
They're so lovely.

598
00:29:49,643 --> 00:29:51,113
- Great. - That was amazing.

599
00:29:52,012 --> 00:29:53,913
Kotoko was amazing, wasn't she?

600
00:29:54,852 --> 00:29:57,022
- Totally. - It was amazing.

601
00:29:57,552 --> 00:29:59,723
I didn't know she had such a loud voice.

602
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:02,792
(What's the result of the interim evaluation for Visual Unit?)

603
00:30:02,792 --> 00:30:04,963
- I'm really nervous. - Me too.

604
00:30:05,292 --> 00:30:07,233
- Nana, open it. - I'm so nervous.

605
00:30:07,363 --> 00:30:10,403
(It's time to reveal the result.)

606
00:30:10,403 --> 00:30:11,433
I'm scared.

607
00:30:11,703 --> 00:30:13,903
One, two, three.

608
00:30:17,203 --> 00:30:18,272
My goodness.

609
00:30:18,913 --> 00:30:20,213
Unbelievable.

610
00:30:20,782 --> 00:30:21,943
(Gabi, Kwon Eunhyung, Kim Sumin, Nana, Oh Yoona)

611
00:30:21,943 --> 00:30:24,483
This is amazing. You got everything.

612
00:30:24,483 --> 00:30:25,812
- Right. - Unbelievable.

613
00:30:25,812 --> 00:30:26,953
Is this it?

614
00:30:26,953 --> 00:30:28,352
(Yona, Jang Sua, Kotoko, Heo Sunbin, Hwang Sieun)

615
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:29,582
It's all similar.

616
00:30:30,082 --> 00:30:31,322
The difference with Nana is only one vote.

617
00:30:31,322 --> 00:30:32,352
- Nana and... - Right.

618
00:30:32,352 --> 00:30:34,223
Kotoko got nine votes.

619
00:30:34,223 --> 00:30:35,592
(8 votes, 9 votes)

620
00:30:35,592 --> 00:30:41,302
Kotoko got the most votes for the contestant...

621
00:30:41,302 --> 00:30:45,072
that is likely to be promoted.

622
00:30:45,072 --> 00:30:48,973
Kotoko gets to do the last "Ha" part.

623
00:30:49,373 --> 00:30:50,403
So...

624
00:30:51,473 --> 00:30:52,742
I think that's why she stands out.

625
00:30:53,943 --> 00:30:55,842
I got the most votes.

626
00:30:56,213 --> 00:30:57,582
I thought Nana was...

627
00:30:58,582 --> 00:30:59,953
my rival.

628
00:31:00,453 --> 00:31:08,092
But I think I'm better when it comes to facial expressions.

629
00:31:08,363 --> 00:31:12,032
I'll show you my charms I haven't shown before...

630
00:31:12,233 --> 00:31:13,832
so I can win a promotion.

631
00:31:16,863 --> 00:31:20,203
(One day with only a few days left until the competition)

632
00:31:26,312 --> 00:31:28,312
(Visual Unit is invited to someplace.)

633
00:31:28,312 --> 00:31:29,383
This is pretty.

634
00:31:29,383 --> 00:31:30,613
- My gosh. - This is amazing.

635
00:31:30,852 --> 00:31:32,183
I'm so excited.

636
00:31:32,413 --> 00:31:33,782
- My gosh. - This is so pretty.

637
00:31:34,383 --> 00:31:37,552
- Hello, everyone. - My gosh.

638
00:31:37,552 --> 00:31:38,552
(Surprised)

639
00:31:38,552 --> 00:31:40,322
I'm RISABAE, the beauty creator...

640
00:31:40,322 --> 00:31:42,492
who invited you all here.

641
00:31:42,492 --> 00:31:44,062
Nice to meet you.

642
00:31:44,693 --> 00:31:46,663
I'll show you the makeup of IU...

643
00:31:46,663 --> 00:31:48,163
from her music video of "Palette."

644
00:31:48,663 --> 00:31:50,002
(The golden hand in the beauty world with 2.25 million subscribers)

645
00:31:50,002 --> 00:31:51,373
I'll add shade.

646
00:31:51,802 --> 00:31:53,433
(The master of girl group cover makeup)

647
00:31:53,633 --> 00:31:56,072
(The recognized leader of K-beauty)

648
00:31:56,473 --> 00:32:00,213
I'll give you some good tips on K-pop idol makeup.

649
00:32:00,473 --> 00:32:02,383
I'll show you.

650
00:32:04,512 --> 00:32:08,052
Does anyone want a makeover with me?

651
00:32:08,383 --> 00:32:10,552
- Me. - Then shall we have Sieun do it?

652
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:15,893
I'm going to use this cushion today.

653
00:32:16,092 --> 00:32:19,292
This is for stage makeup, you see.

654
00:32:19,663 --> 00:32:21,802
So it's important to put it on lightly...

655
00:32:21,802 --> 00:32:24,302
while covering up the skin.

656
00:32:24,502 --> 00:32:26,933
And it's also important to make it last long.

657
00:32:26,933 --> 00:32:27,943
- Yes. - Yes.

658
00:32:31,713 --> 00:32:33,012
- Look at the color. - I can't believe it.

659
00:32:34,383 --> 00:32:36,213
- It looks so moist. - It's pretty.

660
00:32:36,613 --> 00:32:38,812
(It sticks to the skin naturally.)

661
00:32:38,812 --> 00:32:40,923
- It looks great. - Amazing.

662
00:32:41,983 --> 00:32:44,082
It looks natural and bright.

663
00:32:44,082 --> 00:32:46,193
It doesn't look thick at all.

664
00:32:46,193 --> 00:32:48,193
- Right. - And it covers up the skin well.

665
00:32:48,193 --> 00:32:49,992
- It looks like her real skin. - Exactly.

666
00:32:49,992 --> 00:32:53,393
It looks like she has glowing skin.

667
00:32:53,393 --> 00:32:56,403
- Right. - It has a soft glow, right?

668
00:32:56,403 --> 00:32:58,433
- Yes. - And it doesn't irritate the skin.

669
00:32:58,433 --> 00:33:00,173
It doesn't?

670
00:33:00,532 --> 00:33:01,873
It's important to make...

671
00:33:01,873 --> 00:33:03,842
- your stage makeup last long. - Yes.

672
00:33:03,842 --> 00:33:05,913
I'll use a powder product...

673
00:33:05,913 --> 00:33:07,812
that will keep your skin soft and smooth.

674
00:33:07,812 --> 00:33:09,282
- It's soft. - That's what I need.

675
00:33:09,913 --> 00:33:11,782
Apply it on your nose here.

676
00:33:12,582 --> 00:33:14,983
This part will still glow this way.

677
00:33:14,983 --> 00:33:16,953
It will make your nose look higher.

678
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:19,123
(She gives good tips for Visual Unit.)

679
00:33:19,123 --> 00:33:20,992
The pink color is perfect for the song, "Catallena."

680
00:33:21,393 --> 00:33:22,423
Right.

681
00:33:28,562 --> 00:33:30,262
(She's so pretty.)

682
00:33:30,262 --> 00:33:31,272
Amazing.

683
00:33:33,072 --> 00:33:34,772
- Look in the mirror. - I look like Catallena.

684
00:33:34,772 --> 00:33:36,042
Catallena?

685
00:33:36,042 --> 00:33:37,913
- I love it. - You love it?

686
00:33:37,913 --> 00:33:39,072
I want it too.

687
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:41,012
You should perform on stage right away.

688
00:33:41,012 --> 00:33:42,582
(What will Visual Unit's performance be like with the new looks?)

689
00:33:42,582 --> 00:33:44,252
I'm very excited.

690
00:33:44,252 --> 00:33:47,052
Visual Unit, show us your performance.

691
00:33:47,153 --> 00:33:48,183
- Okay. - Okay.

692
00:33:49,223 --> 00:33:51,193
- Good luck. - Good luck.

693
00:33:51,193 --> 00:33:52,423
Do well.

694
00:33:52,423 --> 00:33:53,522
They're so lovely.

695
00:33:54,363 --> 00:33:55,663
I'm curious.

696
00:33:57,492 --> 00:33:58,762
My goodness.

697
00:33:58,762 --> 00:34:00,532
- I'm excited. - Catallena.

698
00:34:01,203 --> 00:34:02,302
I'm nervous.

699
00:34:21,182 --> 00:34:23,452
("Catallena" by Gabi, Kwon Eunhyung,)

700
00:34:23,452 --> 00:34:25,752
(Nana, Oh Yoona, Kotoko, and Hwang Sieun)

701
00:34:31,832 --> 00:34:32,863
There she is.

702
00:35:06,332 --> 00:35:07,363
They're so lovely.

703
00:35:15,702 --> 00:35:16,743
So cute.

704
00:36:18,903 --> 00:36:19,972
She's so cute.

705
00:36:49,502 --> 00:36:50,662
How lovely.

706
00:37:23,102 --> 00:37:24,772
- They mellowed my heart. - I know.

707
00:37:25,832 --> 00:37:27,733
- Nana was amazing. - They're so lovely.

708
00:37:28,243 --> 00:37:30,502
- Kotoko is so cute. - They sing so well.

709
00:37:30,903 --> 00:37:33,243
- It was lovely. - It was great.

710
00:37:33,443 --> 00:37:35,513
- Thank you. - Thank you.

711
00:37:41,153 --> 00:37:42,553
Kotoko was amazing.

712
00:37:42,553 --> 00:37:44,022
She captivated me.

713
00:37:44,252 --> 00:37:45,522
They killed it.

714
00:37:47,722 --> 00:37:49,162
No words are needed.

715
00:37:49,162 --> 00:37:53,463
You know that ice cream with strawberry flavor, chocolate flavor,

716
00:37:53,463 --> 00:37:54,932
The three flavored ice cream?

717
00:37:54,932 --> 00:37:57,403
and vanilla flavor at a restaurant?

718
00:37:57,403 --> 00:38:00,133
It's as if I finished off a big feast...

719
00:38:00,133 --> 00:38:02,803
with a good dessert,

720
00:38:02,903 --> 00:38:05,673
your performance was very refreshing.

721
00:38:05,673 --> 00:38:07,513
Visually speaking,

722
00:38:07,513 --> 00:38:11,182
all I thought was it couldn't get any better.

723
00:38:11,182 --> 00:38:14,082
Every single expression was on point.

724
00:38:14,182 --> 00:38:16,452
I could tell how much effort you put in,

725
00:38:16,452 --> 00:38:18,952
which I wanted to mention.

726
00:38:18,952 --> 00:38:20,292
Great work.

727
00:38:20,292 --> 00:38:22,423
- Thank you. - Thank you.

728
00:38:23,993 --> 00:38:27,033
There were members I thought...

729
00:38:27,033 --> 00:38:29,202
would naturally look good together...

730
00:38:29,303 --> 00:38:32,102
and members who surprised me.

731
00:38:32,102 --> 00:38:33,432
Sumin.

732
00:38:33,832 --> 00:38:36,102
- Thank you. - Really.

733
00:38:36,573 --> 00:38:39,243
- My head kept turning towards you. - I see.

734
00:38:39,243 --> 00:38:42,243
Unconsciously, I became addicted to you, one with you,

735
00:38:42,243 --> 00:38:43,542
and bewitched by you.

736
00:38:43,542 --> 00:38:45,452
Thank you.

737
00:38:45,852 --> 00:38:47,452
- I agree. - Me too.

738
00:38:47,613 --> 00:38:51,593
I got hooked on Kotoko's part.

739
00:38:51,722 --> 00:38:54,792
"To my very bones" was the lyrics.

740
00:38:55,562 --> 00:38:58,033
(To my very bones)

741
00:38:58,733 --> 00:39:01,093
I really wanted to adore her...

742
00:39:01,233 --> 00:39:03,263
to my very bones.

743
00:39:04,062 --> 00:39:05,702
You're talented.

744
00:39:05,702 --> 00:39:07,403
And you know that, right, Kotoko?

745
00:39:07,602 --> 00:39:09,243
- Yes. - You're gifted, right?

746
00:39:09,243 --> 00:39:10,272
Yes.

747
00:39:10,903 --> 00:39:11,972
How cute.

748
00:39:12,443 --> 00:39:13,772
She's seriously cute.

749
00:39:14,243 --> 00:39:16,812
- And Eunhyung. - What is it?

750
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:18,582
I have high expectations...

751
00:39:18,582 --> 00:39:20,383
- for you. - I see.

752
00:39:20,383 --> 00:39:23,122
You have that voice and character...

753
00:39:23,122 --> 00:39:26,693
- that I personally like. - Yes.

754
00:39:26,693 --> 00:39:28,423
But honestly,

755
00:39:28,423 --> 00:39:30,963
it felt like you gave up on this performance.

756
00:39:30,963 --> 00:39:32,463
"This doesn't suit me."

757
00:39:32,733 --> 00:39:34,562
- But I didn't. - It was like,

758
00:39:34,562 --> 00:39:36,062
"I will do my best,"

759
00:39:36,062 --> 00:39:37,432
"but I wonder why I'm doing this."

760
00:39:37,432 --> 00:39:40,202
You gave off those feelings throughout the performance.

761
00:39:41,972 --> 00:39:43,803
I hate to compare you two.

762
00:39:43,803 --> 00:39:45,372
But Sumin...

763
00:39:45,372 --> 00:39:48,642
didn't show off what she was born with.

764
00:39:48,642 --> 00:39:51,352
She understood the concept of this performance perfectly...

765
00:39:51,352 --> 00:39:55,053
and knew what kind of role she should take on in this song.

766
00:39:55,053 --> 00:39:56,823
It was clear during the performance.

767
00:39:56,823 --> 00:39:59,292
- Thank you. - You can do that, too, Eunhyung.

768
00:39:59,292 --> 00:40:00,792
You're capable of doing it.

769
00:40:00,792 --> 00:40:04,863
But it was as if you kept on shutting yourself off from it...

770
00:40:04,863 --> 00:40:06,363
throughout the performance.

771
00:40:06,733 --> 00:40:10,233
That only caused us to be drawn to the other members.

772
00:40:10,233 --> 00:40:12,173
- I see. - That part was regrettable.

773
00:40:12,173 --> 00:40:14,573
I hope you will improve on it.

774
00:40:14,573 --> 00:40:16,173
- Okay. Thank you. - Great.

775
00:40:18,972 --> 00:40:20,912
What did you think, producers?

776
00:40:21,443 --> 00:40:25,412
There were a few members who stood out more than the others.

777
00:40:25,412 --> 00:40:27,852
First off, Nana.

778
00:40:27,852 --> 00:40:29,483
It was the same in the last mission.

779
00:40:29,483 --> 00:40:32,423
When she opened the song "Girls On Top,"

780
00:40:34,823 --> 00:40:37,022
I knew they would kill it.

781
00:40:37,222 --> 00:40:38,662
And today, as well,

782
00:40:38,792 --> 00:40:41,803
when Nana started the first verse,

783
00:40:46,733 --> 00:40:48,702
I knew they were going to kill it again.

784
00:40:48,702 --> 00:40:52,772
Nana was reliable, like a distinct opening member.

785
00:40:52,772 --> 00:40:54,883
- Thank you. - And another member...

786
00:40:54,883 --> 00:40:56,312
was the charming Kotoko.

787
00:40:58,053 --> 00:41:00,582
I experienced what you all did too.

788
00:41:00,582 --> 00:41:03,053
Just looking at Kotoko standing on stage...

789
00:41:03,053 --> 00:41:05,452
makes me smile uncontrollably.

790
00:41:05,452 --> 00:41:08,963
If I had to pick one best second in today's "Catallena" performance,

791
00:41:08,963 --> 00:41:11,792
it would be when Kotoko jumped.

792
00:41:14,562 --> 00:41:16,162
She jumped really high.

793
00:41:16,162 --> 00:41:18,102
That moment was impressive.

794
00:41:18,102 --> 00:41:21,133
So, I wanted to express how memorable Kotoko was.

795
00:41:21,133 --> 00:41:22,303
Thank you.

796
00:41:25,312 --> 00:41:27,812
I can't guess who it will be.

797
00:41:28,082 --> 00:41:30,182
Now then, who will we promote today?

798
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:34,383
- It's either Nana or Kotoko for me. - Really?

799
00:41:34,722 --> 00:41:37,222
When it comes to Nana and Kotoko,

800
00:41:37,222 --> 00:41:38,892
they were born with it.

801
00:41:38,892 --> 00:41:40,752
"It suits them perfectly."

802
00:41:40,752 --> 00:41:42,963
"They're good at it," was what went through my head.

803
00:41:42,963 --> 00:41:44,493
But as for Sumin,

804
00:41:45,263 --> 00:41:48,403
she made me realize she could show off her charm today.

805
00:41:48,832 --> 00:41:51,832
So, to me, Sumin's performance came as a surprise.

806
00:41:51,832 --> 00:41:53,432
I was mesmerized the whole time.

807
00:41:53,432 --> 00:41:54,633
I racked my brains.

808
00:41:54,633 --> 00:41:57,803
Just imagine the amount of effort they must've put in...

809
00:41:57,803 --> 00:42:00,113
to stand out as much as Kotoko.

810
00:42:00,272 --> 00:42:03,343
Kotoko was born to become an idol.

811
00:42:03,682 --> 00:42:05,082
You're right.

812
00:42:05,082 --> 00:42:06,783
Nobody can beat that.

813
00:42:06,783 --> 00:42:08,952
- Choosing one member is too hard. - Right?

814
00:42:09,182 --> 00:42:11,352
Think about it for 1 minute. No, 30 seconds.

815
00:42:11,352 --> 00:42:13,852
This isn't easy at all.

816
00:42:16,263 --> 00:42:18,863
(Announcing the Visual Unit's promotion result)

817
00:42:18,863 --> 00:42:20,062
The result will be announced.

818
00:42:21,062 --> 00:42:22,432
Who will it be?

819
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:25,303
I'm curious about this unit the most.

820
00:42:27,573 --> 00:42:29,702
We will announce the one member...

821
00:42:29,702 --> 00:42:33,173
from the Visual Unit who will be promoted with Unicorn Ticketing.

822
00:42:35,983 --> 00:42:39,613
Two members will be called. Please step forward.

823
00:42:39,613 --> 00:42:42,752
(2 names will be called as promotion candidates.)

824
00:42:43,122 --> 00:42:44,323
Kim Sumin.

825
00:42:45,193 --> 00:42:48,522
(The 1st promotion candidate, Kim Sumin)

826
00:42:49,593 --> 00:42:53,263
(Who is the 2nd promotion candidate?)

827
00:42:53,493 --> 00:42:54,633
Kotoko.

828
00:42:55,903 --> 00:43:00,903
(The 2nd promotion candidate, Kotoko)

829
00:43:03,502 --> 00:43:06,073
It was a huge dilemma...

830
00:43:06,372 --> 00:43:08,783
for us Unicorns.

831
00:43:09,243 --> 00:43:11,682
Sticking to the theme of this Unit Station,

832
00:43:12,252 --> 00:43:14,412
do we choose the member who was visually outstanding...

833
00:43:14,412 --> 00:43:16,783
and killed the performance...

834
00:43:16,783 --> 00:43:18,553
with her charms?

835
00:43:19,153 --> 00:43:21,292
Or do we take a different approach...

836
00:43:21,823 --> 00:43:24,763
and choose the member who improved step by step...

837
00:43:24,763 --> 00:43:27,662
from the basics and showed us a different side of her?

838
00:43:29,033 --> 00:43:30,133
Who will it be?

839
00:43:30,363 --> 00:43:31,872
Both did a great job.

840
00:43:32,803 --> 00:43:34,633
The member promoted in the Visual Unit is...

841
00:43:43,713 --> 00:43:45,113
Kotoko.

842
00:43:46,013 --> 00:43:47,952
(In Visual Unit, Kotoko wins the promotion.)

843
00:43:47,952 --> 00:43:49,252
Congratulations.

844
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:52,093
- Thank you. - Congratulations, Kotoko.

845
00:43:52,622 --> 00:43:55,463
Kotoko has been promoted to Level I.

846
00:43:55,463 --> 00:43:56,693
Congratulations.

847
00:43:57,323 --> 00:43:58,832
Thank you.

848
00:43:59,633 --> 00:44:01,233
Great job, everyone.

849
00:44:01,233 --> 00:44:02,733
- Thank you. - Thank you.

850
00:44:02,733 --> 00:44:04,162
You worked hard.

851
00:44:04,162 --> 00:44:05,472
Great work.

852
00:44:07,932 --> 00:44:09,502
But really,

853
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:12,343
I feel really proud of Kotoko for improving continuously.

854
00:44:12,343 --> 00:44:14,142
- I know, right? - Totally.

855
00:44:15,542 --> 00:44:17,013
Now then.

856
00:44:17,812 --> 00:44:20,013
Vocal Unit, come on to the stage.

857
00:44:23,852 --> 00:44:25,053
- Gosh. - Oh, no.

858
00:44:25,053 --> 00:44:27,522
- They must be nervous. - I was dying to see their stage.

859
00:44:27,522 --> 00:44:28,823
Their hearts must be pounding.

860
00:44:30,363 --> 00:44:31,633
(The 2nd Unit Station: Vocal Unit)

861
00:44:31,633 --> 00:44:34,133
- Hello. - Hello.

862
00:44:34,133 --> 00:44:36,932
- Hi. - Hi.

863
00:44:36,932 --> 00:44:39,872
- Hi. - Gosh, they look like angels.

864
00:44:39,872 --> 00:44:41,073
How pretty.

865
00:44:44,042 --> 00:44:47,312
Universe Ticket's main vocalists are all here.

866
00:44:47,312 --> 00:44:49,042
Please introduce your unit.

867
00:44:49,182 --> 00:44:51,343
Okay. Two, three.

868
00:44:51,682 --> 00:44:54,013
- Hi. We are... - Hi. We are...

869
00:44:54,312 --> 00:44:57,952
- the beautiful... - the beautiful...

870
00:44:57,952 --> 00:45:01,593
- the beautiful Vocal Unit. - the beautiful Vocal Unit.

871
00:45:03,062 --> 00:45:04,062
That was cute.

872
00:45:04,363 --> 00:45:05,363
They look like princesses.

873
00:45:05,363 --> 00:45:06,792
Gehlee's legs look pretty today, as well.

874
00:45:06,792 --> 00:45:08,602
I like it. I like her pose.

875
00:45:08,602 --> 00:45:11,202
(Gehlee's signature pose)

876
00:45:11,363 --> 00:45:13,002
- Seowon. - Yes?

877
00:45:13,002 --> 00:45:16,772
I heard you met with a crisis during practice.

878
00:45:18,673 --> 00:45:19,673
Yes, I did.

879
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:23,182
(The 1st day of the Vocal Unit's practice)

880
00:45:23,542 --> 00:45:25,582
Is everyone here aside from Seowon?

881
00:45:25,852 --> 00:45:27,082
I think so.

882
00:45:27,153 --> 00:45:29,252
Is Seowon sick?

883
00:45:29,352 --> 00:45:32,852
Should I ask Seowon what time she'll get here?

884
00:45:32,923 --> 00:45:35,193
She might be on her way. Maybe she's just a bit late.

885
00:45:35,193 --> 00:45:36,722
Being a bit late is no biggie.

886
00:45:36,923 --> 00:45:38,593
Wouldn't someone answer it?

887
00:45:39,263 --> 00:45:40,963
(Seowon isn't picking up her phone.)

888
00:45:40,963 --> 00:45:43,202
Wouldn't she pick up if she was in the car?

889
00:45:43,202 --> 00:45:45,903
- She might be asleep. - She would if she was in the car.

890
00:45:48,173 --> 00:45:49,903
Maybe she took some medicine before bed.

891
00:45:50,472 --> 00:45:53,312
Guys, Seowon caught the Influenza A.

892
00:45:53,312 --> 00:45:55,182
- Oh, my goodness. - She won't make it.

893
00:45:55,182 --> 00:45:56,713
Then what do we do?

894
00:45:56,783 --> 00:45:58,182
- What now? - What do we do?

895
00:45:58,182 --> 00:45:59,912
- What can we do? - She's really sick.

896
00:46:00,752 --> 00:46:06,053
(They can't work on the choreography due to Seowon's absence.)

897
00:46:06,423 --> 00:46:08,423
I miss you so much

898
00:46:08,423 --> 00:46:10,463
My all night prayer

899
00:46:10,463 --> 00:46:15,162
Since then, we were in a situation where we couldn't practice.

900
00:46:15,162 --> 00:46:17,403
It wasn't a good sign.

901
00:46:17,702 --> 00:46:20,733
All ten of us haven't been able to gather yet.

902
00:46:20,733 --> 00:46:23,102
What now? We have our lessons.

903
00:46:23,872 --> 00:46:25,943
- I'm at a loss. - The other units...

904
00:46:25,943 --> 00:46:27,472
must've made progress.

905
00:46:28,312 --> 00:46:29,843
I'm worried.

906
00:46:29,843 --> 00:46:34,153
(Their slow progress is making them worried.)

907
00:46:35,383 --> 00:46:38,923
We were the most unconfident unit.

908
00:46:41,193 --> 00:46:44,593
I couldn't help but think we were in danger.

909
00:46:45,392 --> 00:46:46,633
I miss you

910
00:46:47,233 --> 00:46:48,233
Again.

911
00:46:48,233 --> 00:46:52,772
(They practice the choreography without Seowon.)

912
00:46:52,772 --> 00:46:54,073
Again.

913
00:46:54,272 --> 00:46:55,743
Seven, eight.

914
00:46:56,042 --> 00:46:58,243
I miss you

915
00:46:58,243 --> 00:47:01,272
- That's it. Left, right. - Left, right.

916
00:47:03,743 --> 00:47:04,883
- Hey. - I love your hair.

917
00:47:04,883 --> 00:47:06,153
I caught a cold.

918
00:47:06,153 --> 00:47:07,352
(On the 3rd day, Seowon returned.)

919
00:47:07,352 --> 00:47:08,923
Didn't you catch a cold last week?

920
00:47:10,153 --> 00:47:11,352
It was my turn.

921
00:47:11,923 --> 00:47:13,493
- Let's do this. - Let's do this.

922
00:47:15,463 --> 00:47:17,763
Seowon looks the purest today.

923
00:47:17,823 --> 00:47:20,463
- You're right. - She's wearing the stage outfit.

924
00:47:20,463 --> 00:47:24,002
(The others break the ice for Seowon, who has been sick.)

925
00:47:24,263 --> 00:47:25,633
Let's practice with the song.

926
00:47:25,772 --> 00:47:27,872
Don't forget to stand in between others.

927
00:47:27,872 --> 00:47:30,372
(They dance together for the first time.)

928
00:47:31,812 --> 00:47:34,073
- Reaches the sky - Reaches the sky

929
00:47:35,113 --> 00:47:37,943
- I spent all night praying in tears - I spent all night praying in tears

930
00:47:37,943 --> 00:47:40,213
- I hope it reaches your heart - I hope it reaches your heart

931
00:47:40,213 --> 00:47:42,022
- The smile you showed me - The smile you showed me

932
00:47:42,022 --> 00:47:44,752
- Still remains in my heart - Still remains in my heart

933
00:47:44,752 --> 00:47:47,193
- Still remains in my heart - Still remains in my heart

934
00:47:47,423 --> 00:47:48,792
- Honestly - Honestly

935
00:47:48,792 --> 00:47:52,432
(Only Seowon turns to the other side.)

936
00:47:52,432 --> 00:47:55,533
- The longer I stay alone - The longer I stay alone

937
00:47:56,633 --> 00:48:01,133
(As she was absent, it's difficult to catch up with the choreography.)

938
00:48:01,432 --> 00:48:02,502
Oh, no.

939
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:09,883
(She feels utterly lost.)

940
00:48:10,113 --> 00:48:12,852
I hope the song with full of foolish regrets

941
00:48:13,883 --> 00:48:15,182
Gosh, please.

942
00:48:19,852 --> 00:48:21,193
(As she's still experiencing symptoms of the flu,)

943
00:48:21,193 --> 00:48:24,263
(she hasn't made a full recovery yet.)

944
00:48:25,693 --> 00:48:27,363
(In the end, Seowon stops practicing.)

945
00:48:28,133 --> 00:48:29,403
I was quite surprised.

946
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:32,932
She's been sick. She hasn't learned the dance yet.

947
00:48:38,972 --> 00:48:40,343
What am I going to do?

948
00:48:41,073 --> 00:48:42,783
I think I'm going to get eliminated.

949
00:48:43,642 --> 00:48:45,553
I lost in Round Three too.

950
00:48:45,852 --> 00:48:48,182
I really don't think I can do this now.

951
00:48:50,622 --> 00:48:52,752
It feels like I'm the only one struggling.

952
00:48:55,022 --> 00:48:57,423
If I weren't sick, I would have worked harder.

953
00:48:57,963 --> 00:48:59,693
I could have memorized everything.

954
00:49:02,202 --> 00:49:03,463
It's all my fault.

955
00:49:05,332 --> 00:49:08,033
(As she's frustrated, she blames herself.)

956
00:49:08,843 --> 00:49:10,472
I don't want to be eliminated.

957
00:49:13,272 --> 00:49:14,843
I can't stop crying.

958
00:49:22,682 --> 00:49:27,292
(She feels awful that Seowon is isolating herself from the group.)

959
00:49:32,533 --> 00:49:33,733
Do you need help?

960
00:49:34,263 --> 00:49:35,963
- What do you need help with? - I can't even sing now.

961
00:49:37,133 --> 00:49:38,432
Nothing's going to happen even if you can't memorize...

962
00:49:38,432 --> 00:49:39,702
- the dance by today. - Right.

963
00:49:39,832 --> 00:49:41,733
We're the Vocal Unit.

964
00:49:41,733 --> 00:49:43,173
You have a lot of time.

965
00:49:43,272 --> 00:49:44,872
- Thank you. - It's okay.

966
00:49:45,173 --> 00:49:47,443
Don't focus too much on the dance. You're a vocalist.

967
00:49:47,443 --> 00:49:49,283
- Actually, protect your voice. - You're a vocalist.

968
00:49:49,343 --> 00:49:50,483
Protect your voice.

969
00:49:55,783 --> 00:49:58,082
Hyeonju, does this go like this?

970
00:49:58,252 --> 00:49:59,722
One, two.

971
00:50:00,093 --> 00:50:01,122
Touch your thighs.

972
00:50:01,923 --> 00:50:02,963
Bring them up.

973
00:50:02,963 --> 00:50:04,662
To the head. And this.

974
00:50:05,432 --> 00:50:06,463
Sujin.

975
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:08,832
I don't know the choreography for this part. Can you teach me?

976
00:50:09,863 --> 00:50:12,272
I miss you

977
00:50:12,272 --> 00:50:15,133
(Her teammates help her as if they've been waiting for it.)

978
00:50:15,133 --> 00:50:17,843
I can feel the space between us at last

979
00:50:17,843 --> 00:50:19,412
Can you shorten your high notes?

980
00:50:19,412 --> 00:50:22,243
I can feel the space between us at last

981
00:50:22,642 --> 00:50:23,713
All right.

982
00:50:24,142 --> 00:50:26,483
I was struggling with the song.

983
00:50:26,553 --> 00:50:29,383
I often lost my pitch when I was practicing.

984
00:50:29,682 --> 00:50:31,383
Maintaining good condition also counts as a skill.

985
00:50:31,522 --> 00:50:34,553
So I thought I had to work harder.

986
00:50:38,792 --> 00:50:40,033
- Did you sing the song? - Yes.

987
00:50:40,033 --> 00:50:41,292
- Did you practice a lot? - Yes.

988
00:50:41,292 --> 00:50:42,832
- Wasn't it harder than you thought? - It was.

989
00:50:42,932 --> 00:50:45,573
- In a way, this is a ballad song. - Yes.

990
00:50:45,573 --> 00:50:48,133
It's not the type of performance you have been doing so far.

991
00:50:48,133 --> 00:50:49,602
So when you sing this song,

992
00:50:49,602 --> 00:50:52,243
we'll hear the raw side of your voice.

993
00:50:52,243 --> 00:50:53,812
- Right. - You guys are the vocalists.

994
00:50:53,812 --> 00:50:55,513
- Yes. - You're in the Vocal Unit.

995
00:50:55,513 --> 00:50:57,783
So I trust that all of you are talented vocalists.

996
00:50:58,213 --> 00:51:00,013
Let's record one person at a time.

997
00:51:00,013 --> 00:51:01,952
- Okay. - Let's record and keep talking.

998
00:51:11,392 --> 00:51:12,463
Oh, no.

999
00:51:12,832 --> 00:51:14,463
When she coughs, it sounds like she's suffocating.

1000
00:51:14,463 --> 00:51:17,233
(She hasn't recovered from the flu yet.)

1001
00:51:17,533 --> 00:51:19,673
- Let's try it. - I miss you so much

1002
00:51:19,772 --> 00:51:23,903
I am in tears, but how come

1003
00:51:25,243 --> 00:51:26,312
She's great.

1004
00:51:26,673 --> 00:51:27,943
- She's good. - Thank you.

1005
00:51:27,943 --> 00:51:29,013
She's good.

1006
00:51:30,142 --> 00:51:34,182
I am in tears, but how come

1007
00:51:35,153 --> 00:51:36,383
You're great. Let's hear it.

1008
00:51:36,383 --> 00:51:37,582
Thank you.

1009
00:51:42,423 --> 00:51:44,963
(It's hard to believe that she's still suffering from the flu.)

1010
00:51:45,662 --> 00:51:46,792
Let's do the next part.

1011
00:51:48,093 --> 00:51:49,263
She's a genius.

1012
00:51:50,162 --> 00:51:53,972
I don't care what you say

1013
00:51:53,972 --> 00:51:56,772
(She pulls off the high notes without a problem too.)

1014
00:51:56,772 --> 00:51:58,403
- There's a hint of sadness. - I mean...

1015
00:51:58,403 --> 00:51:59,713
Where did she get this sorrow?

1016
00:52:01,042 --> 00:52:02,383
Don't be hurt.

1017
00:52:02,783 --> 00:52:03,943
If you can hear

1018
00:52:04,513 --> 00:52:07,113
This song for you, come back to me

1019
00:52:07,682 --> 00:52:08,783
Great job. Come out.

1020
00:52:08,852 --> 00:52:10,222
Thank you.

1021
00:52:11,053 --> 00:52:12,352
- Elisia. - Yes. Hello.

1022
00:52:12,352 --> 00:52:14,423
- Start with "I was young." - Okay.

1023
00:52:14,423 --> 00:52:16,162
- Let's try it. - Okay.

1024
00:52:16,622 --> 00:52:18,392
I was young

1025
00:52:18,392 --> 00:52:20,133
I didn't know I would be like this

1026
00:52:20,133 --> 00:52:21,693
I took it for granted back then

1027
00:52:22,102 --> 00:52:23,162
I'm sorry.

1028
00:52:24,562 --> 00:52:26,702
- Okay. Let's try again. - Okay. Thank you.

1029
00:52:26,772 --> 00:52:30,073
I took it for granted back then

1030
00:52:30,772 --> 00:52:32,013
Gosh, your voice.

1031
00:52:32,513 --> 00:52:33,673
I'm sorry.

1032
00:52:33,673 --> 00:52:36,843
(Her voice is cracking up as she has the cold.)

1033
00:52:37,283 --> 00:52:38,983
Oh, no.

1034
00:52:39,682 --> 00:52:40,713
- Her voice is hoarse. - Yes.

1035
00:52:40,713 --> 00:52:42,582
Your voice is quite hoarse.

1036
00:52:42,582 --> 00:52:44,182
Your voice can't crack.

1037
00:52:44,252 --> 00:52:45,352
Yes.

1038
00:52:45,493 --> 00:52:46,993
So sadly...

1039
00:52:50,162 --> 00:52:52,932
It was tough because...

1040
00:52:52,932 --> 00:52:55,832
I'm still sick.

1041
00:52:55,832 --> 00:52:57,162
(She hasn't fully recovered from the cold.)

1042
00:52:57,162 --> 00:52:58,162
I'm sorry.

1043
00:52:58,162 --> 00:53:00,133
I took it for granted back then

1044
00:53:01,233 --> 00:53:02,272
Sorry.

1045
00:53:09,383 --> 00:53:12,283
(There's an X on top of Elisia's name.)

1046
00:53:12,452 --> 00:53:13,553
Seowon, can you go back in?

1047
00:53:15,783 --> 00:53:17,823
All right. Let's start with "I was young."

1048
00:53:17,823 --> 00:53:18,993
Okay.

1049
00:53:19,493 --> 00:53:22,863
(It was originally Elisia's part.)

1050
00:53:23,022 --> 00:53:24,222
"I was young." Okay.

1051
00:53:24,562 --> 00:53:26,693
If you can sing the part well,

1052
00:53:26,693 --> 00:53:28,693
- you will take the part. - Okay.

1053
00:53:31,102 --> 00:53:32,872
I was young

1054
00:53:32,872 --> 00:53:34,602
I didn't know I would be like this

1055
00:53:34,602 --> 00:53:37,772
I took it for granted back then

1056
00:53:38,102 --> 00:53:39,943
She's singing it in a different style.

1057
00:53:40,272 --> 00:53:41,272
But it's not bad.

1058
00:53:42,613 --> 00:53:44,113
- Wait. - Okay.

1059
00:53:49,452 --> 00:53:50,582
We don't need her to sing it again.

1060
00:53:51,423 --> 00:53:53,122
We'll go with Seowon for this.

1061
00:53:53,122 --> 00:53:55,153
Gosh. Thank you.

1062
00:53:55,153 --> 00:53:57,622
(Elisia's part goes to Seowon.)

1063
00:53:57,963 --> 00:53:59,133
I hate it.

1064
00:54:03,533 --> 00:54:04,863
How should I say it?

1065
00:54:05,303 --> 00:54:09,972
The thought that I had to protect my parts dominated me.

1066
00:54:10,872 --> 00:54:12,673
- Who's next? Yunha. - Yes.

1067
00:54:12,673 --> 00:54:14,113
(Yunha is up next.)

1068
00:54:14,113 --> 00:54:16,783
Yunha. Let's record the outro first.

1069
00:54:16,783 --> 00:54:17,783
Okay.

1070
00:54:18,912 --> 00:54:21,912
I hope the song with full of foolish regrets

1071
00:54:21,912 --> 00:54:24,082
Reaches the sky

1072
00:54:24,423 --> 00:54:26,122
Nice. I like your voice in the beginning.

1073
00:54:26,452 --> 00:54:29,193
I spent all night praying for you

1074
00:54:29,193 --> 00:54:31,792
I hope it reaches your heart

1075
00:54:31,892 --> 00:54:33,363
- She's good. - Nice.

1076
00:54:33,363 --> 00:54:34,662
- She's so good. - Great.

1077
00:54:35,702 --> 00:54:37,633
- Yunha is a great vocalist. - She is good.

1078
00:54:38,303 --> 00:54:41,573
I hate myself for realizing that now

1079
00:54:42,542 --> 00:54:44,173
Come back to me

1080
00:54:45,743 --> 00:54:47,472
Come back to me

1081
00:54:48,213 --> 00:54:49,682
She's really good.

1082
00:54:50,682 --> 00:54:51,783
Thank you.

1083
00:54:51,843 --> 00:54:53,213
I really feel like I should go back.

1084
00:54:54,013 --> 00:54:55,682
Gosh, she was great with this one.

1085
00:54:56,653 --> 00:54:58,283
Should we ask her to sing other parts?

1086
00:54:58,352 --> 00:55:00,653
- Since she's already recording? - Yes. Let's do that.

1087
00:55:03,693 --> 00:55:05,323
- Try "I'll be honest." - Okay.

1088
00:55:05,363 --> 00:55:06,932
- Sing two lines. - Okay.

1089
00:55:08,562 --> 00:55:11,533
(Sunwoo already finished recording the part.)

1090
00:55:11,533 --> 00:55:13,533
I still need to be loved

1091
00:55:13,872 --> 00:55:15,202
- It's the same melody. - Okay.

1092
00:55:15,202 --> 00:55:16,702
What's wrong? Your voice sounds a bit unstable today.

1093
00:55:16,702 --> 00:55:17,972
I'll try it.

1094
00:55:18,343 --> 00:55:19,443
Okay.

1095
00:55:19,772 --> 00:55:20,843
Come out for now.

1096
00:55:21,113 --> 00:55:22,383
Okay.

1097
00:55:22,383 --> 00:55:25,243
(She couldn't finish her part after getting negative feedback.)

1098
00:55:27,553 --> 00:55:28,952
- You have to pull it out. - Okay.

1099
00:55:30,682 --> 00:55:31,783
- Okay. - Your voice...

1100
00:55:31,783 --> 00:55:33,292
I'll be honest

1101
00:55:33,292 --> 00:55:36,722
I still need to be loved

1102
00:55:36,722 --> 00:55:38,662
The longer I stay alone

1103
00:55:38,662 --> 00:55:39,963
Nice. Great.

1104
00:55:39,963 --> 00:55:41,292
- Okay. - Let's do it. Try a few more times.

1105
00:55:41,292 --> 00:55:43,832
I still need to be loved

1106
00:55:44,432 --> 00:55:46,202
(Yunha ends up taking Sunwoo's part.)

1107
00:55:46,202 --> 00:55:47,932
Great. Well done.

1108
00:55:47,932 --> 00:55:49,173
- Wait. - Okay.

1109
00:55:49,372 --> 00:55:50,542
You're so good.

1110
00:55:50,542 --> 00:55:51,803
(Yunha ends up taking Sunwoo's part.)

1111
00:55:54,812 --> 00:55:56,713
Oh, my gosh. Why are you crying?

1112
00:55:56,713 --> 00:55:57,783
I'm okay.

1113
00:56:02,983 --> 00:56:04,252
- Yunha. - Yes.

1114
00:56:04,323 --> 00:56:05,323
Try singing the intro.

1115
00:56:05,323 --> 00:56:06,892
- The very first line. - Okay.

1116
00:56:06,892 --> 00:56:09,263
Sing all four lines in the intro.

1117
00:56:09,263 --> 00:56:10,323
Okay.

1118
00:56:12,392 --> 00:56:14,593
Some parts aren't assigned yet.

1119
00:56:14,593 --> 00:56:15,633
- Right. - Right.

1120
00:56:15,803 --> 00:56:17,463
(A solo performance in the middle and the beginning of the song)

1121
00:56:17,463 --> 00:56:21,502
(The intro is more important than any other part.)

1122
00:56:21,533 --> 00:56:24,173
I want to take the intro.

1123
00:56:24,372 --> 00:56:27,042
I want to sing the intro.

1124
00:56:27,073 --> 00:56:29,243
- The intro... - I want to do the intro.

1125
00:56:29,243 --> 00:56:31,483
I'm sure everyone wants to do the intro.

1126
00:56:34,082 --> 00:56:38,722
(Yunha only needs 2 more percent to advance to Level I.)

1127
00:56:39,122 --> 00:56:41,053
- Seowon, can you go in? - Me?

1128
00:56:44,292 --> 00:56:48,633
(Seowon isn't satisfied staying in Level I.)

1129
00:56:49,533 --> 00:56:54,403
(Getting a good part is more important than ever.)

1130
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:58,542
(Which one of them will take the intro part?)

1131
00:56:59,642 --> 00:57:01,573
Before we go up to the stage,

1132
00:57:01,573 --> 00:57:04,883
- we need to do one last inspection. - Okay.

1133
00:57:05,752 --> 00:57:07,752
You're right. It has two colors, black and brown.

1134
00:57:07,752 --> 00:57:08,783
- Nice. - Gosh.

1135
00:57:08,812 --> 00:57:11,182
- These lenses have two colors. - It matches her hair color well.

1136
00:57:13,952 --> 00:57:15,923
Your vibe definitely changed.

1137
00:57:15,923 --> 00:57:17,392
- You look wistfully beautiful. - You look so beautiful.

1138
00:57:17,493 --> 00:57:18,792
- You naturally look pretty. - She was already pretty.

1139
00:57:18,792 --> 00:57:19,832
- You look gorgeous. - Beautiful.

1140
00:57:20,892 --> 00:57:22,033
How do I look?

1141
00:57:22,033 --> 00:57:24,162
(Her makeover is perfect for the mood of the song.)

1142
00:57:24,162 --> 00:57:25,403
- Team "Beautiful." - Team "Beautiful."

1143
00:57:25,463 --> 00:57:27,502
- We can do this. - We can do this.

1144
00:57:27,502 --> 00:57:29,002
(They finish preparing for the performance.)

1145
00:57:29,002 --> 00:57:31,403
(It's time to give their all to their performance.)

1146
00:57:31,403 --> 00:57:33,472
Let's check out the performance of the Vocal Unit.

1147
00:57:33,613 --> 00:57:35,013
- Okay. - Okay.

1148
00:57:35,013 --> 00:57:36,243
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1149
00:57:36,243 --> 00:57:38,013
- Thank you. - Good luck.

1150
00:57:38,142 --> 00:57:39,182
Good luck.

1151
00:57:39,312 --> 00:57:41,053
- Good luck. - Good luck.

1152
00:57:46,553 --> 00:57:48,522
- Oh, no. - Seriously.

1153
00:57:48,792 --> 00:57:50,792
- She has to overcome this. - Poor thing.

1154
00:57:54,963 --> 00:57:57,062
(The producers seem full of worry as they watched the unit practice.)

1155
00:57:57,062 --> 00:57:59,202
(The producers seem full of worry as they watched the unit practice.)

1156
00:58:03,002 --> 00:58:04,602
(The entire team isn't feeling well.)

1157
00:58:04,602 --> 00:58:09,142
(Can they overcome this?)

1158
00:58:09,783 --> 00:58:10,812
Good luck.

1159
00:58:33,173 --> 00:58:35,303
("Beautiful" by Kim Sujin, Bang Yunha, Elisia,)

1160
00:58:35,303 --> 00:58:37,343
(Lee Sunwoo, Lim Seowon, Gehlee Dangca, Jin Hyeonju)

1161
00:59:33,062 --> 00:59:34,332
- Gosh. - Nice.

1162
00:59:51,943 --> 00:59:52,952
I got goosebumps.

1163
01:00:17,502 --> 01:00:18,843
How beautiful.

1164
01:01:56,403 --> 01:01:57,443
They did well.

1165
01:02:06,252 --> 01:02:07,352
- Gosh. - They were so good.

1166
01:02:07,352 --> 01:02:08,713
They were beautiful. I got goosebumps.

1167
01:02:09,883 --> 01:02:11,423
- They did well. - They were amazing.

1168
01:02:11,423 --> 01:02:12,452
That was awesome.

1169
01:02:12,792 --> 01:02:13,792
I'm tearing up.

1170
01:02:13,792 --> 01:02:15,553
- This is so touching. - Gosh, they're amazing vocalists.

1171
01:02:15,553 --> 01:02:17,392
- Right. - This was emotional.

1172
01:02:18,662 --> 01:02:19,693
I'm so touched.

1173
01:02:22,432 --> 01:02:23,463
Thank you.

1174
01:02:23,463 --> 01:02:26,673
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1175
01:02:28,372 --> 01:02:29,372
Thank you.

1176
01:02:29,602 --> 01:02:30,972
Well, when I first...

1177
01:02:31,472 --> 01:02:34,013
heard that you were going to sing this song,

1178
01:02:34,013 --> 01:02:36,642
I was quite worried, honestly speaking.

1179
01:02:38,412 --> 01:02:42,352
I was very worried about how you were going to execute this song.

1180
01:02:42,352 --> 01:02:44,483
First of all, the song suited you well.

1181
01:02:44,483 --> 01:02:46,593
It was like a chorus of angels.

1182
01:02:46,952 --> 01:02:49,252
I enjoyed your performance.

1183
01:02:50,562 --> 01:02:53,993
Among everyone, Yunha...

1184
01:02:54,733 --> 01:02:57,133
You're not feeling your best, right?

1185
01:02:58,062 --> 01:03:00,233
My throat is very dry.

1186
01:03:01,102 --> 01:03:03,403
- I'm sorry. - But...

1187
01:03:03,803 --> 01:03:05,202
- I bet she's so disappointed. - Yes.

1188
01:03:05,202 --> 01:03:10,843
But I think it was you who shaped the overall texture of the song.

1189
01:03:10,843 --> 01:03:13,483
Despite the fact that you weren't feeling your best,

1190
01:03:13,483 --> 01:03:14,553
you did a great job.

1191
01:03:14,553 --> 01:03:16,222
- And... - Thank you.

1192
01:03:17,252 --> 01:03:18,483
That's a huge compliment.

1193
01:03:20,093 --> 01:03:23,263
Seowon. Today, you're in the Vocal Unit.

1194
01:03:23,263 --> 01:03:24,993
So I'll only talk about your singing.

1195
01:03:25,292 --> 01:03:27,892
You're a great singer. You're beautiful...

1196
01:03:27,892 --> 01:03:30,062
and confident. These are your good qualities.

1197
01:03:30,403 --> 01:03:34,202
I believe the deeper your understanding of the song gets,

1198
01:03:34,202 --> 01:03:36,872
the more you will improve. I'm looking forward to seeing that.

1199
01:03:37,202 --> 01:03:39,002
- Thank you. - Good job, everyone.

1200
01:03:39,002 --> 01:03:40,113
Good work.

1201
01:03:40,113 --> 01:03:41,213
(Her performance always makes them look forward to the next one.)

1202
01:03:41,213 --> 01:03:44,412
Seowon. Actually, you were very good at centering the performance.

1203
01:03:44,412 --> 01:03:47,352
So overall, you guys delivered a solid performance.

1204
01:03:47,352 --> 01:03:49,423
But I was surprised...

1205
01:03:49,423 --> 01:03:52,993
when Elisia sang, "This feels strange."

1206
01:03:53,323 --> 01:03:55,752
You looked as if you were going to cry.

1207
01:03:56,363 --> 01:03:59,493
I could see that you were trying to convey the emotion.

1208
01:04:01,292 --> 01:04:04,033
(Elisia is excellent at expressing her emotions.)

1209
01:04:04,562 --> 01:04:06,932
(Seowon has solid singing skills.)

1210
01:04:08,173 --> 01:04:10,042
(Their voices together created a bigger synergy.)

1211
01:04:10,042 --> 01:04:12,673
I realized that the chemistry between you two was great...

1212
01:04:12,673 --> 01:04:15,173
through this performance.

1213
01:04:16,912 --> 01:04:18,613
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1214
01:04:21,252 --> 01:04:24,022
Vocal Unit, go down the stage...

1215
01:04:24,022 --> 01:04:25,323
and wait for a moment.

1216
01:04:25,323 --> 01:04:27,323
- Okay. Thank you. - Okay. Thank you.

1217
01:04:28,852 --> 01:04:32,693
(They must pick one person from the unit to promote.)

1218
01:04:33,263 --> 01:04:35,392
She suited the mood of the song better.

1219
01:04:35,392 --> 01:04:36,832
- But as we talked about, - Yes.

1220
01:04:36,832 --> 01:04:40,332
the one with solid singing skills during the performance was Seowon.

1221
01:04:40,332 --> 01:04:41,372
- I agree. - Yes.

1222
01:04:41,472 --> 01:04:43,102
If we were to consider...

1223
01:04:43,102 --> 01:04:44,772
the understanding and execution of the song,

1224
01:04:45,142 --> 01:04:48,372
Yunha and Elisia did well, in my opinion.

1225
01:04:48,772 --> 01:04:51,843
One of the reasons I wanted to promote Yunha is this.

1226
01:04:52,443 --> 01:04:54,613
Despite the fact that she wasn't feeling well,

1227
01:04:54,613 --> 01:04:57,823
she was the one who created the texture of the song the best.

1228
01:04:57,823 --> 01:05:01,292
If she was in good condition and I could see her skills,

1229
01:05:01,752 --> 01:05:04,022
- I would have chosen her. - Right.

1230
01:05:04,022 --> 01:05:06,093
But I might regret doing that...

1231
01:05:06,533 --> 01:05:09,062
because that didn't stand out, to be honest with you.

1232
01:05:09,062 --> 01:05:11,162
It's a bit difficult to say she showed her talent.

1233
01:05:11,162 --> 01:05:12,662
Actually, girls like Seowon who kept...

1234
01:05:12,662 --> 01:05:14,133
- the performance centered... - She was solid.

1235
01:05:14,133 --> 01:05:15,533
stood out. That's how I felt personally.

1236
01:05:15,533 --> 01:05:17,542
- Seowon did stand out. - Right.

1237
01:05:17,542 --> 01:05:18,542
I see.

1238
01:05:18,542 --> 01:05:19,972
This one is difficult.

1239
01:05:20,312 --> 01:05:21,443
- Seriously. - Right.

1240
01:05:21,912 --> 01:05:23,483
Being a judge on a competition show is so hard.

1241
01:05:23,483 --> 01:05:24,513
Totally.

1242
01:05:24,843 --> 01:05:27,013
Vocal Unit. Come up to the stage.

1243
01:05:27,553 --> 01:05:28,653
Hello.

1244
01:05:30,053 --> 01:05:31,352
Hello.

1245
01:05:31,352 --> 01:05:35,323
- Hello. - Hello.

1246
01:05:35,323 --> 01:05:36,363
Hello.

1247
01:05:38,392 --> 01:05:39,463
They must be nervous.

1248
01:05:41,033 --> 01:05:42,693
Who do you think will get promoted?

1249
01:05:44,662 --> 01:05:45,932
- Yunha? - I agree.

1250
01:05:46,332 --> 01:05:47,903
- She got a lot of compliments. - Yes.

1251
01:05:49,573 --> 01:05:52,972
It was a split decision even for us...

1252
01:05:52,972 --> 01:05:54,472
on whom to choose.

1253
01:05:56,042 --> 01:05:57,383
It was difficult to pick one person.

1254
01:05:58,713 --> 01:06:03,153
First of all, Seowon held the performance together.

1255
01:06:03,153 --> 01:06:07,193
You were the best at taking care of your condition...

1256
01:06:07,193 --> 01:06:09,562
based on what we heard from the performance today.

1257
01:06:10,022 --> 01:06:11,863
So some of us thought Seowon should be promoted.

1258
01:06:11,863 --> 01:06:14,332
Yunha. As for you,

1259
01:06:14,332 --> 01:06:15,733
if you were feeling better,

1260
01:06:15,733 --> 01:06:20,533
we thought this would have been the perfect performance for you.

1261
01:06:20,772 --> 01:06:23,443
You understood the emotions of the song well...

1262
01:06:23,443 --> 01:06:25,343
and shaped the texture of the song.

1263
01:06:26,743 --> 01:06:29,272
We were torn between the two of you.

1264
01:06:29,272 --> 01:06:31,113
It was so hard to choose one.

1265
01:06:35,553 --> 01:06:37,352
The person getting promoted in the Vocal Unit is...

1266
01:06:45,363 --> 01:06:47,993
(To be continued)

1267
01:06:51,374 --> 01:06:53,174
The person getting promoted in the Vocal Unit is...

1268
01:07:04,183 --> 01:07:05,413
Lim Seowon.

1269
01:07:06,314 --> 01:07:08,254
(In the Vocal Unit, Lim Seowon wins the promotion.)

1270
01:07:08,254 --> 01:07:09,683
- You've been promoted... - Congratulations.

1271
01:07:09,683 --> 01:07:10,894
to Level R.

1272
01:07:11,624 --> 01:07:13,053
Thank you.

1273
01:07:13,894 --> 01:07:17,123
(Lim Seowon)

1274
01:07:17,123 --> 01:07:18,263
Don't cry.

1275
01:07:18,263 --> 01:07:20,164
- Why are you crying? - Don't cry.

1276
01:07:20,394 --> 01:07:21,833
Thank you.

1277
01:07:22,633 --> 01:07:24,003
Oh, dear.

1278
01:07:24,473 --> 01:07:25,774
Thank you.

1279
01:07:28,404 --> 01:07:29,904
I'll work hard.

1280
01:07:34,543 --> 01:07:36,213
(Following Nana, she has joined Level R.)

1281
01:07:36,213 --> 01:07:38,053
- Level R. - That's amazing.

1282
01:07:38,354 --> 01:07:40,284
Well, you see...

1283
01:07:40,284 --> 01:07:41,984
How you manage to stay in good shape...

1284
01:07:41,984 --> 01:07:43,954
- should be one of the criteria. - Yes.

1285
01:07:44,354 --> 01:07:45,654
- That's just how it is. - You're right.

1286
01:07:46,354 --> 01:07:47,664
I feel bad, though.

1287
01:07:47,894 --> 01:07:49,923
I know. I feel really bad too.

1288
01:07:50,364 --> 01:07:52,664
Let's now watch the Performance Unit's performance.

1289
01:07:53,564 --> 01:07:54,963
Please come up to the stage.

1290
01:07:56,364 --> 01:07:59,503
- Performance. - "LOCO," let's go!

1291
01:07:59,604 --> 01:08:01,144
"LOCO."

1292
01:08:01,144 --> 01:08:03,043
- I was looking forward to this. - "LOCO," let's go.

1293
01:08:05,644 --> 01:08:07,013
- Come on! - Here they come.

1294
01:08:07,114 --> 01:08:08,183
- Hello. - Hello.

1295
01:08:08,183 --> 01:08:10,144
They've got killer charisma.

1296
01:08:10,484 --> 01:08:12,154
- Hello. - Hello.

1297
01:08:12,154 --> 01:08:14,484
- Hello. - Oh, my gosh. I'm so excited.

1298
01:08:14,484 --> 01:08:17,354
(The Performance Unit makes an imposing entrance.)

1299
01:08:17,694 --> 01:08:19,923
They already seem like female warriors.

1300
01:08:20,894 --> 01:08:23,824
- What an amazing group. - They really are.

1301
01:08:24,364 --> 01:08:27,364
Narumi looks quite different now, doesn't she?

1302
01:08:27,364 --> 01:08:29,234
- She looks so much better. - You're right.

1303
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:33,574
With that kind of look, she almost seems unfamiliar.

1304
01:08:33,574 --> 01:08:35,003
I know, right?

1305
01:08:36,244 --> 01:08:38,973
Performance Unit, please introduce yourselves first.

1306
01:08:41,414 --> 01:08:43,814
- Who do you think you are? - Who do you think you are?

1307
01:08:44,013 --> 01:08:45,713
- Hello, we are... - Hello, we are...

1308
01:08:45,713 --> 01:08:47,824
- the Performance Unit. - the Performance Unit.

1309
01:08:47,824 --> 01:08:49,454
(The last Unit Station, the Performance Unit)

1310
01:08:49,923 --> 01:08:52,293
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1311
01:08:53,793 --> 01:08:56,324
Nizi, I heard that you were picked...

1312
01:08:56,324 --> 01:08:59,194
as the person who's likely to get promoted.

1313
01:08:59,793 --> 01:09:03,333
Who do you think will get promoted?

1314
01:09:04,873 --> 01:09:06,074
I think...

1315
01:09:06,574 --> 01:09:08,204
it'll be Narumi.

1316
01:09:08,204 --> 01:09:10,173
(She thinks Narumi will get promoted.)

1317
01:09:10,173 --> 01:09:11,414
It's because...

1318
01:09:13,543 --> 01:09:17,114
she got all the parts...

1319
01:09:17,314 --> 01:09:20,284
that we all wanted.

1320
01:09:20,984 --> 01:09:23,484
- Really? - You lost them all...

1321
01:09:23,553 --> 01:09:24,923
to Narumi?

1322
01:09:25,253 --> 01:09:26,293
Sorry?

1323
01:09:26,723 --> 01:09:28,524
- She lost them all to her. - Yes.

1324
01:09:28,763 --> 01:09:30,963
The one who got more parts certainly becomes your competitor.

1325
01:09:30,963 --> 01:09:32,064
You're right.

1326
01:09:32,064 --> 01:09:36,064
(What happened to the Performance Unit?)

1327
01:09:36,164 --> 01:09:37,933
All right. Those who got promoted...

1328
01:09:38,673 --> 01:09:40,904
will choose their positions first.

1329
01:09:40,904 --> 01:09:41,973
(Those who won the Unicorn Ticket got to pick first.)

1330
01:09:41,973 --> 01:09:42,973
Go.

1331
01:09:44,213 --> 01:09:45,244
They're running.

1332
01:09:49,944 --> 01:09:52,053
- Wait, what? - What?

1333
01:09:52,314 --> 01:09:53,954
- Performance. - They all picked performance.

1334
01:09:53,954 --> 01:09:55,723
- All of them? - It's filling up already.

1335
01:09:56,354 --> 01:09:57,623
No.

1336
01:09:57,623 --> 01:09:59,024
(The majority of them chose performance.)

1337
01:09:59,954 --> 01:10:03,364
Five of us picked it, and I knew it was going to be competitive.

1338
01:10:03,824 --> 01:10:06,734
(The unit was formed with 5 members who got the Unicorns' approval.)

1339
01:10:06,833 --> 01:10:10,364
I thought it wasn't going to be easy.

1340
01:10:11,803 --> 01:10:16,104
Everyone has strong energy,

1341
01:10:16,473 --> 01:10:22,114
so I was worried that I might not be able to stand out.

1342
01:10:22,683 --> 01:10:25,114
(Who's your biggest competition?)

1343
01:10:25,454 --> 01:10:31,454
If only one of us can get promoted,

1344
01:10:31,793 --> 01:10:33,194
Nizi would be...

1345
01:10:33,553 --> 01:10:36,923
The one that I should watch out for would be Nizi.

1346
01:10:37,123 --> 01:10:40,333
At the 1-on-1 Battle, Nizi did a great job performing...

1347
01:10:40,333 --> 01:10:42,164
"LOCO" by ITZY with a lot of charisma.

1348
01:10:42,364 --> 01:10:46,534
(Nizi performed "LOCO" by ITZY at the 1-on-1 Battle.)

1349
01:10:47,003 --> 01:10:49,873
(She proved her potential, winning the battle 5-0.)

1350
01:10:49,873 --> 01:10:52,213
I think Nizi will be able to do...

1351
01:10:52,373 --> 01:10:55,583
an amazing job performing this song.

1352
01:10:56,043 --> 01:10:59,513
(Everyone in the Performance Unit is watching out for Nizi.)

1353
01:10:59,513 --> 01:11:01,824
Will we be covering the original choreography as it is?

1354
01:11:02,053 --> 01:11:04,293
- The dance video is in there. - What?

1355
01:11:05,894 --> 01:11:07,053
- Wait. - I'm excited.

1356
01:11:07,053 --> 01:11:09,223
- I can't wait. - One, two, three.

1357
01:11:10,164 --> 01:11:13,293
(They watch the dance video of "LOCO.")

1358
01:11:18,173 --> 01:11:22,604
(The choreography was adapted for the Performance Unit.)

1359
01:11:22,604 --> 01:11:26,873
(It requires them to dance dynamically and powerfully.)

1360
01:11:28,414 --> 01:11:29,914
I was surprised.

1361
01:11:30,183 --> 01:11:34,183
First of all, it was very different from the original choreography.

1362
01:11:37,223 --> 01:11:39,723
Unlike the original choreography of "LOCO,"

1363
01:11:39,723 --> 01:11:41,963
it involved a lot of technical moves.

1364
01:11:42,263 --> 01:11:45,093
(The choreography has many difficult moves.)

1365
01:11:48,303 --> 01:11:49,633
Come on, really?

1366
01:11:49,633 --> 01:11:51,933
(The acrobatic moves continue.)

1367
01:11:52,074 --> 01:11:54,574
- Gosh, this is no joke. - This is crazy.

1368
01:11:54,574 --> 01:11:56,303
This choreography is epic.

1369
01:11:56,604 --> 01:11:58,373
This is totally crazy.

1370
01:12:00,314 --> 01:12:03,614
It seemed physically demanding,

1371
01:12:03,614 --> 01:12:07,213
and I was quite worried.

1372
01:12:07,553 --> 01:12:09,324
I feel like I can't breathe.

1373
01:12:09,324 --> 01:12:10,654
(They're overwhelmed.)

1374
01:12:10,994 --> 01:12:14,263
Can everyone do the splits?

1375
01:12:14,494 --> 01:12:16,364
Jayla, could you try it?

1376
01:12:16,364 --> 01:12:17,534
With Gyoryeon.

1377
01:12:17,593 --> 01:12:19,694
(Gyoryeon fails.)

1378
01:12:21,263 --> 01:12:23,133
(Jayla fails.)

1379
01:12:23,333 --> 01:12:25,433
(The Performance Unit is surprisingly inflexible.)

1380
01:12:25,833 --> 01:12:29,673
(Will the Performance Unit be able to pull off the choreography?)

1381
01:12:30,043 --> 01:12:32,473
(Next day)

1382
01:12:33,543 --> 01:12:36,484
(It's like they're athletes in training.)

1383
01:12:37,183 --> 01:12:40,414
(The Performance Unit is busy warming up.)

1384
01:12:40,923 --> 01:12:42,123
(Glancing)

1385
01:12:43,253 --> 01:12:48,723
(Nizi pulls off the difficult moves alone.)

1386
01:12:50,263 --> 01:12:51,534
(Glancing)

1387
01:12:51,963 --> 01:12:53,194
(Glancing)

1388
01:12:54,404 --> 01:12:57,364
I thought Nizi had...

1389
01:12:57,604 --> 01:13:01,274
such great skills despite her young age.

1390
01:13:01,543 --> 01:13:02,574
The look in her eyes.

1391
01:13:04,003 --> 01:13:05,144
That's insane!

1392
01:13:05,644 --> 01:13:08,444
(Nizi has already mastered the choreography.)

1393
01:13:08,543 --> 01:13:09,683
How old is she?

1394
01:13:09,683 --> 01:13:11,253
- She's only 13. - She's 13.

1395
01:13:11,253 --> 01:13:12,513
You've got to be kidding me.

1396
01:13:13,013 --> 01:13:17,324
(Nizi who's only 13 intimidates the older members.)

1397
01:13:19,494 --> 01:13:22,324
Nizi, the youngest member of our team,

1398
01:13:22,463 --> 01:13:24,933
is so good at both singing and dancing.

1399
01:13:25,293 --> 01:13:27,034
I'm older than her, but...

1400
01:13:29,763 --> 01:13:33,133
Well, to be honest,

1401
01:13:34,673 --> 01:13:36,003
Nizi is...

1402
01:13:36,774 --> 01:13:37,914
someone I want to beat.

1403
01:13:38,843 --> 01:13:42,183
A rival. I think she's my rival.

1404
01:13:43,043 --> 01:13:46,253
(Narumi challenges Nizi.)

1405
01:13:49,854 --> 01:13:51,423
(I want to beat Nizi.)

1406
01:13:52,394 --> 01:13:58,194
Narumi is really strict on herself.

1407
01:14:01,204 --> 01:14:05,774
Narumi worked so hard.

1408
01:14:06,373 --> 01:14:11,043
(She keeps practicing even during the break.)

1409
01:14:12,314 --> 01:14:16,043
I thought that those who go up to the top would be people like her.

1410
01:14:16,244 --> 01:14:18,314
(Narumi continues to practice nonstop.)

1411
01:14:18,314 --> 01:14:21,183
- What? - Way to go, Narumi.

1412
01:14:22,154 --> 01:14:27,494
I'll work hard to show you my best.

1413
01:14:28,394 --> 01:14:29,623
Let's go, Narumi.

1414
01:14:29,623 --> 01:14:31,164
(Let's go, Narumi.)

1415
01:14:33,034 --> 01:14:40,534
(Narumi got the center position and highlight through hard work.)

1416
01:14:49,744 --> 01:14:51,683
I won't let anyone else take it.

1417
01:14:52,753 --> 01:14:55,253
(However...)

1418
01:14:55,784 --> 01:14:58,793
(There's still a part that hasn't been assigned to anyone yet?)

1419
01:14:59,053 --> 01:15:01,564
It's the part that goes, "So dangerous."

1420
01:15:02,723 --> 01:15:04,793
It hasn't been assigned to anyone yet.

1421
01:15:05,234 --> 01:15:09,064
(It's the only part with a solo dance.)

1422
01:15:09,534 --> 01:15:13,704
The part I wanted the most was where it goes,

1423
01:15:13,803 --> 01:15:15,303
"So dangerous."

1424
01:15:15,303 --> 01:15:17,144
I was scared.

1425
01:15:17,944 --> 01:15:20,614
Nizi and I are staying at the same dorm,

1426
01:15:20,873 --> 01:15:23,083
and she really wanted that part.

1427
01:15:24,244 --> 01:15:25,713
I knew she did,

1428
01:15:26,253 --> 01:15:29,183
and it really scared me.

1429
01:15:29,954 --> 01:15:33,494
(Nizi practices the solo dance to get the part.)

1430
01:15:33,494 --> 01:15:35,694
Yes, I'm a little nervous.

1431
01:15:36,223 --> 01:15:39,093
Guys, we'll decide who will get the "So dangerous" part today.

1432
01:15:39,093 --> 01:15:40,633
Does anyone want to do it?

1433
01:15:40,633 --> 01:15:42,164
- Who practiced it? - Me.

1434
01:15:42,633 --> 01:15:44,503
One, two, three, four, five, six.

1435
01:15:44,503 --> 01:15:45,633
Okay, six people.

1436
01:15:45,633 --> 01:15:47,074
(The competition for the solo dance begins.)

1437
01:15:47,074 --> 01:15:48,244
(Candidate 1, Bae Haram)

1438
01:15:48,604 --> 01:15:50,644
(Candidate 2, Bae Yeram)

1439
01:15:51,003 --> 01:15:54,244
(Candidate 3, Yuri)

1440
01:15:54,914 --> 01:15:57,854
(Candidate 4, Goo Gryoryeon)

1441
01:15:57,914 --> 01:15:59,683
Nizi, you're up next. Let's go.

1442
01:15:59,683 --> 01:16:00,713
- Good luck. - Good luck.

1443
01:16:00,713 --> 01:16:01,753
- Good luck. - Let's go.

1444
01:16:05,024 --> 01:16:07,623
(Nervous)

1445
01:16:08,793 --> 01:16:15,534
(Candidate 5, Nizi)

1446
01:16:17,873 --> 01:16:19,604
- Who's next? Let's go. - Next.

1447
01:16:19,604 --> 01:16:21,244
- Go! - Good luck.

1448
01:16:21,244 --> 01:16:22,444
- Ready? - I'll do my best.

1449
01:16:25,574 --> 01:16:30,583
(Candidate 6, Narumi)

1450
01:16:30,784 --> 01:16:33,383
(Screaming)

1451
01:16:34,354 --> 01:16:35,354
(You're the best!)

1452
01:16:35,354 --> 01:16:36,524
Way to go, Narumi!

1453
01:16:36,524 --> 01:16:38,053
- Great job. - Let's go.

1454
01:16:38,394 --> 01:16:43,394
(Who will get the solo dance?)

1455
01:16:43,694 --> 01:16:46,234
All right. I've given it some thought.

1456
01:16:47,963 --> 01:16:51,673
I think the dance would look better if it was done by someone tall,

1457
01:16:51,673 --> 01:16:53,133
so I'm going to go with Narumi.

1458
01:16:53,133 --> 01:16:54,774
(Narumi wins the solo dance.)

1459
01:16:54,774 --> 01:16:57,144
But Narumi, if you don't do well,

1460
01:16:57,144 --> 01:16:58,744
- I'll give it to someone else. - Okay.

1461
01:16:58,744 --> 01:17:00,914
- You should keep practicing, okay? - Yes.

1462
01:17:00,914 --> 01:17:02,114
- Sure. - All right.

1463
01:17:02,843 --> 01:17:09,154
She said the dance would be better for someone tall,

1464
01:17:09,524 --> 01:17:11,324
so I got the part.

1465
01:17:11,994 --> 01:17:14,824
I'll eat more and work harder.

1466
01:17:15,423 --> 01:17:18,263
(Interim check)

1467
01:17:19,534 --> 01:17:20,933
Oh, my gosh.

1468
01:17:22,534 --> 01:17:27,873
(They're doing a great job like it's the actual performance.)

1469
01:17:30,574 --> 01:17:33,543
Oh gosh, this is like sweet poison

1470
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:37,784
Kitty looking for an oasis

1471
01:17:37,784 --> 01:17:40,013
I hover around you

1472
01:17:40,683 --> 01:17:42,053
Oh, my goodness.

1473
01:17:42,984 --> 01:17:48,293
(They drew heated responses at the interim check.)

1474
01:17:48,293 --> 01:17:50,164
That was insane.

1475
01:17:50,164 --> 01:17:52,364
- Nizi! - My gosh!

1476
01:17:52,364 --> 01:17:54,034
That was fire.

1477
01:17:54,194 --> 01:17:55,364
They were terrific.

1478
01:17:55,364 --> 01:17:57,364
- That was amazing. - Really.

1479
01:17:57,564 --> 01:18:00,034
(Their performance at the interim check was a success.)

1480
01:18:00,034 --> 01:18:04,873
I think all my practice and hard work...

1481
01:18:05,043 --> 01:18:06,213
paid off.

1482
01:18:07,043 --> 01:18:09,513
(That night)

1483
01:18:09,883 --> 01:18:12,883
(What's the result of the interim check?)

1484
01:18:13,784 --> 01:18:14,883
Nizi.

1485
01:18:14,883 --> 01:18:16,553
Nizi got a lot of it.

1486
01:18:16,723 --> 01:18:18,494
(Performance)

1487
01:18:18,494 --> 01:18:20,654
(Narumi, Nizi)

1488
01:18:21,364 --> 01:18:23,194
- Nizi. - Nizi.

1489
01:18:24,194 --> 01:18:25,593
Nizi got a lot of it.

1490
01:18:25,963 --> 01:18:32,433
(Nizi got 13 votes as the one who's most likely to get promoted.)

1491
01:18:32,433 --> 01:18:33,604
Nizi.

1492
01:18:34,944 --> 01:18:36,444
She got the most votes.

1493
01:18:39,213 --> 01:18:40,414
Look at that.

1494
01:18:40,414 --> 01:18:42,944
On Team "LOCO,"

1495
01:18:43,414 --> 01:18:47,314
I'm the one who got the most impactful parts.

1496
01:18:47,654 --> 01:18:50,623
But only two people picked me...

1497
01:18:51,293 --> 01:18:53,954
as the person who's likely to get promoted,

1498
01:18:54,664 --> 01:18:55,824
which was a disappointment.

1499
01:18:57,524 --> 01:18:58,994
Nizi, you're amazing.

1500
01:18:58,994 --> 01:19:00,093
Nizi.

1501
01:19:00,463 --> 01:19:06,373
Nizi who got fewer parts than me...

1502
01:19:06,774 --> 01:19:11,074
received a lot of votes,

1503
01:19:11,543 --> 01:19:13,274
and it was a little frustrating.

1504
01:19:13,274 --> 01:19:15,114
(It was a little frustrating.)

1505
01:19:15,484 --> 01:19:17,683
(Narumi worked hard to get the good parts,)

1506
01:19:17,883 --> 01:19:22,553
(but she couldn't outperform Nizi.)

1507
01:19:25,553 --> 01:19:31,534
(What will happen to them?)

1508
01:19:31,534 --> 01:19:34,064
The Performance Unit. Let's see what you've got, shall we?

1509
01:19:34,263 --> 01:19:36,034
- Yes. - Yes.

1510
01:19:36,404 --> 01:19:39,104
- Good luck. - Good luck.

1511
01:19:39,234 --> 01:19:40,274
Here we go.

1512
01:19:40,274 --> 01:19:41,503
I'm so excited.

1513
01:19:41,503 --> 01:19:43,204
- "LOCO"! - They're the real deal.

1514
01:19:43,204 --> 01:19:44,343
I'm so excited.

1515
01:19:44,473 --> 01:19:46,644
- I can't wait to see it. - I know, right?

1516
01:19:46,644 --> 01:19:47,873
I'm so excited.

1517
01:19:48,244 --> 01:19:49,343
I think they'll do a good job.

1518
01:20:15,244 --> 01:20:16,644
("LOCO" by Narumi, Nizi, Jayla, Goo Gryoryeon,)

1519
01:20:16,644 --> 01:20:17,803
(Yuri, Bae Yeram, Bae Haram, Jeon Jinyeong)

1520
01:20:58,083 --> 01:20:59,114
My goodness.

1521
01:21:24,503 --> 01:21:25,644
They're doing great.

1522
01:22:10,454 --> 01:22:11,923
Look at Narumi!

1523
01:22:43,253 --> 01:22:44,753
Let's go!

1524
01:23:25,364 --> 01:23:26,933
Oh, my gosh!

1525
01:23:27,364 --> 01:23:29,364
- That was insane. - They're so good.

1526
01:23:30,204 --> 01:23:32,904
- That's our Performance Unit. - They killed it.

1527
01:23:32,933 --> 01:23:34,104
They killed it!

1528
01:23:34,104 --> 01:23:35,843
- That was incredible. - Awesome.

1529
01:23:37,104 --> 01:23:39,013
How can you possibly pick one of them?

1530
01:23:39,013 --> 01:23:40,873
I am shocked.

1531
01:23:43,183 --> 01:23:44,383
That was great.

1532
01:23:44,713 --> 01:23:45,784
Well done.

1533
01:23:46,854 --> 01:23:47,883
That was powerful.

1534
01:23:47,954 --> 01:23:49,223
They did a great job.

1535
01:23:50,454 --> 01:23:52,253
Gosh, what a surprise.

1536
01:23:52,654 --> 01:23:53,753
What a surprise.

1537
01:23:58,263 --> 01:23:59,933
I thought my eyes were going to pop out.

1538
01:24:00,933 --> 01:24:02,003
Seriously.

1539
01:24:02,003 --> 01:24:03,503
What a surprise.

1540
01:24:04,303 --> 01:24:05,833
That was so intense.

1541
01:24:07,404 --> 01:24:10,104
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1542
01:24:11,473 --> 01:24:17,343
(They're all out of breath.)

1543
01:24:19,484 --> 01:24:20,713
You know...

1544
01:24:21,923 --> 01:24:23,623
There's no need for words.

1545
01:24:23,623 --> 01:24:27,123
You're a group of amazing dancers.

1546
01:24:27,923 --> 01:24:32,164
There were so many difficult technical moves,

1547
01:24:32,164 --> 01:24:34,034
and you pulled them off perfectly.

1548
01:24:35,263 --> 01:24:37,864
- There were so many iconic scenes. - Really.

1549
01:24:37,864 --> 01:24:39,333
I thought you were just going to dance,

1550
01:24:39,333 --> 01:24:40,973
but you also sang, right?

1551
01:24:41,003 --> 01:24:42,074
- Yes. - Yes.

1552
01:24:42,543 --> 01:24:43,574
I really...

1553
01:24:45,274 --> 01:24:47,543
I don't even know what to say.

1554
01:24:47,843 --> 01:24:49,284
What did you guys think?

1555
01:24:51,543 --> 01:24:53,083
First of all,

1556
01:24:53,284 --> 01:24:56,083
you guys had really good teamwork.

1557
01:24:56,083 --> 01:24:58,553
- Right? - That must've taken a lot of work.

1558
01:24:58,623 --> 01:24:59,994
You weren't just dancing.

1559
01:24:59,994 --> 01:25:02,864
There were some iconic moves,

1560
01:25:02,864 --> 01:25:05,263
and all of them were so on point.

1561
01:25:05,263 --> 01:25:07,433
You had excellent teamwork.

1562
01:25:07,664 --> 01:25:11,463
Meanwhile, we've always thought...

1563
01:25:11,463 --> 01:25:15,144
Haram, Yeram, and Nizi are the best dancers...

1564
01:25:15,144 --> 01:25:18,644
when it comes to powerful moves.

1565
01:25:18,644 --> 01:25:22,513
But after watching this performance, one person is added to the list.

1566
01:25:22,713 --> 01:25:27,284
I believe she probably caught more attention.

1567
01:25:27,454 --> 01:25:30,223
I'm talking about Narumi.

1568
01:25:30,223 --> 01:25:32,623
(Narumi)

1569
01:25:32,623 --> 01:25:34,654
While singing,

1570
01:25:34,654 --> 01:25:37,394
she danced beautifully and powerfully.

1571
01:25:37,423 --> 01:25:39,933
And her facial expressions...

1572
01:25:39,933 --> 01:25:43,034
made it all look much better.

1573
01:25:43,164 --> 01:25:44,904
- Thank you. - Thank you for a great performance.

1574
01:25:45,404 --> 01:25:48,204
I think Narumi is the star of the day.

1575
01:25:48,704 --> 01:25:51,604
You showed expressions I hadn't seen before.

1576
01:25:51,604 --> 01:25:54,144
Also, your new hairstyle.

1577
01:25:54,314 --> 01:25:56,043
You look so much better.

1578
01:25:57,484 --> 01:25:59,454
The bangs do look good on her.

1579
01:26:00,284 --> 01:26:02,154
Now, Nizi.

1580
01:26:02,324 --> 01:26:05,053
Even though you're so young,

1581
01:26:05,923 --> 01:26:08,053
you're so alluring.

1582
01:26:08,053 --> 01:26:11,463
It's just amazing that you can be alluring at such a young age.

1583
01:26:11,463 --> 01:26:14,633
It's not easy to be charismatic and alluring at the same time,

1584
01:26:14,633 --> 01:26:16,003
especially at your age.

1585
01:26:16,003 --> 01:26:18,404
I must say, the person...

1586
01:26:18,404 --> 01:26:22,104
who captured my heart the most today was Nizi.

1587
01:26:22,343 --> 01:26:25,043
And the person who felt like the biggest rediscovery...

1588
01:26:25,043 --> 01:26:26,444
was Narumi.

1589
01:26:27,173 --> 01:26:28,814
Today,

1590
01:26:28,883 --> 01:26:31,854
you expressed yourself freely onstage, Narumi.

1591
01:26:31,854 --> 01:26:33,883
You pulled off the performance very well.

1592
01:26:34,114 --> 01:26:38,553
Because of that, I was happy to see a new side of you.

1593
01:26:38,553 --> 01:26:39,753
Thank you.

1594
01:26:41,253 --> 01:26:43,423
What did the producers think?

1595
01:26:43,963 --> 01:26:47,433
The original song is hard to perform as it is.

1596
01:26:47,433 --> 01:26:48,433
But...

1597
01:26:49,104 --> 01:26:52,003
since this was Performance Unit, we put more energy into the stage.

1598
01:26:52,133 --> 01:26:55,503
So I think even ITZY members will be satisfied...

1599
01:26:55,503 --> 01:26:58,843
with the performance.

1600
01:26:59,414 --> 01:27:01,173
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1601
01:27:02,244 --> 01:27:03,914
How will the judges pick among them?

1602
01:27:04,883 --> 01:27:06,183
Thank you for your hard work.

1603
01:27:06,454 --> 01:27:07,654
They did an amazing job.

1604
01:27:09,484 --> 01:27:12,324
(It's time to decide who will be promoted.)

1605
01:27:12,324 --> 01:27:13,324
It was cool.

1606
01:27:14,194 --> 01:27:15,623
They nailed the performance.

1607
01:27:15,623 --> 01:27:18,324
Even though Nizi was in the back, she caught my eyes.

1608
01:27:18,324 --> 01:27:19,333
Right?

1609
01:27:19,333 --> 01:27:22,433
But I talk about Nizi every time she takes the stage,

1610
01:27:22,433 --> 01:27:24,303
so I am trying to tone it down.

1611
01:27:25,204 --> 01:27:26,404
What should we do?

1612
01:27:27,373 --> 01:27:29,144
Everyone did well. Seriously.

1613
01:27:29,973 --> 01:27:32,013
Should I pick Narumi, Nizi,

1614
01:27:32,373 --> 01:27:33,513
or Jayla?

1615
01:27:33,513 --> 01:27:34,574
(They continue to ponder since all the members excelled.)

1616
01:27:34,574 --> 01:27:35,683
What should I do?

1617
01:27:35,683 --> 01:27:38,083
In terms of performance, I think we should pick...

1618
01:27:38,083 --> 01:27:40,284
among the three members,

1619
01:27:40,284 --> 01:27:41,954
Narumi, Nizi, and Bae Yeram.

1620
01:27:42,154 --> 01:27:44,053
- I agree. - I agree.

1621
01:27:44,053 --> 01:27:47,494
But I personally thought the Bae sisters didn't stand out.

1622
01:27:47,494 --> 01:27:49,694
- I see. - It was unexpected.

1623
01:27:50,064 --> 01:27:52,963
Perhaps I expected too much from them.

1624
01:27:53,133 --> 01:27:55,963
My choices are Narumi and Nizi.

1625
01:27:55,963 --> 01:27:57,003
I see.

1626
01:27:57,234 --> 01:27:59,074
My choices are Narumi and Nizi too.

1627
01:28:00,034 --> 01:28:01,404
I am so excited about their results.

1628
01:28:01,404 --> 01:28:02,744
I think it will be Narumi.

1629
01:28:02,744 --> 01:28:03,843
- Same here. - Seriously.

1630
01:28:07,244 --> 01:28:10,244
Performance Unit, please come up to the stage.

1631
01:28:11,144 --> 01:28:12,183
Let's go.

1632
01:28:13,854 --> 01:28:17,354
(Universe Ticket)

1633
01:28:18,793 --> 01:28:21,053
You should move a bit to the side. There you go.

1634
01:28:21,053 --> 01:28:22,064
All right.

1635
01:28:23,164 --> 01:28:24,194
All right.

1636
01:28:25,194 --> 01:28:28,064
I will announce one member of Performance Unit...

1637
01:28:28,433 --> 01:28:30,664
who will be promoted...

1638
01:28:30,664 --> 01:28:32,133
through Unicorn Ticketing.

1639
01:28:37,574 --> 01:28:40,843
We were very torn between the two members.

1640
01:28:43,183 --> 01:28:44,244
Firstly,

1641
01:28:44,944 --> 01:28:46,083
Nizi...

1642
01:28:47,053 --> 01:28:48,414
and Narumi,

1643
01:28:48,683 --> 01:28:51,683
please take a step forward.

1644
01:29:00,734 --> 01:29:06,104
Nizi, despite being only 13 years old,

1645
01:29:06,274 --> 01:29:08,333
the way you move your body is extraordinary.

1646
01:29:08,333 --> 01:29:09,873
- Truly extraordinary. - When you dance,

1647
01:29:10,074 --> 01:29:11,204
I think,

1648
01:29:11,803 --> 01:29:14,074
"She has an exceptional talent in dancing."

1649
01:29:14,074 --> 01:29:15,914
"She knows how to move her body."

1650
01:29:16,114 --> 01:29:19,314
"She has an incredible sense of rhythm."

1651
01:29:19,314 --> 01:29:20,683
You have such dance skills.

1652
01:29:20,784 --> 01:29:22,753
Thank you.

1653
01:29:23,683 --> 01:29:26,123
And Narumi,

1654
01:29:26,423 --> 01:29:29,593
you used your long arms and legs well...

1655
01:29:29,593 --> 01:29:31,933
and danced in a way to make them stand out.

1656
01:29:32,093 --> 01:29:37,234
Your charismatic facial expressions were quite memorable.

1657
01:29:37,404 --> 01:29:38,704
Okay. Thank you.

1658
01:29:40,234 --> 01:29:42,444
The promoted member of Performance Unit is...

1659
01:29:43,503 --> 01:29:44,973
I feel nervous.

1660
01:29:50,043 --> 01:29:52,914
(To be continued)

1661
01:29:55,365 --> 01:29:59,136
(Which member of Performance Unit will be promoted?)

1662
01:30:01,014 --> 01:30:02,315
It's Narumi.

1663
01:30:02,554 --> 01:30:04,285
(In the Performance Unit, Narumi wins the promotion.)

1664
01:30:04,285 --> 01:30:05,424
Thank you.

1665
01:30:05,724 --> 01:30:07,254
Narumi...

1666
01:30:07,895 --> 01:30:10,224
has been promoted to Level I.

1667
01:30:10,224 --> 01:30:12,325
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

1668
01:30:12,624 --> 01:30:13,735
Congratulations.

1669
01:30:14,365 --> 01:30:16,334
Thank you for your hard work.

1670
01:30:16,334 --> 01:30:18,634
- Thank you for your hard work. - Thank you.

1671
01:30:19,705 --> 01:30:22,804
To be honest, I want to watch the performance of "LOCO" again.

1672
01:30:22,804 --> 01:30:23,874
- Same here. - Same here.

1673
01:30:23,874 --> 01:30:26,174
- It was so cool. - Everyone did well.

1674
01:30:29,245 --> 01:30:32,915
The Position Unit performances of the Unit Station are over.

1675
01:30:33,315 --> 01:30:36,525
Today, three promoted members took one step closer...

1676
01:30:36,525 --> 01:30:38,424
to Level PRISM.

1677
01:30:39,054 --> 01:30:40,955
Kotoko and Narumi.

1678
01:30:40,955 --> 01:30:43,764
(Level I: Kotoko and Narumi)

1679
01:30:44,365 --> 01:30:45,395
Lim Seowon.

1680
01:30:45,395 --> 01:30:47,634
(Level R: Lim Seowon)

1681
01:30:47,634 --> 01:30:49,804
Three promoted members, congratulations.

1682
01:30:49,804 --> 01:30:53,535
(Level R: Lim Seowon)

1683
01:30:53,974 --> 01:30:55,275
Road to PRISM.

1684
01:30:55,275 --> 01:30:57,445
We will begin the New Song Unit.

1685
01:30:58,044 --> 01:31:00,315
The eliminated members of the New Song Unit...

1686
01:31:00,315 --> 01:31:02,575
won't be chosen solely by the Unicorns.

1687
01:31:02,815 --> 01:31:03,815
- What? - What?

1688
01:31:03,815 --> 01:31:04,815
What?

1689
01:31:04,815 --> 01:31:07,985
They will be chosen by the members of other units.

1690
01:31:07,985 --> 01:31:09,014
- What? - What?

1691
01:31:09,214 --> 01:31:10,285
What?

1692
01:31:10,554 --> 01:31:11,624
No way.

1693
01:31:12,025 --> 01:31:13,025
My goodness.

1694
01:31:13,224 --> 01:31:14,624
It was scary.

1695
01:31:14,624 --> 01:31:16,124
I really didn't expect it.

1696
01:31:17,424 --> 01:31:21,695
(The last unit performances that will determine the girls' fate)

1697
01:31:23,535 --> 01:31:27,775
(The girls become stronger at the crossroads of elimination.)

1698
01:31:27,775 --> 01:31:29,474
Whom should we pick this time?

1699
01:31:29,974 --> 01:31:34,275
(They must pick the members to be eliminated.)

1700
01:31:37,315 --> 01:31:43,224
(They can't avoid the time of decision.)

1701
01:31:44,155 --> 01:31:46,254
(My goodness)

1702
01:31:46,254 --> 01:31:47,325
I don't know what to do.

1703
01:31:48,655 --> 01:31:53,495
(The vote that will change their fate begins.)

1704
01:31:53,495 --> 01:31:55,764
My vote might send...

1705
01:31:55,764 --> 01:31:57,634
someone home.

1706
01:31:58,004 --> 01:32:00,405
The contestant I chose is...

1707
01:32:02,535 --> 01:32:03,645
It's this contestant.

1708
01:32:04,874 --> 01:32:06,105
Let's check out...

1709
01:32:06,105 --> 01:32:08,775
the elimination candidates that were chosen by the contestants.

1710
01:32:11,445 --> 01:32:13,754
(Which girl will leave the Universe?)

1711
01:32:14,084 --> 01:32:15,915
(And...)

1712
01:32:15,915 --> 01:32:18,785
(the 2nd Promotion Ceremony will take place next week.)

1713
01:32:19,684 --> 01:32:21,525
The dream ticketing for the debut.

1714
01:32:22,054 --> 01:32:24,365
Vote for your favorite girl.

1715
01:32:25,264 --> 01:32:28,464
Participate now on the Universe Ticket homepage...

1716

and Fancast app for the global vote, Fan Ticketing.

1717
01:32:33,334 --> 01:32:34,874
For the fourth Fan Ticketing,

1718
01:32:35,075 --> 01:32:38,474
you can cast up to 4 tickets to 1 girl.

1719
01:32:38,874 --> 01:32:41,014
Make sure to reserve a ticket for the girls' dreams.

1720
01:32:41,014 --> 01:32:42,775
(Recruiting audience members for the final live broadcast)

1721
01:32:42,775 --> 01:32:44,584
(At SBS Prism Tower in Sangam on Wednesday, January 17)

1722
01:32:44,584 --> 01:32:46,615
(Universe Ticket)

1723
01:32:46,615 --> 01:32:48,355
(Episode 9 will be revealed at 10:40pm, January 10.)
