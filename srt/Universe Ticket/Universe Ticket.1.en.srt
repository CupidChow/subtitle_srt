31
00:02:02,473 --> 00:02:03,571
Hello.

32
00:02:03,572 --> 00:02:05,871
I'm a girl with four different charms.

33
00:02:05,872 --> 00:02:07,511
I'm 15-year-old Hwang Sieun.

34
00:02:07,512 --> 00:02:10,211
When I was young, I was a kid model.

35
00:02:10,212 --> 00:02:11,981
(When she was 8 years old)

36
00:02:11,982 --> 00:02:13,552
After experiencing that,

37
00:02:13,553 --> 00:02:16,282
I became interested in the entertainment industry.

38
00:02:16,283 --> 00:02:18,753
I showed interest in becoming an idol.

39
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:21,522
I think that's how I got into it more.

40
00:02:21,523 --> 00:02:25,192
(When she was 8 years old)

I love singing and dancing.

44
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:39,411
You can become an idol singer in Korea.

45
00:02:39,412 --> 00:02:40,412
But...

46
00:02:40,573 --> 00:02:46,181
in Canada, you can only become a solo or band singer.

47
00:02:46,182 --> 00:02:47,211
(When she was 10 years old)

48
00:02:47,212 --> 00:02:50,222
I wanted to become an idol singer.

49
00:02:50,483 --> 00:02:52,393
That's why I came to Korea.

50
00:02:53,393 --> 00:02:54,651
I'm 14 years old.

51
00:02:54,652 --> 00:02:57,323

52
00:02:57,863 --> 00:02:59,863

00:03:34,532 --> 00:03:37,562

65
00:03:38,002 --> 00:03:39,472

Filipinos love K-pop.

97

Communities are born out of idols under K-pop.

98
00:05:24,672 --> 00:05:25,813
Like their love for them.

99
00:05:26,112 --> 00:05:28,742
It's my dream being here. Hopefully, I can bring...

100
00:05:28,743 --> 00:05:30,982
pride and joy to my fellow Filipinos.

Gosh, I'm so nervous. What do I do?

This is so international.

- Yes. It's like really... - I've never seen...

122

- A survival show. - a show like this.

Yes.

124
00:06:39,782 --> 00:06:42,482
(82 girls from around the world have gathered with their dreams.)

125
00:06:42,722 --> 00:06:44,183

This one?

127
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:48,792
- Hi. - Hi.

128
00:06:48,823 --> 00:06:50,023
All three of us will do it.

129
00:06:51,162 --> 00:06:54,993
Isn't she Kwon Eunchae?

130
00:06:55,263 --> 00:06:57,101
- Kwon Chaewon? I think... - Kwon Chaewon?

131
00:06:57,102 --> 00:06:59,801
Yes. She was a DIA member.

132
00:06:59,802 --> 00:07:00,873
- Yes. - I think.

133
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:04,471
She's a celebrity so it's fascinating.

134
00:07:04,472 --> 00:07:06,812
She already made her debut.

135
00:07:06,813 --> 00:07:09,183
I was so curious how good she would be.

136
00:07:09,482 --> 00:07:11,981
Hello. I'm a girl with a positive mindset...

137
00:07:11,982 --> 00:07:13,611
and bright energy.

138
00:07:13,612 --> 00:07:15,412
I'm the lovely Kwon Chaewon.

139
00:07:16,253 --> 00:07:19,351
(She performed with the name Kwon Eunchae in DIA.)

140
00:07:19,352 --> 00:07:21,552
As a member of DIA,

141
00:07:21,652 --> 00:07:23,763
I wasn't able to show a lot.

142
00:07:23,893 --> 00:07:27,862
Out of the seven years, I wasn't able to show half of myself.

143
00:07:28,232 --> 00:07:31,032
I never had that chance.

144
00:07:31,263 --> 00:07:32,532
Seriously.

145
00:07:34,032 --> 00:07:35,472
I really want to do this.

146
00:07:35,902 --> 00:07:40,013
I love singing and dancing.

147
00:07:41,573 --> 00:07:43,942
I want to get back on stage.

148
00:07:43,943 --> 00:07:45,782
(I want to get back on stage.)

149
00:07:49,323 --> 00:07:52,282
All 82 global girls, welcome.

150
00:07:52,753 --> 00:07:53,822
What do I do?

151
00:07:53,823 --> 00:07:55,222
My heart is pounding like crazy.

152
00:07:55,393 --> 00:07:57,263
- This is the real beginning. - This is the start.

153
00:07:58,563 --> 00:07:59,961
I'm so nervous.

154
00:07:59,962 --> 00:08:03,601
In the global girl group project, Universe Ticket,

155
00:08:03,602 --> 00:08:07,801
only eight of you can make your debut.

156
00:08:07,802 --> 00:08:09,032
(Only 8 debut members)

157
00:08:09,302 --> 00:08:10,503
Just eight.

158
00:08:11,443 --> 00:08:13,841
Who will make that debut dream come true?

159
00:08:13,842 --> 00:08:15,072
Oh, my gosh.

160
00:08:15,073 --> 00:08:17,513
- Gosh. - I'm scared.

161
00:08:17,683 --> 00:08:19,453
I'm getting the chills already.

162
00:08:23,323 --> 00:08:25,281
- Battle? - Battle Week?

163
00:08:25,282 --> 00:08:26,393
Battle Week?

164
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:29,052
The 7-day Battle Week will start today.

165
00:08:29,462 --> 00:08:30,862
After two battles,

166
00:08:31,222 --> 00:08:33,662
half of 82 girls will be eliminated.

167
00:08:33,893 --> 00:08:35,732
Just 41 girls will survive.

168
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,333
What?

169
00:08:45,973 --> 00:08:47,013
Half?

170
00:08:48,113 --> 00:08:51,942
That means half of this section will disappear.

171
00:08:52,383 --> 00:08:55,513
- Gosh. - That's harsh.

172
00:08:55,652 --> 00:08:56,882
I immediately thought...

173
00:08:56,883 --> 00:09:00,192
I didn't want to be in the half that gets eliminated.

174
00:09:00,452 --> 00:09:02,592
I knew that elimination happens...

175
00:09:02,593 --> 00:09:04,292
because it's a survival show.

176
00:09:04,422 --> 00:09:06,733
But I will try my best to stay.

177
00:09:06,893 --> 00:09:10,431
I could feel the start of a true competition.

178
00:09:10,432 --> 00:09:12,202
That really motivated me to do better.

179
00:09:13,402 --> 00:09:16,872
Universe Ticket's Battle Week. The first battle.

180
00:09:16,873 --> 00:09:17,973
I feel nervous.

181
00:09:18,202 --> 00:09:19,373
I feel really nervous.

182
00:09:19,912 --> 00:09:22,273
It's the 1-on-1 Battle.

183
00:09:22,713 --> 00:09:23,743
It's 1-on-1?

184
00:09:24,213 --> 00:09:25,213
No way.

185
00:09:25,214 --> 00:09:27,781
- It's 1-on-1? - It's 1-on-1?

186
00:09:27,782 --> 00:09:28,883
Right from the start?

187
00:09:29,452 --> 00:09:32,253
What do we do?

188
00:09:35,192 --> 00:09:38,362
Here are the 1-on-1 Battle rules. With the results of...

189
00:09:38,363 --> 00:09:41,593
the Profile Pre-Voting, the 1st to 41st rankers...

190
00:09:41,863 --> 00:09:45,702
will choose 1 out of the 42nd to 82nd rankers...

191
00:09:45,863 --> 00:09:47,733
for a battle.

192
00:09:48,802 --> 00:09:51,973
Gosh. That's harsh.

193
00:09:52,643 --> 00:09:54,713
It was really scary.

194
00:09:55,113 --> 00:09:58,113
I had no idea who I would go against.

195
00:09:58,483 --> 00:10:02,051
I already braced myself beforehand.

196
00:10:02,052 --> 00:10:03,422
I'm not afraid.

197
00:10:04,983 --> 00:10:07,822
Will you be a top ranker?

198
00:10:08,723 --> 00:10:09,822
Or a low ranker?

199
00:10:11,162 --> 00:10:15,332
I was very nervous and anxious.

200
00:10:15,432 --> 00:10:19,572
I really wanted to be in the top 41.

201
00:10:20,332 --> 00:10:23,342
Now, the 82 ranks of the Profile Pre-Voting...

202
00:10:23,343 --> 00:10:26,442
will be revealed.

203
00:10:28,042 --> 00:10:30,382
(The top rankers hold a big advantage in survival.)

204
00:10:30,383 --> 00:10:31,613
I'm so nervous.

205
00:10:33,483 --> 00:10:35,513
I'm scared.

206
00:10:36,483 --> 00:10:38,023
This is too fast.

207
00:10:38,322 --> 00:10:42,763
I never expected the 1-on-1 Battle.

208
00:10:43,593 --> 00:10:45,822
(The first contestant to find out her rank)

209
00:10:45,922 --> 00:10:47,263
(Lim Seowon, Korea)

210
00:10:51,062 --> 00:10:52,233
She must feel nervous.

211
00:10:57,702 --> 00:10:59,201
(Lim Seowon, Korea)

212
00:10:59,202 --> 00:11:01,642
(A girl who rather looks confident with her walk)

213
00:11:01,643 --> 00:11:03,613
- She's cute. - She's so cute.

214
00:11:04,782 --> 00:11:07,013
- She was the trot singer. - She appeared out of nowhere.

215
00:11:07,253 --> 00:11:09,352
- Right. - She was that baby.

216
00:11:09,353 --> 00:11:11,483
- She's so cute. - She's so cute.

217
00:11:12,322 --> 00:11:13,352
Hello.

218
00:11:13,353 --> 00:11:15,651
I'm a girl with unique talent and energy.

219
00:11:15,652 --> 00:11:17,463
I'm Lim Seowon.

220
00:11:19,093 --> 00:11:22,662
(Lim Seowon got a lot of attention as the trot prodigy.)

221
00:11:24,003 --> 00:11:25,062
The celebrity.

222
00:11:26,003 --> 00:11:27,003
I'm curious.

223
00:11:28,003 --> 00:11:30,302
I think she'll be in first place.

224
00:11:31,473 --> 00:11:34,373
- She might be in first place. - Right.

225
00:11:37,513 --> 00:11:39,042
She must be a top ranker.

226
00:11:40,483 --> 00:11:41,853
(Lim Seowon, Korea)

227
00:11:45,753 --> 00:11:47,093
She's in the top 10!

228
00:11:50,893 --> 00:11:54,092
(9th, Korea, Lim Seowon)

229
00:11:54,093 --> 00:11:56,963
That's really high. She's 9th out of 82 people.

230
00:11:57,402 --> 00:11:59,363
I was really surprised to see that I was in the top 10.

231
00:11:59,633 --> 00:12:02,233
I felt really grateful.

232
00:12:03,072 --> 00:12:04,801
That's really high.

233
00:12:04,802 --> 00:12:07,273
But that's still not a debut rank.

234
00:12:07,412 --> 00:12:08,713
You're right.

235
00:12:09,743 --> 00:12:11,412
(Anxin, China)

236
00:12:17,383 --> 00:12:18,852
She must have a high rank.

237
00:12:18,853 --> 00:12:20,123
You're right.

238
00:12:20,353 --> 00:12:22,552
Isn't that her? With the elephant...

239
00:12:22,822 --> 00:12:24,723
I think that's her.

240
00:12:25,062 --> 00:12:27,392
Hello. I'm Hani.

241
00:12:27,393 --> 00:12:28,393
(Her pet elephant, Jinjin)

242
00:12:28,394 --> 00:12:32,831
I joined this program to show more people who I am...

243
00:12:32,832 --> 00:12:37,873
and to share our people's culture with others around the world.

244
00:12:39,103 --> 00:12:41,942
(Her "Flower" by JISOO cover with her traditional dress...)

245
00:12:42,213 --> 00:12:45,412
(got over 5 million views!)

246
00:12:46,452 --> 00:12:49,311
(Now, the whole world is paying attention to her.)

247
00:12:49,312 --> 00:12:50,483
She's a famous person.

248
00:12:51,952 --> 00:12:54,223
She must be in first place.

249
00:12:56,162 --> 00:12:59,862
I was really excited and expectant.

250
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:02,863
(Anxin, China)

251
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:07,603
That's a really high rank.

252
00:13:08,733 --> 00:13:09,742
How cute.

253
00:13:09,743 --> 00:13:11,473
She got it like this.

254
00:13:13,572 --> 00:13:16,542
- That's her. - PRIKIL.

255
00:13:17,143 --> 00:13:18,513
It's Nana.

256
00:13:19,082 --> 00:13:22,411
- You're a Japanese idol singer. - Yes. Thank you.

257
00:13:22,412 --> 00:13:24,682
(The Korean contestants know who these two are.)

258
00:13:27,692 --> 00:13:30,822
(Current idol singers, PRIKIL's Nana and Yukino)

259
00:13:31,023 --> 00:13:34,331
I was always interested in performing in Korea.

260
00:13:34,332 --> 00:13:39,202
I wanted to realize my dream of becoming a global artist.

261
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:41,402
(Universe Ticket)

262
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:42,973
(Nana, Japan)

263
00:13:43,202 --> 00:13:44,643
It's Nana.

264
00:13:45,042 --> 00:13:46,071
Good luck!

265
00:13:46,072 --> 00:13:47,242
(What rank will Nana be in as a current idol singer?)

266
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:50,243
- Good luck, Nana! - Good luck!

267
00:13:52,143 --> 00:13:54,582
She must be in a top rank.

268
00:13:55,052 --> 00:13:56,483
She really feels like an idol.

269
00:13:57,052 --> 00:14:00,893
She's a really popular idol in Japan.

270
00:14:02,723 --> 00:14:07,892
I've watched "Who is Princess?" and saw how well she did.

271
00:14:07,893 --> 00:14:10,463
I expected her to be in first place.

272
00:14:10,763 --> 00:14:13,672
She already felt like a girl group member.

273
00:14:14,873 --> 00:14:16,172
(Nana, Japan)

274
00:14:18,973 --> 00:14:22,112
It wasn't really a low rank, but it was unexpected.

275
00:14:22,113 --> 00:14:23,713
I thought she would be in first place.

276
00:14:25,513 --> 00:14:26,752
Thank you.

277
00:14:26,753 --> 00:14:28,951
(19th, Japan, Nana)

278
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:31,651
Only the top eight can make the debut.

279
00:14:31,652 --> 00:14:34,822
I can't be satisfied with this rank.

280
00:14:35,452 --> 00:14:37,222
Yukino must be in first place.

281
00:14:37,223 --> 00:14:40,662
- She must be in 1st place. - She must be in 1st place.

282
00:14:41,963 --> 00:14:46,133
(The contestants expect Yukino to be in a high rank.)

283
00:14:46,202 --> 00:14:47,302
Let's go!

284
00:14:48,332 --> 00:14:52,973
I thought Yukino would be in first place.

285
00:14:56,942 --> 00:14:57,983
Really?

286
00:14:59,182 --> 00:15:00,182
(Yukino, Japan)

287
00:15:06,123 --> 00:15:10,662
(There's a 54-rank gap between her and Nana.)

288
00:15:11,322 --> 00:15:13,792
Seriously? No way.

289
00:15:15,032 --> 00:15:20,072
I thought Yukino would get a higher rank than that.

290
00:15:21,032 --> 00:15:25,373
(73rd, Japan, Yukino)

291
00:15:28,542 --> 00:15:32,681
I was upset that I always had to...

292
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:34,952
fall behind Nana.

293
00:15:34,983 --> 00:15:40,093
I want to work harder and compete with her again...

294
00:15:40,493 --> 00:15:43,993
when I finally catch up to her level.

295
00:15:44,623 --> 00:15:45,762
Gosh, this is serious.

296
00:15:45,763 --> 00:15:47,292
It's okay.

297
00:15:48,562 --> 00:15:49,733
Are you writing the word that means human on your hand?

298
00:15:50,302 --> 00:15:51,603
In Japan, people believe...

299
00:15:51,902 --> 00:15:56,233
writing the word that means human on your hand...

300
00:15:56,603 --> 00:16:02,312
and eating it helps you relax.

301
00:16:05,983 --> 00:16:07,811
Is she writing something down and eating it?

302
00:16:07,812 --> 00:16:08,982
That's adorable.

303
00:16:08,983 --> 00:16:09,983
She's like a little chick.

304
00:16:09,984 --> 00:16:12,253
She's doing that from her heart.

305
00:16:13,952 --> 00:16:15,353
(Kotoko)

306
00:16:20,093 --> 00:16:21,732
(18th, Japan, Kotoko)

307
00:16:21,733 --> 00:16:22,832
That's great.

308
00:16:23,503 --> 00:16:24,733
I'm jealous.

309
00:16:25,463 --> 00:16:28,072
She's so lovely. What do we do?

310
00:16:29,202 --> 00:16:30,843
Gehlee.

311
00:16:30,902 --> 00:16:32,402
She's a model.

312
00:16:35,213 --> 00:16:37,143
- You're pretty. - You look great.

313
00:16:37,182 --> 00:16:39,081
I'm Gehlee Dangca.

314
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:40,181
I'm 15 years old.

315
00:16:40,182 --> 00:16:42,912
And I'm from the Philippines.

316
00:16:43,853 --> 00:16:45,222
She's so pretty.

317
00:16:45,223 --> 00:16:47,652
(She's got the charm that catches everyone's eyes.)

318
00:16:48,952 --> 00:16:50,362
She's like a princess.

319
00:16:50,363 --> 00:16:51,692
She's so pretty.

320
00:16:52,623 --> 00:16:53,993
I thought she was a doll.

321
00:16:57,302 --> 00:16:59,632
(22nd, the Philippines, Gehlee Dangca)

322
00:16:59,633 --> 00:17:01,733
- She's so attractive. - Philippines.

323
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:04,442
I love you.

324
00:17:05,402 --> 00:17:07,812
We're losing more spots in the high ranks. What do we do?

325
00:17:09,143 --> 00:17:10,243
We should pray.

326
00:17:10,513 --> 00:17:13,713
The participants who came up first ranked high,

327
00:17:13,853 --> 00:17:17,282
but I wasn't up there, so I was very nervous.

328
00:17:18,253 --> 00:17:19,653
(Hwang Sieun)

329
00:17:24,122 --> 00:17:25,792
- She's the one from the teaser. - Right.

330
00:17:25,822 --> 00:17:27,792
She's the one with the sparkling eyes.

331
00:17:29,802 --> 00:17:30,862
You're pretty.

332
00:17:33,703 --> 00:17:34,802
She's cute.

333
00:17:35,273 --> 00:17:37,602
- It's like watching a celebrity. - I know.

334
00:17:37,903 --> 00:17:39,203
She's so pretty.

335
00:17:45,882 --> 00:17:47,013
(Hwang Sieun)

336
00:17:49,013 --> 00:17:50,182
Thank you.

337
00:17:50,183 --> 00:17:51,523
She's in the top eight.

338
00:17:54,092 --> 00:17:55,322
I'm very satisfied.

339
00:17:55,352 --> 00:17:57,621
I think it would be better...

340
00:17:57,622 --> 00:18:00,331
to pick my opponent than to be picked.

341
00:18:00,332 --> 00:18:02,032
(5th, Korea, Hwang Sieun)

342
00:18:06,973 --> 00:18:10,202
(Kwon Chaewon)

343
00:18:10,203 --> 00:18:12,243
- She's here. - She's a fairy.

344
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:14,973
She's a member of DIA.

345
00:18:15,213 --> 00:18:18,081
She's got the vibes of a celebrity.

346
00:18:18,082 --> 00:18:19,342
I know.

347
00:18:19,953 --> 00:18:21,513
She's so cool.

348
00:18:22,913 --> 00:18:26,082
(Kwon Chaewon comes up with everyone's expectations.)

349
00:18:27,592 --> 00:18:29,453
- She's pretty. - So pretty.

350
00:18:29,592 --> 00:18:31,922
She must be under a lot of pressure though.

351
00:18:31,923 --> 00:18:33,562
She must feel pressured.

352
00:18:33,632 --> 00:18:34,993
She's under a lot of pressure.

353
00:18:35,193 --> 00:18:37,232
To be honest,

354
00:18:37,233 --> 00:18:39,132
I want to win first place.

355
00:18:49,013 --> 00:18:51,811
(2nd, Korea, Kwon Chaewon)

356
00:18:51,812 --> 00:18:53,612
That's amazing.

357
00:18:53,913 --> 00:18:54,913
Thank you.

358
00:18:54,914 --> 00:18:57,753
I'll work hard to prove myself.

359
00:18:57,822 --> 00:19:00,792
I think I can win the ticket.

360
00:19:01,592 --> 00:19:03,223
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

361
00:19:08,862 --> 00:19:11,102
Who on earth is in first place?

362
00:19:11,503 --> 00:19:12,862
Who's the first then?

363
00:19:13,273 --> 00:19:16,032
Who's first place? I'm so curious.

364
00:19:16,802 --> 00:19:18,172
Who's first place?

365
00:19:18,173 --> 00:19:19,403
(The ranks left are 1st and 42nd.)

366
00:19:19,503 --> 00:19:20,512
Oh, my gosh.

367
00:19:20,513 --> 00:19:21,743
(The remaining participants are Riel from Myanmar...)

368
00:19:22,173 --> 00:19:24,312
(and Jeon Jieun of Busters.)

369
00:19:26,612 --> 00:19:30,153
People do know the girl group called Busters.

370
00:19:30,683 --> 00:19:33,753
But I'd like them to know...

371
00:19:33,892 --> 00:19:36,993
my name, Jeon Jieun as well.

372
00:19:37,523 --> 00:19:39,463
She already made her debut,

373
00:19:39,723 --> 00:19:41,892
- so I bet she ranks high. - I think so.

374
00:19:42,733 --> 00:19:45,062
- I'm so nervous. - Who's number one?

375
00:19:45,263 --> 00:19:46,331
You?

376
00:19:46,332 --> 00:19:47,801
- One? - Three, two, one.

377
00:19:47,802 --> 00:19:49,332
No, it can't be me.

378
00:19:49,943 --> 00:19:53,871
My dream is to become a K-pop idol artist.

379
00:19:53,872 --> 00:19:56,782
I'm Riel from Myanmar.

380
00:19:59,913 --> 00:20:02,311
(Riel dreams of becoming a K-pop artist.)

381
00:20:02,312 --> 00:20:03,422
When did you come to Korea?

382
00:20:03,423 --> 00:20:05,482
I came here in 2018.

383
00:20:05,483 --> 00:20:07,723
Word-spacing is my concern.

384
00:20:08,223 --> 00:20:09,291
(Universe Ticket)

385
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:10,463
(Riel)

386
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:17,433
(If she takes 42nd place, she's in the lower ranks.)

387
00:20:18,663 --> 00:20:20,132
Could she be in first place?

388
00:20:22,302 --> 00:20:23,743
This is so cruel.

389
00:20:24,072 --> 00:20:25,102
This is so...

390
00:20:25,703 --> 00:20:26,773
She must be really nervous.

391
00:20:27,973 --> 00:20:32,012
There were only two ranks remaining,

392
00:20:32,013 --> 00:20:34,253
so I was really nervous.

393
00:20:34,612 --> 00:20:36,382
- She must be so nervous. - Right.

394
00:20:36,923 --> 00:20:38,153
Why am I feeling nervous?

395
00:20:38,882 --> 00:20:40,153
She must be nervous.

396
00:20:42,092 --> 00:20:46,763
(The 2 participants are at the crossroads of 1st and 42nd.)

397
00:20:51,403 --> 00:20:52,562
(Riel)

398
00:20:55,602 --> 00:20:58,601
(1st, Myanmar, Riel)

399
00:20:58,602 --> 00:21:00,013
That's great!

400
00:21:01,812 --> 00:21:03,512
She must be elated.

401
00:21:03,513 --> 00:21:04,812
(42nd, Korea, Jeon Jieun)

402
00:21:07,913 --> 00:21:09,582
I was really surprised.

403
00:21:10,223 --> 00:21:11,852
I have to do well.

404
00:21:13,082 --> 00:21:17,963
I can practice all night without sleep.

405
00:21:18,122 --> 00:21:21,292
I'll make sure to work hard and hold the top spot.

406
00:21:21,733 --> 00:21:22,861
(Profile Pre-Votilg Ranking)

407
00:21:22,862 --> 00:21:25,233
(1st: Riel, 2nd: Kwon Chaewon, 3rd: Vanesya. 4th: Vu Linh Dan)

408
00:21:25,263 --> 00:21:27,772
(5th, Hwang Sieun, 6th: Jin Hyeonju, 7th: Gabi, 8th: Lee Sunwoo)

409
00:21:27,773 --> 00:21:28,773
(9th: Lim Seowon, 10th: Aya Natsumi)

410
00:21:28,773 --> 00:21:29,773
(11th: Elisia, 12th: Alyssa, 13th: Kim Sumin)

411
00:21:29,774 --> 00:21:30,801
(14th: Anxin, 15th: Oh Daeun, )

412
00:21:30,802 --> 00:21:31,802
(16th: Heo Sunbin, 17th: Kwon Eunhyung, 18th: Kotoko)

413
00:21:31,803 --> 00:21:33,672
(19th: Nana, 20th: Enny, 21st: Kim Soyul)

414
00:21:33,673 --> 00:21:34,673
(29th: Minari, 30th: Lee Soovin, 31th: Bang Yunha, 32nd: Kim Hyojin)

415
00:21:34,673 --> 00:21:35,673
(33rd: Ahn Seungbi, 34th: Noh Yeonwoo, 35th: Mila)

416
00:21:35,674 --> 00:21:36,682
(36th: Jang Sua, 37th: Kim Chaea)

417
00:21:36,683 --> 00:21:37,743
(38th: Kim Chaewon, 39th: Kim Sujin, 40th, Lee Jine, 42th: Kim Yuri)

418
00:21:37,943 --> 00:21:39,041
It's finished.

419
00:21:39,042 --> 00:21:40,453
(7th, Canada, Gabi)

420
00:21:40,812 --> 00:21:42,213
I'm so jealous.

421
00:21:43,082 --> 00:21:47,222
I thought this was the real beginning.

422
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:49,121
It's not just evaluating individuals.

423
00:21:49,122 --> 00:21:51,592
I must be compared with someone.

424
00:21:51,693 --> 00:21:53,932
They will compare my talents...

425
00:21:53,933 --> 00:21:55,792
with the others'.

426
00:21:55,832 --> 00:21:58,233
I'll do my best to stay in the higher ranking.

427
00:21:58,602 --> 00:22:01,531
We have to survive. We really do.

428
00:22:01,532 --> 00:22:03,003
(21st, Korea, Kim Soyul, 36th, Korea, Jang Sua)

429
00:22:03,443 --> 00:22:07,013
The ranking is based on the voting, not on our abilities.

430
00:22:07,072 --> 00:22:08,912
Once I show you what I've got,

431
00:22:08,913 --> 00:22:10,682
things can change.

432
00:22:10,683 --> 00:22:14,352
If I'm in the lower ranks, that means I can go up.

433
00:22:14,453 --> 00:22:17,982
I want to prove that those who get picked...

434
00:22:17,983 --> 00:22:20,023
can do a better job.

435
00:22:22,253 --> 00:22:23,763
- What's this? - What's this?

436
00:22:24,523 --> 00:22:27,762
(The benefit for the participants in the higher ranks)

437
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:28,862
Cool.

438
00:22:28,963 --> 00:22:30,302
It says everything.

439
00:22:31,203 --> 00:22:33,473
It's the list of songs that those in the lower ranks sing.

440
00:22:33,532 --> 00:22:34,602
Gosh. Hang on.

441
00:22:35,302 --> 00:22:38,673
(Second, the practice video of the participants in the lower ranks)

442
00:22:40,312 --> 00:22:41,642
She's singing this song?

443
00:22:42,812 --> 00:22:45,483
There are a lot of participants who are pretty good.

444
00:22:46,082 --> 00:22:47,851
There are a lot of participants to check.

445
00:22:47,852 --> 00:22:48,912
(They have to find a participant whom they can defeat.)

446
00:22:48,913 --> 00:22:51,352
Watching them perform on stage,

447
00:22:51,423 --> 00:22:54,253
I thought I needed to do really well to survive.

448
00:22:54,653 --> 00:22:57,162
It looks fun. I think I can do this.

449
00:22:57,163 --> 00:22:59,792
Is there a participant whom you think you can defeat?

450
00:23:00,392 --> 00:23:02,031
There are a lot.

451
00:23:02,032 --> 00:23:03,392
(11th, the Philippines, Elisia)

452
00:23:04,862 --> 00:23:06,301
(52nd, Korea, Cho Minseo)

453
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:07,932
I was upset.

454
00:23:07,933 --> 00:23:10,872
I wish I could pick my opponent.

455
00:23:11,342 --> 00:23:13,812
And I was really jealous, to be honest.

456
00:23:14,243 --> 00:23:15,572
I'm the 49th.

457
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,082
Ta-da.

458
00:23:19,042 --> 00:23:21,811
I want to watch the video clips...

459
00:23:21,812 --> 00:23:24,822
- of other participants. - I want to watch them too.

460
00:23:25,582 --> 00:23:27,122
I want to pick too.

461
00:23:27,352 --> 00:23:29,153
They watched it a lot.

462
00:23:29,622 --> 00:23:31,963
Please. I don't want to go home.

463
00:23:32,523 --> 00:23:34,292
I don't want to be eliminated too soon.

464
00:23:34,592 --> 00:23:38,602
Getting eliminated in the first round is the last thing I want.

465
00:23:39,663 --> 00:23:43,302
(The high ranks start picking opponents for the 1-on-1 Battle.)

466
00:23:45,602 --> 00:23:48,212
(Who will the 5th Hwang Sieun pick?)

467
00:23:48,213 --> 00:23:49,372
I think...

468
00:23:49,413 --> 00:23:51,482
I'll pick someone younger than me.

469
00:23:51,483 --> 00:23:52,812
(5th, Korea, Hwang Sieun)

470
00:23:54,282 --> 00:23:57,923
If I go against someone I pick, I believe the odds are in my favor.

471
00:24:00,953 --> 00:24:02,822
I'm torn between two participants.

472
00:24:03,562 --> 00:24:06,322
(Yukino is in the same group with Nana, but she's a low rank.)

473
00:24:08,132 --> 00:24:12,601
Yukino has many attractive qualities,

474
00:24:12,602 --> 00:24:14,102
so she bothered me.

475
00:24:19,642 --> 00:24:21,812
I think I can probably beat her.

476
00:24:24,443 --> 00:24:27,312
Actually, I gave it a lot of thought.

477
00:24:28,852 --> 00:24:30,111
Chaewon is...

478
00:24:30,112 --> 00:24:31,222
(53rd, Japan, Narumi)

479
00:24:31,223 --> 00:24:35,392
the last one I want to compete with.

480
00:24:35,753 --> 00:24:38,762
She's got a certain aura.

481
00:24:38,763 --> 00:24:40,732
She already made her debut,

482
00:24:40,733 --> 00:24:44,932
so she must be talented.

483
00:24:44,933 --> 00:24:46,463
What if she picks you?

484
00:24:46,562 --> 00:24:47,673
Then...

485
00:24:47,733 --> 00:24:48,733
I'll cry.

486
00:24:48,734 --> 00:24:50,102
(I'll cry then.)

487
00:24:51,542 --> 00:24:53,242
I'm nervous, but...

488
00:24:53,243 --> 00:24:54,811
(Who will Kwon Chaewon pick when everyone wants to avoid her?)

489
00:24:54,812 --> 00:24:56,111
Thank you.

490
00:24:56,112 --> 00:24:58,443
(Who will Kwon Chaewon pick when everyone wants to avoid her?)

491
00:25:00,612 --> 00:25:01,652
Yu?

492
00:25:01,653 --> 00:25:03,882
Yu is my roommate.

493
00:25:04,552 --> 00:25:05,752
She's been nice to me.

494
00:25:05,753 --> 00:25:07,153
(9th, Korea, Lim Seowon)

495
00:25:07,223 --> 00:25:08,953
I have no other choice. I have to survive.

496
00:25:10,153 --> 00:25:13,223
(80th, Japan, Yu)

497
00:25:13,362 --> 00:25:15,892
I can't believe I'm the 80th.

498
00:25:16,292 --> 00:25:19,632
I can't say anything about that.

499
00:25:22,632 --> 00:25:24,673
I just wanted to enjoy my time here.

500
00:25:26,913 --> 00:25:27,943
Hi.

501
00:25:28,312 --> 00:25:31,213
I just finished choosing our...

502
00:25:32,183 --> 00:25:34,753
picks for the battle tomorrow.

503
00:25:37,122 --> 00:25:39,082
I'm very nervous.

504
00:25:40,453 --> 00:25:41,753
What if I lose?

505
00:25:42,493 --> 00:25:44,562
I think I picked the wrong one. What do I do?

506
00:25:44,792 --> 00:25:46,322
- That's not true. - What if...

507
00:25:46,862 --> 00:25:47,933
You can do this.

508
00:25:48,163 --> 00:25:50,361
If I make a mistake or something...

509
00:25:50,362 --> 00:25:51,463
Yes.

510
00:25:51,703 --> 00:25:53,463
I can't imagine.

511
00:25:55,233 --> 00:25:56,601
No. Don't say that.

512
00:25:56,602 --> 00:25:57,842
- Yes. - You're really good.

513
00:25:59,572 --> 00:26:01,871
I'll be really nervous in front of everyone.

514
00:26:01,872 --> 00:26:04,712
Right. I'm nervous when there are a lot of people.

515
00:26:04,713 --> 00:26:05,713
I know.

516
00:26:05,714 --> 00:26:07,452
It's okay. We can do this.

517
00:26:07,453 --> 00:26:08,683
Right. We can do it.

518
00:26:10,483 --> 00:26:12,082
The die is cast.

519
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,423
Yes.

520
00:26:18,362 --> 00:26:25,802
(The day of 1-on-1 Battle)

521
00:26:30,872 --> 00:26:31,903
I'm scared.

522
00:26:33,003 --> 00:26:34,413
- I'm nervous. - This is huge.

523
00:26:35,372 --> 00:26:36,641
- Are you nervous? - What?

524
00:26:36,642 --> 00:26:38,611
- Are you nervous? - Yes, I'm nervous.

525
00:26:38,612 --> 00:26:40,483
- I'm nervous. - I'm nervous.

526
00:26:42,513 --> 00:26:44,522
I'm really nervous.

527
00:26:44,523 --> 00:26:46,223
(60th, Japan, Nako)

528
00:26:46,852 --> 00:26:50,463
We will now start the first battle of Battle Week.

529
00:26:53,892 --> 00:26:55,962
(Universe Icon, All-rounder Unicorn, Kim Se Jeong)

530
00:26:55,963 --> 00:26:57,831
(Universe Icon, Artist Unicorn, Younha)

531
00:26:57,832 --> 00:26:59,631
(Universe Icon, Girl Group Unicorn, Hyoyeon)

532
00:26:59,632 --> 00:27:01,301
(Universe Icon, Performance Unicorn, Rian)

533
00:27:01,302 --> 00:27:02,802
(Universe Icon, Producer Unicorn, ADORA)

534
00:27:03,473 --> 00:27:05,402
Gosh, what do I do?

535
00:27:05,403 --> 00:27:07,243
I'm so nervous and shaking.

536
00:27:09,572 --> 00:27:13,042
(Universe Icon, Wannabe Unicorn, Chaeryeong and Yeji)

537
00:27:16,082 --> 00:27:18,621
The first battle of Universe Ticket Battle Week.

538
00:27:18,622 --> 00:27:20,551
We will begin 1-on-1 Battle.

539
00:27:20,552 --> 00:27:23,652
(1-on-1 Battle starts.)

540
00:27:23,653 --> 00:27:26,622
- Let's go. - Let's do this.

541
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:28,662
In 1-on-1 Battle,

542
00:27:28,663 --> 00:27:31,732
the high ranks will choose the low ranks for the battle.

543
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:32,932
The winner of the battle...

544
00:27:32,933 --> 00:27:35,172
will be determined by the votes of the five Unicorns.

545
00:27:35,173 --> 00:27:36,532
What do we do?

546
00:27:36,703 --> 00:27:38,442
How can I possibly sing in front of Younha?

547
00:27:38,443 --> 00:27:40,173
- How would I sing? - I know.

548
00:27:41,312 --> 00:27:45,142
I want to see their potential and support them.

549
00:27:45,342 --> 00:27:47,653
It's about knowing yourself.

550
00:27:48,013 --> 00:27:51,182
You need to show yourself on stage without saying anything.

551
00:27:51,183 --> 00:27:54,522
And you can show what you got only when you know yourself well.

552
00:27:54,523 --> 00:27:57,992
Of course, they have to sing and dance well.

553
00:27:57,993 --> 00:28:00,322
They also need to do some acting on stage.

554
00:28:00,562 --> 00:28:04,432
In the meantime, they need to show off their talent...

555
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:09,302
that catches my eye. I'll vote for those who can pull that off.

556
00:28:10,642 --> 00:28:11,801
The participants who win...

557
00:28:11,802 --> 00:28:14,472
will get the benefit for the final battle of Battle Week.

558
00:28:14,473 --> 00:28:16,212
(The participants who win will get the benefit...)

559
00:28:16,213 --> 00:28:17,381
(for the final battle of Battle Week.)

560
00:28:17,382 --> 00:28:20,683
Let's begin the first battle of Universe Ticket Battle Week.

561
00:28:21,082 --> 00:28:22,413
The fifth place, Hwang Sieun...

562
00:28:24,352 --> 00:28:25,382
She's pretty.

563
00:28:26,382 --> 00:28:28,523
And the 50th place, Choi Yeojin will have a battle.

564
00:28:30,822 --> 00:28:34,763
(5th Hwang Sieun versus 50th Choi Yeojin)

565
00:28:37,903 --> 00:28:40,031
- They're so pretty. - They're lovely.

566
00:28:40,032 --> 00:28:41,531
- I know. - Sieun is pretty.

567
00:28:41,532 --> 00:28:42,572
Right.

568
00:28:44,503 --> 00:28:47,072
What made you choose Choi Yeojin?

569
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:53,242
I think I should pick the weakest one...

570
00:28:53,243 --> 00:28:54,552
just to be safe.

571
00:28:55,312 --> 00:28:56,312
My gosh.

572
00:28:56,313 --> 00:28:59,822
(1-on-1 Battle D-1, looking over the low ranks)

573
00:29:01,292 --> 00:29:04,223
(The 1-on-1 Battle practice video of the 50th place, Choi Yeojin)

574
00:29:06,362 --> 00:29:09,392
Yeojin is still young,

575
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:13,763
so I could see that she still had a lot to improve.

576
00:29:14,733 --> 00:29:17,602
I'm afraid it will upset her a lot,

577
00:29:17,943 --> 00:29:20,443
but I have to win anyway.

578
00:29:21,372 --> 00:29:22,811
Who picked me?

579
00:29:22,812 --> 00:29:23,882
Hwang Sieun.

580
00:29:24,042 --> 00:29:25,442
Hwang Sieun picked you.

581
00:29:25,443 --> 00:29:26,683
- Okay. - My gosh.

582
00:29:27,183 --> 00:29:29,112
I'm so curious.

583
00:29:29,782 --> 00:29:31,023
Sieun...

584
00:29:31,622 --> 00:29:36,291
might think I was easy to deal with.

585
00:29:36,292 --> 00:29:38,562
That's what I thought.

586
00:29:39,392 --> 00:29:40,392
But...

587
00:29:40,832 --> 00:29:42,963
it's not like I'm bad.

588
00:29:44,332 --> 00:29:45,503
I'll win.

589
00:29:46,332 --> 00:29:47,632
Let's give it our best.

590
00:29:48,302 --> 00:29:50,331
I wanted to be friends with you.

591
00:29:50,332 --> 00:29:51,943
(50th, Korea, Choi Yeojin)

592
00:29:53,342 --> 00:29:54,773
Sieun is the fifth place,

593
00:29:55,273 --> 00:29:58,041
and Choi Yeojin is the 50th place.

594
00:29:58,042 --> 00:29:59,713
The difference is like ten times.

595
00:30:00,282 --> 00:30:01,382
Do you think you can turn the tables?

596
00:30:02,082 --> 00:30:03,412
I'm confident...

597
00:30:03,413 --> 00:30:07,493
that I can be ten times better than Sieun.

598
00:30:09,493 --> 00:30:10,523
That's nice.

599
00:30:10,792 --> 00:30:12,291
That's so cool.

600
00:30:12,292 --> 00:30:13,322
She's great.

601
00:30:13,792 --> 00:30:15,092
She's so adorable.

602
00:30:15,493 --> 00:30:17,463
- She sounds confident. - I know.

603
00:30:18,562 --> 00:30:19,963
That didn't bother me at all.

604
00:30:20,203 --> 00:30:22,802
I was just like, "Okay. I see."

605
00:30:23,673 --> 00:30:26,872
Then we will start with the high rank's performance.

606
00:30:37,298 --> 00:30:38,298
Oh, my gosh.

607
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:43,737
("Alone" by Coogie)

608
00:30:45,838 --> 00:30:46,907
What?

609
00:31:04,618 --> 00:31:05,957
(50th, Choi Yeo Jin)

610
00:31:08,957 --> 00:31:10,058
- She's so cool. - Nice.

611
00:31:29,308 --> 00:31:30,377
I got goosebumps.

612
00:31:32,217 --> 00:31:34,047
Thank you.

613
00:31:34,048 --> 00:31:35,788
- She seemed a little nervous. - Yes.

614
00:31:37,387 --> 00:31:39,318
She was really nervous.

615
00:31:39,858 --> 00:31:41,157
She could've been better.

616
00:31:41,887 --> 00:31:43,197
She's got a pretty voice.

617
00:31:43,758 --> 00:31:46,568
Next up is the low rank's performance.

618
00:31:47,627 --> 00:31:49,396
Sieun picked me,

619
00:31:49,397 --> 00:31:51,568
but I don't want to lose.

620
00:31:53,967 --> 00:31:55,607
She doesn't seem nervous at all.

621
00:31:55,608 --> 00:31:56,677
Right.

622
00:31:58,677 --> 00:32:03,318
("Smiley" by Choi Ye Na)

623
00:32:04,677 --> 00:32:05,947
She's so lovely.

624
00:32:13,558 --> 00:32:14,588
So cute.

625
00:32:17,298 --> 00:32:18,997
This is worth watching.

626
00:32:18,998 --> 00:32:20,028
She dances so well.

627
00:32:25,098 --> 00:32:26,437
She's so adorable.

628
00:32:46,058 --> 00:32:47,157
She's so good.

629
00:32:51,157 --> 00:32:52,157
She's so cute.

630
00:33:04,108 --> 00:33:05,477
She's good!

631
00:33:19,387 --> 00:33:20,626
Thank you.

632
00:33:20,627 --> 00:33:21,627
She's so cute.

633
00:33:22,187 --> 00:33:23,657
She's so talented.

634
00:33:23,927 --> 00:33:25,328
- She's energetic. - She's good.

635
00:33:26,227 --> 00:33:28,226
I can tell she practiced a lot.

636
00:33:28,227 --> 00:33:29,498
Right?

637
00:33:29,897 --> 00:33:31,967
We will start the vote.

638
00:33:33,538 --> 00:33:34,538
Right away?

639
00:33:34,708 --> 00:33:36,537
- Seriously... - This is nerve-racking.

640
00:33:36,538 --> 00:33:37,637
- They must be nervous. - I know.

641
00:33:38,107 --> 00:33:40,506
(The winner is determined by the vote of the 5 Unicorns.)

642
00:33:40,507 --> 00:33:41,977
I have no idea who will win.

643
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:43,547
They were totally different.

644
00:33:43,848 --> 00:33:45,518
All right. Show us...

645
00:33:45,878 --> 00:33:46,947
the battle result.

646
00:33:47,418 --> 00:33:49,518
- My gosh. - Right away?

647
00:33:50,257 --> 00:33:51,817
Their hearts must be pounding.

648
00:33:55,027 --> 00:33:57,296
I've worked hard,

649
00:33:57,297 --> 00:33:58,598
so I'll try to win.

650
00:33:58,898 --> 00:34:00,368
I'm confident that I can win.

651
00:34:01,398 --> 00:34:02,427
(Hwang Sieun 5th, Choi Yeojin 50th)

652
00:34:04,938 --> 00:34:08,136
(5th Hwang Sieun: 1, 50th Choi Yeojin: 4)

653
00:34:08,137 --> 00:34:09,137
Thank you.

654
00:34:12,038 --> 00:34:13,308
You did well, Sieun.

655
00:34:16,078 --> 00:34:19,177
Sieun, is there a reason why you sang and danced separately?

656
00:34:19,717 --> 00:34:23,518
I think I dance better than I sing,

657
00:34:23,688 --> 00:34:25,856
so I decided to do things separately...

658
00:34:25,857 --> 00:34:27,527
and focus more on dancing.

659
00:34:27,887 --> 00:34:30,827
I think it's important for you...

660
00:34:30,828 --> 00:34:34,397
to sing and dance well simultaneously in K-pop.

661
00:34:34,398 --> 00:34:36,997
And I think that's what Yeojin showed.

662
00:34:36,998 --> 00:34:39,498
Thank you both for your performances.

663
00:34:39,567 --> 00:34:40,938
Thank you.

664
00:34:41,737 --> 00:34:44,737
Gosh. This isn't easy.

665
00:34:45,478 --> 00:34:47,648
Oh, no. I'm so nervous. My heart is beating fast.

666
00:34:48,148 --> 00:34:49,717
My heart is beating like crazy.

667
00:34:50,217 --> 00:34:51,817
Oh, no. What am I going to do?

668
00:34:53,087 --> 00:34:55,188
We're ready for the next battle.

669
00:34:59,927 --> 00:35:00,927
What is it?

670
00:35:03,257 --> 00:35:05,227
- I guess she's some kind of a star. - Why are they so surprised?

671
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:07,327
- She must be quite popular. - I guess so.

672
00:35:07,328 --> 00:35:09,228
(Kotoko)

673
00:35:09,567 --> 00:35:10,768
So cute.

674
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,937
- The battle of two cuties. - So cute.

675
00:35:12,938 --> 00:35:14,368
Hello.

676
00:35:14,637 --> 00:35:17,406
- Hello. - So cute.

677
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:19,107
Gosh. They're so cute. Oh, my.

678
00:35:19,237 --> 00:35:20,447
You're adorable!

679
00:35:20,578 --> 00:35:23,148
Thank you.

680
00:35:25,317 --> 00:35:27,688
- She already made some fans here. - Right?

681
00:35:29,688 --> 00:35:31,257
Hello.

682
00:35:31,487 --> 00:35:33,526
I'd like to join Universe Ticket.

683
00:35:33,527 --> 00:35:38,527
So please support me for the ticket to my dream.

684
00:35:38,857 --> 00:35:40,268
Bye.

685
00:35:40,728 --> 00:35:42,498
The participant I want to be friends with?

686
00:35:43,237 --> 00:35:45,967
- The cute blonde. Yes, her. - Kotoko?

687
00:35:46,067 --> 00:35:50,507
The girl with the blonde hair was really adorable.

688
00:35:51,078 --> 00:35:53,307
I would pick Kotoko.

689
00:35:53,308 --> 00:35:54,808
Kotoko.

690
00:35:55,007 --> 00:35:56,176
Kotoko.

691
00:35:56,177 --> 00:35:57,747
Kotoko...

692
00:35:57,748 --> 00:36:00,947
I'd like to be friends with Kotoko.

693
00:36:01,447 --> 00:36:03,018
(She has become the mascot of Universe Ticket.)

694
00:36:03,157 --> 00:36:05,717
Everyone, move out of the way. I must take pictures with Kotoko.

695
00:36:06,087 --> 00:36:07,688
- I was here first. - No...

696
00:36:07,788 --> 00:36:10,828
- Let's take one together. - Should we take it together?

697
00:36:10,857 --> 00:36:13,796
- Together. - Let's take one together.

698
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:15,297
(Kotoko is always surrounded by her friends.)

699
00:36:17,067 --> 00:36:18,598
So cute.

700
00:36:19,907 --> 00:36:21,307
You're the cutest.

701
00:36:21,308 --> 00:36:24,606
I like making people happy.

702
00:36:24,607 --> 00:36:28,277
And I also like making them smile.

703
00:36:28,447 --> 00:36:32,647
I think I'll be able to bring smiles to the people...

704
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:34,248
who support me.

705
00:36:35,288 --> 00:36:37,557
Is there a participant you would like to go up against?

706
00:36:37,558 --> 00:36:39,058
- Fight. - Is there?

707
00:36:39,828 --> 00:36:42,027
I want to go up against a Japanese participant.

708
00:36:43,427 --> 00:36:44,527
Against a Japanese participant?

709
00:36:44,797 --> 00:36:46,027
Why not a Korean participant?

710
00:36:47,067 --> 00:36:50,597
They're good dancers, so that scares me.

711
00:36:50,598 --> 00:36:53,637
- I see. They're good dancers. - I see. Korean participants.

712
00:36:54,708 --> 00:36:56,808
The participant I want to battle against is...

713
00:36:58,208 --> 00:36:59,378
Yu.

714
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:06,077
In the beginning of her video, she was doing some sexy moves.

715
00:37:06,078 --> 00:37:10,288
Then I was surprised to see that she showed cute acts.

716
00:37:10,618 --> 00:37:14,356
I was going to use my cute acts during my performance too.

717
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:17,197
So I wanted to battle against her.

718
00:37:18,398 --> 00:37:20,828
You know how I feel?

719
00:37:21,128 --> 00:37:23,736
I don't feel ready at all.

720
00:37:23,737 --> 00:37:27,836
My dancing and singing aren't perfect at all.

721
00:37:27,837 --> 00:37:32,407
Things can get a bit too intense while singing. You know?

722
00:37:33,407 --> 00:37:39,987
I end up doing this. So my voice comes out all weird.

723
00:37:40,688 --> 00:37:45,458
I haven't had any proper dancing or singing lessons.

724
00:37:45,558 --> 00:37:48,127
So there's definitely some pressure.

725
00:37:48,128 --> 00:37:50,558
It made me think that I should work harder.

726
00:37:51,498 --> 00:37:56,197
(She kept practicing when she was with her friends.)

727
00:37:56,368 --> 00:37:57,667
(She was listening to her friends...)

728
00:37:57,668 --> 00:37:58,736
(while practicing at the same time.)

729
00:37:58,737 --> 00:38:00,038
- You're so cool. - You look beautiful.

730
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:02,336
Smile.

731
00:38:02,337 --> 00:38:06,507
(She practiced on and on to improve her weakness.)

732
00:38:09,378 --> 00:38:12,047
Are you confident about your performance?

733
00:38:12,677 --> 00:38:15,148
My cute act...

734
00:38:20,657 --> 00:38:22,288
That must be why she's popular.

735
00:38:24,157 --> 00:38:27,668
I'll use my cute act to win over your hearts.

736
00:38:29,567 --> 00:38:30,598
So cute.

737
00:38:30,938 --> 00:38:32,337
Everyone's favorite is here.

738
00:38:33,837 --> 00:38:37,777
("POP!" by Kotoko)

739
00:38:59,357 --> 00:39:00,368
She's cute.

740
00:39:01,898 --> 00:39:02,927
How cute.

741
00:39:14,878 --> 00:39:15,907
How is she so cute?

742
00:39:19,677 --> 00:39:20,717
So cute.

743
00:39:21,618 --> 00:39:22,688
So cute.

744
00:39:53,418 --> 00:39:54,517
She looks like a doll.

745
00:39:54,518 --> 00:39:56,717
- So cute. - She's adorable.

746
00:39:59,317 --> 00:40:00,628
Gosh, she crushed it.

747
00:40:04,628 --> 00:40:07,828
I want to keep her in my pocket and give her vocal lessons.

748
00:40:10,067 --> 00:40:11,497
I want to put her in my pocket.

749
00:40:11,498 --> 00:40:14,307
Kotoko, your existence is enough...

750
00:40:14,308 --> 00:40:16,676
to get people to love you.

751
00:40:16,677 --> 00:40:19,276
It all comes from your amazing charms.

752
00:40:19,277 --> 00:40:20,347
That's not easy.

753
00:40:20,348 --> 00:40:24,747
When I was a trainee, I really envied girls like you.

754
00:40:24,748 --> 00:40:27,517
I realized why you were so popular among the other participants...

755
00:40:27,518 --> 00:40:29,417
through your performance. Right?

756
00:40:29,418 --> 00:40:31,386
- It was extremely refreshing. - Thank you.

757
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:34,057
With this image of yours, if you can improve your skills,

758
00:40:34,058 --> 00:40:35,756
you will be even more perfect.

759
00:40:35,757 --> 00:40:36,797
Okay.

760
00:40:38,357 --> 00:40:39,898
Gosh. She's so adorable.

761
00:40:40,625 --> 00:40:42,665
Show us the battle result.

762
00:40:43,495 --> 00:40:46,205
(Who will be the winner of the 1-on-1 Battle?)

763
00:40:49,875 --> 00:40:52,003
Thank you.

764
00:40:52,004 --> 00:40:55,474
The winner of this battle is Yu.

765
00:40:55,475 --> 00:40:57,213
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

766
00:40:57,214 --> 00:40:59,745
- Thank you. - She's so cute.

767
00:41:00,714 --> 00:41:01,884
Thank you.

768
00:41:02,855 --> 00:41:05,854
- Thank you. - Thank you.

769
00:41:05,855 --> 00:41:06,924
Bye.

770
00:41:07,424 --> 00:41:08,654
They're so cute.

771
00:41:10,455 --> 00:41:11,725
You were so cute.

772
00:41:13,864 --> 00:41:15,664
When I was performing on stage,

773
00:41:15,665 --> 00:41:19,134
I had so much fun.

774
00:41:19,765 --> 00:41:24,303
So getting all five votes from the judges felt like a dream.

775
00:41:24,304 --> 00:41:26,975
(So getting all 5 votes from the judges felt like a dream.)

776
00:41:29,004 --> 00:41:30,843
Everyone from the low ranks won the battles so far.

777
00:41:30,844 --> 00:41:32,173
- You're right. - Yes.

778
00:41:32,174 --> 00:41:34,415
(The low-ranking participants continue to win the battles.)

779
00:41:36,884 --> 00:41:38,554
I'm so nervous right now.

780
00:41:39,984 --> 00:41:41,955
By the way, there's more pressure...

781
00:41:42,324 --> 00:41:44,094
on the high-ranking participants.

782
00:41:49,395 --> 00:41:51,534
We're ready for the next battle.

783
00:41:53,065 --> 00:41:54,564
Hello.

784
00:41:54,565 --> 00:41:55,903
(19th, Japan, Nana)

785
00:41:55,904 --> 00:41:57,234
She's so beautiful.

786
00:41:58,105 --> 00:42:00,503
How beautiful. Hello.

787
00:42:00,504 --> 00:42:01,644
(19th, Nana)

788
00:42:01,645 --> 00:42:03,614
Look at her! She's got mile-long legs!

789
00:42:03,975 --> 00:42:06,214
- Look at her legs. - Her legs are so long.

790
00:42:06,444 --> 00:42:07,745
She's beautiful.

791
00:42:08,745 --> 00:42:12,085
She has a lot of experience in her home country as a singer.

792
00:42:15,284 --> 00:42:18,193
(Nana is the beautiful member of PRIKIL with the center position.)

793
00:42:18,194 --> 00:42:20,864
I've seen her on TV.

794
00:42:20,924 --> 00:42:24,964
She also sparkled even beyond the TV screen.

795
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:27,064
(She's the girl people can't stop looking at again and again.)

796
00:42:27,065 --> 00:42:28,634
Can you look this way?

797
00:42:29,275 --> 00:42:31,335
When we were taking pictures for our portfolios,

798
00:42:31,734 --> 00:42:35,674
Nana exuded a strong aura which was unique to her.

799
00:42:35,944 --> 00:42:37,944
I think she draws people in.

800
00:42:39,074 --> 00:42:42,415
She stood out of the group.

801
00:42:45,254 --> 00:42:46,724
I'm an expressive person,

802
00:42:46,725 --> 00:42:51,355
and I think I have a charm that draws people in.

803
00:42:51,754 --> 00:42:53,564
That's why my goal is...

804
00:42:53,565 --> 00:42:55,364
to take the center position in Universe Ticket.

805
00:42:56,234 --> 00:42:58,134
Anyone in girl groups...

806
00:42:58,295 --> 00:43:00,804
would love to take this position.

807
00:43:01,205 --> 00:43:04,105
I'm confident that I can do a better job than anyone.

808
00:43:04,574 --> 00:43:08,074
I really want to prove that I deserve the position on the stage.

809
00:43:08,245 --> 00:43:09,443
(19th, Nana)

810
00:43:09,444 --> 00:43:13,185
("Gashina" by Nana)

811
00:43:42,344 --> 00:43:43,515
Her movements are beautiful.

812
00:43:55,284 --> 00:43:56,355
She's beautiful.

813
00:44:58,554 --> 00:45:00,085
She was so cool.

814
00:45:03,225 --> 00:45:04,625
Oh, my.

815
00:45:04,955 --> 00:45:06,494
Her performance definitely had a punch.

816
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:08,164
- That was cool. - It was really cool.

817
00:45:08,165 --> 00:45:09,264
Thank you.

818
00:45:09,265 --> 00:45:10,895
As for Nana,

819
00:45:11,165 --> 00:45:12,834
she picked a great song...

820
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:14,834
- that suited her image. - I agree.

821
00:45:14,835 --> 00:45:16,705
- Her movements are beautiful. - They are, aren't they?

822
00:45:17,734 --> 00:45:19,274
I was impressed with her gazes...

823
00:45:19,275 --> 00:45:21,604
and the angles of her fingers.

824
00:45:21,605 --> 00:45:24,745
Not a lot of dancers can nail them.

825
00:45:25,114 --> 00:45:28,384
But as for Nana, she was pretty good at delivering them.

826
00:45:28,815 --> 00:45:31,983
She knew exactly what to show and how to draw people in...

827
00:45:31,984 --> 00:45:33,125
during her performance.

828
00:45:34,525 --> 00:45:35,884
If I may be so bold to say this,

829
00:45:36,725 --> 00:45:38,355
she could have taken the center position.

830
00:45:38,895 --> 00:45:40,294
Thank you.

831
00:45:40,295 --> 00:45:42,964
The winner of this battle is Nana.

832
00:45:44,835 --> 00:45:46,033
(Nana wins the battle by a landslide.)

833
00:45:46,034 --> 00:45:47,264
Thank you.

834
00:45:47,265 --> 00:45:48,634
(Nana wins the battle by a landslide.)

835
00:45:48,734 --> 00:45:50,904
I guess it's something that can't change with girl groups.

836
00:45:53,004 --> 00:45:57,113
As her fellow member of the group who had performed with her,

837
00:45:57,114 --> 00:45:59,815
I could never be on the same level as Nana.

838
00:46:00,085 --> 00:46:04,684
As her colleague and rival who had performed with her,

839
00:46:04,685 --> 00:46:07,324
it motivated me and encouraged me to try harder.

840
00:46:08,625 --> 00:46:12,963
(In 2021, at the age of 14)

841
00:46:12,964 --> 00:46:15,165
(she partook in an audition show for a girl group in Japan.)

842
00:46:15,395 --> 00:46:17,765
I will announce the fourth member.

843
00:46:17,964 --> 00:46:20,364
(She made it to the top 5.)

844
00:46:20,534 --> 00:46:24,934
(She performed as a member of PRIKIL with Nana.)

845
00:46:24,935 --> 00:46:27,245
(Yukino, Nana)

846
00:46:27,645 --> 00:46:29,774
(Then she started anew with her second challenge.)

847
00:46:29,775 --> 00:46:33,214
I had always been interested in performing in Korea.

848
00:46:33,284 --> 00:46:35,745
I wanted to use this chance to give it a try.

849
00:46:35,844 --> 00:46:37,784
So I'm very looking forward to this.

850
00:46:38,784 --> 00:46:40,283
(73rd, Japan, Yukino versus...)

851
00:46:40,284 --> 00:46:42,653
(11th, the Philippines, Elisia)

852
00:46:42,654 --> 00:46:46,094
This battle has participants who are beloved in their home countries.

853
00:46:46,165 --> 00:46:47,824
A child actress from the Philippines...

854
00:46:48,295 --> 00:46:49,694
versus a member of a girl group from Japan.

855
00:46:52,034 --> 00:46:56,335
(There's a big difference in their rankings.)

856
00:46:57,134 --> 00:46:58,435
Oh, my.

857
00:46:58,475 --> 00:47:00,144
Elisia picked me.

858
00:47:00,145 --> 00:47:02,204
(Elisia picked me.)

859
00:47:02,205 --> 00:47:08,585
I thought about why she chose me as her opponent.

860
00:47:08,614 --> 00:47:11,254
She might have chosen me because she thought...

861
00:47:11,585 --> 00:47:14,323
she had a shot at winning against someone at my level.

862
00:47:14,324 --> 00:47:16,524
I was upset.

863
00:47:16,525 --> 00:47:18,324
So I'm going to do my best to win.

864
00:47:20,125 --> 00:47:22,835
Do you think you can show a comeback from a low-ranking participant?

865
00:47:24,295 --> 00:47:26,065
I can. Yes.

866
00:47:30,105 --> 00:47:32,234
- You can do it. - Good luck.

867
00:47:33,004 --> 00:47:34,205
You're cute.

868
00:47:35,705 --> 00:47:36,914
You got this.

869
00:47:36,915 --> 00:47:38,975
- Doesn't she resemble Chuu? - Right.

870
00:47:39,214 --> 00:47:41,315
- Yes. Right? - She does resemble Chuu.

871
00:47:43,884 --> 00:47:45,184
(73rd, Yukino)

872
00:47:45,185 --> 00:47:50,094
("DUMB DUMB" by Yukino)

873
00:47:50,194 --> 00:47:51,895
- So cute. - How cute.

874
00:48:03,975 --> 00:48:06,275
- So cute. - Was she looking at the camera?

875
00:48:39,645 --> 00:48:40,844
She's so cool.

876
00:49:14,944 --> 00:49:16,174
Thank you.

877
00:49:16,574 --> 00:49:18,315
Was she with the girl group for a long time?

878
00:49:19,145 --> 00:49:20,245
She's good.

879
00:49:20,614 --> 00:49:23,954
Your performance got more powerful as it progressed.

880
00:49:23,955 --> 00:49:26,324
Your facial expressions got better.

881
00:49:26,384 --> 00:49:27,423
An unexpected charm.

882
00:49:27,424 --> 00:49:28,784
I enjoyed it.

883
00:49:28,884 --> 00:49:30,225
Thank you.

884
00:49:34,565 --> 00:49:39,835
Hello. I'm from the Philippines. My name is Elisia.

885
00:49:39,964 --> 00:49:41,804
I'm 15 years old.

886
00:49:42,404 --> 00:49:47,073
(She was 9 years old in the video.)

887
00:49:47,074 --> 00:49:49,944
Singing has been natural for me since I was a child.

888
00:49:50,375 --> 00:49:52,073
I remember. I started dreaming...

889
00:49:52,074 --> 00:49:55,015
of singing and performing through musicals.

890
00:49:55,844 --> 00:49:59,924
(She was 9 years old in the video.)

891
00:50:02,424 --> 00:50:05,125
I developed a strong interest in K-pop.

892
00:50:05,225 --> 00:50:08,225
So since then, I've been learning Korean.

893
00:50:08,295 --> 00:50:10,033
I've been consistently trying to learn...

894
00:50:10,034 --> 00:50:11,934
the dance to K-pop songs from the moment...

895
00:50:11,935 --> 00:50:13,903
I stay up until night.

896
00:50:13,904 --> 00:50:15,265
(11th, the Philippines, Elisia)

897
00:50:15,464 --> 00:50:17,734
I knew that K-pop was for me.

898
00:50:18,134 --> 00:50:20,974
And the universe is giving me signs...

899
00:50:20,975 --> 00:50:23,645
that I should pursue my dream in K-pop.

900
00:50:23,745 --> 00:50:27,484
It's just a matter of when, who, and how.

901
00:50:28,284 --> 00:50:31,484
(She ended up on Universe Ticket because she was drawn to K-pop.)

902
00:50:33,324 --> 00:50:35,883
- Thank you! - I was very happy.

903
00:50:35,884 --> 00:50:37,324
This is so cool.

904
00:50:37,395 --> 00:50:40,025
I wanted to jump.

905
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:42,795
But the studio set...

906
00:50:42,895 --> 00:50:44,134
It might break.

907
00:50:44,864 --> 00:50:47,605
It just really sank into me that...

908
00:50:47,765 --> 00:50:49,674
"Gosh. This is real."

909
00:50:49,904 --> 00:50:53,044
"I'm actually part of Universe Ticket."

910
00:50:53,045 --> 00:50:54,474
I almost cried.

911
00:50:54,475 --> 00:50:56,713
(I almost cried.)

912
00:50:56,714 --> 00:50:58,014
I'm still tearing up.

913
00:50:58,015 --> 00:51:00,185
- I'm sorry. - No. It's okay.

914
00:51:01,714 --> 00:51:04,284
This is my dream.

915
00:51:04,984 --> 00:51:07,085
I have to do whatever it takes.

916
00:51:07,855 --> 00:51:09,024
She's gorgeous.

917
00:51:09,025 --> 00:51:10,124
How should I put it?

918
00:51:10,125 --> 00:51:11,494
This is a difficult song.

919
00:51:11,495 --> 00:51:12,554
(ADORA)

920
00:51:12,855 --> 00:51:15,995
("Selfish" by Elisia)

921
00:51:38,114 --> 00:51:39,514
How is she this good at singing?

922
00:51:39,515 --> 00:51:40,784
Right?

923
00:52:24,335 --> 00:52:25,864
Just say so

924
00:52:28,004 --> 00:52:29,065
How cute.

925
00:52:37,375 --> 00:52:38,614
Gosh, what was that?

926
00:52:39,074 --> 00:52:41,145
- That was amazing. - Good job.

927
00:52:41,714 --> 00:52:44,214
- She's cute with that ending pose. - Thank you.

928
00:52:47,054 --> 00:52:48,424
She did well.

929
00:52:49,225 --> 00:52:50,524
She's good.

930
00:52:50,525 --> 00:52:51,753
- That was great. - I agree.

931
00:52:51,754 --> 00:52:52,824
Thank you.

932
00:52:52,924 --> 00:52:55,194
- Did she really sing live? - Thank you.

933
00:52:55,495 --> 00:52:56,994
I know, right? I thought it was a recording.

934
00:52:56,995 --> 00:52:58,495
- Me, too. - You know, a recording of the song.

935
00:52:58,864 --> 00:53:01,533
You chose the perfect song...

936
00:53:01,534 --> 00:53:03,704
- that would highlight your voice. - Yes.

937
00:53:03,705 --> 00:53:05,033
- It suited you well. - Totally.

938
00:53:05,034 --> 00:53:06,303
She did great.

939
00:53:06,304 --> 00:53:08,045
Thank you.

940
00:53:08,875 --> 00:53:14,515
Your dance moves were very rhythmic.

941
00:53:14,645 --> 00:53:16,584
Even the dance suited you too.

942
00:53:16,585 --> 00:53:18,284
You used your energy well.

943
00:53:18,855 --> 00:53:20,983
- She was really flexible. - Right?

944
00:53:20,984 --> 00:53:22,923
- Like this part of her body. - This part.

945
00:53:22,924 --> 00:53:23,954
So...

946
00:53:23,955 --> 00:53:27,193
Your skills are as good as those who are currently working...

947
00:53:27,194 --> 00:53:29,394
as female idols.

948
00:53:29,395 --> 00:53:30,994
Watching you made me really happy.

949
00:53:30,995 --> 00:53:32,065
- Yes. - Gosh.

950
00:53:32,935 --> 00:53:34,864
- She's adorable. - Thank you.

951
00:53:36,875 --> 00:53:38,134
That was a great compliment.

952
00:53:38,234 --> 00:53:40,544
- She pulled it off really well. - That was Elisia.

953
00:53:40,545 --> 00:53:42,803
It's a pity when two skilled participants compete.

954
00:53:42,804 --> 00:53:44,114
- I totally get you. - Right?

955
00:53:45,214 --> 00:53:46,984
- It's hard. - I know.

956
00:53:48,284 --> 00:53:49,383
You're cool.

957
00:53:49,384 --> 00:53:52,585
You're cool. I mean it.

958
00:53:52,784 --> 00:53:54,254
You're so cute.

959
00:53:55,025 --> 00:53:56,054
Thank you.

960
00:53:56,384 --> 00:53:57,924
Those two know how to make a show.

961
00:53:59,225 --> 00:54:00,225
That was so cute.

962
00:54:01,625 --> 00:54:03,065
Who do you think will win?

963
00:54:04,464 --> 00:54:05,794
Honestly...

964
00:54:05,795 --> 00:54:08,503
(11th, Philippines, Elisia)

965
00:54:08,504 --> 00:54:09,534
Me.

966
00:54:10,335 --> 00:54:11,335
Me.

967
00:54:15,004 --> 00:54:16,875
I'm quite confident.

968
00:54:19,275 --> 00:54:21,515
- That's cool. - Who do you think will win?

969
00:54:22,245 --> 00:54:23,355
Me?

970
00:54:24,185 --> 00:54:25,214
How cute.

971
00:54:25,855 --> 00:54:28,125
You two were incredible to that extent.

972
00:54:28,884 --> 00:54:31,054
- Thank you. - This is a close game.

973
00:54:31,395 --> 00:54:33,464
Show us the battle result.

974
00:54:34,694 --> 00:54:36,634
- I can't predict it. - Me neither.

975
00:54:36,765 --> 00:54:41,233
I believed there was a possibility I could win,

976
00:54:41,234 --> 00:54:43,234
so I waited with confidence.

977
00:54:43,775 --> 00:54:46,234
I have confidence in myself.

978
00:54:47,004 --> 00:54:48,074
I can't guess at all.

979
00:54:48,275 --> 00:54:49,705
It's a nip and tuck.

980
00:54:49,875 --> 00:54:50,875
Who will win?

981
00:54:54,915 --> 00:54:57,883
(11th Elisia: 3, 73rd Yukino: 2)

982
00:54:57,884 --> 00:55:00,784
- It was a close game. - It really was one.

983
00:55:00,955 --> 00:55:02,125
A really close game.

984
00:55:02,284 --> 00:55:03,955
Both of them are so cool.

985
00:55:04,054 --> 00:55:06,625
- Great work. You did well. - Thank you.

986
00:55:06,864 --> 00:55:07,995
"You did well?"

987
00:55:08,525 --> 00:55:10,665
(Gosh, she's so cute.)

988
00:55:11,435 --> 00:55:13,335
- Thank you. - Thank you.

989
00:55:13,605 --> 00:55:14,665
Thank you.

990
00:55:15,034 --> 00:55:16,264
Even though Elisia is younger,

991
00:55:16,265 --> 00:55:17,434
- she said, "You did well." - "Well."

992
00:55:17,435 --> 00:55:18,504
"You did well."

993
00:55:18,674 --> 00:55:20,645
- That was cute. - I agree.

994
00:55:22,105 --> 00:55:23,545
- Hi. - A heart.

995
00:55:24,245 --> 00:55:26,145
We're really cute!

996
00:55:26,515 --> 00:55:28,245
- We did great. - We did great.

997
00:55:28,444 --> 00:55:30,614
Both of us did a great job.

998
00:55:31,384 --> 00:55:33,554
I was super nervous.

999
00:55:33,824 --> 00:55:36,024
The two participants for the upcoming battle...

1000
00:55:36,025 --> 00:55:38,154
seize the stage with their powerful performance.

1001
00:55:38,995 --> 00:55:40,624
It's a battle between Kim Sujin in 39th place...

1002
00:55:40,625 --> 00:55:43,564
- It's Sujin. - and Bae Haram in 71st place.

1003
00:55:43,565 --> 00:55:44,634
I'm curious.

1004
00:55:45,034 --> 00:55:47,504
I heard those two were beyond amazing.

1005
00:55:47,964 --> 00:55:50,074
Apparently, Haram is really good.

1006
00:55:51,004 --> 00:55:53,374
- I saw her video. - She's good, right?

1007
00:55:53,375 --> 00:55:55,145
- Isn't she good? - She's got this charm.

1008
00:55:55,605 --> 00:55:57,914
The toughest-looking participant among the low ranks.

1009
00:55:57,915 --> 00:55:59,315
It was Haram.

1010
00:55:59,775 --> 00:56:01,484
Bae Haram.

1011
00:56:01,614 --> 00:56:02,784
Haram.

1012
00:56:03,284 --> 00:56:06,855
We watched the first 20 minutes of the video.

1013
00:56:07,284 --> 00:56:09,125
- She's no joke. - She scared me.

1014
00:56:09,455 --> 00:56:10,554
What do I do?

1015
00:56:13,225 --> 00:56:15,124
I knew I couldn't beat her and turned...

1016
00:56:15,125 --> 00:56:17,034
the video off because she was too good.

1017
00:56:18,265 --> 00:56:19,963
Hi.

1018
00:56:19,964 --> 00:56:21,105
(Exploring the high rank's Search Room)

1019
00:56:21,904 --> 00:56:24,704
I never learned how to sing.

1020
00:56:24,705 --> 00:56:26,205
(71st, Korea, Bae Haram)

1021
00:56:27,145 --> 00:56:28,605
What song are you singing?

1022
00:56:29,245 --> 00:56:30,844
- Can I reveal it? - Yes.

1023
00:56:31,174 --> 00:56:34,245
I'm singing "What Type of X" by Jessi.

1024
00:56:35,214 --> 00:56:36,484
Can't you sing us a bit of the song?

1025
00:56:36,884 --> 00:56:38,084
- One line. - Right now?

1026
00:56:38,085 --> 00:56:40,455
- How about a line each? - We'll all sing a line each.

1027
00:56:41,054 --> 00:56:44,654
I put on heavier makeup

1028
00:56:44,895 --> 00:56:47,294
I'm a born bad girl

1029
00:56:47,295 --> 00:56:50,534
I draw you in

1030
00:56:51,395 --> 00:56:53,705
Honestly, I thought she was a doable opponent.

1031
00:56:54,105 --> 00:56:57,774
An idol needs to be good at...

1032
00:56:57,775 --> 00:57:01,444
both dancing and singing.

1033
00:57:01,605 --> 00:57:05,545
I could see that she was a bit anxious.

1034
00:57:06,174 --> 00:57:09,914
Thinking I could beat her,

1035
00:57:09,915 --> 00:57:11,355
I chose her.

1036
00:57:12,754 --> 00:57:16,955
Of course, I am confident in my singing and dancing.

1037
00:57:17,125 --> 00:57:20,625
But I'm most confident about my facial expressions.

1038
00:57:20,924 --> 00:57:23,224
I think I'll be able to kill...

1039
00:57:23,225 --> 00:57:26,633
my opponent's spirit with my expressions...

1040
00:57:26,634 --> 00:57:30,375
and bring her down a peg.

1041
00:57:30,534 --> 00:57:31,605
Please look forward to it.

1042
00:57:32,734 --> 00:57:33,975
I bet she'll pull it off well.

1043
00:57:34,105 --> 00:57:36,003
- Sujin! - You can do it!

1044
00:57:36,004 --> 00:57:37,644
- You can do it! - She has a hat.

1045
00:57:37,645 --> 00:57:38,714
You can do it!

1046
00:58:01,864 --> 00:58:02,964
Her voice is so pretty.

1047
00:58:06,205 --> 00:58:07,545
She's good at singing.

1048
00:58:09,344 --> 00:58:10,375
Nice.

1049
00:58:23,350 --> 00:58:24,890
She was good. No, incredible.

1050
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:27,560
Let's watch the low rank's performance.

1051
00:58:28,589 --> 00:58:30,460
- You can do it! - You can do it!

1052
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,000
A prop.

1053
00:58:34,330 --> 00:58:36,029
Is she using a standing microphone?

1054
00:58:37,199 --> 00:58:38,239
Look at her.

1055
00:58:38,770 --> 00:58:40,140
Things are getting interesting.

1056
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:45,739
I gave it my all preparing for this performance.

1057
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:48,710
I'll make her regret that she chose me.

1058
00:58:49,049 --> 00:58:50,080
- She's pretty. - I'm looking forward to it.

1059
00:58:50,210 --> 00:58:51,579
- You can do it, Haram! - Haram!

1060
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:53,020
- You can do it! - Go for it, Haram!

1061
00:58:53,319 --> 00:58:54,818
(39th Kim Sujin, 71st Bae Haram)

1062
00:58:54,819 --> 00:58:59,318
("What Type of X" by Bae Haram)

1063
00:58:59,319 --> 00:59:00,390
I'm getting excited.

1064
00:59:33,390 --> 00:59:35,230
Oh, my gosh. She's so good!

1065
01:00:07,830 --> 01:00:08,930
Gosh, she split her legs.

1066
01:00:15,469 --> 01:00:17,100
She is cool.

1067
01:00:17,699 --> 01:00:19,298
- Yes! - Yes!

1068
01:00:19,299 --> 01:00:20,770
She really came prepared.

1069
01:00:29,449 --> 01:00:30,480
My goodness!

1070
01:00:30,879 --> 01:00:32,850
- My goodness. - My goodness.

1071
01:00:34,719 --> 01:00:36,290
- Thank you. - She is so cool.

1072
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:38,418
She is so cool.

1073
01:00:38,419 --> 01:00:40,020
Is her neck okay?

1074
01:00:40,890 --> 01:00:42,460
She broke the stage.

1075
01:00:42,489 --> 01:00:44,029
She broke it.

1076
01:00:44,799 --> 01:00:46,399
What is up with this match?

1077
01:00:46,759 --> 01:00:50,000
Shouldn't both of them win?

1078
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:53,540
Gosh.

1079
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:56,108
- This is the hardest. - It's so hard.

1080
01:00:56,109 --> 01:00:57,709
- It's so hard. - It's too bad.

1081
01:00:57,710 --> 01:00:59,338
I know. It's so hard.

1082
01:00:59,339 --> 01:01:00,810
(The two participants showed incredible skills.)

1083
01:01:02,810 --> 01:01:04,679
One of them was very cool,

1084
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:06,619
- and the other was very hot. - Yes.

1085
01:01:06,620 --> 01:01:07,749
That was the vibe I got.

1086
01:01:07,750 --> 01:01:08,889
This is so hard.

1087
01:01:08,890 --> 01:01:10,959
Both of them met too strong of an opponent.

1088
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:11,960
Seriously.

1089
01:01:11,961 --> 01:01:14,689
Haram didn't just do well.

1090
01:01:14,690 --> 01:01:18,398
- She showed her charms properly. - Yes.

1091
01:01:18,399 --> 01:01:20,060
- That's right. - Thank you.

1092
01:01:20,199 --> 01:01:22,999
I really felt like I was watching a performance.

1093
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,770
It was perfect until the end.

1094
01:01:28,656 --> 01:01:31,695
I think both participants were fully aware of their strengths...

1095
01:01:31,696 --> 01:01:34,465
when they prepared for the performances.

1096
01:01:34,466 --> 01:01:37,807
So it's really hard to vote.

1097
01:01:39,307 --> 01:01:40,707
It's really hard.

1098
01:01:42,176 --> 01:01:43,775
- It's really hard. - How am I supposed to pick one?

1099
01:01:43,776 --> 01:01:45,005
- Right? - How am I supposed to do it?

1100
01:01:45,006 --> 01:01:47,046
Does this show have a free pass rule?

1101
01:01:47,347 --> 01:01:48,675
It's about personal preference.

1102
01:01:48,676 --> 01:01:50,687
- It's so hard. - Seriously.

1103
01:01:51,316 --> 01:01:53,287
- It's about personal preference. - Yes.

1104
01:01:53,586 --> 01:01:57,326
I think it was the hardest choice yet.

1105
01:01:57,327 --> 01:02:00,626
Now, show us the battle result.

1106
01:02:01,856 --> 01:02:04,997
I think I gave a more charismatic performance.

1107
01:02:05,526 --> 01:02:06,597
Three to two?

1108
01:02:07,637 --> 01:02:11,707
I think I will receive more votes even by one.

1109
01:02:12,792 --> 01:02:15,203
Show us the battle result.

1110
01:02:16,533 --> 01:02:19,632
I think I gave a more charismatic performance.

1111
01:02:20,103 --> 01:02:21,243
Three to two?

1112
01:02:22,302 --> 01:02:26,341
I think I will receive more votes even by one.

1113
01:02:26,342 --> 01:02:28,313
(39th Kim Sujin, 71st Bae Haram)

1114
01:02:31,613 --> 01:02:34,381
(39th Kim Sujin: 3, 71st Bae Haram: 2)

1115
01:02:34,382 --> 01:02:41,663
(39th Kim Sujin: 3, 71st Bae Haram: 2)

1116
01:02:44,392 --> 01:02:45,932
It's too bad.

1117
01:02:47,103 --> 01:02:50,332
The winner is Kim Sujin. Congratulations.

1118
01:02:50,502 --> 01:02:51,832
Thank you.

1119
01:02:52,632 --> 01:02:53,942
It's a shame to say...

1120
01:02:53,943 --> 01:02:56,203
- that one of them lost. - It's bad.

1121
01:02:56,373 --> 01:02:58,012
Haram did so well.

1122
01:03:00,413 --> 01:03:01,711
But I have a feeling...

1123
01:03:01,712 --> 01:03:03,852
- that she should be a dancer. - At first...

1124
01:03:03,853 --> 01:03:05,782
At first, I had that vibe.

1125
01:03:05,783 --> 01:03:08,022
But she needs to adjust herself.

1126
01:03:08,023 --> 01:03:10,051
- That's right. - It's what she needs to do.

1127
01:03:10,052 --> 01:03:11,591
That's right.

1128
01:03:11,592 --> 01:03:12,693
This isn't about becoming a soloist.

1129
01:03:13,563 --> 01:03:14,722
I am disappointed.

1130
01:03:15,693 --> 01:03:16,733
Are you disappointed?

1131
01:03:17,332 --> 01:03:18,762
It can't be helped.

1132
01:03:20,903 --> 01:03:22,461
Still, it's okay.

1133
01:03:22,462 --> 01:03:25,472
I can win next time.

1134
01:03:28,802 --> 01:03:30,971
(The next participant who will take the stage)

1135
01:03:30,972 --> 01:03:32,113
(2nd, Kwon Chaewon)

1136
01:03:32,672 --> 01:03:34,582
It's Kwon Chaewon.

1137
01:03:35,483 --> 01:03:38,413
- A member of DIA. - Yes.

1138
01:03:39,813 --> 01:03:42,023
- She was a member of DIA. - Yes.

1139
01:03:42,323 --> 01:03:44,352
(Which participant did Kwon Chaewon choose?)

1140
01:03:44,353 --> 01:03:46,222
- Jieun. - Jeon Jieun.

1141
01:03:46,453 --> 01:03:49,023
- Isn't Jeon Jieun in Busters? - That's right.

1142
01:03:49,493 --> 01:03:52,792
This time, we will see a battle between the girl group members.

1143
01:03:53,733 --> 01:03:56,461
A former girl group member, second, Kwon Chaewon...

1144
01:03:56,462 --> 01:04:00,203
(A former girl group member, 2nd, Korea, Kwon Chaewon)

1145
01:04:00,773 --> 01:04:04,372
and a current girl group member, 42nd, Jeon Jieun will compete.

1146
01:04:04,373 --> 01:04:06,573
(A current girl group member, 42nd, Korea, Jeon Jieun)

1147
01:04:07,182 --> 01:04:10,182
(2nd, Korea, Kwon Chaewon versus 42nd, Korea, Jeon Jieun)

1148
01:04:10,353 --> 01:04:12,751
Is there a participant you are the most curious about?

1149
01:04:12,752 --> 01:04:15,522
I am curious about Kwon Chaewon.

1150
01:04:15,523 --> 01:04:16,953
Kwon Chaewon.

1151
01:04:17,052 --> 01:04:19,051
Kwon Chaewon.

1152
01:04:19,052 --> 01:04:23,023
There is something I remember from my childhood.

1153
01:04:23,292 --> 01:04:25,062
(A photo Bang Yunha found from her photo album)

1154
01:04:25,063 --> 01:04:27,002
(9-year-old Bang Yunha)

1155
01:04:27,063 --> 01:04:29,902
Chaewon was in my photo.

1156
01:04:29,903 --> 01:04:32,971
Seriously, I was so shocked.

1157
01:04:32,972 --> 01:04:37,112
I gasped loudly because I was so startled.

1158
01:04:37,113 --> 01:04:40,443
It's incredible that I am seeing her again here.

1159
01:04:42,082 --> 01:04:46,252
(Kwon Chaewon of DIA worked hard and showed various performances.)

1160
01:04:47,052 --> 01:04:50,051
She is someone who debuted once.

1161
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:52,251
She has worked as an idol singer for years,

1162
01:04:52,252 --> 01:04:56,222
so I think she must have incredible skills.

1163
01:04:58,233 --> 01:05:01,563
(But in 2022, the team disbanded when the contract expired.)

1164
01:05:01,802 --> 01:05:06,672
It was a team that gave the spotlight to one member.

1165
01:05:06,802 --> 01:05:09,773
"So-and-so and the girls."

1166
01:05:09,903 --> 01:05:13,272
There were many people who left malicious comments...

1167
01:05:13,273 --> 01:05:14,913
because of that.

1168
01:05:15,042 --> 01:05:18,152
In a sense, I am here...

1169
01:05:18,153 --> 01:05:20,353
because I want to show them...

1170
01:05:20,552 --> 01:05:22,882
what I can do.

1171
01:05:23,722 --> 01:05:25,952
My name is Kwon Chaewon, right?

1172
01:05:25,953 --> 01:05:28,722
I want to be number one.

1173
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:32,563
(Why did she pick Jeon Jieun, a current girl group member?)

1174
01:05:32,932 --> 01:05:35,863
My reason is very simple.

1175
01:05:35,962 --> 01:05:39,033
Since it's a battle,

1176
01:05:39,132 --> 01:05:42,243
you are bound to pick someone who is weaker than you.

1177
01:05:42,403 --> 01:05:46,011
In my eyes, Jeon Jieun...

1178
01:05:46,012 --> 01:05:50,613
seemed to be lacking in some ways.

1179
01:05:51,353 --> 01:05:53,012
I took second place.

1180
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:56,381
I will show everyone...

1181
01:05:56,382 --> 01:05:59,452
how scary and formidable second place is...

1182
01:05:59,453 --> 01:06:01,993
and win confidently.

1183
01:06:02,993 --> 01:06:04,461
Chaewon,

1184
01:06:04,462 --> 01:06:08,363
you said that picking the right song was a skill.

1185
01:06:08,462 --> 01:06:10,202
- Really? - Why did you say that?

1186
01:06:10,203 --> 01:06:14,402
She picked her own song.

1187
01:06:14,403 --> 01:06:17,341
I truly respect and understand...

1188
01:06:17,342 --> 01:06:18,773
that it's a nice choice.

1189
01:06:18,913 --> 01:06:23,313
But since we are on an audition show,

1190
01:06:24,382 --> 01:06:26,881
I don't think you should pick your own song...

1191
01:06:26,882 --> 01:06:29,352
you are familiar with and can perform well.

1192
01:06:29,353 --> 01:06:33,392
I think you should prepare a new song diligently...

1193
01:06:33,623 --> 01:06:35,623
and perform it.

1194
01:06:36,123 --> 01:06:39,493
I think she is full of confidence.

1195
01:06:39,693 --> 01:06:42,132
- This will be interesting to watch. - I know.

1196
01:06:42,603 --> 01:06:46,632
Let's first check out a performance by a higher-ranked participant.

1197
01:06:46,842 --> 01:06:47,943
Okay.

1198
01:06:48,873 --> 01:06:50,813
- Good luck. - Good luck.

1199
01:06:50,972 --> 01:06:52,472
Let's go.

1200
01:06:54,012 --> 01:06:55,341
I can't wait.

1201
01:06:55,342 --> 01:06:58,153
I want to show my relaxed side...

1202
01:06:58,283 --> 01:07:00,081
to everyone.

1203
01:07:00,082 --> 01:07:02,623
That's how I want them to see my performance.

1204
01:07:02,653 --> 01:07:04,792
I am excited about the song. Right?

1205
01:07:05,052 --> 01:07:06,592
- I am excited about the song. - I am excited too.

1206
01:07:06,823 --> 01:07:08,422
- I think she will do well. - I can't wait.

1207
01:07:09,123 --> 01:07:10,532
(2nd, Kwon Chaewon)

1208
01:07:10,533 --> 01:07:14,332
("Heroine" by Kwon Chaewon)

1209
01:08:40,483 --> 01:08:44,123
- It made me hold my breath. - Seriously.

1210
01:08:44,853 --> 01:08:47,722
Now, let's check out a performance by a lower-ranked participant.

1211
01:08:50,533 --> 01:08:54,403
("Broken Clock" by Jeon Jieun)

1212
01:09:37,172 --> 01:09:38,172
My goodness.

1213
01:09:47,353 --> 01:09:48,483
I can't believe it.

1214
01:09:54,262 --> 01:09:55,792
This is bad.

1215
01:09:55,823 --> 01:09:57,063
This is bad.

1216
01:10:07,773 --> 01:10:11,042
Let me carefully judge...

1217
01:10:11,413 --> 01:10:15,542
the two participants' performances.

1218
01:10:19,983 --> 01:10:21,882
If I may dare myself to say this...

1219
01:10:25,092 --> 01:10:26,823
I don't think...

1220
01:10:27,363 --> 01:10:30,733
a girl group member's skills are that important.

1221
01:10:30,932 --> 01:10:32,033
However,

1222
01:10:32,493 --> 01:10:33,961
your lacking skills...

1223
01:10:33,962 --> 01:10:35,103
shouldn't be apparent on the stage.

1224
01:10:35,603 --> 01:10:36,962
You can't let people see them.

1225
01:10:37,103 --> 01:10:39,331
To hide them, you work hard...

1226
01:10:39,332 --> 01:10:40,873
with your blood, sweat, and tears...

1227
01:10:41,172 --> 01:10:42,641
and give the perfect performance.

1228
01:10:42,642 --> 01:10:44,712
I think that's what an idol singer does.

1229
01:10:45,142 --> 01:10:46,472
Even if you are lacking,

1230
01:10:47,512 --> 01:10:48,711
you should complete the performance.

1231
01:10:48,712 --> 01:10:51,181
But the two of you...

1232
01:10:51,182 --> 01:10:53,682
One person is a current girl group member,

1233
01:10:54,382 --> 01:10:55,922
and the other is a former girl group member.

1234
01:10:58,792 --> 01:10:59,892
You know,

1235
01:11:01,493 --> 01:11:03,363
those titles seem very meaningless.

1236
01:11:06,292 --> 01:11:10,733
Even if you are a member who sings for only 20 seconds,

1237
01:11:10,832 --> 01:11:13,172
you really should hide your lacking skills...

1238
01:11:13,233 --> 01:11:15,373
in those 20 seconds.

1239
01:11:15,472 --> 01:11:19,273
I don't think it became apparent because you sang for 82 seconds.

1240
01:11:19,712 --> 01:11:22,182
Even if the 2 of you had 20 seconds,

1241
01:11:22,712 --> 01:11:24,283
the end result would have been similar.

1242
01:11:25,012 --> 01:11:27,352
I am quite disappointed.

1243
01:11:27,353 --> 01:11:30,523
I think the two of you should practice a lot.

1244
01:11:37,863 --> 01:11:39,461
Do the two of you want to continue...

1245
01:11:39,462 --> 01:11:41,432
going in this line of work?

1246
01:11:42,703 --> 01:11:43,802
Yes.

1247
01:11:44,773 --> 01:11:46,773
Yes, that's why I am here.

1248
01:11:47,302 --> 01:11:50,301
It was a difficult challenge,

1249
01:11:50,302 --> 01:11:52,073
but I made up my mind and came here.

1250
01:11:52,613 --> 01:11:54,112
The era keeps changing.

1251
01:11:54,113 --> 01:11:55,982
The next chapter comes,

1252
01:11:55,983 --> 01:11:57,552
and the next generation moves up.

1253
01:11:57,882 --> 01:11:59,653
When you experience those things continuously,

1254
01:12:01,252 --> 01:12:03,822
you often become isolated.

1255
01:12:03,823 --> 01:12:05,452
You guys have been around for 7 and 5 years respectively,

1256
01:12:05,453 --> 01:12:07,592
so a chapter has passed already.

1257
01:12:08,023 --> 01:12:10,831
So for a new challenge,

1258
01:12:10,832 --> 01:12:13,332
you must not use your old ways.

1259
01:12:14,603 --> 01:12:17,302
You must keep learning.

1260
01:12:17,832 --> 01:12:19,372
In everything, fool yourself...

1261
01:12:19,373 --> 01:12:22,001
into thinking that it's your first experience...

1262
01:12:22,002 --> 01:12:23,703
and look at things as if it's your first time.

1263
01:12:24,113 --> 01:12:26,613
If you do that, you will have a better outlook.

1264
01:12:26,813 --> 01:12:28,042
Thank you for your hard work.

1265
01:12:29,582 --> 01:12:31,052
My goodness.

1266
01:12:33,752 --> 01:12:34,783
(Kwon Chaewon, 2nd, Jeon Jieun, 42nd)

1267
01:12:46,563 --> 01:12:48,233
What should I do?

1268
01:12:57,373 --> 01:12:59,443
I'm sorry.

1269
01:13:04,712 --> 01:13:07,853
I took the stage for the 1st time in 3 years.

1270
01:13:12,392 --> 01:13:15,993
"I was the only one who had stopped in time."

1271
01:13:17,863 --> 01:13:21,533
I thought, "I was the only one who had stopped in time."

1272
01:13:22,432 --> 01:13:26,273
I can't beat anyone this way.

1273
01:13:27,172 --> 01:13:30,913
I can't take the stage again this way. I truly felt that.

1274
01:13:42,983 --> 01:13:44,123
Gosh.

1275
01:13:45,493 --> 01:13:46,623
What should I do?

1276
01:13:47,962 --> 01:13:52,732
When I saw them receive bad reviews from Universe Icons,

1277
01:13:52,733 --> 01:13:55,533
I thought, "I don't know how my performance will go."

1278
01:13:55,663 --> 01:13:58,802
I became determined to do better.

1279
01:13:59,802 --> 01:14:01,772
The next battle is between the participants...

1280
01:14:01,773 --> 01:14:03,603
with exceptional live performance skills.

1281
01:14:03,943 --> 01:14:07,042
(31st, Bang Yunha)

1282
01:14:11,752 --> 01:14:13,381
(31st, Korea, Bang Yunha)

1283
01:14:13,382 --> 01:14:14,622
She must be really nervous.

1284
01:14:14,623 --> 01:14:16,052
(31st, Korea, Bang Yunha)

1285
01:14:16,283 --> 01:14:17,752
She must be really nervous.

1286
01:14:24,792 --> 01:14:25,891
It's "Sneakers."

1287
01:14:25,892 --> 01:14:27,233
(It's "Sneakers.")

1288
01:14:27,962 --> 01:14:29,163
It's "Sneakers."

1289
01:14:29,903 --> 01:14:31,171
I am excited.

1290
01:14:31,172 --> 01:14:33,273
- I hope she does well. - I really hope she does well.

1291
01:14:33,632 --> 01:14:36,172
(31st, Bang Yunha)

1292
01:14:37,073 --> 01:14:38,212
Nice point.

1293
01:14:40,313 --> 01:14:43,182
("Sneakers" by Bang Yunha)

1294
01:14:53,523 --> 01:14:54,962
What?

1295
01:14:55,762 --> 01:14:56,922
That's it.

1296
01:14:56,962 --> 01:14:58,832
She can dance well.

1297
01:15:02,262 --> 01:15:03,863
She has so much talent.

1298
01:15:09,943 --> 01:15:11,913
She is really good.

1299
01:15:22,483 --> 01:15:23,623
She is charming.

1300
01:15:35,332 --> 01:15:36,832
She knows the key points.

1301
01:15:48,842 --> 01:15:50,042
This is incredible.

1302
01:15:52,182 --> 01:15:53,382
She is really good.

1303
01:16:02,193 --> 01:16:04,592
(31st, Bang Yunha)

1304
01:16:06,063 --> 01:16:07,262
That was so neat.

1305
01:16:12,832 --> 01:16:14,072
It was so neat.

1306
01:16:14,073 --> 01:16:16,042
- It was so powerful. - Yes.

1307
01:16:16,842 --> 01:16:18,243
She did so well.

1308
01:16:18,773 --> 01:16:20,712
It was refreshing, right?

1309
01:16:20,842 --> 01:16:22,743
She learned the basics well.

1310
01:16:28,222 --> 01:16:29,853
Bang Yunha,

1311
01:16:30,252 --> 01:16:32,823
I am so proud that we have similar names.

1312
01:16:34,892 --> 01:16:37,631
I am so proud that we have similar names.

1313
01:16:37,632 --> 01:16:41,762
(I am so proud that we have similar names.)

1314
01:16:41,863 --> 01:16:43,761
- I thought she lip-synced. - I know.

1315
01:16:43,762 --> 01:16:45,802
Did only Yunha lip-sync?

1316
01:16:46,132 --> 01:16:47,873
She sang so well.

1317
01:16:48,002 --> 01:16:49,472
Thank you.

1318
01:16:50,073 --> 01:16:53,242
As soon as Yunha began the performance,

1319
01:16:53,243 --> 01:16:56,382
- she shined. - That's right.

1320
01:16:56,512 --> 01:16:59,783
It was as if she was born to perform on the stage.

1321
01:16:59,882 --> 01:17:01,482
It really suited her.

1322
01:17:01,483 --> 01:17:02,823
It was a really good performance.

1323
01:17:03,623 --> 01:17:06,391
It was perfect. I enjoyed the performance.

1324
01:17:06,392 --> 01:17:09,563
Thank you.

1325
01:17:10,563 --> 01:17:12,192
- It's the highest praise. - Seriously.

1326
01:17:12,193 --> 01:17:13,363
It's totally the highest praise.

1327
01:17:13,733 --> 01:17:15,261
How did she sing the song live...

1328
01:17:15,262 --> 01:17:16,563
- from the beginning to the end? - Seriously.

1329
01:17:16,863 --> 01:17:18,172
I am intimidated.

1330
01:17:18,932 --> 01:17:20,002
(31st, Bang Yunha, 65th, Laura)

1331
01:17:24,842 --> 01:17:26,873
Thank you.

1332
01:17:27,243 --> 01:17:28,642
Thank you.

1333
01:17:28,983 --> 01:17:30,142
Thank you.

1334
01:17:33,882 --> 01:17:40,523
Younha said she was proud to have a similar name.

1335
01:17:41,363 --> 01:17:45,193
"I have lived in order to give this performance."

1336
01:17:45,432 --> 01:17:49,462
"I have worked hard to hear those words."

1337
01:17:49,703 --> 01:17:51,403
I had those thoughts.

1338
01:17:54,203 --> 01:17:55,801
- She did so well. - Thank you.

1339
01:17:55,802 --> 01:17:57,403
She performed "Sneakers."

1340
01:17:57,943 --> 01:18:00,113
- It suited her well. - The song suited her so well.

1341
01:18:00,512 --> 01:18:02,482
I think she did the best so far.

1342
01:18:02,483 --> 01:18:03,813
(15th, Korea, Oh Daeun)

1343
01:18:05,453 --> 01:18:06,783
This is no joke.

1344
01:18:09,882 --> 01:18:11,391
She is totally an all-rounder.

1345
01:18:11,392 --> 01:18:13,023
(15th, Korea, Oh Daeun)

1346
01:18:13,922 --> 01:18:16,023
When I compete with other older girls...

1347
01:18:16,092 --> 01:18:18,892
and give a live performance,

1348
01:18:19,193 --> 01:18:24,171
I think that I can do better than anyone.

1349
01:18:24,172 --> 01:18:26,103
(9th, Korea, Lim Seowon)

1350
01:18:27,432 --> 01:18:28,872
(Which participant are you wary of?)

1351
01:18:28,873 --> 01:18:32,113
I think I expected it to be Seowon...

1352
01:18:32,613 --> 01:18:35,113
because I saw a video of her online.

1353
01:18:35,182 --> 01:18:38,113
She was performing, and she did really great.

1354
01:18:38,252 --> 01:18:42,682
It can't be easy to fill the stage alone at that age,

1355
01:18:42,882 --> 01:18:44,193
but she does it.

1356
01:18:44,222 --> 01:18:45,993
It won't be easy to win against her.

1357
01:18:46,323 --> 01:18:50,592
I don't know how talented other participants are,

1358
01:18:50,722 --> 01:18:54,261
but I know how talented Seowon is.

1359
01:18:54,262 --> 01:18:56,802
So I'm quite afraid.

1360
01:18:57,462 --> 01:18:59,873
I definitely feel like I'll lose.

1361
01:19:00,273 --> 01:19:01,873
I want to avoid it if possible.

1362
01:19:02,373 --> 01:19:03,971
- Seowon. - Lim Seowon.

1363
01:19:03,972 --> 01:19:05,012
(A threat to everyone of all ranks)

1364
01:19:08,212 --> 01:19:10,613
There she is.

1365
01:19:12,252 --> 01:19:13,682
The best live singer.

1366
01:19:14,983 --> 01:19:16,222
- You can see her confidence. - Right.

1367
01:19:16,422 --> 01:19:18,592
She has that overwhelming presence.

1368
01:19:19,252 --> 01:19:21,063
- "Miss Trot!" - You're right.

1369
01:19:22,462 --> 01:19:26,461
(When she was 4 years old)

1370
01:19:26,462 --> 01:19:28,062
When I first started with trot,

1371
01:19:28,063 --> 01:19:32,272
I just thought it would be good to be versatile.

1372
01:19:32,273 --> 01:19:36,472
I did trot music, ballad songs, and musicals.

1373
01:19:36,642 --> 01:19:38,842
I thought I needed to make a choice to focus on one genre.

1374
01:19:40,073 --> 01:19:43,412
Being an idol singer is a mixture of everything.

1375
01:19:43,413 --> 01:19:45,051
That's what drew me into it.

1376
01:19:45,052 --> 01:19:46,182
(She wants to become an idol, the blend of all talents)

1377
01:19:46,413 --> 01:19:50,453
If you were to debut and take a role,

1378
01:19:51,292 --> 01:19:52,952
what would that be?

1379
01:19:52,953 --> 01:19:53,993
The center!

1380
01:19:56,023 --> 01:19:58,532
Oh, I see.

1381
01:19:58,533 --> 01:20:00,762
I cannot lie.

1382
01:20:03,403 --> 01:20:05,733
Are you confident for the 1-on-1 Battle?

1383
01:20:06,903 --> 01:20:09,502
That may differ based on who I'm against.

1384
01:20:09,903 --> 01:20:12,712
Does that mean you may not be confident against someone?

1385
01:20:12,913 --> 01:20:15,243
I'm pretty sure I'll still be confident.

1386
01:20:21,623 --> 01:20:24,292
(To be continued shortly)

1387
01:20:25,545 --> 01:20:29,316
("Atlantis Princess" by Lim Seowon)

1388
01:20:30,186 --> 01:20:31,356
Look at her expression.

1389
01:20:49,806 --> 01:20:51,106
She's a great dancer too.

1390
01:21:55,236 --> 01:21:57,335
What just happened?

1391
01:21:58,436 --> 01:22:00,676
I can't believe it.

1392
01:22:01,075 --> 01:22:02,745
She's a tough one.

1393
01:22:03,045 --> 01:22:05,476
- That gave me the chills. - What was that?

1394
01:22:05,676 --> 01:22:07,476
I want to cast her.

1395
01:22:08,486 --> 01:22:10,146
I want to cast her.

1396
01:22:11,115 --> 01:22:12,316
It's an honor.

1397
01:22:13,816 --> 01:22:14,926
She's amazing.

1398
01:22:15,556 --> 01:22:17,124
You even showed great expressions.

1399
01:22:17,125 --> 01:22:19,655
This is a song with really high notes.

1400
01:22:19,955 --> 01:22:21,194
How shall I put it?

1401
01:22:21,195 --> 01:22:22,825
Shall I say I can see her future?

1402
01:22:23,766 --> 01:22:24,936
Thank you.

1403
01:22:25,165 --> 01:22:26,735
Out of all contestants,

1404
01:22:26,736 --> 01:22:29,236
I think she's the only one who understands the camera angles.

1405
01:22:29,936 --> 01:22:31,476
- Thank you. - She's really good.

1406
01:22:36,205 --> 01:22:38,716
The winner of this battle is Lim Seowon.

1407
01:22:39,615 --> 01:22:40,846
Thank you.

1408
01:22:45,655 --> 01:22:48,356
My quiet heart suddenly started to pound.

1409
01:22:48,655 --> 01:22:50,325
I was worried about what is to come.

1410
01:22:56,526 --> 01:22:58,495
I feel like things will get even more competitive.

1411
01:22:58,966 --> 01:23:01,165
That's so cool!

1412
01:23:01,405 --> 01:23:03,735
There was a girl I really liked.

1413
01:23:03,736 --> 01:23:05,675
I remember her. Hyoyeon really liked her.

1414
01:23:05,676 --> 01:23:08,775
(The appearance of a global talent that surprised everyone?)

1415
01:23:08,776 --> 01:23:10,776
I believe I won't lose.

1416
01:23:11,075 --> 01:23:12,114
In terms of skills,

1417
01:23:12,115 --> 01:23:13,945
I believe I'm in the lead.

1418
01:23:14,146 --> 01:23:16,415
(A battle of the girls chasing their dreams)

1419
01:23:16,615 --> 01:23:17,954
(Who will become the winners of the 1-on-1 Battle?)

1420
01:23:17,955 --> 01:23:18,955
The final battle...

1421
01:23:18,956 --> 01:23:22,385
(Battle Week's final battle, Revenge Battle)

1422
01:23:22,386 --> 01:23:24,324
(Totally motivated)

1423
01:23:24,325 --> 01:23:25,454
Revenge?

1424
01:23:25,455 --> 01:23:26,794
(Winners...)

1425
01:23:26,795 --> 01:23:28,725
(versus Challengers)

1426
01:23:28,726 --> 01:23:30,766
Good luck.

1427
01:23:31,066 --> 01:23:33,694
(An unexpected performance of the girls who want revenge)

1428
01:23:33,695 --> 01:23:35,936
