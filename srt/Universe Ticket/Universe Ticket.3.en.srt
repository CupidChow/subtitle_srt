4
00:00:07,923 --> 00:00:10,963

(France)

8
00:00:16,804 --> 00:00:18,373
To be a part of a K-pop girl group,

9
00:00:18,374 --> 00:00:21,573
a total of 82 girls gathered in Korea.

10
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:23,943
Out of these 82 girls,

11
00:00:23,944 --> 00:00:27,678
only eight girls will head to the final global stage.

12
00:00:28,613 --> 00:00:34,322
Please get...

13
00:00:34,323 --> 00:00:35,853
Tickets to our dreams.

14
00:00:35,854 --> 00:00:37,193
Please get...

15

(Universe Ticket)

17
00:00:41,933 --> 00:00:45,233
(If I get another chance, I don't want to make a mistake.)

18
00:00:45,234 --> 00:00:46,604
(I want to show a proper performance.)

19
00:00:47,003 --> 00:00:48,034
(I felt wronged.)

20
00:00:48,704 --> 00:00:50,072
(I performed everything live.)

21
00:00:50,073 --> 00:00:52,644
(She performed separately for dancing and singing.)

22
00:00:52,903 --> 00:00:54,802
(I will definitely make sure...)

23
00:00:54,803 --> 00:00:57,043
(to win the next battle.)

24
00:00:57,613 --> 00:01:00,343
(The last hurdle of Battle Week)

25
00:01:00,344 --> 00:01:01,984
(Revenge Battle)

26
00:01:02,613 --> 00:01:03,654
Revenge?

27
00:01:04,154 --> 00:01:05,883
(The Revenge Battle will be a team battle.)

28
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:09,723
(Winners versus Challengers)

29
00:01:09,853 --> 00:01:11,223
Hold on.

30
00:01:11,353 --> 00:01:12,993
(I'm so excited.)

31
00:01:13,294 --> 00:01:16,333
(My head is full of spite.)

32
00:01:17,133 --> 00:01:20,434
(Revenge)

33
00:01:20,803 --> 00:01:22,403
(I love that title.)

34
00:01:22,404 --> 00:01:25,674
(There's a chance I can get back at someone.)

35
00:01:27,273 --> 00:01:29,174
(That revenge won't be easy.)

36
00:01:30,044 --> 00:01:31,374
(I won't lose twice.)

37
00:01:32,443 --> 00:01:33,814
(Bring it on.)

38
00:01:34,544 --> 00:01:35,784
I'm sorry.

39
00:01:36,713 --> 00:01:39,954
(Cute Challengers' "Tell Me" who dream of revenge)

40
00:01:40,053 --> 00:01:41,453
(There's no main dancer.)

41
00:01:41,454 --> 00:01:43,353
(There's no main vocalist either.)

42
00:01:44,124 --> 00:01:48,794
(Cute Winners' "TT" counterattack with ace members)

43
00:01:49,863 --> 00:01:51,462
(It was very successful.)

44
00:01:51,463 --> 00:01:53,803
The winner of the Cute concept is...

45
00:01:54,003 --> 00:01:57,534
(The first battle comes to an end with an overwhelming Winners win.)

46
00:01:57,874 --> 00:01:58,972
(Team...)

47
00:01:58,973 --> 00:02:00,472
(and me)

48
00:02:00,473 --> 00:02:04,174
(The number of participants who can advance to the Universe...)

49
00:02:04,343 --> 00:02:06,884
(Half of the winning team)

50
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:08,983
It's half of the winning team.

51
00:02:08,984 --> 00:02:12,182
(Only 20 members can make it to the Universe.)

52
00:02:12,183 --> 00:02:14,553
(Not everyone can survive.)

53
00:02:14,683 --> 00:02:16,123
(It's not a team battle.)

54
00:02:16,394 --> 00:02:18,824
(Should it be seen as an individual battle?)

55
00:02:18,993 --> 00:02:20,793
(The movements don't match toward the end.)

56
00:02:20,794 --> 00:02:24,734
(Jang Sua is quite slow when it comes to learning things.)

57
00:02:25,093 --> 00:02:28,104
(A battle between the girls who want to be in the top 20)

58
00:02:28,563 --> 00:02:31,134
("Why am I doing this?")

59
00:02:31,604 --> 00:02:33,843
(I really want to go home.)

60
00:02:37,113 --> 00:02:39,313
(A sudden act out of the blue by the girls?)

61
00:02:53,424 --> 00:02:56,463
(Episode 3: Tears)

62
00:02:56,764 --> 00:03:00,403
Enchanting Winners and Enchanting Challengers,

63
00:03:00,604 --> 00:03:02,373
please come up on stage.

64
00:03:02,634 --> 00:03:04,402
Enchanting.

65
00:03:04,403 --> 00:03:05,674
I'm really curious.

66
00:03:11,613 --> 00:03:12,742
- Hello. - Hello.

67
00:03:12,743 --> 00:03:14,243
(Enchanting Winners)

68
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:17,112
(Enchanting Challengers)

69
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:18,213
They're beautiful.

70
00:03:18,514 --> 00:03:20,224
Hello.

71
00:03:20,754 --> 00:03:22,093
They're so pretty.

72
00:03:22,993 --> 00:03:24,153
How enchanting.

73
00:03:27,894 --> 00:03:29,332
We can see what they're going for with their outfits.

74
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,463
Exactly.

75
00:03:30,933 --> 00:03:32,463
It's "Mister."

76
00:03:33,264 --> 00:03:36,532
(They chose KARA's song that started the Korean wave in Japan.)

77
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:40,574
(The highlight of "Mister" is the enchanting hip move.)

78
00:03:40,674 --> 00:03:42,272
One, two, three.

79
00:03:42,273 --> 00:03:45,043
- Hello... - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, boom it!

80
00:03:45,044 --> 00:03:47,682
- Hello... - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, boom it!

81
00:03:47,683 --> 00:03:50,253
- Hello. - Hello. We're...

82
00:03:50,254 --> 00:03:52,254
- Team "Mister." - Team "Mister."

83
00:03:52,623 --> 00:03:54,954
- Hello. We're... - What was that?

84
00:03:55,824 --> 00:03:57,324
I think they should do it again.

85
00:03:57,493 --> 00:03:59,363
- My goodness. - Did you work on that?

86
00:04:01,764 --> 00:04:02,764
In 2, 3.

87
00:04:02,765 --> 00:04:03,793
- We are so perfect. - We are so perfect.

88
00:04:03,794 --> 00:04:05,393
- We get a perfect score! - We get a perfect score!

89
00:04:05,394 --> 00:04:08,263
- Hello. We are Team "DIVA." - Hello. We are Team "DIVA."

90
00:04:08,264 --> 00:04:09,503
(Enchanting Challengers chose "DIVA" by After School.)

91
00:04:09,504 --> 00:04:10,603
"DIVA!"

92
00:04:10,604 --> 00:04:13,444
Challengers get a perfect score for the greeting.

93
00:04:14,704 --> 00:04:17,313
- Oh Yoona. - Yes.

94
00:04:17,314 --> 00:04:18,982
During the 1-on-1 Battle,

95
00:04:18,983 --> 00:04:21,113
you were the only one on this team to lose by a point.

96
00:04:21,114 --> 00:04:23,352
It was a close match as you lost 2 to 3.

97
00:04:23,353 --> 00:04:24,384
Right.

98
00:04:24,814 --> 00:04:26,223
(33rd Ahn Seungbi, 49th Oh Yoona)

99
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:31,423
(The 1-on-1 Battle was decided just by a single point.)

100
00:04:32,264 --> 00:04:36,463
(Oh Yoona lost after a close match.)

101
00:04:36,994 --> 00:04:39,704
(I felt wronged.)

102
00:04:39,864 --> 00:04:41,602
(I performed everything live.)

103
00:04:41,603 --> 00:04:45,874
(She performed separately for dancing and singing.)

104
00:04:45,944 --> 00:04:51,043
(I will definitely make sure to win the next battle.)

105
00:04:51,343 --> 00:04:54,144
(Reveal of the final battle)

106
00:04:54,483 --> 00:04:55,814
The Revenge Battle.

107
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:59,754
(A chance for revenge has come upon the Challengers.)

108
00:04:59,923 --> 00:05:02,793
(Hold on. I'm so excited.)

109
00:05:02,894 --> 00:05:04,093
I'm so excited.

110
00:05:04,194 --> 00:05:05,893
(Another girl dreams of revenge.)

111
00:05:05,894 --> 00:05:07,592
(This is it.)

112
00:05:07,593 --> 00:05:09,864
(Let me have my revenge.)

113
00:05:10,733 --> 00:05:13,363
The fact that I had a chance to get my revenge...

114
00:05:13,364 --> 00:05:15,833
motivated me with a bigger sense of passion.

115
00:05:16,673 --> 00:05:18,173
We must start an uprising.

116
00:05:19,504 --> 00:05:21,373
- We must get our revenge. - Right.

117
00:05:21,374 --> 00:05:22,842
(The Challengers are determined for revenge.)

118
00:05:22,843 --> 00:05:25,713
Do you remember who you're up against?

119
00:05:25,983 --> 00:05:27,342
I'm against Anxin.

120
00:05:27,343 --> 00:05:28,444
Anxin?

121
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:31,083
- She performed "Flower." - Right.

122
00:05:31,314 --> 00:05:33,053
She looks really cute.

123
00:05:33,054 --> 00:05:34,754
She's perfect for the cute concept.

124
00:05:35,254 --> 00:05:37,953
She used the chair and went like this.

125
00:05:37,954 --> 00:05:39,263
- Narumi? - Narumi?

126
00:05:39,264 --> 00:05:41,123
She went with the enchanting concept.

127
00:05:41,124 --> 00:05:42,694
- Enchanting. - Right.

128
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:45,292
I really have no idea what's to come.

129
00:05:45,293 --> 00:05:46,403
(While the Challengers predict the concept...)

130
00:05:46,504 --> 00:05:48,364
The songs will be revealed.

131
00:05:49,134 --> 00:05:51,134
"DIVA" by After School.

132
00:05:52,033 --> 00:05:53,043
"DIVA?"

133
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,744
"Mister" by KARA.

134
00:05:54,944 --> 00:05:56,712
- "Mister." - "Mister."

135
00:05:56,713 --> 00:06:00,113
- "Mister." - "Mister."

136
00:06:00,114 --> 00:06:01,513
- "Mister." - "Mister."

137
00:06:01,514 --> 00:06:04,054
(Everyone decides to choose "Mister" by KARA.)

138
00:06:04,413 --> 00:06:05,513
We'll win.

139
00:06:05,514 --> 00:06:07,283
- The results are obvious. - Yes.

140
00:06:07,884 --> 00:06:11,624
- Seungbi is feeling energetic. - Right.

141
00:06:12,293 --> 00:06:14,022
- Wait right there. - Let's go!

142
00:06:14,023 --> 00:06:15,422
- We will win! - We're on top!

143
00:06:15,423 --> 00:06:17,792
- We will win! - Wait right there.

144
00:06:17,793 --> 00:06:19,304
(Which girl will smile at the end of Battle Week?)

145
00:06:19,364 --> 00:06:21,462
Anxin.

146
00:06:21,463 --> 00:06:24,934
You don't seem like a match with the enchanting concept.

147
00:06:26,744 --> 00:06:27,972
She's so cute.

148
00:06:27,973 --> 00:06:31,144
How did you interpret the enchanting concept?

149
00:06:32,043 --> 00:06:35,144
To seduce everyone here,

150
00:06:35,343 --> 00:06:38,483
I chose the enchanting concept.

151
00:06:39,054 --> 00:06:41,422
(What do we do?)

152
00:06:41,423 --> 00:06:42,922
That was hilarious.

153
00:06:42,923 --> 00:06:45,593
(We're expectant to see unexpected charms through this battle.)

154
00:06:45,663 --> 00:06:47,063
(How will enchanting Anxin's "Mister" look like?)

155
00:06:47,064 --> 00:06:48,162
She's so cute.

156
00:06:48,163 --> 00:06:50,163
(How will enchanting Anxin's "Mister" look like?)

157
00:06:51,134 --> 00:06:53,532
Let's quickly decide on our parts.

158
00:06:53,533 --> 00:06:55,672
Does anyone want Part One?

159
00:06:55,673 --> 00:06:57,602
You do?

160
00:06:57,603 --> 00:06:59,203
- Is everyone okay with that? - Yes.

161
00:06:59,204 --> 00:07:01,772
- Then Seungbi will get that part. - Yes.

162
00:07:01,773 --> 00:07:03,614
Raise your hand if you want Part Two.

163
00:07:04,273 --> 00:07:06,443
All right then.

164
00:07:06,444 --> 00:07:08,613
"My heart keeps pounding."

165
00:07:08,614 --> 00:07:11,254
Let's hear this part.

166
00:07:11,454 --> 00:07:13,922
Can you ask for the song to be played again?

167
00:07:13,923 --> 00:07:16,123
She wants to listen to the song one more time.

168
00:07:16,124 --> 00:07:18,824
Right. She wants to listen to it again?

169
00:07:25,533 --> 00:07:26,963
Why is it so fast?

170
00:07:27,304 --> 00:07:28,603
I'll go first.

171
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:31,173
Okay. Yuri first.

172
00:07:33,074 --> 00:07:36,213
(Expressions and gestures full of confidence)

173
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,583
All right.

174
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,614
Anxin, next.

175
00:07:53,364 --> 00:07:54,663
It's okay.

176
00:07:56,494 --> 00:07:58,393
We still saw what it was like.

177
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,232
We'll start the vote.

178
00:08:00,233 --> 00:08:01,634
Let's put our heads down.

179
00:08:01,733 --> 00:08:04,003
We'll vote.

180
00:08:04,004 --> 00:08:07,004
Raise your hands for Yuri.

181
00:08:08,273 --> 00:08:09,514
You may put them down.

182
00:08:09,744 --> 00:08:12,543
Raise your hands for Anxin.

183
00:08:13,684 --> 00:08:14,883
You may put them down.

184
00:08:14,884 --> 00:08:17,152
Part Two...

185
00:08:17,153 --> 00:08:21,082
- will be given to Yuri. - Thank you.

186
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:24,193
- will be given to Yuri. - Thank you.

187
00:08:24,194 --> 00:08:29,663
(Anxin lost the part she wanted.)

188
00:08:32,634 --> 00:08:34,702
Here's the next part.

189
00:08:34,703 --> 00:08:38,003
Part Four will go to Xiaoyu.

190
00:08:38,004 --> 00:08:40,542
- Oh, me? Is that okay? - Yes.

191
00:08:40,543 --> 00:08:43,773
- Yes. - Part Seven will be given to me.

192
00:08:44,344 --> 00:08:48,113
Everyone else speaks Korean but I don't.

193
00:08:48,114 --> 00:08:49,812
I can also only speak a little bit of English.

194
00:08:49,813 --> 00:08:54,453
I couldn't get the part I wanted.

195
00:08:55,624 --> 00:08:57,854
(That night)

196
00:09:03,734 --> 00:09:09,403
(A place where the girls can speak their feelings)

197
00:09:25,014 --> 00:09:27,884
Hello. I'm Anxin.

198
00:09:28,923 --> 00:09:35,764
It's a bit disappointing that I couldn't get the part I wanted.

199
00:09:37,734 --> 00:09:41,063
But it's okay.

200
00:09:41,364 --> 00:09:45,133
This part might not have been a suitable one for me.

201
00:09:45,134 --> 00:09:48,442
It could've been because I was lacking for it.

202
00:09:48,443 --> 00:09:49,773
I will work even harder.

203
00:09:51,474 --> 00:09:54,683
(2 days before the Revenge Battle)

204
00:09:57,283 --> 00:09:59,354
All right. I'll show you the part.

205
00:09:59,384 --> 00:10:04,322
- Twice here. And swirl. - Swirl.

206
00:10:04,323 --> 00:10:06,864
(Peeking)

207
00:10:13,264 --> 00:10:15,464
Everyone learns the moves really quickly.

208
00:10:17,604 --> 00:10:19,644
In a blink of an eye, half of the first verse is gone.

209
00:10:22,004 --> 00:10:23,014
Wait.

210
00:10:23,474 --> 00:10:24,474
Like this.

211
00:10:24,744 --> 00:10:26,613
- Go like this and then do this. - I heard...

212
00:10:26,614 --> 00:10:30,413
how things were going for the other teams.

213
00:10:30,484 --> 00:10:33,724
And it seems like we're being too slow.

214
00:10:35,153 --> 00:10:39,662
(The other teams are almost done working on the choreography.)

215
00:10:39,663 --> 00:10:42,634
- Go like this. - I have a lot on my mind.

216
00:10:44,533 --> 00:10:47,604
It felt like we were a little off.

217
00:10:48,334 --> 00:10:49,974
So I was nervous.

218
00:10:50,203 --> 00:10:52,474
"Hey, there, mister." We're off the beat here.

219
00:10:53,443 --> 00:10:56,773
(Smile smile, just smiling to you)

220
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,253
(Anxin has a hard time pronouncing the lyrics.)

221
00:11:04,254 --> 00:11:06,224
- "I keep..." - "I keep..."

222
00:11:06,323 --> 00:11:08,952
- "Gaining a bit of confidence." - "Gaining a bit of confidence."

223
00:11:08,953 --> 00:11:11,792
(Yewon, the leader teaches them how to pronounce the lyrics.)

224
00:11:11,793 --> 00:11:15,494
You should be able to do it by yourself during the battle.

225
00:11:15,563 --> 00:11:17,363
Anxin, I know it's hard.

226
00:11:17,364 --> 00:11:18,562
But...

227
00:11:18,563 --> 00:11:19,933
you should try to memorize it.

228
00:11:20,464 --> 00:11:21,533
Okay.

229
00:11:24,104 --> 00:11:27,803
I keep falling behind while we practice.

230
00:11:29,344 --> 00:11:32,644
I often forget the lyrics and stop.

231
00:11:34,484 --> 00:11:37,584
(Anxin focuses on memorizing the lyrics alone.)

232
00:11:38,153 --> 00:11:44,124
I'm upset that I caused the other members trouble again.

233
00:11:45,594 --> 00:11:47,563
(That night, at the dorm)

234
00:11:48,023 --> 00:11:50,033
Some of us haven't even memorized the lyrics yet.

235
00:11:50,234 --> 00:11:53,263
Why is it so hard to memorize the lyrics?

236
00:11:53,264 --> 00:11:54,463
- This is serious. - I mean...

237
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:57,473
That's because they're from other countries.

238
00:11:57,474 --> 00:11:58,902
But still...

239
00:11:58,903 --> 00:12:00,843
But it must be only about...

240
00:12:00,844 --> 00:12:03,244
- 5 to 10 seconds at the longest. - They just need to memorize it.

241
00:12:04,043 --> 00:12:06,114
And they're supposed to sing the "all" part together,

242
00:12:06,484 --> 00:12:07,584
but they don't.

243
00:12:08,584 --> 00:12:11,053
They can't even memorize the dance moves.

244
00:12:11,283 --> 00:12:12,484
And they don't know the song.

245
00:12:13,384 --> 00:12:15,182
You must be frustrated.

246
00:12:15,183 --> 00:12:16,452
What if I don't get to do my thing?

247
00:12:16,453 --> 00:12:17,653
I understand.

248
00:12:19,023 --> 00:12:21,863
Today, when they were practicing the Korean song,

249
00:12:21,864 --> 00:12:25,094
they kept missing the beat and sang off-key.

250
00:12:25,663 --> 00:12:29,272
But that's what determines...

251
00:12:29,273 --> 00:12:31,903
the result of the battle.

252
00:12:32,803 --> 00:12:34,673
So I'm a little afraid.

253
00:12:36,744 --> 00:12:39,584
(1 day before the Revenge Battle)

254
00:12:40,144 --> 00:12:43,783
(They start practicing the lyrics early in the morning.)

255
00:12:49,053 --> 00:12:53,994
(Anxin works harder than anyone else not to cause her team trouble.)

256
00:12:54,724 --> 00:12:57,663
(The group dance is almost complete.)

257
00:12:58,793 --> 00:13:02,134
(Some people are dancing to "Mister?")

258
00:13:08,273 --> 00:13:09,273
(The girls are surprised to see the unexpected guests.)

259
00:13:09,274 --> 00:13:10,343
My goodness.

260
00:13:10,344 --> 00:13:11,843
Be careful.

261
00:13:11,844 --> 00:13:13,913
(Universe Icon, Chaeryeong and Yeji)

262
00:13:14,514 --> 00:13:15,942
(They're making a surprise visit to see how things are going.)

263
00:13:15,943 --> 00:13:17,384
- Hello. - Hello.

264
00:13:17,514 --> 00:13:19,114
Once you're ready,

265
00:13:19,653 --> 00:13:21,553
- please show us. - Hello.

266
00:13:22,484 --> 00:13:24,192
(They check Anxin's lyrics at the last minute.)

267
00:13:24,193 --> 00:13:25,223
Anxin, you should...

268
00:13:25,224 --> 00:13:26,692
(I can't memorize it.)

269
00:13:26,693 --> 00:13:27,693
You can do this.

270
00:13:27,694 --> 00:13:29,363
Just make sure to sing on the beat.

271
00:13:29,364 --> 00:13:32,394
(Yewon and Yuri work together to train her quickly.)

272
00:13:32,433 --> 00:13:33,903
I guess Anxin has a problem.

273
00:13:35,903 --> 00:13:37,803
- Good luck. - Good luck.

274
00:13:43,344 --> 00:13:44,474
They're good.

275
00:13:48,344 --> 00:13:50,653
(She ends up making a mistake at the part that she worried about.)

276
00:13:59,793 --> 00:14:01,662
- Thank you. - Thank you.

277
00:14:01,663 --> 00:14:03,293
Thank you for your hard work.

278
00:14:04,563 --> 00:14:06,464
- Anxin. - Yes.

279
00:14:07,063 --> 00:14:09,104
I noticed that you got...

280
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:11,133
the lyrics wrong.

281
00:14:11,134 --> 00:14:13,504
Was that because you were nervous?

282
00:14:13,673 --> 00:14:16,043
I didn't practice enough yet.

283
00:14:16,714 --> 00:14:18,214
You didn't practice enough?

284
00:14:18,474 --> 00:14:20,884
But the battle is tomorrow.

285
00:14:21,543 --> 00:14:23,214
You have...

286
00:14:23,484 --> 00:14:26,724
only 2 or 3 parts to sing.

287
00:14:26,923 --> 00:14:30,293
I think you need to practice more.

288
00:14:30,594 --> 00:14:32,553
You have to hurry and memorize it.

289
00:14:34,163 --> 00:14:36,663
Memorizing the lyrics is my biggest concern.

290
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:43,172
Wherever I go, I bring the lyrics with me...

291
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:45,834
so I can keep working on it.

292
00:14:46,374 --> 00:14:47,773
Yes, it's you

293
00:14:48,374 --> 00:14:50,043
Yes, it's you, mis...

294
00:14:50,214 --> 00:14:51,273
Mister

295
00:15:02,084 --> 00:15:04,322
(She recognizes her limits for the first time.)

296
00:15:04,323 --> 00:15:06,923
(The burden of getting it done in 3 days weighs her down.)

297
00:15:11,894 --> 00:15:12,963
I think I'm the eighth.

298
00:15:12,964 --> 00:15:16,733
(I think I'm the 8th on the team.)

299
00:15:16,734 --> 00:15:20,773
I don't sing or dance better than the other members.

300
00:15:21,573 --> 00:15:23,442
I don't think I will be able to survive.

301
00:15:23,443 --> 00:15:27,344
(I don't think I will be able to survive.)

302
00:15:30,484 --> 00:15:32,083
I like him

303
00:15:32,084 --> 00:15:34,282
I keep gaining a bit of confidence

304
00:15:34,283 --> 00:15:35,323
First,

305
00:15:35,384 --> 00:15:38,053
Enchanting Winners will perform.

306
00:15:38,094 --> 00:15:41,663
- Yes. - Please go down and stand by.

307
00:15:41,693 --> 00:15:42,834
Okay.

308
00:15:44,033 --> 00:15:45,493
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

309
00:15:45,494 --> 00:15:46,563
All right.

310
00:15:46,803 --> 00:15:48,432
Start.

311
00:15:48,433 --> 00:15:51,203
One, two, three, four, five, six, boom it!

312
00:15:51,433 --> 00:15:54,474
- They are so powerful. - Let's do this.

313
00:15:54,644 --> 00:15:56,474
- Good luck. - Good luck.

314
00:15:58,073 --> 00:16:00,013
- Good. - That's cool.

315
00:16:00,014 --> 00:16:01,143
- Good. - They're tall.

316
00:16:01,144 --> 00:16:02,214
That looks amazing.

317
00:16:02,313 --> 00:16:04,113
- Good start. - They're tall.

318
00:16:04,114 --> 00:16:05,183
They're tall.

319
00:16:06,084 --> 00:16:07,584
- They look pretty. - Yes.

320
00:16:07,754 --> 00:16:08,953
They're really pretty.

321
00:16:25,334 --> 00:16:26,474
How can they look so pretty?

322
00:16:39,884 --> 00:16:41,384
That's too bad.

323
00:17:20,193 --> 00:17:21,223
She's cute.

324
00:17:21,594 --> 00:17:22,693
There you go!

325
00:17:35,673 --> 00:17:37,243
- Oh, dear. - Oh, no.

326
00:18:11,473 --> 00:18:12,673
What kind of formation is this?

327
00:18:52,483 --> 00:18:55,683
- Thank you. - Thank you.

328
00:18:59,824 --> 00:19:01,423
- It's a little disappointing. - Yes.

329
00:19:02,693 --> 00:19:04,493
None of them is memorable.

330
00:19:17,013 --> 00:19:18,114
I don't think...

331
00:19:18,144 --> 00:19:21,242
you performed in good harmony.

332
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,413
It felt like...

333
00:19:23,354 --> 00:19:26,213
you didn't practice a lot together.

334
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:30,324
It looked like you all practiced individually.

335
00:19:31,723 --> 00:19:34,423
And many of you made mistakes with the lyrics.

336
00:19:35,723 --> 00:19:39,564
It felt like you failed to perform as a team.

337
00:19:41,933 --> 00:19:43,633
I could tell...

338
00:19:43,634 --> 00:19:45,733
Yewon and Seungbi were trying hard,

339
00:19:46,374 --> 00:19:47,442
but it didn't feel like...

340
00:19:47,443 --> 00:19:49,742
you were in harmony with the song.

341
00:19:49,743 --> 00:19:51,943
You were just working hard.

342
00:19:52,114 --> 00:19:57,614
I don't think you understood the concept perfectly.

343
00:19:59,753 --> 00:20:00,983
I appreciate your hard work.

344
00:20:01,124 --> 00:20:03,153
- Thank you. - Thank you.

345
00:20:08,824 --> 00:20:11,193
What do we do?

346
00:20:15,263 --> 00:20:17,233
What's wrong? Why are you crying?

347
00:20:23,274 --> 00:20:27,084
I thought the opposing team would win.

348
00:20:27,784 --> 00:20:28,983
I barely remembered the lyrics,

349
00:20:29,114 --> 00:20:30,953
I didn't sing well,

350
00:20:32,054 --> 00:20:34,452
and I didn't even remember the dance moves.

351
00:20:34,453 --> 00:20:35,784
So I was sad.

352
00:20:39,423 --> 00:20:42,364
I was very angry...

353
00:20:43,463 --> 00:20:45,193
at myself.

354
00:20:47,564 --> 00:20:50,703
And I was sad that I didn't take good care...

355
00:20:51,374 --> 00:20:53,344
of my team members.

356
00:20:55,403 --> 00:20:57,774
I'm really upset.

357
00:20:57,814 --> 00:21:00,384
(I'm really upset.)

358
00:21:00,644 --> 00:21:02,644
(Enchanting Challengers watched Enchanting Winners' performance.)

359
00:21:03,453 --> 00:21:05,252
(They feel more nervous as Enchanting Winners get bad reviews.)

360
00:21:05,253 --> 00:21:07,384
Take my heart

361
00:21:07,784 --> 00:21:09,253
Try the part, "I love my boy."

362
00:21:09,423 --> 00:21:10,922
I love my boy

363
00:21:10,923 --> 00:21:11,993
Okay.

364
00:21:14,094 --> 00:21:15,192
- Don't miss it. - Okay.

365
00:21:15,193 --> 00:21:17,093
There's no beat, so you have to be careful.

366
00:21:17,094 --> 00:21:18,094
Okay?

367
00:21:18,095 --> 00:21:21,202
They weren't dancing in straight lines,

368
00:21:21,203 --> 00:21:24,933
so I thought we'd be able to win if we did well.

369
00:21:25,134 --> 00:21:27,972
(3 days before the Revenge Battle)

370
00:21:27,973 --> 00:21:29,343
We have to do this with clenched teeth.

371
00:21:29,344 --> 00:21:31,243
We should be wearing pink.

372
00:21:31,473 --> 00:21:32,814
- Pink. - Right.

373
00:21:33,114 --> 00:21:35,544
This is Revenge Battle, you know.

374
00:21:35,784 --> 00:21:36,854
Hang on.

375
00:21:38,084 --> 00:21:39,153
Wait.

376
00:21:39,483 --> 00:21:40,624
I'm so excited.

377
00:21:41,253 --> 00:21:43,824
I really wanted to get my revenge.

378
00:21:44,394 --> 00:21:47,394
I think we have to finish the first verse today.

379
00:21:47,663 --> 00:21:53,403
I felt bad for those who voted for me to make me first place.

380
00:21:53,804 --> 00:21:56,433
(1-on-1 Battle. 1st Riel versus 54th Xiaoyu)

381
00:21:58,604 --> 00:22:01,002
(Riel lost with a score of 1 to 4 and became a Challenger.)

382
00:22:01,003 --> 00:22:03,774
I have to win this time.

383
00:22:04,074 --> 00:22:06,374
- Let's decide on the leader. - Who should it be?

384
00:22:06,713 --> 00:22:08,814
Does anyone want to be the leader?

385
00:22:15,653 --> 00:22:16,692
Shall I do it?

386
00:22:16,693 --> 00:22:18,153
- Yes. - Yes, good.

387
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:19,523
- Good. - I'll do it.

388
00:22:19,524 --> 00:22:20,864
- Thank you. - Thank you.

389
00:22:21,624 --> 00:22:23,663
I was upset that I lost.

390
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:25,933
This is it.

391
00:22:26,933 --> 00:22:28,233
Let me get my revenge.

392
00:22:29,163 --> 00:22:30,973
I really wanted to win.

393
00:22:31,173 --> 00:22:34,173
So I said I'd be the leader.

394
00:22:34,844 --> 00:22:36,573
We saw her during the 1-on-1 Battle,

395
00:22:36,574 --> 00:22:39,473
so we knew she danced really well.

396
00:22:41,713 --> 00:22:43,554
She taught us how to dance.

397
00:22:43,683 --> 00:22:45,814
And she encouraged us and cheered us up.

398
00:22:46,253 --> 00:22:49,683
I liked how well she led us.

399
00:22:52,253 --> 00:22:53,293
It's hot.

400
00:22:53,294 --> 00:22:55,223
- We should repeat over and over. - We should repeat over and over.

401
00:22:55,493 --> 00:22:57,933
Let's keep doing it until we pass out.

402
00:22:58,163 --> 00:23:01,403
I'll work really hard with clenched teeth...

403
00:23:02,134 --> 00:23:03,774
to be a winner.

404
00:23:04,134 --> 00:23:06,943
I'm so happy that the atmosphere of our team is so good.

405
00:23:07,804 --> 00:23:09,773
Would there be a team with a bad atmosphere?

406
00:23:09,774 --> 00:23:10,814
I don't know.

407
00:23:11,644 --> 00:23:13,613
I think Enchanting Winners have a lot of members from abroad.

408
00:23:13,614 --> 00:23:15,043
- Really? - So...

409
00:23:15,044 --> 00:23:17,854
they are not moving forward because of miscommunication.

410
00:23:18,753 --> 00:23:20,024
Are you serious?

411
00:23:20,253 --> 00:23:21,923
That's too bad. What can they do?

412
00:23:23,084 --> 00:23:24,353
They have to do well anyway.

413
00:23:24,354 --> 00:23:26,093
- You're right. - Meeting a good team is luck.

414
00:23:26,094 --> 00:23:27,693
(Meeting a good team is luck.)

415
00:23:28,124 --> 00:23:30,534
(2 days before the Revenge Battle)

416
00:23:31,364 --> 00:23:35,002
(Enchanting Challengers are busy getting a dance lesson.)

417
00:23:35,003 --> 00:23:36,303
Shall we do it again slowly?

418
00:23:36,304 --> 00:23:38,433
(They do the moves slowly again to the beat.)

419
00:23:39,173 --> 00:23:40,543
(Jeong Huigyeong of Challengers)

420
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,544
(Look at my heart...)

421
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,814
- Take my heart - Take my heart

422
00:23:46,274 --> 00:23:49,743
(They keep making mistakes.)

423
00:23:50,413 --> 00:23:54,824
We were in a situation where we needed to move forward quickly.

424
00:23:58,854 --> 00:23:59,992
But there were members...

425
00:23:59,993 --> 00:24:04,233
who kept making mistakes and fell behind.

426
00:24:05,364 --> 00:24:07,804
I found it frustrating.

427
00:24:08,433 --> 00:24:10,874
I have to win this time.

428
00:24:12,134 --> 00:24:14,203
- I'll tell you about my love - Okay.

429
00:24:15,243 --> 00:24:16,403
I realized...

430
00:24:17,544 --> 00:24:20,044
we shouldn't make things easy when we practiced.

431
00:24:21,913 --> 00:24:25,513
- Hello. - Hello.

432
00:24:29,753 --> 00:24:32,053
- We talked about this a lot. - Yes.

433
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:36,193
I think we will have to change your parts completely.

434
00:24:38,963 --> 00:24:41,103
The parts are too divided.

435
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:42,303
(They rearranged their parts to build team synergy.)

436
00:24:42,304 --> 00:24:44,133
I think we should put some of them together.

437
00:24:44,134 --> 00:24:45,334
- Okay. - So...

438
00:24:45,503 --> 00:24:47,803
Jinyeong will do this part,

439
00:24:47,804 --> 00:24:50,343
"Promise me that you'll look at me."

440
00:24:50,344 --> 00:24:51,973
- Okay. - And...

441
00:24:52,774 --> 00:24:57,153
(They check the main vocal part again.)

442
00:24:57,513 --> 00:24:58,983
All right. For this part...

443
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:03,182
- Yui. - Yes.

444
00:25:03,183 --> 00:25:04,722
Can you give this a try?

445
00:25:04,723 --> 00:25:05,794
- Yes. - All right.

446
00:25:06,763 --> 00:25:10,594
(Idota Yui tries singing the main vocal part.)

447
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:13,864
Good. That's it.

448
00:25:14,134 --> 00:25:17,303
Then the rest of the members will go, "Tonight, tomorrow night."

449
00:25:17,304 --> 00:25:18,333
Okay?

450
00:25:18,334 --> 00:25:19,334
Yes.

451
00:25:19,335 --> 00:25:22,804
We changed all our parts.

452
00:25:23,173 --> 00:25:24,743
Completely.

453
00:25:25,074 --> 00:25:27,583
I was upset that I got fewer parts,

454
00:25:27,584 --> 00:25:30,854
but I understand that it's for the team's sake.

455
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:34,983
(They practice their new parts again.)

456
00:25:35,983 --> 00:25:40,693
(Their voices become unstable with the new parts.)

457
00:25:41,364 --> 00:25:44,763
(Part 8: Idota Yui)

458
00:25:45,094 --> 00:25:47,063
(Part 1: Jeon Jinyeong)

459
00:25:47,064 --> 00:25:48,503
(Promise me that you'll look at me.)

460
00:25:49,463 --> 00:25:53,133
I got more parts to sing.

461
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:55,403
So I was a little worried.

462
00:25:58,544 --> 00:26:01,182
(The leader, Jinyeong, keeps making mistakes.)

463
00:26:01,183 --> 00:26:04,313
We trusted Jinyeong, but she kept making mistakes.

464
00:26:04,314 --> 00:26:07,453
That swayed me a lot.

465
00:26:08,524 --> 00:26:09,554
What do we do?

466
00:26:13,723 --> 00:26:15,364
Let's not eat today.

467
00:26:15,763 --> 00:26:17,134
We have to practice.

468
00:26:17,733 --> 00:26:19,134
I don't deserve to eat.

469
00:26:19,294 --> 00:26:21,463
We don't deserve to eat.

470
00:26:23,034 --> 00:26:26,774
We have to get things done within only three days.

471
00:26:27,104 --> 00:26:33,213
(They have to memorize their parts within a short period of time.)

472
00:26:36,614 --> 00:26:38,354
This sounds a lot better.

473
00:26:43,923 --> 00:26:45,923
Why? What's wrong?

474
00:26:46,124 --> 00:26:48,564
Why? No, you did well. It's all right.

475
00:26:49,794 --> 00:26:52,192
- You were good. - Don't cry.

476
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:53,462
(The changed parts make her burst into tears.)

477
00:26:53,463 --> 00:26:54,803
It's all right.

478
00:26:54,804 --> 00:26:56,003
Don't cry.

479
00:26:56,233 --> 00:26:57,402
(They feel bad that they are being burdens on each other.)

480
00:26:57,403 --> 00:27:00,144
Come on. Don't cry.

481
00:27:02,403 --> 00:27:04,073
Did we lose? That's not it.

482
00:27:04,074 --> 00:27:05,712
- Don't be like that. - We will win.

483
00:27:05,713 --> 00:27:07,913
- I'll get you some tissue. - We didn't lose yet.

484
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:11,653
- I didn't do well. - What? No.

485
00:27:12,653 --> 00:27:15,153
- Why is everyone crying? - Why...

486
00:27:16,923 --> 00:27:18,594
- What? - Hang on.

487
00:27:18,824 --> 00:27:20,192
Oh, my. What do I do?

488
00:27:20,193 --> 00:27:21,364
What should I do?

489
00:27:21,864 --> 00:27:23,063
It's all right.

490
00:27:23,064 --> 00:27:25,864
We just need to practice hard tomorrow.

491
00:27:27,804 --> 00:27:28,863
Don't cry.

492
00:27:28,864 --> 00:27:31,334
(Challengers are becoming stronger to win the battle.)

493
00:27:31,574 --> 00:27:32,574
Poke, and...

494
00:27:32,575 --> 00:27:34,773
(1 day before the Revenge Battle)

495
00:27:34,774 --> 00:27:36,403
Lower your body now.

496
00:27:37,144 --> 00:27:38,313
Seven and eight.

497
00:27:38,314 --> 00:27:41,314
(Leader Jinyeong leads the members during the practice.)

498
00:27:41,713 --> 00:27:45,213
Sua, your timing to swing your arm is a little off.

499
00:27:46,584 --> 00:27:48,053
Try it again.

500
00:27:48,054 --> 00:27:50,553
(Sua's moves are a little different.)

501
00:27:50,554 --> 00:27:52,753
It becomes off as it goes on.

502
00:27:53,423 --> 00:27:56,793
We have to let our team win in order for us to win.

503
00:27:56,794 --> 00:27:59,133
So I helped Sua a lot.

504
00:27:59,134 --> 00:28:01,463
Good. Do it slowly.

505
00:28:02,703 --> 00:28:04,874
We were determined to win,

506
00:28:05,334 --> 00:28:08,243
and it made us have good teamwork.

507
00:28:08,644 --> 00:28:11,314
(Sua practiced hard with the members' help.)

508
00:28:11,614 --> 00:28:14,213
I want to steel myself and work hard...

509
00:28:15,413 --> 00:28:17,313
so I will do things right...

510
00:28:17,314 --> 00:28:18,784
without making any mistakes.

511
00:28:21,683 --> 00:28:22,784
You...

512
00:28:23,824 --> 00:28:26,192
You go like, "Diva, diva."

513
00:28:26,193 --> 00:28:27,263
What?

514
00:28:27,394 --> 00:28:29,624
(Enchanting Challengers supported each other in the short time.)

515
00:28:29,763 --> 00:28:30,863
Do this.

516
00:28:30,864 --> 00:28:34,364
(Enchanting Challengers supported each other in the short time.)

517
00:28:35,034 --> 00:28:38,634
I will win with clenched teeth no matter what...

518
00:28:39,104 --> 00:28:41,144
and get my revenge.

519
00:28:42,443 --> 00:28:44,512
Our wish to get our revenge...

520
00:28:44,513 --> 00:28:48,513
made us work even harder.

521
00:28:49,183 --> 00:28:52,554
I will get my revenge and smash them.

522
00:28:53,114 --> 00:28:55,024
- They look cool. - That's cool.

523
00:28:57,923 --> 00:29:01,993
("DIVA" by After School)

524
00:29:15,804 --> 00:29:16,844
That's it.

525
00:29:28,324 --> 00:29:29,453
What? They are so good.

526
00:30:38,923 --> 00:30:40,294
Let's go!

527
00:31:42,223 --> 00:31:44,953
- They did well. - They were great.

528
00:31:45,854 --> 00:31:47,024
That was great.

529
00:31:47,094 --> 00:31:48,923
- They were great. Yes. - I got goosebumps.

530
00:31:54,864 --> 00:31:57,134
- Thank you. - Thank you.

531
00:31:58,233 --> 00:31:59,834
- They were so good. - Oh, my.

532
00:32:01,144 --> 00:32:02,574
The Challengers killed it.

533
00:32:03,844 --> 00:32:05,073
Their teamwork was much better...

534
00:32:05,074 --> 00:32:06,513
- than the Winners. - Indeed.

535
00:32:07,144 --> 00:32:09,243
- Thank you. - Thank you.

536
00:32:12,054 --> 00:32:13,054
Amazing.

537
00:32:13,183 --> 00:32:15,683
I would like to give a huge compliment to Yoona.

538
00:32:15,824 --> 00:32:17,693
Thank you.

539
00:32:18,153 --> 00:32:21,123
Despite the fact that this kind of concept didn't necessarily...

540
00:32:21,124 --> 00:32:23,094
suit your natural style or anything,

541
00:32:23,324 --> 00:32:25,762
you diligently worked to understand...

542
00:32:25,763 --> 00:32:28,963
and study the concept from start to finish.

543
00:32:29,203 --> 00:32:32,303
You kept working hard to the end not to interrupt the flow.

544
00:32:32,304 --> 00:32:34,243
I could clearly see that in your performance.

545
00:32:34,374 --> 00:32:37,412
In my opinion, you had the center position...

546
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:39,942
for this battle. You were so great that you made me think that.

547
00:32:39,943 --> 00:32:41,784
- Thank you. - Well done.

548
00:32:46,114 --> 00:32:48,253
Sua and Yui.

549
00:32:51,693 --> 00:32:54,723
You guys were incredibly adorable.

550
00:32:57,163 --> 00:33:00,564
Whenever you stepped forward to sing and dance,

551
00:33:00,733 --> 00:33:03,534
Se Jeong who was next to me couldn't stop giggling.

552
00:33:03,663 --> 00:33:06,903
She kept saying, "Oh, my." She couldn't stop adoring you guys.

553
00:33:07,304 --> 00:33:09,672
But as for this battle,

554
00:33:09,673 --> 00:33:12,814
I must be objective when giving my feedback.

555
00:33:12,913 --> 00:33:15,482
Since you guys are new,

556
00:33:15,483 --> 00:33:16,742
your performance came across as a breath of fresh air.

557
00:33:16,743 --> 00:33:20,283
But you might be at a disadvantage as the show progresses.

558
00:33:20,284 --> 00:33:23,524
I don't think this will work on us next time.

559
00:33:24,723 --> 00:33:27,223
You will need to do something about that.

560
00:33:27,993 --> 00:33:30,492
I thought that the Japanese Challengers...

561
00:33:30,493 --> 00:33:33,193
did a great job in this battle.

562
00:33:33,364 --> 00:33:35,863
Let me start with Yui.

563
00:33:35,864 --> 00:33:39,232
You said you weren't much interested in becoming a main vocalist.

564
00:33:39,233 --> 00:33:41,673
But you still did a great job, pulling off your parts.

565
00:33:41,844 --> 00:33:43,544
Gosh. Good work.

566
00:33:44,044 --> 00:33:46,073
- And... Goodness. - Gosh.

567
00:33:46,074 --> 00:33:47,942
- It's okay. - Yui.

568
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:48,982
(She overcame the pressure of being the main vocalist.)

569
00:33:48,983 --> 00:33:51,213
- Well done. - You were great.

570
00:33:52,584 --> 00:33:55,554
She's crying because her hard work was recognized.

571
00:33:55,683 --> 00:33:57,854
- And Honma Yuriko. - Yes.

572
00:33:58,153 --> 00:34:00,193
I thought you were Korean.

573
00:34:00,493 --> 00:34:03,663
It means that your pronunciation was perfect,

574
00:34:03,794 --> 00:34:06,032
and you also stood out during the performance too.

575
00:34:06,033 --> 00:34:07,303
Thank you.

576
00:34:08,203 --> 00:34:12,103
Jinyeong. Actually, in my opinion,

577
00:34:12,104 --> 00:34:14,103
it was only possible that your teammates were able...

578
00:34:14,104 --> 00:34:17,644
to cover up their weaknesses thanks to your help.

579
00:34:17,843 --> 00:34:20,242
I didn't get the vibe that you were trying to stand out alone.

580
00:34:20,243 --> 00:34:23,044
I felt that you were truly trying to be a good leader for them.

581
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:25,854
- I wasn't trying to make you cry. - Oh, no.

582
00:34:26,013 --> 00:34:27,323
Being a leader is tough.

583
00:34:28,754 --> 00:34:29,754
Right.

584
00:34:29,953 --> 00:34:34,362
So I think the rest of the team was lucky to have met Jinyeong...

585
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:36,124
as their leader.

586
00:34:36,223 --> 00:34:40,092
As a leader, she was able to help everyone's strength shine.

587
00:34:40,093 --> 00:34:43,064
I wanted to tell you that you did a great job.

588
00:34:43,834 --> 00:34:45,303
That's such high praise.

589
00:34:45,504 --> 00:34:47,073
Totally. It's such high praise.

590
00:34:47,703 --> 00:34:49,943
I really enjoyed your performance. Good work.

591
00:34:49,944 --> 00:34:52,214
- Thank you. - Thank you.

592
00:34:54,183 --> 00:34:57,484
Winners for the Enchanting concept, please come up to the stage.

593
00:35:06,194 --> 00:35:09,263
It must have been tough. Everyone is crying.

594
00:35:09,424 --> 00:35:12,032
It's really agonizing to be in that situation. Seriously.

595
00:35:12,033 --> 00:35:13,432
- You speak from experience. - Right.

596
00:35:13,433 --> 00:35:14,734
You're amazing.

597
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:16,862
How did you get through that to be sitting here now?

598
00:35:16,863 --> 00:35:17,973
You're amazing.

599
00:35:19,504 --> 00:35:21,603
Here are the battle results.

600
00:35:21,604 --> 00:35:22,803
(The Enchanting Revenge Battle results get revealed.)

601
00:35:22,944 --> 00:35:24,944
The winner of the Enchanting concept is...

602
00:35:26,413 --> 00:35:28,113
(Enchanting Winners)

603
00:35:28,383 --> 00:35:29,813
Had I performed well,

604
00:35:29,814 --> 00:35:33,413
I wouldn't have had regrets about my performance.

605
00:35:33,854 --> 00:35:36,153
But we still did our best.

606
00:35:36,154 --> 00:35:39,654
I thought we could beat the Challengers.

607
00:35:40,663 --> 00:35:42,464
I was confident.

608
00:35:42,694 --> 00:35:44,493
But I kept feeling anxious because...

609
00:35:45,194 --> 00:35:46,734
I couldn't be certain.

610
00:35:49,203 --> 00:35:51,833
It's the Enchanting Challengers.

611
00:35:51,834 --> 00:35:55,003
(The Enchanting Challengers win the Revenge Battle.)

612
00:35:55,004 --> 00:35:56,373
Good job.

613
00:35:56,374 --> 00:35:58,714
- Thank you. - Thank you.

614
00:36:01,913 --> 00:36:03,314
With a score of 5 to 0,

615
00:36:04,354 --> 00:36:07,484
Team Enchanting Challengers takes the win.

616
00:36:07,854 --> 00:36:11,194
- Thank you. - Thank you.

617
00:36:13,093 --> 00:36:14,223
Do you want a hug?

618
00:36:14,593 --> 00:36:16,294
- Thank you. - Thank you.

619
00:36:19,363 --> 00:36:21,662
They got to choose neither the team...

620
00:36:21,663 --> 00:36:22,833
nor the song, but they won.

621
00:36:22,834 --> 00:36:24,234
Right. Exactly.

622
00:36:24,573 --> 00:36:25,604
They're impressive.

623
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:27,972
This is the Revenge Battle for a reason.

624
00:36:27,973 --> 00:36:29,274
- Right. - Yes.

625
00:36:29,404 --> 00:36:31,213
Everyone ought to experience hardships.

626
00:36:31,214 --> 00:36:33,314
You're right. That's true.

627
00:36:33,413 --> 00:36:36,183
Hardships make you determined and try harder.

628
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,512
Winners, please wait for...

629
00:36:40,513 --> 00:36:42,723
the Unicorn Ticketing that will happen soon.

630
00:36:43,323 --> 00:36:46,222
All members of the losing team must earn tickets from the fans...

631
00:36:46,223 --> 00:36:48,793
to be able to advance to the Universe.

632
00:36:48,794 --> 00:36:49,862
(They must win an opportunity to advance.)

633
00:36:49,863 --> 00:36:51,693
I thank all of you for your hard work.

634
00:36:51,694 --> 00:36:53,993
- Thank you. - Thank you.

635
00:36:57,573 --> 00:36:58,973
- Thank you. - Gosh.

636
00:36:59,334 --> 00:37:01,503
We were teamed up because we lost the 1-on-1 Battle.

637
00:37:01,504 --> 00:37:04,242
And this was my first victory.

638
00:37:04,243 --> 00:37:07,214
- It gave me this sense of thrill. - Well done.

639
00:37:07,413 --> 00:37:10,513
- Right. - It felt like I was dreaming.

640
00:37:10,714 --> 00:37:13,853
I remembered all the hard work I did for the past three days.

641
00:37:13,854 --> 00:37:18,223
Seriously. It made me tear up.

642
00:37:19,493 --> 00:37:21,523
I got to take revenge on the other team.

643
00:37:21,524 --> 00:37:24,133
Winning hit the spot.

644
00:37:24,263 --> 00:37:26,394
I also felt proud of myself.

645
00:37:26,834 --> 00:37:27,963
I was happy.

646
00:37:27,964 --> 00:37:29,604
(I was happy.)

647
00:37:29,633 --> 00:37:33,632
Pure Winners. Pure Challengers.

648
00:37:33,633 --> 00:37:35,104
Please come up to the stage.

649
00:37:36,144 --> 00:37:37,673
(Pure Winners versus Pure Challengers)

650
00:37:37,674 --> 00:37:39,374
- Gosh. - Yes.

651
00:37:40,374 --> 00:37:41,843
You guys look beautiful!

652
00:37:42,243 --> 00:37:43,282
How beautiful.

653
00:37:43,283 --> 00:37:44,854
- They look so pure. - How pretty.

654
00:37:46,214 --> 00:37:47,353
How pure.

655
00:37:47,354 --> 00:37:49,084
(Pure Challengers)

656
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:52,223
- Hello. - Hello.

657
00:37:52,394 --> 00:37:54,464
- How beautiful. - Gosh.

658
00:37:54,593 --> 00:37:56,523
- Goodness. They look so pure. - Oh, my.

659
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:57,762
They look so pretty.

660
00:37:57,763 --> 00:37:59,564
Gosh. They look so pure.

661
00:37:59,663 --> 00:38:02,162
Let's hear your introductions first.

662
00:38:02,163 --> 00:38:03,633
Winners, you can start.

663
00:38:08,044 --> 00:38:10,174
Gosh. They prepared an introduction.

664
00:38:10,814 --> 00:38:11,814
Hey.

665
00:38:12,044 --> 00:38:13,073
- Yes? - Yes?

666
00:38:14,283 --> 00:38:15,413
- Yes? - Yes?

667
00:38:18,154 --> 00:38:19,214
In 2, 3.

668
00:38:19,754 --> 00:38:20,822
In 2, 3.

669
00:38:20,823 --> 00:38:22,452
- Hello. - Hello.

670
00:38:22,453 --> 00:38:25,253
This song is the symbol of purity. We're the Pure Winners.

671
00:38:25,254 --> 00:38:27,592
- We're Team "Into the New World." - We're Team "Into the New World."

672
00:38:27,593 --> 00:38:29,193
I see. "Into the New World."

673
00:38:29,194 --> 00:38:30,663
Gosh. That's a masterpiece.

674
00:38:31,493 --> 00:38:33,632
(It's the debut song of Girls' Generation, )

675
00:38:33,633 --> 00:38:36,433
(the girl group Unicorn Hyoyeon belongs to.)

676
00:38:38,604 --> 00:38:44,073
(A must-practice song for trainees that want to be in girl groups)

677
00:38:46,044 --> 00:38:47,742
(How will they reinterpret the song?)

678
00:38:47,743 --> 00:38:48,783
In 2, 3.

679
00:38:49,913 --> 00:38:52,282
- Hello. We are... - Hello. We are...

680
00:38:52,283 --> 00:38:53,484
Ah-choo

681
00:38:53,953 --> 00:38:57,123
- Pollen is surrounding my heart - Pollen is surrounding my heart

682
00:38:57,124 --> 00:39:00,593
We'll take the victorious pollen. We're Team Pure Challengers.

683
00:39:01,723 --> 00:39:04,933
(It's the most representative song of Lovelyz.)

684
00:39:05,993 --> 00:39:09,863
(The song emphasizes the girlish charms.)

685
00:39:10,163 --> 00:39:12,334
(How will their version of "Ah-Choo" look?)

686
00:39:12,404 --> 00:39:14,572
- I have a question for you, Yunha. - Yes.

687
00:39:14,573 --> 00:39:15,742
During the rehearsal,

688
00:39:15,743 --> 00:39:17,242
you watched your opposing team's performance.

689
00:39:17,243 --> 00:39:18,573
What did you think?

690
00:39:19,544 --> 00:39:21,283
"I think we can beat them."

691
00:39:23,714 --> 00:39:24,814
It was short but had a punch.

692
00:39:27,013 --> 00:39:28,223
She's scary.

693
00:39:31,794 --> 00:39:33,293
Yes, "Into the New World."

694
00:39:33,294 --> 00:39:34,524
(3 days before the Revenge Battle)

695
00:39:35,964 --> 00:39:37,564
Everyone is Korean. Awesome.

696
00:39:38,964 --> 00:39:41,933
(They begin with an advantage as communication won't be an issue.)

697
00:39:42,334 --> 00:39:46,033
I was confident that we wouldn't lose.

698
00:39:46,104 --> 00:39:47,173
Let's hear from everyone...

699
00:39:47,174 --> 00:39:50,072
and go over the parts they all want.

700
00:39:50,073 --> 00:39:51,742
- Let's clear the overlapping ones. - Yes.

701
00:39:51,743 --> 00:39:53,343
- Yes. Let's do that. - Okay.

702
00:39:53,444 --> 00:39:55,484
Please raise your hand if you want the sixth part.

703
00:39:55,783 --> 00:39:57,282
Two of you. Great.

704
00:39:57,283 --> 00:39:59,513
Why don't you sing it? Okay.

705
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:04,084
(Candidate 1 for Part 6, Lee Huran)

706
00:40:05,493 --> 00:40:08,394
(Candidate 2 for Part 6, Jung Jiwon)

707
00:40:09,593 --> 00:40:10,894
Wait. I don't know the notes for that part.

708
00:40:11,734 --> 00:40:16,033
(She wants the part, but she doesn't know the notes.)

709
00:40:18,303 --> 00:40:20,533
They're lower than that. The notes are lower than you think.

710
00:40:20,633 --> 00:40:22,703
- They're lower. - Your soft

711
00:40:22,973 --> 00:40:25,713
Your soft breath

712
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:27,314
- That's it. - Yes.

713
00:40:27,644 --> 00:40:28,713
All right.

714
00:40:28,714 --> 00:40:32,883
Please raise your hands if you want Huran to take Part Six.

715
00:40:34,924 --> 00:40:37,523
(Huran gets the majority of the votes.)

716
00:40:37,524 --> 00:40:38,992
The sixth part...

717
00:40:38,993 --> 00:40:41,524
- will go to Huran. - Thank you.

718
00:40:42,394 --> 00:40:45,132
I thought I could express myself the best with the part.

719
00:40:45,133 --> 00:40:46,294
I wanted the part.

720
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:50,564
Raise your hands if you want Jiwon to take the part.

721
00:40:53,674 --> 00:40:55,174
The first part...

722
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,144
will go to Yunha.

723
00:40:57,714 --> 00:40:59,444
- She'll take the part. - Gosh.

724
00:40:59,944 --> 00:41:01,083
The fourth part...

725
00:41:01,084 --> 00:41:03,112
- will go to Sooin. - What a relief.

726
00:41:03,113 --> 00:41:04,314
Thank you.

727
00:41:06,254 --> 00:41:08,623
- The leader and the main vocalist. - I can't wait to work with you all.

728
00:41:08,624 --> 00:41:09,853
- You look great. - Thank you.

729
00:41:09,854 --> 00:41:11,323
- The main vocalist. - Thank you.

730
00:41:11,493 --> 00:41:13,052
It goes to Gyoryeon.

731
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:15,023
Thank you. I'll do my best.

732
00:41:15,024 --> 00:41:16,822
- You got this. - Thank you.

733
00:41:16,823 --> 00:41:18,694
I mean, look at her. That's how she'll start.

734
00:41:18,763 --> 00:41:20,734
I tried out all the parts.

735
00:41:21,033 --> 00:41:24,733
I felt that I wasn't good enough, and my style didn't suit the song.

736
00:41:24,734 --> 00:41:26,033
I just took the part that no one took.

737
00:41:26,533 --> 00:41:28,073
- Only we don't have any part. - You don't have any part, right?

738
00:41:28,104 --> 00:41:29,603
- Right. - We have some parts left.

739
00:41:29,604 --> 00:41:31,743
(Heo Sunbin also doesn't have any part yet.)

740
00:41:31,913 --> 00:41:33,213
Which part do you want?

741
00:41:33,214 --> 00:41:35,313
- The ninth part. - Okay. Take that one.

742
00:41:35,314 --> 00:41:36,543
- I'll take the seventh part. - Are you okay?

743
00:41:36,544 --> 00:41:37,952
- Jiwon will take the seventh part. - Yes.

744
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:40,053
Then Sunbin will take the ninth part.

745
00:41:40,553 --> 00:41:41,723
- Okay. - We're done.

746
00:41:42,053 --> 00:41:43,254
- Let's do this. - It suited Yunha better.

747
00:41:44,223 --> 00:41:47,863
(They begin practicing the choreography right away.)

748
00:41:48,194 --> 00:41:49,223
- This one. - One.

749
00:41:50,223 --> 00:41:51,334
How...

750
00:41:52,863 --> 00:41:55,163
- You don't have to move that much. - Me? Okay.

751
00:41:55,533 --> 00:41:57,203
- Right. That's enough. - Okay.

752
00:41:57,973 --> 00:42:00,503
- Five, six, seven, eight. - She's moving too much to the side.

753
00:42:00,504 --> 00:42:01,604
- Me? - Yes.

754
00:42:01,843 --> 00:42:03,504
- No need to move to the side. - Okay.

755
00:42:03,944 --> 00:42:05,842
If you stand in front of me...

756
00:42:05,843 --> 00:42:08,013
So if I can't see the camera, you'll block everyone here.

757
00:42:09,144 --> 00:42:12,012
(She's unable to be on camera due to Jiwon's wrong movement.)

758
00:42:12,013 --> 00:42:14,153
The three of us in the back won't be on camera then.

759
00:42:14,154 --> 00:42:15,723
- Don't move too much to the side. - Okay.

760
00:42:16,053 --> 00:42:17,924
- Let's try one more time. - Okay.

761
00:42:20,294 --> 00:42:24,263
I didn't think that the score from the 1-on-1 Battle mattered.

762
00:42:24,964 --> 00:42:26,193
(Kwon Chaewon, 2nd, Jeon Jieun, 42nd)

763
00:42:26,194 --> 00:42:30,303
(It was a complete victory with a score of 5 to 0.)

764
00:42:30,564 --> 00:42:32,933
Your lacking skills shouldn't be apparent on the stage.

765
00:42:33,674 --> 00:42:35,104
You can't let people see them.

766
00:42:35,604 --> 00:42:38,714
Do the two of you want to continue going in this line of work?

767
00:42:40,044 --> 00:42:44,084
(The Unicorns gave her the hard truth.)

768
00:42:44,913 --> 00:42:48,053
It's true that I am under constant pressure.

769
00:42:48,624 --> 00:42:50,553
I want to prepare for this battle to the best I can.

770
00:42:50,823 --> 00:42:53,624
I want to show them what I'm good at.

771
00:42:54,053 --> 00:42:57,293
I want them to think that I must have had a reason...

772
00:42:57,294 --> 00:42:59,794
for my previous performance.

773
00:43:02,763 --> 00:43:05,174
(Chaewon wants to perfect the performance more than anyone.)

774
00:43:09,104 --> 00:43:12,743
(Jiwon is slow at memorizing the choreography.)

775
00:43:18,183 --> 00:43:19,313
I'm sorry.

776
00:43:19,314 --> 00:43:20,682
- Oh, no. I couldn't do anything. - I think...

777
00:43:20,683 --> 00:43:22,354
our intro needs a lot of work.

778
00:43:29,924 --> 00:43:31,933
To be honest, I'm not confident.

779
00:43:32,834 --> 00:43:33,834
Why not?

780
00:43:33,835 --> 00:43:36,504
I'm really not confident. Earlier,

781
00:43:36,734 --> 00:43:39,274
I even thought about running away a few times.

782
00:43:39,703 --> 00:43:41,544
Seriously. This is...

783
00:43:42,444 --> 00:43:43,573
so tough on me.

784
00:43:45,243 --> 00:43:46,973
The seventh part. And...

785
00:43:49,144 --> 00:43:52,053
Just thinking about the time we had...

786
00:43:52,154 --> 00:43:56,253
Some of the girls didn't know the choreography.

787
00:43:56,254 --> 00:43:58,793
So time-wise, I didn't think...

788
00:43:58,794 --> 00:44:02,694
we had enough time to prepare for this performance.

789
00:44:04,424 --> 00:44:05,793
I still haven't memorized everything.

790
00:44:05,794 --> 00:44:07,363
- What do I do? - You can do it.

791
00:44:07,464 --> 00:44:08,763
Let's practice with me.

792
00:44:09,163 --> 00:44:10,163
This part...

793
00:44:10,164 --> 00:44:11,703
Has it been 20 minutes?

794
00:44:11,734 --> 00:44:13,604
- Should we start from the top? - Sure.

795
00:44:13,703 --> 00:44:15,544
- Can you count the beats? - Okay.

796
00:44:16,004 --> 00:44:18,242
One, two, three, four,

797
00:44:18,243 --> 00:44:20,612
five, six, seven, eight.

798
00:44:20,613 --> 00:44:21,743
One, two.

799
00:44:21,814 --> 00:44:23,683
- Your tempo was too fast. - What was it?

800
00:44:23,783 --> 00:44:26,213
- You missed this part. This one. - This one.

801
00:44:26,214 --> 00:44:27,984
- Then the tempo works out. - Okay. Sorry.

802
00:44:28,254 --> 00:44:30,983
Five, six...

803
00:44:30,984 --> 00:44:32,092
- That's right. - When I do this part,

804
00:44:32,093 --> 00:44:33,223
do I stretch out my palms?

805
00:44:33,453 --> 00:44:35,423
After this, you go like this.

806
00:44:35,424 --> 00:44:36,593
Can you show me one more time?

807
00:44:36,964 --> 00:44:39,432
- Like this. - One more time.

808
00:44:39,433 --> 00:44:41,802
Like this. Then you go like this.

809
00:44:41,803 --> 00:44:43,404
- One more time. I'm really sorry. - It's okay.

810
00:44:43,964 --> 00:44:45,403
(Yunha keeps dancing the same part for Jiwon.)

811
00:44:45,404 --> 00:44:46,532
- Okay. - Yes.

812
00:44:46,533 --> 00:44:47,604
- After this... - After this?

813
00:44:48,303 --> 00:44:52,044
(Pure Winners dance together as a group.)

814
00:44:55,044 --> 00:44:57,483
(When they are practicing the choreography as a team, )

815
00:44:57,484 --> 00:45:01,783
(why is Jiwon standing in the corner alone?)

816
00:45:06,754 --> 00:45:09,624
Practice with me. I need to go over the choreography too.

817
00:45:10,694 --> 00:45:13,133
I can't do it. I feel self-conscious in front of the cameras.

818
00:45:14,033 --> 00:45:16,033
- Why are you so clingy? - Come again?

819
00:45:17,803 --> 00:45:18,874
What time is it?

820
00:45:19,104 --> 00:45:21,544
I really want to go home. Seriously.

821
00:45:22,104 --> 00:45:25,173
"Why am I doing this?"

822
00:45:25,174 --> 00:45:27,413
I've been questioning myself that.

823
00:45:27,613 --> 00:45:29,813
This is really tough on me.

824
00:45:29,814 --> 00:45:32,182
But everyone is working hard. They don't even seem tired.

825
00:45:32,183 --> 00:45:34,383
So I'm doing my best while hiding the fact that I'm tired.

826
00:45:38,953 --> 00:45:43,093
(That night, Jiwon is spending time alone in the dorm.)

827
00:45:44,933 --> 00:45:47,564
(Glancing)

828
00:45:49,033 --> 00:45:51,674
(She keeps looking at the camera as she feels self-conscious.)

829
00:45:52,573 --> 00:45:54,573
(Not long after...)

830
00:46:03,613 --> 00:46:07,084
(Jiwon turns off the camera all of a sudden.)

831
00:46:07,984 --> 00:46:09,723
- Has anyone seen Jiwon? - Yes.

832
00:46:09,883 --> 00:46:11,754
Jiwon hasn't come yet.

833
00:46:13,624 --> 00:46:16,694
(Jiwon hasn't come to the practice room.)

834
00:46:18,663 --> 00:46:19,694
Sunwoo.

835
00:46:21,093 --> 00:46:22,133
Sunwoo.

836
00:46:26,834 --> 00:46:28,144
Jiwon...

837
00:46:29,404 --> 00:46:31,874
(The staff brings up Jiwon with the leader, Sunwoo.)

838
00:46:37,484 --> 00:46:39,353
Can everyone gather up?

839
00:46:39,354 --> 00:46:40,354
- Okay. - Okay.

840
00:46:40,613 --> 00:46:41,624
Well,

841
00:46:43,354 --> 00:46:46,354
- there's supposed to be nine of us. - Yes.

842
00:46:46,424 --> 00:46:50,694
But Jiwon doesn't feel good.

843
00:46:51,334 --> 00:46:55,202
So she can't join us today for this practice session.

844
00:46:55,203 --> 00:46:58,604
I thought I had to share this news with you.

845
00:46:58,874 --> 00:47:00,174
She can't come right now.

846
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:03,503
But we'll try to get her to come back.

847
00:47:03,504 --> 00:47:05,044
That's why she's resting now.

848
00:47:05,314 --> 00:47:08,313
- So please be understanding. - Okay.

849
00:47:08,314 --> 00:47:09,544
- Okay. - Okay.

850
00:47:09,913 --> 00:47:11,984
We'll be able to practice with us today, though. Right?

851
00:47:12,283 --> 00:47:14,183
I'm not sure about that.

852
00:47:14,553 --> 00:47:16,783
She shouldn't take this much time off.

853
00:47:17,124 --> 00:47:18,654
She already needs a lot of help.

854
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:20,793
If she takes this much time off...

855
00:47:20,794 --> 00:47:22,424
and we keep practicing as a group,

856
00:47:22,624 --> 00:47:24,363
it will be harder on her.

857
00:47:24,694 --> 00:47:27,263
I had no choice but to be more realistic.

858
00:47:27,964 --> 00:47:29,033
Then...

859
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:32,932
let's go over our movements. Think of it as reviewing our spots.

860
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:34,632
Let's take it from the top and finish it.

861
00:47:34,633 --> 00:47:36,004
- Sure. - Sounds good.

862
00:47:36,104 --> 00:47:37,104
I think...

863
00:47:37,105 --> 00:47:40,044
the left side is getting tighter compared to the right side.

864
00:47:40,113 --> 00:47:41,382
- Can you move to the side? - But...

865
00:47:41,383 --> 00:47:43,613
Jiwon is supposed to be here.

866
00:47:44,754 --> 00:47:46,314
- Move a bit more? Here? - Yes?

867
00:47:46,413 --> 00:47:48,283
- Up to this point? - Thank you.

868
00:47:48,683 --> 00:47:51,653
So this should be the formation. Let's check one more time.

869
00:47:51,654 --> 00:47:52,924
- Okay. - Okay.

870
00:47:58,064 --> 00:47:59,932
- Is this good? - We should stop here.

871
00:47:59,933 --> 00:48:01,933
- Jiwon. - Her spot should be in the front.

872
00:48:04,004 --> 00:48:05,433
Should I move forward a bit more?

873
00:48:06,073 --> 00:48:08,473
Don't I have to stand in between?

874
00:48:09,044 --> 00:48:10,303
I'm not sure.

875
00:48:12,774 --> 00:48:15,742
The other girls were getting exhausted too.

876
00:48:15,743 --> 00:48:19,654
I was concerned that Jiwon's absence might cause...

877
00:48:19,683 --> 00:48:23,923
the other girls to feel anxious or have doubts.

878
00:48:23,924 --> 00:48:25,794
I was concerned more than anything.

879
00:48:26,953 --> 00:48:28,924
Should the people on the sides spread out more?

880
00:48:28,964 --> 00:48:30,624
How should I put it? Well...

881
00:48:30,723 --> 00:48:31,763
The sides?

882
00:48:31,863 --> 00:48:32,992
I'm not sure.

883
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:34,263
(Will they be able to perform on stage?)

884
00:48:34,363 --> 00:48:37,604
(During dinner that day)

885
00:48:38,234 --> 00:48:39,473
Are you stressed?

886
00:48:39,973 --> 00:48:41,073
It's like...

887
00:48:44,544 --> 00:48:45,644
What's wrong?

888
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:48,913
Jiwon...

889
00:48:49,913 --> 00:48:51,214
Jiwon...

890
00:48:51,754 --> 00:48:54,853
is going through a hard time.

891
00:48:54,854 --> 00:48:59,953
So I'm feeling all sorts of mixed feelings.

892
00:49:00,593 --> 00:49:02,693
- I... - Soyul?

893
00:49:02,694 --> 00:49:03,763
Me?

894
00:49:04,564 --> 00:49:06,233
We can finalize the formations...

895
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:07,294
- once Jiwon comes back. - Yes.

896
00:49:07,334 --> 00:49:09,503
- And the angles too. - The angles.

897
00:49:09,504 --> 00:49:11,032
That might be why you're not visible on camera.

898
00:49:11,033 --> 00:49:12,033
(As time passes by, they get more anxious.)

899
00:49:12,904 --> 00:49:14,073
Sunwoo.

900
00:49:15,404 --> 00:49:20,673
How close do you think you guys are to finish preparing for the battle?

901
00:49:20,674 --> 00:49:23,544
We're working on it, but I'm not sure how close we are.

902
00:49:23,984 --> 00:49:27,314
We finished up to the first verse. The details and the formations...

903
00:49:27,354 --> 00:49:30,754
I did think that we were in trouble.

904
00:49:31,354 --> 00:49:33,093
I don't know when this distress will explode.

905
00:49:33,624 --> 00:49:35,624
I'm worried about that the most.

906
00:49:38,863 --> 00:49:40,833
- Can we take a five-minute break? - Sure.

907
00:49:40,834 --> 00:49:42,433
- Let's take a break. - My legs are killing me.

908
00:49:42,734 --> 00:49:44,103
(When the members are reaching the limit...)

909
00:49:44,104 --> 00:49:47,072
Just go over the details in your head.

910
00:49:47,073 --> 00:49:48,174
(When the members are reaching the limit...)

911
00:49:50,573 --> 00:49:52,072
- Jiwon is here. - Gosh, Jiwon.

912
00:49:52,073 --> 00:49:53,313
- Jiwon. - Jiwon.

913
00:49:53,314 --> 00:49:56,544
(Jiwon returns to the practice room.)

914
00:49:57,013 --> 00:49:59,552
Why do you look so exhausted?

915
00:49:59,553 --> 00:50:01,523
- Come here. - She looks so pale.

916
00:50:01,524 --> 00:50:03,484
- Come here. - Come here, Jiwon.

917
00:50:03,624 --> 00:50:05,894
- Our baby. - We missed you.

918
00:50:05,993 --> 00:50:07,523
Let's give her a hug.

919
00:50:07,524 --> 00:50:09,694
- Let's start with a hug. - Give her a hug.

920
00:50:09,993 --> 00:50:11,023
- You just got here. - Our baby.

921
00:50:11,024 --> 00:50:12,132
Why are you crying?

922
00:50:12,133 --> 00:50:13,293
- We missed you. - What?

923
00:50:13,294 --> 00:50:15,262
- We weren't worried, Jiwon. - Right.

924
00:50:15,263 --> 00:50:17,064
- Right. - Of course. We believed in you.

925
00:50:17,504 --> 00:50:19,572
- What's wrong? - You were doing a great job.

926
00:50:19,573 --> 00:50:21,273
- It's okay. - Right. Seriously.

927
00:50:21,274 --> 00:50:23,044
Right. This is just the beginning.

928
00:50:24,913 --> 00:50:26,743
We can do it.

929
00:50:32,513 --> 00:50:34,154
I used to do sports.

930
00:50:35,383 --> 00:50:38,353
(Jiwon was a rhythmic gymnast for 11 years.)

931
00:50:38,354 --> 00:50:39,654
- You got this! - You can do it!

932
00:50:39,894 --> 00:50:43,023
- You can do it! - You can do it!

933
00:50:43,024 --> 00:50:44,794
(She was alone most of the time as a gymnast.)

934
00:50:46,394 --> 00:50:47,932
Please stand in the center.

935
00:50:47,933 --> 00:50:49,362
(In-person Audition, May 21, 2023)

936
00:50:49,363 --> 00:50:52,203
Hi. I'm Jung Jiwon, 18 years old.

937
00:50:52,573 --> 00:50:55,003
As a former rhythmic gymnast, I'm very flexible...

938
00:50:55,004 --> 00:50:56,674
and have a pretty body line.

939
00:50:58,473 --> 00:51:01,814
(Jiwon has a new dream now.)

940
00:51:03,613 --> 00:51:07,713
Everyone is amazing while I'm falling behind.

941
00:51:07,714 --> 00:51:10,053
I feel helpless and feel the pressure.

942
00:51:11,124 --> 00:51:13,654
To be honest, I want...

943
00:51:15,064 --> 00:51:17,823
to stay here and keep trying.

944
00:51:18,223 --> 00:51:20,564
I want to show others my stage, and a good stage, at that.

945
00:51:21,163 --> 00:51:23,802
I want to become a person and a member...

946
00:51:23,803 --> 00:51:27,573
who keeps growing one step at a time.

947
00:51:28,843 --> 00:51:31,472
I lacked in skills, and yet didn't practice.

948
00:51:31,473 --> 00:51:33,274
I hated myself for being in bed.

949
00:51:33,774 --> 00:51:36,513
I just really wanted to go home. I'm sorry.

950
00:51:37,183 --> 00:51:38,754
I'll give it my all.

951
00:51:42,484 --> 00:51:46,493
Thank you for mustering up the courage to come back.

952
00:51:48,593 --> 00:51:49,663
Thank you.

953
00:51:50,624 --> 00:51:52,234
I'll do my best.

954
00:51:55,133 --> 00:51:56,303
Why are you crying?

955
00:51:59,834 --> 00:52:01,973
Stop crying, everyone.

956
00:52:02,743 --> 00:52:04,202
- Let's give it a shot. - Yes.

957
00:52:04,203 --> 00:52:05,214
I'm in.

958
00:52:06,073 --> 00:52:07,743
Shall we do a cheer together?

959
00:52:08,013 --> 00:52:09,283
Okay, let's do it.

960
00:52:10,144 --> 00:52:11,144
Everyone.

961
00:52:11,145 --> 00:52:12,984
We took this chance...

962
00:52:13,883 --> 00:52:15,654
and decided to brace ourselves,

963
00:52:15,953 --> 00:52:20,294
practice together with winning in mind,

964
00:52:20,394 --> 00:52:24,993
and put more effort into the preparation.

965
00:52:29,834 --> 00:52:30,904
I did it!

966
00:52:31,564 --> 00:52:33,104
- I did it! - Really?

967
00:52:33,303 --> 00:52:34,334
It's okay.

968
00:52:35,674 --> 00:52:36,674
(She got it wrong again.)

969
00:52:36,675 --> 00:52:38,774
It's okay.

970
00:52:38,843 --> 00:52:40,874
I couldn't tell that Jiwon was absent.

971
00:52:42,783 --> 00:52:43,883
What is it?

972
00:52:44,044 --> 00:52:45,612
She said she couldn't tell you were absent.

973
00:52:45,613 --> 00:52:46,613
- Yes. - Really?

974
00:52:46,614 --> 00:52:48,882
Yunha has a really nice voice.

975
00:52:48,883 --> 00:52:50,423
- Thank you. - So I think...

976
00:52:50,424 --> 00:52:52,194
- we can add more cute vibes. - Then...

977
00:52:54,794 --> 00:52:56,493
(The teammates help each others' shortcomings.)

978
00:52:57,564 --> 00:52:59,092
- Perfect. - That was perfect.

979
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:00,693
- How cute. - You were perfect.

980
00:53:00,694 --> 00:53:02,233
- I can't believe it. - Is this wrong?

981
00:53:02,234 --> 00:53:04,302
We are competitors,

982
00:53:04,303 --> 00:53:07,473
but we're currently teammates who have to prepare a stage together.

983
00:53:08,803 --> 00:53:12,714
Simply being able to do a stage together with the others...

984
00:53:13,113 --> 00:53:17,314
is a very valuable experience and a great memory.

985
00:53:17,783 --> 00:53:20,314
I'd like them to know that.

986
00:53:21,214 --> 00:53:22,322
- Okay. - Let's be happy.

987
00:53:22,323 --> 00:53:23,623
- I can see it. - Smile.

988
00:53:23,624 --> 00:53:24,654
- Okay. - Here we go.

989
00:53:24,924 --> 00:53:25,924
Pure Winners.

990
00:53:25,925 --> 00:53:27,394
- We can do it! - We can do it!

991
00:53:29,663 --> 00:53:30,663
We can do it.

992
00:53:30,924 --> 00:53:33,394
It's my first time watching someone else perform this song in person.

993
00:53:33,593 --> 00:53:34,633
- Really? - Yes.

994
00:53:34,993 --> 00:53:37,004
And with nine members, at that.

995
00:53:37,363 --> 00:53:38,404
Is that so?

996
00:53:38,973 --> 00:53:41,303
- They must be nervous. - They all look cute.

997
00:53:49,283 --> 00:53:50,343
We can do it.

998
00:53:50,783 --> 00:53:53,314
I want us to perform an incredible "Into the New World..."

999
00:53:53,913 --> 00:53:56,322
that will shock everyone to the point...

1000
00:53:56,323 --> 00:53:58,894
their jaws drop when they watch it.

1001
00:54:02,694 --> 00:54:06,593
("Into the New World" by Girls' Generation)

1002
00:55:36,754 --> 00:55:38,754
- Isn't it your part, Hyoyeon? - Yes.

1003
00:55:43,024 --> 00:55:44,593
- Swirl it! - Swirl!

1004
00:56:37,383 --> 00:56:38,383
That was good.

1005
00:56:44,223 --> 00:56:46,953
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1006
00:56:47,854 --> 00:56:48,863
They were amazing.

1007
00:56:49,223 --> 00:56:50,263
Thank you.

1008
00:56:52,794 --> 00:56:54,163
You must've practiced as a group...

1009
00:56:54,863 --> 00:56:56,163
quite a few times.

1010
00:56:56,234 --> 00:56:57,262
- The group... - Yes.

1011
00:56:57,263 --> 00:56:59,904
The group was in sync much better than I thought.

1012
00:57:00,073 --> 00:57:03,044
This choreography requires you to stretch your arms and legs out,

1013
00:57:03,274 --> 00:57:05,374
which means you need a solid foundation...

1014
00:57:06,274 --> 00:57:08,174
to dance it out.

1015
00:57:08,513 --> 00:57:10,743
So if you're not in sync even just by a bit,

1016
00:57:11,113 --> 00:57:13,113
you stand out if you get the move wrong.

1017
00:57:13,214 --> 00:57:15,383
But you were much better in sync than I expected.

1018
00:57:15,984 --> 00:57:17,553
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1019
00:57:18,084 --> 00:57:20,193
If I have to describe "Into the New World..."

1020
00:57:20,194 --> 00:57:22,322
in one word, it's energy.

1021
00:57:22,323 --> 00:57:24,523
I could really feel that energy...

1022
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:26,194
- from Gyoryeon the most. - Yes?

1023
00:57:26,694 --> 00:57:29,104
You understood the choreography really well...

1024
00:57:29,303 --> 00:57:32,073
and showed that energy the most.

1025
00:57:32,133 --> 00:57:33,473
Thank you.

1026
00:57:36,404 --> 00:57:40,544
And Jiwon, you did rhythmic gymnastics back then.

1027
00:57:40,944 --> 00:57:43,182
I was very impressed by it.

1028
00:57:43,183 --> 00:57:44,313
So I thought this song...

1029
00:57:44,314 --> 00:57:47,653
would suit you perfectly...

1030
00:57:47,654 --> 00:57:49,024
and had high expectations.

1031
00:57:49,124 --> 00:57:51,282
But it felt like you lacked confidence,

1032
00:57:51,283 --> 00:57:53,493
maybe because you might not have practiced...

1033
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:56,564
as much as the other members. It was a bummer.

1034
00:57:57,093 --> 00:57:58,093
That's all.

1035
00:57:59,533 --> 00:58:00,794
Sunwoo.

1036
00:58:01,564 --> 00:58:02,763
- Yes? - Firstly,

1037
00:58:03,533 --> 00:58:05,033
even if you fail the first ad-lib,

1038
00:58:05,163 --> 00:58:08,033
I hope you don't give up on the next one.

1039
00:58:19,584 --> 00:58:22,183
When you made that mistake midway,

1040
00:58:22,683 --> 00:58:25,493
I could tell you were anxious.

1041
00:58:26,053 --> 00:58:28,794
I must scold you for this. It's not right.

1042
00:58:29,223 --> 00:58:30,464
Let's say you make a mistake.

1043
00:58:30,663 --> 00:58:33,592
If you're before your fans, your fans will think it's cute.

1044
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:34,734
And that's understandable.

1045
00:58:34,964 --> 00:58:37,734
But before the general public, it's a big no.

1046
00:58:42,004 --> 00:58:44,174
Well, that's it.

1047
00:58:47,644 --> 00:58:51,382
Winners. Please leave the stage and stand by.

1048
00:58:51,383 --> 00:58:52,782
- Okay. Thank you. - Thank you.

1049
00:58:52,783 --> 00:58:54,053
Great job.

1050
00:58:57,654 --> 00:58:59,493
- All right. - Guys, don't get hurt.

1051
00:58:59,754 --> 00:59:01,153
- Let's do this. - Be happy and enjoy it.

1052
00:59:01,154 --> 00:59:02,794
- Trust in how much we practiced. - Let's enjoy it.

1053
00:59:08,564 --> 00:59:11,203
(3 days before the Revenge Battle)

1054
00:59:13,973 --> 00:59:16,973
(Only silence lingers in the Challengers Team.)

1055
00:59:17,973 --> 00:59:19,243
I'm getting nervous.

1056
00:59:19,314 --> 00:59:20,444
What now?

1057
00:59:21,374 --> 00:59:23,483
(Another silence)

1058
00:59:23,484 --> 00:59:26,783
I think everyone has their own anxieties.

1059
00:59:27,953 --> 00:59:31,223
Not being able to contribute to my team...

1060
00:59:31,524 --> 00:59:33,854
worried me.

1061
00:59:34,453 --> 00:59:36,263
I felt much smaller.

1062
00:59:36,394 --> 00:59:37,964
I had zero confidence.

1063
00:59:41,763 --> 00:59:43,662
(In the last 1-on-1 Battle, )

1064
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:46,334
(Jang Minju was crushed.)

1065
00:59:47,533 --> 00:59:52,044
What bummed me out was the fact that my nervousness and mistakes...

1066
00:59:52,314 --> 00:59:53,343
ruined...

1067
00:59:54,113 --> 00:59:57,783
the stage I had prepared for a month.

1068
00:59:59,714 --> 01:00:02,984
Hi. I'm Jang Minju, 23 years old, born in 2001.

1069
01:00:03,154 --> 01:00:05,953
Please look forward to my last attempt at becoming an idol.

1070
01:00:07,194 --> 01:00:09,124
Are you currently an idol?

1071
01:00:09,924 --> 01:00:12,633
I was a member of the girl group MAJORS...

1072
01:00:12,794 --> 01:00:15,294
until I signed the dismissal contract last month.

1073
01:00:15,834 --> 01:00:17,063
That's why...

1074
01:00:17,064 --> 01:00:18,163
- this is your last attempt. - Yes.

1075
01:00:21,473 --> 01:00:24,973
(Girl group MAJOR's A-ki)

1076
01:00:25,144 --> 01:00:26,144
(After dropping out, Jang Minju)

1077
01:00:26,145 --> 01:00:27,673
How does your daily schedule go?

1078
01:00:27,674 --> 01:00:31,513
Before I applied for this audition show,

1079
01:00:31,584 --> 01:00:33,182
I worked part-time at an academy.

1080
01:00:33,183 --> 01:00:37,383
I worked part-time for a long time at a lamb skewer restaurant.

1081
01:00:37,524 --> 01:00:39,153
In the evening, I worked part-time.

1082
01:00:39,154 --> 01:00:43,663
During the day, I studied writing music and lyrics.

1083
01:00:44,394 --> 01:00:47,563
(She plucked up her courage and applied to Universe Ticket.)

1084
01:00:47,564 --> 01:00:49,703
How do you want to be remembered?

1085
01:00:50,464 --> 01:00:52,702
Someone who doesn't give up.

1086
01:00:52,703 --> 01:00:54,504
(Someone who doesn't give up)

1087
01:00:54,874 --> 01:00:59,314
I'm making an effort since I don't want to have regrets.

1088
01:00:59,613 --> 01:01:00,613
(2nd Kwon Chaewon, 42nd Jeon Jieun)

1089
01:01:01,644 --> 01:01:04,314
(They came together for the same dream.)

1090
01:01:05,854 --> 01:01:08,883
(But Challengers faced devastation.)

1091
01:01:09,283 --> 01:01:11,423
"I need to work harder."

1092
01:01:11,424 --> 01:01:12,794
I had that thought.

1093
01:01:17,763 --> 01:01:20,334
We can do it. Let's do well.

1094
01:01:20,464 --> 01:01:22,702
We only have three days.

1095
01:01:22,703 --> 01:01:23,734
Seriously.

1096
01:01:23,803 --> 01:01:26,604
We don't have much time. We have two days and a half.

1097
01:01:26,803 --> 01:01:28,404
Shall we practice the dance?

1098
01:01:29,504 --> 01:01:31,472
- As we sing, "Ah-choo," - Ah-choo

1099
01:01:31,473 --> 01:01:33,242
- the right foot will go forward. - Okay.

1100
01:01:33,243 --> 01:01:34,912
To the left. "Ah."

1101
01:01:34,913 --> 01:01:37,843
- "Ah." - "Ah-choo." Then grab the nose.

1102
01:01:38,013 --> 01:01:39,953
- "Choo." - "Choo." Boom.

1103
01:01:40,314 --> 01:01:42,113
- Do we show the palm? - Yes.

1104
01:01:42,484 --> 01:01:44,853
As we do this, let's have the fingers together.

1105
01:01:44,854 --> 01:01:45,953
- Okay. - Okay.

1106
01:01:46,894 --> 01:01:48,793
(Most of the members don't know the dance.)

1107
01:01:48,794 --> 01:01:50,063
Two, three.

1108
01:01:50,064 --> 01:01:53,532
- I feel like I am going - I feel like I am going

1109
01:01:53,533 --> 01:01:54,693
Is it one step...

1110
01:01:54,694 --> 01:01:56,163
- at "I am going?" - Do we kick?

1111
01:01:56,533 --> 01:01:57,702
- It isn't a kick. - Lift it up.

1112
01:01:57,703 --> 01:02:00,633
You need to do this to make the move look neater.

1113
01:02:00,734 --> 01:02:03,644
I feel like I am going Then you go, "Ah."

1114
01:02:03,843 --> 01:02:05,643
- I have a question. - Okay.

1115
01:02:05,644 --> 01:02:08,012
Do you stretch out your arms like this? Is it diagonal?

1116
01:02:08,013 --> 01:02:10,013
- It's straight. - It's straight.

1117
01:02:10,814 --> 01:02:12,182
As for the right foot,

1118
01:02:12,183 --> 01:02:14,782
do you lift it up like this? Does it touch the other leg?

1119
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:17,623
It needs to touch the leg like this.

1120
01:02:17,624 --> 01:02:19,322
- The right foot. - Yes.

1121
01:02:19,323 --> 01:02:20,924
The supporting leg.

1122
01:02:21,124 --> 01:02:22,492
- The front foot... - Lift the back foot.

1123
01:02:22,493 --> 01:02:24,222
It's better to lift the back foot.

1124
01:02:24,223 --> 01:02:25,633
Okay.

1125
01:02:27,633 --> 01:02:28,963
- Are you okay? - Yes.

1126
01:02:28,964 --> 01:02:30,803
We will do this at "Ah."

1127
01:02:31,133 --> 01:02:35,234
Since none of the members know...

1128
01:02:35,334 --> 01:02:38,473
the song and the dance exactly,

1129
01:02:38,904 --> 01:02:42,243
we are full of worries.

1130
01:02:42,413 --> 01:02:45,044
We aren't even done with the first verse yet.

1131
01:02:45,683 --> 01:02:46,882
I thought,

1132
01:02:46,883 --> 01:02:50,453
"I need to finish the dance by tonight."

1133
01:02:53,654 --> 01:02:55,523
I heard about Winners.

1134
01:02:55,524 --> 01:02:58,493
They finished the dance without going over the details.

1135
01:02:58,894 --> 01:02:59,894
Seriously.

1136
01:03:00,593 --> 01:03:01,862
That's how it's supposed to be.

1137
01:03:01,863 --> 01:03:03,032
You work on the details later.

1138
01:03:03,033 --> 01:03:05,903
You memorize the dance before working on the formation.

1139
01:03:05,904 --> 01:03:08,473
Then you work on the formation and fix the details.

1140
01:03:09,544 --> 01:03:13,443
At "My lips," you will take a step.

1141
01:03:13,444 --> 01:03:15,314
(Challengers still didn't memorize the dance moves individually.)

1142
01:03:15,374 --> 01:03:16,782
- Drag it. - Like this.

1143
01:03:16,783 --> 01:03:17,882
- Yes. - Thank you.

1144
01:03:17,883 --> 01:03:19,753
Do you turn right away?

1145
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:21,483
(They went over the details for every move.)

1146
01:03:21,484 --> 01:03:23,823
- Yes, you turn right away. - Okay.

1147
01:03:24,323 --> 01:03:27,393
After you do this, does the right foot go forward?

1148
01:03:27,394 --> 01:03:28,694
- Yes. - That's right.

1149
01:03:29,163 --> 01:03:30,894
Even if we work on the details now,

1150
01:03:31,964 --> 01:03:35,163
the girls will get a mental breakdown if the dance moves along too slowly.

1151
01:03:36,404 --> 01:03:38,064
We need to go over the entire song tomorrow.

1152
01:03:38,663 --> 01:03:41,572
(2 days before the Revenge Battle)

1153
01:03:41,573 --> 01:03:44,802
- Can I ask you a question? - Okay.

1154
01:03:44,803 --> 01:03:47,242
We have an hour and 15 minutes before dinner.

1155
01:03:47,243 --> 01:03:49,782
Shall we work hard...

1156
01:03:49,783 --> 01:03:52,182
and go over the entire dance...

1157
01:03:52,183 --> 01:03:54,182
- before dinner? - Shall we skip the details?

1158
01:03:54,183 --> 01:03:55,822
- Are you okay with that? - I love it.

1159
01:03:55,823 --> 01:03:57,583
- I think it will be better. - Let's learn the entire dance.

1160
01:03:57,584 --> 01:03:58,654
Seven, eight.

1161
01:03:59,053 --> 01:04:03,763
(They change their plans and go over the entire dance.)

1162
01:04:11,964 --> 01:04:17,143
(Challengers speed up in learning the dance.)

1163
01:04:17,144 --> 01:04:19,473
- You line up like this. - That's right.

1164
01:04:22,144 --> 01:04:23,182
Like this.

1165
01:04:23,183 --> 01:04:26,013
- We are nearly done. - We are nearly done.

1166
01:04:27,013 --> 01:04:30,052
You aren't used to the moves yet,

1167
01:04:30,053 --> 01:04:31,923
but that's how the dance goes.

1168
01:04:31,924 --> 01:04:34,024
We succeeded in going over the entire thing before dinner.

1169
01:04:34,124 --> 01:04:35,992
Shall we go and eat dinner?

1170
01:04:35,993 --> 01:04:37,593
- Let's go. - Go.

1171
01:04:38,064 --> 01:04:39,734
- Where shall we sit? - Here.

1172
01:04:40,093 --> 01:04:41,564
Let's sit together.

1173
01:04:44,504 --> 01:04:46,532
- Look. - Look behind you.

1174
01:04:46,533 --> 01:04:47,932
The sky is opening up.

1175
01:04:47,933 --> 01:04:49,873
- No way. - Oh, my goodness.

1176
01:04:49,874 --> 01:04:50,972
(A surprise event for the girls who are tired from the competition)

1177
01:04:50,973 --> 01:04:53,012
- It's so nice. - Oh, my goodness.

1178
01:04:53,013 --> 01:04:55,174
The weather is so nice.

1179
01:04:55,674 --> 01:04:57,544
The sky is so pretty.

1180
01:04:58,343 --> 01:05:00,984
- Shall we eat? - Thank you for the food.

1181
01:05:01,084 --> 01:05:03,052
- Enjoy the food. - Enjoy the food.

1182
01:05:03,053 --> 01:05:04,354
It's tasty.

1183
01:05:05,183 --> 01:05:06,523
It's so tasty.

1184
01:05:06,524 --> 01:05:08,822
- I can't believe it. - It has been grilled so well.

1185
01:05:08,823 --> 01:05:10,493
It's so tasty.

1186
01:05:13,464 --> 01:05:17,763
(They continue practicing even during dinner.)

1187
01:05:18,604 --> 01:05:20,303
You need to memorize everything. Make sure you do it.

1188
01:05:20,703 --> 01:05:21,734
You can do it, right?

1189
01:05:22,104 --> 01:05:23,104
Shall we go?

1190
01:05:23,105 --> 01:05:24,742
(Let's go and practice!)

1191
01:05:24,743 --> 01:05:27,243
Let's memorize the dance.

1192
01:05:28,714 --> 01:05:31,814
Practice is the way to survive.

1193
01:05:32,044 --> 01:05:35,253
I can really feel that everyone wants...

1194
01:05:35,254 --> 01:05:37,254
to work hard.

1195
01:05:38,584 --> 01:05:39,923
Shall we do a cheer?

1196
01:05:39,924 --> 01:05:42,194
(1 day before the Revenge Battle)

1197
01:05:42,294 --> 01:05:44,492
- Good luck. - Thank you.

1198
01:05:44,493 --> 01:05:46,993
- Good luck. - Okay.

1199
01:06:07,683 --> 01:06:08,953
How cute.

1200
01:06:09,383 --> 01:06:11,452
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1201
01:06:11,453 --> 01:06:15,222
I personally think the chorus is the most important part.

1202
01:06:15,223 --> 01:06:18,993
Perhaps it was because you couldn't hear the song,

1203
01:06:19,093 --> 01:06:21,293
- but you sped up a lot. - Okay.

1204
01:06:21,294 --> 01:06:23,432
You sped up together.

1205
01:06:23,433 --> 01:06:26,132
It will be nice if you can relax...

1206
01:06:26,133 --> 01:06:27,903
- and slow down during that part. - Okay.

1207
01:06:27,904 --> 01:06:29,274
- Okay. - Thank you.

1208
01:06:29,444 --> 01:06:32,473
The two of you need to practice more.

1209
01:06:32,573 --> 01:06:36,283
I can tell that you aren't done with the dance.

1210
01:06:36,444 --> 01:06:38,782
Except for that,

1211
01:06:38,783 --> 01:06:41,552
the performance was pretty okay.

1212
01:06:41,553 --> 01:06:42,584
Okay.

1213
01:06:42,723 --> 01:06:44,484
You need to practice more.

1214
01:06:45,424 --> 01:06:47,323
I was so anxious.

1215
01:06:47,694 --> 01:06:49,964
My thoughts became scrambled the more I thought.

1216
01:06:55,433 --> 01:06:57,662
(Jang Minju continues to make a mistake.)

1217
01:06:57,663 --> 01:06:59,874
- I am sorry. - It's okay.

1218
01:07:00,674 --> 01:07:02,202
What was the next move?

1219
01:07:02,203 --> 01:07:06,044
(She becomes shaken up after the interim check.)

1220
01:07:06,473 --> 01:07:08,912
I don't have enough time to practice,

1221
01:07:08,913 --> 01:07:10,113
so I am anxious.

1222
01:07:12,383 --> 01:07:14,984
I need to have confidence,

1223
01:07:15,214 --> 01:07:17,923
but so many aspects that make me lose confidence...

1224
01:07:17,924 --> 01:07:21,154
- are starting to come to me. - A bit more.

1225
01:07:21,394 --> 01:07:23,694
I might end up going home.

1226
01:07:23,964 --> 01:07:28,993
(Anxiety spread in everyone's heart.)

1227
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:31,262
- Are you exhausted? - Oh, no.

1228
01:07:31,263 --> 01:07:32,903
You are exhausted.

1229
01:07:32,904 --> 01:07:34,404
Because I can't do well...

1230
01:07:36,303 --> 01:07:38,243
Why do you think that?

1231
01:07:39,513 --> 01:07:41,012
- Thank you. - Memories...

1232
01:07:41,013 --> 01:07:44,343
of making a mistake during the 1-on-1 Battle came back.

1233
01:07:44,584 --> 01:07:47,083
I made a mistake, messed up the performance,

1234
01:07:47,084 --> 01:07:48,613
and lost with a score of 5 to 0.

1235
01:07:49,053 --> 01:07:50,854
I felt so pressured.

1236
01:07:51,183 --> 01:07:52,323
I...

1237
01:07:52,723 --> 01:07:55,394
might do the same thing again.

1238
01:07:56,024 --> 01:07:58,624
I might make a mistake and feel bad for the members.

1239
01:07:59,263 --> 01:08:03,603
When we take the stage, we only get one mistake.

1240
01:08:03,604 --> 01:08:05,662
Usually, I mess up once every ten times.

1241
01:08:05,663 --> 01:08:07,632
If I mess up on the stage,

1242
01:08:07,633 --> 01:08:10,903
everyone will think I am just like that.

1243
01:08:10,904 --> 01:08:13,042
That experience will...

1244
01:08:13,043 --> 01:08:15,472
- You are scared. - So I am scared.

1245
01:08:15,473 --> 01:08:17,914
I am scared that I might make a mistake.

1246
01:08:18,484 --> 01:08:20,453
You are crying since you worked hard.

1247
01:08:20,454 --> 01:08:22,484
- That's right. - I know that it's upsetting.

1248
01:08:28,723 --> 01:08:35,333
(Their anxiety begins to grow. Will they be able to perform well?)

1249
01:08:40,633 --> 01:08:44,973
("Ah-Choo" by Lovelyz)

1250
01:08:47,144 --> 01:08:48,314
How pretty.

1251
01:08:52,814 --> 01:08:54,013
My goodness.

1252
01:08:55,814 --> 01:08:57,024
They look so pretty.

1253
01:09:20,574 --> 01:09:22,244
How cute.

1254
01:10:28,513 --> 01:10:30,244
My goodness.

1255
01:10:50,404 --> 01:10:51,664
I think she forgot the lyrics.

1256
01:10:59,774 --> 01:11:01,513
Hyemi is really good.

1257
01:11:46,494 --> 01:11:48,154
I don't know what to tell them.

1258
01:11:49,564 --> 01:11:50,722
I don't have anything.

1259
01:11:50,723 --> 01:11:51,824
Me neither.

1260
01:11:58,404 --> 01:11:59,904
Minju,

1261
01:12:01,003 --> 01:12:04,074
were you very nervous today?

1262
01:12:07,074 --> 01:12:08,443
I am sorry.

1263
01:12:08,444 --> 01:12:11,814
I lost my focus for a moment.

1264
01:12:12,414 --> 01:12:16,324
Your performance worried me.

1265
01:12:19,083 --> 01:12:20,123
It's okay.

1266
01:12:27,494 --> 01:12:28,593
I just...

1267
01:12:29,463 --> 01:12:31,703
I am sorry. My head went blank.

1268
01:12:31,704 --> 01:12:33,172
Teammates, I am so sorry.

1269
01:12:33,173 --> 01:12:34,503
It's okay.

1270
01:12:42,173 --> 01:12:43,182
Thank you for your hard work.

1271
01:12:43,183 --> 01:12:44,944
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1272
01:12:47,354 --> 01:12:49,922
She had a mental breakdown when she got the lyrics wrong.

1273
01:12:49,923 --> 01:12:52,323
- Yes. After messing up the lyrics, - She had a mental breakdown.

1274
01:12:52,324 --> 01:12:53,654
She made a mistake with the formation too.

1275
01:12:54,194 --> 01:12:57,593
We didn't have much time to prepare for the performance,

1276
01:12:59,123 --> 01:13:03,904
so the weight on my heart was heavier than the last time.

1277
01:13:07,173 --> 01:13:09,603
When I made a mistake,

1278
01:13:09,604 --> 01:13:14,543
all other members had a mental breakdown...

1279
01:13:15,274 --> 01:13:17,183
and messed up the performance.

1280
01:13:20,654 --> 01:13:21,883
It's too bad.

1281
01:13:26,723 --> 01:13:28,222
(Announcing the result for the pure concept)

1282
01:13:28,223 --> 01:13:31,024
We will announce the result of the battle.

1283
01:13:31,664 --> 01:13:34,433
The winner of the pure concept is..

1284
01:13:37,303 --> 01:13:40,534
(To be continued)

1285
01:13:41,311 --> 01:13:44,039
The winner of the pure concept is..

1286
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:45,141
(Which team won the pure concept?)

1287
01:13:51,050 --> 01:13:52,920
Pure Winners.

1288
01:13:53,420 --> 01:13:54,620
Congratulations.

1289
01:13:55,290 --> 01:13:56,459
Did we win?

1290
01:13:56,460 --> 01:13:57,590
(Pure Winners won.)

1291
01:13:57,991 --> 01:14:00,090
Why are you crying? Don't cry.

1292
01:14:00,491 --> 01:14:04,499
With a score of 4 to 1, Pure Winners won.

1293
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:07,731
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1294
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:12,440
- Don't cry. - Come here.

1295
01:14:12,441 --> 01:14:14,141
- Good job. - Come here.

1296
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:15,570
My goodness.

1297
01:14:15,571 --> 01:14:16,980
- Thank you. - Well done.

1298
01:14:16,981 --> 01:14:18,240
Thank you.

1299
01:14:18,241 --> 01:14:19,610
We won thanks to you.

1300
01:14:19,611 --> 01:14:21,280
Thank you so much.

1301
01:14:21,281 --> 01:14:22,981
- Seriously. - Come together.

1302
01:14:23,580 --> 01:14:24,851
Hurry up and come together.

1303
01:14:25,481 --> 01:14:27,150
- Come on. - Everyone worked hard.

1304
01:14:27,151 --> 01:14:28,289
That's right.

1305
01:14:28,290 --> 01:14:30,260
We know that you wanted to do well more than anyone here.

1306
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:33,089
- I am sorry. - Don't be sorry.

1307
01:14:33,090 --> 01:14:34,629
- I won't say sorry. - Seriously.

1308
01:14:34,630 --> 01:14:35,789
- Thank you. Seriously. - Thank you.

1309
01:14:35,790 --> 01:14:37,329
I am seriously grateful.

1310
01:14:37,330 --> 01:14:39,031
I don't have any regrets about myself,

1311
01:14:40,130 --> 01:14:42,100
but I feel so bad for the girls.

1312
01:14:42,101 --> 01:14:43,901
(I feel so bad for the girls.)

1313
01:14:49,010 --> 01:14:50,180
You know,

1314
01:14:50,181 --> 01:14:51,910
Minju will remember that...

1315
01:14:51,941 --> 01:14:54,549
- for her entire lifetime. - Losing?

1316
01:14:54,550 --> 01:14:56,080
"My team lost because of me."

1317
01:14:56,151 --> 01:14:58,080
"I made a mistake. What should I do?"

1318
01:14:58,321 --> 01:15:00,691
- No, she needs to overcome it. - Yes.

1319
01:15:00,750 --> 01:15:01,949
She needs to overcome it.

1320
01:15:01,950 --> 01:15:04,061
(It's the growing pain she must overcome for her dream.)

1321
01:15:04,660 --> 01:15:06,861
Sparkling Winners and Challengers,

1322
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:08,660
please come up to the stage.

1323
01:15:09,660 --> 01:15:12,700
(Sparkling Winners)

1324
01:15:12,901 --> 01:15:14,699
(Sparkling Challengers)

1325
01:15:14,700 --> 01:15:16,601
- Hello. - Hello.

1326
01:15:16,641 --> 01:15:19,840
- How cute. - They are so sparkly.

1327
01:15:21,811 --> 01:15:23,010
It's red and blue.

1328
01:15:23,141 --> 01:15:25,980
They look refreshing in those outfits.

1329
01:15:25,981 --> 01:15:27,351
So sparkling.

1330
01:15:28,151 --> 01:15:29,650
One, two, three.

1331
01:15:29,651 --> 01:15:31,950
We will color the stage red.

1332
01:15:32,181 --> 01:15:35,120
- We are Sparkling Winners. - We are Sparkling Winners.

1333
01:15:36,861 --> 01:15:37,960
So sparkling.

1334
01:15:39,491 --> 01:15:40,590
Two, three.

1335
01:15:41,630 --> 01:15:42,990
- Hello. - Hello.

1336
01:15:42,991 --> 01:15:46,570
We will create waves in your heart. We are...

1337
01:15:46,571 --> 01:15:49,169
- Team Sparkling Dolphin. - Team Sparkling Dolphin.

1338
01:15:49,170 --> 01:15:50,300
(We are Team Sparkling Dolphin!)

1339
01:15:51,340 --> 01:15:53,141
- How nice. - They are sparkling.

1340
01:15:55,241 --> 01:15:57,410
- They look like a new group. - Yes.

1341
01:15:58,210 --> 01:16:01,510
Now, Winners need to defend,

1342
01:16:01,811 --> 01:16:05,481
and Challengers need to attack in this battle.

1343
01:16:05,580 --> 01:16:10,690
While Winners work hard and do well,

1344
01:16:10,691 --> 01:16:12,360
we are better.

1345
01:16:12,361 --> 01:16:14,330
So we think we will win.

1346
01:16:18,361 --> 01:16:19,499
- "Dolphin." - "Dolphin."

1347
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:21,200
(The day the sparkling songs got revealed)

1348
01:16:21,330 --> 01:16:22,470
- "Dolphin." - "Dolphin."

1349
01:16:22,471 --> 01:16:24,169
(Challengers chose "Dolphin" by OH MY GIRL.)

1350
01:16:24,170 --> 01:16:25,741
That's incredible.

1351
01:16:27,941 --> 01:16:29,571
What's your song?

1352
01:16:30,010 --> 01:16:31,080
What's your guess?

1353
01:16:31,241 --> 01:16:32,579
We don't know.

1354
01:16:32,580 --> 01:16:33,749
- Guess. - Guess.

1355
01:16:33,750 --> 01:16:34,810
Are you very curious?

1356
01:16:34,811 --> 01:16:35,850
- We are very curious. - Yes.

1357
01:16:35,851 --> 01:16:37,020
Check it out on the stage.

1358
01:16:37,021 --> 01:16:39,280
(Unbelievable)

1359
01:16:39,281 --> 01:16:40,991
My goodness.

1360
01:16:41,590 --> 01:16:43,221
It hurt my pride.

1361
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:46,659
It made me boil up.

1362
01:16:46,660 --> 01:16:50,299
They must have chosen the style they are good at,

1363
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:51,960
so they have an advantage.

1364
01:16:52,830 --> 01:16:55,130
There were "Dolphin" and "Red Flavor."

1365
01:16:55,431 --> 01:16:59,571
Of course, I chose "Red Flavor."

1366
01:16:59,741 --> 01:17:01,709
"Red Flavor" is a song...

1367
01:17:01,710 --> 01:17:04,181
that has a kick toward the end.

1368
01:17:06,781 --> 01:17:11,049
I thought "Red Flavor" has more impact.

1369
01:17:11,050 --> 01:17:13,390
A performance of "Red Flavor."

1370
01:17:13,391 --> 01:17:16,419
I think I can pull it off really well...

1371
01:17:16,420 --> 01:17:18,891
because it's a very refreshing song.

1372
01:17:19,391 --> 01:17:20,690
What should we do?

1373
01:17:20,691 --> 01:17:23,401
(Silence falls among Sparkling Challengers)

1374
01:17:23,460 --> 01:17:25,499
"Dolphin" is a calm song...

1375
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:27,629
that doesn't have many ups and downs.

1376
01:17:27,630 --> 01:17:31,240
Winners' song must be full of energy.

1377
01:17:31,241 --> 01:17:33,710
I was worried about bringing out that energy.

1378
01:17:34,641 --> 01:17:39,181
During the 1-on-1 Battle, I made an unexpected mistake.

1379
01:17:39,781 --> 01:17:41,879
(During the 1-on-1 Battle)

1380
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:43,281
Eunchae, it has been a while.

1381
01:17:43,380 --> 01:17:44,949
Hello.

1382
01:17:44,950 --> 01:17:47,150
She starred in my music video...

1383
01:17:47,151 --> 01:17:48,550
of "Stardust."

1384
01:17:50,460 --> 01:17:55,861
(Eunchae starred in Younha's music video 2 years ago)

1385
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:01,931
(She sang "Comet" by Younha.)

1386
01:18:02,670 --> 01:18:06,369
(But she missed the beat due to nervousness.)

1387
01:18:06,370 --> 01:18:09,410
(She lost with a score of 4 to 1.)

1388
01:18:09,471 --> 01:18:11,311
Thank you.

1389
01:18:13,811 --> 01:18:15,079
Eunchae,

1390
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:17,221
I think I pulled you down.

1391
01:18:18,380 --> 01:18:21,191
Had you picked another song, you would have done much better.

1392
01:18:21,420 --> 01:18:25,620
I couldn't even show half of what I prepared.

1393
01:18:25,691 --> 01:18:27,160
I was very sad.

1394
01:18:27,731 --> 01:18:30,401
Younha said,

1395
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:32,860
"You..."

1396
01:18:32,861 --> 01:18:34,971
(You can't be a singer.)

1397
01:18:44,410 --> 01:18:45,811
It seems like...

1398
01:18:46,811 --> 01:18:48,950
you will need to steel your heart.

1399
01:18:49,151 --> 01:18:53,050
You will need to practice singing a lot.

1400
01:18:53,181 --> 01:18:55,721
It's not about the basic skills.

1401
01:18:56,651 --> 01:18:59,590
You made me wonder, "Will this be possible?"

1402
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:08,031
I think you should think about...

1403
01:19:08,130 --> 01:19:10,641
if you must become a singer.

1404
01:19:12,101 --> 01:19:15,610
I lacked the skills and didn't practice hard enough.

1405
01:19:15,611 --> 01:19:18,010
I am worried about doing well in the future.

1406
01:19:18,941 --> 01:19:21,110
I was worried...

1407
01:19:21,111 --> 01:19:22,850
if I could raise the energy levels.

1408
01:19:22,851 --> 01:19:24,351
That was my concern.

1409
01:19:28,691 --> 01:19:30,021
Let's give this a try.

1410
01:19:32,991 --> 01:19:38,699
My dancing and singing is a bit lacking,

1411
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:43,670
but I still thought about what I could do for the team.

1412
01:19:44,870 --> 01:19:46,440
(Winking)

1413
01:19:46,441 --> 01:19:47,441
That was cute.

1414
01:19:51,681 --> 01:19:52,681
Look at her.

1415
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:54,080
Let's go!

1416
01:19:54,450 --> 01:19:56,510
That's so cute.

1417
01:19:57,580 --> 01:20:00,420
(With high energy levels, their practice goes smoothly.)

1418
01:20:02,151 --> 01:20:04,620
I was worried at first.

1419
01:20:04,790 --> 01:20:06,691
We all want to...

1420
01:20:06,861 --> 01:20:08,960
win through this Revenge Battle.

1421
01:20:09,290 --> 01:20:11,659
That's why we're all practicing with a great passion.

1422
01:20:11,660 --> 01:20:12,700
That's it!

1423
01:20:13,361 --> 01:20:14,531
Okay.

1424
01:20:16,431 --> 01:20:18,800
- Good work. - Good work.

1425
01:20:18,941 --> 01:20:20,710
- Bye. - Bye.

1426
01:20:23,540 --> 01:20:25,579
During the live performance, you have to dance even harder.

1427
01:20:25,580 --> 01:20:26,580
- Okay. - Okay.

1428
01:20:30,721 --> 01:20:35,990
During the 1-on-1 Battle, I was criticized greatly.

1429
01:20:35,991 --> 01:20:39,560
I thought I needed to work much harder than everyone else.

1430
01:20:39,561 --> 01:20:40,660
That's why I worked even harder during practice.

1431
01:20:41,061 --> 01:20:42,891
My loss hurt my pride.

1432
01:20:43,090 --> 01:20:44,901
That made me work harder.

1433
01:20:45,401 --> 01:20:48,300
I believe we could be at a disadvantage,

1434
01:20:48,771 --> 01:20:52,700
but our team is filled with people who want to prove themselves.

1435
01:20:53,141 --> 01:20:55,670
I think we still have a chance to win.

1436
01:20:56,471 --> 01:20:59,781
My head is filled with spite.

1437
01:21:01,351 --> 01:21:02,910
She has this easy-going charm.

1438
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:05,049
(What are you doing, Sieun?)

1439
01:21:05,050 --> 01:21:06,151
Sieun gets a bit weird...

1440
01:21:06,651 --> 01:21:08,620
when it gets past midnight.

1441
01:21:09,351 --> 01:21:11,220
She becomes more energetic as time goes by.

1442
01:21:11,221 --> 01:21:12,589
At first, she's like this.

1443
01:21:12,590 --> 01:21:14,329
(During the day, she's quiet.)

1444
01:21:14,330 --> 01:21:15,330
Then, all of a sudden...

1445
01:21:15,331 --> 01:21:18,231
(Her energy levels shoot up at night.)

1446
01:21:18,861 --> 01:21:21,200
(Raise the energy levels!)

1447
01:21:24,741 --> 01:21:25,799
(1 day before the Revenge Battle, interim check with ITZY)

1448
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:27,370
May we see the performance?

1449
01:21:27,510 --> 01:21:28,611
- Yes. - Yes.

1450
01:21:49,031 --> 01:21:50,730
That was great.

1451
01:21:50,731 --> 01:21:52,731
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1452
01:21:52,931 --> 01:21:53,999
- What? - What?

1453
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,000
They're great.

1454
01:21:56,971 --> 01:21:58,200
Are you really the Challengers?

1455
01:21:58,870 --> 01:22:00,810
- Aren't you the Winners? - I thought you were the Winners.

1456
01:22:00,811 --> 01:22:02,210
I thought you were the Winners.

1457
01:22:02,710 --> 01:22:03,710
Seriously.

1458
01:22:04,010 --> 01:22:05,210
Everything was spot on.

1459
01:22:05,781 --> 01:22:06,909
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1460
01:22:06,910 --> 01:22:09,280
It was spot on. You must've practiced really hard.

1461
01:22:09,281 --> 01:22:11,681
This song caught me by surprise.

1462
01:22:12,851 --> 01:22:16,220
I thought this song would be...

1463
01:22:16,221 --> 01:22:20,991
less sparkling than "Red Flavor."

1464
01:22:21,090 --> 01:22:22,129
It was this part.

1465
01:22:22,130 --> 01:22:24,930
(The perfect choreography boosted the sparkling levels.)

1466
01:22:24,931 --> 01:22:27,431
The team balance seems really good as well.

1467
01:22:27,601 --> 01:22:28,770
You all worked as a team.

1468
01:22:28,771 --> 01:22:32,040
That really impressed me, and you girls did really well.

1469
01:22:32,540 --> 01:22:34,110
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1470
01:22:34,111 --> 01:22:35,111
I'm serious.

1471
01:22:35,112 --> 01:22:36,471
They practiced really hard.

1472
01:22:36,641 --> 01:22:40,040
This is how practice should be done.

1473
01:22:41,111 --> 01:22:43,010
It was the Revenge Battle,

1474
01:22:43,210 --> 01:22:45,481
but it was done as a team.

1475
01:22:45,651 --> 01:22:48,351
I felt proud when she said we worked as a team.

1476
01:22:48,590 --> 01:22:51,691
We worked really hard and practiced a lot.

1477
01:22:51,821 --> 01:22:53,290
I think we can win.

1478
01:22:53,830 --> 01:22:55,630
I'm determined this time.

1479
01:22:55,991 --> 01:22:59,260
I will work 100 times harder than before.

1480
01:22:59,401 --> 01:23:00,970
I want to show Unicorn Younha...

1481
01:23:00,971 --> 01:23:04,200
a completely different performance from the 1-on-1 Battle.

1482
01:23:08,311 --> 01:23:10,040
- Hey! - Hey!

1483
01:23:10,981 --> 01:23:12,040
Let's do this!

1484
01:23:13,681 --> 01:23:17,680
With a perfect performance with my teammates,

1485
01:23:17,681 --> 01:23:19,620
I want to complete my revenge.

1486
01:23:20,181 --> 01:23:23,590
(What kind of performance will the Sparkling Challengers show?)

1487
01:23:24,463 --> 01:23:28,433
With a perfect performance with my teammates,

1488
01:23:28,447 --> 01:23:30,416
I want to complete my revenge.

1489
01:23:30,431 --> 01:23:34,071
I will get my revenge against Yeojin.

1490
01:23:36,095 --> 01:23:40,195
("Dolphin" by OH MY GIRL)

1491
01:24:02,156 --> 01:24:03,156
Seriously...

1492
01:25:38,015 --> 01:25:39,015
That's so cute.

1493
01:25:39,016 --> 01:25:41,656
(That's so cute.)

1494
01:26:15,326 --> 01:26:16,355
They're so good.

1495
01:26:19,595 --> 01:26:20,626
They're so good.

1496
01:26:22,826 --> 01:26:24,365
They're really good.

1497
01:26:24,366 --> 01:26:26,336
They're great.

1498
01:26:31,605 --> 01:26:33,906
How are they this good?

1499
01:26:34,145 --> 01:26:35,775
- This team was great. - Right.

1500
01:26:35,975 --> 01:26:37,515
They don't seem like the Challengers.

1501
01:26:38,945 --> 01:26:41,216
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1502
01:26:43,116 --> 01:26:45,415
I can't get my eyes off of her.

1503
01:26:45,416 --> 01:26:46,484
Who is she?

1504
01:26:46,485 --> 01:26:48,756
- The one with the bob. - Right.

1505
01:26:49,025 --> 01:26:50,555
She drives me crazy.

1506
01:26:50,855 --> 01:26:52,925
- She has her own charm. - She dances around like a robot.

1507
01:26:52,926 --> 01:26:54,326
But it's so charming.

1508
01:26:56,326 --> 01:26:59,195
I enjoyed the performance by Sparkling Challengers.

1509
01:26:59,635 --> 01:27:03,434
It made me think that they weren't the Challengers.

1510
01:27:03,435 --> 01:27:05,336
- Right. - Yes. They were great.

1511
01:27:05,435 --> 01:27:07,844
I loved Sieun's expressions.

1512
01:27:07,845 --> 01:27:10,205
- Thank you. - It was so bubbly.

1513
01:27:10,206 --> 01:27:11,746
You were just like a dolphin.

1514
01:27:11,975 --> 01:27:13,546
Why is she so pretty?

1515
01:27:13,645 --> 01:27:15,046
Minari.

1516
01:27:15,416 --> 01:27:18,156
I heard the gun move was for me.

1517
01:27:20,685 --> 01:27:23,384
(I got caught.)

1518
01:27:23,385 --> 01:27:26,225
You'll need to work on that gun.

1519
01:27:27,595 --> 01:27:29,695
It wasn't strong enough to go through me.

1520
01:27:31,895 --> 01:27:32,966
Well...

1521
01:27:33,366 --> 01:27:35,604
Wasn't Eunchae really good?

1522
01:27:35,605 --> 01:27:37,604
Why did you sing "Comet?"

1523
01:27:37,605 --> 01:27:39,135
This is your specialty.

1524
01:27:39,406 --> 01:27:41,405
- Exactly. - I was really surprised.

1525
01:27:41,406 --> 01:27:44,375
The singing was really stable.

1526
01:27:44,376 --> 01:27:45,844
- Right. - Even the dancing.

1527
01:27:45,845 --> 01:27:49,315
She really took her spot when she was in the center.

1528
01:27:54,385 --> 01:27:55,826
She was shining.

1529
01:27:56,086 --> 01:27:57,855
- Thank you. - You did really well.

1530
01:27:58,756 --> 01:28:00,595
Eunchae just did really well.

1531
01:28:01,195 --> 01:28:02,426
She was on another level.

1532
01:28:02,725 --> 01:28:04,665
I'm really excited for what is to come.

1533
01:28:04,666 --> 01:28:08,035
Eunchae hasn't shown us everything she has.

1534
01:28:08,036 --> 01:28:10,165
She still has a lot more to show.

1535
01:28:10,166 --> 01:28:11,576
Don't cry!

1536
01:28:11,935 --> 01:28:13,435
Don't cry!

1537
01:28:13,635 --> 01:28:16,076
- Don't cry! - Great work!

1538
01:28:18,216 --> 01:28:19,444
- Thank you. - You should've cried...

1539
01:28:19,445 --> 01:28:22,185
while singing "Comet." Why cry now?

1540
01:28:24,916 --> 01:28:27,625
They already lost to us once.

1541
01:28:27,626 --> 01:28:29,456
I think we'll take the win.

1542
01:28:33,756 --> 01:28:34,796
They're great.

1543
01:28:36,895 --> 01:28:37,966
Gosh.

1544
01:28:38,195 --> 01:28:39,595
That was amazing.

1545
01:28:40,296 --> 01:28:41,506
They're a strong team.

1546
01:28:41,635 --> 01:28:43,634
It's a close match. They're so good.

1547
01:28:43,635 --> 01:28:47,546
Can our team win?

1548
01:28:47,805 --> 01:28:50,144
(Revenge or consecutive win)

1549
01:28:50,145 --> 01:28:52,716
(Which team will win this fierce battle?)

1550
01:28:52,876 --> 01:28:54,416
You did really well.

1551
01:28:57,246 --> 01:29:00,355
(What a shame. They both did so well.)

1552
01:29:00,926 --> 01:29:02,585
(I wanted to shine even more on that team.)

1553
01:29:02,586 --> 01:29:04,295
(I first got determined...)

1554
01:29:04,296 --> 01:29:07,025
(to advance to the Universe.)

1555
01:29:08,065 --> 01:29:09,296
Oh, no.

1556
01:29:09,866 --> 01:29:12,865
(To be honest, we weren't like a team.)

1557
01:29:12,866 --> 01:29:16,906
(If we were to carry on like this...)

1558
01:29:17,235 --> 01:29:19,576
(Can we beat the Challengers?)

1559
01:29:20,376 --> 01:29:23,145
(Sujin, can I talk with you?)

1560
01:29:24,546 --> 01:29:27,845
(I know you're really up for this.)

1561
01:29:28,916 --> 01:29:30,515
(It could look a bit selfish.)

1562
01:29:30,815 --> 01:29:32,385
(Can you match my position?)

1563
01:29:33,256 --> 01:29:34,955
(With the eagerness to win, )

1564
01:29:34,956 --> 01:29:37,326
(the leaders feel that much more pressure.)

1565
01:29:39,025 --> 01:29:42,626
(What will the girls' tenacity result in?)

1566
01:29:44,666 --> 01:29:46,635
(The Challengers' will shocks everyone.)

1567
01:29:48,006 --> 01:29:50,064
(The Winners must protect their title.)

1568
01:29:50,065 --> 01:29:51,235
I got goosebumps.

1569
01:29:51,635 --> 01:29:53,506
(I get why this is the last battle.)

1570
01:29:53,635 --> 01:29:55,376
(Who will become the winner of the last Revenge Battle?)

1571
01:29:56,206 --> 01:29:58,216
(Finally)

1572
01:29:58,676 --> 01:30:00,076
(The survivors of Battle Week)

1573
01:30:00,616 --> 01:30:03,515
(20 direct advancements and 21 top ticketing rankers)

1574
01:30:03,916 --> 01:30:06,786
(The 41 girls of the Universe will be revealed.)

1575
01:30:07,685 --> 01:30:09,656
