(who are right before making their debuts.)

3
00:00:06,297 --> 00:00:08,196
To become K-pop girl group members,

4
00:00:08,197 --> 00:00:10,996
a total of 82 girls have gathered in Korea from all over the world.

5
00:00:11,897 --> 00:00:13,436
Out of these 82 girls,

6
00:00:13,437 --> 00:00:16,406
only eight girls will make it to the final global stage.

7
00:00:17,237 --> 00:00:19,237
(Universe Ticket)

8
00:01:46,457 --> 00:01:48,826
The one to get a promotion from the Performance Unit is...

9
00:01:49,466 --> 00:01:50,727
Narumi.

10
00:01:51,196 --> 00:01:53,536
- Thank you. - You have been promoted to Level I.

11
00:01:53,537 --> 00:01:54,567
Congratulations.

12
00:01:58,907 --> 00:02:00,667
The member promoted in the Visual Unit is...

13
00:02:01,377 --> 00:02:02,606
Kotoko.

14
00:02:14,516 --> 00:02:16,556
The person getting promoted in the Vocal Unit is...

15
00:02:16,757 --> 00:02:17,926
Lim Seowon.

16
00:02:18,657 --> 00:02:20,496
- You've been promoted to Level R. - Thank you.

17
00:02:20,497 --> 00:02:21,497
Congratulations.

18
00:02:23,127 --> 00:02:25,866
I will make sure to reach Level P.

19
00:02:27,037 --> 00:02:28,695
(This program is a story of 24 girls...)

20
00:02:28,696 --> 00:02:30,416
(who are right before making their debuts.)

21
00:02:31,407 --> 00:02:33,436
(Debut)

22
00:02:33,437 --> 00:02:37,076

(Unit Station, 5 minutes before recording)

24
00:02:43,187 --> 00:02:47,986
(The girls get ready for the last performance before the Finals.)

25
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:49,626
We're almost at the end.

26
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:50,657
- Right. - Right.

27
00:02:52,997 --> 00:02:57,165
Unit Station, the New Song Unit performances will begin.

28
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:59,796
(Unit Station's final battle, New Song Unit)

29
00:02:59,997 --> 00:03:02,067
Let's have everyone on the stage.

30
00:03:06,507 --> 00:03:07,537
Good luck!

31
00:03:11,146 --> 00:03:12,747
Hello.

32
00:03:13,247 --> 00:03:17,847
- Hello. - Hello.

33
00:03:20,787 --> 00:03:23,727
(The 24 girls who have advanced to Unit Station)

34
00:03:24,087 --> 00:03:26,527
We already have only this many girls left.

35
00:03:27,227 --> 00:03:29,126
This is everyone?

36
00:03:29,127 --> 00:03:30,166
Yes.

37
00:03:35,437 --> 00:03:38,636
(What is the 24 girls' New Song Unit mission?)

38
00:03:39,807 --> 00:03:41,777
(New Song Unit, D-14)

39
00:03:44,206 --> 00:03:48,645
(The girls have been invited to an empty practice room.)

40
00:03:48,646 --> 00:03:50,116
My gosh.

41
00:03:50,546 --> 00:03:52,187
- What's going on? - What?

42
00:03:53,187 --> 00:03:54,187
- What? - What are we doing?

43
00:03:54,188 --> 00:03:55,455
Why are we here?

44
00:03:55,456 --> 00:03:59,227
(Meanwhile, other girls have been invited to another place.)

45
00:04:00,027 --> 00:04:01,956
- Why are we here? - What is this?

46
00:04:03,296 --> 00:04:05,096
- Nizi! - Hi!

47
00:04:05,097 --> 00:04:06,165
- She's here. - What?

48
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:07,235
Hey!

49
00:04:07,236 --> 00:04:09,236
- Hi. - Hi.

50
00:04:09,837 --> 00:04:10,866
What's going on?

51
00:04:11,366 --> 00:04:12,407
What is this?

52
00:04:13,477 --> 00:04:15,337
What kind of group is this?

53
00:04:15,477 --> 00:04:17,207
I really couldn't guess what was going on.

54
00:04:18,077 --> 00:04:19,375
Why have we been separated like this?

55
00:04:19,376 --> 00:04:20,892
(Another practice room making guesses)

56
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:22,787
We had a variety of different girls.

57
00:04:22,947 --> 00:04:25,587
So I thought to myself, "What's going on?"

58
00:04:28,957 --> 00:04:30,456
- What? - Who is it?

59
00:04:30,457 --> 00:04:31,457
Hold on.

60
00:04:33,126 --> 00:04:34,355
Hello.

61
00:04:34,356 --> 00:04:36,402
(Producer ADORA from VENDORS makes a surprise visit.)

62
00:04:36,426 --> 00:04:38,065
- Hello. - Hello.

63
00:04:38,066 --> 00:04:39,097
Hello.

64
00:04:39,436 --> 00:04:41,065
- Hello. - Hello.

65
00:04:41,066 --> 00:04:42,096
(Producer Nano from VENDORS visits the other practice room.)

66
00:04:42,097 --> 00:04:43,565
Hello.

67
00:04:43,566 --> 00:04:48,436
(Why have VENDORS visited them before Unit Station?)

68
00:04:48,876 --> 00:04:52,006
I have prepared a surprise gift...

69
00:04:52,717 --> 00:04:53,976
for all of you.

70
00:04:53,977 --> 00:04:55,116
A new song?

71
00:04:55,847 --> 00:05:00,856
The surprise gift from VENDORS.

72
00:05:01,087 --> 00:05:02,485
- The gift is... - Gift!

73
00:05:02,486 --> 00:05:04,157
- Gift. - This time...

74
00:05:04,686 --> 00:05:07,656
It's the new song for the second performance...

75
00:05:07,657 --> 00:05:10,596
of Unit Station, New Song Unit.

76
00:05:10,597 --> 00:05:12,226
(A new song gift just for New Song Unit)

77
00:05:12,227 --> 00:05:13,435
It's a new song for you.

78
00:05:13,436 --> 00:05:16,767
(A new song gift just for New Song Unit)

79
00:05:17,106 --> 00:05:20,436
Only the ones in the higher ranks got a new song.

80
00:05:20,676 --> 00:05:22,196
I was really jealous of them for that.

81
00:05:22,376 --> 00:05:25,847
The new song was totally unexpected.

82
00:05:26,077 --> 00:05:29,186
I was really surprised because it was unexpected.

83
00:05:30,217 --> 00:05:31,287
New song?

84
00:05:31,947 --> 00:05:33,416
It sounded like fun.

85
00:05:33,887 --> 00:05:37,056
The title of the new song that you will perform.

86
00:05:37,327 --> 00:05:38,327
It's...

87
00:05:38,328 --> 00:05:40,226
(Half-worried)

88
00:05:40,227 --> 00:05:41,227
It's...

89
00:05:41,228 --> 00:05:43,126
(Half-excited)

90
00:05:43,227 --> 00:05:44,966
It's "Dream Girl."

91
00:05:44,967 --> 00:05:46,896
- "Dream Girl." - It's "Dream Girl."

92
00:05:46,897 --> 00:05:48,236
- "Dream Girl." - "Dream Girl."

93
00:05:48,467 --> 00:05:50,427
I'll tell you the title first. This is the title.

94
00:05:51,606 --> 00:05:52,805
"Yummy Yum."

95
00:05:52,806 --> 00:05:54,005
(The second new song, "Yummy Yum")

96
00:05:54,006 --> 00:05:55,076
"Yummy Yum?"

97
00:05:55,077 --> 00:05:56,706
- You will split into 2 units... - You will split into 2 units...

98
00:05:56,707 --> 00:05:58,852
- and compete against each other. - and compete against each other.

99
00:05:58,876 --> 00:06:00,416
Through New Song Unit,

100
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:04,115
there will be no promotions. There will only be elimination.

101
00:06:04,116 --> 00:06:05,447
(There will only be elimination.)

102
00:06:05,787 --> 00:06:07,985
There will only be elimination.

103
00:06:07,986 --> 00:06:09,086
Elimination?

104
00:06:09,087 --> 00:06:10,587
Come on!

105
00:06:10,926 --> 00:06:14,697
This is indeed Universe Ticket. Nothing is easy here.

106
00:06:14,827 --> 00:06:18,397
I thought I could be the one to get eliminated.

107
00:06:18,996 --> 00:06:20,537
Things looked bad for me.

108
00:06:21,537 --> 00:06:23,037
The number of eliminations...

109
00:06:26,106 --> 00:06:28,867
- It will be revealed on that day. - It will be revealed on that day.

110
00:06:29,876 --> 00:06:31,776
(What will happen to the girls?)

111
00:06:31,777 --> 00:06:32,816
What do we do?

112
00:06:33,816 --> 00:06:35,046
New Song Unit...

113
00:06:35,647 --> 00:06:38,217
will be performed by two units.

114
00:06:38,587 --> 00:06:41,555
Through this round of performances,

115
00:06:41,556 --> 00:06:43,756
elimination will occur before the Final Station.

116
00:06:45,027 --> 00:06:47,256
The number of eliminations from New Song Unit.

117
00:06:47,957 --> 00:06:49,267
Is it being revealed now?

118
00:06:51,767 --> 00:06:53,236
From each unit,

119
00:06:55,637 --> 00:06:56,665
one person will get eliminated.

120
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,476
(One person from each unit will get eliminated.)

121
00:06:59,477 --> 00:07:00,537
One person?

122
00:07:00,577 --> 00:07:02,647
- One person. - One person.

123
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,106
One?

124
00:07:07,376 --> 00:07:09,946
(Two people will get eliminated from New Song Unit.)

125
00:07:09,947 --> 00:07:12,545
However, the ones to get eliminated...

126
00:07:12,546 --> 00:07:14,856
won't be decided just by the Unicorns.

127
00:07:14,887 --> 00:07:16,957
(Someone else will also decide the eliminations.)

128
00:07:17,957 --> 00:07:19,457
How will it be decided?

129
00:07:20,657 --> 00:07:23,566
The Unicorns, producers,

130
00:07:24,827 --> 00:07:25,897
and...

131
00:07:27,337 --> 00:07:32,006
(The unknown decider makes them feel anxious.)

132
00:07:32,637 --> 00:07:36,106
the opposing contestants make the decision.

133
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,946
(The contestants must select each other for elimination.)

134
00:07:39,947 --> 00:07:41,116
- No way. - What?

135
00:07:42,017 --> 00:07:43,086
What do we do?

136
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:45,847
(The contestants must select each other for elimination.)

137
00:07:45,947 --> 00:07:48,017
It was groundbreaking.

138
00:07:48,587 --> 00:07:51,626
I didn't expect that we would have to make the decision.

139
00:07:51,727 --> 00:07:53,296
I was very surprised.

140
00:07:53,657 --> 00:07:56,596
The Unicorns, producers, and contestants...

141
00:07:56,597 --> 00:07:58,926
will each select a candidate for elimination.

142
00:07:59,126 --> 00:08:01,267
If a contestant gets two votes or more,

143
00:08:01,537 --> 00:08:02,935
they will get eliminated right away.

144
00:08:02,936 --> 00:08:05,735
(A contestant with two or more votes will get eliminated right away.)

145
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:08,005
If the Unicorns, producers, and contestants...

146
00:08:08,006 --> 00:08:10,276
each choose different candidates,

147
00:08:10,277 --> 00:08:11,946
the three candidates...

148
00:08:11,947 --> 00:08:15,146
will compete against each other with individual performances.

149
00:08:15,147 --> 00:08:16,546
Individual performances?

150
00:08:17,486 --> 00:08:18,587
Individual performances?

151
00:08:18,947 --> 00:08:22,416
Let's meet the first New Song Unit.

152
00:08:22,657 --> 00:08:23,855
"Dream Girl."

153
00:08:23,856 --> 00:08:27,295
("Dream Girl" Unit)

154
00:08:27,296 --> 00:08:28,296
Let's go.

155
00:08:28,297 --> 00:08:30,626
(The "Yummy Yum" Unit heads to the seats.)

156
00:08:33,297 --> 00:08:35,265
This was totally unexpected.

157
00:08:35,266 --> 00:08:36,905
(They must select a candidate for elimination after watching.)

158
00:08:36,906 --> 00:08:38,236
Oh, no.

159
00:08:38,606 --> 00:08:41,105
I didn't expect it to be from the other team.

160
00:08:41,106 --> 00:08:42,106
Same here.

161
00:08:42,107 --> 00:08:43,776
They must feel super nervous.

162
00:08:44,307 --> 00:08:45,876
Seriously.

163
00:08:46,746 --> 00:08:49,417
- Gosh. What do we do? - What do we do?

164
00:08:50,717 --> 00:08:53,686
They must feel a lot more nervous.

165
00:08:53,687 --> 00:08:54,886
Exactly.

166
00:08:56,016 --> 00:08:59,057
- They must vote for each other. - Right.

167
00:08:59,396 --> 00:09:01,996
Please introduce the "Dream Girl" Unit.

168
00:09:02,057 --> 00:09:03,096
Okay.

169
00:09:03,097 --> 00:09:04,265
Two, three.

170
00:09:04,266 --> 00:09:07,035
- PRISM is our dream. - PRISM is our dream.

171
00:09:07,036 --> 00:09:09,166
- Hello. We're... - Hello. We're...

172
00:09:09,167 --> 00:09:12,837
- the Dream Girls. - the Dream Girls.

173
00:09:13,776 --> 00:09:14,906
How cute.

174
00:09:15,106 --> 00:09:16,447
They're the Dream Girls.

175
00:09:17,906 --> 00:09:19,447
- Yoona. - Yes?

176
00:09:19,577 --> 00:09:21,916
It's your first time singing a new song.

177
00:09:21,917 --> 00:09:24,347
What were some of the difficulties that you faced?

178
00:09:24,547 --> 00:09:28,255
The notes were quite high for me.

179
00:09:28,256 --> 00:09:30,656
That was the hardest part.

180
00:09:31,356 --> 00:09:34,457
(What is the new song that troubled the "Dream Girl" Unit?)

181
00:09:35,126 --> 00:09:38,125
("Dream Girl" Unit, first meeting)

182
00:09:38,126 --> 00:09:39,836
Shall we listen to it right away?

183
00:09:39,837 --> 00:09:42,035
- Yes! That sounds good. - Yes! That sounds good.

184
00:09:42,036 --> 00:09:45,707
(They're all excited to listen to the new song.)

185
00:09:48,006 --> 00:09:53,376
(The song expresses the girls' desperateness for their dreams.)

186
00:09:53,516 --> 00:09:57,116
(The song contains dreamy and sentimental high notes.)

187
00:10:00,217 --> 00:10:01,586
How was the song?

188
00:10:01,587 --> 00:10:03,156
- It was great! - It was great!

189
00:10:03,827 --> 00:10:06,156
- I love it! - It's great!

190
00:10:06,396 --> 00:10:07,926
When I heard just the first verse,

191
00:10:07,927 --> 00:10:11,467
I thought I could pull it off quite well.

192
00:10:11,626 --> 00:10:13,836
But when I heard the chorus,

193
00:10:13,837 --> 00:10:15,395
the notes seemed really high.

194
00:10:15,396 --> 00:10:18,536
I doubted if I could pull it off.

195
00:10:18,807 --> 00:10:20,976
After listening to the song,

196
00:10:20,977 --> 00:10:23,746
my mind went blank.

197
00:10:24,106 --> 00:10:27,717
The song felt difficult for me.

198
00:10:28,447 --> 00:10:29,746
It's too high.

199
00:10:29,986 --> 00:10:31,047
It's really hard.

200
00:10:31,317 --> 00:10:34,856
(Lim Seowon gives it a try too.)

201
00:10:35,116 --> 00:10:36,886
When my wounds heal?

202
00:10:37,057 --> 00:10:38,125
This won't work.

203
00:10:38,126 --> 00:10:40,496
This song that flows

204
00:10:41,026 --> 00:10:45,026
(The high notes of the song trouble even Elisia.)

205
00:10:45,097 --> 00:10:47,096
It was a bit high, so it was out of my vocal range.

206
00:10:47,097 --> 00:10:50,467
I have a naturally lower tone.

207
00:10:50,636 --> 00:10:52,405
What do I do?

208
00:10:52,406 --> 00:10:55,477
("Dream Girl" seems to be a very difficult song.)

209
00:10:56,077 --> 00:10:57,706
- It's hard. - It's hard, isn't it?

210
00:10:57,707 --> 00:11:00,145
- The notes are too high. - Sorry?

211
00:11:00,146 --> 00:11:01,826
- Right? The notes are really high. - Yes.

212
00:11:03,986 --> 00:11:06,385
- Hello. - Hello.

213
00:11:06,386 --> 00:11:07,485
(Vocal lesson for the struggling "Dream Girl" Unit)

214
00:11:07,486 --> 00:11:10,885
I'm here as the teacher to help with "Dream Girl."

215
00:11:10,886 --> 00:11:12,256
I'm Baek So Hee.

216
00:11:12,896 --> 00:11:15,427
- Hello. - Hello.

217
00:11:15,557 --> 00:11:19,735
Will my dream come true when my tears dry up?

218
00:11:19,736 --> 00:11:23,966
Will everything be fine when my wounds heal?

219
00:11:23,967 --> 00:11:26,307
Elisia has a lot of power.

220
00:11:26,506 --> 00:11:27,605
- Sorry? - Power.

221
00:11:27,606 --> 00:11:30,146
- Thank you. - Your voice is nice and loud.

222
00:11:30,807 --> 00:11:32,177
I love your voice.

223
00:11:32,347 --> 00:11:34,376
"The wind." Like this.

224
00:11:35,116 --> 00:11:38,416
(Whenever she receives feedback, )

225
00:11:38,417 --> 00:11:40,716
(she fixes it right away.)

226
00:11:40,717 --> 00:11:41,785
Just like that.

227
00:11:41,786 --> 00:11:42,956
Let's try it again.

228
00:11:42,957 --> 00:11:46,926
The times that felt like dreams

229
00:11:46,927 --> 00:11:47,995
Breathe right here.

230
00:11:47,996 --> 00:11:51,126
(The contestants learn the song quite well.)

231
00:11:51,197 --> 00:11:53,036
That was great.

232
00:11:53,567 --> 00:11:56,365
(The lesson for Nana's part continues.)

233
00:11:56,366 --> 00:11:57,366
Use your lips.

234
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:01,275
(Trying her best)

235
00:12:01,276 --> 00:12:03,207
The wind

236
00:12:03,246 --> 00:12:05,807
Nana, you should also let out your voice the opposite way.

237
00:12:05,847 --> 00:12:07,216
- Right. - Gather up your voice.

238
00:12:07,217 --> 00:12:09,276
- Don't force it out. This way. - Right.

239
00:12:09,516 --> 00:12:11,745
Do you each remember the feedback given to you?

240
00:12:11,746 --> 00:12:12,746
- Yes. - Yes.

241
00:12:12,747 --> 00:12:15,416
There needs to be a lot more.

242
00:12:15,417 --> 00:12:18,086
- Right. - It needs to sound more exciting.

243
00:12:18,087 --> 00:12:20,296
- Yes. - In terms of the rhythm and sound.

244
00:12:20,297 --> 00:12:21,557
- Right. - Right.

245
00:12:22,227 --> 00:12:23,227
(The next day, recording studio for "Dream Girl")

246
00:12:23,228 --> 00:12:25,125
- Hello. - Hello.

247
00:12:25,126 --> 00:12:26,396
- We'll start. - Okay.

248
00:12:26,636 --> 00:12:28,765
(Lim Seowon starts recording first.)

249
00:12:28,766 --> 00:12:30,405
That's it. Let's start.

250
00:12:30,406 --> 00:12:31,406
Okay.

251
00:12:31,407 --> 00:12:35,437
Will my dream come true when my tears dry up?

252
00:12:35,977 --> 00:12:37,505
That's nice. Let's move on.

253
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:38,506
Thank you.

254
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:40,876
This feels like coding. She gets everything that's input.

255
00:12:42,847 --> 00:12:46,457
(It's Elisia's turn this time.)

256
00:12:46,856 --> 00:12:51,087
(She hits the high notes perfectly.)

257
00:12:51,587 --> 00:12:53,396
She's so good. What's going on?

258
00:12:55,256 --> 00:12:56,967
- Gosh. - We can use this right away.

259
00:12:57,197 --> 00:12:58,797
Right. Eli, you're done!

260
00:12:59,026 --> 00:13:01,036
- Eli, you're good! - Thank you!

261
00:13:01,736 --> 00:13:05,707
(It's Yuri's session next.)

262
00:13:10,477 --> 00:13:11,576
You're doing great.

263
00:13:11,577 --> 00:13:12,605
- Nice! - Thank you.

264
00:13:12,606 --> 00:13:13,876
How is she this good?

265
00:13:14,047 --> 00:13:15,547
I like it. Pass!

266
00:13:15,776 --> 00:13:18,986
(Nana is up next.)

267
00:13:29,097 --> 00:13:31,227
(Thinking)

268
00:13:35,197 --> 00:13:36,297
First...

269
00:13:36,837 --> 00:13:38,005
- Nana. - Yes?

270
00:13:38,006 --> 00:13:39,905
- We'll try it again. - Right.

271
00:13:39,906 --> 00:13:43,446
You sound very unconfident right now.

272
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:46,146
- Let's try it with more confidence. - Okay.

273
00:13:48,817 --> 00:13:51,087
(Her voice still sounds unconfident.)

274
00:13:52,786 --> 00:13:54,486
A bit more than just now.

275
00:13:54,756 --> 00:13:57,155
Even if you sound weaker,

276
00:13:57,156 --> 00:13:58,625
I think you need to get the notes right.

277
00:13:58,626 --> 00:14:00,227
- Let's try that. - Okay.

278
00:14:00,626 --> 00:14:04,727
(She tries singing it again.)

279
00:14:11,106 --> 00:14:12,707
- Let's try again. - Yes.

280
00:14:14,236 --> 00:14:16,276
(The notes continue to sound weak and out of tune.)

281
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,875
- I don't know what to do here. - Right.

282
00:14:19,876 --> 00:14:21,276
It sounds off.

283
00:14:21,746 --> 00:14:23,716
Right. It won't be easy.

284
00:14:23,717 --> 00:14:25,117
This one will be hard to work with.

285
00:14:26,957 --> 00:14:29,516
I don't think she can hit the notes.

286
00:14:30,927 --> 00:14:33,956
I did much worse than I did during practice.

287
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:35,496
I felt really bad.

288
00:14:42,996 --> 00:14:44,337
All right.

289
00:14:45,006 --> 00:14:48,177
Everyone did very well.

290
00:14:48,477 --> 00:14:51,546
But the one who couldn't get the recording done today...

291
00:14:51,547 --> 00:14:52,906
is Nana.

292
00:14:53,146 --> 00:14:56,446
We decided to stop because we thought it wouldn't work today.

293
00:14:56,447 --> 00:14:57,486
Right.

294
00:14:58,317 --> 00:15:00,557
- Did you practice? - Yes.

295
00:15:00,687 --> 00:15:02,056
But why couldn't you do it today?

296
00:15:02,057 --> 00:15:04,227
(But why couldn't you do it today?)

297
00:15:07,626 --> 00:15:10,396
If you practiced, I'm supposed to see that.

298
00:15:11,067 --> 00:15:14,336
I can tell you didn't practice as much as the other members.

299
00:15:14,337 --> 00:15:15,567
I need you...

300
00:15:15,736 --> 00:15:17,967
- to practice even more. - Okay.

301
00:15:18,266 --> 00:15:19,337
All right?

302
00:15:19,707 --> 00:15:21,336
If you keep doing it like this,

303
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,076
I can't give you a part.

304
00:15:23,077 --> 00:15:25,277
(If you keep doing it like this, I can't give you a part.)

305
00:15:28,817 --> 00:15:30,046
I understand she's upset.

306
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:33,217
But this is where she needs...

307
00:15:35,817 --> 00:15:38,187
to prove herself.

308
00:15:40,756 --> 00:15:41,995
Are you all right?

309
00:15:41,996 --> 00:15:43,227
Thank you.

310
00:15:56,406 --> 00:16:00,917
When I heard what the producer said during the recording,

311
00:16:01,376 --> 00:16:03,386
I was very sad.

312
00:16:03,417 --> 00:16:06,286
I was close to tears when Nana started crying.

313
00:16:06,347 --> 00:16:08,115
Because Nana asked...

314
00:16:08,116 --> 00:16:10,756
a lot of questions to me and Gyoryeon.

315
00:16:11,986 --> 00:16:14,856
I know she worked really hard.

316
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,827
It's not that she didn't practice.

317
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,036
Considering the image of the song,

318
00:16:27,307 --> 00:16:29,677
I think Nana is the best fit.

319
00:16:29,776 --> 00:16:33,577
And I believe she's the best dancer for this song.

320
00:16:33,947 --> 00:16:36,447
Once she gains confidence,

321
00:16:36,547 --> 00:16:39,786
I'm sure she will pull it off perfectly.

322
00:16:43,057 --> 00:16:46,227
I really want to do well,

323
00:16:46,386 --> 00:16:48,256
so I'll work hard.

324
00:16:48,297 --> 00:16:52,626
I'll try to sing and dance better.

325
00:16:53,297 --> 00:16:56,337
Please wait a little more.

326
00:16:56,437 --> 00:16:58,636
Good work. Thank you.

327
00:16:58,837 --> 00:16:59,936
Bye.

328
00:16:59,937 --> 00:17:02,297
(Nana stays bright and keeps practicing without giving up.)

329
00:17:02,506 --> 00:17:06,346
(She keeps practicing without a break.)

330
00:17:07,177 --> 00:17:08,616
(The day of interim evaluation has come.)

331
00:17:08,617 --> 00:17:10,045
- Oh, my gosh. - I'm scared.

332
00:17:10,046 --> 00:17:11,186
- Let's go. - I'm so nervous.

333
00:17:11,187 --> 00:17:13,117
For the New Song Unit,

334
00:17:13,147 --> 00:17:15,417
each unit will perform first.

335
00:17:15,717 --> 00:17:18,727
Then you will pick one member each whom you think will be eliminated...

336
00:17:18,927 --> 00:17:22,055
from your own unit and the opposing unit.

337
00:17:22,056 --> 00:17:23,366
- What? - My own unit?

338
00:17:23,367 --> 00:17:24,367
Even from my unit?

339
00:17:24,368 --> 00:17:25,495
- What? - What?

340
00:17:25,496 --> 00:17:26,596
From my unit?

341
00:17:26,967 --> 00:17:28,535
(Each unit will perform, and they will pick one member...)

342
00:17:28,536 --> 00:17:30,305
(from each unit whom they think will be eliminated.)

343
00:17:30,306 --> 00:17:31,335
- This is cruel. - My gosh.

344
00:17:31,336 --> 00:17:32,535
- This is crazy. - It's so cruel.

345
00:17:32,536 --> 00:17:34,107
Even from my unit? I can't pick one.

346
00:17:34,177 --> 00:17:36,576
How would I pick a member of my own unit?

347
00:17:37,447 --> 00:17:39,006
I didn't see this coming.

348
00:17:39,147 --> 00:17:44,316
My team members are well-aware how we've practiced.

349
00:17:44,586 --> 00:17:46,285
That's why I was even more worried.

350
00:17:46,286 --> 00:17:48,157
My heart is pounding.

351
00:17:49,387 --> 00:17:50,486
Two and three.

352
00:17:50,526 --> 00:17:52,755
- Hello. We are... - Hello. We are...

353
00:17:52,756 --> 00:17:55,256
- Dream Girls. - Dream Girls.

354
00:17:56,096 --> 00:17:57,266
They're adorable.

355
00:17:59,596 --> 00:18:03,835
Will my dream come true when my tears dry up?

356
00:18:03,836 --> 00:18:07,937
Will everything be fine when my wounds heal?

357
00:18:08,336 --> 00:18:11,576
I'm afraid it might not go as I expected

358
00:18:12,147 --> 00:18:17,417
(The performance continues smoothly.)

359
00:18:20,457 --> 00:18:24,227
(Hitting high notes easily)

360
00:18:26,026 --> 00:18:30,727
(They performed well without any serious mistakes.)

361
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:32,227
They're good.

362
00:18:33,197 --> 00:18:34,866
This is a difficult song to sing,

363
00:18:34,867 --> 00:18:36,307
and the dance moves are also tricky.

364
00:18:40,407 --> 00:18:44,207
(The vote for "Dream Girl" begins.)

365
00:18:44,506 --> 00:18:46,005
(The unit for "Yummy Yum" takes a vote first...)

366
00:18:46,006 --> 00:18:47,775
(on the member they expect to be eliminated.)

367
00:18:47,776 --> 00:18:49,076
"Dream Girl."

368
00:18:50,647 --> 00:18:52,016
Oh, my gosh.

369
00:19:01,357 --> 00:19:05,566
I'll pick this member.

370
00:19:06,197 --> 00:19:07,835
(Who does the opposing unit think will be eliminated?)

371
00:19:07,836 --> 00:19:09,266
I'll pick this member.

372
00:19:09,667 --> 00:19:11,107
I picked her.

373
00:19:11,736 --> 00:19:12,937
I'm sorry.

374
00:19:20,276 --> 00:19:21,376
It's our unit.

375
00:19:21,377 --> 00:19:22,676
(Now they take a vote on their own unit.)

376
00:19:22,677 --> 00:19:23,815
It's our unit.

377
00:19:23,816 --> 00:19:26,015
(Now they take a vote on their own unit.)

378
00:19:26,016 --> 00:19:27,056
My unit.

379
00:19:27,316 --> 00:19:28,555
It also has my name on it.

380
00:19:28,556 --> 00:19:29,755
I'm not used to this.

381
00:19:29,756 --> 00:19:31,356
(Now they take a vote on their own unit.)

382
00:19:31,357 --> 00:19:32,485
("Dream Girl")

383
00:19:32,486 --> 00:19:34,556
They are all really good.

384
00:19:43,096 --> 00:19:47,336
The contestant I think will be eliminated is...

385
00:19:54,617 --> 00:19:56,016
What do I do?

386
00:19:59,746 --> 00:20:04,556
(Who is the contestant chosen by the unit for "Dream Girl?")

387
00:20:08,697 --> 00:20:12,096
Now I will announce the members...

388
00:20:12,596 --> 00:20:13,996
- for possible elimination. - What?

389
00:20:15,197 --> 00:20:16,266
What?

390
00:20:16,397 --> 00:20:18,137
- Announce? - Oh, no.

391
00:20:19,036 --> 00:20:20,335
- Just like this? - What?

392
00:20:20,336 --> 00:20:21,906
- What do I do? - My gosh.

393
00:20:21,907 --> 00:20:23,707
(The lights are dimmed all of a sudden.)

394
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,907
(Flustered)

395
00:20:25,977 --> 00:20:28,845
(The screen rolls down slowly.)

396
00:20:28,846 --> 00:20:30,417
- What? - My goodness.

397
00:20:32,117 --> 00:20:34,286
I hope it's not for showing the result.

398
00:20:34,986 --> 00:20:36,956
What if the names pop up on the screen?

399
00:20:36,957 --> 00:20:38,786
It will be embarrassing.

400
00:20:39,326 --> 00:20:41,197
- Please. - Please save us.

401
00:20:41,256 --> 00:20:43,157
I don't want my name to be called.

402
00:20:44,367 --> 00:20:46,796
(They reveal the result with the videos of the contestants.)

403
00:20:48,036 --> 00:20:49,637
- Oh, no! - My gosh.

404
00:20:51,907 --> 00:20:53,607
- Oh, no! - My gosh.

405
00:20:55,536 --> 00:20:56,776
This is just too much.

406
00:20:58,276 --> 00:20:59,506
This is crazy.

407
00:21:00,546 --> 00:21:01,646
I think...

408
00:21:01,647 --> 00:21:03,416
(Members for possible elimination picked by Unit "Yummy Yum")

409
00:21:03,417 --> 00:21:05,745
The member I think will be eliminated is...

410
00:21:05,746 --> 00:21:06,986
We can't be doing this.

411
00:21:11,326 --> 00:21:13,626
The member I think will be eliminated is...

412
00:21:13,627 --> 00:21:15,496
Yona.

413
00:21:15,927 --> 00:21:17,066
Here's the reason.

414
00:21:17,296 --> 00:21:20,636
I could tell all the other members were trying to get...

415
00:21:20,637 --> 00:21:21,897
into the team spirit.

416
00:21:21,967 --> 00:21:24,967
But I don't think that was the case for Yona.

417
00:21:25,566 --> 00:21:27,536
So this is how it's announced.

418
00:21:29,177 --> 00:21:35,647
The member to be eliminated from the unit for "Dream Girl" is...

419
00:21:39,246 --> 00:21:41,687
Yona, I think.

420
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:43,417
For some reason,

421
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:47,095
I didn't find her so outstanding.

422
00:21:47,096 --> 00:21:48,897
Compared to the other members.

423
00:21:52,066 --> 00:21:54,137
I think it's Yona.

424
00:21:54,236 --> 00:21:55,496
As I watched their performance.

425
00:21:55,836 --> 00:21:59,166
- I tried to figure out... - I didn't think they'd play it.

426
00:21:59,167 --> 00:22:01,836
The least memorable member.

427
00:22:01,877 --> 00:22:03,437
And I found Yona...

428
00:22:03,746 --> 00:22:06,477
the least impressive compared to the other members.

429
00:22:07,046 --> 00:22:08,246
This is unbelievable.

430
00:22:09,576 --> 00:22:11,716
- It's Yona. - I picked Yona.

431
00:22:11,717 --> 00:22:13,677
(Yona got the most votes from the opposing unit.)

432
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:17,055
Oh, no.

433
00:22:17,056 --> 00:22:18,585
- What do we do? - My gosh.

434
00:22:18,586 --> 00:22:21,796
- My goodness. - I can't watch this.

435
00:22:22,457 --> 00:22:23,566
That was...

436
00:22:23,667 --> 00:22:25,626
(The videos of the same unit members are revealed now.)

437
00:22:25,627 --> 00:22:26,796
Oh, no.

438
00:22:28,266 --> 00:22:29,496
Oh, no.

439
00:22:34,477 --> 00:22:36,275
The contestant I pick...

440
00:22:36,276 --> 00:22:38,846
for possible elimination is...

441
00:22:43,177 --> 00:22:44,416
I pick...

442
00:22:44,417 --> 00:22:46,016
Yona.

443
00:22:51,026 --> 00:22:55,795
(Studying her face)

444
00:22:55,796 --> 00:22:57,427
It's Yona.

445
00:22:57,727 --> 00:23:01,536
She got to sing only one part.

446
00:23:01,566 --> 00:23:05,467
And I don't think...

447
00:23:05,607 --> 00:23:09,637
her dancing skills are good enough. So I picked her.

448
00:23:10,207 --> 00:23:12,745
I think it's Yona.

449
00:23:12,746 --> 00:23:13,917
Because...

450
00:23:13,947 --> 00:23:16,616
I remember that she didn't practice hard...

451
00:23:16,617 --> 00:23:20,387
even when her part was quite short.

452
00:23:23,157 --> 00:23:24,826
I pick Yona.

453
00:23:25,157 --> 00:23:28,157
The Unicorns weren't there to watch us practice,

454
00:23:28,296 --> 00:23:30,296
but we've seen each other practice.

455
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:34,836
I think Yona is the one who didn't work hard.

456
00:23:35,096 --> 00:23:37,407
So I picked her.

457
00:23:38,236 --> 00:23:40,476
I pick Yona.

458
00:23:40,477 --> 00:23:43,506
(The contestant picked by Unit "Dream Girl" is Yona.)

459
00:23:47,147 --> 00:23:50,986
(The reason the members of Unit "Dream Girl" picked Yona)

460
00:23:51,447 --> 00:23:56,186
(She kept using her phone during the practice.)

461
00:23:56,187 --> 00:23:57,326
Yona.

462
00:23:57,387 --> 00:23:59,285
When we were supposed to practice singing,

463
00:23:59,286 --> 00:24:02,096
she spent most of the time using her phone.

464
00:24:02,326 --> 00:24:04,127
She's older than me,

465
00:24:04,697 --> 00:24:08,167
so I couldn't tell her what to do.

466
00:24:08,937 --> 00:24:11,006
Should I stand there or here?

467
00:24:11,637 --> 00:24:13,366
Between Haram and Nana.

468
00:24:13,367 --> 00:24:15,287
(Yona didn't even remember the basic formation.)

469
00:24:15,377 --> 00:24:19,506
She ate snacks during the practice.

470
00:24:19,576 --> 00:24:24,846
So it made me think she wasn't paying attention.

471
00:24:27,457 --> 00:24:28,986
I was shocked.

472
00:24:29,756 --> 00:24:33,427
I didn't expect to get so many votes.

473
00:24:33,457 --> 00:24:36,726
I do think this it is unfair.

474
00:24:36,727 --> 00:24:38,427
(I do think this is unfair.)

475
00:24:41,566 --> 00:24:43,236
- Yona. - Yes.

476
00:24:43,397 --> 00:24:46,336
What's your determination for this performance?

477
00:24:46,437 --> 00:24:49,476
I will try my best...

478
00:24:49,477 --> 00:24:51,575
to prove that they made...

479
00:24:51,576 --> 00:24:54,046
a wrong choice.

480
00:24:56,346 --> 00:24:57,746
Good.

481
00:24:58,486 --> 00:24:59,947
I look forward to it.

482
00:25:00,046 --> 00:25:01,863
Unit "Dream Girl," please start your performance.

483
00:25:01,887 --> 00:25:03,255
- Yes. - Yes.

484
00:25:03,256 --> 00:25:04,555
- Thank you. - Thank you.

485
00:25:04,556 --> 00:25:06,326
- Good luck! - You can do this!

486
00:25:07,227 --> 00:25:08,596
Good luck.

487
00:25:08,957 --> 00:25:11,066
- We should watch them carefully. - Right.

488
00:25:11,467 --> 00:25:13,367
- Carefully. - Exactly.

489
00:25:13,766 --> 00:25:14,796
I hope they do well.

490
00:25:33,086 --> 00:25:35,255
("Dream Girl" by Gyoryeon, Nana, Bae Haram, Elisia, Oh Yoona, )

491
00:25:35,256 --> 00:25:37,296
(Yona, Yuri, Lim Seowon, Gehlee Dangca, and Kotoko)

492
00:25:41,657 --> 00:25:42,657
They're pretty.

493
00:27:04,677 --> 00:27:05,677
She's cute.

494
00:27:29,996 --> 00:27:31,167
This is so sad.

495
00:27:31,907 --> 00:27:34,076
- The lyrics. - I'm suddenly feeling sad.

496
00:28:20,986 --> 00:28:22,187
There you go!

497
00:28:27,957 --> 00:28:28,957
Well done.

498
00:28:29,427 --> 00:28:30,427
- They did well. - Right.

499
00:28:30,428 --> 00:28:32,348
- How would we pick one? - How would we do that?

500
00:28:32,566 --> 00:28:34,266
Who should we pick?

501
00:28:34,766 --> 00:28:37,437
- Thank you. - Thank you.

502
00:28:38,066 --> 00:28:39,107
This is hard.

503
00:28:46,746 --> 00:28:48,815
I think it's hard to pull off a new song.

504
00:28:48,816 --> 00:28:49,816
I mean...

505
00:28:50,447 --> 00:28:52,815
Making your debut with a new song...

506
00:28:52,816 --> 00:28:55,187
and finding your own color.

507
00:28:55,417 --> 00:28:59,887
I can't help feeling that you need to work harder to achieve all that.

508
00:29:00,596 --> 00:29:05,367
When I watch a group with a lot of members perform,

509
00:29:05,766 --> 00:29:10,296
I can't help but pay more attention to the ones...

510
00:29:10,397 --> 00:29:13,167
that sing more parts.

511
00:29:13,907 --> 00:29:16,207
To be honest, that's why...

512
00:29:17,776 --> 00:29:19,977
I found your performance a little disappointing, Yona.

513
00:29:20,377 --> 00:29:23,316
I was waiting for your part.

514
00:29:23,516 --> 00:29:27,217
But I don't think you pulled it off perfectly.

515
00:29:27,457 --> 00:29:29,617
So I found it disappointing.

516
00:29:31,657 --> 00:29:34,996
And I'd like to say something good about Nana.

517
00:29:35,596 --> 00:29:37,426
Whatever part you're given,

518
00:29:37,427 --> 00:29:39,367
you just pull it off perfectly.

519
00:29:39,697 --> 00:29:41,036
- She works hard. - Thank you.

520
00:29:41,266 --> 00:29:43,436
You had to rap this time.

521
00:29:43,437 --> 00:29:46,607
Your delivery was perfect and so were your facial expressions.

522
00:29:47,137 --> 00:29:52,546
This song sounds energetic and overwhelming,

523
00:29:52,647 --> 00:29:54,845
but the lyrics are actually...

524
00:29:54,846 --> 00:29:56,745
emotional and heartbreaking.

525
00:29:56,746 --> 00:29:59,485
But you did a great job...

526
00:29:59,486 --> 00:30:01,916
pulling off all that.

527
00:30:01,917 --> 00:30:03,316
Nana and Yoona.

528
00:30:04,127 --> 00:30:05,525
- Thank you. - Thank you.

529
00:30:05,526 --> 00:30:06,556
Thank you.

530
00:30:11,296 --> 00:30:13,596
The Unicorns, the producers, and the contestants...

531
00:30:14,167 --> 00:30:16,436
will now vote out one contestant to be eliminated.

532
00:30:16,437 --> 00:30:18,206
- What do we do? What about us? - What do we do?

533
00:30:18,207 --> 00:30:20,236
I'm not ready for this.

534
00:30:21,677 --> 00:30:24,076
Please wait backstage a little.

535
00:30:24,506 --> 00:30:27,207
- Yes. Thank you. - Thank you.

536
00:30:28,477 --> 00:30:29,977
You did well.

537
00:30:33,647 --> 00:30:36,187
- Oh, dear. - Who should we pick?

538
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:39,056
This is really hard.

539
00:30:39,756 --> 00:30:42,526
A song like this is really difficult.

540
00:30:42,897 --> 00:30:43,926
I know.

541
00:30:43,927 --> 00:30:44,966
You're right.

542
00:30:44,967 --> 00:30:46,967
It's hard even for professional singers.

543
00:30:47,836 --> 00:30:48,867
Exactly.

544
00:30:49,566 --> 00:30:51,467
Who do you have in mind?

545
00:30:52,167 --> 00:30:53,836
- For me, Yona. - Yona.

546
00:30:54,536 --> 00:30:57,707
Don't you think they will pick Yona?

547
00:30:58,407 --> 00:31:00,345
The producers or the contestants.

548
00:31:00,346 --> 00:31:01,586
That's what we should consider.

549
00:31:01,746 --> 00:31:02,916
I think the contestants and producers will pick her.

550
00:31:02,917 --> 00:31:04,045
- Both will pick her. - Right.

551
00:31:04,046 --> 00:31:05,686
I think she'll be chosen by both of them.

552
00:31:07,687 --> 00:31:09,985
I bet they also have these two in mind.

553
00:31:09,986 --> 00:31:10,986
Right.

554
00:31:11,486 --> 00:31:12,586
To be honest,

555
00:31:13,056 --> 00:31:14,495
I think she also had...

556
00:31:14,496 --> 00:31:15,926
- little presence. - You're right.

557
00:31:15,927 --> 00:31:16,996
I agree.

558
00:31:17,826 --> 00:31:20,367
She could've been a good fit for the song.

559
00:31:21,167 --> 00:31:22,966
- But she was a little... - It's also bad...

560
00:31:22,967 --> 00:31:25,906
that she didn't stand out even though she sang many parts.

561
00:31:25,907 --> 00:31:26,907
Right.

562
00:31:26,908 --> 00:31:29,305
- She was the least impressive. - Right.

563
00:31:29,306 --> 00:31:30,335
Yes.

564
00:31:30,336 --> 00:31:32,947
I wonder how it will go.

565
00:31:39,846 --> 00:31:45,157
(It's time to vote out a contestant from the opposing unit.)

566
00:31:45,927 --> 00:31:48,957
Gosh, what do I do?

567
00:32:00,236 --> 00:32:04,107
Actually, I thought she did well during the interim evaluation.

568
00:32:04,407 --> 00:32:06,947
But after watching today's performance...

569
00:32:07,207 --> 00:32:12,687
I didn't find her performance so memorable today.

570
00:32:13,246 --> 00:32:19,326
(It's not easy to pick a contestant for possible elimination.)

571
00:32:27,397 --> 00:32:33,506
(Unit "Yummy Yum" is done casting their votes.)

572
00:32:34,977 --> 00:32:36,505
(The contestants picked by the Unicorns, producers, )

573
00:32:36,506 --> 00:32:37,906
(and contestants are revealed now.)

574
00:32:37,907 --> 00:32:41,246
Unit "Dream Girl," please come up to the stage.

575
00:32:48,086 --> 00:32:49,117
My gosh.

576
00:32:52,526 --> 00:32:53,727
They must be really nervous.

577
00:32:54,457 --> 00:32:55,496
Oh, no.

578
00:32:59,766 --> 00:33:03,437
We will reveal the contestants for possible elimination...

579
00:33:03,796 --> 00:33:06,637
chosen by the Unicorns, the producers, and the contestants.

580
00:33:15,477 --> 00:33:16,846
I'm feeling more nervous.

581
00:33:19,217 --> 00:33:21,016
I just can't do this.

582
00:33:24,756 --> 00:33:26,156
(The contestants for possible elimination are revealed.)

583
00:33:26,157 --> 00:33:27,255
- This is how it goes. - My goodness.

584
00:33:27,256 --> 00:33:29,995
(Possible Elimination Members for Unit Station)

585
00:33:29,996 --> 00:33:31,476
- This is how it goes. - My goodness.

586
00:33:32,796 --> 00:33:33,796
This is crazy.

587
00:33:33,797 --> 00:33:35,437
Oh, no. Seriously...

588
00:33:37,167 --> 00:33:38,167
- Unicorns? - What?

589
00:33:40,167 --> 00:33:41,177
Unicorns?

590
00:33:41,836 --> 00:33:44,177
Is it the choice of the Unicorns?

591
00:33:44,907 --> 00:33:47,576
(Possible Elimination Members for Unit Station)

592
00:33:47,947 --> 00:33:49,045
This is so cruel.

593
00:33:49,046 --> 00:33:51,886
(Who is the contestant chosen by the Unicorns?)

594
00:33:51,887 --> 00:33:55,285
(Possible Elimination Members for Unit Station)

595
00:33:55,286 --> 00:33:59,356
(The contestant chosen by the Unicorns is Yona.)

596
00:33:59,357 --> 00:34:00,427
Oh, no.

597
00:34:02,357 --> 00:34:03,517
- Yona. - What should she do?

598
00:34:05,196 --> 00:34:06,226
Gosh, it's on.

599
00:34:06,227 --> 00:34:10,536
(Who is the contestant chosen by the producers?)

600
00:34:17,576 --> 00:34:18,576
Seriously?

601
00:34:20,777 --> 00:34:22,115
(Contestants, Unicorns, Producers)

602
00:34:22,116 --> 00:34:27,556
(The contestant chosen by the producers is Yuri.)

603
00:34:27,786 --> 00:34:29,516
So it's Yuri.

604
00:34:32,187 --> 00:34:35,457
I thought Yuri would be a perfect fit for the song.

605
00:34:35,826 --> 00:34:39,326
Despite all that, she didn't stand out much.

606
00:34:40,027 --> 00:34:41,535
I didn't see this coming.

607
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:43,237
(Yona and Yuri got one vote each.)

608
00:34:44,237 --> 00:34:45,336
Why am I feeling more nervous?

609
00:34:45,337 --> 00:34:46,683
(Now the only thing that's left is the contestants' choice.)

610
00:34:46,707 --> 00:34:49,236
They might have to perform solo if it ended like this.

611
00:34:49,237 --> 00:34:50,237
Right.

612
00:34:51,147 --> 00:34:55,916
(If one of them gets 2 votes, they get eliminated immediately.)

613
00:34:55,917 --> 00:35:00,746
(If it's a tie, they will perform solo for a rematch.)

614
00:35:00,987 --> 00:35:02,856
(Who is the contestant chosen by Unit "Yummy Yum?")

615
00:35:02,857 --> 00:35:05,186
(Contestants, Unicorns, Producers)

616
00:35:05,187 --> 00:35:10,257
(The opposing unit selected Yona as the eliminated candidate.)

617
00:35:11,696 --> 00:35:12,765
Oh, no.

618
00:35:12,766 --> 00:35:15,196
(With 2 votes, Yona is eliminated.)

619
00:35:17,966 --> 00:35:20,167
The member eliminated from Unit "Dream Girl..."

620
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:22,207
is Yona.

621
00:35:23,007 --> 00:35:24,647
Great work until now.

622
00:35:25,207 --> 00:35:26,306
Good job.

623
00:35:29,477 --> 00:35:30,716
You've worked hard.

624
00:35:31,647 --> 00:35:33,116
Great work, Yona.

625
00:35:34,587 --> 00:35:38,757
Thank you so much to everyone.

626
00:35:39,257 --> 00:35:43,425
I promise to show...

627
00:35:43,426 --> 00:35:48,166
how much I've improved in the future.

628
00:35:48,167 --> 00:35:49,996
Please look forward to it.

629
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:53,906
I'm heartbroken.

630
00:35:56,136 --> 00:35:57,876
(Yona from Unit "Dream Girl" is eliminated.)

631
00:35:57,877 --> 00:36:01,175
Unit "Dream Girl" can leave the stage now.

632
00:36:01,176 --> 00:36:02,346
Great work.

633
00:36:02,547 --> 00:36:04,547
- Thank you. - Thank you.

634
00:36:06,417 --> 00:36:08,957
- Good job, everyone. - Good job.

635
00:36:09,116 --> 00:36:10,187
You worked hard.

636
00:36:10,886 --> 00:36:11,886
Yona.

637
00:36:12,727 --> 00:36:14,156
You really did well.

638
00:36:14,257 --> 00:36:15,456
Why do you look happy?

639
00:36:15,457 --> 00:36:17,356
What's with the tears?

640
00:36:17,357 --> 00:36:19,666
- Why are you crying? - Why are you happy?

641
00:36:19,667 --> 00:36:23,636
No, I'm not happy.

642
00:36:23,897 --> 00:36:25,166
It's okay.

643
00:36:25,167 --> 00:36:26,566
(She accepts the result with a smile.)

644
00:36:26,567 --> 00:36:29,437
Universe Ticket...

645
00:36:30,977 --> 00:36:34,277
was a big part of my life.

646
00:36:34,716 --> 00:36:37,147
I only have good memories of this show.

647
00:36:39,216 --> 00:36:42,056
Unit "Yummy Yum," come up to the stage.

648
00:36:43,087 --> 00:36:44,786
- Hi. - Hi.

649
00:36:45,487 --> 00:36:47,526
- Hi. - Hi.

650
00:36:47,527 --> 00:36:49,627
- This unit has a different concept. - Hi.

651
00:36:52,797 --> 00:36:56,366
(Girl crush is the concept of Unit "Yummy Yum.")

652
00:36:58,366 --> 00:36:59,567
They look cool.

653
00:37:00,266 --> 00:37:02,937
Unit "Yummy Yum," introduce your team.

654
00:37:03,536 --> 00:37:04,606
Two, three.

655
00:37:04,607 --> 00:37:08,047
- Yummy, down in one gulp - Yummy, down in one gulp

656
00:37:08,246 --> 00:37:09,316
- Hi. - Hi.

657
00:37:09,317 --> 00:37:12,547
- We're Unit "Yummy Yum." - We're Unit "Yummy Yum."

658
00:37:14,457 --> 00:37:15,587
That was adorable.

659
00:37:18,357 --> 00:37:22,126
Tell us what kind of a song "Yummy Yum" is.

660
00:37:22,127 --> 00:37:25,195
Sure. "Yummy Yum" is a song...

661
00:37:25,196 --> 00:37:27,937
with the same meaning as "Dream Girl."

662
00:37:28,196 --> 00:37:30,666
It's a song about girls who ambitiously break...

663
00:37:30,667 --> 00:37:34,576
into the world to make their dreams come true.

664
00:37:34,737 --> 00:37:36,476
But what's different is that...

665
00:37:36,477 --> 00:37:38,676
"Yummy Yum" has this strong will to rise,

666
00:37:38,906 --> 00:37:41,816
even by stepping on others,

667
00:37:41,817 --> 00:37:44,987
and gives off the vibe that I'm the best.

668
00:37:45,216 --> 00:37:47,687
That has been portrayed cutely through the lyrics,

669
00:37:47,746 --> 00:37:51,286
"Yummy yum, I will gulp you down in one bite."

670
00:37:53,727 --> 00:37:56,296
All right. We should listen to the song, right?

671
00:37:56,297 --> 00:37:57,426
- Yes. - Yes.

672
00:37:57,596 --> 00:37:58,627
- Let's go! - Let's go!

673
00:38:05,266 --> 00:38:09,777
(Contrary to the cute title, the beat is powerful.)

674
00:38:10,607 --> 00:38:13,607
It was a very cool song.

675
00:38:13,707 --> 00:38:16,176
The song was right up my street.

676
00:38:16,277 --> 00:38:20,016
I thought how great it would've been if it was my debut song.

677
00:38:20,516 --> 00:38:22,616
(Yummy, down in one gulp)

678
00:38:22,757 --> 00:38:25,127
(Yummy)

679
00:38:25,587 --> 00:38:26,785
I'm getting hooked.

680
00:38:26,786 --> 00:38:28,026
- "Yummy." - I'm already hooked.

681
00:38:28,027 --> 00:38:29,596
Yummy

682
00:38:30,556 --> 00:38:32,825
("Yummy Yum" is fierce and addicting.)

683
00:38:32,826 --> 00:38:34,566
That was great. I love it.

684
00:38:34,567 --> 00:38:37,636
As a hip-hop song, there will be many rap parts.

685
00:38:39,136 --> 00:38:41,437
- Nice. - Should I start rapping?

686
00:38:42,036 --> 00:38:44,905
(The day of dividing the parts)

687
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:46,377
- Hi. - Hi.

688
00:38:46,576 --> 00:38:49,547
- Hi. - They're the rap members.

689
00:38:49,917 --> 00:38:51,046
Did you practice?

690
00:38:51,047 --> 00:38:52,216
- Yes. - Yes.

691
00:38:52,786 --> 00:38:55,086
We'll listen to the rap parts...

692
00:38:55,087 --> 00:38:57,417
and decide who gets what.

693
00:38:57,786 --> 00:38:59,456
Just rap as you always have.

694
00:38:59,457 --> 00:39:00,457
- Okay. - Okay.

695
00:39:00,458 --> 00:39:01,695
You only have one chance.

696
00:39:01,696 --> 00:39:03,496
(A new product has come for the rap part.)

697
00:39:03,696 --> 00:39:05,325
(The main rapper of girl group FIESTAR)

698
00:39:05,326 --> 00:39:06,572
(Sallied forth as a solo artist)

699
00:39:06,596 --> 00:39:09,996
(She's the next-generation girl group rapper, Yezi.)

700
00:39:13,266 --> 00:39:16,007
(The 1st main rapper candidate, Gabi)

701
00:39:27,446 --> 00:39:30,086
- She's kind of singing. - It feels like a singing rap.

702
00:39:30,087 --> 00:39:32,527
- The song is great. - Something like this.

703
00:39:32,857 --> 00:39:34,857
(The 2nd main rapper candidate, Lee Sunwoo)

704
00:39:42,536 --> 00:39:44,536
- Okay. - She's good.

705
00:39:45,607 --> 00:39:47,306
- That was nice. - Thank you.

706
00:39:47,906 --> 00:39:50,107
(The 3rd main rapper candidate, Kim Sumin)

707
00:39:57,377 --> 00:39:58,885
- Okay. - Okay.

708
00:39:58,886 --> 00:40:01,187
- Okay. - Good job.

709
00:40:02,257 --> 00:40:05,086
- Gabi, Sunwoo. - Gabi rapped...

710
00:40:05,087 --> 00:40:07,457
as if she was singing.

711
00:40:07,627 --> 00:40:11,496
So it would be better to give her a melody rap part.

712
00:40:11,696 --> 00:40:14,526
Then, we should think about Gabi's part more...

713
00:40:14,527 --> 00:40:16,696
- as we work on the song. - Yes.

714
00:40:17,036 --> 00:40:19,206
The conclusion we came up with was that...

715
00:40:19,207 --> 00:40:21,576
Sumin would sing the first part,

716
00:40:22,036 --> 00:40:25,206
and then Sunwoo would sing the later part.

717
00:40:25,207 --> 00:40:26,906
- That was what we decided. - Okay.

718
00:40:26,977 --> 00:40:28,046
All set.

719
00:40:28,047 --> 00:40:30,046
(Gabi's part hasn't been decided yet.)

720
00:40:30,047 --> 00:40:34,856
I was very upset because it was a part I wanted.

721
00:40:34,857 --> 00:40:36,486
I was thrilled.

722
00:40:36,487 --> 00:40:39,987
It made me think I should work harder.

723
00:40:41,826 --> 00:40:45,527
(After deciding on the rap part, it's a special class with Yezi.)

724
00:40:45,926 --> 00:40:48,396
Chew it, just like a bubble gum

725
00:40:48,397 --> 00:40:50,566
- That bubble gum is so easy for me - Sing louder.

726
00:40:50,567 --> 00:40:52,936
DNA, you're a subject of study

727
00:40:52,937 --> 00:40:55,076
Guys, are you practicing your facial expressions?

728
00:40:55,477 --> 00:40:57,175
- Practice as if you're on stage. - Okay.

729
00:40:57,176 --> 00:40:58,706
- You look too kind, Sumin. - Okay.

730
00:40:58,707 --> 00:41:00,675
Sujin should also walk out more fiercely.

731
00:41:00,676 --> 00:41:01,745
Got it.

732
00:41:01,746 --> 00:41:03,675
Don't dance like this.

733
00:41:03,676 --> 00:41:04,686
Okay.

734
00:41:04,687 --> 00:41:06,846
(Unit "Yummy Yum" is too kind and not spiteful.)

735
00:41:07,116 --> 00:41:09,055
That is too cute. Do it again.

736
00:41:09,056 --> 00:41:10,716
- Again, Jinyeong. - Okay.

737
00:41:12,727 --> 00:41:17,296
(Will they be able to transform into bad girls?)

738
00:41:17,297 --> 00:41:18,297
Okay!

739
00:41:18,527 --> 00:41:20,365
(A special measure for Unit "Yummy Yum")

740
00:41:20,366 --> 00:41:22,166
- Hi. - Hi.

741
00:41:22,167 --> 00:41:23,696
I should greet you more formally.

742
00:41:24,096 --> 00:41:27,607
I'm a vocal director as well as a trainer.

743
00:41:27,667 --> 00:41:31,506
It's nice to meet you all today.

744
00:41:31,507 --> 00:41:33,905
- Thank you. - Nice to meet you.

745
00:41:33,906 --> 00:41:35,623
- Nice to meet you too. - Nice to meet you too.

746
00:41:35,647 --> 00:41:38,987
I'd like to listen to the whole song first.

747
00:41:39,087 --> 00:41:41,016
Down on your knees

748
00:41:41,687 --> 00:41:43,115
Get on your knees

749
00:41:43,116 --> 00:41:44,886
Stop for a moment.

750
00:41:45,027 --> 00:41:48,195
You should sound sexier, more laidback,

751
00:41:48,196 --> 00:41:51,095
rougher, more arrogant, more bad,

752
00:41:51,096 --> 00:41:53,326
and such.

753
00:41:53,466 --> 00:41:56,996
"I'm too upright," is what you give off.

754
00:41:57,167 --> 00:42:01,135
It's a song very far from the vibe...

755
00:42:01,136 --> 00:42:02,776
of an upright and honest student.

756
00:42:02,777 --> 00:42:05,107
Sing as if...

757
00:42:05,306 --> 00:42:07,245
you're acting.

758
00:42:07,246 --> 00:42:10,576
(Singing while acting out the lyrics)

759
00:42:10,746 --> 00:42:12,087
Okay.

760
00:42:12,187 --> 00:42:14,586
I don't stop like Rambo

761
00:42:14,587 --> 00:42:17,016
I don't need any expensive things

762
00:42:17,116 --> 00:42:20,226
Okay. You sound much better than before now that you've relaxed.

763
00:42:20,227 --> 00:42:22,857
Get into the habit of practicing...

764
00:42:22,926 --> 00:42:24,896
after studying...

765
00:42:24,897 --> 00:42:27,465
- how your charm can stand out more. - Okay.

766
00:42:27,466 --> 00:42:30,766
- Great work. - Thank you.

767
00:42:32,937 --> 00:42:35,305
(The day of the interim evaluation)

768
00:42:35,306 --> 00:42:37,536
- Good luck! - Good luck!

769
00:42:40,806 --> 00:42:42,015
What kind of a song can it be?

770
00:42:42,016 --> 00:42:43,446
I'm curious.

771
00:42:51,757 --> 00:42:55,696
(They have turned into baddies.)

772
00:43:00,766 --> 00:43:01,996
How cool.

773
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:12,346
What was that just now?

774
00:43:16,346 --> 00:43:18,015
(Their performance shocked everyone.)

775
00:43:18,016 --> 00:43:19,285
They were amazing.

776
00:43:19,286 --> 00:43:20,615
That unit killed it.

777
00:43:20,616 --> 00:43:22,216
- I'm shocked. - I liked it.

778
00:43:23,016 --> 00:43:24,186
All of them were cool.

779
00:43:24,187 --> 00:43:25,385
(They're back to being nice girls.)

780
00:43:25,386 --> 00:43:27,756
- Thank you. - Thank you.

781
00:43:27,757 --> 00:43:29,556
I don't think anyone will get eliminated.

782
00:43:30,027 --> 00:43:32,567
(Time to pick the potential candidate for elimination)

783
00:43:33,067 --> 00:43:37,866
(The opposing unit votes first.)

784
00:43:43,636 --> 00:43:46,047
I have no idea.

785
00:43:47,576 --> 00:43:48,817
What now?

786
00:43:49,616 --> 00:43:51,917
I can't decide.

787
00:43:53,616 --> 00:43:57,115
Everyone was great, so I wasn't sure who to choose.

788
00:43:57,116 --> 00:44:00,487
(Despite choosing the potential candidate, it's not easy.)

789
00:44:01,457 --> 00:44:06,527
(Unit "Yummy Yum" starts to vote.)

790
00:44:11,036 --> 00:44:13,135
(Who will the members of the same unit...)

791
00:44:13,136 --> 00:44:15,206
(they have practiced with choose?)

792
00:44:15,207 --> 00:44:16,377
I choose...

793
00:44:17,337 --> 00:44:18,507
I choose...

794
00:44:18,946 --> 00:44:21,546
- I chose... - The member I think...

795
00:44:21,547 --> 00:44:23,877
The member I think will get eliminated is...

796
00:44:25,616 --> 00:44:27,916
I made up my mind.

797
00:44:27,917 --> 00:44:31,687
(What is the result of the votes?)

798
00:44:32,627 --> 00:44:34,786
Please, not me.

799
00:44:34,957 --> 00:44:36,957
I hope it's not me.

800
00:44:37,727 --> 00:44:39,397
What if it's me?

801
00:44:42,067 --> 00:44:43,136
Please.

802
00:44:45,036 --> 00:44:47,666
The potential member from Unit "Yummy Yum..."

803
00:44:47,667 --> 00:44:50,306
who I think will get eliminated is...

804
00:44:54,977 --> 00:44:57,277
Who I think will get eliminated is...

805
00:44:58,116 --> 00:44:59,616
Eunhyung.

806
00:45:00,987 --> 00:45:02,457
Eunhyung.

807
00:45:03,817 --> 00:45:05,056
Here's why.

808
00:45:05,087 --> 00:45:07,356
When she performed today, she looked...

809
00:45:07,357 --> 00:45:09,627
a bit awkward.

810
00:45:10,227 --> 00:45:12,266
So I picked her.

811
00:45:14,027 --> 00:45:18,437
The one I picked is...

812
00:45:19,806 --> 00:45:21,437
Eunhyung.

813
00:45:22,107 --> 00:45:24,437
Her team is really strong.

814
00:45:24,737 --> 00:45:31,246
So compared to her teammates, she seemed a bit unstable.

815
00:45:31,647 --> 00:45:35,286
Eunhyung is really pretty. And she did well too.

816
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:39,087
But she didn't stand out as much on this team.

817
00:45:39,687 --> 00:45:41,286
A lot of them must have picked me.

818
00:45:41,727 --> 00:45:44,996
I chose Kwon Eunhyung.

819
00:45:45,797 --> 00:45:47,425
It's Eunhyung.

820
00:45:47,426 --> 00:45:50,026
(Eunhyung got the most votes as the likely one to be eliminated.)

821
00:45:52,607 --> 00:45:53,766
That's just feedback.

822
00:45:57,477 --> 00:45:58,877
I can do better for the real thing.

823
00:46:00,676 --> 00:46:02,946
To be honest, I could feel that I wasn't good this time.

824
00:46:04,547 --> 00:46:06,987
Honestly speaking, I was insecure...

825
00:46:07,417 --> 00:46:11,116
because I wasn't confident I could pull off my part.

826
00:46:11,257 --> 00:46:12,656
Ice on my wrist

827
00:46:13,556 --> 00:46:14,925
Ice on my wrist

828
00:46:14,926 --> 00:46:17,155
(The lack of confidence showed during the performance.)

829
00:46:17,156 --> 00:46:19,067
- Gosh, Eunhyung. Oh, no. - She's cute.

830
00:46:19,426 --> 00:46:20,567
She's cute.

831
00:46:21,397 --> 00:46:22,966
As for Eunhyung,

832
00:46:23,096 --> 00:46:27,406
she got the part toward the end of the chorus which could stand out.

833
00:46:27,437 --> 00:46:30,106
As long as she feels confident about it,

834
00:46:30,107 --> 00:46:31,587
it will be the highlight of the song.

835
00:46:34,977 --> 00:46:37,945
The contestant I think might get eliminated is...

836
00:46:37,946 --> 00:46:42,056
(The members of the same unit picked a member who may be eliminated.)

837
00:46:44,817 --> 00:46:46,487
It's Gabi.

838
00:46:47,087 --> 00:46:48,757
It's Gabi.

839
00:46:52,996 --> 00:46:54,526
It's because...

840
00:46:54,527 --> 00:46:59,737
when we practiced, she had the hardest time focusing.

841
00:47:00,636 --> 00:47:01,936
I think...

842
00:47:01,937 --> 00:47:04,136
it might be Gabi.

843
00:47:04,237 --> 00:47:08,516
During the practice, she was goofing around.

844
00:47:08,547 --> 00:47:10,417
I noticed some behaviors like that.

845
00:47:10,446 --> 00:47:18,116
When we practiced, Gabi had a hard time staying focused.

846
00:47:18,587 --> 00:47:21,326
When I thought about our practice sessions,

847
00:47:21,757 --> 00:47:23,856
she struggled to keep up with the team...

848
00:47:23,857 --> 00:47:26,027
even after going over what to do in detail.

849
00:47:26,096 --> 00:47:29,136
If she can't fix them for the real performance,

850
00:47:29,196 --> 00:47:31,496
she might stand out in a negative way.

851
00:47:32,866 --> 00:47:35,536
We've been practicing together all this time.

852
00:47:36,707 --> 00:47:40,406
I was quite upset that they picked me.

853
00:47:41,306 --> 00:47:43,046
(The practice session of Unit "Yummy Yum")

854
00:47:43,047 --> 00:47:45,287
Gabi. We're starting from the top. Hurry up and join us.

855
00:47:47,116 --> 00:47:50,116
(Even when her teammates urge Gabi to join, Gabi goofs around.)

856
00:47:50,187 --> 00:47:51,987
Let her keep doing that.

857
00:47:52,587 --> 00:47:55,397
Ice on my wrist

858
00:47:55,496 --> 00:47:58,096
Step, push. And push again. Then the hands.

859
00:47:59,027 --> 00:48:00,526
When I observed Gabi,

860
00:48:00,527 --> 00:48:03,365
I wasn't sure why. I wondered if she had a problem.

861
00:48:03,366 --> 00:48:05,606
I was wondering if she was behaving like that...

862
00:48:05,607 --> 00:48:07,837
because of a problem we weren't aware of.

863
00:48:09,107 --> 00:48:11,805
As we continued to practice,

864
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:14,277
she's struggling to stay focused.

865
00:48:15,846 --> 00:48:17,277
Gabi. Let's do it right.

866
00:48:20,487 --> 00:48:22,587
- Is that your 100 percent? - Yes.

867
00:48:23,016 --> 00:48:24,087
I don't think so.

868
00:48:28,127 --> 00:48:30,957
I knew about her behavior when we prepared for "Girls On Top."

869
00:48:31,027 --> 00:48:34,297
When Gabi can't get the part she wants,

870
00:48:34,366 --> 00:48:37,566
she goes through some kind of slump. Should I call it that?

871
00:48:37,567 --> 00:48:38,706
That hits her pretty hard.

872
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:41,365
She tried out to be the main rapper for this song.

873
00:48:41,366 --> 00:48:43,906
But she got a different part.

874
00:48:44,136 --> 00:48:46,305
(Gabi can't seem to focus after getting her part.)

875
00:48:46,306 --> 00:48:48,946
Considering everything we've done so far,

876
00:48:49,016 --> 00:48:52,746
I think Gabi is the closest one to getting eliminated.

877
00:48:53,187 --> 00:48:55,817
I feel really bad for saying this.

878
00:48:57,056 --> 00:48:59,156
I think she should join a different team.

879
00:48:59,926 --> 00:49:03,556
It made me wonder if I goofed around too much.

880
00:49:06,227 --> 00:49:09,495
If the opposing team chose me,

881
00:49:09,496 --> 00:49:12,106
it probably meant I wasn't good enough.

882
00:49:12,107 --> 00:49:15,736
I would be more upset if the opposing team chose me.

883
00:49:15,737 --> 00:49:17,652
(I would be more upset if the opposing team chose me.)

884
00:49:17,676 --> 00:49:19,046
This applies to all parts.

885
00:49:19,047 --> 00:49:21,246
There should be an accent in all of your parts.

886
00:49:21,676 --> 00:49:23,016
You need to show your power.

887
00:49:23,576 --> 00:49:25,015
- This part. - Yes.

888
00:49:25,016 --> 00:49:26,587
I can't nail the vibe for this part.

889
00:49:26,786 --> 00:49:27,946
One. Yes.

890
00:49:28,047 --> 00:49:29,817
Push your body forward more.

891
00:49:29,886 --> 00:49:31,687
Move it forward. Like you're bouncing.

892
00:49:31,987 --> 00:49:34,757
Yes. Like that. Bounce it.

893
00:49:34,786 --> 00:49:35,857
Bounce it.

894
00:49:35,926 --> 00:49:39,127
Actually, my part can grab a lot of attention.

895
00:49:39,227 --> 00:49:42,337
If I practice my gestures a lot for my part,

896
00:49:42,797 --> 00:49:46,067
I might stand out. So I'm trying my best.

897
00:49:46,167 --> 00:49:48,436
I don't think the results will remain the same.

898
00:49:48,437 --> 00:49:49,683
(I don't think the results will remain the same.)

899
00:49:49,707 --> 00:49:50,777
Ta-da.

900
00:49:50,837 --> 00:49:52,175
- Great. - Was it good?

901
00:49:52,176 --> 00:49:53,777
- You improved a lot. - That's a relief.

902
00:49:53,846 --> 00:49:55,946
- The last one. - What a relief.

903
00:49:56,277 --> 00:49:57,416
Let's change it up.

904
00:49:57,417 --> 00:49:59,285
Can Eunhyung and Gabi come to the middle?

905
00:49:59,286 --> 00:50:00,316
- Okay. - Okay.

906
00:50:00,317 --> 00:50:02,515
I'm sorry. Can you guys stand behind them?

907
00:50:02,516 --> 00:50:03,516
All right. And...

908
00:50:03,517 --> 00:50:05,987
Step, push. Ice on my wrist

909
00:50:07,156 --> 00:50:08,727
Down on your knees

910
00:50:09,056 --> 00:50:14,366
(Who will be eliminated from Unit "Yummy Yum?")

911
00:50:14,627 --> 00:50:15,796
All right.

912
00:50:15,797 --> 00:50:18,336
We're now ready for Unit "Yummy Yum."

913
00:50:18,337 --> 00:50:19,337
- Okay. - Okay.

914
00:50:19,338 --> 00:50:21,506
- Thank you. - Thank you.

915
00:50:21,507 --> 00:50:22,675
- Good luck. - I'm so nervous.

916
00:50:22,676 --> 00:50:24,936
- Gosh. I can't wait. - Seriously. I can't wait.

917
00:50:24,937 --> 00:50:27,257
- I'm so excited for this. - I'm getting excited for this.

918
00:50:28,007 --> 00:50:30,527
(Even the opposing unit can't wait to watch their performance.)

919
00:50:34,716 --> 00:50:35,817
Please.

920
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:38,116
Please do well.

921
00:50:51,036 --> 00:50:53,035
("Yummy Yum" by Gabi, Kwon Eunhyung, )

922
00:50:53,036 --> 00:50:55,376
(Kim Sumin, Kim Sujin, Narumi, Nizi, Bang Yunha, Bae Yeram, Lee Sunwoo, )

923
00:50:55,377 --> 00:50:57,607
(Lee Huran, Jeon Jinyeong, Jayla, Jin Hyeonju)

924
00:51:26,906 --> 00:51:28,337
Oh, my gosh.

925
00:51:43,116 --> 00:51:44,556
This is crazy.

926
00:52:02,977 --> 00:52:04,507
She's really good.

927
00:52:55,156 --> 00:52:56,957
She's good!

928
00:53:21,587 --> 00:53:22,917
Let's go!

929
00:53:35,366 --> 00:53:36,636
This is insane.

930
00:53:40,366 --> 00:53:42,937
- Yes. - Hey.

931
00:53:58,987 --> 00:54:00,556
Gosh, she's good.

932
00:54:18,076 --> 00:54:20,547
(Cheering for the performance)

933
00:54:23,576 --> 00:54:25,076
(Amazed)

934
00:54:25,116 --> 00:54:27,087
You killed it.

935
00:54:28,917 --> 00:54:31,215
- That was good energy. - Well done.

936
00:54:31,216 --> 00:54:33,926
- Thank you. - Thank you.

937
00:54:34,786 --> 00:54:36,196
- Gosh. - You were incredible!

938
00:54:37,496 --> 00:54:41,996
(The sense of excitement lingers on.)

939
00:54:43,996 --> 00:54:46,837
I threw my paper into the air.

940
00:54:47,966 --> 00:54:50,076
I think I expressed myself to the fullest.

941
00:54:51,107 --> 00:54:54,277
Seriously. I want to throw my shoes if I can.

942
00:54:54,547 --> 00:54:55,917
You guys were amazing.

943
00:54:56,277 --> 00:55:00,246
- Thank you. - Thank you.

944
00:55:00,346 --> 00:55:02,047
By the way,

945
00:55:02,457 --> 00:55:04,555
I want to compliment Gabi.

946
00:55:04,556 --> 00:55:07,886
You didn't have a lot of parts like before.

947
00:55:07,957 --> 00:55:11,026
I could tell that you worked really hard to make the part yours.

948
00:55:11,027 --> 00:55:16,266
I got the feeling that this song suited your image well.

949
00:55:16,696 --> 00:55:18,796
- Yes. - You let that shine today.

950
00:55:18,797 --> 00:55:22,176
Personally, it left a strong impression on me.

951
00:55:22,607 --> 00:55:23,937
- Thank you. - Sure.

952
00:55:27,147 --> 00:55:28,176
Personally,

953
00:55:29,016 --> 00:55:33,386
I got to rediscover a new side of Sumin today.

954
00:55:33,716 --> 00:55:37,655
It was impossible not to pay attention to you.

955
00:55:37,656 --> 00:55:38,756
Sumin killed it.

956
00:55:38,757 --> 00:55:40,687
Yes. Your parts...

957
00:55:42,087 --> 00:55:46,026
During your first part, I screamed.

958
00:55:46,027 --> 00:55:47,166
Gosh.

959
00:55:47,167 --> 00:55:49,897
Seriously. You were so solid. You looked beautiful too.

960
00:55:51,167 --> 00:55:57,237
(Sumin left an impression with her solid rap.)

961
00:56:01,906 --> 00:56:04,877
And this feedback is for you, Yunha.

962
00:56:05,176 --> 00:56:08,785
You always do such a good job at nailing the concept of the song.

963
00:56:08,786 --> 00:56:11,216
Your understanding of songs in general is very high.

964
00:56:11,857 --> 00:56:15,425
Each song has this unique part that gives the color of the song.

965
00:56:15,426 --> 00:56:18,695
She's the one who executes those parts the best.

966
00:56:18,696 --> 00:56:19,797
- Thank you. - Today too.

967
00:56:20,127 --> 00:56:22,365
The lyrics went, "You can't take it even if you were spoon-fed, stupid."

968
00:56:22,366 --> 00:56:23,686
When you were whispering... Gosh.

969
00:56:26,306 --> 00:56:28,167
- I want to listen to that again. - Totally.

970
00:56:28,837 --> 00:56:30,936
(The master of concepts, Bang Yunha)

971
00:56:30,937 --> 00:56:32,477
- It was amazing. - Thank you.

972
00:56:34,846 --> 00:56:35,876
Great.

973
00:56:35,877 --> 00:56:39,285
The Unicorns, the producers, and the contestants...

974
00:56:39,286 --> 00:56:41,547
will now vote out one contestant to be eliminated.

975
00:56:42,457 --> 00:56:44,917
- How am I going to vote? - Gosh, I know how that feels.

976
00:56:45,727 --> 00:56:47,627
My heart feels heavy.

977
00:56:49,696 --> 00:56:53,026
There are several members I wish I saw more of.

978
00:56:53,027 --> 00:56:54,527
- Right. - Actually,

979
00:56:54,897 --> 00:56:58,095
- I wish Yeram was better today. - Yes.

980
00:56:58,096 --> 00:56:59,236
- Right. Yeram. - She could've done better.

981
00:56:59,237 --> 00:57:01,936
Huran and Sujin could have done better.

982
00:57:01,937 --> 00:57:04,535
You're right. This time, I barely noticed Nizi.

983
00:57:04,536 --> 00:57:05,536
- Right. - Right.

984
00:57:05,537 --> 00:57:07,606
(Key performers left a lot to be desired with this performance.)

985
00:57:07,607 --> 00:57:09,175
I think Eunhyung's part...

986
00:57:09,176 --> 00:57:11,445
- was supposed to be a highlight. - Right.

987
00:57:11,446 --> 00:57:13,716
- But she couldn't make that work. - She couldn't.

988
00:57:15,656 --> 00:57:18,416
To be honest, she looked like a regular kid among trainees.

989
00:57:18,417 --> 00:57:19,425
- I see. - Right.

990
00:57:19,426 --> 00:57:22,596
Seriously. She was below everyone's league.

991
00:57:22,957 --> 00:57:24,457
- Right. - That's how I felt.

992
00:57:25,127 --> 00:57:26,925
That's pretty sad. This is where it stops for her.

993
00:57:26,926 --> 00:57:28,027
This is it for her.

994
00:57:28,627 --> 00:57:31,667
(Which member will the Unicorns choose?)

995
00:57:32,406 --> 00:57:33,846
- Should we consider her? - Sort of.

996
00:57:34,067 --> 00:57:35,207
- Not her. - Right.

997
00:57:36,306 --> 00:57:40,345
For some reason, Sujin sort of looked out of place.

998
00:57:40,346 --> 00:57:42,047
Right. Her part was a bit anticlimactic.

999
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:43,846
Huran could have done better.

1000
00:57:44,277 --> 00:57:45,716
Huran didn't stand out at all.

1001
00:57:46,417 --> 00:57:48,487
Do you remember her part? Because I don't.

1002
00:57:50,957 --> 00:57:54,926
Eunhyung has a nice charm. I like her.

1003
00:57:56,957 --> 00:57:58,655
- Should we go with her? - Sujin?

1004
00:57:58,656 --> 00:58:00,103
(Which member will the producers choose?)

1005
00:58:00,127 --> 00:58:02,366
(The opposing unit will vote individually.)

1006
00:58:02,837 --> 00:58:04,937
The person I picked...

1007
00:58:05,707 --> 00:58:07,437
Is Lee Huran.

1008
00:58:07,737 --> 00:58:09,007
Sujin...

1009
00:58:10,477 --> 00:58:13,976
She didn't meet my expectations.

1010
00:58:13,977 --> 00:58:16,346
Eunhyung didn't stand out as much.

1011
00:58:16,477 --> 00:58:18,758
(Which member will receive the most votes from the unit?)

1012
00:58:20,286 --> 00:58:23,016
(Everyone has voted.)

1013
00:58:31,627 --> 00:58:33,925
We will now announce the members who were voted...

1014
00:58:33,926 --> 00:58:36,265
by the Unicorns, the producers, and the opposing unit...

1015
00:58:36,266 --> 00:58:38,136
and may face elimination.

1016
00:58:38,966 --> 00:58:40,846
(Possible Elimination Members for Unit Station)

1017
00:58:40,937 --> 00:58:42,007
Oh, no.

1018
00:58:48,076 --> 00:58:52,385
(The first member for possible elimination is revealed.)

1020
00:58:54,946 --> 00:58:55,986
I'm shaking.

1021
00:58:55,987 --> 00:58:57,616

1026
00:59:21,306 --> 00:59:23,175
Gosh. I can't watch this.

1027
00:59:23,176 --> 00:59:24,317
Me neither. I can't.

1028
00:59:28,386 --> 00:59:31,886
(The second member for possible elimination will be revealed.)

1029

(Kwon Eunhyung will be eliminated.)

1032
00:59:51,906 --> 00:59:52,977
Gosh.

The eliminated member of Unit "Yummy Yum" is...

1038
01:00:19,737 --> 01:00:21,437
Kwon Eunhyung.

1039
01:00:22,607 --> 01:00:24,277
Thank you for your hard work.

1040
01:00:24,576 --> 01:00:26,676
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1041
01:00:35,587 --> 01:00:36,817
I'm not crying yet.

1042
01:00:38,016 --> 01:00:39,856
- I'm not crying yet. - You're not crying yet.

1043
01:00:39,857 --> 01:00:40,886
Okay.

1044
01:00:45,227 --> 01:00:46,667
She's acting strong.

1045
01:00:56,337 --> 01:00:58,805
Don't cry. You were good.

1046
01:00:58,806 --> 01:01:00,506
- Seriously. - You were great.

1047
01:01:00,507 --> 01:01:02,006
- You were great. - Don't cry.

1048
01:01:02,007 --> 01:01:03,777
- Don't cry. - Stop crying.

1049
01:01:05,246 --> 01:01:07,646
(These are her friends who have been chasing the same dream.)

1050
01:01:07,647 --> 01:01:09,516
- Oh, no. - Don't cry.

1051
01:01:10,656 --> 01:01:12,015
- Don't cry. - No.

1052
01:01:12,016 --> 01:01:13,326
Why are you crying?

1053
01:01:13,727 --> 01:01:14,826
Why are you crying?

1054
01:01:15,227 --> 01:01:16,227
You were great.

1055
01:01:17,027 --> 01:01:18,127
We were great.

1056
01:01:20,826 --> 01:01:22,426
Why are you crying?

1057
01:01:22,866 --> 01:01:24,366
Come on. Deliver your speech.

1058
01:01:28,237 --> 01:01:31,937
I still have a lot to learn.

1059
01:01:32,437 --> 01:01:34,377
I will show...

1060
01:01:35,446 --> 01:01:36,945
only good performances...

1061
01:01:36,946 --> 01:01:38,506
if I have another chance in the future.

1062
01:01:38,917 --> 01:01:39,946
Thank you.

1063
01:01:41,087 --> 01:01:42,956
- She's so cool. - She's great.

1064
01:01:42,957 --> 01:01:43,987
That was cool.

Three of you were promoted...

1081
01:02:22,426 --> 01:02:24,546
thanks to Unicorn Ticketing at the last Unit Station.

1082
01:02:24,957 --> 01:02:28,266
Seowon, Narumi, and Kotoko...

1083
01:02:28,496 --> 01:02:30,837
had already advanced to the next level.

1084
01:02:34,567 --> 01:02:36,206
As for the second promotion ceremony,

1085
01:02:36,207 --> 01:02:40,146
we have received 3,886,101 votes for the past 10 days...

1086
01:02:40,147 --> 01:02:42,076
from all over the world.

1087
01:02:42,346 --> 01:02:45,346
These votes decided whether or not you can advance to the final stage.

1088
01:02:47,187 --> 01:02:48,646
As for the number of girls...

1089
01:02:48,647 --> 01:02:51,047
who will be promoted today and advance to the Final Station,

1090
01:02:51,886 --> 01:02:52,956
it's 16.

1091
01:02:52,957 --> 01:02:54,126
(Only 16 girls will perform at the Final Station.)

1092
01:02:54,127 --> 01:02:56,325
- Six of us will be eliminated. - Six of us will be eliminated.

1093
01:02:56,326 --> 01:02:58,195
(If the rest of them advance to R, 6 girls in S will be eliminated.)

1094
01:02:58,196 --> 01:03:01,465
Who will get to perform at the Final Station...

1095
01:03:01,466 --> 01:03:02,897
of Universe Ticket?

1096
01:03:03,596 --> 01:03:04,876
The second promotion ceremony...

1097
01:03:05,866 --> 01:03:07,167
begins now.

1098
01:03:07,966 --> 01:03:10,477
(The 2nd promotion ceremony begins in earnest.)

1099
01:03:14,246 --> 01:03:16,527
Here's the first pair of contestants to check the levels.

1100
01:03:17,946 --> 01:03:18,977
Goo Gyoryeon.

1101
01:03:20,016 --> 01:03:21,686
Jin Hyeonju. Come to the stage.

1102
01:03:21,687 --> 01:03:24,385
(Goo Gyoryeon and Jin Hyeonju will check their levels.)

1103
01:03:24,386 --> 01:03:25,515
- I'm nervous. - Good luck.

1104
01:03:25,516 --> 01:03:27,056
Good luck!

1105
01:03:34,897 --> 01:03:37,437
Goo Gyoryeon has often gotten the favor of Unicorn Ticketing.

1106
01:03:37,996 --> 01:03:40,106
Jin Hyeonju always scores high with Fan Ticketing.

1107
01:03:40,107 --> 01:03:42,676
We will now check their levels.

1108
01:03:45,707 --> 01:03:46,845
- That's amazing. - It's going up.

1109
01:03:46,846 --> 01:03:49,246
- This is great. - I think they'll go up.

1110
01:03:50,446 --> 01:03:52,047
There it goes. She's going to reach it.

1111
01:03:57,087 --> 01:04:00,027
(Goo Gyoryeon is eliminated.)

1112
01:04:03,596 --> 01:04:04,596
Congratulations.

1113
01:04:16,036 --> 01:04:18,305
I would like to thank my fans...

1114
01:04:18,306 --> 01:04:21,106
who voted for me, so I could advance to Level I.

1115
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:22,917
(Rank 10, Jin Hyeonju, Total: 191,581 points)

1116
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:26,986
Thank you for giving me a chance to perform until the end...

1117
01:04:26,987 --> 01:04:28,417
at the Final Station.

1118
01:04:30,516 --> 01:04:32,586
I will work really hard.

1119
01:04:32,587 --> 01:04:33,627
Thank you.

1120
01:04:37,826 --> 01:04:42,027
I really wanted to perform at the Final Station.

1121
01:04:43,636 --> 01:04:47,837
It's really sad that I won't be able to join.

1122
01:04:48,766 --> 01:04:51,976
But I sincerely thank you for supporting me...

1123
01:04:51,977 --> 01:04:54,147
and voting for me, so I could be here today.

1124
01:05:06,326 --> 01:05:08,526
The contestants who will check their levels next are...

1125
01:05:09,087 --> 01:05:11,155
the two sisters who performed together for the first time...

1126
01:05:11,156 --> 01:05:13,227
in the Performance Unit.

1127
01:05:13,966 --> 01:05:16,066
Bae Haram and Bae Yeram.

1128
01:05:16,067 --> 01:05:21,107
(Bae Haram and Bae Yeram will check their levels.)

1129
01:05:21,507 --> 01:05:25,075
They'll check their levels together like the first Promotion Ceremony.

1130
01:05:25,076 --> 01:05:27,576
What will happen to them?

1131
01:05:28,806 --> 01:05:32,647
Let's find out Bae Haram and Bae Yeram's levels now.

1132
01:05:44,027 --> 01:05:45,926
(Bae Haram is promoted to Level I.)

1133
01:05:46,527 --> 01:05:49,096
(Bae Yeram is eliminated.)

1134
01:06:01,607 --> 01:06:02,745
(Rank 14, Bae Haram, Total: 160,693.3 points)

1135
01:06:02,746 --> 01:06:06,487
My ranking was really low when we first started,

1136
01:06:06,746 --> 01:06:11,087
and I didn't think I'd be able to make it this far.

1137
01:06:11,187 --> 01:06:14,126
I think it's a complete miracle...

1138
01:06:14,127 --> 01:06:16,426
that I made it to the finals.

1139
01:06:18,196 --> 01:06:21,896
To those who made this miracle possible,

1140
01:06:21,897 --> 01:06:23,535
I'm deeply grateful.

1141
01:06:23,536 --> 01:06:24,536
But...

1142
01:06:27,837 --> 01:06:30,076
I'm getting promoted by myself,

1143
01:06:31,877 --> 01:06:35,207
and I can't be entirely happy.

1144
01:06:36,107 --> 01:06:39,986
I'm really sad about it. I'll work harder on behalf of Yeram,

1145
01:06:39,987 --> 01:06:41,616
and in the finals,

1146
01:06:41,846 --> 01:06:44,385
I won't let you down.

1147
01:06:44,386 --> 01:06:45,616
Thank you.

1148
01:06:49,556 --> 01:06:52,456
I know my sister will work harder on behalf of me.

1149
01:06:52,457 --> 01:06:54,866
I'll keep supporting her.

1150
01:07:18,917 --> 01:07:19,987
Oh Yoona...

1151
01:07:21,087 --> 01:07:23,726
and Lee Sunwoo. Please come up to the stage.

1152
01:07:23,727 --> 01:07:26,096
(Oh Yoona and Lee Sunwoo will check their levels.)

1153
01:07:30,966 --> 01:07:33,265
The two of them are currently Level S,

1154
01:07:33,266 --> 01:07:36,006
but one of them will be promoted to Level R,

1155
01:07:36,007 --> 01:07:38,377
which is two levels above.

1156
01:07:39,676 --> 01:07:42,346
Let's check their levels now.

1157
01:07:54,786 --> 01:07:56,786
(Oh Yoona and Lee Sunwoo are promoted to Level I.)

1158
01:08:00,926 --> 01:08:02,027
Who is it?

1159
01:08:02,866 --> 01:08:05,067
- Wait, what? - Oh, my gosh.

1160
01:08:18,346 --> 01:08:21,416
(Oh Yoona is promoted to Level R.)

1161
01:08:25,617 --> 01:08:29,186
(Rank 5, Oh Yoona, Total: 220,222.8 points)

1162
01:08:29,187 --> 01:08:32,897
(Rank 5, Oh Yoona, Total: 220,222.8 points)

1163
01:08:33,666 --> 01:08:36,635
I'm so happy to get promoted...

1164
01:08:36,636 --> 01:08:40,537
in the second Promotion Ceremony as well.

1165
01:08:40,636 --> 01:08:44,376
Up until the ceremony,

1166
01:08:44,806 --> 01:08:47,305
I wasn't sure if I was going to get promoted,

1167
01:08:47,306 --> 01:08:50,416
and I was really worried.

1168
01:08:50,617 --> 01:08:54,746
I'm really happy that I got promoted.

1169
01:08:54,747 --> 01:08:58,817
We don't have much time left until the finals,

1170
01:08:59,256 --> 01:09:01,385
so I'll work hard to prepare for it...

1171
01:09:01,386 --> 01:09:04,556
and return all your support with a good performance...

1172
01:09:05,357 --> 01:09:07,027
in the finals.

1173
01:09:07,227 --> 01:09:11,536
I want to thank all my fans who have shown me their love...

1174
01:09:11,537 --> 01:09:14,706
and trust with their votes. Thank you so much.

1175
01:09:15,737 --> 01:09:17,136
Thank you.

1176
01:09:19,437 --> 01:09:20,846
First of all,

1177
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:24,215
I couldn't have been promoted to Level I...

1178
01:09:24,216 --> 01:09:27,316
and made it to the finals...

1179
01:09:27,317 --> 01:09:30,886
without my fans worldwide. Thank you so much.

1180
01:09:32,817 --> 01:09:36,556
Although I'm only 0.1 percent away from Level R,

1181
01:09:36,857 --> 01:09:40,296
but I'm already so grateful...

1182
01:09:40,596 --> 01:09:42,996
for all the fan votes I've received.

1183
01:09:42,997 --> 01:09:45,266
I think it's more than I deserve.

1184
01:09:45,497 --> 01:09:47,306
I'll work harder for the finals...

1185
01:09:47,537 --> 01:09:51,236
to be one of the contestants who will make their debuts.

1186
01:09:51,237 --> 01:09:54,805
I'll do my very best to prepare a good performance.

1187
01:09:54,806 --> 01:09:56,617
Thank you so much.

1188
01:10:03,357 --> 01:10:04,456
Yoona!

1189
01:10:06,016 --> 01:10:08,287
Yoona, congratulations!

1190
01:10:13,367 --> 01:10:15,896
Everyone. Do you remember the Hidden Ticketing...

1191
01:10:15,897 --> 01:10:17,795
from the last Promotion Ceremony?

1192
01:10:17,796 --> 01:10:19,335
- Yes. - The Candy Ticketing.

1193
01:10:19,336 --> 01:10:22,367
It was the Candy Ticketing which was a voting among the contestants.

1194
01:10:22,607 --> 01:10:25,906
There's also a Hidden Ticketing this time.

1195
01:10:25,907 --> 01:10:28,607
- What is it? I got goosebumps. - Really?

1196
01:10:28,907 --> 01:10:30,817
What is the new Hidden Ticketing?

1197
01:10:31,716 --> 01:10:33,216
- Watch a video to find out. - What?

1198
01:10:33,287 --> 01:10:34,816
- What is it? - Really?

1199
01:10:34,817 --> 01:10:36,416
- A video? - No way.

1200
01:10:37,056 --> 01:10:38,287
Could it be...

1201
01:10:40,357 --> 01:10:42,886
(What is the Hidden Ticketing?)

1202
01:10:43,556 --> 01:10:46,055
(The second Hidden Ticketing, Producer Ticketing)

1203
01:10:46,056 --> 01:10:47,066
Unbelievable.

1204
01:10:47,067 --> 01:10:50,296
There are some of them that I'd hate to see go.

1205
01:10:50,397 --> 01:10:52,636
That's why we need to help them.

1206
01:10:52,697 --> 01:10:55,937
I'd like to give them a chance.

1207
01:10:56,166 --> 01:10:59,406
It should be someone who calmly followed our directions.

1208
01:10:59,407 --> 01:11:01,446
(Who will the producers give the ticket to?)

1209
01:11:01,447 --> 01:11:03,976
All right. Overall,

1210
01:11:03,977 --> 01:11:07,515
we should consider their skills and star quality,

1211
01:11:07,516 --> 01:11:09,786
- like their expressions onstage. - Sure.

1212
01:11:09,787 --> 01:11:12,215
We should look at their skills and overall balance.

1213
01:11:12,216 --> 01:11:13,886
Their singing, stage presence,

1214
01:11:14,227 --> 01:11:17,226
talent, and the balance between all these things.

1215
01:11:17,227 --> 01:11:20,766
In terms of balance, I think the all-rounder would be...

1216
01:11:21,096 --> 01:11:24,166
I think she has a lot of star quality.

1217
01:11:24,466 --> 01:11:27,566
- She's a big help to her teammates. - Yes.

1218
01:11:27,567 --> 01:11:29,265
- She's cheerful. - She's cheerful and energetic.

1219
01:11:29,266 --> 01:11:30,505
She lightens up the mood.

1220
01:11:30,506 --> 01:11:32,276
You need someone like that on your team.

1221
01:11:32,277 --> 01:11:34,976
- She has a good balance overall. - Yes.

1222
01:11:34,977 --> 01:11:37,915
Between her star quality and skills.

1223
01:11:37,916 --> 01:11:39,777
- She's very well-balanced. - Yes.

1224
01:11:40,687 --> 01:11:42,015
- Number one. - Yes.

1225
01:11:42,016 --> 01:11:43,356
(Each team of producers picks 3 best contestants.)

1226
01:11:43,357 --> 01:11:45,056
- Number two. - Yes.

1227
01:11:45,216 --> 01:11:46,286
Number three.

1228
01:11:46,287 --> 01:11:48,003
(Each team of producers picks 3 best contestants.)

1229
01:11:48,027 --> 01:11:49,255
- I'll write their names then. - Yes.

1230
01:11:49,256 --> 01:11:51,296
- There's no turning back. - Okay.

1231
01:11:51,626 --> 01:11:53,907
We, GALACTIKA, have chosen contestants for the ticketing.

1232
01:11:53,966 --> 01:11:55,227
They are...

1233
01:11:56,697 --> 01:11:58,095
Why would you not show it?

1234
01:11:58,096 --> 01:11:59,537
(Who won the Producer Ticketing?)

1235
01:12:01,466 --> 01:12:02,907
- How cute. - That was cute.

1236
01:12:03,876 --> 01:12:07,305
I'll announce the two finalists for the Producer Ticketing now.

1237
01:12:07,306 --> 01:12:08,746
(The 2 finalists will be announced.)

1238
01:12:09,277 --> 01:12:11,616
Both of them were so close...

1239
01:12:11,617 --> 01:12:14,886
to getting a ticket from the Unicorns in the Unit Station.

1240
01:12:17,516 --> 01:12:18,715
Bang Yunha.

1241
01:12:18,716 --> 01:12:22,226
(Bang Yunha)

1242
01:12:22,227 --> 01:12:23,425
Kim Sumin.

1243
01:12:23,426 --> 01:12:26,126
(Bang Yunha and Kim Sumin will check their levels.)

1244
01:12:28,926 --> 01:12:30,135
Good luck.

1245
01:12:30,136 --> 01:12:32,636
- They both deserve it. - You're right.

1246
01:12:33,937 --> 01:12:36,705
Universe Ticket. The winner of the Producer Ticketing.

1247
01:12:36,706 --> 01:12:38,106
(Who won the Producer Ticketing?)

1248
01:12:38,107 --> 01:12:39,737
Let's find out now.

1249
01:12:50,556 --> 01:12:57,197
(Kim Sumin won the Producer Ticketing.)

1250
01:12:57,256 --> 01:12:59,055
(Kim Sumin: 8 points, Bang Yunha: 3 points)

1251
01:12:59,056 --> 01:13:00,366
Congratulations.

1252
01:13:00,367 --> 01:13:03,336
Now, let's see the results of the Fan Ticketing.

1253
01:13:04,666 --> 01:13:07,666
(Will the two of them be able to get promoted?)

1254
01:13:15,477 --> 01:13:18,046
- Let's go. - Come on.

1255
01:13:18,277 --> 01:13:20,546
It's going fast. Almost there.

1256
01:13:31,956 --> 01:13:32,997
Amazing.

1257
01:13:34,596 --> 01:13:37,036
(Bang Yunha and Kim Sumin are promoted to Level S.)

1258
01:13:37,037 --> 01:13:38,965
(Rank 8, Kim Sumin, Total: 208,870 points)

1259
01:13:38,966 --> 01:13:42,567
I'd like to thank the producers...

1260
01:13:44,006 --> 01:13:48,205
for choosing me. Thank you so much.

1261
01:13:48,206 --> 01:13:51,117
I also want to thank my fans who voted for me...

1262
01:13:52,577 --> 01:13:55,117
and supported me...

1263
01:13:55,287 --> 01:13:58,715
so I could get promoted.

1264
01:13:58,716 --> 01:14:01,456
Thank you so much.

1265
01:14:01,787 --> 01:14:02,886
I will...

1266
01:14:05,056 --> 01:14:09,026
work harder and keep improving myself.

1267
01:14:09,027 --> 01:14:10,567
Thank you very much.

1268
01:14:14,737 --> 01:14:18,277
At the beginning of the show,

1269
01:14:18,607 --> 01:14:21,176
the finals seemed so far away,

1270
01:14:21,777 --> 01:14:25,876
and I could only imagine how it'd be.

1271
01:14:26,046 --> 01:14:29,487
But it's right around the corner now,

1272
01:14:29,687 --> 01:14:34,055
and my fans have given me a chance to perform in the finals...

1273
01:14:34,056 --> 01:14:36,925
with my fellow candidates.

1274
01:14:36,926 --> 01:14:41,226
Thank you so much. I'd like to express...

1275
01:14:41,227 --> 01:14:45,567
my sincere gratitude to you.

1276
01:14:45,937 --> 01:14:48,135
Thank you for all your votes.

1277
01:14:48,136 --> 01:14:50,937
(Thank you for all your votes.)

1278
01:15:01,647 --> 01:15:04,987
Next up are the 2 beautiful girls born in 2009.

1279
01:15:05,657 --> 01:15:06,727
Gabi.

1280
01:15:07,727 --> 01:15:10,197
Hwang Sieun. Please come up to the stage.

1281
01:15:10,327 --> 01:15:11,357
You got this.

1282
01:15:17,197 --> 01:15:19,937
Let's check their levels.

1283
01:15:22,706 --> 01:15:23,737
Please.

1284
01:15:24,407 --> 01:15:25,407
Please.

1285
01:15:47,766 --> 01:15:51,635
I'd like to thank my fans and family...

1286
01:15:51,636 --> 01:15:54,265
for giving me...

1287
01:15:54,266 --> 01:15:57,037
such a good opportunity.

1288
01:15:57,336 --> 01:15:58,806
Thank you.

1289
01:16:02,907 --> 01:16:04,477
Well, first of all,

1290
01:16:04,577 --> 01:16:09,716
I'd like to thank my fans for voting for me.

1291
01:16:09,916 --> 01:16:12,657
I'll return your support...

1292
01:16:12,716 --> 01:16:16,255
with a better performance. I won't let you down.

1293
01:16:16,256 --> 01:16:17,657
Thank you.

1294
01:16:22,926 --> 01:16:24,897
Next contestants to check their levels are...

1295
01:16:25,737 --> 01:16:26,907
Jeon Jinyeong.

1296
01:16:26,966 --> 01:16:29,407
Jayla. Please come up to the stage.

1297
01:16:29,766 --> 01:16:30,937
Let's go.

1298
01:16:37,216 --> 01:16:38,277
Good luck!

1299
01:16:38,817 --> 01:16:40,046
The third contestant...

1300
01:16:40,617 --> 01:16:44,016
to be eliminated in this second Promotion Ceremony...

1301
01:16:44,687 --> 01:16:45,787
is 1 of these 2.

1302
01:16:45,857 --> 01:16:48,027
- Oh, no. - No.

1303
01:16:48,556 --> 01:16:49,986
What are their levels?

1304
01:16:49,987 --> 01:16:51,125
(Who will end her journey here?)

1305
01:16:51,126 --> 01:16:52,256
Let's see it.

1306
01:17:15,546 --> 01:17:18,956
(Jeon Jinyeong is promoted to Level I.)

1307
01:17:19,056 --> 01:17:21,987
(Jayla is eliminated.)

1308
01:17:26,897 --> 01:17:30,067
Although I'm really sad about this,

1309
01:17:32,897 --> 01:17:35,067
but I got to practice with everyone...

1310
01:17:36,237 --> 01:17:38,937
until earlier today, and I had so much fun.

1311
01:17:40,447 --> 01:17:42,276
Thank you.

1312
01:17:42,277 --> 01:17:44,647
(Thank you.)

1313
01:17:48,687 --> 01:17:51,286
(Rank 15, Jeon Jinyeong, Total: 135,604.8 points)

1314
01:17:51,287 --> 01:17:54,157
I really can't believe it.

1315
01:17:57,357 --> 01:18:01,697
First of all, thank you for voting for me.

1316
01:18:03,897 --> 01:18:08,666
I wanted to make it to the finals, and I prayed for it every day.

1317
01:18:10,706 --> 01:18:15,176
I feel like I'm one step closer to my dream now,

1318
01:18:16,107 --> 01:18:17,647
which makes me so happy.

1319
01:18:18,176 --> 01:18:22,317
I want to tell Jayla that her hard work is deeply appreciated.

1320
01:18:22,416 --> 01:18:23,787
Thank you.

1321
01:18:38,537 --> 01:18:42,036
Now, we will check the levels of those who won...

1322
01:18:42,037 --> 01:18:44,737
the Unicorn Ticketing in the Unit Station.

1323
01:18:46,376 --> 01:18:47,407
Narumi.

1324
01:18:48,376 --> 01:18:51,117
Kotoko. Please come up to the stage.

1325
01:18:52,346 --> 01:18:53,886
You got this.

1326
01:18:58,056 --> 01:19:00,256
Gosh. Don't cry.

1327
01:19:01,056 --> 01:19:03,527
- You shouldn't be crying already. - Oh, boy.

1328
01:19:12,966 --> 01:19:14,136
Is either of them...

1329
01:19:14,607 --> 01:19:17,907
going to be promoted to Level R?

1330
01:19:20,846 --> 01:19:24,277
Let's check the two contestants' levels now.

1331
01:19:44,966 --> 01:19:46,665
(Kotoko is promoted to Level R.)

1332
01:19:46,666 --> 01:19:47,826
She looks like a little girl.

1333
01:19:47,966 --> 01:19:50,706
(Narumi remains at Level I.)

1334
01:19:54,176 --> 01:19:55,277
Good for her.

1335
01:19:56,107 --> 01:19:57,545
(Rank 6, Kotoko, Total: 218,019.9 points)

1336
01:19:57,546 --> 01:19:58,616
To...

1337
01:19:58,617 --> 01:20:01,015
(Rank 6, Kotoko, Total: 218,019.9 points)

1338
01:20:01,016 --> 01:20:02,715
To be honest...

1339
01:20:02,716 --> 01:20:04,055
(Rank 6, Kotoko, Total: 218,019.9 points)

1340
01:20:04,056 --> 01:20:06,415
I didn't think...

1341
01:20:06,416 --> 01:20:12,227
I was going to make it this far at first.

1342
01:20:12,527 --> 01:20:19,336
Although I'm happy that I've made it to the finals,

1343
01:20:20,096 --> 01:20:25,607
the person I like so much has been eliminated...

1344
01:20:30,676 --> 01:20:33,516
My dear friend has been eliminated.

1345
01:20:37,287 --> 01:20:38,456
But...

1346
01:20:40,317 --> 01:20:41,426
since...

1347
01:20:42,626 --> 01:20:45,296
I made it to the finals,

1348
01:20:46,857 --> 01:20:48,866
I'll do my best.

1349
01:20:48,867 --> 01:20:51,366
(I'll do my best on her behalf.)

1350
01:20:51,367 --> 01:20:52,497
And...

1351
01:20:54,567 --> 01:20:59,577
I want to thank my fans...

1352
01:21:00,577 --> 01:21:06,516
for voting for me. Thank you so much.

1353
01:21:06,716 --> 01:21:09,216
I'll work harder.

1354
01:21:09,487 --> 01:21:10,886
Thank you.

1355
01:21:14,827 --> 01:21:16,326
(Rank 11, Narumi, Total: 181,369.4 points)

1356
01:21:16,327 --> 01:21:19,056
I want to thank my fans and family...

1357
01:21:19,126 --> 01:21:24,067
for always believing in me and voting for me.

1358
01:21:24,737 --> 01:21:28,067
Thank you so much.

1359
01:21:43,756 --> 01:21:45,715
There are four Level S contestants...

1360
01:21:45,716 --> 01:21:47,556
who are still waiting to check their levels,

1361
01:21:48,357 --> 01:21:49,756
and only one of them...

1362
01:21:50,056 --> 01:21:51,157
will get promoted.

1363
01:21:52,296 --> 01:21:53,816
Who among the remaining contestants...

1364
01:21:53,997 --> 01:21:55,296
will get promoted?

1365
01:21:57,067 --> 01:21:58,237
Kim Sujin.

1366
01:21:58,997 --> 01:22:01,866
Lee Huran. Please come up to the stage.

1367
01:22:01,867 --> 01:22:05,706
(Kim Sujin and Lee Huran will check their levels.)

1368
01:22:08,107 --> 01:22:11,046
Let's check their levels now.

1369
01:22:28,926 --> 01:22:31,766
(Kim Sujin and Lee Huran are eliminated.)

1370
01:22:48,916 --> 01:22:53,216
Universe Ticket has made me grow so much.

1371
01:22:54,256 --> 01:22:58,056
I couldn't have grown...

1372
01:22:58,157 --> 01:23:01,727
without the other contestants. They supported me,

1373
01:23:02,126 --> 01:23:03,526
helped me grow,

1374
01:23:03,527 --> 01:23:07,306
and made all the practice sessions so much fun.

1375
01:23:08,867 --> 01:23:13,407
I'd like to express my sincere gratitude to them.

1376
01:23:17,147 --> 01:23:19,846
My dream doesn't end here.

1377
01:23:20,046 --> 01:23:23,616
I'll keep getting better,

1378
01:23:23,617 --> 01:23:24,856
so please support me.

1379
01:23:24,857 --> 01:23:26,056
Thank you.

1380
01:23:33,926 --> 01:23:37,335
Although there were hard times...

1381
01:23:37,336 --> 01:23:40,266
on my way up to here,

1382
01:23:40,567 --> 01:23:42,205
to look back,

1383
01:23:42,206 --> 01:23:44,777
I only remember happy moments.

1384
01:23:45,206 --> 01:23:49,506
Universe Ticket will be one of my precious memories.

1385
01:23:50,006 --> 01:23:52,946
Since I did my very best...

1386
01:23:52,947 --> 01:23:57,016
to play my part and perform well in each round,

1387
01:23:57,687 --> 01:24:00,827
I think of myself as the winner in my heart.

1388
01:24:01,687 --> 01:24:02,857
And...

1389
01:24:03,426 --> 01:24:07,626
I'll be back as a better person.

1390
01:24:07,727 --> 01:24:11,197
I hope you'll still love me when I do.

1391
01:24:11,266 --> 01:24:12,666
Thank you.

1392
01:24:19,977 --> 01:24:23,747
Nizi, Yuri. Please come up to the stage.

1393
01:24:29,687 --> 01:24:30,755
They are...

1394
01:24:30,756 --> 01:24:33,926
at the last crossroads between survival and elimination.

1395
01:24:33,987 --> 01:24:36,256
Who will be the one to survive?

1396
01:24:38,256 --> 01:24:39,657
Let's find out...

1397
01:24:41,126 --> 01:24:42,466
their levels now.

1398
01:24:53,277 --> 01:24:57,046
(Who will be the one to survive?)

1399
01:24:58,589 --> 01:25:01,420
Let's find out their levels now.

1400
01:25:04,130 --> 01:25:07,259
(Between the two contestants, who will survive?)

1401
01:25:21,179 --> 01:25:22,179
Is it Nizi?

1402
01:25:23,009 --> 01:25:27,120
(Nizi has been eliminated.)

1403
01:25:41,130 --> 01:25:43,029
To be honest,

1404
01:25:43,030 --> 01:25:44,569
(16th, Yuri)

1405
01:25:44,570 --> 01:25:46,039
I didn't have much confidence today.

1406
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:47,298
(Total: 129,701.4 points)

1407
01:25:47,299 --> 01:25:50,939
I was very scared of checking out the result.

1408
01:25:52,410 --> 01:25:54,710
But I ended up...

1409
01:25:56,149 --> 01:25:58,320
moving on to the finals.

1410
01:25:59,979 --> 01:26:01,280
I am overjoyed...

1411
01:26:03,049 --> 01:26:04,149
and happy.

1412
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:08,019
Thank you so much.

1413
01:26:15,030 --> 01:26:19,969
Dear fans who voted for me,

1414
01:26:20,299 --> 01:26:22,439
thank you so much.

1415
01:26:24,110 --> 01:26:25,710
The time I spent...

1416
01:26:27,210 --> 01:26:31,148
with the older girls and my peers...

1417
01:26:31,149 --> 01:26:36,290
was so fun and joyous.

1418
01:26:38,689 --> 01:26:40,559
Although I am a bit sad,

1419
01:26:41,389 --> 01:26:44,860
but Universe Ticket isn't the end of my story.

1420
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,869
So I will work harder from now on.

1421
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:50,299
Thank you.

1422
01:27:01,210 --> 01:27:03,110
You did well.

1423
01:27:07,250 --> 01:27:08,789
(The 2nd Promotion Ceremony)

1424
01:27:08,790 --> 01:27:10,750
The Second Promotion Ceremony of Universe Ticket.

1425
01:27:11,049 --> 01:27:14,120
We will now see if Nana and Lim Seowon of Level R...

1426
01:27:14,689 --> 01:27:17,489
and Elisia an Gehlee Dangca of Level I...

1427
01:27:17,490 --> 01:27:19,200
were promoted.

1428
01:27:20,259 --> 01:27:22,199
Among the four contestants whose names were called,

1429
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:25,439
one will be promoted to the PRISM level...

1430
01:27:25,769 --> 01:27:27,239
and have her debut confirmed...

1431
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:29,239
(One will be promoted to the PRISM level.)

1432
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:30,309
right now.

1433
01:27:34,509 --> 01:27:37,580
Who will have the honor to debut before anyone else?

1434
01:27:38,479 --> 01:27:39,679
Let's find out.

1435
01:27:41,519 --> 01:27:42,519
Gehlee Dangca...

1436
01:27:43,490 --> 01:27:46,160
and Nana, come up to the stage.

1437
01:27:46,719 --> 01:27:47,719
Come on.

1438
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:49,660
- You got this. - Come up to the stage.

1439
01:27:50,429 --> 01:27:51,490
Good luck.

1440
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:53,429
- Good luck. - Good luck.

1441
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,039
You got this.

1442
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:02,338
These 2 contestants ranked 1st and 2nd...

1443
01:28:02,339 --> 01:28:05,080
in the First Promotion Ceremony.

1444
01:28:06,040 --> 01:28:09,279
Nana succeeded in all kinds of ticketing with ease...

1445
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:11,348
and became the first contestant to be promoted to Level R.

1446
01:28:11,349 --> 01:28:12,779
(Nana succeeded in Unicorn, Fan, and Candy Ticketings.)

1447
01:28:12,780 --> 01:28:14,348
As for Gehlee Dangca,

1448
01:28:14,349 --> 01:28:17,689
she filled 90 percent of Level I through Unicorn Ticketing...

1449
01:28:17,950 --> 01:28:20,159
and a high score in Fan Ticketing.

1450
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:21,830
(She was promoted to Level I.)

1451
01:28:22,330 --> 01:28:24,759
In the Second Promotion Ceremony,

1452
01:28:25,330 --> 01:28:27,999
will they surprise everyone again?

1453
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,268
(Will they surprise everyone again?)

1454
01:28:30,269 --> 01:28:31,530
Let's check...

1455
01:28:32,870 --> 01:28:34,000
the two contestants' levels.

1456
01:28:42,410 --> 01:28:44,349
(Gehlee Dangca has been promoted to Level R.)

1457
01:28:51,889 --> 01:28:55,660
(Her gauge continues to go up even when Nana's stops.)

1458
01:29:07,899 --> 01:29:09,468
It was so close.

1459
01:29:09,469 --> 01:29:12,679
(Gehlee Dangca has been promoted to Level R.)

1460
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:15,110
(Nana has been promoted to Level R.)

1461
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:17,979
All right.

1462
01:29:19,420 --> 01:29:23,189
Since I was only one promotion away...

1463
01:29:23,549 --> 01:29:27,759
from debut, I am a bit disappointed.

1464
01:29:28,460 --> 01:29:32,759
But I made it to the finals.

1465
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:35,830
So that I can debut at the finals,

1466
01:29:36,370 --> 01:29:37,898
I will practice hard...

1467
01:29:37,899 --> 01:29:40,870
and give a cool performance.

1468
01:29:41,910 --> 01:29:43,410
Thank you.

1469
01:29:48,410 --> 01:29:49,610
I am thankful...

1470
01:29:50,250 --> 01:29:53,280
for the fans.

1471
01:29:53,780 --> 01:29:55,048
From now on,

1472
01:29:55,049 --> 01:29:56,819
(2nd, Gehlee Dangca)

1473
01:29:56,820 --> 01:30:00,859
I will continue to do well.

1474
01:30:00,860 --> 01:30:04,660
Please root for me and look forward to my performance...

1475
01:30:05,330 --> 01:30:06,558
at the finals.

1476
01:30:06,559 --> 01:30:08,228
I will do my best.

1477
01:30:08,229 --> 01:30:10,099
Thank you so much. I love you.

1478
01:30:27,450 --> 01:30:29,410
The Second Promotion Ceremony of Universe Ticket.

1479
01:30:30,019 --> 01:30:31,149
Now comes the last part.

1480
01:30:33,219 --> 01:30:34,259
Lim Seowon...

1481
01:30:35,729 --> 01:30:36,929
and Elisia,

1482
01:30:37,759 --> 01:30:39,159
come up to the stage.

1483
01:30:39,160 --> 01:30:41,130
(Lim Seowon and Elisia's levels will be checked.)

1484
01:30:43,830 --> 01:30:44,870
Good luck.

1485
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:47,040
Seowon.

1486
01:30:49,710 --> 01:30:50,740
Good luck.

1487
01:30:51,110 --> 01:30:53,439
Let's go together.

1488
01:30:54,009 --> 01:30:55,040
Shall we go together?

1489
01:30:59,549 --> 01:31:02,349
In "WHATEVA," "Beautiful," and "Dream Girl,"

1490
01:31:03,149 --> 01:31:05,258
Lim Seowon and Elisia competed in good faith...

1491
01:31:05,259 --> 01:31:06,990
for the main vocalist position.

1492
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:11,460
Between the two contestants, the PRISM level will be reached...

1493
01:31:14,229 --> 01:31:15,299
by one.

1494
01:31:20,299 --> 01:31:24,008
Which contestant will have her debut confirmed first?

1495
01:31:24,009 --> 01:31:27,638
(Who will reach Level P and have her debut confirmed?)

1496
01:31:27,639 --> 01:31:29,910
The first debut member of Universe Ticket...

1497
01:31:31,049 --> 01:31:32,518
will be revealed now.

1498
01:31:32,519 --> 01:31:33,880
(Revealing the first debut member)

1499
01:31:34,549 --> 01:31:35,689
How nerve-racking.

1500
01:31:51,969 --> 01:31:53,039
Let's go.

1501
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:54,468
- Please. - Come on.

1502
01:31:54,469 --> 01:31:55,569

01:31:55,570 --> 01:31:57,040
- Please. - Come on.

1504
01:31:57,410 --> 01:32:01,880
(What will be the fate of the two contestants?)

1505
01:32:03,699 --> 01:32:05,130
It will be revealed now.

1506
01:32:13,569 --> 01:32:17,579
(The gauge goes up toward debut.)

1507
01:32:24,819 --> 01:32:26,720
- Come on. - Elisia.

1508
01:32:29,189 --> 01:32:31,159

01:32:56,479 --> 01:33:01,148
(Elisia's debut has been confirmed.)

1512
01:33:01,149 --> 01:33:02,219
(1st, Elisia)

1513
01:33:02,220 --> 01:33:04,759
(Total: 781,987.1 points)

1514
01:33:04,760 --> 01:33:05,959
We now have...

1515

Thank you so much.

1520
01:33:35,850 --> 01:33:36,890
I...

1521
01:33:38,819 --> 01:33:42,359
I prepared a speech earlier, but...

1522
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:46,399
I forgot everything.

1523
01:33:49,199 --> 01:33:50,199
Well...

1524
01:33:54,670 --> 01:33:57,180
Am I dreaming?

1525
01:34:00,750 --> 01:34:06,389
I want to thank the fans for voting...

1526
01:34:06,390 --> 01:34:08,219

Although my debut hasn't been confirmed,

1535
01:34:34,810 --> 01:34:38,050
I am in Level R. I only have one level to go.

1536
01:34:38,119 --> 01:34:40,318
I will work hard and practice...

1537
01:34:40,319 --> 01:34:42,448
so that I can reach the PRISM level.

1538
01:34:42,449 --> 01:34:46,188
I will make sure I get promoted and debut.

1539
01:34:46,189 --> 01:34:49,688

1540
