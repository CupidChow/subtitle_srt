If I lose?

105
00:05:01,194 --> 00:05:03,404
I'm sure I won't lose.

106
00:05:05,565 --> 00:05:08,234
It was somebody you knew, and you thought you would win.

107

00:10:13,455 --> 00:10:15,685
I'm really curious about this one.

185
00:10:16,356 --> 00:10:17,476
It's making me feel nervous.

186
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:20,555
It surely must be 5 to 0.

187
00:10:21,396 --> 00:10:23,064
It was 70 to 30 for me.

188
00:10:23,065 --> 00:10:25,065
I was 70 percent confident to win.

189
00:10:25,366 --> 00:10:26,686
(33rd Ahn Seungbi, 49th Oh Yoona)

190
00:10:29,906 --> 00:10:31,305
Thank you.

191
00:10:35,305 --> 00:10:36,405
What a shame.

192
00:10:36,406 --> 00:10:38,005
It was really close.

193
00:10:38,006 --> 00:10:41,145
The winner of this battle is Ahn Seungbi.

194
00:10:41,146 --> 00:10:43,285
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

195
00:10:43,286 --> 00:10:45,616
- You did really well, Yoona. - Thank you.

196
00:10:48,555 --> 00:10:50,925
What a shame. They both did really well.

197
00:10:52,396 --> 00:10:53,825
Congrats!

198
00:10:53,996 --> 00:10:55,195
Thank you!

199
00:10:56,766 --> 00:10:58,126
It was tough.

200
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,536
I felt...

201
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:08,636
wronged.

202
00:11:10,205 --> 00:11:11,905
I performed everything live.

203
00:11:11,906 --> 00:11:14,646
She performed separately for dancing and singing.

204
00:11:18,986 --> 00:11:21,356
I'm ready to grit my teeth.

205
00:11:21,856 --> 00:11:25,996
I will definitely make sure to win the next battle.

206
00:11:27,756 --> 00:11:29,695
We'll continue with the next battle.

207
00:11:30,295 --> 00:11:33,636
(36th Jang Sua versus 53rd Narumi)

208
00:11:34,766 --> 00:11:36,304
(36th, Korea, Jang Sua)

209
00:11:36,305 --> 00:11:38,305
Look how tall they are.

210
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:40,435
What's going on?

211
00:11:40,736 --> 00:11:42,544
My goodness. Look at them.

212
00:11:42,545 --> 00:11:43,945
They look like models.

213
00:11:44,476 --> 00:11:46,714
A clash of cute and sexy.

214
00:11:46,715 --> 00:11:49,016
Gosh. They're so pretty.

215
00:11:49,715 --> 00:11:52,955
Hello. I'm the happiness virus, Jang Sua.

216
00:11:53,715 --> 00:11:55,015
Has it been a week since you joined the agency?

217
00:11:55,016 --> 00:11:56,025
Yes.

218
00:11:56,026 --> 00:11:57,232
(During the audition, she was a week-old rookie trainee.)

219
00:11:57,256 --> 00:11:59,355
I had an audition through my academy.

220
00:11:59,356 --> 00:12:01,424
I got in after passing that audition.

221
00:12:01,425 --> 00:12:02,965
How long did you attend the academy?

222
00:12:03,226 --> 00:12:04,795
Around four months.

223
00:12:05,435 --> 00:12:07,495
(What position does rookie trainee Jang Sua want?)

224
00:12:07,496 --> 00:12:09,636
Cute visual center.

225
00:12:10,335 --> 00:12:12,505
IU was known as the nation's younger sister.

226
00:12:12,506 --> 00:12:15,545
I want to be called the nation's younger cousin.

227
00:12:15,606 --> 00:12:17,175
Why the nation's younger cousin?

228
00:12:18,075 --> 00:12:20,376
Because the younger sister already exists.

229
00:12:20,675 --> 00:12:23,815
(This girl dreams of becoming the nation's younger cousin.)

230
00:12:23,915 --> 00:12:27,115
I wanted to strengthen my skills through this audition program...

231
00:12:27,116 --> 00:12:30,526
and also make great experiences.

232
00:12:30,656 --> 00:12:31,856
That's why I applied.

233
00:12:32,226 --> 00:12:33,226
Awesome.

234
00:12:33,726 --> 00:12:35,095
Hello.

235
00:12:38,526 --> 00:12:40,965
(She wants to be good friends with the camera.)

236
00:12:41,496 --> 00:12:42,736
There's a camera here.

237
00:12:43,036 --> 00:12:44,065
(Amazed)

238
00:12:49,545 --> 00:12:53,476
I will make sure to go through any storm.

239
00:13:00,555 --> 00:13:03,486
("Smiley" by Jang Sua)

240
00:13:04,425 --> 00:13:05,425
She's so cute.

241
00:13:05,496 --> 00:13:06,925
How pretty.

242
00:13:19,406 --> 00:13:20,505
She's so cute.

243
00:13:20,506 --> 00:13:21,876
She's looking at the camera.

244
00:14:06,756 --> 00:14:07,955
How cute.

245
00:14:08,756 --> 00:14:09,925
So cute.

246
00:14:14,555 --> 00:14:15,626
She's so cute.

247
00:14:24,065 --> 00:14:25,335
She's so cute.

248
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:26,976
She's so bright.

249
00:14:28,175 --> 00:14:29,276
She's a cute one.

250
00:14:29,746 --> 00:14:31,646
So cute.

251
00:14:32,376 --> 00:14:33,575
She's so pretty.

252
00:14:34,246 --> 00:14:35,685
Thank you.

253
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,486
(Am I allowed to go down? Or not?)

254
00:14:40,156 --> 00:14:41,386
You may go down.

255
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,555
You may go down.

256
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:45,555
- She's too cute. - Okay.

257
00:14:47,055 --> 00:14:49,996
We'll see the lower ranker's performance next.

258
00:14:53,565 --> 00:14:56,535
- What is she up to with that? - It's a long chair.

259
00:14:56,536 --> 00:14:57,536
I love it!

260
00:14:57,965 --> 00:14:59,006
This is great!

261
00:14:59,175 --> 00:15:01,575
- Props? - I love props.

262
00:15:05,406 --> 00:15:08,246
Gosh. She's like a model.

263
00:15:09,815 --> 00:15:11,314
Hello.

264
00:15:11,315 --> 00:15:13,616
I'm Narumi, and I live in Tokyo.

265
00:15:14,886 --> 00:15:18,885
I'm 172cm tall. I have long legs and arms.

266
00:15:18,886 --> 00:15:22,766
My mesmerizing dancing skills are my weapon.

267
00:15:25,366 --> 00:15:29,205
I have loved K-pop artists ever since I was in elementary school.

268
00:15:29,536 --> 00:15:34,536
I have been practicing for five hours every day.

269
00:15:35,575 --> 00:15:36,746
Today,

270
00:15:37,705 --> 00:15:40,675
I have been really practicing my singing and dancing.

271
00:15:41,675 --> 00:15:43,945
That's why I'm exhausted right now.

272
00:15:44,815 --> 00:15:45,915
But now,

273
00:15:46,886 --> 00:15:52,156
I will start studying Korean.

274
00:15:53,626 --> 00:15:55,155
Do you have plans tomorrow?

275
00:15:55,156 --> 00:15:56,695
Do you have plans tomorrow?

276
00:15:57,325 --> 00:15:59,065
I watch television.

277
00:15:59,866 --> 00:16:02,195
Shall we eat this?

278
00:16:02,835 --> 00:16:06,006
It's both our first time seeing each other as student and teacher.

279
00:16:06,205 --> 00:16:07,735
Oh, I see.

280
00:16:07,736 --> 00:16:10,775
I want to become a K-pop artist.

281
00:16:10,776 --> 00:16:15,276
That's why I've been studying Korean for two hours every day.

282
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:18,144
I want to become a K-pop artist...

283
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:22,756
who loves and gets loved by Korean fans and global fans.

284
00:16:23,585 --> 00:16:26,294
I will show you everything...

285
00:16:26,295 --> 00:16:30,825
that I have prepared while pursuing my dream.

286
00:16:33,536 --> 00:16:36,936
("Gotta Go" by Narumi)

287
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:38,166
That's it.

288
00:16:54,216 --> 00:16:55,315
Let's go!

289
00:17:09,105 --> 00:17:10,266
She dances well.

290
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:33,795
That's so pretty.

291
00:17:34,895 --> 00:17:36,125
She's so cool.

292
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:40,166
Her body lines are beautiful.

293
00:17:46,635 --> 00:17:47,834
This is unbelievable.

294
00:17:47,835 --> 00:17:49,006
She's amazing.

295
00:17:54,246 --> 00:17:55,276
She's so good.

296
00:18:16,835 --> 00:18:18,206
Her body lines are beautiful.

297
00:18:18,605 --> 00:18:20,536
I can tell she practiced a lot.

298
00:18:20,835 --> 00:18:23,905
Her gestures and everything look just the same as Chungha's.

299
00:18:24,976 --> 00:18:27,245
Things like this.

300
00:18:27,246 --> 00:18:28,946
She looks like Chungha when she does this.

301
00:18:29,786 --> 00:18:31,115
Thank you.

302
00:18:31,716 --> 00:18:33,256
I envy you...

303
00:18:33,756 --> 00:18:35,076
that you have long arms and legs.

304
00:18:36,426 --> 00:18:37,786
As she moved,

305
00:18:38,585 --> 00:18:40,054
I could hear the whooshing sound...

306
00:18:40,055 --> 00:18:41,555
- Right. - even from here.

307
00:18:41,895 --> 00:18:43,166
Gosh, it was really...

308
00:18:43,726 --> 00:18:45,726
I like what you have.

309
00:18:46,365 --> 00:18:47,536
Good luck.

310
00:18:47,865 --> 00:18:55,036
I think Narumi suits the dance of the song, "Gotta Go."

311
00:18:55,135 --> 00:19:00,246
The dance looks great when you use your hips well.

312
00:19:00,315 --> 00:19:03,245
And your hips were standing out.

313
00:19:03,246 --> 00:19:05,585
Since you have slim arms and legs,

314
00:19:05,746 --> 00:19:07,716
every move you made looked nice.

315
00:19:07,786 --> 00:19:12,124
I liked how it felt as if you were dwelling on it.

316
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:13,325
Thank you.

317
00:19:19,966 --> 00:19:22,496
(Sneaking)

318
00:19:23,506 --> 00:19:25,804
This is what we talked...

319
00:19:25,805 --> 00:19:27,604
about Sua's performance.

320
00:19:27,605 --> 00:19:29,675
I liked the energy you gave off on stage.

321
00:19:29,676 --> 00:19:31,476
It made us smile.

322
00:19:31,575 --> 00:19:33,716
But to be honest,

323
00:19:33,976 --> 00:19:36,045
- you didn't perform so well, right? - Yes.

324
00:19:36,085 --> 00:19:38,716
But I could tell you were being energetic.

325
00:19:38,815 --> 00:19:42,216
I don't want you to lose that confidence on stage.

326
00:19:43,526 --> 00:19:44,655
(36th Jang Sua, 53rd Narumi)

327
00:19:50,595 --> 00:19:52,495
- The winner of this battle... - I can't believe it.

328
00:19:52,496 --> 00:19:54,095
- Thank you. - is Narumi.

329
00:19:54,135 --> 00:19:55,665
Congratulations.

330
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,135
Thank you.

331
00:19:59,236 --> 00:20:00,835
(Thumbs-up)

332
00:20:02,605 --> 00:20:04,574
- She's adorable. - Sua is so lovely.

333
00:20:04,575 --> 00:20:06,246
She's really charming.

334
00:20:07,246 --> 00:20:08,675
If I get another chance,

335
00:20:08,676 --> 00:20:11,946
I want to do things right without making a mistake.

336
00:20:14,186 --> 00:20:16,226
We're ready for the next battle.

337
00:20:18,026 --> 00:20:19,155
She's finally here.

338
00:20:19,726 --> 00:20:21,086
I've been looking forward to this.

339
00:20:21,456 --> 00:20:22,696
I was really curious.

340
00:20:23,895 --> 00:20:25,025
(7th Gabi)

341
00:20:25,026 --> 00:20:26,936
- Gabi. - The one from the teaser.

342
00:20:26,966 --> 00:20:28,865
I'm so curious.

343
00:20:29,835 --> 00:20:32,834
(7th Gabi)

344
00:20:32,835 --> 00:20:33,875
She's pretty.

345
00:20:34,105 --> 00:20:35,536
So she's Gabi.

346
00:20:36,545 --> 00:20:37,706
She's beautiful.

347
00:20:38,776 --> 00:20:42,845
Hello. I'm Korean Canadian Park Gabi.

348
00:20:44,145 --> 00:20:45,955
(The Universe Ticket teaser to recruit candidates)

349
00:20:45,956 --> 00:20:49,385
I saw Gabi in the teaser.

350
00:20:49,486 --> 00:20:52,526
Everyone saw it, and when I saw it,

351
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:55,555
I thought she was so pretty and cute.

352
00:20:55,655 --> 00:20:57,026
She was...

353
00:20:57,426 --> 00:20:59,166
somewhat extraordinary.

354
00:20:59,595 --> 00:21:01,695
(The 1st meeting of 82 girls)

355
00:21:01,696 --> 00:21:04,466
- She's a model. - She's so pretty.

356
00:21:06,036 --> 00:21:07,405
She's lovely.

357
00:21:07,476 --> 00:21:09,946
- She's like a princess. - She's pretty.

358
00:21:09,976 --> 00:21:12,345
It feels like looking at a celebrity.

359
00:21:12,716 --> 00:21:14,716
She is popular.

360
00:21:14,776 --> 00:21:17,216
And she's got a certain aura.

361
00:21:17,315 --> 00:21:20,216
I wonder how good she is.

362
00:21:21,385 --> 00:21:22,516
I'm curious.

363
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:25,355
I'm excited to see her performance.

364
00:21:26,196 --> 00:21:27,555
What is she performing?

365
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:30,996
("Solo" by Jennie)

366
00:21:51,645 --> 00:21:52,885
She's really good.

367
00:22:07,895 --> 00:22:09,166
She's so good.

368
00:22:20,676 --> 00:22:21,916
Nice

369
00:22:25,085 --> 00:22:26,286
How can she be so stable?

370
00:22:45,706 --> 00:22:47,075
Why is she so good?

371
00:23:00,815 --> 00:23:02,216
Thank you.

372
00:23:04,026 --> 00:23:05,226
What was that?

373
00:23:06,155 --> 00:23:07,655
She's so powerful.

374
00:23:09,496 --> 00:23:10,825
Thank you.

375
00:23:11,325 --> 00:23:12,696
She sings so well.

376
00:23:13,295 --> 00:23:14,395
She's good.

377
00:23:15,236 --> 00:23:17,036
She's got an attractive voice.

378
00:23:17,466 --> 00:23:19,786
When she started rapping, her tone of voice captivated me.

379
00:23:20,036 --> 00:23:21,735
Wasn't she born in 2009?

380
00:23:21,736 --> 00:23:23,176
- Really? - A middle school student.

381
00:23:23,206 --> 00:23:24,345
This is crazy.

382
00:23:24,405 --> 00:23:27,574
Gabi, when you started rapping,

383
00:23:27,575 --> 00:23:29,785
your voice was really attractive.

384
00:23:29,786 --> 00:23:31,644
You've got a fascinating voice.

385
00:23:31,645 --> 00:23:34,455
And you practiced the dance a lot.

386
00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:36,324
The center of gravity was low,

387
00:23:36,325 --> 00:23:38,185
so the dance looked stable.

388
00:23:38,186 --> 00:23:40,426
I want to tell you that you did well.

389
00:23:41,256 --> 00:23:42,496
Thank you.

390
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:44,666
(7th Gabi, 61st Jessica)

391
00:23:45,026 --> 00:23:46,236
To be honest,

392
00:23:46,595 --> 00:23:48,595
she's got a good figure,

393
00:23:48,766 --> 00:23:51,536
so I didn't have much expectation of her.

394
00:23:51,666 --> 00:23:53,475
But her performance was well-balanced.

395
00:23:53,476 --> 00:23:57,176
When she started singing powerfully,

396
00:23:57,605 --> 00:24:00,115
it felt cool and liberating.

397
00:24:00,545 --> 00:24:01,975
I think Gabi is...

398
00:24:01,976 --> 00:24:04,216
the identity of this show.

399
00:24:06,416 --> 00:24:08,486
We're ready for the next battle.

400
00:24:08,756 --> 00:24:10,854
A battle with the 14th, Anxin.

401
00:24:10,855 --> 00:24:12,026
- Anxin. - Anxin.

402
00:24:12,526 --> 00:24:14,825
- I'm so curious about Anxin. - Me too.

403
00:24:14,895 --> 00:24:17,996
What Anxin posted on her social media got ten million views.

404
00:24:19,595 --> 00:24:21,166
Now I'm more excited.

405
00:24:21,295 --> 00:24:22,395
I know.

406
00:24:23,966 --> 00:24:25,505
- Hello. - Anxin.

407
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:27,235
- Anxin. - She's adorable.

408
00:24:27,236 --> 00:24:28,374
Is that a traditional outfit?

409
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:30,375
- That's very unique. - It's unique.

410
00:24:31,075 --> 00:24:32,875
She looks so charming in that outfit.

411
00:24:34,246 --> 00:24:36,486
I was really curious about Anxin.

412
00:24:36,545 --> 00:24:37,686
Anxin.

413
00:24:37,716 --> 00:24:39,246
Your outfit is unique.

414
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:42,285
- Thank you. - She's cute.

415
00:24:42,286 --> 00:24:44,756
This is the traditional outfit of a Chinese ethnic minority.

416
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,425
That's cool.

417
00:24:47,426 --> 00:24:48,496
Beautiful.

418
00:24:48,855 --> 00:24:51,365
- Thank you. - Beautiful.

419
00:24:53,135 --> 00:24:55,135
Hello. I'm Anxin.

420
00:24:55,436 --> 00:24:59,676
I'm from Xishuangbanna, Yunnan, China.

421
00:25:00,006 --> 00:25:01,476
I'm a Hani.

422
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,505
(Anxin's pet elephant, Jinjin)

423
00:25:03,506 --> 00:25:07,874
My home, Xishuangbanna, Yunnan...

424
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:10,216
is a beautiful place.

425
00:25:13,016 --> 00:25:17,625
Anxin, what made you decide to join our show?

426
00:25:19,526 --> 00:25:24,165
(When she was 10)

427
00:25:24,166 --> 00:25:26,835
I started learning dancing when I was seven.

428
00:25:27,335 --> 00:25:32,506
When I dance, I feel like I'm in a different world.

429
00:25:32,736 --> 00:25:36,006
Dance is my everything and my happiness.

430
00:25:37,206 --> 00:25:40,746
I sweat a lot when I dance,

431
00:25:41,016 --> 00:25:44,115
but I feel a great sense of achievement at the same time.

432
00:25:44,486 --> 00:25:47,115
So I don't find it tiring at all.

433
00:25:47,456 --> 00:25:48,736
Because of my passion for dance.

434
00:25:53,526 --> 00:25:56,225
(She posted videos of her dance on social media, )

435
00:25:56,226 --> 00:26:00,935
(and they generated 10 million views across the world.)

436
00:26:00,936 --> 00:26:03,505
I'll work hard...

437
00:26:03,506 --> 00:26:06,165
- to show you good performances. - Good luck.

438
00:26:06,166 --> 00:26:08,375
- I wonder what she's performing. - Good luck.

439
00:26:09,006 --> 00:26:10,875
- She's got a beautiful smile. - I know.

440
00:26:11,446 --> 00:26:12,905
I want her to smile.

441
00:26:13,676 --> 00:26:14,815
I'm excited.

442
00:26:16,246 --> 00:26:21,655
("Flower" by Jisoo)

443
00:26:23,055 --> 00:26:24,125
She's so cute.

444
00:26:24,585 --> 00:26:25,726
She's so cute.

445
00:27:01,726 --> 00:27:04,095
Her fingertips look somewhat sophisticated.

446
00:27:15,276 --> 00:27:16,644
- She's so cute. - How lovely.

447
00:27:16,645 --> 00:27:17,676
She's so skillful.

448
00:27:21,476 --> 00:27:22,476
She's cute.

449
00:27:23,246 --> 00:27:24,385
It suits her well.

450
00:27:35,055 --> 00:27:36,095
She's adorable.

451
00:27:47,905 --> 00:27:49,036
- "Flower." - "Flower."

452
00:27:49,276 --> 00:27:50,276
"Flower."

453
00:27:50,375 --> 00:27:51,604
"Flower."

454
00:27:51,605 --> 00:27:52,605
She was like this.

455
00:27:52,606 --> 00:27:55,075
- It's somewhat captivating. - Thank you.

456
00:27:55,446 --> 00:27:57,114
It feels like the song is...

457
00:27:57,115 --> 00:27:58,435
- for her ethnic group. - I know.

458
00:27:59,085 --> 00:28:01,554
- It sounds like an old song. - Right.

459
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:03,725
Anxin, everything about your performance...

460
00:28:03,726 --> 00:28:07,394
including your fingertips, face, singing, and even outfit...

461
00:28:07,395 --> 00:28:12,165
was perfect for this song as if it was...

462
00:28:12,166 --> 00:28:14,196
- the original performance. - Right.

463
00:28:14,395 --> 00:28:15,865
Thank you.

464
00:28:18,236 --> 00:28:20,235
The winner of this battle is Anxin.

465
00:28:20,236 --> 00:28:21,435
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

466
00:28:21,436 --> 00:28:23,706
(The ethnic minority girl, Anxin won 4 to 1.)

467
00:28:24,345 --> 00:28:26,105
How did they bring people like her?

468
00:28:27,216 --> 00:28:28,775
Where did they find her?

469
00:28:28,776 --> 00:28:30,422
They all have different characters, right?

470
00:28:30,446 --> 00:28:31,686
This is amazing.

471
00:28:32,115 --> 00:28:34,085
We're ready for the next battle.

472
00:28:34,585 --> 00:28:37,305
Let me tell you about this battle using the songs they will perform.

473
00:28:37,456 --> 00:28:39,285
It's a battle between "Pretty Girl" from the Philippines...

474
00:28:39,286 --> 00:28:41,155
and "Queencard" from Japan.

475
00:28:42,696 --> 00:28:44,466
The 22nd Gehlee Dangca...

476
00:28:45,726 --> 00:28:46,996
Gehlee Dangca.

477
00:28:47,496 --> 00:28:48,894
It's a cute name.

478
00:28:48,895 --> 00:28:50,965
Versus the 43rd Jayla.

479
00:28:50,966 --> 00:28:53,175
Jayla. I'm excited.

480
00:28:53,176 --> 00:28:54,656
(22nd Gehlee Danca versus 43rd Jayla)

481
00:28:58,605 --> 00:29:00,246
Hello.

482
00:29:01,545 --> 00:29:02,815
Hello.

483
00:29:05,315 --> 00:29:07,115
She's pretty.

484
00:29:09,855 --> 00:29:12,725
- Jayla is also pretty. - She looks amazing.

485
00:29:12,726 --> 00:29:13,955
She's gorgeous.

486
00:29:13,956 --> 00:29:15,756
Gehlee Dangca is a beauty pageant winner.

487
00:29:23,565 --> 00:29:25,436
- She's pretty. - She's charming.

488
00:29:25,936 --> 00:29:27,036
She's pretty.

489
00:29:27,305 --> 00:29:31,345
Hello, everyone. I'm Gehlee from the Philippines.

490
00:29:32,946 --> 00:29:35,715
(The reason she dreams of becoming a K-pop idol artist)

491
00:29:35,716 --> 00:29:37,516
The Philippines loves K-pop.

492
00:29:37,786 --> 00:29:40,286
Communities are born...

493
00:29:40,916 --> 00:29:43,555
out of idols under K-pop. Like their love for them.

494
00:29:43,855 --> 00:29:45,955
And I think that's pretty beautiful.

495
00:29:45,956 --> 00:29:48,025
And I want to be...

496
00:29:48,026 --> 00:29:50,966
the cause of all the love and connection.

497
00:29:51,795 --> 00:29:54,594
Actually, this came to me as an opportunity.

498
00:29:54,595 --> 00:29:55,765
It was unexpected,

499
00:29:55,766 --> 00:29:58,505
but it will be best if I make the most...

500
00:29:58,506 --> 00:30:01,035
out of everything that comes my way.

501
00:30:01,036 --> 00:30:04,105
Which is why I'm here, and which is why I work so hard...

502
00:30:04,345 --> 00:30:06,375
to fulfill the requirements to be here.

503
00:30:08,045 --> 00:30:09,074
(That's how she came one step closer to her dream.)

504
00:30:09,075 --> 00:30:11,285
- This is it. - My gosh.

505
00:30:11,286 --> 00:30:14,085
- It's right in front of my eyes. - Gosh.

506
00:30:14,216 --> 00:30:16,956
I was so thrilled and glad to be there.

507
00:30:17,186 --> 00:30:18,825
I was really happy.

508
00:30:19,186 --> 00:30:20,625
And you know this?

509
00:30:21,026 --> 00:30:23,155
Korean jelly.

510
00:30:23,895 --> 00:30:25,665
- Jelly. - Like Gehlee Dangca.

511
00:30:25,666 --> 00:30:26,696
(Nice to see you, Jelly.)

512
00:30:26,835 --> 00:30:28,036
Here.

513
00:30:28,295 --> 00:30:30,006
- Thank you. - This is really good.

514
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:35,135
Free...

515
00:30:35,436 --> 00:30:37,145
(Laughing)

516
00:30:37,676 --> 00:30:38,875
Freedom.

517
00:30:39,345 --> 00:30:42,144
(She tries to learn Korean in her spare time.)

518
00:30:42,145 --> 00:30:43,176
What does it say?

519
00:30:43,286 --> 00:30:46,115
What is your favorite Korean food?

520
00:30:48,085 --> 00:30:49,115
Tteokbokki.

521
00:30:49,286 --> 00:30:50,555
- Tteokbokki? - Yes.

522
00:30:53,526 --> 00:30:57,266
(She's not good at using chopsticks, but she loves tteokbokki.)

523
00:30:59,895 --> 00:31:00,895
(Good!)

524
00:31:00,896 --> 00:31:02,835
I've always wanted to go to Korea.

525
00:31:02,936 --> 00:31:04,766
It still doesn't feel real.

526
00:31:05,105 --> 00:31:07,976
Like, "Am I dreaming? It feels like a dream."

527
00:31:09,276 --> 00:31:11,775
This kind of opportunity isn't something...

528
00:31:11,776 --> 00:31:15,375
that you come across on a daily basis.

529
00:31:15,746 --> 00:31:18,446
So I'm just making the most out of this experience.

530
00:31:20,385 --> 00:31:24,425
I think Jayla with all her charm and all her beauty...

531
00:31:24,426 --> 00:31:27,354
is a worthy opponent to compete with.

532
00:31:27,355 --> 00:31:30,195
So I'm the "Pretty Girl" and she's the "Queencard."

533
00:31:30,196 --> 00:31:32,565
And together, we're a perfect match.

534
00:31:34,266 --> 00:31:35,365
Hello.

535
00:31:35,696 --> 00:31:40,375
I'm Japanese American Jayla.

536
00:31:40,776 --> 00:31:44,804
My father is American,

537
00:31:44,805 --> 00:31:47,446
and my mother is Japanese.

538
00:31:48,416 --> 00:31:51,245
(Checking their opponents on the day of the 1-on-1 Battle)

539
00:31:51,246 --> 00:31:54,315
I was glad that Gehlee Dangca chose me.

540
00:31:54,655 --> 00:31:59,655
I believe I'm better when it comes to ability.

541
00:32:00,696 --> 00:32:05,864
My facial expressions and powerful dance moves...

542
00:32:05,865 --> 00:32:08,594
are second to none.

543
00:32:08,595 --> 00:32:11,706
I'm sure I can do better.

544
00:32:12,905 --> 00:32:16,536
We will start with the high rank's performance.

545
00:32:16,645 --> 00:32:18,475
- Good luck. - Good luck.

546
00:32:18,476 --> 00:32:19,676
Good luck.

547
00:32:20,016 --> 00:32:21,345
Go, Pretty Girl!

548
00:32:26,916 --> 00:32:29,286
("Pretty Girl" by KARA)

549
00:32:30,986 --> 00:32:32,085
What's with her voice?

550
00:33:24,305 --> 00:33:25,345
Amazing.

551
00:33:27,075 --> 00:33:28,345
She's so stable.

552
00:33:33,586 --> 00:33:35,316
She's so good.

553
00:33:56,376 --> 00:33:58,546
- She's so pretty. - Yes.

554
00:33:59,546 --> 00:34:01,046
That's the perfect ending.

555
00:34:03,376 --> 00:34:04,385
Thank you.

556
00:34:04,615 --> 00:34:05,686
She's pretty.

557
00:34:05,885 --> 00:34:08,785
- She's so charming. - Thank you.

558
00:34:08,786 --> 00:34:10,585
This is a different kind of charm.

559
00:34:10,586 --> 00:34:11,586
Thank you.

560
00:34:13,286 --> 00:34:14,525
It's something...

561
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:16,381
- we can't easily see in K-pop. - I know.

562
00:34:16,655 --> 00:34:18,625
She sings live so well.

563
00:34:18,626 --> 00:34:19,765
I know. She's really good.

564
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:20,864
Her voice didn't falter even when she was dancing.

565
00:34:20,865 --> 00:34:22,595
- It didn't falter. - When she was doing this.

566
00:34:22,605 --> 00:34:25,041
We all are mesmerized...

567
00:34:25,066 --> 00:34:27,106
by their new charms.

568
00:34:28,393 --> 00:34:29,432
So are we.

569
00:34:29,433 --> 00:34:31,361
They are so charming.

570
00:34:31,362 --> 00:34:34,172
About Gehlee Dangca.

571
00:34:34,502 --> 00:34:36,902
As a songwriter,

572
00:34:37,243 --> 00:34:41,013
I think she has the voice and nuance that I covet.

573
00:34:41,143 --> 00:34:45,813
So I'd like her to practice hard to be a better singer.

574
00:34:46,612 --> 00:34:50,182
To be honest, I kind of fell for these two.

575
00:34:50,183 --> 00:34:52,752
They have unpredictable charms.

576
00:34:52,922 --> 00:34:56,562
Jayla is like a character from an American teen drama.

577
00:34:56,563 --> 00:34:57,592
Exactly.

578
00:34:57,792 --> 00:35:00,191
Right. She's like the female lead.

579
00:35:00,192 --> 00:35:01,932
As for Gehlee,

580
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,401
she looks like a real-life character...

581
00:35:03,402 --> 00:35:05,932
- from a Disney animation movie. - Totally.

582
00:35:05,933 --> 00:35:07,731
Both of you have such unique charms...

583
00:35:07,732 --> 00:35:10,202
we haven't seen before in the K-pop industry.

584
00:35:10,203 --> 00:35:14,013
So I'm looking forward to your future performances.

585
00:35:14,172 --> 00:35:17,981
For the time being, I won't give you detailed feedback on what to do...

586
00:35:17,982 --> 00:35:19,211
since you already seem to know...

587
00:35:19,212 --> 00:35:21,012
- what your strength is. - Right.

588
00:35:21,013 --> 00:35:24,223
In my opinion, you can develop the strength you have now.

589
00:35:24,283 --> 00:35:25,953
Thank you.

590
00:35:27,623 --> 00:35:30,821
All right. Show us the battle result.

591
00:35:30,822 --> 00:35:33,033
(The result will be revealed.)

592
00:35:34,993 --> 00:35:37,062
Jayla. You're very charming,

593
00:35:37,063 --> 00:35:39,333
but I think I can compete with you.

594
00:35:39,933 --> 00:35:41,973
I think I'm going to win.

595
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,829
Show us the battle result.

596
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:48,071
(The result will be revealed.)

597
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:52,309
Jayla. You're very charming,

598
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:54,441
but I think I can compete with you.

599
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,080
I think I'm going to win.

600
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:00,021
(22nd Gehlee Dangca, 43rd Jayla)

601
00:36:02,551 --> 00:36:05,521
(22nd Gehlee Dangca: 2, 43rd Jayla: 3)

602
00:36:06,321 --> 00:36:09,119
The winner of this battle is Jayla.

603
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,030
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

604
00:36:11,031 --> 00:36:12,260
Thank you.

605
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:13,901
Well,

606
00:36:14,531 --> 00:36:18,199
this might come across as a hard truth.

607
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,139
When I saw you perform, Gehlee,

608
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:22,099
I did think that you showed us a beautiful performance.

609
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,610
But I do believe that you would still be capable of...

610
00:36:24,611 --> 00:36:29,310
looking beautiful even if you stop trying to look pretty on stage.

611
00:36:29,381 --> 00:36:31,349
So I would like to see you perform...

612
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:33,227
without being conscious of your looks on stage.

613
00:36:33,251 --> 00:36:34,321
Okay.

614
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,490
Good job, both of you.

615
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:40,290
- Good job. - Good job.

616
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,461
(The 1-on-1 Battle is over.)

617
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:50,231
(At the dorm after the 1-on-1 Battle)

618
00:36:50,271 --> 00:36:52,730
(Kim Sumin: Victory, Kim Chaewon: Victory, Kim Hyojin: Victory)

619
00:36:52,731 --> 00:36:55,740
Ta-da! All three of us won.

620
00:36:55,870 --> 00:37:00,239
(Jang Sua: Defeat, Cho Minseo: Defeat, Hwang Sieun: Defeat)

621
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,440
We finished the battle.

622
00:37:02,441 --> 00:37:04,809
(Lee Huran: Victory, Elisia: Victory, Gehlee Dangca: Defeat)

623
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:05,881
Ta-da.

624
00:37:06,251 --> 00:37:08,120
- I won. - I won.

625
00:37:08,321 --> 00:37:09,520
I want you, babe

626
00:37:09,521 --> 00:37:10,591
I want you

627
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:13,220
I'm so tired.

628
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,421
(Glancing)

629
00:37:17,191 --> 00:37:20,961
I had a realization because... "Oh, true."

630
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:25,370
Because I didn't even think of that before they mentioned it,

631
00:37:26,001 --> 00:37:27,941
but it won't happen again.

632
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,611
Gosh, it's so exhausting.

633
00:37:31,341 --> 00:37:32,341
Why?

634
00:37:32,711 --> 00:37:34,510
Of course, this is exhausting.

635
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:38,651
Because I had to focus on singing and dancing at the same time,

636
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:40,881
I didn't perform well.

637
00:37:41,151 --> 00:37:43,521
To be honest, I was really envious of the winners.

638
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,489
I mean, she's so young. How can she be that good?

639
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:49,390
Right. You went up against her.

640
00:37:50,531 --> 00:37:54,531
(Kim Sujin showcased impressive skills.)

641
00:37:57,531 --> 00:38:02,271
(Bae Haram put on a powerful performance.)

642
00:38:06,281 --> 00:38:10,111
(Bae Haram lost only by 1 vote.)

643
00:38:10,881 --> 00:38:12,111
That's a bummer.

644
00:38:12,481 --> 00:38:14,921
Can we use this?

645
00:38:15,421 --> 00:38:17,251
I could have done better.

646
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:20,421
Come in.

647
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:22,861
- I'm here to get the ramyeon. - Sure.

648
00:38:25,731 --> 00:38:27,430
- Can we come in? - Yes.

649
00:38:28,961 --> 00:38:30,500
- Can we come in? - Yes.

650
00:38:30,501 --> 00:38:31,531
Can I have the ramyeon?

651
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:34,441
- It's here. - The winner!

652
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,341
- Sujin. - Yes?

653
00:38:36,441 --> 00:38:38,771
- Thank you. - We have chopsticks too.

654
00:38:40,881 --> 00:38:42,240
How did you feel then?

655
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,010
Well...

656
00:38:47,321 --> 00:38:49,449
- Should we? - I want to do that.

657
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:53,219
- I knew from the beginning that... - Are you sure you don't have it?

658
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:56,160
Yu was good at singing and dancing.

659
00:38:56,361 --> 00:38:59,631
I did think that I could lose.

660
00:39:07,441 --> 00:39:09,970
It was much more...

661
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,981
It was like... How should I describe this feeling?

662
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:19,111
To be honest, I was disappointed in myself.

663
00:39:20,321 --> 00:39:22,620
(I was upset.)

664
00:39:23,821 --> 00:39:25,650
(As they face complex emotions, )

665
00:39:25,651 --> 00:39:28,120
(the morning breaks the next day.)

666
00:39:30,591 --> 00:39:31,731
Yes.

667
00:39:33,961 --> 00:39:35,361
What's this?

668
00:39:36,501 --> 00:39:41,740
(Uniforms are delivered to the contestants on Day 3.)

669
00:39:42,501 --> 00:39:43,771
I got the uniform.

670
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:45,770
The girls I'm sharing the room with...

671
00:39:45,771 --> 00:39:48,910
got the green uniforms.

672
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:51,650
I was confused. I didn't know why the colors were different.

673
00:39:51,651 --> 00:39:54,921
(Kotoko: Defeat, Yukino: Defeat, Oh Daeun: Victory)

674
00:39:55,151 --> 00:39:56,989
I realized that the colors of our uniforms were assigned...

675
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:59,450
based on the battle result from yesterday.

676
00:39:59,691 --> 00:40:01,159
How come mine is green?

677
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,690
How come mine is pink?

678
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:04,191
I see. Because I have a low rank.

679
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:05,390
What do you mean?

680
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:08,231
I have a low rank. And I also lost.

681
00:40:12,031 --> 00:40:14,300
Do you know why only my uniform is green?

682
00:40:14,301 --> 00:40:15,440
- Why? - Why?

683
00:40:15,441 --> 00:40:17,740
I have a low rank and lost too. So it's green.

684
00:40:18,071 --> 00:40:19,071
Why?

685
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:21,710
I have a low rank. And I also lost.

686
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:22,941
I see.

687
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:24,849
Why are they discriminating against us...

688
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:26,421
- like this? - No. It's okay.

689
00:40:27,051 --> 00:40:28,880
To whom does this pink uniform belong?

690
00:40:28,881 --> 00:40:30,751
- Yours. - It's yours.

691
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:32,551
It's for the winner.

692
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,230
I was reminded that I had lost the battle.

693
00:40:38,231 --> 00:40:39,960
I thought, "I should be wearing that pink uniform."

694
00:40:39,961 --> 00:40:43,199
This competitive side of me took over.

695
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,969
I rarely wear pink outfits.

696
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:46,810
- I really don't wear pink. - But I like pink.

697
00:40:47,171 --> 00:40:48,270
It looks good on you.

698
00:40:48,271 --> 00:40:53,080
When I wore the pink uniform, I felt like I was a princess.

699
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:55,809
"Nice. I'm wearing a pretty color, pink, today again."

700
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:57,850
I realized that it was the uniform for the winners.

701
00:40:58,111 --> 00:40:59,111
Pink.

702
00:41:00,521 --> 00:41:02,880
I had been wearing only pink outfits.

703
00:41:02,881 --> 00:41:04,761
Actually, wearing a green uniform works better.

704
00:41:09,021 --> 00:41:12,159
I chose to go up against her.

705
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,600
But I lost. So that hurt my pride.

706
00:41:14,801 --> 00:41:17,270
I thought I had to get my revenge no matter what.

707
00:41:17,271 --> 00:41:18,631
("I have to get my revenge.")

708
00:41:19,231 --> 00:41:20,900
- Hello. - Hello.

709
00:41:20,901 --> 00:41:22,140
- Hello. - Great.

710
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:23,671
Green uniforms don't look good.

711
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:24,810
Gosh.

712
00:41:24,811 --> 00:41:26,616
(The battle results are clear based on the colors.)

713
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,780
(The winners are wearing the lovely pink uniforms.)

714
00:41:27,781 --> 00:41:29,341
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

715
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:31,280
We look so sad.

716
00:41:31,281 --> 00:41:34,251
- The atmosphere... - Yes. It's very different.

717
00:41:34,521 --> 00:41:35,849
We got our initial ranks...

718
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:37,489
- based on our pictures. - Right.

719
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:39,289
But now, this feels like I got placed in a low rank...

720
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:41,320
- Is it based on our skills? - based on my skills.

721
00:41:41,321 --> 00:41:43,231
- It's hurting my pride more. - Right.

722
00:41:43,531 --> 00:41:46,330
People in pink are glowing with their smiles.

723
00:41:46,531 --> 00:41:48,829
- I love pink. - Yes.

724
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:52,200
- I love pink. - Me too.

725
00:41:52,271 --> 00:41:54,039
I'm really curious about that.

726
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,571
- The benefit? Right. - Yes.

727
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:56,771
I'm so curious.

728
00:41:57,711 --> 00:42:01,409
When I saw it, all of my roommates looked like Barbies.

729
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:03,250
And then I looked in the mirror. I looked like...

730
00:42:03,251 --> 00:42:05,180
a character from "Squid Game."

731
00:42:09,921 --> 00:42:13,220
Everyone, it's Day Three of the Battle Week.

732
00:42:18,591 --> 00:42:21,361
It's already Day Three. We're at the halfway point.

733
00:42:21,801 --> 00:42:23,330
Time flies.

734
00:42:24,231 --> 00:42:28,171
We will now reveal the final battle of the Battle Week.

735
00:42:29,401 --> 00:42:33,281
(Only 41 contestants will survive after the last battle.)

736
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,240
The final battle is...

737
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:38,381
the Revenge Battle.

738
00:42:40,021 --> 00:42:41,521
The Revenge Battle?

739
00:42:42,651 --> 00:42:43,920
"Revenge?"

740
00:42:43,921 --> 00:42:46,191
- Revenge? - Revenge?

741
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:48,119
- Revenge? - Revenge.

742
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,321
(Enthusiastic)

743
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:51,960
The Revenge Battle will be a team battle.

744
00:42:51,961 --> 00:42:53,929
The winners of the 1-on-1 Battle,

745
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:57,969
the Winners, and the losers, the Challengers will battle it out.

746
00:42:57,970 --> 00:43:00,970
- Okay. Challengers. - Gosh.

747
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:04,810
- Wait. - That makes sense. A revenge match.

748
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,540
Hold on. I'm so excited.

749
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,211
This is it.

750
00:43:11,051 --> 00:43:12,450
Let me take our revenge.

751
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:15,450
The fact that I had a chance to get my revenge...

752
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:18,120
motivated me with a bigger sense of passion.

753
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:20,191
They'll take revenge on us?

754
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,430
This sounds fun!

755
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:25,780
No. They have a lot of talented people too.

756
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:27,361
- Oh, my gosh. - Oh, my gosh.

757
00:43:27,901 --> 00:43:29,560
I didn't see that coming.

758
00:43:30,401 --> 00:43:33,870
I'm well aware that the Challengers will be eager...

759
00:43:34,341 --> 00:43:36,200
to take their revenge.

760
00:43:36,341 --> 00:43:39,370
So it made me think that we ought to prepare with more determination.

761
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:43,610
We will now announce how you will break into teams.

762
00:43:43,611 --> 00:43:44,651
I'm curious.

763
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:47,150
Once the Winners make their decisions and form teams,

764
00:43:47,151 --> 00:43:50,890
the Challengers who lost to them will become a team by default.

765
00:43:51,551 --> 00:43:54,090
- Wait. What does that mean? - What?

766
00:43:54,091 --> 00:43:55,789
If we decide to become a team,

767
00:43:55,790 --> 00:43:59,160
the people we beat will be a team too.

768
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:02,700
I guess we don't have a choice in forming our own team.

769
00:44:03,571 --> 00:44:05,300
- This is... - What is this?

770
00:44:05,301 --> 00:44:08,071
- Will we be able to take revenge? - Is it possible?

771
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:11,740
I had no idea that the connection would last this long.

772
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:14,540
- They're choosing it for us. - We don't have any options.

773
00:44:14,881 --> 00:44:16,111
Things are so tough for us.

774
00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:21,021
People with similar styles should team up.

775
00:44:21,521 --> 00:44:23,450
I was worried about that the most.

776
00:44:23,821 --> 00:44:28,390
This is how Xiaoyu must have felt when I picked her on Day One.

777
00:44:28,861 --> 00:44:32,260
I thought this was Xiaoyu's turn to do the same.

778
00:44:36,631 --> 00:44:40,001
There's a total of five concepts for the Revenge Battle.

779
00:44:40,271 --> 00:44:41,271
Five?

780
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:42,841
Five?

781
00:44:43,071 --> 00:44:45,470
We will now reveal the concepts.

782
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:49,980
(What are the 5 concepts that will change the girls' fate?)

783
00:44:49,981 --> 00:44:52,281
- Gosh. - Drumroll.

784
00:44:52,651 --> 00:44:54,119
(Sparkling)

785
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,381
- "Sparkling." - "Sparkling?"

786
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,051
- "Sparkling." - "Sparkling?"

787
00:44:57,790 --> 00:44:58,921
"Sparkling?"

788
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:01,021
- "Sparkling?" - You're totally sparkling.

789
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,990
- I like it. - I like it.

790
00:45:04,591 --> 00:45:05,760
Sparkle.

791
00:45:07,131 --> 00:45:09,531
(What's the second concept?)

792
00:45:10,370 --> 00:45:12,470
- "Pure." - Gosh.

793
00:45:12,970 --> 00:45:14,099
"Pure."

794
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:15,340
That's me.

795
00:45:15,341 --> 00:45:16,370
Me too!

796
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:22,040
I thought I had found an image I could depict well.

797
00:45:22,211 --> 00:45:24,151
I'm not pure at all.

798
00:45:24,651 --> 00:45:27,119
A lot of pretty girls will go for that.

799
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,120
Let's see.

800
00:45:28,121 --> 00:45:30,289
- "Cute." - "Cute."

801
00:45:30,290 --> 00:45:31,421
"Cute."

802
00:45:32,251 --> 00:45:33,691
"Cute."

803
00:45:33,921 --> 00:45:35,390
I want to do all of them.

804
00:45:36,490 --> 00:45:39,260
(The two girls are happy with the Cute concept.)

805
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:42,231
- There are so many young girls. - Right.

806
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:44,369
I don't think all three concepts suit me.

807
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:45,610
Your concept will come out now.

808
00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:47,441
Charismatic.

809
00:45:47,501 --> 00:45:48,700
- Charismatic. - But...

810
00:45:49,941 --> 00:45:51,771
- Charismatic. - Gosh.

811
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:54,910
I want to look cool too.

812
00:45:56,711 --> 00:45:57,881
I like Charismatic.

813
00:45:57,910 --> 00:45:59,651
- This is the last one. - The last one.

814
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:01,981
- "Enchanting." - "Enchanting."

815
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:03,920
- Right. Enchanting. - Gehlee will be great for that.

816
00:46:03,921 --> 00:46:05,521
- Seriously. - Right. Totally.

817
00:46:06,191 --> 00:46:07,921
- Be enchanting. - Be enchanting.

818
00:46:08,490 --> 00:46:09,619
Which one should I do?

819
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:11,020
(This is the charm of the Winners.)

820
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:14,401
(All five concepts are revealed.)

821
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,271
There are two battle songs for each concept.

822
00:46:17,671 --> 00:46:19,369
I see. We get different songs.

823
00:46:19,370 --> 00:46:20,400
However,

824
00:46:20,401 --> 00:46:21,469
the Winners have a benefit...

825
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:24,040
which they won from the 1-on-1 Battles.

826
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:25,539
No.

827
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:26,981
This doesn't count as a benefit?

828
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:28,980
The benefit is...

829
00:46:28,981 --> 00:46:31,910
(What's the benefit that will help the Winners survive?)

830
00:46:32,381 --> 00:46:33,449
the privilege to choose the song.

831
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:35,250
(They can choose the concept with this privilege.)

832
00:46:35,251 --> 00:46:37,020
The Winners can choose the concept...

833
00:46:37,021 --> 00:46:38,751
- and the song they want. - I knew it.

834
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,390
We're the Winners.

835
00:46:41,691 --> 00:46:43,760
I thought, "This will be another easy win."

836
00:46:43,861 --> 00:46:45,389
Since I get to choose the song,

837
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:47,501
I'm confident that I will win no matter what.

838
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:49,430
So do your best.

839
00:46:50,401 --> 00:46:51,470
I'm confident.

840
00:46:51,830 --> 00:46:54,040
You can't beat me in this battle.

841
00:46:55,970 --> 00:46:57,111
Oh, no.

842
00:46:59,410 --> 00:47:01,650
Then I'll end up with an intense concept no matter what.

843
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:03,781
I think I'll end up with Cute.

844
00:47:04,651 --> 00:47:06,349
I thought people who had different styles...

845
00:47:06,350 --> 00:47:09,521
from their opponents would be in a pickle.

846
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:11,421
Oh, no.

847
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:13,890
Winners, you can go outside now...

848
00:47:14,591 --> 00:47:17,160
to decide on the concepts and the battle songs.

849
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:19,861
Oh, my gosh.

850
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:21,401
I'm so glad we won.

851
00:47:24,301 --> 00:47:26,101
Challengers, you will remain in your seats...

852
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:28,571
and wait for the Winners' decisions.

853
00:47:29,171 --> 00:47:30,509
- Yes! - Exit in the same order...

854
00:47:30,510 --> 00:47:31,539
- as you came in. - Let's go.

855
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:33,679
- Let's go! - Slowly walk out in rows of two.

856
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,010
Let's go!

857
00:47:35,941 --> 00:47:37,579
Let's go.

858
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:40,219
It sounds like they only have the privilege to pick the song.

859
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:41,521
But actually,

860
00:47:41,551 --> 00:47:43,551
they get to choose everything.

861
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:45,350
- Right. - How should I put it?

862
00:47:45,591 --> 00:47:47,431
- This is a series of benefits. - It's just...

863
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:50,289
I did think the benefit would be pretty big.

864
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:52,590
But I had no idea that it would be this advantageous.

865
00:47:52,591 --> 00:47:54,930
When that crossed my mind,

866
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:58,631
a sense of crisis permeated through the air...

867
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:01,071
around me.

868
00:48:01,801 --> 00:48:03,870
I was annoyed at first.

869
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:06,810
I had a feeling Yeojin would pick Cute.

870
00:48:06,981 --> 00:48:11,150
(Yeojin put on a cheerful performance during the battle.)

871
00:48:11,151 --> 00:48:13,071
That was the concept I wanted to avoid the most.

872
00:48:13,651 --> 00:48:17,591
I was really shocked that I couldn't pick my own concept.

873
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:22,120
Then Charismatic would suit my opponent.

874
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:24,531
But the song I wanted to avoid was for Charismatic.

875
00:48:24,591 --> 00:48:28,301
If she were to pick a song that was advantageous to her,

876
00:48:28,401 --> 00:48:29,699
I would be doing a performance...

877
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:32,630
that was the opposite of what I wanted.

878
00:48:32,631 --> 00:48:34,401
So I was very concerned.

879
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,010
But we can still beat them.

880
00:48:37,711 --> 00:48:40,341
Let's win this one. We should wear pink next time.

881
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:41,580
- Yes. - Yes.

882
00:48:41,841 --> 00:48:44,210
This is way too cruel.

883
00:48:44,211 --> 00:48:45,457
(Their fate rests on the Winners' decisions.)

884
00:48:45,481 --> 00:48:49,119
We will begin with the first concept.

885
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:51,289
(Feeling great)

886
00:48:51,290 --> 00:48:53,219
I'm so excited.

887
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:54,260
(Feeling great)

888
00:48:55,091 --> 00:48:56,091
Go!

889
00:48:56,092 --> 00:48:58,329
(They will play a game to win the concept and song they want.)

890
00:48:58,330 --> 00:48:59,631
- Don't get hurt! - No!

891
00:48:59,691 --> 00:49:01,411
- Shouldn't we decide by majority? - Right.

892
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:03,500
The Winners have divided into teams...

893
00:49:03,501 --> 00:49:05,600
- and chosen their songs as well. - Good work.

894
00:49:06,731 --> 00:49:09,100
No. I can't end up with Cute.

895
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:14,009
Waiting for the decision in my seat...

896
00:49:14,010 --> 00:49:15,781
was upsetting.

897
00:49:16,781 --> 00:49:18,211
That's when I thought...

898
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,751
I ought to give it my all.

899
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:24,520
Everyone.

900
00:49:24,521 --> 00:49:25,619
- Yes. - Yes.

901
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:28,760
The first team of the Winners has been decided.

902
00:49:31,961 --> 00:49:35,800
Based on the first team of the Winners,

903
00:49:35,801 --> 00:49:40,970
a team of Challengers was formed by default. I'll now announce them.

904
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:43,100
- Oh, my. - Gosh.

905
00:49:43,611 --> 00:49:45,941
- What's the concept? - I'm so nervous.

906
00:49:46,941 --> 00:49:48,239
Jin Hyeonju.

907
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,639
(Jin Hyeonju will be in the first team of the Challengers.)

908
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:51,080
Jin Hyeonju.

909
00:49:53,781 --> 00:49:54,981
Which concept did they choose?

910
00:49:55,021 --> 00:49:56,481
- Kim Chaea. - Yes?

911
00:49:57,191 --> 00:49:58,321
Who did you go up against?

912
00:49:59,350 --> 00:50:00,961
- Is it Cute? - What?

913
00:50:01,461 --> 00:50:03,119
- I think it's Cute. - Oh, no.

914
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:04,260
No!

915
00:50:04,531 --> 00:50:06,067
- Her opponent was cute. - I don't want Cute.

916
00:50:06,091 --> 00:50:07,160
Izumi.

917
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:08,531
- Izumi. - Izumi.

918
00:50:08,631 --> 00:50:10,301
- Cho Minseo. - Okay.

919
00:50:10,401 --> 00:50:12,230
- It must be Cute. - Wait.

920
00:50:12,231 --> 00:50:13,599
- Who were their opponents? - It must be Cute.

921
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,170
You must think about their opponents...

922
00:50:15,171 --> 00:50:16,491
- from yesterday. - I'm thinking.

923
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:19,111
What were their images like?

924
00:50:19,410 --> 00:50:20,610
Lee Suan.

925
00:50:20,611 --> 00:50:22,491
(Lee Suan is the 5th one to join the 1st team.)

926
00:50:23,711 --> 00:50:25,310
It can't be. No.

927
00:50:25,551 --> 00:50:26,579
Pia.

928
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:28,150
(Pia is the 6th one to join the 1st team.)

929
00:50:28,151 --> 00:50:29,449
- What's going on? - I can't picture the team.

930
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:30,450
Wait.

931
00:50:30,451 --> 00:50:32,397
- They're all mixed up. - What kind of combination is this?

932
00:50:32,421 --> 00:50:33,790
- This is nice. - Gehlee Dangca.

933
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:35,719
- What? - What kind of combination is this?

934
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:36,920
- What's this? - I don't know.

935
00:50:36,961 --> 00:50:39,030
- I really have no idea. - I don't know.

936
00:50:39,031 --> 00:50:40,289
(They can't picture the concept for this team.)

937
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:41,330
What's going on?

938
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:43,600
Is it Sparkling?

939
00:50:44,571 --> 00:50:47,199
- Enchanting? - Enchanting?

940
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,770
- No. - Lastly...

941
00:50:48,771 --> 00:50:50,000
(Who will be the last addition to the first team?)

942
00:50:50,001 --> 00:50:51,340
Lastly...

943
00:50:51,341 --> 00:50:53,341
(Who will be the last addition to the first team?)

944
00:50:57,381 --> 00:50:58,410
Bae Haram.

945
00:50:58,981 --> 00:50:59,981
- What? - What kind of combination is this?

946
00:50:59,982 --> 00:51:01,380
- I have no idea. - What?

947
00:51:01,381 --> 00:51:02,850
What kind of combination is this?

948
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:06,020
Gosh. What are you doing, Yeojin?

949
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:07,461
- What did you pick? - Seriously.

950
00:51:07,490 --> 00:51:09,060
Seriously. They're all mixed up.

951
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:12,460
The eight of you are a team now.

952
00:51:12,461 --> 00:51:13,530
(The teams continue to form based on the Winners' decisions.)

953
00:51:13,531 --> 00:51:15,131
The second team has been formed.

954
00:51:15,461 --> 00:51:18,700
- Oh, my. Where's my team? - Goodness.

955
00:51:19,901 --> 00:51:22,340
I didn't know which song my opponent would choose.

956
00:51:22,341 --> 00:51:24,310
I was in the dark about her decisions.

957
00:51:24,341 --> 00:51:25,970
I was very concerned.

958
00:51:26,910 --> 00:51:27,941
What could it be?

959
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:30,611
My pride was bruised.

960
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:33,349
That made me more competitive.

961
00:51:33,350 --> 00:51:34,751
(That made me more competitive.)

962
00:51:35,151 --> 00:51:38,120
(And 3 days later...)

963
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:47,131
(D-day of the Revenge Battle)

964
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,231
That's right, tell me

965
00:51:49,501 --> 00:51:51,900
That's right, tell me

966
00:51:51,901 --> 00:51:53,230
(The Winners enter.)

967
00:51:53,231 --> 00:51:55,300
Hello.

968
00:51:55,301 --> 00:51:56,869
(The Winners enter.)

969
00:51:56,870 --> 00:51:58,171
This is amazing.

970
00:52:00,010 --> 00:52:05,910
(The Challengers enter.)

971
00:52:06,551 --> 00:52:08,351
- We're facing them. - It's Team Challengers.

972
00:52:09,751 --> 00:52:10,949
We're on the right...

973
00:52:10,950 --> 00:52:12,090
- because we're the Challengers. - Yes.

974
00:52:12,091 --> 00:52:13,389
From now on,

975
00:52:13,390 --> 00:52:14,460
if you end up with a low rank,

976
00:52:14,461 --> 00:52:16,101
you won't go there. You'll be eliminated.

977
00:52:16,861 --> 00:52:18,030
I'm suddenly getting nervous.

978
00:52:18,031 --> 00:52:19,671
We'll advance to the next round together.

979
00:52:20,731 --> 00:52:23,100
Actually, I wasn't worried.

980
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,571
I was very confident.

981
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,600
I'll win no matter what.

982
00:52:27,071 --> 00:52:30,441
I now have a chance to take my revenge.

983
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:33,071
I have to win this time no matter what.

984
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:35,781
I'll make them understand the meaning of revenge.

985
00:52:37,481 --> 00:52:38,679
Hello.

986
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:40,520
(The 5 Unicorns of Universe Ticket enter.)

987
00:52:40,521 --> 00:52:41,850
Hello.

988
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:44,720
- Hello. - Hello.

989
00:52:53,091 --> 00:52:55,130
I guess their dress code for today is black.

990
00:52:55,131 --> 00:52:57,531
Everyone is dressed in black and chic outfits.

991
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:58,901
They're kind of scaring me.

992
00:53:00,771 --> 00:53:02,071
Everyone.

993
00:53:02,341 --> 00:53:05,140
This is the last day of the Battle Week.

994
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:06,941
Are you all ready?

995
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,441
- Yes. - Yes.

996
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:10,079
Are you sure you're really ready?

997
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:11,251
- Yes. - Yes.

998
00:53:11,751 --> 00:53:13,750
From what I heard,

999
00:53:13,751 --> 00:53:15,780
you guys had only three days to practice.

1000
00:53:15,781 --> 00:53:18,021
That's a very short time.

1001
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:20,540
I trust that you thoroughly prepared for the performances.

1002
00:53:20,591 --> 00:53:22,289
So show us your performance with confidence.

1003
00:53:22,290 --> 00:53:23,461
- We can do this. - Okay.

1004
00:53:24,691 --> 00:53:27,130
The Winners...

1005
00:53:27,131 --> 00:53:29,461
seem confident and proud.

1006
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:31,571
But the Challengers are feeling down.

1007
00:53:31,631 --> 00:53:33,300
- I bet they lost confidence. - They're not feeling good.

1008
00:53:33,301 --> 00:53:36,000
But you know that motivates you to work harder, right?

1009
00:53:36,001 --> 00:53:37,271
- Right. - Yes.

1010
00:53:37,671 --> 00:53:41,341
It's after you have shown up

1011
00:53:41,711 --> 00:53:44,211
I desperately want to win. Seriously.

1012
00:53:44,481 --> 00:53:45,721
I'll win today, no matter what.

1013
00:53:46,711 --> 00:53:49,050
All right. This final battle of the Battle Week...

1014
00:53:49,051 --> 00:53:51,651
will decide the 41 girls that will move on to the Universe.

1015
00:53:51,751 --> 00:53:54,521
I will go over the rules for the Revenge Battle.

1016
00:53:54,790 --> 00:53:55,989
Oh, my gosh.

1017
00:53:55,990 --> 00:53:59,260
(The rules for the Revenge Battle will be revealed now.)

1018
00:53:59,461 --> 00:54:01,000
(Pure)

1019
00:54:01,001 --> 00:54:04,170
In the Revenge Battle, the Winners and Challengers...

1020
00:54:04,171 --> 00:54:07,801
will compete against each other with 1 concept but 2 songs.

1021
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:11,240
The Unicorns' votes will decide who will win and lose.

1022
00:54:11,941 --> 00:54:13,640
Gosh, this is so hard.

1023
00:54:13,910 --> 00:54:15,341
This is what survival is.

1024
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:18,309
Through this stage, the winning team...

1025
00:54:18,310 --> 00:54:20,751
will advance to the Universe.

1026
00:54:21,881 --> 00:54:24,389
However, the number of participants...

1027
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:26,551
who can advance to the Universe with our votes...

1028
00:54:29,021 --> 00:54:31,090
is half of the winning team.

1029
00:54:31,091 --> 00:54:34,760
(Half of the winning team)

1030
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:40,071
(Only 20 out of the 41 winners can advance today.)

1031
00:54:40,941 --> 00:54:42,171
- Four? - Half?

1032
00:54:42,301 --> 00:54:43,841
- That's so little. - Right?

1033
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:45,810
What about the other half?

1034
00:54:46,571 --> 00:54:49,711
Only 20 will be selected.

1035
00:54:50,310 --> 00:54:51,580
This is bad.

1036
00:54:53,810 --> 00:54:55,619
The remaining winning and losing teams...

1037
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:57,691
who don't get picked by the Unicorns...

1038
00:54:58,021 --> 00:55:01,159
will get the chance to advance to the Universe...

1039
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:03,719
with Fan Ticketing, the global fan votes.

1040
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,429
(The rest will be selected by the Global Fan Ticketing.)

1041
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:08,231
We'll get another chance even if we don't get selected today.

1042
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:10,560
We do get another chance. But...

1043
00:55:11,131 --> 00:55:13,070
Only the popular participants will survive.

1044
00:55:13,071 --> 00:55:14,100
I know, right?

1045
00:55:14,341 --> 00:55:17,000
If you lose and you're unpopular, you'll get eliminated.

1046
00:55:17,001 --> 00:55:18,470
I ranked 71st.

1047
00:55:19,271 --> 00:55:20,941
We have to win no matter what.

1048
00:55:24,810 --> 00:55:27,280
It's okay. We will win.

1049
00:55:27,281 --> 00:55:28,551
- Yes. - Great.

1050
00:55:29,421 --> 00:55:32,821
Revenge Battle that will decide who will advance to the Universe.

1051
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:35,660
Shall we start now?

1052
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,220
- Yes! - Yes!

1053
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:40,760
(Battle Week's final Revenge Battle)

1054
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:44,631
I'm getting nervous again. Never mind.

1055
00:55:45,671 --> 00:55:47,071
I'm excited for this group battle.

1056
00:55:47,301 --> 00:55:48,470
- The group battle? - Yes.

1057
00:55:48,801 --> 00:55:50,870
Who decides the parts? The participants?

1058
00:55:50,970 --> 00:55:54,509
Things change according to how many parts you get.

1059
00:55:54,510 --> 00:55:55,711
- I know, right? - Yes.

1060
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:59,210
But some pull off the little parts they get really well.

1061
00:55:59,211 --> 00:56:01,281
Yes. There are those who just shine.

1062
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:05,150
Cute Winners and Challengers,

1063
00:56:05,151 --> 00:56:06,691
please come onto the stage.

1064
00:56:10,890 --> 00:56:12,060
- How adorable. - Gosh.

1065
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:15,360
Hello.

1066
00:56:15,361 --> 00:56:18,401
- Hello. - Hello.

1067
00:56:18,771 --> 00:56:23,071
- Hello. - Hello.

1068
00:56:23,870 --> 00:56:25,009
They look pretty.

1069
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:26,711
They're all so cute.

1070
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:30,340
That team has Gabi.

1071
00:56:30,341 --> 00:56:32,180
Yes. They even have Seowon.

1072
00:56:33,551 --> 00:56:36,349
Challengers, you didn't get to choose the song.

1073
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:37,720
How did you feel?

1074
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:45,159
(The Challengers are waiting for the concept and song.)

1075
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:49,830
Who was your 1-on-1 Battle opponent?

1076
00:56:51,301 --> 00:56:52,301
Gabi.

1077
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:56,671
(Gabi showed a surprising charm with her powerful rap.)

1078
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,771
- Yes. - I see.

1079
00:56:59,341 --> 00:57:00,370
Lim Seowon.

1080
00:57:02,611 --> 00:57:06,481
(Lim Seowon made a clean sweep with her solid vocals.)

1081
00:57:07,281 --> 00:57:08,281
Lim Seowon.

1082
00:57:08,282 --> 00:57:09,350
- Oh, my gosh. - Yes.

1083
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:10,950
- Yes. - Oh, my gosh.

1084
00:57:12,091 --> 00:57:13,750
At this rate,

1085
00:57:13,751 --> 00:57:18,091
all of our opponents will be really skilled.

1086
00:57:18,890 --> 00:57:20,760
The other team is too strong.

1087
00:57:21,301 --> 00:57:25,001
I can't help but think we're at a disadvantage.

1088
00:57:25,171 --> 00:57:29,470
I'm worried because our opponent is really powerful.

1089
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:33,139
- We're going to the practice room. - I'm hungry.

1090
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:34,309
(Winners are happy after the concept and song selection.)

1091
00:57:34,310 --> 00:57:35,579
Can we meet the other team?

1092
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:37,680
We can finally meet our opponent team.

1093
00:57:38,310 --> 00:57:39,410
I'm really excited.

1094
00:57:39,981 --> 00:57:41,481
I don't have a clue.

1095
00:57:41,781 --> 00:57:43,619
- We are... - Hi.

1096
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:45,619
- Hi. - Hi.

1097
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:46,921
You're here?

1098
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:49,360
- Which song are we doing? - Hi.

1099
00:57:49,361 --> 00:57:50,361
Hi.

1100
00:57:50,362 --> 00:57:52,060
- The song... - Are we a team?

1101
00:57:52,191 --> 00:57:53,691
- Hi. - Hi.

1102
00:57:53,861 --> 00:57:55,430
- We look quite cool. - We...

1103
00:57:55,731 --> 00:57:58,070
- Stand over there. - Be with your team.

1104
00:57:58,071 --> 00:57:59,429
- We'll stand here. - Keep an eye on them.

1105
00:57:59,430 --> 00:58:00,530
(The Challengers are on guard.)

1106
00:58:00,531 --> 00:58:02,200
What do you think our concept is?

1107
00:58:03,470 --> 00:58:04,711
Do we not look cool?

1108
00:58:05,071 --> 00:58:06,539
- I see. - How did you know?

1109
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:07,739
- Our charisma. - Where?

1110
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:11,580
I only see cute kids here.

1111
00:58:12,010 --> 00:58:14,521
- What is it? - What is it?

1112
00:58:15,021 --> 00:58:16,321
It's Cute.

1113
00:58:16,950 --> 00:58:18,321
It's Cute.

1114
00:58:18,890 --> 00:58:20,220
- Gosh. - My gosh.

1115
00:58:20,390 --> 00:58:21,590
- It's not bad. - We can do it.

1116
00:58:21,591 --> 00:58:22,791
- We can pull it off. - Right?

1117
00:58:22,921 --> 00:58:24,489
- We're cute. - Yes.

1118
00:58:24,490 --> 00:58:25,559
- We're so cute. - We...

1119
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:27,230
- Open it. - Open it.

1120
00:58:27,231 --> 00:58:28,830
- You open it. - Me?

1121
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:31,970
- One, two, three. - Two, three.

1122
00:58:32,131 --> 00:58:33,170
Ta-da!

1123
00:58:33,171 --> 00:58:34,341
("Tell Me" by Wonder Girls)

1124
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:38,210
(In 2007, "Tell Me" by Wonder Girls...)

1125
00:58:38,211 --> 00:58:40,881
(and their signature line, "Oh, my" became a big hit in Korea.)

1126
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:44,850
As you know, we are quite cute.

1127
00:58:44,981 --> 00:58:46,949
- We're the cuter "TT." - We have Seowon.

1128
00:58:46,950 --> 00:58:48,550
- Can you beat Seowon's cuteness? - No.

1129
00:58:48,551 --> 00:58:49,820
(Team Cute's Battle Songs:)

1130
00:58:49,821 --> 00:58:51,150
("Tell Me" by Wonder Girls versus "TT" by TWICE)

1131
00:58:51,151 --> 00:58:53,271
- Try to get your revenge. - Try to get your revenge.

1132
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:54,620
I'm ignoring that.

1133
00:58:56,260 --> 00:58:57,260
Good job.

1134
00:58:57,261 --> 00:58:59,231
- Good job. - That was great.

1135
00:58:59,790 --> 00:59:01,060
They're not easy.

1136
00:59:01,361 --> 00:59:04,100
I wasn't worried or anything.

1137
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:06,970
I'm sorry, but I've got to win.

1138
00:59:08,301 --> 00:59:09,671
I will win, period.

1139
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:15,910
It's a team with amazing participants.

1140
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:18,751
I will win again this time.

1141
00:59:20,010 --> 00:59:21,619
- Who do we pick? - First, the leader.

1142
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:22,620
Okay, the leader.

1143
00:59:22,621 --> 00:59:23,650
(Cute Winners start with full motivation.)

1144
00:59:23,651 --> 00:59:25,950
- One, two, three. - Two, three.

1145
00:59:27,390 --> 00:59:28,421
I knew it.

1146
00:59:28,790 --> 00:59:30,860
- The eldest should do it. - It's me in the end.

1147
00:59:30,861 --> 00:59:32,090
(Cute Winner's eldest, Oh Daeun, is the leader!)

1148
00:59:32,091 --> 00:59:33,130
Okay.

1149
00:59:33,131 --> 00:59:34,730
Then I'll be a good leader...

1150
00:59:34,731 --> 00:59:36,630
- and make us win again. - Okay.

1151
00:59:36,631 --> 00:59:38,300
- Great. - We can do it!

1152
00:59:38,301 --> 00:59:39,531
We can do it!

1153
00:59:40,401 --> 00:59:42,070
Let's memorize the choreography today.

1154
00:59:42,071 --> 00:59:43,071
Okay.

1155
00:59:46,111 --> 00:59:47,139
Well...

1156
00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:50,111
(Meanwhile, Cute Challengers are...)

1157
00:59:51,111 --> 00:59:54,881
Don't worry. We will win the battle, okay?

1158
00:59:55,350 --> 00:59:57,050
(What?)

1159
00:59:57,051 --> 00:59:58,651
Yes, we can do it.

1160
00:59:59,551 --> 01:00:01,320
What I think we should do...

1161
01:00:01,321 --> 01:00:05,560
is choose the main dancer first,

1162
01:00:05,990 --> 01:00:08,260
and then the rest...

1163
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:10,131
Do you understand me?

1164
01:00:11,571 --> 01:00:12,870
I can't understand.

1165
01:00:13,470 --> 01:00:14,571
Our team...

1166
01:00:15,071 --> 01:00:17,470
only has a few Koreans.

1167
01:00:17,810 --> 01:00:20,140
So communication-wise, it's hard.

1168
01:00:20,470 --> 01:00:23,179
There are six foreigners, and that's a lot.

1169
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:25,711
We have Indonesian and Italian.

1170
01:00:25,950 --> 01:00:27,680
It's so hard to communicate.

1171
01:00:28,251 --> 01:00:29,251
Yes.

1172
01:00:29,252 --> 01:00:33,350
Can you show us a bit of your dance moves?

1173
01:00:33,691 --> 01:00:35,691
These two can't understand Korean.

1174
01:00:35,861 --> 01:00:36,921
- Yes. - You're right.

1175
01:00:37,021 --> 01:00:39,930
We will have a vote for you to...

1176
01:00:40,290 --> 01:00:44,531
(Explaining it once in English, then again in Chinese.)

1177
01:00:45,301 --> 01:00:46,630
(Will they be able to start practicing?)

1178
01:00:46,631 --> 01:00:47,640
In English...

1179
01:00:49,841 --> 01:00:52,239
Today was such a tough day.

1180
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:55,380
My team has only two Koreans.

1181
01:00:55,381 --> 01:00:57,510
- I was an interpreter for the day. - Seriously?

1182
01:00:57,711 --> 01:00:59,050
- All day long. - Oh, no.

1183
01:00:59,051 --> 01:01:00,079
And I'm the leader.

1184
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:01,381
- Really? - So...

1185
01:01:01,950 --> 01:01:05,321
Whenever I talk, I need to translate it...

1186
01:01:05,921 --> 01:01:07,220
- into three languages. - I see.

1187
01:01:07,551 --> 01:01:08,789
I need to repeat it three times.

1188
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:10,020
- Chinese... - Chinese, Korean...

1189
01:01:10,021 --> 01:01:11,329
Chinese, Korean, and English.

1190
01:01:11,330 --> 01:01:12,806
(Taking 4 times as long to communicate)

1191
01:01:12,830 --> 01:01:15,200
(2 days before the Revenge Battle)

1192
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:20,200
(Due to the lack of communication, the team can't practice.)

1193
01:01:20,531 --> 01:01:23,500
Our team is a bit behind in progress.

1194
01:01:23,501 --> 01:01:28,880
Some teammates might not have been focusing...

1195
01:01:28,881 --> 01:01:33,781
or were a bit off as a team.

1196
01:01:34,350 --> 01:01:36,021
One, two, again.

1197
01:01:36,321 --> 01:01:37,449
One, two.

1198
01:01:37,450 --> 01:01:39,250
- Again. - Come on, guys.

1199
01:01:39,251 --> 01:01:41,196
- From the beginning. - Again from the beginning.

1200
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:42,290
Four, five, six...

1201
01:01:42,691 --> 01:01:43,860
- Again. - Again.

1202
01:01:43,861 --> 01:01:46,390
Concentrate, guys!

1203
01:01:46,531 --> 01:01:48,900
Okay, I know you just did that, but do it again

1204
01:01:48,901 --> 01:01:50,829
- Okay, that was good. - Our foreign teammate...

1205
01:01:50,830 --> 01:01:53,501
is in charge of the rap part.

1206
01:01:53,571 --> 01:01:57,941
She knows zero Korean.

1207
01:01:58,211 --> 01:01:59,640
Honestly, she does...

1208
01:01:59,771 --> 01:02:02,380
make a few mistakes.

1209
01:02:02,381 --> 01:02:04,239
Okay, I know you just did that, but do it again

1210
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:05,810
Tell me

1211
01:02:06,051 --> 01:02:07,151
Shall we do it again?

1212
01:02:07,981 --> 01:02:09,981
- "Again?" Okay. - We're not used to it yet.

1213
01:02:10,321 --> 01:02:11,321
Again.

1214
01:02:11,521 --> 01:02:12,691
Focus!

1215
01:02:13,091 --> 01:02:14,759
- The next move is... - To be frank,

1216
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:16,521
- going forward. - it is tough.

1217
01:02:16,961 --> 01:02:20,531
But after seeing that everyone from different countries...

1218
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:22,361
was practicing hard...

1219
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:26,100
to become K-pop idols,

1220
01:02:26,171 --> 01:02:28,840
I really wanted to help them a lot.

1221
01:02:28,841 --> 01:02:30,340
Work hard, and we can do it.

1222
01:02:30,341 --> 01:02:31,370
Hey.

1223
01:02:31,970 --> 01:02:35,140
(They speak different languages but have gathered for the same dream.)

1224
01:02:38,111 --> 01:02:39,680
What is it?

1225
01:02:39,850 --> 01:02:40,881
What happened?

1226
01:02:41,251 --> 01:02:42,751
- My eye. - This...

1227
01:02:42,950 --> 01:02:44,650
- Why did this happen? - I don't know.

1228
01:02:44,651 --> 01:02:45,826
- Just all of a sudden? - Yes.

1229
01:02:45,850 --> 01:02:47,720
- It suddenly happened? - Yes, suddenly.

1230
01:02:48,191 --> 01:02:49,321
The hospital.

1231
01:02:49,461 --> 01:02:50,620
- "Hospital?" - Right now?

1232
01:02:50,990 --> 01:02:52,731
- I think it's closed. - Yes.

1233
01:02:52,961 --> 01:02:54,759
But shouldn't she...

1234
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:56,631
at least go to the emergency room?

1235
01:02:56,731 --> 01:02:57,801
What do we do?

1236
01:02:58,571 --> 01:03:00,531
- I'll be back. - Okay.

1237
01:03:02,901 --> 01:03:06,440
(On the day of the Revenge Battle, Yamaguchi Yuriko's spot is empty.)

1238
01:03:06,441 --> 01:03:08,739
- Okay. Let's check the audio. - I was...

1239
01:03:08,740 --> 01:03:11,281
extremely worried.

1240
01:03:11,510 --> 01:03:14,251
On top of that, I got sick.

1241
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:17,051
I wasn't sure if we could win.

1242
01:03:18,051 --> 01:03:20,289
We'll start the stage rehearsal.

1243
01:03:20,290 --> 01:03:22,720
(The rehearsal starts without Yuriko.)

1244
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:34,500
(The 1st rehearsal ends.)

1245
01:03:34,501 --> 01:03:35,501
This...

1246
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:38,309
How do I do this?

1247
01:03:38,310 --> 01:03:40,211
- This? - Yuriko...

1248
01:03:40,941 --> 01:03:42,280
Yuriko's should be on this side.

1249
01:03:42,281 --> 01:03:44,880
Are you okay with the rehearsal, Yuriko?

1250
01:03:44,881 --> 01:03:46,510
- Can you do it? - Yes.

1251
01:03:46,950 --> 01:03:50,580
I was anxious because I had lost my voice.

1252
01:03:50,981 --> 01:03:52,950
But I was determined to give it my all.

1253
01:03:54,191 --> 01:03:56,289
(Cute Challengers are in a crisis.)

1254
01:03:56,290 --> 01:03:59,389
(Will they be able to perform well?)

1255
01:03:59,390 --> 01:04:03,130
- Yamaguchi Yuriko. - Yes.

1256
01:04:03,131 --> 01:04:06,300
I heard that you struggled a lot because you suddenly became sick.

1257
01:04:06,301 --> 01:04:07,370
Yes.

1258
01:04:07,671 --> 01:04:09,100
Are you okay now?

1259
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:13,170
Yesterday, I was very startled.

1260
01:04:13,171 --> 01:04:16,740
But I made a lot of effort because I wanted to take the stage.

1261
01:04:19,211 --> 01:04:21,180
- Stay healthy. - Stay healthy.

1262
01:04:21,251 --> 01:04:22,421
Good luck.

1263
01:04:22,580 --> 01:04:25,121
Let's check out the Challengers' performance.

1264
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:28,191
- Tell me, tell me! - Tell me, tell me!

1265
01:04:29,821 --> 01:04:32,291
- Let's go. - Good luck.

1266
01:04:34,901 --> 01:04:36,361
I hope this team does well.

1267
01:04:37,871 --> 01:04:39,100
I hope they do well.

1268
01:04:39,231 --> 01:04:40,701
Please.

1269
01:04:43,071 --> 01:04:46,411
Firstly, we have cute looks.

1270
01:04:46,911 --> 01:04:49,581
We are charming even when we stand still.

1271
01:04:50,010 --> 01:04:53,350
I hope we will be able to shine on the stage.

1272
01:04:55,581 --> 01:04:56,651
Let's go.

1273
01:04:58,651 --> 01:05:02,191
("Tell Me" by Wonder Girls)

1274
01:05:03,291 --> 01:05:04,291
How cute.

1275
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:10,260
How cute.

1276
01:05:10,531 --> 01:05:11,701
My goodness.

1277
01:05:36,821 --> 01:05:37,861
You are good.

1278
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:21,741
Go, girls!

1279
01:06:57,741 --> 01:06:58,741
How cute.

1280
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:44,550
- They nailed the performance. - How cute.

1281
01:07:46,890 --> 01:07:48,060
My goodness.

1282
01:07:53,161 --> 01:07:56,559
Cute Challengers...

1283
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:57,960
don't have a main dancer.

1284
01:07:59,401 --> 01:08:02,900
Had they practiced the dance harder,

1285
01:08:02,901 --> 01:08:05,611
the performance would have been even better.

1286
01:08:05,970 --> 01:08:08,179
There isn't a main vocalist among them either.

1287
01:08:08,180 --> 01:08:09,310
Really?

1288
01:08:09,941 --> 01:08:11,081
But...

1289
01:08:11,380 --> 01:08:14,879
even if I set those matters aside,

1290
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:17,249
I want to applaud them for one thing.

1291
01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:20,389
In this team, not a single member gave up.

1292
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:22,021
From the beginning to the end,

1293
01:08:22,861 --> 01:08:26,459
everyone said that it would be hard for this team to win.

1294
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:28,129
But they didn't give up until the end.

1295
01:08:28,130 --> 01:08:31,929
No one let her attitude waver.

1296
01:08:31,930 --> 01:08:33,999
"I will show what I practiced."

1297
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,371
I could feel that.

1298
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,410
I really want to give big kudos...

1299
01:08:38,411 --> 01:08:41,840
because those people can't fail as long as they have time.

1300
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:45,780
They had the handicap of the language barrier.

1301
01:08:45,781 --> 01:08:47,450
I want to thank them...

1302
01:08:47,451 --> 01:08:49,980
for doing well until the end without giving up...

1303
01:08:49,981 --> 01:08:51,549
despite the difficult situation.

1304
01:08:51,550 --> 01:08:52,750
Well done.

1305
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:55,590
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1306
01:08:58,991 --> 01:09:01,559
Now comes the team that also prepared a performance...

1307
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:05,170
with the cute concept, Cute Winners.

1308
01:09:05,231 --> 01:09:06,371
Let's go.

1309
01:09:07,531 --> 01:09:10,100
Seowon drives me crazy with her cuteness.

1310
01:09:10,371 --> 01:09:13,170
This team has many members whose cuteness is legendary.

1311
01:09:14,010 --> 01:09:16,481
(They suit the cute concept perfectly.)

1312
01:09:16,911 --> 01:09:20,150
I have a feeling that this team has a different cuteness.

1313
01:09:20,151 --> 01:09:22,081
Can you tell us about your charms?

1314
01:09:22,621 --> 01:09:25,920
Which camera should I look at?

1315
01:09:28,321 --> 01:09:29,560
So cute.

1316
01:09:33,161 --> 01:09:35,259
(Winners' honest and daring type of cuteness)

1317
01:09:35,260 --> 01:09:36,361
How cute.

1318
01:09:37,831 --> 01:09:41,940
You know, all the parts have a cute vibe.

1319
01:09:41,941 --> 01:09:45,809
In my opinion, Part Three is the part that stands out the most.

1320
01:09:45,810 --> 01:09:48,340
- Yes. It's the chorus. - So...

1321
01:09:49,510 --> 01:09:53,281
(Part 3 is a chorus for the main dancer.)

1322
01:09:54,081 --> 01:09:56,151
Who wants to take Part Three?

1323
01:09:56,621 --> 01:09:58,850
Me. Hold on.

1324
01:09:59,250 --> 01:10:00,650
I want to take it.

1325
01:10:00,651 --> 01:10:01,797
(Gabi applies for Part 3 as well.)

1326
01:10:01,821 --> 01:10:03,389
Can you sing it?

1327
01:10:03,390 --> 01:10:04,690
(The team will make a decision after they sing the part.)

1328
01:10:04,691 --> 01:10:07,731
I think I am already a grown-up

1329
01:10:08,331 --> 01:10:10,429
It's my heart

1330
01:10:10,430 --> 01:10:13,500
But I can't tell it what to do

1331
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:18,640
Seowon.

1332
01:10:19,411 --> 01:10:22,310
I think I am already a grown-up

1333
01:10:22,781 --> 01:10:24,709
It's my heart

1334
01:10:24,710 --> 01:10:27,451
But I can't tell it what to do

1335
01:10:30,180 --> 01:10:31,719
I think Seowon did a better job...

1336
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:34,690
- of bringing out the cheerful vibe. - Yes.

1337
01:10:34,691 --> 01:10:37,720
So I want Seowon to take it. What do you think?

1338
01:10:39,291 --> 01:10:40,459
Thank you.

1339
01:10:40,460 --> 01:10:42,401
I really wanted the part,

1340
01:10:42,901 --> 01:10:44,930
but it suited Seowon better.

1341
01:10:45,701 --> 01:10:47,201
So... Yes.

1342
01:10:48,340 --> 01:10:51,270
The fact that I am smaller than other people...

1343
01:10:51,271 --> 01:10:53,139
worries me the most.

1344
01:10:53,140 --> 01:10:55,980
I might be invisible when I dance with the others.

1345
01:10:55,981 --> 01:10:57,580
It worries me.

1346
01:10:57,581 --> 01:10:59,910
- I will sing the chorus. - Stand there.

1347
01:10:59,911 --> 01:11:01,510
Yes. Stand at the center.

1348
01:11:02,021 --> 01:11:05,719
I like that I come forward at the center in Part Three.

1349
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:07,121
I think I chose very well.

1350
01:11:07,321 --> 01:11:09,161
I have been lucky this week.

1351
01:11:11,420 --> 01:11:12,759
I'm like TT

1352
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:13,760
When we sing that line,

1353
01:11:13,930 --> 01:11:15,430
our hands should do this.

1354
01:11:15,861 --> 01:11:17,629
- Isn't it this? - What?

1355
01:11:17,630 --> 01:11:18,969
- Isn't it this? - I think it's this.

1356
01:11:18,970 --> 01:11:19,999
Really?

1357
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,740
Do we move our hands up like this?

1358
01:11:21,741 --> 01:11:24,000
- Really? - Move your hands up and make T.

1359
01:11:24,041 --> 01:11:25,510
Just like TT

1360
01:11:26,170 --> 01:11:27,969
You don't know how I feel

1361
01:11:27,970 --> 01:11:30,040
- The legs... - You don't know how I feel

1362
01:11:30,041 --> 01:11:31,241
Isn't it this?

1363
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:33,879
Shouldn't we figure out the details...

1364
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:36,080
after we proceed with the dance?

1365
01:11:36,081 --> 01:11:38,850
- Then... - Shouldn't the details come first?

1366
01:11:39,151 --> 01:11:40,451
(Unsure)

1367
01:11:40,691 --> 01:11:44,090
Although we were practicing, we didn't come together.

1368
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:46,361
That was a bit hard.

1369
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:48,831
I just hit my innocent plushie

1370
01:11:49,331 --> 01:11:52,730
I felt pressured due to the competition.

1371
01:11:52,731 --> 01:11:54,571
Then the dance...

1372
01:11:56,300 --> 01:11:58,470
I was a bit surprised.

1373
01:11:59,970 --> 01:12:01,240
Well,

1374
01:12:01,241 --> 01:12:03,840
I think we should focus more.

1375
01:12:04,041 --> 01:12:06,411
The practice gave me much to think about.

1376
01:12:07,180 --> 01:12:09,621
- What next? - Let's go slow, Gabi.

1377
01:12:10,180 --> 01:12:11,890
There is a dance that comes in between,

1378
01:12:12,021 --> 01:12:14,049
but we haven't learned it yet.

1379
01:12:14,050 --> 01:12:15,060
Set, go.

1380
01:12:16,220 --> 01:12:18,990
I think I am already a grown-up

1381
01:12:18,991 --> 01:12:21,030
- The formation looks strange. - Okay.

1382
01:12:21,031 --> 01:12:23,161
You shouldn't be hidden.

1383
01:12:23,401 --> 01:12:27,000
When we were unfocused, she organized everything.

1384
01:12:27,371 --> 01:12:29,299
She led us well,

1385
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:33,309
so we could practice in a time-effective manner.

1386
01:12:33,310 --> 01:12:36,209
Go a bit to the side. Go further to the side.

1387
01:12:36,210 --> 01:12:38,510
That's the pose. Gosh, I can't see Seowon.

1388
01:12:41,310 --> 01:12:42,781
Oh, my goodness.

1389
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:47,621
I told you that I was invisible due to my short height!

1390
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:48,790
In that case,

1391
01:12:48,791 --> 01:12:51,521
- you should bend over a lot. - Okay.

1392
01:12:53,361 --> 01:12:55,960
She is so good.

1393
01:12:56,260 --> 01:12:58,799
Like a hawk, she watched us...

1394
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:00,499
and went over each problem.

1395
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:02,169
I am the leader.

1396
01:13:02,170 --> 01:13:04,400
I want to be an older member who is trustworthy.

1397
01:13:04,401 --> 01:13:06,640
I think I am the type to have leadership...

1398
01:13:06,771 --> 01:13:09,111
when I am with younger members.

1399
01:13:09,481 --> 01:13:11,780
How will we change the formation?

1400
01:13:11,781 --> 01:13:14,950
I will do it. I have done it many times.

1401
01:13:14,951 --> 01:13:16,151
Don't worry.

1402
01:13:18,991 --> 01:13:21,889
(Thanks to Daeun's leadership, the team settles down.)

1403
01:13:21,890 --> 01:13:24,420
- Let's do the body roll together. - Okay.

1404
01:13:24,890 --> 01:13:27,930
You need to be a bit sexy in this part.

1405
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:31,161
How cute.

1406
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:34,870
(Cute Winners regained their energy.)

1407
01:13:34,871 --> 01:13:36,170
She is like a baby.

1408
01:13:38,871 --> 01:13:41,340
(With the changed atmosphere, they pick up the speed.)

1409
01:13:43,581 --> 01:13:45,550
What should we do? They are practicing.

1410
01:13:46,781 --> 01:13:49,481
(Some people watch them secretly as they practice.)

1411
01:13:54,451 --> 01:13:57,491
(Yeji and Chaeryeong of ITZY)

1412
01:13:58,291 --> 01:13:59,331
What?

1413
01:14:00,361 --> 01:14:02,661
- Hello. - Hello.

1414
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:04,730
Firstly, we brought snacks.

1415
01:14:04,731 --> 01:14:06,651
(It's a surprise visit the girls didn't expect.)

1416
01:14:06,871 --> 01:14:09,599
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1417
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:12,041
(They prepared the snacks to root for the girls.)

1418
01:14:12,241 --> 01:14:15,139
Suddenly, Chaeryeong and Yeji entered.

1419
01:14:15,140 --> 01:14:19,179
They looked like walking statues since they were so pretty.

1420
01:14:19,180 --> 01:14:21,750
I wondered if I was dreaming.

1421
01:14:21,850 --> 01:14:24,581
You were practicing diligently.

1422
01:14:25,191 --> 01:14:27,150
Would it be okay...

1423
01:14:27,151 --> 01:14:29,291
- if we watched the practice? - Yes.

1424
01:14:29,460 --> 01:14:31,020
You just got done. We are sorry.

1425
01:14:31,021 --> 01:14:32,230
- It's okay. - It's okay.

1426
01:14:32,231 --> 01:14:34,090
- Drink water. - Drink water.

1427
01:14:34,161 --> 01:14:36,331
- Tell us when you are ready. - Okay.

1428
01:14:36,861 --> 01:14:38,161
Let's go.

1429
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:39,401
I am so nervous.

1430
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:41,730
I bet the key is high. Do you use the original key?

1431
01:14:41,731 --> 01:14:42,900
Did you lower the key?

1432
01:14:42,901 --> 01:14:43,999
- We use the original key. - The original key.

1433
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Then it's high.

1434
01:14:45,340 --> 01:14:49,541
(Winners use the original key of "TT.")

1435
01:14:50,710 --> 01:14:53,581
But I can't tell it what to do

1436
01:14:53,750 --> 01:14:56,749
The more I try to push you away

1437
01:14:56,750 --> 01:14:59,389
The more I feel attracted

1438
01:14:59,390 --> 01:15:01,120
I just hit my innocent plushie

1439
01:15:01,121 --> 01:15:04,760
I sit and lie face down all day long Time passes fast

1440
01:15:07,630 --> 01:15:09,861
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1441
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:11,560
Firstly,

1442
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:14,531
- Seowon... - Yes.

1443
01:15:14,630 --> 01:15:17,370
- can sing very well. - Thank you.

1444
01:15:17,371 --> 01:15:18,840
You are really good.

1445
01:15:20,111 --> 01:15:24,309
Other members also had stable vocals,

1446
01:15:24,310 --> 01:15:26,750
so the performance was nice.

1447
01:15:26,810 --> 01:15:29,049
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1448
01:15:29,050 --> 01:15:30,880
Nako has great facial expressions.

1449
01:15:31,281 --> 01:15:32,420
Thank you.

1450
01:15:33,350 --> 01:15:36,560
I gave the performance a lot of thought...

1451
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:39,259
in order to appear cute,

1452
01:15:39,260 --> 01:15:41,531
so I suited the song well.

1453
01:15:42,861 --> 01:15:45,430
But there was something I was disappointed about.

1454
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:50,670
- Eunhyung. - Yes.

1455
01:15:51,071 --> 01:15:52,639
I got the sense...

1456
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:54,710
that you didn't practice the vocals well enough...

1457
01:15:54,970 --> 01:15:57,411
compared to your facial expressions and dance.

1458
01:15:57,680 --> 01:16:01,081
When it was your part, the vocals didn't seem to go well.

1459
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:04,021
- You should practice singing. - Okay.

1460
01:16:04,781 --> 01:16:07,920
I am very lacking right now.

1461
01:16:08,021 --> 01:16:09,860
I will practice hard...

1462
01:16:09,861 --> 01:16:12,031
so that I don't do the members a disservice.

1463
01:16:13,161 --> 01:16:15,059
- Thank you. - Good luck.

1464
01:16:15,060 --> 01:16:16,099
You worked hard.

1465
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:17,499
- Bye. - Thank you.

1466
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:20,400
- Bye. - Bye.

1467
01:16:20,401 --> 01:16:21,900
The performance is tomorrow, so take care of your condition.

1468
01:16:21,901 --> 01:16:23,541
- Okay. - Show them.

1469
01:16:28,781 --> 01:16:31,610
We wanted to teach you this. During this dance,

1470
01:16:31,611 --> 01:16:33,411
all of you tilt your head differently.

1471
01:16:33,651 --> 01:16:36,481
But when TWICE members begin,

1472
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:39,220
they tilt their heads toward the center.

1473
01:16:39,350 --> 01:16:41,521
That way, the center stands out.

1474
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:44,759
Your line of sight will be much neater.

1475
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:46,959
In the beginning, look at the center.

1476
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:48,059
- Okay. - Okay.

1477
01:16:48,060 --> 01:16:49,929
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1478
01:16:49,930 --> 01:16:51,600
- They gave us feedback. - Thank you.

1479
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:53,701
- I was so honored and thankful. - Good luck.

1480
01:16:53,771 --> 01:16:54,800
Good luck.

1481
01:16:55,170 --> 01:16:56,371
- Bye. - All right.

1482
01:16:57,670 --> 01:17:00,810
(It's time for another vocal lesson.)

1483
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:02,180
I can't do this

1484
01:17:02,541 --> 01:17:04,140
I can't do that

1485
01:17:04,481 --> 01:17:07,151
I just look, ba ba ba baby

1486
01:17:07,451 --> 01:17:08,719
Your vocal is too strong from the start...

1487
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:10,200
that it ruins the voices that follow.

1488
01:17:10,451 --> 01:17:11,720
Add a bit of falsetto.

1489
01:17:12,621 --> 01:17:14,021
I can't do this

1490
01:17:14,420 --> 01:17:15,860
I can't

1491
01:17:15,861 --> 01:17:17,160
Let's start over. It's okay.

1492
01:17:17,161 --> 01:17:19,841
- When you pronounce the words... - I haven't used falsetto before.

1493
01:17:20,060 --> 01:17:21,060
In that case,

1494
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:23,400
I think...

1495
01:17:23,401 --> 01:17:26,231
- someone else should try that part. - Okay.

1496
01:17:26,771 --> 01:17:28,469
I had that thought yesterday.

1497
01:17:28,470 --> 01:17:29,470
"It seems like..."

1498
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:32,210
"the parts might change."

1499
01:17:34,541 --> 01:17:35,781
Hye Rin, why don't you try it?

1500
01:17:36,611 --> 01:17:39,210
I can't do this

1501
01:17:39,510 --> 01:17:41,180
I can't do that

1502
01:17:41,451 --> 01:17:44,250
I just look, ba ba ba baby

1503
01:17:45,121 --> 01:17:47,321
Hyerin, why don't you sing this part?

1504
01:17:47,951 --> 01:17:50,059
Eunhyung, let's shine in a different part.

1505
01:17:50,060 --> 01:17:51,120
Okay.

1506
01:17:51,121 --> 01:17:53,890
I was really glad to receive this opportunity.

1507
01:17:55,331 --> 01:17:58,031
I gained a part.

1508
01:17:58,831 --> 01:18:00,331
When I sang it,

1509
01:18:00,630 --> 01:18:02,201
the instructor told me to take it.

1510
01:18:03,271 --> 01:18:05,340
(Yes!)

1511
01:18:06,071 --> 01:18:07,770
(That night, Cute Winners' practice room)

1512
01:18:07,771 --> 01:18:10,210
It's an individual competition too.

1513
01:18:10,441 --> 01:18:12,710
If I only have that part,

1514
01:18:12,951 --> 01:18:16,720
I am afraid that the judges won't see me.

1515
01:18:16,750 --> 01:18:18,950
"Will I be able to stand out?"

1516
01:18:18,951 --> 01:18:20,951
That thought fills my head.

1517
01:18:21,220 --> 01:18:22,691
I am worried.

1518
01:18:24,691 --> 01:18:26,330
Eunhyung.

1519
01:18:26,331 --> 01:18:28,066
(Vu Linh Dan approaches Eunhyung while she feels anxious.)

1520
01:18:28,090 --> 01:18:30,600
You can try the head voice.

1521
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,100
That's right.

1522
01:18:35,340 --> 01:18:36,770
(The team members help Eunhyung.)

1523
01:18:36,771 --> 01:18:37,839
Just go...

1524
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:39,371
(The team members help Eunhyung.)

1525
01:18:40,710 --> 01:18:42,640
This part is the best, right?

1526
01:18:43,111 --> 01:18:45,610
I want to create team harmony...

1527
01:18:45,611 --> 01:18:47,310
and give a good performance.

1528
01:18:47,981 --> 01:18:49,581
- Let's do well. - Okay.

1529
01:18:51,781 --> 01:18:54,191
I want to make a performance...

1530
01:18:54,291 --> 01:18:57,960
where each member can shine by showing her strengths only.

1531
01:18:58,390 --> 01:19:00,831
So we will have to try our best.

1532
01:19:01,090 --> 01:19:02,900
Everyone is good,

1533
01:19:02,901 --> 01:19:05,260
so I am glad to be a part of this team.

1534
01:19:05,871 --> 01:19:08,130
- I love this team. - You jump too much.

1535
01:19:08,771 --> 01:19:10,440
You are too excited.

1536
01:19:10,441 --> 01:19:11,770
(Cute Winners strengthen each other and become one team.)

1537
01:19:11,771 --> 01:19:12,840
Now,

1538
01:19:12,941 --> 01:19:14,610
let's bring up our energy level...

1539
01:19:14,611 --> 01:19:16,379
- as we did earlier. - Yes.

1540
01:19:16,380 --> 01:19:18,510
Let's survive together tomorrow.

1541
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:20,209
- Okay. - Give an energetic performance.

1542
01:19:20,210 --> 01:19:22,049
- Let's win. - Let's go.

1543
01:19:22,050 --> 01:19:23,480
- Let's win. - Let's go.

1544
01:19:23,481 --> 01:19:25,350
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1545
01:19:25,491 --> 01:19:27,951
- "TT," "TT," let's go. - "TT," "TT," let's go.

1546
01:19:28,390 --> 01:19:29,521
Let's go.

1547
01:19:31,321 --> 01:19:32,560
They really look like chicks.

1548
01:19:34,731 --> 01:19:35,760
I am curious.

1549
01:19:38,300 --> 01:19:39,701
How cute. They are cute already.

1550
01:19:40,930 --> 01:19:42,031
I can't wait.

1551
01:19:46,611 --> 01:19:50,411
("TT" by TWICE)

1552
01:19:51,411 --> 01:19:53,010
- How cute. - My goodness.

1553
01:19:53,380 --> 01:19:54,550
So cute.

1554
01:19:57,081 --> 01:19:58,481
How cute.

1555
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,371
How cute.

1556
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:52,741
So cute.

1557
01:22:27,100 --> 01:22:28,469
They are so cute.

1558
01:22:28,470 --> 01:22:29,570
So cute.

1559
01:22:29,571 --> 01:22:31,171
- They are really cute. - They are good.

1560
01:22:34,371 --> 01:22:36,781
- Seriously. - I can't help but call them cute.

1561
01:22:37,111 --> 01:22:38,481
They are really good.

1562
01:22:38,781 --> 01:22:40,151
They did really well.

1563
01:22:40,651 --> 01:22:42,821
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1564
01:22:48,350 --> 01:22:50,860
Every member stood out,

1565
01:22:50,861 --> 01:22:53,929
and the team gave a performance that was put-together.

1566
01:22:53,930 --> 01:22:55,759
I want to applaud that.

1567
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:57,901
I could see each member's unique charms.

1568
01:22:58,260 --> 01:22:59,870
The team has many members...

1569
01:22:59,871 --> 01:23:02,130
and this is only our second time seeing them.

1570
01:23:02,340 --> 01:23:04,440
I wasn't familiar with everyone,

1571
01:23:04,441 --> 01:23:06,639
so I looked at the lyrics sheet and went, "Whose part is this?"

1572
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:08,771
Then I checked as I watched the performance.

1573
01:23:09,140 --> 01:23:11,010
I drew a heart over a heart.

1574
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:13,010
I drew another heart over it.

1575
01:23:13,481 --> 01:23:17,180
All members' unique charms could be seen...

1576
01:23:17,451 --> 01:23:19,491
during the performance.

1577
01:23:19,550 --> 01:23:20,950
I think it was a very successful performance...

1578
01:23:20,951 --> 01:23:22,589
to give for the second battle.

1579
01:23:22,590 --> 01:23:24,691
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1580
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:28,760
Yuri.

1581
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:30,259
- Yuri, - Yes?

1582
01:23:30,260 --> 01:23:32,969
I liked how you really stood out when you sang...

1583
01:23:32,970 --> 01:23:34,170
your first part.

1584
01:23:39,541 --> 01:23:42,680
I liked how you performed in a stylish way.

1585
01:23:43,180 --> 01:23:44,340
Thank you.

1586
01:23:44,810 --> 01:23:46,581
As for Nako...

1587
01:23:46,781 --> 01:23:48,481
As for Nako,

1588
01:23:48,581 --> 01:23:51,419
I paid attention to her since Round One.

1589
01:23:51,420 --> 01:23:54,121
I was surprised by how well she performed.

1590
01:23:54,220 --> 01:23:56,390
As for Gabi,

1591
01:23:56,420 --> 01:23:58,860
it was great to learn that you are capable...

1592
01:23:58,861 --> 01:24:01,690
of putting on a performance of this concept.

1593
01:24:01,691 --> 01:24:04,161
- Right. Thank you. - Thank you.

1594
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:07,170
- Seowon. - Me?

1595
01:24:07,371 --> 01:24:09,371
You looked so calm.

1596
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:14,309
It felt like you were leading this team.

1597
01:24:14,310 --> 01:24:16,809
I want to tell you that you did a really great job.

1598
01:24:16,810 --> 01:24:18,210
Thank you!

1599
01:24:20,510 --> 01:24:23,020
Last but not least, Hyerin.

1600
01:24:23,021 --> 01:24:24,021
Yes?

1601
01:24:24,321 --> 01:24:26,790
I've been drawing heart after heart next to this person.

1602
01:24:26,791 --> 01:24:29,389
That person turned out to be you.

1603
01:24:29,390 --> 01:24:31,321
(It turned out to be you.)

1604
01:24:31,590 --> 01:24:32,930
- Thank you. - Seriously.

1605
01:24:34,260 --> 01:24:37,499
You didn't grab my attention right away. But I kept thinking about you.

1606
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:40,099
You've really shown who you are.

1607
01:24:40,100 --> 01:24:43,970
I think this performance really made me rethink about you.

1608
01:24:44,140 --> 01:24:46,041
- I really enjoyed it. - Thank you.

1609
01:24:48,670 --> 01:24:50,741
You all worked really hard.

1610
01:24:51,210 --> 01:24:53,209
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1611
01:24:53,210 --> 01:24:54,750
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1612
01:24:59,220 --> 01:25:01,790
Here are the battle results.

1613
01:25:01,791 --> 01:25:03,691
(The Cute Revenge Battle results get revealed.)

1614
01:25:04,521 --> 01:25:06,861
The winner of the Cute concept is...

1615
01:25:10,096 --> 01:25:12,566
Here are the battle results.

1616
01:25:12,567 --> 01:25:14,527
(The Cute Revenge Battle results get revealed.)

1617
01:25:15,367 --> 01:25:17,766
The winner of the Cute concept is...

1618
01:25:18,537 --> 01:25:19,936
To be honest,

1619
01:25:21,136 --> 01:25:24,936
I believed we had a higher chance of winning.

1620
01:25:25,506 --> 01:25:29,617
We had a lot of talented members.

1621
01:25:30,447 --> 01:25:32,846
That's why I had that confidence.

1622
01:25:36,016 --> 01:25:37,716
I wish to survive.

1623
01:25:38,617 --> 01:25:40,185
I want to survive...

1624
01:25:40,186 --> 01:25:44,027
and make another challenge in the next mission.

1625
01:25:46,197 --> 01:25:48,527
It's Cute Winners.

1626
01:25:49,037 --> 01:25:50,696
(Cute Winners win the Revenge Battle.)

1627
01:25:50,697 --> 01:25:53,707
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1628
01:25:57,006 --> 01:25:59,505
- Great job. - Great job.

1629
01:25:59,506 --> 01:26:01,675
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1630
01:26:01,676 --> 01:26:05,276
With a score of 4 to 1, Team Cute Winners takes the win.

1631
01:26:05,277 --> 01:26:06,917
Thank you for your hard work.

1632
01:26:08,086 --> 01:26:10,657
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1633
01:26:12,556 --> 01:26:14,486
Winners, please wait for...

1634
01:26:14,487 --> 01:26:16,796
the Unicorn Ticketing that will happen soon.

1635
01:26:19,167 --> 01:26:22,197
All members of the losing team must earn tickets from the fans...

1636
01:26:22,367 --> 01:26:25,266
to be able to advance to the Universe.

1637
01:26:25,806 --> 01:26:27,326
I thank all of you for your hard work.

1638
01:26:27,407 --> 01:26:29,276
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1639
01:26:29,277 --> 01:26:30,377
Thank you.

1640
01:26:34,346 --> 01:26:35,606
Oh, no.

1641
01:26:35,607 --> 01:26:37,377
Don't cry.

1642
01:26:44,686 --> 01:26:46,686
I'm going to get eliminated anyway.

1643
01:26:46,886 --> 01:26:48,586
No way.

1644
01:26:48,726 --> 01:26:50,556
- I love that our team won. - Don't say that.

1645
01:26:53,966 --> 01:26:55,796
What's wrong?

1646
01:26:56,167 --> 01:26:57,435
You shouldn't cry.

1647
01:26:57,436 --> 01:26:59,835
If you get eliminated, it's the same for me.

1648
01:26:59,836 --> 01:27:01,167
What are you talking about?

1649
01:27:01,466 --> 01:27:03,306
There are so many talented people here.

1650
01:27:03,676 --> 01:27:05,636
Everyone did a good job. Except me.

1651
01:27:07,546 --> 01:27:09,046
(Not everyone can survive.)

1652
01:27:09,516 --> 01:27:10,747
(It's not a team battle.)

1653
01:27:11,516 --> 01:27:13,487
(Should it be seen as an individual battle?)

1654
01:27:13,787 --> 01:27:14,907
(Can I try this part again?)

1655
01:27:15,117 --> 01:27:16,787
(I really want this part.)

1656
01:27:17,086 --> 01:27:18,526
(Can you let her take it this time?)

1657
01:27:19,186 --> 01:27:20,925
(To win, )

1658
01:27:20,926 --> 01:27:23,696
(I must do what I'm good at.)

1659
01:27:23,697 --> 01:27:25,417
(The movements don't match toward the end.)

1660
01:27:25,697 --> 01:27:29,027
(Jang Sua is quite slow when it comes to learning things.)

1661
01:27:30,997 --> 01:27:33,707
(Is there another issue maker?)

1662
01:27:34,207 --> 01:27:35,487
(I'm not sure what the note is.)

1663
01:27:37,377 --> 01:27:38,737
(She's lacking skills already.)

1664
01:27:39,646 --> 01:27:42,346
(I can't seem to do it because of the camera.)

1665
01:27:42,777 --> 01:27:45,346
("Why am I doing this?")

1666
01:27:45,787 --> 01:27:48,287
(I really want to go home.)

1667
01:27:48,987 --> 01:27:51,016
(Something's wrong right now.)

1668
01:27:53,756 --> 01:27:54,996
(A sudden act out of the blue?)

1669
01:27:56,096 --> 01:27:57,357
(It's too hard.)

1670
01:27:57,697 --> 01:28:01,396
(Can the girls overcome this crisis and go up on stage?)

1671
01:28:13,006 --> 01:28:14,077
Let's go!

1672
01:28:19,346 --> 01:28:20,886
I can't choose.

1673
01:28:21,247 --> 01:28:22,487
This is tough.

1674
01:28:25,926 --> 01:28:27,657
The dream ticketing for the debut.

1675
01:28:28,226 --> 01:28:30,596
Vote for your favorite girl.

01:28:31,426 --> 01:28:34,626

01:28:39,836 --> 01:28:42,005

1679
01:28:42,006 --> 01:28:44,577
