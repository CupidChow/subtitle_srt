"I'm very excited about the things that will happen."

13
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:34,968

I love it.

126
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:18,769

134
00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:38,120
(The bubbly lyrics and melody are the charms of this song.)

135
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,990
This is a great song.

136
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:44,259

139
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,009
- Gosh. - Why are you all rushing?

140
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,378
Where are you going?

141
00:08:58,379 --> 00:09:03,378
(The contestants find their seats based on their favorite song.)

142
00:09:03,379 --> 00:09:04,919
- All seats are taken. - Did you choose our song?

143
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:08,149

I will be performing "Miracle."

148
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:20,028
Just the thought of being able to meet the fans in person...

149
00:09:20,029 --> 00:09:22,999
overwhelms me.

150
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,768
I just want to meet them now.

151
00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:28,639
I can't wait for the Final.

152
00:09:28,809 --> 00:09:31,178
I was able to make it this far...

153
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:33,639
thanks to the support of the fans.

154
00:09:34,049 --> 00:09:35,679
I'm just delighted and amazed by that.

155
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:39,648
It's the first performance I'll meet the fans with.

156
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:42,049
I really want to do well for them.

157
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:45,019
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

158
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:46,758
I think I will remember this performance...

159
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:48,459
more than any other performance.

160
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:51,960
I'm most expectant and excited about that.

161
00:09:53,029 --> 00:09:55,128
It's a team slogan.

162
00:09:55,129 --> 00:10:00,710
"Miracle Time" describes the time we will spend together.

163
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:05,638
I wanted to have the word "our" in our slogan.

164
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:08,580
- Please get tickets to our dreams. - Please get tickets to our dreams.

165
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:14,918
We will be in front of many people including our fans.

166
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:16,849
It's my first time doing that.

167
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:19,589
I'm very excited.

168
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:25,758
They have been watching and supporting us from the start.

169
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:28,200
That makes it even more special.

170
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:33,070
The fans have been supporting us all this time.

171
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:37,740
I'm excited to meet them.

172
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:42,878
It's an opportunity to send them our gratefulness.

173
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:45,350
We will do our best.

174
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,250
I'll be performing in the Final.

175
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:51,189
Compared to all the other performances I did,

176
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:54,690
I want to look the best and enjoy it the most.

177
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:57,830
This is our slogan.

178
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:03,629
I wrote it hoping that everyone will remember our performance.

179
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,600
- Please get tickets to our dreams. - Please get tickets to our dreams.

180
00:11:06,669 --> 00:11:09,840
(Everyone will remember this "White" moment.)

181
00:11:09,909 --> 00:11:11,678
(Everyone will remember this "White" moment.)

182
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:13,138
(Kotoko)

183
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:14,579
Right. We could feel the excitement they have for the Final...

184
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:17,349
and the hearts they have for their fans...

185
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,750
through their slogans.

186
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,819
For the Arranged Song Performance,

187
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,749
according to the results of the Second Promotion Ceremony,

188
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:29,259
Team "White" will have 9 members and Team "Miracle will have 7.

189
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:33,059
Let's meet Team "White" first.

190
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:50,610
("White" arranged by GALACTIKA)

191
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:50,138
(Everyone will remember this "White" moment.)

192
00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:51,440
(Sumin, there are too many people waiting for our wedding.)

193
00:13:54,909 --> 00:13:56,740
(Make your debut, Kim Sumin!)

194
00:14:21,769 --> 00:14:23,600
Nana!

195
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:25,200
Great job!

196
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:26,500
Awesome!

197
00:14:30,009 --> 00:14:32,479
That was a beautiful pure-white performance.

198
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,009
That was Team "White."

199
00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:37,209
They have experienced your passionate support.

200
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:41,720
I believe they will remember this moment for a very long time.

201
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,388
If you wish to send even more support,

202
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:48,058
check in through the QR code on the screen...

203
00:14:48,059 --> 00:14:52,159
and participate in the Fan Ticketing.

204
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:53,999
Up next,

205
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,499
this team will sing about the miraculous moment...

206
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,100
of achieving a dream.

207
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,839
Let's meet Team "Miracle."

208
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:04,009
It's Miracle Time!

209
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,658
("Miracle" arranged by VENDORS)

210
00:15:17,659 --> 00:15:19,519
Let's go!

211
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,230
Let's go, Lim Seowon!

212
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:07,219
It was a miraculous performance.

213
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:10,160
They were Team "White."

214
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:12,598
I believe it shined even brighter...

215
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:16,000
with their sincerity for their dream.

216
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:18,939
I wonder how the Unicorns liked the performance.

217
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,769
Unicorn Se Jeong, what do you think?

218
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,068
I got choked up again.

219
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:25,180
Me too.

220
00:18:25,339 --> 00:18:28,750
Both teams showed brilliant performances.

221
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,179
It's hard to tell which one was better.

222
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,379
- I don't have to pick now, right? - No.

223
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,288
I can tell both teams worked hard.

224
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:36,318
They both shined as teams.

225
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:38,818
Each member shined brightly.

226
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:41,990
It felt like there would be a white, beautiful miracle.

227
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:44,930
I hope there will be a miracle for everyone.

228
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,160
Please give her a big hand. Thank you.

229
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,970
All right. Unicorn Rian, how did you like it?

230
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,338
Seriously,

231
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:55,710
I'm grateful that they showed a great performance for the finals.

232
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:58,338
I've watched them from the very beginning.

233
00:18:58,339 --> 00:18:59,339
That's right.

234
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,449
They perform like pros now.

235
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,109
They are pros, seriously.

236
00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:07,079
I hope all 16 of them will debut.

237
00:19:08,089 --> 00:19:09,589
- Right. - I think we all feel the same way.

238
00:19:09,619 --> 00:19:11,288
Right. Thank you for your hard work.

239
00:19:11,289 --> 00:19:12,789
Please give her a big hand.

240
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:16,529
She says they are like pros.

241
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,299
Now, it's time...

242
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:22,599
to make a decision that you can't avoid.

243
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:26,069
Unicorns, I understand it's hard,

244
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,440
but I'd like you to choose the winning team.

245
00:19:34,849 --> 00:19:39,220
Producer TENZO will go first.

246
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:40,549
All right.

247
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,849
This is hard.

248
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,920
The team I chose is...

249
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,859
Team "White."

250
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:51,598
Team "White" is chosen.

251
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:54,058
The score is 1 to 0. Team "White" is leading.

252
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:56,700
Next up is Unicorn Younha.

253
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:00,798
This is the first round, but it's already hard to decide.

254
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,440
The two teams have different charms.

255
00:20:04,809 --> 00:20:07,480
So I'm not sure what result my decision will bring.

256
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,450
The winning team I chose is...

257
00:20:11,849 --> 00:20:12,979
Team "Miracle."

258
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,018
Team "Miracle."

259
00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:15,449
It's is 1 to 1 now.

260
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:16,920
The score is even.

261
00:20:17,019 --> 00:20:18,519
Unicorn Se Jeong.

262
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:21,219
Both teams were really pretty.

263
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,029
But there was a team that made my heart flutter.

264
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,259
The winning team I chose is...

265
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,730
Team "Miracle."

266
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:33,099
Team "Miracle" turned the tables and made the score 2 to 1.

267
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,369
Unicorn Hyoyeon.

268
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:43,650
Both teams did well, showing their amazing charms.

269
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,250
The winning team I chose is...

270
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,549
Team "Miracle."

271
00:20:49,619 --> 00:20:50,788
Team "Miracle."

272
00:20:50,789 --> 00:20:54,059
They are winning with a score of 3 to 1.

273
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:55,858
We know the result already,

274
00:20:55,859 --> 00:20:58,529
but we will still hear Unicorn Rian's decision.

275
00:20:58,859 --> 00:21:00,559
This isn't...

276
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,130
a sympathy vote.

277
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:04,900
I picked Team "White" from the beginning.

278
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:08,670
That's right. The Unicorns' choice...

279
00:21:09,109 --> 00:21:12,909
is Team "Miracle" with a score of 3 to 2.

280
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,009
Congratulations!

281
00:21:14,609 --> 00:21:15,880
- Thank you. - Thank you.

282
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:22,619
Among Team "Miracle" who is chosen by the Unicorns,

283
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,160
one member will be promoted...

284
00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:27,920
by Unicorn Ticketing.

285
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,890
Which member will be promoted after the Arranged Song Performance?

286
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,098
It will be announced with the final promotion result...

287
00:21:35,099 --> 00:21:38,640
after all the performances are over.

288
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,740
Which one of Team "Miracle" will get promoted then?

289
00:21:41,869 --> 00:21:43,839
Please stay tuned until the end and find out.

290
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:47,839
Wait. Is there anyone who hasn't participated in Fan Ticketing yet?

291
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,808
Please remember Fan Ticketing will decide...

292
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,618
the members to debut.

293
00:21:52,619 --> 00:21:54,548
Please make sure to participate.

294
00:21:54,549 --> 00:21:56,288

the New Song Performance based on the theme of "PRISM."

312
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:47,038
Producer ADORA...

313
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:51,368
helped them as a special Unicorn for the New Song Performance.

314
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:52,379
Please give her a big hand.

(Special Unicorn ADORA)

316
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,719
The producers went through a special casting process...

317
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,889
for the New Song Performance.

318
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,450
Let's watch it together.

319
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,420
(Before the Final Station, )

320
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:08,689
(the contestants arrived somewhere.)

321
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:09,989
My gosh.

322
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:11,459
- My goodness. - What's that?

323
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,499
Look at that.

324
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,660
- My gosh. - Why?

325
00:23:15,369 --> 00:23:17,029
- Hello. - Hello.

326
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,699
- Hello. - Oh, no.

327
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,038
- Hello. - Hello.

328
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:21,568
(Why are the producers here to meet the contestants?)

329
00:23:21,569 --> 00:23:22,739
- Hello. - Hello.

330
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,939
- So this is it. - My gosh.

331
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,380
Sorry.

332
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,609
DOPAMIN and camera?

333
00:23:29,109 --> 00:23:30,450
What's all this?

334
00:23:30,849 --> 00:23:34,349
The producers will cast the members...

335
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:37,750
of the teams for the Final Station.

336
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,619
Casting?

337
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:43,359
Casting? My gosh.

338
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:46,758
There are six different positions.

339
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:50,569
The producers will pick the contestants they want...

340
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,569
and put their photos on the boards.

341
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:58,910
If they pick the same contestant for the same position,

342
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,079
the selected contestant...

343
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:02,778
gets to pick a song.

344
00:24:02,779 --> 00:24:05,079
(The contestant selected by two teams gets to pick a song.)

345
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,419
We will appreciate your help.

347
00:24:07,819 --> 00:24:08,890
I'm nervous.

348
00:24:09,819 --> 00:24:12,289
- I'm excited. - I'm excited.

349
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,660
Our song is called "DOPAMINE."

350
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:17,159
("DOPAMINE")

351
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:21,160
(The song describes the contestants' energy with a metaphor of "PRISM.")

352
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:24,170
The song we prepared is called "Camera."

353
00:24:24,369 --> 00:24:26,538
("Camera")

354
00:24:26,539 --> 00:24:28,969
(The song is about the contestants with prism-like, various charms.)

355
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:31,339
All right. The first position to cast is...

356
00:24:31,609 --> 00:24:32,709
the main vocalist.

357
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:36,450
(The first position is the main vocalist.)

358
00:24:36,549 --> 00:24:40,579
Which contestant do you want for the main vocalist?

359
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,219
- One, - My goodness.

360
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,818
- two, - Why?

361
00:24:44,819 --> 00:24:45,890
Three.

362
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:47,758
(Elisia, Elisia)

363
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:52,000
(They both picked Elisia.)

364
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,299
- My gosh. - Oh, dear.

365
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,069
This is so cruel.

366
00:24:56,099 --> 00:24:58,739
- Gosh, I'm feeling nervous now. - I know.

367
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,068
I'm nervous.

368
00:25:00,069 --> 00:25:03,268
(She will make a decision after listening to the two songs.)

369
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:05,210
You will hear "DOPAMINE" first.

370
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,309
- Good. - I'm curious.

371
00:25:07,609 --> 00:25:10,410
(Elisia is listening to "DOPAMINE.")

372
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,720
I'm so curious.

373
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:13,849
Her facial expression is interesting.

374
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,349
Now it's "Camera."

375
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,960
She's dancing to the beats.

376
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:22,230
I bet the song is quite groovy.

377
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,230
Elisia.

378
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:27,629
Please pick the song you want to perform.

379
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:28,729
(What's the song chosen by Elisia?)

380
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:30,930
No. Hang on a second.

381
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:31,970
She's cute.

382
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,239
(Elisia's choice is "Camera.")

383
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,379
- It's us. - Yes!

384
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,380
(Elisia's choice is "Camera.")

385
00:25:41,609 --> 00:25:44,008
My goodness. This is so thrilling.

386
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:45,049
I'm sorry.

387
00:25:45,819 --> 00:25:46,919
Then we should...

388
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,979
(Friday of GALACTIKA)

389
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:50,089
pick Elisia's rival.

390
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,349
- It's Seowon. - Seowon.

391
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,490
It's Seowon.

392
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,858
(The main vocalist of Team "DOPAMINE," Lim Seowon)

393
00:25:54,859 --> 00:25:55,889
The forever rival.

394
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:57,828
- They are forever rivals. - My gosh.

395
00:25:57,829 --> 00:25:58,959
It has to be Seowon.

396
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,199
(It's the main vocalist match of two rivals.)

397
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,629
All right. Now it's the highlight.

398
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:05,639
(The second position is the highlight.)

399
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,569
One, two, three.

400
00:26:08,769 --> 00:26:10,669
(They both picked Nana.)

401
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:12,309
- Oh, no. - It's the same again.

402
00:26:13,309 --> 00:26:14,309
- My gosh. - Come on.

403
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:16,149
Hey, why are you doing this?

404
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:17,680
- Come on. - Please.

405
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,818
You'll hear "DOPAMINE" first.

406
00:26:19,819 --> 00:26:22,119
("DOPAMINE" by GALACTIKA plays first.)

407
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:24,549
Look at her. It's fast.

408
00:26:25,789 --> 00:26:27,359
I think "DOPAMINE" has a quick tempo.

409
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,989
Now you'll hear "Camera."

410
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,258
(Now "Camera" by PAPERMAKER plays.)

411
00:26:31,259 --> 00:26:32,328
What's that?

412
00:26:32,329 --> 00:26:33,358
(Surprised)

413
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:34,758
(Curious)

414
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:35,798
What is it?

415
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:37,629
(I know what it's like.)

416
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:38,670
Nana.

417
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:40,400
- Please make a choice. - Okay.

418
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,240
One,

419
00:26:43,509 --> 00:26:44,509
two,

420
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:46,940
three.

421
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,349
(Hesitant)

422
00:26:52,849 --> 00:26:55,548
(Nana's choice is "DOPAMINE.")

423
00:26:55,549 --> 00:26:56,689
Nana!

424
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:58,419
Should I make a deep bow or something?

425
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,660
- A deep bow? - What do I do?

426
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,289
Thank you.

427
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,130
- Thank you. - Thank you.

428
00:27:05,329 --> 00:27:06,799
- Then we should go with Yunha. - Please pick one.

429
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,499
(The highlight of Team "Camera," Bang Yunha)

430
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,500
Thank you.

431
00:27:14,069 --> 00:27:15,509
Next is the main dancer.

432
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:17,639
- My gosh. - Thank goodness.

433
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,209
(The main dancer of Team "Camera," Bae Haram)

434
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:20,779
- Amazing. - Bae Haram.

435
00:27:21,109 --> 00:27:22,179
Rap.

436
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,879
(Rappers of Team "Camera," Gabi, Kim Sumin)

437
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,049
- My gosh. - Sumin.

438
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:26,848
- Yes. - Sumin.

439
00:27:26,849 --> 00:27:27,920
What?

440
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:29,250
Lead vocalist.

441
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:31,250
It's Yuri.

442
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:33,358
(Lead vocalists of Team "Camera," Lee Sunwoo, Gehlee Dangca, Yuri)

443

Yuri.

444
00:27:35,829 --> 00:27:38,758
(Sub vocalist of Team "Camera," Jeon Jinyeong)

445
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:40,859
The members of Team "Camera" have been decided.

446
00:27:41,099 --> 00:27:44,969
I believe "Camera" describes us perfectly.

447
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:47,368
No matter how great...

448
00:27:47,369 --> 00:27:50,909
Team "DOPAMINE" 's performance is,

449
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:55,209
we will pull off our song perfectly,

450
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:57,950
and all the audience will point their cameras at us.

451
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:02,150
I will try to show all the hard work I've done.

452
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:04,890
I'll try to shine the brightest.

453
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:08,690
I will captivate your hearts.

454
00:28:12,829 --> 00:28:15,230
Now you should pick rappers.

455
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,499
(Rapper of Team "DOPAMINE," Kotoko)

456
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,170
- My gosh. - Amazing.

457
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,039
Lead vocalists.

458
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:25,308
- What? - My gosh.

459
00:28:25,309 --> 00:28:27,410
(Lead vocalists of Team "DOPAMINE," Jin Hyeonju, Oh Yoona)

460
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,450
It's Narumi.

461
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:30,980
"DOPAMINE!"

462
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:33,079
- My gosh. - Really?

463
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:35,589
Okay. We're a team!

464
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:37,848
I think our team...

465
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:40,459
has stronger contestants.

466
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:44,089
I think "DOPAMINE" is more powerful.

467
00:28:44,529 --> 00:28:47,460
I think it's a cool song.

468
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:52,769
So I believe our team will be able to show a great performance.

469
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,910
I think we can win.

470
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:59,779
My goal for the Final Station is to win.

471
00:29:00,509 --> 00:29:05,349
I will work even harder to reach not just Level R but Level P.

472
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:08,279
I'll work hard so I'll make my debut.

473
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:17,189
(Which team will be the winner of the New Song Performance?)

474
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,459
(Oh Yoona, Bang Yunha)

475
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,499
Good luck!

476
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,328
Since this is the final match for their debut,

477
00:29:22,329 --> 00:29:25,000
an extremely close competition is expected.

478
00:29:25,299 --> 00:29:29,509
If you haven't decided on the contestants...

479
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:31,640
to cast your votes for,

480
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:35,079
you will have to watch the upcoming performances carefully.

481
00:29:35,509 --> 00:29:37,479
Here's the first team for the New Song Performance.

482
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:41,950
They will show their energy shining brightly like PRISM.

483
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,589
It's Team "DOPAMINE."

("DOPAMINE" by GALACTIKA)

485
00:30:00,369 --> 00:30:01,400

(Jin Hyeonju, Kotoko, Bang Yunha)

(Hwang Sieun, Jin Hyeonju)

488
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,309
That was amazing.

489
00:32:57,509 --> 00:32:58,979
It wasn't just about their energy.

490
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:03,119
It was a performance filled with dopamine.

491
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,588
I think a lot of people...

492
00:33:05,589 --> 00:33:09,259
have fallen for the powerful performance of Team "DOPAMINE."

493
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:12,400
Everyone, there will be one more performance.

494

The New Song Performance...

495
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,529
to go against Team "DOPAMINE," it's Team "Camera."

496
00:33:17,869 --> 00:33:20,739
Will Team "Camera" be able...

497
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:23,140
to show a performance that overpowers Team "DOPAMINE?"

498
00:33:23,309 --> 00:33:25,109
Let's watch it now.

499
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,778
It's Team "Camera"...

500

That was a refreshing, yet powerful performance...

by Team "Camera."

507
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:49,480
Team "DOPAMINE" and Team "Camera."

508
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:52,920
Choosing between the two will be hard.

509
00:36:53,079 --> 00:36:56,119
Let's see how the judges felt.

510
00:36:56,349 --> 00:36:59,459
First off, Unicorn Hyoyeon. How was it?

511
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,519
Goodness.

512
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:03,190
While watching the performance,

513
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:06,729
I was sure the team exceeded the producers' expectations...

514
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:10,599
in expressing the vibe of this song.

515
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:13,468
It was amazing and cool.

516
00:37:13,469 --> 00:37:14,699
Great work.

517
00:37:14,769 --> 00:37:16,469

Next, Unicorn Younha.

520
00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:24,808
Everyone did so well. I want to talk about each of you if I could.

521
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:27,178
First off, Yunha and Nana.

522
00:37:27,179 --> 00:37:29,049
You two were good from the start.

523
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:32,819
But you kept improving bit by bit until now.

524
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:35,658
And today, you showed us the most perfect stage.

525
00:37:35,659 --> 00:37:38,029
I'd like to thank you for that.

526
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:42,000
Here's something I want to say to Hyeonju.

527
00:37:42,099 --> 00:37:46,399
When the performance and choreography are clean,

528
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,799
you shine more.

529
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,839
Sticking to your basic skills...

530
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,679
is something that was shown a lot in this performance.

531
00:37:54,309 --> 00:37:57,279
To my knowledge, you had two debuts,

532
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,149
and this was your fourth challenge.

533
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:02,489
You went through so much.

534
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:06,218
But you proved to us that polishing up...

535
00:38:06,219 --> 00:38:09,130
makes one a masterpiece, not a secondhand good.

536
00:38:09,289 --> 00:38:10,859
A big round of applause, please.

537
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:14,429

538
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,669
However, the toughest time...

539
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:18,900
has come for the Unicorns.

540
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:22,268

00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:30,050
Firstly,

543
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:33,219
Producer Adora.

544
00:38:33,579 --> 00:38:35,449
Whose performance did you like more?

545
00:38:36,789 --> 00:38:39,988
As we had the audience with us,

546
00:38:39,989 --> 00:38:43,760
everyone performed as if...

547
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,260
they were in the element.

548
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,999
It felt like I was watching a music show.

549
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,900
I have become your fan.

550
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:54,999
Even though it's extremely hard,

551
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,710
I must choose one team.

552
00:38:58,269 --> 00:39:01,610
The team I will choose as the winner is...

553
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:05,049
Team "Camera."

554
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:06,249
Team "Camera."

555
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:08,820
Team "Camera" takes the lead by 1 to 0.

556
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:11,650
Continuing on, Unicorn Younha.

557
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,489
I choose Team "DOPAMINE."

558
00:39:16,659 --> 00:39:18,388
Team "DOPAMINE." It's 1 to 1 now.

559
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:19,598
The score is back to square one.

560
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:21,329
Next, Unicorn Se Jeong.

561
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:24,599
I chose the team that got me hooked more.

562
00:39:24,869 --> 00:39:26,368
Team "DOPAMINE."

563
00:39:26,369 --> 00:39:27,738
Team "DOPAMINE" has turned the table.

564
00:39:27,739 --> 00:39:29,109
It's now 2 to 1.

565
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:31,138
Moving on, Unicorn Hyoyeon.

566
00:39:31,139 --> 00:39:33,480
Yes. The team I will choose as the winner is...

567
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:35,138
Team "Camera."

568
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:36,348
Team "Camera." It's 2 to 2!

569
00:39:36,349 --> 00:39:39,179
Once again, the score is back to square one.

570
00:39:39,579 --> 00:39:43,690
The two teams' destiny lies in her hands.

571
00:39:43,789 --> 00:39:45,090
Unicorn Rian.

572
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:47,719
I can really feel the heavy burden.

573
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,929
I choose Team "DOPAMINE."

574
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:52,959
Team "DOPAMINE!"

575
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,428
With 3 to 2, they have turned the table and won!

576
00:39:56,429 --> 00:39:57,599
Congratulations!

577
00:39:59,739 --> 00:40:04,038
One member will be selected from Team "DOPAMINE,"

578
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:07,578
the New Song Performance's winner, to be promoted through...

579
00:40:07,579 --> 00:40:09,210
Unicorn Ticketing.

580
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:11,849
The member promoted...

581
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:15,018
from the New Song Performance will be revealed...

582
00:40:15,019 --> 00:40:16,719
with the final promotion result.

583
00:40:16,949 --> 00:40:19,189
With this, all battle performances...

584
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:22,119
of the Final Station have ended.

585
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:26,500
The final Fan Ticketing that will determine...

586
00:40:27,329 --> 00:40:29,730
the final members' destiny...

587
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:32,699
will now close.

588
00:40:34,739 --> 00:40:39,380
Five, four, three, two, one!

589
00:40:40,139 --> 00:40:41,210
It has now closed!

590
00:40:43,409 --> 00:40:44,779
A round of applause, please.

591
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,578
(Additional votes will not be reflected.)

592
00:40:46,579 --> 00:40:50,389
Thank you to everyone who has cast their votes through Fan Ticketing.

593
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:53,659
Global girl group debut project, Universe Ticket.

594
00:40:53,789 --> 00:40:55,788
All that is left is the miracle moment...

595
00:40:55,789 --> 00:40:59,230
where the girls' dreams become a reality.

596
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:02,159
The contestants who advanced to the Final Station...

597
00:41:02,429 --> 00:41:05,669
had time to look back on the memories...

598
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:07,038
they made together.

599
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:09,138
How they looked back on them...

600
00:41:09,139 --> 00:41:12,578
and how they wrapped up their Universe Ticket journey.

601
00:41:12,579 --> 00:41:14,039
Let's take a look.

602
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:18,550
- Gosh, this is really nice. - There's chocolate!

603
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:20,819
I've never visited a campsite before.

604
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,319
- Really? - This is my first time camping.

605
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,388
My gosh.

606
00:41:23,389 --> 00:41:25,289
I've never done camping before in my life.

607
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:26,460
Me too.

608
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:29,190
By the way, isn't winter cold?

609
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,960
Korea's winter is too cold.

610
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:34,259
(She agrees.)

611
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,260
- You're right. - Right?

612
00:41:35,261 --> 00:41:37,730
But the fur on the collar is keeping me warm.

613
00:41:37,869 --> 00:41:40,000
- I love it. - It's so soft.

614
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:43,368
The shortness of the puffer jacket...

615
00:41:43,369 --> 00:41:45,468
is so trendy and nice.

616
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:46,979
- And it's light. - Yes.

617
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,879
It's easy to move around as we camp.

618
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,880
Totally.

619
00:41:49,881 --> 00:41:51,448
It's bringing up the camp vibe.

620
00:41:51,449 --> 00:41:53,848
(Before they know it, night has come.)

621
00:41:53,849 --> 00:41:55,919
You know how we performed...

622
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,149
many stages together until the Final Station?

623
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:01,059
Were there any moments you felt grateful to each other?

624
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:05,329
- It was Sumin to me. - Me?

625
00:42:05,489 --> 00:42:08,598
- Why? - Because our first team together...

626
00:42:08,599 --> 00:42:10,029
- was "Superstar." - Yes.

627
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:11,999
Everyone was older than me,

628
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,368
so getting close to them wasn't easy.

629
00:42:14,369 --> 00:42:17,839
How do I put it? You took care of the juniors well.

630
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:21,210
- So I'm thankful to you, Sumin. - What? Really?

631
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,279
I bet everyone is thankful to Sunwoo and Hyeonju.

632
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,479
- Totally. - Yes.

633
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,779
The two people.

634
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:28,649
You were the reliable eldest sisters.

635
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:30,288
(Everyone relied on the eldest sisters.)

636
00:42:30,289 --> 00:42:31,449
Our eldest sisters.

637
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:32,959
- Me too. - Really?

638
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,859
(The times they were grateful to each other)

639
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:35,959
Give me a hug.

640
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,190
(The times they were grateful to each other)

641
00:42:39,159 --> 00:42:40,599
- Same here. - Really?

642
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,468
(Episode 1: Beginning)

643
00:42:47,469 --> 00:42:48,699
- What's that? - What?

644
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,409
- Episodes? - What is it?

645
00:42:51,739 --> 00:42:52,739
(Episode 2: Revenge)

646
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:53,809
- What is it? - What?

647
00:42:54,579 --> 00:42:56,909
Those are the episode titles until now.

648
00:42:57,710 --> 00:42:58,979
Our titles?

649
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:00,280
What's going on?

650
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:02,218
- What? - Seriously.

651
00:43:02,219 --> 00:43:03,288
(Episode 5: Competition, Episode 6: Growth)

652
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:04,718
(Episode 7: Promotion or Elimination, Episode 8: Rival)

653
00:43:04,719 --> 00:43:05,920
(Episode 9: Debut D-7)

654
00:43:11,289 --> 00:43:13,928
I lacked a lot of skills and was young...

655
00:43:13,929 --> 00:43:16,670
at the beginning of Universe Ticket.

656
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:23,039
(April 14, 2023, the 1st encounter with Universe Ticket)

657
00:43:23,139 --> 00:43:24,940
Are you nervous? You look tensed up.

658
00:43:25,639 --> 00:43:27,178
Something like this is a first for me.

659
00:43:27,179 --> 00:43:29,009
- Is this your first audition? - Yes.

660
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:30,078
(Nervousness and excitement of her first audition)

661
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:31,409
Please introduce yourself first.

662
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:33,678
- Gabi. - Hi.

663
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:35,419
- You grew up a lot. - I'm Park Gabi,

664
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:37,149
fourteen years old, half-Canadian...

665
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:38,589
- and half-Korean. - She's 14.

666
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:40,659
You grew so much, Gabi.

667
00:43:42,929 --> 00:43:44,329
Please introduce yourself.

668
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:49,468
- Hi. My name is Kotoko. - Stop!

669
00:43:49,469 --> 00:43:50,869
(It was awkward and embarrassing at first.)

670
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:55,900
(But how much they shined back then remains clear.)

671
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,209
(All from different places, )

672
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:03,280
(they have gathered into one Universe.)

673
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:06,919
(Their growth in the Universe)

674
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:10,489
My Korean skills...

675
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,960
have improved a lot.

676
00:44:14,019 --> 00:44:16,090
My Korean has gotten better.

677
00:44:16,929 --> 00:44:19,429
(Nana's first interview)

678
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:25,570
(Even giving a greeting was hard.)

679
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:29,269
(Now, she can easily speak her mind!)

680
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:35,179
(Talking clearly)

681
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:37,709
- Your Korean has improved a lot. - Thank you.

682
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:39,579
Nana has improved so much.

683
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:43,820
(Nana's Korean rival)

684
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:47,288
- I think it was wrong. I'm sorry. - Let's do it again.

685
00:44:47,289 --> 00:44:48,919
- "I think it was wrong." - How cute.

686
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,428
(She improved into a cuter version.)

687
00:44:50,429 --> 00:44:51,659
I, myself,

688
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:55,259
have grown as a whole.

689
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:58,299
That includes my appearance. I grew taller.

690
00:44:58,300 --> 00:44:59,869
Even my permanent teeth came out.

691
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:03,569
They were so small.

692
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:04,570
(Her teeth had a small presence in the first stage.)

693
00:45:04,571 --> 00:45:05,638
That was cute.

694
00:45:05,639 --> 00:45:07,280
Gosh, Seowon!

695
00:45:10,179 --> 00:45:11,808
(Seowon's smile filled up brightly.)

696
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:13,750
- You have all your teeth. - I know, right?

697
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,348
Oh, my goodness.

698
00:45:15,349 --> 00:45:17,249
- That's so adorable! - My gosh.

699
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:18,518
Your teeth came out.

700
00:45:18,519 --> 00:45:20,389
I also became...

701
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:23,460
more loyal and got much closer...

702
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:25,690
to the others.

703
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:29,929
Those feelings have grown a lot.

704
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:32,840
It was a nice and valuable period of time.

705
00:45:35,369 --> 00:45:39,880
I also think that this impacted me mentally.

706
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:43,550
Having other people as well as myself to support...

707
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:46,419
- my growth... - Yes.

708
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:49,719
Really helped me improve...

709
00:45:49,849 --> 00:45:52,749
the belief that I had in myself to achieve things...

710
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,889
that seemed like they're really far from reach.

711
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:03,500
(The girls came together and pursued the same dream.)

712
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:10,269
(They are about to take their last step to end the journey.)

713
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:13,439
I've been working hard until now.

714
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,808
I'll keep performing well just like I've been doing so far.

715
00:46:15,809 --> 00:46:18,050
So I will be the one that wins the PRISM Ticket.

716
00:46:18,409 --> 00:46:20,250
My goal is to make a debut.

717
00:46:20,449 --> 00:46:22,518
I will do my best, so there are no regrets.

718
00:46:22,519 --> 00:46:24,218
To reach Level P,

719
00:46:24,219 --> 00:46:27,190
I will pour my soul into the final performances.

720
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:30,388
I shine the most brightly on Universe Ticket.

721
00:46:30,389 --> 00:46:32,230
I'll show it to you on stage.

722
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:35,428
I will fly high with the PRISM Ticket.

723
00:46:35,429 --> 00:46:37,929
I will make sure to be promoted to Level P.

724
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,939
I hope there will be a miracle...

725
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:41,900
in the last phase of my Universe journey.

726
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:54,380
("Ticket to You")

727
00:48:47,929 --> 00:48:50,869
You're watching the live broadcast of Universe Ticket.

728
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:52,969
Road to PRISM.

729
00:48:53,099 --> 00:48:57,239
It's time to check the final results of the promotion status at last.

730
00:48:58,010 --> 00:48:59,879
Only 8 girls out of 16...

731
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:03,650
will be promoted to Level P and form...

732
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:05,510
a debut group.

733
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:10,289
I will now announce the name...

734
00:49:11,150 --> 00:49:12,719
of the debut group...

735
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:14,260
of Universe Ticket.

736
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:20,828
As their story began from the Universe,

737
00:49:20,829 --> 00:49:23,328
the name represents our wish to write the story together.

738
00:49:23,329 --> 00:49:25,400
The name of the group is UNIS.

739
00:49:26,599 --> 00:49:27,868
Please give them a round of applause.

740
00:49:27,869 --> 00:49:30,139
UNIS. Yes.

741
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:33,908
I wonder which eight girls will be writing the story...

742
00:49:33,909 --> 00:49:35,380
as UNIS.

743
00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:38,249
She was the first one...

744
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:41,178
to reach Level P, and it was decided she would debut.

745
00:49:41,179 --> 00:49:43,320
The first member of UNIS is...

746
00:49:44,119 --> 00:49:45,420
It's Elisia.

747
00:49:47,059 --> 00:49:49,759
Elisia. Pass through the PRISM Road,

748
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:53,159
and head to the Debut Area.

749
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,230
Everyone, let's give her a big hand.

750
00:49:57,329 --> 00:50:00,368
(The first debut member, Elisia)

751
00:50:00,369 --> 00:50:02,439
Elisia garnered attention with her superb singing skills...

752
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:03,939
and incredible talent.

753
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:06,940
In the 1st and 2nd promotion ceremonies,

754
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:09,209
she received the most votes from Fan Ticketing.

755
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:11,849
She became the first final member of UNIS.

756
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,579
Congratulations once again!

757
00:50:18,989 --> 00:50:22,018
All right. Only 15 girls remain now.

758
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:24,058
Only seven girls...

759
00:50:24,059 --> 00:50:26,699
can walk through the PRISM Road.

760
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:28,400
I will now...

761
00:50:28,699 --> 00:50:32,928
announce those who will be promoted to the next level...

762
00:50:32,929 --> 00:50:35,969
through Unicorn Ticketing.

763
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:39,440
I will begin with Team "Miracle,"

764
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:41,178
the winning team of the Arranged Song Performance.

765
00:50:41,179 --> 00:50:43,679
Who will advance with Unicorn Ticketing?

766
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:49,420
Unicorn Se Jeong will name her.

767
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,619
Someone from Team "Miracle" will advance...

768
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:59,260
with Unicorn Ticketing from the Final Station. Her name is...

769
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,899
She perfectly executed all the highlights of the songs...

770
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:05,769
and made them her own.

771
00:51:07,139 --> 00:51:09,670
It's Bang Yunha. Congratulations.

772
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:12,239
Congratulations, Yunha.

773
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:15,010
Please stand on the platform.

774
00:51:20,519 --> 00:51:22,819
Yunha was in Level R.

775
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:25,618
With Unicorn Ticketing, she's promoted to the next level...

776
00:51:25,619 --> 00:51:28,190
which is Level P. Congratulations!

777
00:51:30,489 --> 00:51:33,829
She is the second debut member.

778
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:35,860
Please tell us how you feel.

779
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,729
First of all...

780
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:41,299
(Bang Yunha of Team "Miracle," Unicorn Ticketing)

781
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:42,500
Actually,

782
00:51:42,769 --> 00:51:46,808
before our performance...

783
00:51:46,809 --> 00:51:49,408
and before meeting the fans in person like this,

784
00:51:49,409 --> 00:51:52,279
I couldn't believe that I was here...

785
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:54,349
at the Final Station.

786
00:51:54,579 --> 00:52:00,190
I was part of this show, Universe Ticket, for a long time.

787
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:02,719
And now that the show is coming to an end...

788
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:06,459
I only thought about this, but it's actually happening now.

789
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:10,469
On top of that, I was chosen as a debut member.

790
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:13,598
So I really want to thank all of my fans...

791
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:16,469
for the votes. Thank you so much.

792
00:52:16,539 --> 00:52:18,570
I will continue to work hard...

793
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:21,238
and show you a new side of me...

794
00:52:21,239 --> 00:52:23,409
as a member of UNIS.

795
00:52:23,579 --> 00:52:24,749
Thank you.

796
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:26,409
All right. Let's give it up for Yunha.

797
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:28,779
Yunha, follow the PRISM Road,

798
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:30,920
and go to the Debut Area.

799
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:33,959
She has excellent skills and good stage etiquette...

800
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,658
like professional idol stars.

801
00:52:35,659 --> 00:52:37,690
Yunha is an all-rounder.

802
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:39,559
Her dream of making a debut has come true.

803
00:52:39,659 --> 00:52:42,699
I would like to congratulate you from the bottom of my heart again.

804
00:52:45,469 --> 00:52:47,300
All right. Next,

805

Team "DOPAMINE" won the New Song Performance.

806
00:52:51,809 --> 00:52:53,578
We will now check the contestant...

807
00:52:53,579 --> 00:52:55,380
who will be promoted with Unicorn Ticketing.

808
00:52:56,110 --> 00:52:59,849
Unicorn Younha. Please name the contestant.

809
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:03,249
All right. Throughout this journey,

810
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:04,948
she had always maintained a good balance...

811
00:53:04,949 --> 00:53:06,690
in the center of the performance.

812
00:53:07,590 --> 00:53:11,090
The contestant from Team "DOPAMINE" will get promoted. Her name is...

813
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:13,929

814
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,729
Congratulations, Nana.

815
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:18,070
Please stand on the platform.

816
00:53:19,769 --> 00:53:22,170
All right. She must be over the moon.

00:53:22,869 --> 00:53:24,509
Nana was in Level R.

818
00:53:24,510 --> 00:53:27,038

(Nana of Team "DOPAMINE," Unicorn Ticketing)

827
00:53:54,739 --> 00:53:57,440
Right now,

828
00:53:57,510 --> 00:54:01,038
I'm trying out to be a singer in Korea.

829
00:54:01,039 --> 00:54:05,849
Being on a Korean TV show had been a huge challenge for me.

830
00:54:06,110 --> 00:54:08,150
So I was quite insecure.

831
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:13,589
Then I got to meet you guys in person today.

832
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:19,629
I didn't know there were this many people...

833
00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:22,959
who were rooting for me. I'm happy to learn...

834
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,269
I have many people supporting me.

835
00:54:25,570 --> 00:54:29,440
I will keep showing cool performances.

836
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:31,768
Please support me. Thank you.

837
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:33,139
All right. Great.

838
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:37,179
Follow the PRISM Road, and go to the Debut Area.

839
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:39,678
Even the Unicorns acknowledged Nana...

840
00:54:39,679 --> 00:54:42,319
as the master of intros and the ending fairy.

841
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,689
Her dream of debuting as a K-pop girl group came true.

842
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:46,889
Let's give her a big hand again!

843
00:54:51,130 --> 00:54:55,630
All right. Now, three members of UNIS have been decided.

844
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Only five spots remain in the Debut Area.

845

00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:06,739
Now,

848
00:55:06,809 --> 00:55:11,010
it's time to check the results of Fan Ticketing.

849
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:13,780
As for the final round of Fan Ticketing,

850
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:15,679

Actually, when I started Universe Ticket,

878
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,199
I wasn't sure.

879
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,439

bring joy to you.

00:58:24,409 --> 00:58:27,280
Let's check her final level.

902
00:58:32,110 --> 00:58:37,348
Let's see. Will she be able to become the fifth member of UNIS?

903
00:58:37,349 --> 00:58:38,389
Lim Seowon!

904
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:42,159
- Keep going! - Let's go!

905
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:44,289
- What's the result? - Don't stop!

906
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:46,158
Keep going!

907
00:58:46,159 --> 00:58:47,199
She's almost there!

908
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,999
Congratulations!

909
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,538
She's become the fifth member of UNIS.

910
00:58:54,539 --> 00:58:55,699
Lim Seowon!

911
00:58:56,969 --> 00:58:59,409
She seems very shocked by the result.

912
00:58:59,510 --> 00:59:00,609
This is really happening.

913
00:59:00,610 --> 00:59:02,940
Please tell us how you feel.

914
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:05,779
(Lim Seowon, 559,943 points)

915
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:10,589
I only thought about trying out to become an idol singer.

916
00:59:10,590 --> 00:59:13,420
I really had no idea that I could be able to debut as one.

917
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:16,859
I would like to thank my family,

918
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:18,789
friends, and teachers for their support.

919
00:59:19,090 --> 00:59:21,428
I would like to thank my fans...

920
00:59:21,429 --> 00:59:24,429
for their votes and encouragement.

921
00:59:24,730 --> 00:59:27,198
As my journey on Universe Ticket comes to an end,

922
00:59:27,199 --> 00:59:30,439
a new journey as an idol singer will unfold.

923
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:32,869
Please join me on my journey.

924
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:35,110
All right. Great.

925
00:59:35,579 --> 00:59:37,550
- Thank you! - All right.

926
00:59:38,010 --> 00:59:42,079
Follow the PRISM Road, and go to the Debut Area.

927
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:45,549
She clearly showed her beauty, skills, and potential to be a star.

928
00:59:45,550 --> 00:59:47,988
Lim Seowon is nicknamed the Perfect Idol.

929
00:59:47,989 --> 00:59:52,288
She received a total of 559,943 points.

930
00:59:52,289 --> 00:59:55,000
She proudly became a member of the debut group.

931
00:59:55,159 --> 00:59:57,299
Please give her another big round of applause.

932
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:59,800
- Congratulations! - Congratulations!

933
01:00:01,469 --> 01:00:05,909
Let's continue. Contestant Oh Yoona, please stand on the platform.

934
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,679
In the last Promotion Ceremony,

935
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:16,779
she was promoted to Level R solely based on Fan Ticketing.

936
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:19,619
She now has a chance to make a debut.

937
01:00:20,519 --> 01:00:23,159
Let's check the final level...

938
01:00:24,130 --> 01:00:25,190
of Oh Yoona.

939
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:36,670
Let's see.

940
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:41,579
Will she be able to become the sixth member of UNIS?

941
01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:46,908
Congratulations!

942
01:00:46,909 --> 01:00:51,789
Oh Yoona has become the sixth debut member of UNIS.

943
01:00:52,949 --> 01:00:54,019
All right.

944
01:00:55,989 --> 01:00:58,889
She's in tears now.

945
01:00:59,559 --> 01:01:01,959
Yes. You can cry all you want today.

946
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:03,030
Don't cry!

947
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:05,429
Today is your day, Yoona.

948
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:08,268
Once you calm down a bit,

949
01:01:08,269 --> 01:01:10,340
- share with us how you feel. - Congratulations!

950
01:01:10,769 --> 01:01:12,738
(Oh Yoona)

951
01:01:12,739 --> 01:01:14,309
Her parents must be so happy.

952
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:19,510
If you can, please tell us how you feel.

953
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:23,249
I was 1 of the 82 girls in the beginning.

954
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:26,518
I really didn't think I could be able to make a debut.

955
01:01:26,519 --> 01:01:28,388
Thank you for giving me...

956
01:01:28,389 --> 01:01:30,260
this big opportunity of joining the debut group.

957
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:32,328
I would like to thank...

958
01:01:32,329 --> 01:01:34,229
the CEO of Star On Entertainment, Lee Jin Young,

959
01:01:34,230 --> 01:01:35,629
and everyone from my agency for their support.

960
01:01:35,630 --> 01:01:38,730
I would like to thank the staff of Universe Ticket.

961
01:01:38,929 --> 01:01:41,038
I want to thank my fans...

962
01:01:41,039 --> 01:01:44,209
for believing in me and voting for me.

963
01:01:44,210 --> 01:01:46,539
Mom. Dad. I love you!

964
01:01:48,179 --> 01:01:49,578
(Oh Yoona)

965
01:01:49,579 --> 01:01:50,908
- Thank you. - All right.

966
01:01:50,909 --> 01:01:53,348
Yoona gave us such a lovely speech.

967
01:01:53,349 --> 01:01:56,820
Yoona. Follow the PRISM Road, and go to the Debut Area.

968
01:01:58,550 --> 01:02:00,589
She had the most passion for her performances,

969
01:02:00,590 --> 01:02:02,888
the strongest will, and the most intense competitiveness.

970
01:02:02,889 --> 01:02:06,888
She received a total of 472,180 points.

971
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:09,499
She joined the debut group, UNIS.

972
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:12,030
We'll look forward to your future performances.

973
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:18,639
As for the next contestant whose level we will check,

974
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:20,980
it's Kotoko.

975
01:02:21,309 --> 01:02:22,739
Please stand on the platform.

976
01:02:25,579 --> 01:02:27,379
All right, Kotoko.

977
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:29,979
She left a strong impression from the very beginning.

978
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:32,189
She was always in the running for the debut group.

979
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:36,360
Will she be able to get promoted to Level P?

980
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:40,760
Let's check the final results of Kotoko.

981
01:02:42,530 --> 01:02:43,599
Good luck!

982
01:02:44,630 --> 01:02:46,129
You're so cute!

983
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:47,599
- You got this! - Good luck!

984
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:55,239
You're the best!

985
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:57,109
It's going up.

986
01:02:57,110 --> 01:03:01,649
Let's see. Will she be able to take the one of the last two spots?

987
01:03:01,650 --> 01:03:02,679
Kotoko.

988
01:03:05,719 --> 01:03:07,919
Congratulations, Kotoko!

989
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:10,788
You're promoted to Level P.

990
01:03:10,789 --> 01:03:13,189
It is decided that you will debut.

991
01:03:13,190 --> 01:03:14,599
(Kotoko)

992
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:17,328
All right. She seems very surprised.

993
01:03:17,329 --> 01:03:20,840
Please tell us how you feel.

994
01:03:23,769 --> 01:03:25,010
To be honest...

995
01:03:25,769 --> 01:03:27,979
To be honest...

996
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:29,709
(Kotoko, 470,502 points)

997
01:03:29,710 --> 01:03:31,979
I wasn't confident.

998
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:33,010
But...

999
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:39,889
I had fans who voted for me.

1000
01:03:40,289 --> 01:03:41,460
So...

1001
01:03:42,260 --> 01:03:45,690
I am able to make a debut now.

1002
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:46,889
But...

1003
01:03:47,659 --> 01:03:49,300
I...

1004
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:56,300
There are some parts I still feel insecure about.

1005
01:03:57,340 --> 01:03:59,409
But I will work hard.

1006
01:03:59,809 --> 01:04:00,879
Thank you.

1007
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:03,178
All right. Let's give her a big round of applause.

1008
01:04:03,179 --> 01:04:06,380
Follow the PRISM Road, and go to the Debut Area.

1009
01:04:06,849 --> 01:04:09,480
Kotoko is the seventh member of UNIS.

1010
01:04:10,349 --> 01:04:11,988
As she continued to show improvement throughout the show,

1011
01:04:11,989 --> 01:04:13,649
she won over the global fans.

1012
01:04:13,650 --> 01:04:17,988
With a total of 470,502 points, she has joined the debut group.

1013
01:04:17,989 --> 01:04:19,030
Congratulations!

1014
01:04:21,159 --> 01:04:23,460
- Congratulations! - Kotoko!

1015
01:04:26,329 --> 01:04:28,099
All right. Now,

1016
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:31,308
- No! - only one spot...

1017
01:04:31,309 --> 01:04:32,510
Let's make a debut!

1018
01:04:32,670 --> 01:04:34,409
Remains in the group.

1019
01:04:35,079 --> 01:04:36,839
- Oh, no. - Yeram!

1020
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:37,979
Oh, no.

1021
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:40,408
The last contestant in Level R...

1022
01:04:40,409 --> 01:04:42,848
is waiting for her result.

1023
01:04:42,849 --> 01:04:47,559
If Sumin were to take the last spot,

1024
01:04:48,289 --> 01:04:52,690
everyone in Level R would have joined UNIS.

1025
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:56,530
All right. Sumin is the last contestant in Level R.

1026
01:04:59,070 --> 01:05:00,698
Let's check her final level.

1027
01:05:00,699 --> 01:05:02,139
Please stand on the platform.

1028
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:07,308
Sumin...

1029
01:05:07,309 --> 01:05:08,779
got close to the debut team...

1030
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:10,210
for the 1st time in the 2nd Promotion Ceremony.

1031
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:12,279
Will she be able to continue the momentum...

1032
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:14,118
and have another successful round of Fan Ticketing?

1033
01:05:14,119 --> 01:05:16,780
Will she be able to be promoted to Level P?

1034
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:19,690
Show us...

1035
01:05:20,550 --> 01:05:21,659
her final level!

1036
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:29,960
All right. Let's see.

1037
01:05:30,969 --> 01:05:34,670
Will everyone in Level R be able to join the debut group,

1038
01:05:35,269 --> 01:05:37,368
UNIS, as expected?

1039
01:05:37,369 --> 01:05:39,139
Here's the final level for Sumin.

1040
01:05:40,739 --> 01:05:41,780
Good luck!

1041
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:44,110
You can make a debut too!

1042
01:05:44,579 --> 01:05:45,610
Let's go!

1043
01:05:46,550 --> 01:05:47,849
All right, it's going up.

1044
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:53,949
Kim Sumin.

1045
01:05:54,159 --> 01:05:57,888
With a total score of 291,959 points,

1046
01:05:57,889 --> 01:06:01,259
which is 50.7 percent of Level R,

1047
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:04,599
she failed to get promoted to Level P.

1048
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,669
The fact that she got so close to the debut team last time...

1049
01:06:07,670 --> 01:06:11,539
makes this even more disappointing.

1050
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:15,109
Everyone, let's give her a big round of applause.

1051
01:06:15,110 --> 01:06:17,780
- You did great! - Good job!

1052
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:22,420
Since we're pressed for time,

1053
01:06:22,550 --> 01:06:24,849
I'll have Sumin return to her seat now.

1054
01:06:26,389 --> 01:06:28,889
Your dreams will soon come true.

1055
01:06:34,460 --> 01:06:36,029
All right. Now,

1056
01:06:36,030 --> 01:06:39,670
seven contestants have made the debut team so far.

1057
01:06:39,769 --> 01:06:42,239
There is only one spot left.

1058
01:06:42,969 --> 01:06:46,669
Now, the Level I contestants are given a chance...

1059
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:49,179
to make their debut.

1060
01:06:49,809 --> 01:06:53,409
Who will be the last member of UNIS?

1061
01:06:55,019 --> 01:06:57,849
The contestant who's ranked the highest on Level I,

1062
01:06:58,289 --> 01:07:01,860
Lee Sunwoo. Please come up to the platform.

1063
01:07:02,019 --> 01:07:03,559
- Let's go! - Go!

1064
01:07:05,690 --> 01:07:06,960
You can do it!

1065
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:09,058
Through the Fan Ticketing,

1066
01:07:09,059 --> 01:07:12,130
Lee Sunwoo remained high in the ranking.

1067
01:07:13,630 --> 01:07:17,269
Let's check her final level.

1068
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:32,889
Let's see. Will Lee Sunwoo...

1069
01:07:34,090 --> 01:07:36,219
be able to join UNIS?

1070
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:42,230
Go! One more time!

1071
01:07:42,329 --> 01:07:43,530
You can do it!

1072
01:07:43,630 --> 01:07:45,429
She has reached Level R.

1073
01:07:45,730 --> 01:07:46,730
Come on!

1074
01:07:52,539 --> 01:07:53,670
Well...

1075
01:07:55,579 --> 01:07:56,609
(She's eliminated with a total score of 398,374 points.)

1076
01:07:56,610 --> 01:07:58,150
Contestant Lee Sunwoo.

1077
01:07:58,510 --> 01:08:03,719
With a total score of 398,374 points,

1078
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:08,459
which is 83.9 percent of Level R,

1079
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:11,590
she failed to get promoted to Level P.

1080
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:16,159
Sunwoo showed such great passion for the stage through her hard work.

1081
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:19,100
It's such a shame. Let's give her a big hand.

1082
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:22,438
Sunwoo, you can also...

1083
01:08:22,439 --> 01:08:24,710
- Sunwoo, you're beautiful! - You were great!

1084
01:08:24,869 --> 01:08:27,409
You can return to your seat now.

1085
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:29,079
Good job!

1086
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:31,250
- We love you, Sunwoo! - We love you, Sunwoo!

1087
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:38,019
The number of the remaining spot on the debut team...

1088
01:08:38,020 --> 01:08:39,550
is still one.

1089
01:08:39,989 --> 01:08:42,590
Who will secure the last spot?

1090
01:08:43,159 --> 01:08:46,430
Next up is Jin Hyeonju. Please step up on the platform.

1091
01:08:52,869 --> 01:08:54,568
Will Jin Hyeonju...

1092
01:08:54,569 --> 01:08:58,409
be able to take the last spot on the debut team?

1093
01:08:59,369 --> 01:09:02,340
What's Jin Hyeonju's final level?

1094
01:09:05,779 --> 01:09:07,010
We'll be back with the result...

1095
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:10,380
in a moment.

1096
01:09:15,460 --> 01:09:18,159
- Let's go! - You got this!

1097
01:09:18,859 --> 01:09:20,630
- Bae Haram! - Let's go!

1098
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,368
The announcement of the last member of UNIS is all there is left now.

1099
01:09:24,369 --> 01:09:27,969
You're watching SBS global girl group debut project,

1100
01:09:27,970 --> 01:09:30,939
Universe Ticket, and this is the Final Station.

1101
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:35,140
Only one spot remains on the debut team now.

1102
01:09:36,409 --> 01:09:38,250
Will Jin Hyeonju...

1103
01:09:38,479 --> 01:09:41,619
be the last member of the debut team?

1104
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:44,890
What's her final level?

1105
01:09:46,189 --> 01:09:47,250
Let's see it!

1106
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:53,829
- You can do it! - Go!

1107
01:09:57,159 --> 01:09:58,369
Let's go!

1108
01:10:02,539 --> 01:10:04,100
- You can do it! - You can do it!

1109
01:10:04,270 --> 01:10:05,439
Keep going!

1110
01:10:09,510 --> 01:10:12,809
She has reached Level R without difficulty.

1111
01:10:12,810 --> 01:10:14,749
(Jin Hyeonju)

1112
01:10:14,750 --> 01:10:16,319
- You can do it! - You can do it!

1113
01:10:19,090 --> 01:10:21,920
How far will she go?

1114
01:10:22,359 --> 01:10:24,829
Will she be the last member?

1115
01:10:28,060 --> 01:10:29,429
Contestant Jin Hyeonju!

1116
01:10:29,430 --> 01:10:33,229
She has been promoted to Level P!

1117
01:10:34,270 --> 01:10:37,868
She secured the last spot and became the last member of UNIS!

1118
01:10:37,869 --> 01:10:38,939
Congratulations!

1119
01:10:41,510 --> 01:10:44,350
Please tell us how you feel.

1120
01:10:46,550 --> 01:10:49,879
I really didn't expect this,

1121
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:51,849
and I'm completely thrown off right now.

1122
01:10:51,850 --> 01:10:55,420
First of all, in my entire time on Universe Ticket,

1123
01:10:55,689 --> 01:10:58,189
I never won until today. I had my first victory.

1124
01:10:58,989 --> 01:11:00,788
And now...

1125
01:11:00,789 --> 01:11:03,459
(Jin Hyeonju, Total: 496,797 points)

1126
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:07,000
Thank you so much for giving me such a wonderful opportunity.

1127
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,970
I will work hard. Thank you.

1128
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,969
All right. Congratulations again.

1129
01:11:12,970 --> 01:11:14,510
Please follow the PRISM Road...

1130
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:17,478
and take the last spot.

1131
01:11:17,479 --> 01:11:19,350
Let's congratulate her with a big hand.

1132
01:11:23,180 --> 01:11:24,419
Jin Hyeonju has...

1133
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:27,288
solid skills, soft charisma, and good leadership.

1134
01:11:27,289 --> 01:11:30,059
Showing an upswing in the final Fan Ticketing,

1135
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:34,259
she scored 496,797 points in total...

1136
01:11:34,260 --> 01:11:36,898
and miraculously secured her debut.

1137
01:11:36,899 --> 01:11:38,430
Congratulations again.

1138
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:42,068
All right. The debut team of Universe Ticket,

1139
01:11:42,069 --> 01:11:44,469
UNIS, has been formed.

1140
01:11:44,470 --> 01:11:47,470
Let me call their names 1 by 1.

1141
01:11:47,569 --> 01:11:49,710
First, Elisia.

1142
01:11:49,779 --> 01:11:51,749

Congratulations on your debut!

1154
01:12:29,850 --> 01:12:32,619
Let's congratulate them with a big hand once again.

1155
01:12:38,529 --> 01:12:41,728
All right. The eight members of UNIS will have...

1156
01:12:41,729 --> 01:12:43,960
the entire world as their stage.

1157
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:47,699
Please continue giving them a lot of love and support.

1158
01:12:47,970 --> 01:12:52,109
Also, to those who sadly didn't make the debut team...

1159
01:12:52,369 --> 01:12:55,578
despite their hard work to achieve their dreams,

1160
01:12:55,579 --> 01:12:58,879
please give a big round of applause to show support and encouragement.

1161

We support your dreams, guys.

1163
01:13:05,119 --> 01:13:06,920
They will soon come true.

1164
01:13:12,229 --> 01:13:15,228
Now, Universe Ticket's journey...

1165
01:13:15,229 --> 01:13:18,029
ends here.
