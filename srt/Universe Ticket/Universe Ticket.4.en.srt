(This program is a story of girls of different worlds with one dream.)

2
00:00:03,612 --> 00:00:05,342
(This program is a story of girls of different worlds...)

3
00:00:05,342 --> 00:00:07,082
(heading toward one Universe.)

4
00:00:07,082 --> 00:00:12,083
(Republic of Korea)

5
00:00:12,083 --> 00:00:13,952

(Philippines)

8
00:00:16,493 --> 00:00:17,592
(Canada, France)

9
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,191
To be a part of a K-pop girl group,

10
00:00:19,191 --> 00:00:22,391
a total of 82 girls gathered in Korea.

11
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,961
Out of these 82 girls,

12
00:00:24,961 --> 00:00:28,130
only eight girls will head to the final global stage.

13
00:00:28,801 --> 00:00:32,100
The reason I'm here and why I dreamed of joining a girl group.

14
00:00:32,501 --> 00:00:35,941
I want to completely know who I am and play to my strengths.

15
00:00:35,941 --> 00:00:37,310
I want to show all of those parts.

16
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:39,140
Please get...

17
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,450
(Make sure to reserve a ticket...)

18
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,151
(for the 82 girls from all over the world.)

19
00:00:45,151 --> 00:00:46,520
Please get...

20
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,820
- Tickets to our dreams. - Tickets to our dreams.

21
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,450
(Universe Ticket)

22
00:00:51,221 --> 00:00:54,020
All 82 global girls, welcome.

23
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,361
(82 girls gathered with the same dream.)

24
00:00:57,691 --> 00:00:58,761
I'm so nervous.

25
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,230
(The excitement of their first encounter did not last long.)

26
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,770
(The start of an intense competition, Battle Week)

27
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:06,341
The 7-day Battle Week will start today.

28
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,540
After two battles,

29
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:13,740
half of 82 girls will be eliminated.

30
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,781
What?

31
00:01:15,611 --> 00:01:16,611
No way!

32
00:01:19,051 --> 00:01:20,451
(The first stage of survival)

33
00:01:20,451 --> 00:01:21,990
(1-on-1 Battle)

34
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,051
My goodness!

35
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:24,891
(I have to do whatever it takes.)

36
00:01:26,161 --> 00:01:27,221
(Not everyone can survive.)

37
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:29,490
(That was so good.)

38
00:01:30,861 --> 00:01:33,230
(I believe I have more skills.)

39
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,570
(A close match that cannot be predictable)

40
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:38,801
(How do we choose?)

41
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,801
(Does this show not have a free pass?)

42
00:01:41,941 --> 00:01:45,111
(I will show everyone how threatening the 2nd-placer can be.)

43
00:01:45,111 --> 00:01:46,480
(I will make sure to win.)

44
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,911
(Something is wrong.)

45
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:52,451
(Something is surely wrong.)

46
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,320
(Do you want to continue with this profession?)

47
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:58,290
(An idol singer must present a perfect performance.)

48
00:01:58,661 --> 00:02:00,020
(Even if it's lacking,)

49
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,460
(it must be completed.)

50
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,360
(The winners and losers decided by the 1-on-1 Battle)

51
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,771
(11th Elisia: 3, 73rd Yukino: 2)

52
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:16,311
(33rd An Seungbi: 3, 49th Oh Yoona: 2)

53
00:02:17,441 --> 00:02:18,941
(I felt wronged.)

54
00:02:18,941 --> 00:02:20,540
(I performed everything live.)

55
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:25,281
(She performed separately for dancing and singing.)

56
00:02:25,281 --> 00:02:27,320
In the next battle...

57
00:02:28,521 --> 00:02:30,850
(I will definitely win.)

58
00:02:31,591 --> 00:02:34,991
(The winners and losers are separated by uniform colors.)

59
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,061
(All my roommates looked like Barbies.)

60
00:02:39,061 --> 00:02:44,330
(I looked like a character from "Squid Game.")

61
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,540
(Everyone could see who the winners and losers are.)

62
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,741
(It hurt my pride, and I wanted to get my revenge.)

63
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,781
(The final stage to head to the Universe.)

64
00:02:54,781 --> 00:02:58,281
(Revenge Battle)

65
00:02:58,281 --> 00:03:00,121
(The Revenge Battle will be a team battle.)

66
00:03:00,121 --> 00:03:01,580
(Winners versus...)

67
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,021
(Challengers)

68
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,621
(Hold on.)

69
00:03:05,621 --> 00:03:06,691
(I'm so excited.)

70
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,591
(Let me get my revenge.)

71
00:03:09,591 --> 00:03:11,630
(The fact that I had a chance to get my revenge...)

72
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,760
(motivated me with a bigger sense of passion.)

73
00:03:15,471 --> 00:03:18,100
(The Challengers who want to get their revenge)

74
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:21,140
(The Winners who must protect their win)

75
00:03:21,871 --> 00:03:24,341
(The Revenge Battle starts.)

76
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,580
(I wasn't really worried.)

77
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,241
(I am very confident.)

78
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,450
(I will win no matter what.)

79
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:32,751
(A chance for revenge has come.)

80
00:03:33,121 --> 00:03:35,691
(I must win this time.)

81
00:03:35,691 --> 00:03:38,591
(I will show you what true revenge is.)

82
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,191
("Tell Me" by Cute Challengers of 6 different countries)

83
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,390
(Perfect "TT" performance by Cute Winners of the aces)

84
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,640
The winning team of the cute concept is...

85
00:03:52,971 --> 00:03:55,241
(Winners' win)

86
00:03:55,371 --> 00:03:57,341
- Thank you. - Thank you.

87
00:03:58,411 --> 00:04:00,311
(The Pure Winners showed perfect choreography...)

88
00:04:00,311 --> 00:04:02,181
(with "Into The New World.")

89
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,721
(The Winners take consecutive wins.)

90
00:04:11,091 --> 00:04:13,091
Why are you crying?

91
00:04:13,821 --> 00:04:16,230
(The Enchanting concept came next...)

92
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,591
(while the Challengers were trailing.)

93
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:22,930
(I want the direct advancement to the Universe.)

94
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:26,040
(You're nothing against me.)

95
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,810
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, coming!

96
00:04:29,271 --> 00:04:34,881
(The Winners' "Mister" showed how relaxed they were.)

97
00:04:34,881 --> 00:04:39,521
(I really gritted my teeth for this revenge match.)

98
00:04:39,521 --> 00:04:41,420
(I will win.)

99
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:52,860
(The Challengers' "DIVA" was full of spite.)

100
00:04:54,401 --> 00:04:56,430
I believe...

101
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,831
(I believe...)

102
00:04:57,831 --> 00:05:00,870
(the center of this battle had to be Yoona.)

103
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,040
The winning team of the Enchanting concept is...

104
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:10,381
(The Enchanting Challengers got their first revenge.)

105
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:14,680
(The first win for the Challengers)

106
00:05:15,721 --> 00:05:17,591
(They didn't choose the team or the song,)

107
00:05:17,591 --> 00:05:19,591
(but they managed to win.)

108
00:05:20,461 --> 00:05:21,891
(Incredible)

109
00:05:21,891 --> 00:05:25,230
(This is why it's a revenge match.)

110
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,201
(The Sparkling Challengers dream of another upset.)

111
00:05:34,771 --> 00:05:37,571
(The head is full of spite.)

112
00:05:38,011 --> 00:05:42,040
(It didn't feel like a performance by the Challengers.)

113
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,310
(I will get my revenge on Yeojin.)

114
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,281
(Good luck with that.)

115
00:05:50,321 --> 00:05:52,021
(A hot performance by the Sparkling Winners...)

116
00:05:52,021 --> 00:05:53,021
(that will show their dignity as winners.)

117
00:05:53,021 --> 00:05:54,360
(I can't choose.)

118
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:55,930
(This one's hard.)

119
00:05:58,461 --> 00:05:59,500
(They're good.)

120
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,800
The winning team of the Sparkling concept is...

121
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,631
(Can the Challengers get their revenge?)

122
00:06:06,971 --> 00:06:07,971
They look great.

123
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,440
(The last Revenge Battle)

124
00:06:15,951 --> 00:06:18,381
(Charisma)

125
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:21,521
(Why are they so pretty?)

126
00:06:21,521 --> 00:06:23,091
(Challengers versus...)

127
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,490
(Winners)

128
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,990
(The Charismatic concept started a legendary battle.)

129
00:06:32,701 --> 00:06:33,800
(I got goosebumps.)

130
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,930
(I get why this is the last battle.)

131
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:38,071
(I can't choose. What do I do?)

132
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,201
(Additionally...)

133
00:06:43,911 --> 00:06:46,011
The contestant to advance to the Universe is...

134
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:49,511
(The 41 girls of the Universe will be revealed.)

135
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:53,350
(Episode 4: Ticket)

136
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:56,721
Next, we'll have the Sparkling Winners to come up.

137
00:06:56,721 --> 00:06:58,821
- Hello. - Hello.

138
00:06:58,821 --> 00:07:00,190
You can do it!

139
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,261
- How pretty! - They're so pretty.

140
00:07:02,391 --> 00:07:04,031
Their outfits are so pretty.

141
00:07:04,031 --> 00:07:06,161
They're dressed in red.

142
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:11,800
(The representative sparkling song of the summer, "Red Flavor")

143
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,240
For this song,

144
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,141
there's an explosive part toward the end.

145
00:07:17,141 --> 00:07:19,411
The "Red Flavor" performance.

146
00:07:19,411 --> 00:07:22,511
I think I could pull it off really well...

147
00:07:22,511 --> 00:07:24,911
because it's a very refreshing stage.

148
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,151
(Elisia volunteered for the highlight part.)

149
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,190
That was really good.

150
00:07:35,961 --> 00:07:38,290
I love Elisia!

151
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,201
- I really do. - Thank you.

152
00:07:41,201 --> 00:07:43,771
My refreshing charm...

153
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,040
with that highlight part.

154
00:07:48,841 --> 00:07:51,911
With my smile and eyes.

155
00:07:53,381 --> 00:07:55,381
Part Five for the main rapper.

156
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,480
- I want to take it. - Me.

157
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,480
There are two? Okay.

158
00:07:59,281 --> 00:08:03,091
(The first volunteer, Leader Kim Chaewon)

159
00:08:03,821 --> 00:08:07,490
(The second volunteer, Thailand's Oukikk)

160
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,490
Raise your hands for Chaewon.

161
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,831
(Kim Chaewon gets 4 votes.)

162
00:08:11,831 --> 00:08:13,261
Chaewon gets this part.

163
00:08:13,631 --> 00:08:14,961
(Kim Chaewon gets the main rap part.)

164
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:16,271
Thank you.

165
00:08:16,901 --> 00:08:18,230
I will do my best.

166
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,901
- Okay. - Okay. Please show us.

167
00:08:19,901 --> 00:08:21,071
Unfortunately...

168
00:08:21,071 --> 00:08:24,071
I didn't get the rap part, so...

169
00:08:24,071 --> 00:08:28,680
I was like, "Oh, my gosh. Which part should I do?"

170
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,651
(Oukikk participated as a dancer and rapper.)

171
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:38,090
(For the 1-on-1 Battle, she chose a hip-hop song.)

172
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:41,991
My voice isn't that high.

173
00:08:41,991 --> 00:08:44,231
And this song is kind of high.

174
00:08:44,231 --> 00:08:46,460
Yes. It's very high.

175
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,371
I think it'll be too hard.

176
00:08:55,371 --> 00:08:56,411
The notes are too...

177
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,511
What do we do?

178
00:09:01,881 --> 00:09:03,450
Is there a different part you want?

179
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:04,950
Can I try again for this part?

180
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,220
I really want it.

181
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,680
One more time?

182
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,690
I really want this part.

183
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,351
I really do.

184
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:15,960
I got the part, but she still really wanted it.

185
00:09:17,761 --> 00:09:18,761
No?

186
00:09:18,761 --> 00:09:20,861
(Kim Hyojin suggests a trade of parts.)

187
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:24,700
Not everyone can survive.

188
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,070
For me to win,

189
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:29,810
I must do something that I'm good at.

190
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:33,710
(In the end, Oukikk failed to get the main rap part.)

191
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:34,881
Goodness.

192
00:09:34,881 --> 00:09:37,710
It's okay.

193
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:40,381
It's okay. Crying will lock up your voice.

194
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:42,720
- The song is too hard. - It's okay.

195
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,320
That's right.

196
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,690
What can I do?

197
00:09:46,121 --> 00:09:48,060
It's still an individual battle within a team battle.

198
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,661
I'm sorry I ruined everything.

199
00:09:52,661 --> 00:09:54,131
- Not at all. - Not at all.

200
00:09:54,131 --> 00:09:57,531
I became the main rapper, but it feels like I stole it.

201
00:09:57,631 --> 00:10:02,040
It became more of an individual fight.

202
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,810
I was worried that it would hurt our teamwork.

203
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:13,550
It was really pressuring. I just pressured myself.

204
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,651
So I cried.

205
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:20,391
I thought the high-note part was so hard.

206
00:10:20,391 --> 00:10:22,261
The other people could do it.

207
00:10:22,261 --> 00:10:24,590
I thought they could do better than me.

208
00:10:26,261 --> 00:10:27,830
Oh, right.

209
00:10:28,101 --> 00:10:30,101
- Thank you. - The meaning...

210
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:35,371
It means, "You're my favorite summer," right?

211
00:10:35,371 --> 00:10:36,440
What?

212
00:10:36,911 --> 00:10:40,281
So you rest and stuff. And you feel really nice in summer.

213
00:10:40,281 --> 00:10:44,680
My favorite flavor, summer

214
00:10:44,851 --> 00:10:47,050
(Elisia helps with the individual parts.)

215
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:49,050
- That's good. - Oh, my gosh.

216
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:53,161
My favorite flavor

217
00:10:53,161 --> 00:10:54,290
Hey!

218
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,631
- That was good. - That was good.

219
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:59,060
Oh, my gosh.

220
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,001
I think I kind of pressured myself too much, so I...

221
00:11:02,001 --> 00:11:03,300
- Yes. - Yes.

222
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,470
You shouldn't be pressured because you're already really good.

223
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,540
Really? Love you!

224
00:11:11,011 --> 00:11:12,680
Peach!

225
00:11:13,611 --> 00:11:17,411
(Yu is another contestant with a rap part.)

226
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:23,851
The pronunciation is too hard for me.

227
00:11:24,391 --> 00:11:26,190
It's really hard.

228
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:28,560
The "jjaeng" and "maeng" words are really hard for me.

229
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:33,200
(These two words are in the lyrics.)

230
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:35,970
(The pronunciation is hard for the Japanese contestant.)

231
00:11:36,501 --> 00:11:40,501
I had to do it while dancing, so it was hard to keep the beat.

232
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:45,011
I was so frustrated with how bad I was.

233
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:53,151
I'm constantly practicing whenever I have time.

234
00:11:54,621 --> 00:11:58,690
(She even practices her rap part while in bed.)

235
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:03,131
(2 days before the Revenge Battle)

236
00:12:16,141 --> 00:12:18,710
Elisia, I think you should take out the improvisation.

237
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,440
- No improvising. - Okay.

238
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,450
It's better to remove it if it's not outstanding.

239
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,210
- Got it? - Okay.

240
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,981
I was really disappointed.

241
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:29,751
It also made me worried...

242
00:12:29,751 --> 00:12:31,690
because this was the first vocal lesson.

243
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:35,261
I didn't get to show my full potential.

244
00:12:35,261 --> 00:12:36,690
What's wrong?

245
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,460
- What's wrong? - You did really well.

246
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,031
Nothing.

247
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,531
I was better during practice by myself.

248
00:12:43,531 --> 00:12:44,800
- I see. - I see.

249
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:46,800
It's okay.

250
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,070
We're not done with everything today.

251
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:50,940
- We're going up on stage. - We're going up on stage.

252
00:12:51,411 --> 00:12:52,741
You're so talented.

253
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:54,810
You'll do much better on stage.

254
00:12:54,981 --> 00:12:56,011
Okay.

255
00:12:56,011 --> 00:12:57,310
Don't cry.

256
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,550
(1 day before the Revenge Battle)

257
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,550
- Hello. - Hello.

258
00:13:03,021 --> 00:13:06,391
(An interim check with Yeji and Chaeryeong of ITZY)

259
00:13:23,111 --> 00:13:26,781
The choreography is split into many parts.

260
00:13:26,781 --> 00:13:29,040
I think it'll be hard to perform this song live.

261
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,210
I think the notes are very high as well.

262
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:34,920
That must be why I felt...

263
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,190
the live performance to be unstable.

264
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:41,121
Everyone is dancing to a different beat.

265
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:44,531
The raise of hands was delayed like dominoes.

266
00:13:44,531 --> 00:13:47,101
I think that will hurt the flow of the song.

267
00:13:47,531 --> 00:13:49,570
We were out of sync.

268
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:51,970
That made me worry the most.

269
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:54,340
This was why it was more of a disappointment for me.

270
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:59,540
Considering the overall balance of the team,

271
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,741
everyone wants to...

272
00:14:01,911 --> 00:14:04,611
show something on their own.

273
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:07,420
Shall I say it's hard to focus on the overall picture?

274
00:14:09,121 --> 00:14:12,220
(Everyone was focused on their own part.)

275
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,231
(They did not spend enough time on their teamwork.)

276
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:21,031
It was disappointing.

277
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,731
What if we mess up tomorrow?

278
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,440
No. That won't happen.

279
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:35,310
Let's practice hard and do well tomorrow.

280
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:40,080
If I said that I'd work ten times harder, then...

281
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,151
I wanted to work...

282
00:14:43,151 --> 00:14:45,751
fifteen times harder or twenty times harder.

283
00:14:46,161 --> 00:14:48,190
All right. Focus.

284
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,631
Get yourselves together!

285
00:14:49,631 --> 00:14:51,761
- Get yourselves together! Let's go. - Get yourselves together!

286
00:14:51,761 --> 00:14:55,761
I want to show a smooth and complete song.

287
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:58,330
Because it's our stage.

288
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,001
It's not only my stage.

289
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:04,170
- Shall we take a look? - Okay.

290
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,241
(They become a team on their last night.)

291
00:15:05,241 --> 00:15:08,210
Okay. Great job.

292
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:10,180
I will brace myself.

293
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:13,220
I will make sure not to lose on stage with confidence.

294
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,720
Are you ready?

295
00:15:15,851 --> 00:15:17,290
- Are you ready? - Let's go.

296
00:15:22,661 --> 00:15:24,031
- I'm excited. - That's cool.

297
00:15:24,031 --> 00:15:25,531
I'm really excited.

298
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,131
- I'm excited. - I think they'll do well.

299
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,361
They're so pretty.

300
00:15:30,531 --> 00:15:33,300
("Red Flavor" by Red Velvet)

301
00:15:55,891 --> 00:15:56,930
They're good.

302
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,901
They're good.

303
00:16:24,491 --> 00:16:25,621
How cute!

304
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,981
Her pronunciation is really good!

305
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,280
That was amazing.

306
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,280
What a refreshing performance.

307
00:17:57,911 --> 00:17:59,051
Why are they so good?

308
00:18:00,051 --> 00:18:01,051
They're good.

309
00:18:01,051 --> 00:18:03,291
The two teams are neck-and-neck. They were both so good.

310
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:04,520
- They were great. - My goodness.

311
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:07,391
They improved so much so quickly. Oh, my.

312
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,490
- Thank you. - Thank you.

313
00:18:12,161 --> 00:18:15,200
I think the song was divided well for everyone.

314
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:19,371
Actually, I clearly remember Elisia's first performance.

315
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:21,641
You definitely had your presence in this performance...

316
00:18:21,641 --> 00:18:23,841
just like you did during your first performance.

317
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,641
Thank you.

318
00:18:28,411 --> 00:18:30,311
- And Yu. - Yes.

319
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,680
- You were superb. - Really?

320
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,351
Really. You were so good.

321
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,750
From your performance, I tasted some "red flavor."

322
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,791
I agree. I also enjoyed your performance.

323
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:43,131
Overall, everyone improved a lot...

324
00:18:43,131 --> 00:18:45,631
compared to the performances you did for the 1-on-1 Battle.

325
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:47,530
Your performance made me wonder if you were the same people.

326
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:49,401
That's how great you were today.

327
00:18:49,401 --> 00:18:52,230
Especially, Elisia and Yu...

328
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:56,101
perfectly practiced the directions of their gazes as well.

329
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,510
That made the performance feel vivid and helped me fully focus on them.

330
00:18:59,911 --> 00:19:01,081
Moreover,

331
00:19:01,081 --> 00:19:03,480
I was informed that you didn't have much time to practice.

332
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,710
So I would like to tell everyone that I appreciate your hard work.

333
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,920
I think you'll continue to improve. Thank you for the performance.

334
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,980
(They showed an amazing improvement over the short period of time.)

335
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,891
- Thank you. - Thank you.

336
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:18,131
I think Elisia and Yu are very good.

337
00:19:18,131 --> 00:19:19,361
- They're amazing. - Yes.

338
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:21,760
They help the others stay centered.

339
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,030
A few of them definitely stood out.

340
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,270
Right? Yes.

341
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:26,470
What are they going to do?

342
00:19:26,841 --> 00:19:28,371
Both teams were great.

343
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:33,841
- Seriously. This is so hard. - How can I...

344
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:35,341
- eliminate one of the teams? - Right.

345
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:36,710
This is so tough.

346
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,111
This is what happens in a competition.

347
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,291
Here are the battle results.

348
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:47,791
(The results of the Revenge Battle will be announced now.)

349
00:19:48,591 --> 00:19:49,791
Should we hold hands?

350
00:19:51,831 --> 00:19:54,101
- Gosh. - Goodness. I'm nervous.

351
00:19:55,101 --> 00:19:58,101
The winning team for the Sparkling concept is...

352
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,940
I think we'll get 3 votes, and the other team will get 2 votes.

353
00:20:06,141 --> 00:20:07,210
We did well.

354
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:11,411
We finished our performance strong, so I was hoping we would win.

355
00:20:13,551 --> 00:20:14,621
This is crazy.

356
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,420
They must be so nervous.

357
00:20:19,861 --> 00:20:22,490
(Which one of the teams will win the Sparkling concept?)

358
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:25,460
The winning team for the Sparkling concept is...

359
00:20:26,861 --> 00:20:28,760
Team Sparkling Challengers.

360
00:20:29,331 --> 00:20:31,930
(Team Sparkling Challengers wins the battle.)

361
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,970
- Thank you. - Thank you.

362
00:20:34,101 --> 00:20:36,141
- Thank you. - Thank you.

363
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:37,641
- With a score of 3 to 2, - Thank you.

364
00:20:37,641 --> 00:20:39,670
Team Sparkling Challengers won the battle.

365
00:20:39,841 --> 00:20:41,881
- It was neck and neck. - Totally.

366
00:20:43,151 --> 00:20:44,651
Why are you crying?

367
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,270
- Gosh. Oh, no. - Thank you.

368
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:06,331
I want to cry for them too.

369
00:21:06,841 --> 00:21:08,240
- Gosh. - I...

370
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,111
I knew I would cry.

371
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:13,611
- I cry very easily. - Se Jeong is crying. Oh, no.

372
00:21:24,121 --> 00:21:25,990
Winners, please wait for...

373
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:28,391
the Unicorn Ticketing that will happen soon.

374
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:31,561
All members of the losing team must earn tickets from the fans...

375
00:21:31,561 --> 00:21:34,331
to be able to advance to the Universe.

376
00:21:35,801 --> 00:21:37,071
It's okay. Everything will work out.

377
00:21:37,071 --> 00:21:38,301
Good work.

378
00:21:38,371 --> 00:21:40,601
- Thank you. - Thank you.

379
00:21:42,071 --> 00:21:43,710
I can't wait for the next team.

380
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,841
- Team Charismatic. - I'm looking forward to that team.

381
00:21:45,841 --> 00:21:47,980
I can't wait to watch them perform. I like that they're going last too.

382
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,250
It suits that they're going last.

383
00:21:50,411 --> 00:21:52,351
- I'm nervous. - You're nervous?

384
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:54,780
(The last round of the Revenge Battle, Charismatic)

385
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,480
Here are the two teams...

386
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,151
that will put on the last round of the Revenge Battle.

387
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:01,690
(Anticipating)

388
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:02,920
I haven't finished yet.

389
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,260
(They cheer intensely even before the introduction.)

390
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,861
I really wanted to watch them perform.

391
00:22:06,561 --> 00:22:08,861
(Why are the girls looking forward to their performances?)

392
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,631
(It was the day the concepts were disclosed.)

393
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,401
(The Winners came together to pick the concept and the song.)

394
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:16,770
(I like that concept, Charismatic.)

395
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:17,811
Should I get out there?

396
00:22:18,341 --> 00:22:20,041
- Walk there confidently. - Let's walk confidently.

397
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:22,980
I couldn't afford not taking this concept.

398
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:25,051
That's what I had in mind.

399
00:22:26,881 --> 00:22:27,920
(A lot of girls chose the concept, Charismatic.)

400
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,220
There are so many people.

401
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:32,121
- There are so many people. - Gosh. It's crowded here.

402
00:22:32,121 --> 00:22:34,490
Only eight people can join Team Charismatic.

403
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,460
But 16 of you applied to be on this team.

404
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,730
(There are only 8 spots, but 16 Winners applied for it.)

405
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:40,161
- Gosh. That's a lot of people. - Only half of us can join the team.

406
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,861
Win! Battle it out!

407
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:43,371
(There are only 8 spots for the Charismatic concept.)

408
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,571
- I was confident. - Run!

409
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,341
I told myself that losing was not an option.

410
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:56,480
(The competition to join the team is quite fierce.)

411
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,780
(The competition to join the team is quite fierce.)

412
00:23:04,051 --> 00:23:07,561
You will be on Team Charismatic.

413
00:23:07,561 --> 00:23:09,161
Congratulations.

414
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,831
Our team has vocalists, dancers,

415
00:23:13,131 --> 00:23:15,131
rappers, and beautiful performers.

416
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,871
We're the complete package.

417
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,730
So I don't have to worry at all.

418
00:23:20,301 --> 00:23:25,270
(A beautiful performer)

419
00:23:25,611 --> 00:23:30,680
(Dancers)

420
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:34,750
(Dancers)

421
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:39,291
(This talented team of the Winners also includes a great vocalist.)

422
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:43,220
I must win this battle no matter what...

423
00:23:43,361 --> 00:23:44,460
because there won't be a next time.

424
00:23:44,661 --> 00:23:45,990
I think we'll win.

425
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:50,270
(Which song did the Charismatic Winners choose?)

426
00:23:50,371 --> 00:23:53,740
("DDU-DU DDU-DU" by BLACKPINK was chosen by the Winners.)

427
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:56,041
(It's a sophisticated hip-hop song with intense beats.)

428
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:00,381
("DDU-DU DDU-DU" by Charismatic Winners)

429
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:06,551
Our team is really well-balanced. We only have talented performers.

430
00:24:06,551 --> 00:24:08,321
I'm really happy with my team.

431
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,621
Nana!

432
00:24:11,551 --> 00:24:14,190
I hope Kim Sujin does well.

433
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,760
(Going up against them are the Charismatic Challengers.)

434
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,030
By the way, they look really intense too.

435
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:20,301
- So intense. - They are...

436
00:24:20,631 --> 00:24:21,960
Gosh, they look intense.

437
00:24:23,101 --> 00:24:26,401
(The Challengers are exuding a fierce aura too.)

438
00:24:26,401 --> 00:24:28,341
- You look so cool. - You guys look great.

439
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:30,371
(The Challengers are exuding a fierce aura too.)

440
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:33,141
Gehlee Dangca looks really intense.

441
00:24:33,141 --> 00:24:34,381
- Yes. Right. - Right?

442
00:24:34,381 --> 00:24:35,740
- Just by standing there... - Exactly.

443
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:39,811
(She gives off an intense presence just by standing on stage.)

444
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,750
- Hyeonju and Haram are good. - I see.

445
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:44,091
- They must've led the team. - Right.

446
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,690
She's still performing in a girl group.

447
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,690
So I was curious about her performance.

448
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:54,760
(She's currently an idol singer of a group called Cignature.)

449
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,371
(She performs under her stage name, Belle.)

450
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:00,240
I thought that I had to stay focused...

451
00:25:00,371 --> 00:25:01,571
and crush this.

452
00:25:03,041 --> 00:25:06,670
(And there's another talented performer.)

453
00:25:07,141 --> 00:25:11,780
(She showed a powerful performance.)

454
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:18,490
(Her intense performance impressed everyone.)

455
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:23,490
(However,)

456
00:25:23,831 --> 00:25:29,061
(Haram lost by 1 vote.)

457
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:34,470
- Hello. - You're here.

458
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:36,101
- Hello. - Gosh.

459
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:37,641
Gosh. You're back.

460
00:25:37,641 --> 00:25:39,641
(Haram looks away as the Winners enter.)

461
00:25:39,641 --> 00:25:40,710
Why don't you come here?

462
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,841
(Glancing)

463
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,151
I saw my older sister.

464
00:25:47,351 --> 00:25:48,520
(Challenger Haram is an older sister of Challenger Yeram.)

465
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,821
(The Baes are on opposing teams for the same concept.)

466
00:25:51,821 --> 00:25:54,490
So I did get a feeling that...

467
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,631
I might go up against my sister. But I didn't expect it...

468
00:25:57,891 --> 00:26:01,631
to happen this fast. That didn't cross my mind.

469
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,670
So I was very flustered.

470
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:05,131
(She's flustered to go up against her sister.)

471
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:09,401
Since I know my sister's weakness and strength,

472
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:13,311
I might be able to use them to my advantage.

473
00:26:13,911 --> 00:26:15,141
(Her sister provokes her without a heads-up.)

474
00:26:15,141 --> 00:26:16,710
She killed it.

475
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,450
(Don't look at her.)

476
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,020
(Feeling bitter)

477
00:26:21,051 --> 00:26:24,750
I did think that this might be fun.

478
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:28,091
I had never done anything like this with my sister.

479
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:32,690
I did think we'd be able to make this more interesting.

480
00:26:33,561 --> 00:26:37,331
The song you will perform is...

481
00:26:37,331 --> 00:26:38,331
(What's the battle song for Charismatic Challengers?)

482
00:26:38,331 --> 00:26:39,831
This is the most important part.

483
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:42,571
It's "FIRE" by 2NE1.

484
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:45,041
(It's "FIRE" by 2NE1.)

485
00:26:45,411 --> 00:26:50,111
(The group's intense charisma stands out in this song with fast beats.)

486
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:54,020
- That's my favorite song. - We talked about that song.

487
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,020
- Really? - Yes.

488
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,190
This is nice. 2NE1 is my favorite.

489
00:26:57,291 --> 00:26:59,690
I was happy. I was glad we got that song.

490
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:05,490
- It's black versus white. - Gosh.

491
00:27:06,361 --> 00:27:08,460
- You guys look amazing. - You rock.

492
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:11,071
Winners, do you have a strategy for your defense?

493
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:13,401
Their song has this part that goes like...

494
00:27:13,401 --> 00:27:15,601
"I want to go crazy."

495
00:27:16,071 --> 00:27:18,041
(What about that?)

496
00:27:18,041 --> 00:27:20,280
We've already gone crazy for this.

497
00:27:22,311 --> 00:27:25,581
So we're confident to say that they won't be able to beat us.

498
00:27:28,881 --> 00:27:32,450
Okay. Here's the strategy for our offense then.

499
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:36,091
This is called the Revenge Match. It means there must be a revenge.

500
00:27:36,391 --> 00:27:39,490
And I think we'll be better at taking revenge.

501
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,730
I'm sure we can take revenge on them.

502
00:27:46,301 --> 00:27:47,341
That was intense.

503
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,311
(Both teams deliver charismatic messages.)

504
00:27:50,311 --> 00:27:51,341
All right.

505
00:27:52,141 --> 00:27:56,010
Hyeonju. To make your teammates more competitive to win this battle,

506
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,851
you decided to play the villain.

507
00:27:58,351 --> 00:28:00,581
Was I the villain?

508
00:28:00,581 --> 00:28:04,621
(Was I the villain?)

509
00:28:04,621 --> 00:28:05,621
(3 days before the Revenge Battle)

510
00:28:05,621 --> 00:28:08,561
This is the first day of our practice.

511
00:28:08,891 --> 00:28:10,631
Before we start learning the song,

512
00:28:10,891 --> 00:28:13,460
- we must elect a team leader. - Yes.

513
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,960
I thought we already had a leader.

514
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:18,871
I think I sort of took up the position of the leader.

515
00:28:18,871 --> 00:28:20,970
May I have the honor of being the leader?

516
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:22,341
- Yes. - I'd love that.

517
00:28:22,341 --> 00:28:23,670
- That sounds great. - Can you trust me, though?

518
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:25,141
- Yes. - Why?

519
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:26,541
We trust you.

520
00:28:26,541 --> 00:28:27,811
Hyeonju is the leader.

521
00:28:27,811 --> 00:28:28,841
It's settled.

522
00:28:28,841 --> 00:28:30,141
- I hope we work well together. - Yes.

523
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:32,680
- I'll do my best... - Great.

524
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,851
for our team.

525
00:28:34,051 --> 00:28:36,351
I'm acting as a leader for the first time in my life.

526
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:40,051
It's true that I wasn't as passionate as the other girls.

527
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:45,291
(During the 1-on-1 Battle)

528
00:28:50,131 --> 00:28:51,730
Hyeonju,

529
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,141
you weren't as passionate as the first-years.

530
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,440
That's why...

531
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,411
I was disappointed in your performance today.

532
00:28:58,811 --> 00:29:03,381
If you want to compete against these girls,

533
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:07,851
you must adjust your attitude for a competition TV show.

534
00:29:08,321 --> 00:29:09,920
"I can do only up to this part."

535
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,591
Don't set your limit.

536
00:29:11,591 --> 00:29:14,291
I hope you can show us you can transcend your limit.

537
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:16,821
The winner of this battle is...

538
00:29:17,861 --> 00:29:19,331
(Hyeonju lost to Yeram with a score of 2 to 3.)

539
00:29:19,331 --> 00:29:20,730
Bae Yeram.

540
00:29:21,831 --> 00:29:23,000
Thank you.

541
00:29:23,401 --> 00:29:27,101
This performance helped me become more passionate about this.

542
00:29:27,101 --> 00:29:29,301
It definitely motivated me to do more.

543
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:33,680
They must be feeling arrogant now. I'll put them in their place.

544
00:29:34,641 --> 00:29:35,641
Seven, eight.

545
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:38,480
(The Challengers begin practicing the choreography.)

546
00:29:41,151 --> 00:29:42,151
You're way too far.

547
00:29:42,151 --> 00:29:43,950
Can you adjust your formation based on my spot?

548
00:29:44,321 --> 00:29:45,391
Can you move to the side a bit?

549
00:29:45,391 --> 00:29:47,760
I'll position myself first.

550
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:50,861
It might be because she has experience.

551
00:29:50,861 --> 00:29:52,430
She was good at keeping things organized.

552
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:53,960
You just have to pretend you're taking big strides.

553
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:57,331
I trust our leader...

554
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:00,170
because she's been a really good teacher so far.

555
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:02,641
You must memorize the lyrics by tomorrow morning.

556
00:30:02,641 --> 00:30:05,010
- Okay. - Memorize them as much as you can.

557
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:07,611
If you can practice in your room, practice your own parts.

558
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,141
What about going over the details?

559
00:30:09,411 --> 00:30:10,480
It's hard to adjust after...

560
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,881
To do that, we must memorize the choreography first.

561
00:30:11,881 --> 00:30:13,920
- Right. - Memorize the choreography first.

562
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:17,151
Once we finish learning the choreography, we'll do that.

563
00:30:17,151 --> 00:30:20,361
Anyway, we'll definitely polish the details. So don't worry.

564
00:30:20,621 --> 00:30:22,720
(That night,)

565
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:28,700
(someone is singing at the dorm.)

566
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:33,170
(Gehlee Dangca is diligently working on the assignment from her leader.)

567
00:30:33,871 --> 00:30:38,341
I felt a little disappointed.

568
00:30:38,641 --> 00:30:40,480
(During the 1-on-1 Battle...)

569
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,680
(But I do believe that you would still be capable of...)

570
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:46,851
(looking beautiful even if you stop trying to look pretty on stage.)

571
00:30:46,851 --> 00:30:49,020
(So I would like to see you perform...)

572
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,990
(without being conscious of your looks on stage.)

573
00:30:51,351 --> 00:30:52,891
(Okay.)

574
00:30:53,091 --> 00:30:55,391
(I had a realization because...)

575
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,760
("Oh, true.")

576
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:03,331
(2 days before the Revenge Battle)

577
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:07,500
(Gehlee Dangca is practicing while burying her head in the wall.)

578
00:31:07,871 --> 00:31:09,571
(Feeling proud)

579
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:18,051
(She keeps on practicing her singing.)

580
00:31:18,411 --> 00:31:21,881
So I'm going to take it as a lesson for myself to improve.

581
00:31:22,321 --> 00:31:24,220
But it won't happen again.

582
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:32,260
(Everyone sings the song together to practice.)

583
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:38,631
For this part... "So my silky hair flutters away."

584
00:31:38,631 --> 00:31:40,000
We should all sing it like Gehlee.

585
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,141
She can sing this part really well.

586
00:31:42,301 --> 00:31:44,170
She said you were good at this part.

587
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:45,871
So everyone has to sing like you.

588
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:47,881
- Thank you. - The notes are pretty high.

589
00:31:47,881 --> 00:31:50,141
Suan, your pitch is dropping a lot.

590
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,680
- The notes are really high. - It's the my-silky-hair part.

591
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,151
Your pitch is dropping very subtly.

592
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,621
You can raise your pitch just a bit higher.

593
00:31:56,151 --> 00:31:59,551
(Chaea is struggling to sing the song in tune.)

594
00:31:59,551 --> 00:32:00,920
Did she sing in tune?

595
00:32:01,091 --> 00:32:02,760
- No. - I don't know the notes.

596
00:32:03,061 --> 00:32:04,530
You must learn the notes quickly.

597
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,530
I want to show people that they can do well.

598
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:09,430
Who's that in the back? Chaea.

599
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,530
Chaea.

600
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,101
Come here.

601
00:32:12,631 --> 00:32:14,440
You must come out a bit more in this formation.

602
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:15,871
Move a bit more here.

603
00:32:15,871 --> 00:32:16,940
(Focused)

604
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,470
Minseo, you're moving a bit fast here.

605
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,470
Okay.

606
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:20,710
You said you were done earlier.

607
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,581
You lied.

608
00:32:23,411 --> 00:32:26,811
Our team has to win, so we must do well as a team.

609
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:29,750
I'm trying my best to bring out their talents...

610
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:32,720
and include them in our performance as much as possible.

611
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:37,161
(1 day before the Revenge Battle)

612
00:32:37,591 --> 00:32:41,760
(An interim check with Yeji and Chaeryeong of ITZY)

613
00:32:54,811 --> 00:32:56,440
- Gosh. - Thank you.

614
00:32:56,841 --> 00:32:58,851
Goodness, seriously.

615
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:02,051
I can tell that you guys worked really hard on this.

616
00:33:04,121 --> 00:33:07,361
But both teams are really good.

617
00:33:07,361 --> 00:33:09,121
So you guys shouldn't let your guard down.

618
00:33:09,561 --> 00:33:11,291
No one knows which team will win.

619
00:33:11,291 --> 00:33:14,331
I think you should have a secret weapon...

620
00:33:14,331 --> 00:33:16,460
that can guarantee your victory.

621
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,371
The same advice goes for you and your opposing team.

622
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,401
(They need an ironclad strategy to get their revenge.)

623
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,611
I realized a lot from their feedback.

624
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:27,980
I can't explain it, but I had this picture in my head...

625
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,480
about this song, "FIRE."

626
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:32,411
"She's good at this, so she should do this."

627
00:33:32,411 --> 00:33:33,950
I had a plan.

628
00:33:34,081 --> 00:33:35,720
Look cool as you keep your heads down.

629
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:37,250
Four, stand up.

630
00:33:39,121 --> 00:33:40,760
Then you have to get up like this.

631
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,760
Yes.

632
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,661
You should walk forward at this tempo in the beginning.

633
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:46,960
One, two.

634
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,901
Yes. Good.

635
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:52,530
This part suits you.

636
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:54,470
- I think Gehlee will do a good job. - I think so too.

637
00:33:57,411 --> 00:34:02,811
(Gehlee is getting more confident thanks to their compliments.)

638
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:04,981
I love your facial expression in the beginning.

639
00:34:04,981 --> 00:34:06,711
He said your facial expression was really good.

640
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:08,680
Thank you.

641
00:34:09,481 --> 00:34:11,691
In the beginning,

642
00:34:11,691 --> 00:34:13,891
Gehlee will dominate the stage with her intense aura.

643
00:34:14,161 --> 00:34:15,391
Haram will show off her powerful dance.

644
00:34:15,391 --> 00:34:17,331
(Hyeonju's ironclad strategy 2: Haram's powerful dance part)

645
00:34:17,331 --> 00:34:18,490
Get down a bit more.

646
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:20,630
Get down and dance more aggressively.

647
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,501
Yes. Exactly. Do that.

648
00:34:23,831 --> 00:34:27,271
(Observing)

649
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,200
You don't walk after the body roll.

650
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:31,141
You walk while finishing off the body roll.

651
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:32,711
This will look more natural.

652
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:36,211
My solo dance part takes up half of our performance.

653
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:40,351
I really need to pull it off nicely. I slightly feel the pressure for it.

654
00:34:40,581 --> 00:34:42,121
I'll do my best.

655
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,751
(With Hyeonju's leadership, their strategy is getting stronger.)

656
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:46,751
Yes.

657
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:53,530
Our strategy is that all eight of us have different charms.

658
00:34:55,331 --> 00:34:58,930
I dare say this will be a legendary performance.

659
00:35:01,001 --> 00:35:02,700
Look me in the eye. We can do this.

660
00:35:03,041 --> 00:35:05,171
Be confident. In 1, 2, 3.

661
00:35:05,171 --> 00:35:06,240
- Let's go! - Let's go!

662
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,411
(Good luck, Charismatic Challengers.)

663
00:35:07,811 --> 00:35:09,240
Good luck!

664
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,581
I bet their performance will be really cool.

665
00:35:10,581 --> 00:35:11,811
- Totally. - Yes.

666
00:35:12,351 --> 00:35:14,180
Gosh. A battle between two sisters.

667
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,751
Right?

668
00:35:18,191 --> 00:35:20,220
I was taught not to get involved in a family squabble.

669
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:28,161
Gehlee Dangca is in the middle.

670
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:30,200
- Gosh, I can't wait. - Gosh.

671
00:35:30,771 --> 00:35:31,831
What's going on?

672
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:38,110
("FIRE" by 2NE1)

673
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:51,391
(Pleasantly surprised)

674
00:35:51,391 --> 00:35:52,891
Why do they look so gorgeous?

675
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:19,911
I got goosebumps!

676
00:36:33,331 --> 00:36:34,700
She's so cool!

677
00:36:49,911 --> 00:36:50,911
Nice.

678
00:37:19,871 --> 00:37:20,911
Oh, my gosh!

679
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,820
Let's go!

680
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:38,030
Let's go!

681
00:37:41,231 --> 00:37:42,961
Gosh, she's amazing.

682
00:38:31,711 --> 00:38:32,751
Goodness.

683
00:38:36,021 --> 00:38:37,320
I got goosebumps.

684
00:38:37,921 --> 00:38:40,621
The goosebumps reached the top of my head.

685
00:38:40,621 --> 00:38:42,121
They were seriously cool.

686
00:38:42,121 --> 00:38:43,521
That was awesome.

687
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:45,331
- That was crazy good. - Gosh.

688
00:38:47,831 --> 00:38:50,260
Fantastic. Everyone was great.

689
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,101
- Great job. - Thank you.

690
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:00,470
Gehlee Dangca doesn't have to do anything but just stand.

691
00:39:00,541 --> 00:39:02,840
She's the center beauty, period.

692
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,911
- Yes. - Right?

693
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:06,180
Gehlee Dangca's first expression was the bomb.

694
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:08,081
The way she walked out was charismatic.

695
00:39:08,081 --> 00:39:09,180
I know, right?

696
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,921
- I loved her expression. - Yes.

697
00:39:11,691 --> 00:39:15,490
Haram's dance break was cool.

698
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:16,490
I'm serious.

699
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:18,161
Haram is really charming.

700
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:20,260
They killed it.

701
00:39:21,161 --> 00:39:24,800
Let's see. This stage made me want to praise...

702
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,171
not the one who was good...

703
00:39:27,171 --> 00:39:30,101
but the one who was outstanding and did better than before.

704
00:39:30,271 --> 00:39:32,340
And that very contestant...

705
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,641
- was Bae Haram. - Yes.

706
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,950
"I will show them everything I've got in this performance."

707
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:41,320
With that mindset,

708
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:45,851
your expression and dance...

709
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:48,220
were in perfect balance.

710
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:51,731
You were fabulous, like this was your own stage.

711
00:39:51,731 --> 00:39:53,930
I wanted tell you how cool you were.

712
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:55,130
Thank you.

713
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:59,231
- Haram. - Yes?

714
00:39:59,501 --> 00:40:01,070
I hope you don't compete...

715
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:03,541
against your younger sister and debut together.

716
00:40:03,541 --> 00:40:05,010
Same here.

717
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:07,570
Me too. I don't want to compete against her.

718
00:40:08,041 --> 00:40:10,110
You were exceptional.

719
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:14,251
It's not an overstatement that you stood out the most in this stage.

720
00:40:14,251 --> 00:40:17,121
You really killed this concept, Haram.

721
00:40:17,751 --> 00:40:20,650
And here's a personal suggestion.

722
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,891
Gehlee Dangca.

723
00:40:23,391 --> 00:40:25,331
You give off...

724
00:40:25,331 --> 00:40:28,760
this special vibe just by standing on stage.

725
00:40:29,331 --> 00:40:30,601
Thank you.

726
00:40:30,601 --> 00:40:35,070
But you've never been taught how to dance or sing, have you?

727
00:40:35,671 --> 00:40:37,001
Dance-wise, no.

728
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:38,740
- I see. - Is that so?

729
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:40,510
But you have great potential in dancing.

730
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:42,240
It showed in this performance.

731
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,550
I was able to tell you improved a bit.

732
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:47,610
I believe you're a contestant who can shine much more on stage...

733
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:49,650
if you improve more in dancing.

734
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:53,191
Please keep practicing a lot and pour in all your effort...

735
00:40:53,191 --> 00:40:56,490
to stand out more on stage.

736
00:40:56,961 --> 00:40:58,260
Thank you.

737
00:41:00,331 --> 00:41:04,800
I want to tell Hyeonju what a great job she did.

738
00:41:05,871 --> 00:41:08,570
I felt bad that you cried last time.

739
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:11,010
But I didn't make you cry. You cried by yourself.

740
00:41:12,171 --> 00:41:14,411
- Where's your empathy? - That was unempathetic.

741
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:18,880
Anyway, I felt that you put in a lot of time and energy...

742
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,820
to take care of all the members.

743
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:25,220
- Thank you. - But I still believe that...

744
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:27,621
- you can do much better. - Me too.

745
00:41:27,691 --> 00:41:31,831
I wish there comes a moment when you let down the pressure...

746
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:35,700
to have to do something and show your real self.

747
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:38,771
I'll be waiting for that stage.

748
00:41:39,331 --> 00:41:40,731
Good work.

749
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:45,271
- Thank you. - Thank you.

750
00:41:47,141 --> 00:41:49,211
- Gosh, I'm excited about it. - Same.

751
00:41:49,541 --> 00:41:51,950
Let's watch Charismatic Winners' stage.

752
00:41:57,351 --> 00:41:59,121
You can do it, Nana!

753
00:41:59,621 --> 00:42:01,121
I can't wait to see it!

754
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:02,760
Oh, my.

755
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,260
- They must feel the pressure. - Right?

756
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:09,601
I would feel too much pressure to perform if I were on this team.

757
00:42:09,601 --> 00:42:11,630
I bet they'll be as good as Challengers.

758
00:42:12,331 --> 00:42:14,030
They're the Avengers.

759
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:15,271
Totally.

760
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:19,771
I heard there were three leaders in Team Winners.

761
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:21,481
Really?

762
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,840
What?

763
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:26,711
(There are 3 leaders?)

764
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,320
- Okay. - First off.

765
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,751
We need to select the leader.

766
00:42:29,751 --> 00:42:31,891
Who wants to be the leader? Raise your hand.

767
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,320
- No one? - I don't mind being the leader.

768
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:36,590
(Does she want to do it?)

769
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:38,961
- As a leader... - I want to try it.

770
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:41,300
How about we recommend a leader?

771
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:42,331
"Recommend?"

772
00:42:42,331 --> 00:42:44,360
- Recommend. - Who has someone to recommend?

773
00:42:45,101 --> 00:42:46,570
I recommend you two.

774
00:42:47,601 --> 00:42:49,641
- Yes. - You two are good candidates.

775
00:42:50,271 --> 00:42:51,970
- Then... - Do you want to do it?

776
00:42:52,671 --> 00:42:54,340
- I don't mind. - Same here.

777
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:57,110
- Then, let's vote on a leader. - All right.

778
00:42:57,211 --> 00:42:58,581
I was thinking about doing it.

779
00:42:59,081 --> 00:43:04,220
I usually do lead a lot.

780
00:43:04,521 --> 00:43:07,391
If I became the leader,

781
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:09,691
I didn't think I'd do a bad job at it.

782
00:43:09,691 --> 00:43:12,891
I kind of knew that...

783
00:43:12,891 --> 00:43:15,461
I was a smart girl.

784
00:43:15,561 --> 00:43:18,231
Who votes on Sujin?

785
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:20,900
Got it. Next.

786
00:43:21,671 --> 00:43:23,501
Why is this making me nervous?

787
00:43:23,771 --> 00:43:25,441
Okay. We're done.

788
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:26,941
Who is it?

789
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:28,711
Here's the result.

790
00:43:28,711 --> 00:43:29,911
- Is it me? - Congratulations.

791
00:43:30,081 --> 00:43:32,851
Thank you. I'll do my best.

792
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,880
(Feeling bummed out)

793
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,090
As I'm 15 years old,

794
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:41,291
I'm one of the younger members. So, becoming the leader...

795
00:43:41,691 --> 00:43:44,661
has made me quite worried.

796
00:43:44,661 --> 00:43:47,760
But I'll give it my all to guide...

797
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,900
and give feedback to everyone.

798
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:53,570
I'll turn the music on, so give it a go.

799
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:54,570
Start.

800
00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:58,570
(The practice started under Sujin's leadership.)

801
00:44:02,081 --> 00:44:03,840
(Having memorized the choreography,)

802
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,610
(Sumin and Yeram are practicing the details.)

803
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:07,650
Pull on "Hit" and "With."

804
00:44:08,921 --> 00:44:10,280
- This part. - Yes?

805
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,291
- What? - Hold on.

806
00:44:11,291 --> 00:44:12,291
Nizi?

807
00:44:12,291 --> 00:44:14,990
- Stretch your arms out like Nizi. - How?

808
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:16,990
Stretch the arm out straight,

809
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:18,360
- then nod. - Okay.

810
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:21,430
(Sujin gives feedback on the spot throughout the practice.)

811
00:44:21,501 --> 00:44:23,161
Yes. That was good, Nizi.

812
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:24,400
- Really? - Like this.

813
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,630
Stretch out, then nod.

814
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:28,400
(The 15-year-old leader leads the team charismatically.)

815
00:44:29,641 --> 00:44:33,340
(With Sujin as the leader, Winners focus on practicing.)

816
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:36,340
Yes, we're back!

817
00:44:38,351 --> 00:44:40,911
I'm back.

818
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:45,921
(It's break time after practicing hard.)

819
00:44:47,921 --> 00:44:51,561
(Just as they chat for a bit,)

820
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:58,671
(Sujin summons them to practice again.)

821
00:45:00,501 --> 00:45:02,070
- We're going to practice. - Hit you with that

822
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:04,941
(Not in harmony)

823
00:45:06,541 --> 00:45:08,981
(They are such bright girls.)

824
00:45:09,211 --> 00:45:11,110
Memorize the choreography.

825
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:13,880
Your eyes were wandering.

826
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,581
Fix that, please.

827
00:45:15,581 --> 00:45:19,220
Keep the arms up high.

828
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:22,291
Pay attention to your expressions more.

829
00:45:22,291 --> 00:45:25,331
Practice the details more.

830
00:45:26,831 --> 00:45:28,260
(Leader Sujin's evaluation time continues.)

831
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:30,530
It should be this, but you do it like this.

832
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:32,130
"Is this right?"

833
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:34,900
Honestly, it didn't feel like a team.

834
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:36,840
Five, six, seven, eight.

835
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:37,941
(They practice the formation.)

836
00:45:37,941 --> 00:45:41,541
Should we check our formation when we move outwards?

837
00:45:41,541 --> 00:45:42,941
- Sorry? - Like how far we go.

838
00:45:42,941 --> 00:45:44,110
We're not a triangle.

839
00:45:44,851 --> 00:45:46,510
- Move out a bit more. - Okay.

840
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:48,050
Balance out from the center.

841
00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:49,751
The camera is the center.

842
00:45:49,751 --> 00:45:51,081
Move in a bit more.

843
00:45:52,421 --> 00:45:54,921
The front and back gaps when we stand in a line.

844
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:56,791
Yes?

845
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:00,630
Those in the back are closer to each other.

846
00:46:01,731 --> 00:46:03,130
Can you stand in line, Sujin?

847
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:04,700
We should move back a bit more.

848
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:09,001
If we move outwards from when we're standing in one line,

849
00:46:09,001 --> 00:46:11,240
no one will bump into each other.

850
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:12,711
I was originally the leader.

851
00:46:12,711 --> 00:46:16,911
But it felt like the team would do well even without a leader.

852
00:46:16,911 --> 00:46:18,851
It was as if everyone was the leader.

853
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:21,010
I couldn't help but feel like that.

854
00:46:21,081 --> 00:46:22,220
- We should move out more. - Wait.

855
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:24,450
How far can those in the front move?

856
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:27,050
When you dance, the choreography shouldn't look bad.

857
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:30,021
Did you understand? As much as you can.

858
00:46:30,021 --> 00:46:32,090
But the choreography shouldn't look bad.

859
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:34,231
Keep the choreography,

860
00:46:34,231 --> 00:46:37,161
but move while keeping the balance with Nizi in the center.

861
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,501
- Good. - Not the back.

862
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:42,271
(Sujin is trying to move on.)

863
00:46:42,271 --> 00:46:44,371
(While Sumin pays attention to the details.)

864
00:46:44,371 --> 00:46:45,911
- It's about the space. - The space.

865
00:46:45,941 --> 00:46:47,070
The space between you guys.

866
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:49,641
(Their subtle war of nerves confuses the others.)

867
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:50,811
Ready, go.

868
00:46:50,811 --> 00:46:52,780
(The practice continues while they compete for leadership.)

869
00:46:53,251 --> 00:46:54,680
Are you crying? No, right?

870
00:46:55,581 --> 00:46:57,121
- Why are you crying? - It's nothing.

871
00:46:57,121 --> 00:46:58,291
I'm okay.

872
00:46:58,590 --> 00:46:59,990
- Hey, why are you crying? - What's wrong?

873
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:02,720
(Alyssa suddenly bursts into tears.)

874
00:47:03,661 --> 00:47:04,791
Why are you crying?

875
00:47:04,891 --> 00:47:05,930
- No. - Oh, boy.

876
00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:08,630
(Nana also bursts into tears.)

877
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:10,760
What's wrong?

878
00:47:11,671 --> 00:47:13,470
Nana, what's wrong?

879
00:47:14,101 --> 00:47:15,941
- Don't cry, guys. - What's wrong?

880
00:47:15,941 --> 00:47:17,400
- Are you all right? - It's okay.

881
00:47:18,141 --> 00:47:19,711
Did something make you sad?

882
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:25,411
We had a short amount of time to practice,

883
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:29,720
and Sujin and Sumin had a disagreement.

884
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:32,590
I was a little confused.

885
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:38,090
I feel a bit frustrated about that.

886
00:47:38,831 --> 00:47:42,630
I want to change the dance break and make it cooler.

887
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:47,171
For Sumin, Yeram, Nana, and me.

888
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:52,441
(Dance break part 1 for Sujin and Yeram)

889
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:57,581
(Dance break part 2 for Sumin and Nana)

890
00:47:57,581 --> 00:48:01,211
I'd like to change the choreography.

891
00:48:01,251 --> 00:48:02,450
What do you guys think?

892
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:09,260
I think the choreography is cool as it is,

893
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:12,461
and if it's not necessary to change it,

894
00:48:12,461 --> 00:48:14,360
perhaps we shouldn't.

895
00:48:14,661 --> 00:48:17,800
The part for me and Nana is like...

896
00:48:17,831 --> 00:48:19,970
- where we finish it up, - I agree.

897
00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:24,501
and the original choreography is good for it.

898
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:28,541
The two of you can change your part.

899
00:48:28,541 --> 00:48:29,981
It's settled then. Let's practice.

900
00:48:29,981 --> 00:48:32,550
(They've decided to change Sujin and Yeram's part only.)

901
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:36,121
(They start practicing without Sujin and Yeram.)

902
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,650
Boom. No, not like this.

903
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:40,121
Boom and down. We could go with this.

904
00:48:40,891 --> 00:48:42,561
I wanted it to be more impactful...

905
00:48:42,561 --> 00:48:45,331
so that we can represent our team better.

906
00:48:45,331 --> 00:48:48,530
That's why I changed the dance break.

907
00:48:49,061 --> 00:48:54,070
But we hadn't finished working on our choreography overall,

908
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:59,610
and it was causing a delay when we still had much work to do.

909
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:03,840
(It's time for their dance lesson.)

910
00:49:04,811 --> 00:49:05,981
Get down lower!

911
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:09,680
Keep looking at the front.

912
00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:12,050
You're too far away.

913
00:49:14,121 --> 00:49:16,260
Alyssa, you should've come farther forward.

914
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:21,731
Guys, you're not dancing in sync right now.

915
00:49:21,731 --> 00:49:23,260
You're dancing as a group,

916
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:27,200
so try to remember all the details you've worked on together.

917
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,200
- Okay. - Okay.

918
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,371
Alyssa.

919
00:49:29,371 --> 00:49:32,371
You're falling a little behind, to be honest.

920
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:34,271
You should work harder.

921
00:49:35,941 --> 00:49:37,280
Let's work on the dance break.

922
00:49:37,411 --> 00:49:39,550
- We'll work on our dance break. - Okay.

923
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:42,280
(We'll work on our dance break.)

924
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:48,150
(Even after the criticism, all they can think about is the dance break.)

925
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:50,391
I couldn't understand them.

926
00:49:50,561 --> 00:49:53,791
It's like they want their dance break to stand out...

927
00:49:53,791 --> 00:49:56,760
while we still haven't worked out the overall choreography.

928
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:00,970
At this rate,

929
00:50:01,641 --> 00:50:04,200
we may not be able to beat the Challengers.

930
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:07,311
I'm deeply concerned about that.

931
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:08,641
All right.

932
00:50:08,641 --> 00:50:09,680
(1 day before the Revenge Battle)

933
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,240
Let's try again, shall we?

934
00:50:11,481 --> 00:50:13,380
Before we do, we should talk.

935
00:50:13,481 --> 00:50:14,550
Sure.

936
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:16,320
Let's sit down, guys.

937
00:50:17,421 --> 00:50:18,921
- You have something to say? - Yes.

938
00:50:19,751 --> 00:50:20,851
All right.

939
00:50:21,590 --> 00:50:22,961
Listen.

940
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:25,661
- Tomorrow is the battle, right? - Yes.

941
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:28,260
So for now, we should focus on mastering the overall choreography,

942
00:50:28,331 --> 00:50:31,260
and when we're done with that,

943
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,831
we can work on the dance break.

944
00:50:33,831 --> 00:50:37,941
And if we don't have much time left for that,

945
00:50:38,041 --> 00:50:40,970
we should just stick with the original dance break.

946
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:44,680
I think we'll have better results that way.

947
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:49,421
So as for today's practice, that's what we should do.

948
00:50:49,481 --> 00:50:51,021
Well,

949
00:50:51,021 --> 00:50:52,691
in my opinion,

950
00:50:53,121 --> 00:50:56,720
we could just practice...

951
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:01,260
both the original dance break and our new one.

952
00:51:01,461 --> 00:51:02,961
Right, I get what you're saying.

953
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,501
But have you guys finished your new dance break?

954
00:51:06,030 --> 00:51:08,871
Well, we just need to trim it a little.

955
00:51:09,101 --> 00:51:10,641
But that's...

956
00:51:10,641 --> 00:51:13,010
It's not going to take much time.

957
00:51:13,771 --> 00:51:15,811
I wasn't happy with it...

958
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:18,880
because they insisted on working on the dance break.

959
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:24,021
(The practice begins while everyone is feeling a little dispirited.)

960
00:51:24,021 --> 00:51:25,220
- Girls. - Hello.

961
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:27,291
- Hello. - Hello.

962
00:51:27,291 --> 00:51:28,561
Come on, let's do it.

963
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:31,121
(Sujin and Yeram suddenly start doing their dance break.)

964
00:51:31,121 --> 00:51:32,561
- Like this? - Yes.

965
00:51:35,731 --> 00:51:37,700
What was that just now?

966
00:51:37,961 --> 00:51:40,101
- Our new dance break. - You made a new one?

967
00:51:40,101 --> 00:51:42,840
Can I get a quick look?

968
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:43,840
Okay.

969
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,010
Oh, my gosh.

970
00:51:45,171 --> 00:51:47,240
- Wait. Let us run through it once. - Just once.

971
00:51:47,711 --> 00:51:51,110
(Sumin isn't happy about this situation.)

972
00:51:52,351 --> 00:51:58,490
(They show her their new dance break.)

973
00:52:02,891 --> 00:52:05,030
That's great. It is.

974
00:52:05,961 --> 00:52:08,400
But if you ask me, the show is tomorrow.

975
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,601
Although your new piece looks great,

976
00:52:10,601 --> 00:52:13,630
you don't have much time, so why not stick to the original?

977
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:14,771
That's cool.

978
00:52:15,470 --> 00:52:16,570
That's cool.

979
00:52:17,871 --> 00:52:19,911
When I suggested the same thing,

980
00:52:19,911 --> 00:52:22,581
they seemed like they didn't want to do it.

981
00:52:22,711 --> 00:52:24,610
But suddenly, they agreed to it.

982
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:29,780
It was like they only wanted to listen to the teacher and not me.

983
00:52:29,851 --> 00:52:32,691
That's how it seemed to me.

984
00:52:34,751 --> 00:52:37,961
First of all, let's work out the dance break and the details...

985
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:39,731
and fill the others in later.

986
00:52:39,831 --> 00:52:41,661
I'm marking the details right now,

987
00:52:41,661 --> 00:52:43,200
so I'll take care of that.

988
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:46,800
We shouldn't practice separately today.

989
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:50,501
We've wasted a lot of time doing that so far.

990
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:51,541
- Let's just... - Maybe...

991
00:52:51,541 --> 00:52:54,041
it's better that I mark the details and let you guys know.

992
00:52:54,211 --> 00:52:55,311
Why?

993
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:59,010
Because Yeram also knows pretty much all the details already.

994
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:00,911
I do too. I'm just checking them again.

995
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:04,550
(Flustered by Sumin's firm attitude)

996
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:05,851
Actually,

997
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:09,720
I want to talk to you about something.

998
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:11,731
- Sujin, can I talk to you? - Okay.

999
00:53:11,731 --> 00:53:12,990
Check the details.

1000
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:21,700
Sujin, I get that you are enthusiastic and want to do well,

1001
00:53:21,970 --> 00:53:25,371
but you might come off as selfish this way.

1002
00:53:25,771 --> 00:53:28,680
You should know what we should focus on...

1003
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:30,510
and try to complete the performance,

1004
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:33,081
but to me, it didn't seem like that's what you were doing at all.

1005
00:53:33,650 --> 00:53:36,320
It wasn't my intention to be selfish,

1006
00:53:37,081 --> 00:53:39,650
and I wasn't trying to take control of everything.

1007
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:42,090
But if you felt that way,

1008
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:44,391
I should certainly work on that.

1009
00:53:45,161 --> 00:53:47,731
Well, this is your first time leading a team,

1010
00:53:48,191 --> 00:53:50,860
and I feel like I should...

1011
00:53:50,930 --> 00:53:53,030
try and keep the team's balance here.

1012
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:57,171
If we keep going this way, nothing is going to change.

1013
00:53:57,371 --> 00:53:59,211
Here's an idea.

1014
00:53:59,211 --> 00:54:02,740
Maybe we should all be leaders in different parts.

1015
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:05,950
You can take charge of our formation and transition,

1016
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:07,811
Yeram can take charge of the details,

1017
00:54:07,811 --> 00:54:10,751
and I can take charge of our singing.

1018
00:54:10,751 --> 00:54:13,421
The three of us can be leaders.

1019
00:54:13,421 --> 00:54:14,990
Yes, that's fine.

1020
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:17,360
But if there's something we're missing,

1021
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:19,630
we should let each other know straight away.

1022
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:22,501
We should've talked about this sooner.

1023
00:54:22,501 --> 00:54:23,731
You're right.

1024
00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:27,601
It couldn't have been easy for you to bring this up. Thank you so much.

1025
00:54:28,001 --> 00:54:30,400
Let's talk to each other straight away...

1026
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,570
- if anything comes up. - Yes.

1027
00:54:34,541 --> 00:54:37,041
(Sumin and Sujin make up with a hug.)

1028
00:54:37,041 --> 00:54:38,510
- Let's make a good team. - Yes.

1029
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:40,380
- Go, team. - Go, team.

1030
00:54:41,081 --> 00:54:43,650
Sujin is one of the youngest members on the team,

1031
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:47,090
and she became a leader for the first time at a young age.

1032
00:54:47,191 --> 00:54:51,421
It's a tough job, so she probably had a hard time.

1033
00:54:51,461 --> 00:54:54,860
To help her lead our team at a faster pace,

1034
00:54:55,061 --> 00:54:59,130
we decided that Yeram and I could co-lead the team...

1035
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:02,941
and complete our performance together.

1036
00:55:03,101 --> 00:55:05,371
Let's try it from the beginning.

1037
00:55:05,911 --> 00:55:07,771
You should go farther to the side.

1038
00:55:07,771 --> 00:55:08,941
(Sumin is in charge of the formation.)

1039
00:55:08,941 --> 00:55:10,010
You should be over here,

1040
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:11,541
and Nizi, more to the side.

1041
00:55:11,541 --> 00:55:13,780
We should align the angle here.

1042
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:16,921
It's 45 degrees, shoulder, then 45 degrees.

1043
00:55:17,550 --> 00:55:19,450
Let's all shout "hey" loudly together.

1044
00:55:19,450 --> 00:55:20,450
- Okay. - Okay.

1045
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:24,561
(Sujin is in charge of the singing.)

1046
00:55:25,231 --> 00:55:29,961
(Things are now going smoothly for the Winners.)

1047
00:55:29,961 --> 00:55:33,731
Tomorrow, we'll give a killer performance of "DDU-DU DDU-DU."

1048
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:36,400
I'm speaking objectively as the team's leader.

1049
00:55:36,470 --> 00:55:38,941
We're going to kill it tomorrow.

1050
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:41,840
- One, two, three. - One, two, three.

1051
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:44,081
(After all the ups and downs, how will the Winners do?)

1052
00:55:44,081 --> 00:55:46,510
- They've got good energy. - That's great.

1053
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:47,880
Good luck!

1054
00:55:48,311 --> 00:55:49,581
Good luck!

1055
00:55:50,081 --> 00:55:51,320
I think they're going to be great.

1056
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:53,150
- I'm excited. - So am I.

1057
00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:56,521
We've worked really hard,

1058
00:55:56,521 --> 00:55:59,331
so I think this is going to be a good competition.

1059
00:56:03,661 --> 00:56:07,300
("DDU-DU DDU-DU" by BLACKPINK)

1060
00:57:27,550 --> 00:57:28,550
They're good.

1061
00:57:34,351 --> 00:57:35,360
Great.

1062
00:58:25,271 --> 00:58:26,311
Excellent.

1063
00:58:27,441 --> 00:58:29,911
- That was great. - Gosh.

1064
00:58:29,911 --> 00:58:31,340
- I got goosebumps. - Awesome.

1065
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:32,680
Great job!

1066
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:36,320
- They had so much energy. - Exactly.

1067
00:58:39,650 --> 00:58:44,360
(They got goosebumps all over.)

1068
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:46,061
They were so good.

1069
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:47,391
It was crazy.

1070
00:58:47,691 --> 00:58:49,061
In a word, savage.

1071
00:58:49,331 --> 00:58:51,360
I can see why this is the last battle.

1072
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:52,371
Right.

1073
00:58:52,371 --> 00:58:54,731
- Really. - They were so energetic.

1074
00:58:54,731 --> 00:58:56,871
- They were amazing. - That was awesome.

1075
00:58:56,871 --> 00:58:57,900
Terrific job!

1076
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:04,340
All of you did such a wonderful job.

1077
00:59:05,211 --> 00:59:07,550
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1078
00:59:08,550 --> 00:59:09,621
It was terrific.

1079
00:59:09,950 --> 00:59:13,150
Each and every one of you caught my eye.

1080
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:14,191
It's true.

1081
00:59:14,251 --> 00:59:17,021
It's like I rediscovered all of you.

1082
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:19,191
Those with good reputations lived up to it.

1083
00:59:19,961 --> 00:59:22,130
All of you did such a great job.

1084
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:23,130
Really.

1085
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:25,200
Where should I even begin?

1086
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:26,231
I feel you.

1087
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:30,700
First of all, I loved the look in Nana's eyes at the beginning.

1088
00:59:30,941 --> 00:59:31,970
Thank you.

1089
00:59:31,970 --> 00:59:33,041
- Nana looked beautiful. - Yes.

1090
00:59:33,041 --> 00:59:34,970
I thought if her performance was as fierce...

1091
00:59:34,970 --> 00:59:36,311
as her gaze, it'd be amazing,

1092
00:59:36,311 --> 00:59:38,811
and it was. I was really surprised.

1093
00:59:39,211 --> 00:59:40,411
- Sujin. - Yes.

1094
00:59:41,311 --> 00:59:43,581
How can you sing so well even while lying down like that?

1095
00:59:43,581 --> 00:59:45,921
- Thank you. - She was amazing, right?

1096
00:59:53,691 --> 00:59:55,191
- I was deeply impressed. - Yes.

1097
00:59:55,501 --> 00:59:57,300
Your singing was incredible.

1098
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:58,530
Thank you.

1099
00:59:59,671 --> 01:00:00,930
Now, Nizi.

1100
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:03,900
You looked like you were in your element.

1101
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:06,541
You're such a good fit for the song.

1102
01:00:06,541 --> 01:00:08,041
Thank you.

1103
01:00:09,811 --> 01:00:10,941
She's adorable.

1104
01:00:11,610 --> 01:00:12,911
And Jayla.

1105
01:00:13,050 --> 01:00:14,050
Yes.

1106
01:00:14,050 --> 01:00:16,421
- Amazing facial expressions. - I know, right?

1107
01:00:16,421 --> 01:00:18,521
The "come, come" part was insane.

1108
01:00:26,231 --> 01:00:30,661
Now, I want to talk about this person in particular. Yeram.

1109
01:00:32,061 --> 01:00:33,271
Gosh, I mean...

1110
01:00:33,271 --> 01:00:35,570
I was surprised when I saw how you divided up the song.

1111
01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:40,110
You didn't exactly play a major role, Yeram.

1112
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:44,180
And yet, you still performed the way...

1113
01:00:44,481 --> 01:00:46,411
that made yourself stand out.

1114
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:49,380
Wonderful job, Yeram.

1115
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:50,481
- You were amazing. - Oh, boy.

1116
01:00:50,481 --> 01:00:51,521
Don't cry.

1117
01:00:51,521 --> 01:00:52,720
- I mean it. - Don't cry.

1118
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:53,921
Well done.

1119
01:00:55,391 --> 01:00:59,990
(All the compliments about her sister makes Haram choke up.)

1120
01:01:00,231 --> 01:01:03,800
Each and every one of you did such a great job...

1121
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:06,871
playing your own role in the performance.

1122
01:01:06,871 --> 01:01:09,700
You guys were truly amazing.

1123
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:11,340
Really. I applaud you.

1124
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:13,371
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1125
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:16,641
The choice is tougher than I thought.

1126
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:17,780
I know.

1127
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:19,650
- Which team will win? - Which team will win?

1128
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:21,950
- Exactly. Which team will win? - Which team will win?

1129
01:01:21,950 --> 01:01:23,581
But I think the Challengers will win.

1130
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:25,481
I can't choose.

1131
01:01:25,751 --> 01:01:27,521
How do you decide the winner?

1132
01:01:27,521 --> 01:01:28,791
This is really hard.

1133
01:01:28,791 --> 01:01:29,961
(This is a close match where you can't predict the result.)

1134
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:33,461
- They're different. - You're right.

1135
01:01:33,461 --> 01:01:35,831
You want to support both of them for different reasons, right?

1136
01:01:35,831 --> 01:01:36,860
What do I do?

1137
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:39,371
Whoever loses, I'd be sad.

1138
01:01:39,371 --> 01:01:40,970
- I know. - They were both great.

1139
01:01:42,001 --> 01:01:43,240
- Have you decided? - Have you decided?

1140
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:44,840
I can't decide either.

1141
01:01:45,641 --> 01:01:47,171
(This is the toughest decision.)

1142
01:01:47,171 --> 01:01:48,311
I don't know what to do.

1143
01:01:48,311 --> 01:01:49,740
I can't make up my mind.

1144
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:51,541
This is hard.

1145
01:01:56,081 --> 01:01:57,450
My hands are shaking.

1146
01:01:59,521 --> 01:02:01,621
Can't they just make it a draw?

1147
01:02:02,150 --> 01:02:04,161
I'm really torn. What do I do?

1148
01:02:05,461 --> 01:02:08,530
(They've finished voting.)

1149
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:09,831
At last,

1150
01:02:10,530 --> 01:02:11,630
the results...

1151
01:02:12,430 --> 01:02:13,501
are here.

1152
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:20,171
The winner of the charismatic theme is...

1153
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:24,110
(Winners for the charismatic theme)

1154
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:27,711
They did better than I expected,

1155
01:02:28,050 --> 01:02:30,981
but I still thought we were going to win.

1156
01:02:31,981 --> 01:02:34,720
(Challengers for the charismatic theme)

1157
01:02:35,291 --> 01:02:38,360
I think our performance was more powerful,

1158
01:02:38,521 --> 01:02:39,990
so we're probably going to win.

1159
01:02:41,630 --> 01:02:44,030
I'm guessing we'll win with a score of 3 to 2.

1160
01:02:44,731 --> 01:02:45,900
This is nerve-racking.

1161
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:47,731
I wonder what the score is.

1162
01:02:47,731 --> 01:02:48,731
Me too.

1163
01:02:49,171 --> 01:02:51,470
The winner for the charismatic theme is...

1164
01:02:54,209 --> 01:02:56,468
The winner for the charismatic theme is...

1165
01:02:58,879 --> 01:03:00,178
the Winners.

1166
01:03:00,178 --> 01:03:05,948
(The Winners win the battle.)

1167
01:03:10,058 --> 01:03:11,259
Good job, guys.

1168
01:03:11,558 --> 01:03:12,759
Good job.

1169
01:03:13,089 --> 01:03:16,799
Team Winners has won the battle with a score of 4 to 1.

1170
01:03:16,999 --> 01:03:19,299
That's insane. Well, it was a close game.

1171
01:03:23,198 --> 01:03:24,439
The Winners.

1172
01:03:24,569 --> 01:03:28,868
(The Challengers face their second defeat.)

1173
01:03:28,868 --> 01:03:33,808
(The Challengers face their second defeat.)

1174
01:03:33,808 --> 01:03:36,448
Challengers, you did a great job too.

1175
01:03:36,649 --> 01:03:38,749
- You did great! - You were awesome!

1176
01:03:38,749 --> 01:03:40,919
- It was terrific! - Fantastic job!

1177
01:03:41,819 --> 01:03:43,089
You were both amazing!

1178
01:03:45,718 --> 01:03:49,788
Winners, please wait for the Unicorn Ticketing.

1179
01:03:50,359 --> 01:03:53,368
All members of the losing team must earn tickets from the fans...

1180
01:03:53,368 --> 01:03:55,828
to be able to advance to the Universe.

1181
01:03:56,738 --> 01:03:58,299
Great work, everyone.

1182
01:03:58,569 --> 01:04:00,339
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1183
01:04:00,339 --> 01:04:01,709
They did really well.

1184
01:04:01,709 --> 01:04:02,968
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

1185
01:04:03,578 --> 01:04:07,249
You know, I want to see the two sisters perform together.

1186
01:04:07,249 --> 01:04:08,249
So do I.

1187
01:04:08,249 --> 01:04:09,509
- Those two... - I hope they both survive.

1188
01:04:09,509 --> 01:04:11,218
I want both of them to make it.

1189
01:04:11,779 --> 01:04:13,218
- Good work, guys. - Good work.

1190
01:04:13,218 --> 01:04:14,549
You did great.

1191
01:04:14,549 --> 01:04:16,249
Haram, why are you crying?

1192
01:04:17,388 --> 01:04:19,089
Haram, why are you crying?

1193
01:04:21,658 --> 01:04:25,459
I was just sad about the result.

1194
01:04:25,629 --> 01:04:28,569
If Yeram wasn't on the opposing team...

1195
01:04:38,509 --> 01:04:42,209
It's out of my hands. For now, I'll just...

1196
01:04:42,209 --> 01:04:47,549
It really just depends on what people think and...

1197
01:04:48,819 --> 01:04:51,518
(In a moment,)

1198
01:04:53,018 --> 01:04:57,698
(the 41 girls who made it to the Universe will be revealed.)

1199
01:04:57,698 --> 01:05:02,598
(the 41 girls who made it to the Universe will be revealed.)

1200
01:05:03,069 --> 01:05:05,499
The Battle Week began with 82 contestants,

1201
01:05:05,768 --> 01:05:10,638
but only 41 of them can advance to the Universe.

1202
01:05:11,879 --> 01:05:12,939
I'm so nervous.

1203
01:05:16,549 --> 01:05:19,749
We'll now decide the 20 contestants...

1204
01:05:20,089 --> 01:05:24,218
who will advance to the Universe through the Unicorn Ticketing.

1205
01:05:25,618 --> 01:05:27,058
It's only 20. That's too few.

1206
01:05:27,988 --> 01:05:29,959
- So it's four from each team. - Yes.

1207
01:05:32,698 --> 01:05:34,799
Among the winners of the Revenge Battle,

1208
01:05:34,999 --> 01:05:37,669
who will get tickets from the Unicorns?

1209
01:05:38,538 --> 01:05:41,839
It all started to feel real.

1210
01:05:41,908 --> 01:05:44,538
I thought I wanted to go straight to the Universe.

1211
01:05:45,308 --> 01:05:47,279
I didn't think I'd be picked,

1212
01:05:47,279 --> 01:05:49,279
so I was extremely worried.

1213
01:05:50,348 --> 01:05:53,178
First, the winning team of Sparkling,

1214
01:05:53,178 --> 01:05:54,618
please come up on the stage.

1215
01:05:54,788 --> 01:05:57,089
First, the winning team of Sparkling,

1216
01:05:57,089 --> 01:05:58,558
please come up on the stage.

1217
01:06:06,259 --> 01:06:12,669
(Sparkling Challengers performed "Dolphin" with cheerful energy.)

1218
01:06:14,839 --> 01:06:18,408
They were so good that I didn't realize they were Challengers.

1219
01:06:18,408 --> 01:06:20,678
- That's true. - They did really well.

1220
01:06:20,879 --> 01:06:24,149
(They showed the power of Challengers.)

1221
01:06:25,749 --> 01:06:28,218
- Hello. - Hello.

1222
01:06:28,218 --> 01:06:30,589
(The winner of Sparkling concept, Challengers)

1223
01:06:34,988 --> 01:06:37,759
- I'm so envious. - They're here.

1224
01:06:39,428 --> 01:06:40,529
It's all right.

1225
01:06:41,229 --> 01:06:43,098
They must be really nervous.

1226
01:06:47,509 --> 01:06:50,178
This is harsh. They won.

1227
01:06:50,738 --> 01:06:53,779
They won, but it's not like all of them can be winners.

1228
01:07:08,158 --> 01:07:10,359
All right. I'll announce...

1229
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:13,528
the result of Unicorn Ticketing for the winning team.

1230
01:07:16,368 --> 01:07:20,969
I want to get picked with the "Dolphin" team members.

1231
01:07:20,969 --> 01:07:25,339
So I kept thinking, "I hope we will all make it."

1232
01:07:31,179 --> 01:07:35,049
The contestants to go straight to the Universe are...

1233
01:07:40,658 --> 01:07:41,728
Lee Eunchae.

1234
01:07:42,358 --> 01:07:47,068
(The first contestant advancing to Universe, Lee Eunchae)

1235
01:07:47,629 --> 01:07:48,969
Thank you.

1236
01:07:48,969 --> 01:07:50,499
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

1237
01:07:50,499 --> 01:07:52,868
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

1238
01:07:52,938 --> 01:07:54,408
Thank you.

1239
01:07:55,669 --> 01:07:56,738
Kim Soobin.

1240
01:07:56,978 --> 01:07:58,408
(The second contestant advancing to Universe, Kim Soobin)

1241
01:07:58,408 --> 01:08:00,179
- Thank you. - Congratulations.

1242
01:08:08,349 --> 01:08:09,349
Kotoko.

1243
01:08:09,549 --> 01:08:11,688
(The third contestant advancing to Universe, Kotoko)

1244
01:08:11,688 --> 01:08:13,528
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

1245
01:08:13,528 --> 01:08:15,929
(The third contestant advancing to Universe, Kotoko)

1246
01:08:16,328 --> 01:08:17,698
There's only one left.

1247
01:08:18,228 --> 01:08:19,499
They must be nervous.

1248
01:08:28,438 --> 01:08:29,669
Hwang Sieun.

1249
01:08:30,379 --> 01:08:32,139
(The fourth contestant advancing to Universe, Hwang Sieun)

1250
01:08:32,139 --> 01:08:34,549
Thank you.

01:08:34,549 --> 01:08:35,648
Congratulations.

1252
01:08:43,448 --> 01:08:45,919
The four contestants not chosen by the Unicorns...

1253
01:08:46,288 --> 01:08:48,988
will get a chance to get to the Universe...

1254
01:08:48,988 --> 01:08:52,028
through the Fan Ticketing with the losing teams.

1255
01:08:53,198 --> 01:08:54,469
Thank you for your hard work.

Please go back to your seats.

1259
01:09:00,509 --> 01:09:02,309
- Don't cry. - Don't cry.

1260
01:09:02,309 --> 01:09:03,538
Oh, no.

1261
01:09:06,108 --> 01:09:08,379
This is harder than I thought.

1262
01:09:12,478 --> 01:09:14,749
If I don't get picked here,

1263
01:09:14,749 --> 01:09:16,448
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

1264
01:09:16,448 --> 01:09:17,818
I'll be devastated.

I'm happy for you.

1267
01:09:26,499 --> 01:09:27,528
I'm sorry.

1268
01:09:28,028 --> 01:09:29,568
Why are you crying?

1269
01:09:33,398 --> 01:09:34,908
I'll be there if I can.

1270
01:09:41,249 --> 01:09:42,549
What's wrong?

1271
01:09:46,078 --> 01:09:47,118
Why are you crying?

1272
01:09:48,389 --> 01:09:51,389
I worked really hard.

1273
01:09:57,629 --> 01:09:58,759
I'm all right.

1274
01:10:02,299 --> 01:10:04,398
The winning team of the Cute concept,

1275
01:10:04,398 --> 01:10:05,839
please come up on the stage.

1276
01:10:07,368 --> 01:10:13,379
(Winners, the winning team of the Cute concept)

1277
01:10:14,978 --> 01:10:17,448
How must we pick only four among them?

1278
01:10:21,849 --> 01:10:27,389
(Cute Winners performed "TT" as a perfect girl group.)

1279
01:10:27,459 --> 01:10:30,059
(Every member stood out,)

1280
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:32,959
(and the team gave a performance that was put-together.)

1281
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:34,698
(I want to applaud that.)

1282
01:10:34,698 --> 01:10:38,738
(All members' unique charms could be seen...)

(Challengers performed "DIVA" showing a perfect revenge.)

1312
01:12:18,169 --> 01:12:19,368
(Their teamwork was much better.)

1313
01:12:19,368 --> 01:12:20,469
Indeed.

01:13:39,549 --> 01:13:41,448
It's hard to tell.

1338
01:13:42,089 --> 01:13:43,618
They all did well.

1339
01:13:46,959 --> 01:13:49,589
(Winners performed "Into The New World...")

(by Girls' Generation, Unicorn Hyoyeon's group.)

1341
01:13:54,828 --> 01:13:57,969
(You must've practiced as a group quite a few times.)

1342
01:13:59,269 --> 01:14:02,038
(The group was more in sync than I thought.)

1343
01:14:04,038 --> 01:14:08,978
(They were praised by the original artist, Hyoyeon.)

1344

My gosh.

1365
01:15:50,919 --> 01:15:52,719
I knew you would make it, Huran.

1366
01:15:53,818 --> 01:15:56,148
The winning team of the Charismatic concept,

1367
01:15:56,148 --> 01:15:57,818
please come up on the stage.

1368
01:15:59,919 --> 01:16:01,589
I think both Sujin and Sumin will make it.

1369
01:16:01,589 --> 01:16:03,288
Sujin and Sumin.

1370
01:16:03,288 --> 01:16:05,259
- And Nana? - Probably Yeram?

1371
01:16:05,459 --> 01:16:06,799
Nana and Yeram?

1372
01:16:08,299 --> 01:16:09,799
I have no idea who will make it.

1373
01:16:14,269 --> 01:16:16,509
The contestants to go straight...

1374
01:16:16,509 --> 01:16:18,738
to the Universe through the Unicorn Ticketing are...

1375
01:16:21,049 --> 01:16:24,818
(Showing off their ability at their best,)

1376
01:16:25,719 --> 01:16:30,858
(Charismatic Winners performed "DDU-DU DDU-DU.")

1377
01:16:32,188 --> 01:16:34,688
Each and every one of you caught my eye.

1378
01:16:34,688 --> 01:16:35,889
It's true.

1379
01:16:35,889 --> 01:16:38,828
It's like I rediscovered all of you.

1380
01:16:38,828 --> 01:16:40,999
Those with good reputations lived up to it.

1381
01:16:41,499 --> 01:16:42,568
All of you...

1382
01:16:42,568 --> 01:16:45,738
did such a great job.

1383
01:16:46,639 --> 01:16:49,908
(Winners were highly praised by the Unicorns.)

1384
01:16:49,908 --> 01:16:51,078
You were so cool.

1385
01:16:52,209 --> 01:16:54,509
The contestants to go straight...

1386
01:16:54,509 --> 01:16:56,809
to the Universe through the Unicorn Ticketing are...

1387
01:16:59,078 --> 01:17:00,379
Bae Yeram.

1388
01:17:02,419 --> 01:17:03,549
Bae Yeram.

1389
01:17:03,549 --> 01:17:06,818
(The seventeenth contestant advancing to Universe, Bae Yeram)

1390
01:17:16,169 --> 01:17:17,269

(The eighteenth contestant advancing to Universe, Nizi)

1392
01:17:22,068 --> 01:17:23,438
Kim Sujin.

1393
01:17:23,438 --> 01:17:26,679
(The nineteenth contestant advancing to Universe, Kim Sujin)

1394
01:17:29,209 --> 01:17:32,519
The last Unicorn Ticket goes to...

1395
01:17:32,519 --> 01:17:33,618
(There's only one Unicorn Ticket left.)

1396
01:17:34,188 --> 01:17:36,318
I bet it's Sumin or Nana.

1397
01:17:37,188 --> 01:17:40,618
I really wanted my name to be called.

1398
01:17:41,559 --> 01:17:44,658
And I thought I'd probably be picked.

1399
01:17:46,129 --> 01:17:50,469
I prayed that they would call my name.

1400
01:17:51,568 --> 01:17:54,108
The decision was made only by today's performance.

1401
01:17:56,139 --> 01:17:57,368
It's Jayla.

1402
01:17:57,709 --> 01:17:58,879
It's Jayla.

1403
01:17:58,938 --> 01:18:00,009
Congratulations.

1404
01:18:00,709 --> 01:18:01,778
Congratulations.

(The twentieth contestant advancing to Universe, Jayla)

1406
01:18:03,549 --> 01:18:08,349
(The commentary clips of them will be revealed online.)

1407
01:18:08,849 --> 01:18:11,158
Nana will make it through the Fan Ticketing anyway.

1408
01:18:14,089 --> 01:18:18,599
I'll make sure to make it to the Universe...

1409
01:18:18,599 --> 01:18:21,599
and perform on stage again with the members.

1410
01:18:22,328 --> 01:18:27,398
In the 1st round, I got to rank 11th place.

1411
01:18:27,639 --> 01:18:29,139
So...

1412
01:18:29,139 --> 01:18:33,679
Yes, I'm pretty confident with the global fan votes.

1413
01:18:34,309 --> 01:18:37,379
I'd like to think that I'll be able to come back.

1414
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:39,148
I'll come back.

1415
01:18:42,688 --> 01:18:45,158
Among the 41 contestants to go to the Universe,

1416
01:18:45,389 --> 01:18:47,858

1422
01:19:03,009 --> 01:19:04,339
(It's decided by Fan Ticketing, the global fan votes.)

1423
01:19:05,209 --> 01:19:10,679
Which contestants will meet us again in the Universe?

1424
01:19:11,019 --> 01:19:13,249
We will look forward to meeting them.

1425
01:19:14,688 --> 01:19:16,618
(Fan Ticketing)

1426
01:19:16,618 --> 01:19:18,559
(The first global fan votes: From September 9 to October 10)

1427
01:19:18,559 --> 01:19:20,589
(30 percent of votes on the website and 70 percent on Fancast...)

1428
01:19:20,589 --> 01:19:22,559
(will be combined for the final scores.)

1429
01:19:22,658 --> 01:19:24,089
(A new season after the summer)

1430
01:19:24,089 --> 01:19:27,198
(The new beginning)

1431
01:19:27,198 --> 01:19:31,669
The 20 contestants who made it to the Universe...

1432
01:19:31,669 --> 01:19:34,238
through the Unicorn Ticketing among 82 girls, welcome.

1433
01:19:42,379 --> 01:19:45,719
Now we have 21 seats left in the Universe.

1434
01:19:46,118 --> 01:19:48,049
Who will get to sit in those seats...

1435
01:19:48,049 --> 01:19:49,988
through the Fan Ticketing?

1436
01:19:50,448 --> 01:19:51,589
Who would they be?

1437
01:19:51,688 --> 01:19:53,318
- Who would they be? - Who do you think they are?

1438
01:19:53,488 --> 01:19:54,589
I have no idea.

1439
01:19:54,589 --> 01:19:56,589
I'll now announce the girls who made it to the Universe...

1440
01:19:56,589 --> 01:19:58,599
through the Fan Ticketing.

1441
01:19:59,299 --> 01:20:02,698
(Who's the first contestant to join the Universe?)

1442
01:20:02,698 --> 01:20:04,028
(Universe Ticket)

1443
01:20:04,028 --> 01:20:06,398
(Jin Hyeonju)

1444
01:20:09,969 --> 01:20:11,379
(The first contestant is Jin Hyeonju.)

1445
01:20:11,379 --> 01:20:12,538
It's Hyeonju.

1446
01:20:12,908 --> 01:20:16,009
(18th, Korea, Jin Hyeonju)

1447
01:20:16,209 --> 01:20:18,719
I had this picture in my head...

1448
01:20:18,719 --> 01:20:20,379
about this song, "FIRE."

1449
01:20:21,419 --> 01:20:23,818
(She led Charismatic Challengers...)

1450
01:20:24,019 --> 01:20:25,358
(and showed a successful performance with her outstanding leadership.)

1451
01:20:25,358 --> 01:20:28,028
The winning team is Winners.

1452
01:20:28,028 --> 01:20:31,129
(Unfortunately, she lost her chance to make it to the Universe.)

1453
01:20:32,629 --> 01:20:34,158
(But she came back through the Fan Ticketing.)

1454
01:20:34,158 --> 01:20:36,269
I'll show you how I'll improve.

1455
01:20:36,299 --> 01:20:38,299
Please trust me and look forward to it.

1456
01:20:39,198 --> 01:20:42,269
(Who's the next contestant to make it to the Universe?)

1457
01:20:42,269 --> 01:20:43,568
(Gehlee Dangca)

1458
01:20:44,009 --> 01:20:45,578
(Gehlee Dangca)

1459
01:20:48,478 --> 01:20:50,849
(Gehlee Dangca of Charisma Challengers is here.)

1460
01:20:51,978 --> 01:20:53,078
You're pretty.

1461
01:20:53,148 --> 01:20:55,749
I'm so lucky to have my fans.

1462
01:20:55,749 --> 01:20:57,618
It's like they are my world and my everything.

1463
01:20:57,618 --> 01:20:59,488
I'm really thankful to be here.

1464
01:20:59,658 --> 01:21:02,959
(6th, the Philippines, Gehlee Dangca)

1465
01:21:03,688 --> 01:21:05,299
- Who is it? - Who's next?

1466
01:21:05,299 --> 01:21:06,459
- Who? - Who do you think it is?

1467
01:21:07,198 --> 01:21:11,839
(Bae Haram)

1468
01:21:14,309 --> 01:21:17,809
I'm so happy that I made it with my younger sister.

1469
01:21:18,438 --> 01:21:21,009
(13th, Korea, Bae Haram)

1470
01:21:25,919 --> 01:21:28,849
- My gosh. You look pretty. - You're pretty.

1471
01:21:32,559 --> 01:21:33,959
She's really pretty.

1472
01:21:34,358 --> 01:21:35,929
You're pretty.

1473
01:21:37,089 --> 01:21:40,929
(14th, Japan, Nana)

1474
01:21:41,198 --> 01:21:43,799
The decision was made only by today's performance.

1475
01:21:44,228 --> 01:21:46,438
It's Jayla. Congratulations.

1476
01:21:48,408 --> 01:21:52,408
(Unfortunately, Nana failed to go straight to the Universe.)

1477
01:21:54,078 --> 01:21:58,818
I was really nervous every day.

1478
01:21:58,818 --> 01:22:02,948
So I will work really hard...

1479
01:22:03,049 --> 01:22:06,618
and show you better performances.

1480
01:22:10,028 --> 01:22:11,299
(Kim Sumin)

1481
01:22:13,398 --> 01:22:16,469
(Kim Sumin of Charisma Winners also joins the Universe after Nana.)

1482
01:22:16,499 --> 01:22:18,898
Watching them join the Universe,

1483
01:22:18,999 --> 01:22:20,538
I was really happy.

1484
01:22:20,969 --> 01:22:24,879
I'm getting another chance to try.

1485
01:22:24,879 --> 01:22:27,238
It makes me more determined.

1486
01:22:27,238 --> 01:22:28,608
(12th, Korea, Kim Sumin)

1487
01:22:29,349 --> 01:22:30,679
- I'm curious. - Come on out.

1488
01:22:30,778 --> 01:22:31,978
Who is it?

1489
01:22:32,818 --> 01:22:34,019
I'm so glad.

1490
01:22:35,688 --> 01:22:40,158
(It's Oh Daeun who led Cute Winners to victory.)

1491
01:22:40,158 --> 01:22:41,488
(And Choi Hyerin)

1492
01:22:41,488 --> 01:22:42,959
- You're pretty. - How pretty.

1493
01:22:42,959 --> 01:22:44,499
(It's Oh Daeun and Choi Hyerin who led Cute Winners to victory.)

1494
01:22:48,469 --> 01:22:53,469
(Choi Hyerin caught people's eyes as the opening fairy.)

1495
01:22:54,839 --> 01:22:58,578
(Oh Daeun pulled off the concept brilliantly.)

1496
01:22:59,009 --> 01:23:00,438
They're so good.

1497
01:23:00,509 --> 01:23:01,849
They did well.

1498
01:23:01,978 --> 01:23:04,879
I've been drawing heart after heart next to this person.

1499
01:23:04,879 --> 01:23:06,578
(Unicorn Younha highly praised her.)

1500
01:23:07,278 --> 01:23:10,118
(She proved her ability through the performance.)

1501
01:23:10,849 --> 01:23:13,919
I'm so happy that I got picked.

1502
01:23:13,959 --> 01:23:16,488
I'll show you better performances.

1503
01:23:16,488 --> 01:23:18,059
(3rd, Korea, Choi Hyerin)

1504
01:23:18,059 --> 01:23:19,299
(Choi Hyerin)

1505
01:23:19,299 --> 01:23:20,358
(Kwon Eunhyung)

1506
01:23:23,328 --> 01:23:24,438
This is nice.

1507
01:23:24,438 --> 01:23:27,438
(Another contestant from Cute Winners, Kwon Eunhyung)

1508
01:23:27,438 --> 01:23:28,769
You're so pretty.

1509
01:23:28,938 --> 01:23:31,179
I'm going to get eliminated anyway.

1510
01:23:31,179 --> 01:23:32,908
No way.

1511
01:23:33,038 --> 01:23:38,179
(She lost all her hope and burst into tears.)

1512
01:23:38,818 --> 01:23:40,749
I can't believe...

1513
01:23:40,749 --> 01:23:42,349
- that I'm back. - Come to the center.

1514
01:23:42,349 --> 01:23:43,788
This time,

1515
01:23:43,788 --> 01:23:46,589
I want to get a lot of praises.

1516
01:23:47,158 --> 01:23:51,459
(2nd, Korea, Kwon Eunhyung)

1517
01:23:52,429 --> 01:23:53,499
I'm so glad.

1518
01:23:53,559 --> 01:23:55,398
(Cute Winners congratulate her all together.)

1519
01:23:55,828 --> 01:23:57,969
(Narumi)

1520
01:23:58,238 --> 01:24:00,568
I thought I wanted to show...

1521
01:24:00,639 --> 01:24:03,068
the sides of me that I hadn't shown yet.

1522
01:24:03,068 --> 01:24:05,778
(16th, Japan, Narumi)

1523
01:24:05,778 --> 01:24:08,578
(Vanesya)

1524
01:24:09,179 --> 01:24:12,519
I'm going to do my best for my fans.

1525
01:24:12,519 --> 01:24:15,118
(1st, Indonesia, Vanesya)

1526
01:24:15,948 --> 01:24:18,719
(8th Yona, 19th Aya Natsumi, 10th Park Yewon)

1527
01:24:19,259 --> 01:24:20,889
(15th, Korea, Lee Soovin, 10th, Korea, Heo Sunbin)

1528
01:24:20,889 --> 01:24:22,028
She's so pretty.

1529
01:24:22,658 --> 01:24:25,358
(5th, Myanmar, Riel, 17th, Japan, Minari)

1530
01:24:28,868 --> 01:24:30,228
(The seats are being taken one by one.)

1531
01:24:30,228 --> 01:24:31,799
We don't have many seats left.

1532
01:24:32,198 --> 01:24:33,339
Who's next?

1533
01:24:33,839 --> 01:24:34,938
Who is it?

1534
01:24:37,068 --> 01:24:39,038
(Who's the contestant that shows up in the applause?)

1535
01:24:39,038 --> 01:24:40,238
She's cute.

1536
01:24:43,408 --> 01:24:46,148
- Hi. - She's so pretty.

1537
01:24:46,148 --> 01:24:47,278
When I heard,

1538
01:24:47,278 --> 01:24:48,818
"Elisia got in,"

1539
01:24:48,818 --> 01:24:52,019
I was like... I literally screamed.

1540
01:24:52,019 --> 01:24:53,988
(4th, the Philippines, Elisia)

1541
01:24:54,759 --> 01:24:55,788
She's so pretty.

1542
01:24:55,788 --> 01:24:58,459
People actually do appreciate me. And I feel so loved.

1543
01:24:58,459 --> 01:25:01,368
I'm so thankful for all the support that they've given me.

1544
01:25:02,969 --> 01:25:06,769
(There's only one spot left.)

1545
01:25:06,769 --> 01:25:07,839
Who will it be?

1546
01:25:10,608 --> 01:25:13,108
(To be continued)

1547
01:25:14,395 --> 01:25:18,034
(There's only one spot left.)

1548
01:25:18,034 --> 01:25:19,034
Who will it be?

1549
01:25:25,345 --> 01:25:26,345
All right.

1550
01:25:30,885 --> 01:25:32,555
I was so happy to see her.

1551
01:25:34,614 --> 01:25:39,124
(9th, Korea, Kwon Chaewon)

1552
01:25:40,124 --> 01:25:42,124
(Even if you are lacking,)

1553
01:25:42,124 --> 01:25:44,164
(you should complete the performance.)

1554
01:25:44,965 --> 01:25:47,095
(She received criticisms during the 1-on-1 Battle.)

1555
01:25:47,635 --> 01:25:51,135
(Her team, Pure Winners, won the Revenge Battle.)

1556
01:25:51,565 --> 01:25:55,675
(But her name didn't get called until the end.)

1557
01:25:56,244 --> 01:25:59,515
To be honest, I really wanted my name to be called.

1558
01:26:02,315 --> 01:26:09,185
(She shed tears of disappointment behind the stage.)

1559
01:26:09,484 --> 01:26:11,324
I really wanted to come here.

1560
01:26:11,855 --> 01:26:13,395
I was desperate.

1561
01:26:13,395 --> 01:26:16,295
(I really wanted to come here. I was desperate.)

1562
01:26:17,965 --> 01:26:21,395
I knew that Chaewon struggled a lot,

1563
01:26:21,534 --> 01:26:22,605
so I waited for her.

1564
01:26:23,834 --> 01:26:28,005
I became determined to show my better self.

1565
01:26:29,204 --> 01:26:31,175
Is it over? Everyone is here.

1566
01:26:31,675 --> 01:26:32,944
Everyone is here.

1567
01:26:35,274 --> 01:26:36,715
While I was happy to see other girls,

1568
01:26:37,545 --> 01:26:42,324
a part of me went, "I shouldn't let my guard down."

1569
01:26:42,324 --> 01:26:44,584
I had that thought.

1570
01:26:44,584 --> 01:26:48,295
Only the talented contestants remained.

1571
01:26:48,295 --> 01:26:50,494
It won't be easy to move on to the next round.

1572
01:26:50,494 --> 01:26:52,765
It just made me think that I need to work harder.

1573
01:26:53,765 --> 01:26:55,295
(Among the contestants who passed,)

1574
01:26:55,295 --> 01:26:56,864
(Alyssa and Natchayathorn pulled out due to personal reasons.)

1575
01:26:57,404 --> 01:26:58,664
(Gabi, Goo Gyoryeon, Kim Soobin,)

1576
01:26:58,664 --> 01:26:59,834

1581
01:27:05,074 --> 01:27:06,374

1582
01:27:06,374 --> 01:27:07,715
(Nana, Narumi, Riel, Minari,)

1583
01:27:07,715 --> 01:27:08,984
(Vanesya, Park Yewon, Bae Haram)

1584
01:27:08,984 --> 01:27:10,284
(Aya Natsumi, Elisia, Oh Daeun,)

1585
01:27:10,284 --> 01:27:11,584
(Yona, Lee Soovin, Gehlee Dangca,)

1586
01:27:11,584 --> 01:27:12,855
(Jin Hyeonju, Choi Hyerin, Heo Sunbin)

1587
01:27:13,414 --> 01:27:17,185
The new world you need to enter to debut as a global girl group,

1588
01:27:17,385 --> 01:27:19,024
Universe will open now.

1589
01:27:21,824 --> 01:27:23,265
A new path...

1590
01:27:23,265 --> 01:27:26,534
to the debut that will unfold in Universe, Road to Prism.

1591
01:27:26,534 --> 01:27:27,834
- Miraculous steps. - Prism.

1592
01:27:29,265 --> 01:27:30,534
My goodness.

1593
01:27:33,435 --> 01:27:36,374
In Universe, there are five classes.

1594
01:27:36,374 --> 01:27:38,704
(The classes of Universe)

1595
01:27:38,704 --> 01:27:41,574
Currently, all of you are in Class M.

1596
01:27:42,315 --> 01:27:44,315
Everyone will begin in the same class,

1597
01:27:44,614 --> 01:27:47,114
but only eight members who move up to Class P...

1598
01:27:47,454 --> 01:27:50,055
will acquire the Prism Ticket and debut.

1599
01:27:52,795 --> 01:27:53,795
"How scary."

1600
01:27:53,795 --> 01:27:55,225
"If I fall below that class, will I get eliminated?"

1601
01:27:55,225 --> 01:27:56,694
I had that thought.

1602
01:27:57,295 --> 01:28:01,565
Now, I will reveal the methods you can use to move up the classes.

1603
01:28:02,135 --> 01:28:04,565
The first one is Unicorn Ticketing.

1604
01:28:05,065 --> 01:28:07,234
The second one is Fan Ticketing.

1605
01:28:07,234 --> 01:28:08,635
(Those will determine who move up in each round.)

1606
01:28:08,635 --> 01:28:12,515
If you succeed in both Unicorn and Fan Ticketings,

1607
01:28:12,975 --> 01:28:15,645
you will be able to move up 2 or 3 classes at once.

1608
01:28:16,784 --> 01:28:18,414
- That's incredible. - That's incredible.

1609
01:28:18,784 --> 01:28:21,084
- That's incredible. - The moment you reach Class P,

1610
01:28:21,084 --> 01:28:22,984
your debut will be finalized.

1611
01:28:22,984 --> 01:28:26,994
(The moment they reach Class P, their debut will be finalized.)

1612
01:28:27,494 --> 01:28:32,265
I think it's a good opportunity.

1613
01:28:32,265 --> 01:28:37,105
If I do well, I will be able to move up at once.

1614
01:28:37,635 --> 01:28:40,874
The debut survival to reach Class P,

1615
01:28:41,305 --> 01:28:43,244
Road to Prism will begin now.

1616
01:28:43,244 --> 01:28:46,815
(Debut survival, Road to Prism)

1617
01:28:47,045 --> 01:28:49,084
My hands shook.

1618
01:28:49,185 --> 01:28:51,484
I felt like we were beginning in earnest.

1619
01:28:51,815 --> 01:28:53,055
I was so scared.

1620
01:28:53,755 --> 01:28:57,624
A new path to the debut, Road to Prism.

1621
01:28:58,584 --> 01:29:00,654
I thought it would be an interesting competition.

1622
01:29:00,824 --> 01:29:03,895
A competition for advancement, Level Station.

1623
01:29:04,395 --> 01:29:06,895
(Let's begin the Level Test.)

1624
01:29:06,895 --> 01:29:09,135
(They need a high level to survive.)

1625
01:29:09,635 --> 01:29:11,565
(I wasn't looking for a performance on a music show.)

1626
01:29:11,834 --> 01:29:13,334
(She didn't meet my expectations.)

1627
01:29:14,805 --> 01:29:17,175
(The talented contestants compete against each other...)

1628
01:29:17,175 --> 01:29:19,315
(and make the Level Test fiercer.)

1629
01:29:19,614 --> 01:29:21,744
(Gabi is a bit lacking in comparison, right?)

1630
01:29:23,715 --> 01:29:25,515
(Again)

1631
01:29:25,855 --> 01:29:26,855
(Unsure)

1632
01:29:27,084 --> 01:29:28,954
(In the competition for parts, some girls lose,)

1633
01:29:28,954 --> 01:29:30,954
(while the other girls win.)

1634
01:29:31,185 --> 01:29:34,895
(I think I rank 1st in terms of vocal skills.)

1635
01:29:35,425 --> 01:29:38,395
(Some girls get behind in the class war.)

1636
01:29:41,864 --> 01:29:42,864
(It sounds old.)

1637
01:29:43,465 --> 01:29:45,565
(I think...)

1638
01:29:45,565 --> 01:29:47,574
(my voice suits the song better.)

1639
01:29:47,574 --> 01:29:49,204
(Who can do a kick?)

1640
01:29:49,605 --> 01:29:51,774
(GIrls awaken their ambitions.)

1641
01:29:51,874 --> 01:29:53,015
Don't get it wrong.

1642
01:29:53,215 --> 01:29:54,815
(In order to survive,)

1643
01:29:54,815 --> 01:29:58,284
(they must be more determined.)

1644
01:29:58,515 --> 01:30:00,284
(I can't fall further.)

1645
01:30:00,515 --> 01:30:02,154
(I won't lose.)

1646
01:30:02,315 --> 01:30:03,584
(I want to win...)

1647
01:30:03,584 --> 01:30:05,524
(and move up.)

1648
01:30:05,654 --> 01:30:07,925
(With their improved skills, they give legendary performances.)

1649
01:30:08,355 --> 01:30:11,364
(Which girl will take the lead on the Road to Prism?)

1650
01:30:12,194 --> 01:30:14,095
The dream ticketing for the debut.

1651
01:30:14,635 --> 01:30:16,935
Vote for your favorite girl.

1652
01:30:17,805 --> 01:30:21,074
Participate now on the Universe Ticket homepage...

1653
01:30:21,074 --> 01:30:25,374
and Fancast app for the global vote, Fan Ticketing.

1654
01:30:25,944 --> 01:30:27,515
For the third Fan Ticketing,

1655
01:30:27,744 --> 01:30:30,984
you can cast up to 2 tickets to 1 girl.

1656
01:30:31,515 --> 01:30:33,685
Make sure to reserve a ticket for the girls' dreams.
