The debut survival to reach the PRISM level.

Road to PRISM begins.

5
00:00:16,731 --> 00:00:19,631
There are a total of five levels in the Universe.

6
00:00:20,431 --> 00:00:22,562
Every contestant starts out as the same level.

7
00:00:22,802 --> 00:00:25,172
Only eight contestants can reach the PRISM level...

8
00:00:25,532 --> 00:00:27,942
and make their debut after achieving the PRISM Ticket.

9
00:00:27,942 --> 00:00:28,972
(Only 8 can make their debuts.)

18
00:01:24,092 --> 00:01:26,732
The winning team is Team Attention.

19
00:01:27,032 --> 00:01:29,232
(Winning team 9 promotions, losing team 9 eliminations)

20
00:01:29,532 --> 00:01:32,931
(The 39 girls either felt joy or sorrow.)

21
00:01:34,002 --> 00:01:36,942
(All matches of Level Station are over.)

22
00:01:36,942 --> 00:01:39,881

(Additionally...)

25
00:01:48,651 --> 00:01:52,791
Who will be the one to take a step closer to making their debut?

26
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:54,422
Also,

27
00:01:54,422 --> 00:01:58,832
how many will get eliminated and leave the Universe today?

28
00:02:00,032 --> 00:02:03,172

30
00:02:05,172 --> 00:02:07,371
The First Promotion Ceremony begins now.

31
00:02:07,871 --> 00:02:10,112
- Here we are. - They must feel so nervous.

32
00:02:11,142 --> 00:02:12,912
I think they can reach Level I.

33
00:02:13,112 --> 00:02:15,711
Go!

34
00:02:16,412 --> 00:02:17,512
It's driving me crazy.

35
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:19,112
- Isn't that an error? - No way.

36
00:02:19,412 --> 00:02:21,021
- Gosh, what do we do? - What?

(under a clear sky)

42
00:02:36,102 --> 00:02:38,102
- Where are we? - What is this place?

43
00:02:38,531 --> 00:02:40,202
Hello.

44
00:02:40,471 --> 00:02:41,941

What are we up to now?

49
00:02:56,792 --> 00:02:57,852
I'm so curious.

50
00:02:58,352 --> 00:03:00,362
What is all this? What are we doing here?

51
00:03:00,362 --> 00:03:01,362
(Why have they gathered here instead of the practice rooms?)

52
00:03:01,561 --> 00:03:04,132
I feel like there's going to be something.

53
00:03:04,132 --> 00:03:05,162
It's scary.

54
00:03:05,262 --> 00:03:06,901
I have no idea.

55
00:03:07,202 --> 00:03:08,901
I get anxious now when I come to these places.

56
00:03:09,302 --> 00:03:12,072
- It's scary. - It might be another interim check.

57

64
00:03:30,892 --> 00:03:31,892

65
00:03:31,892 --> 00:03:32,892

We want to provide you all a time of healing today.

72
00:03:47,172 --> 00:03:48,771
A time of healing today.

73
00:03:49,042 --> 00:03:51,142
Healing!

74
00:03:52,172 --> 00:03:53,241
Healing!

75
00:03:53,912 --> 00:03:55,412
I'm getting tearful.

76
00:03:57,512 --> 00:03:58,582
Thank you.

77
00:03:58,681 --> 00:04:00,151
Thank you.

78
00:04:00,382 --> 00:04:01,952
It's heavy.

79

Check this out.

84

- How cute! - Look over here.

101
00:04:55,441 --> 00:04:57,871
I've always wanted to visit the aquarium.

102
00:04:58,112 --> 00:04:59,571
I really loved it.

103
00:05:00,212 --> 00:05:01,641
You can feed them.

104
00:05:01,811 --> 00:05:03,852

- Hi. - I love it here.

107
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:13,991
It has been a while since I've seen fish. I felt really happy.

108
00:05:14,362 --> 00:05:15,991
- Turtles! - Look at them.

109
00:05:16,522 --> 00:05:18,362
- Yes! - Turtles!

110
00:05:18,991 --> 00:05:20,102
Turtles!

111
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:21,501
I'm so happy.

112
00:05:22,862 --> 00:05:24,331
We did it.

113
00:05:24,331 --> 00:05:25,402
Right.

114
00:05:26,371 --> 00:05:29,802
(Recharging energy with a big bite)

115
00:05:29,802 --> 00:05:31,811

Shall we take a look at the pictures we took earlier?

120
00:05:40,782 --> 00:05:41,922
- Yes. - Sounds good!

121
00:05:44,922 --> 00:05:46,552
- It's Narumi. - Narumi.

122
00:05:46,552 --> 00:05:47,592
(The two girls found a picture of Narumi.)

123
00:05:47,592 --> 00:05:49,222
You're so pretty!

124
00:05:49,491 --> 00:05:50,532
Really?

125
00:05:50,532 --> 00:05:51,792
Oh, my gosh.

We were only focused on our performances.

133

It's the best moment.

139
00:06:16,422 --> 00:06:17,991
I wonder what the others are doing.

140
00:06:18,152 --> 00:06:20,321
The cruise and garden?

141
00:06:20,321 --> 00:06:21,561
- The garden. - Right.

142
00:06:21,962 --> 00:06:24,362
They must be enjoying the view on the cruise.

143
00:06:24,362 --> 00:06:25,662
While enjoying good food.

144
00:06:26,232 --> 00:06:27,501

Yes!

149
00:06:33,331 --> 00:06:34,342
Get in.

150
00:06:34,741 --> 00:06:36,172
(Photos are a must. The cruise members are busy taking pictures.)

151
00:06:38,042 --> 00:06:39,871
(They take photos of each other...)

152
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,181
(and take photos together.)

153
00:06:41,181 --> 00:06:42,511

Keep your eyes open.

158
00:06:50,751 --> 00:06:53,491
You have to stay still like that.

An electric cruise.

169
00:07:22,181 --> 00:07:24,292
I've only heard of electric cars.

170
00:07:24,292 --> 00:07:27,092
It's fascinating to see an electric ship.

171
00:07:27,092 --> 00:07:30,831
Normal ships should be shaking as we're moving.

172
00:07:30,831 --> 00:07:33,602
Doesn't it feel electric though? It's a smooth ride.

173
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:35,261
It's fast but quiet.

174
00:07:35,261 --> 00:07:36,302
Right.

(They all enjoy their ramyeon.)

186
00:08:00,391 --> 00:08:02,321
- It's quite spicy. - It's good.

187
00:08:02,321 --> 00:08:04,162
- Enjoy your food. - I feel so happy.

188
00:08:04,162 --> 00:08:06,691
(This is a true time of healing.)

189
00:08:07,102 --> 00:08:08,431
It's warm.

190
00:08:09,631 --> 00:08:11,931
I'm so excited for today.

191
00:08:12,071 --> 00:08:14,542
I wonder what they're doing in the garden. Sightseeing?

192
00:08:16,701 --> 00:08:18,342
It's already beautiful.

193
00:08:18,342 --> 00:08:19,542
- It's beautiful. - It's beautiful.

194
00:08:20,212 --> 00:08:21,681
- It's so beautiful. - Butterflies.

195
00:08:21,681 --> 00:08:23,181
- It's so big. - Look up there.

196
00:08:23,181 --> 00:08:24,212
Look over there.

197
00:08:24,581 --> 00:08:25,652
It's so beautiful.

198
00:08:26,112 --> 00:08:27,522
Where's the flower?

199
00:08:27,522 --> 00:08:29,382
- I'm the flower. - I'm the flower.

200
00:08:29,382 --> 00:08:31,351
- No! - It's me!

201
00:08:31,351 --> 00:08:32,922
You're a butterfly.

202
00:08:32,922 --> 00:08:34,321
- You're a caterpillar. - Caterpillar.

203
00:08:34,691 --> 00:08:36,392
(The older girls think the young ones are cute.)

204
00:08:36,392 --> 00:08:37,662
I love it here.

205
00:08:37,662 --> 00:08:39,361
- How cute. It's beautiful here. - I'm a butterfly.

206
00:08:39,731 --> 00:08:41,002
Who wants to take pictures?

207
00:08:41,002 --> 00:08:42,032
I do!

208
00:08:43,502 --> 00:08:46,331
- Eunchae, you look pretty. - In 1, 2, 3.

209
00:08:47,441 --> 00:08:48,441
Eunchae looks so pretty.

210
00:08:48,441 --> 00:08:49,672
- The photo came out nicely. - Right.

211
00:08:50,142 --> 00:08:51,341
Thanks!

212
00:08:52,311 --> 00:08:53,372
It's so pretty.

213
00:08:53,782 --> 00:08:55,941
Look over there. It's so pretty.

214
00:08:55,941 --> 00:08:58,012
(The pretty flower tunnel caught Nana's attention.)

215
00:08:58,012 --> 00:08:59,152
Right here.

216
00:08:59,282 --> 00:09:01,122
It's perfect for Gehlee.

217
00:09:05,252 --> 00:09:06,922
(Time of healing, Minari and Gehlee Danca)

218
00:09:07,091 --> 00:09:11,561
I got to see many different flowers. I loved it.

219
00:09:14,802 --> 00:09:16,361
It's so bright out here.

220
00:09:16,361 --> 00:09:18,132
(As they move in deeper...)

221
00:09:18,132 --> 00:09:19,902
- It's beautiful. - It really is.

222
00:09:20,172 --> 00:09:21,542
It's beautiful.

223
00:09:21,802 --> 00:09:23,002
This is amazing.

224
00:09:24,172 --> 00:09:25,672
- Gehlee. - Yes?

225
00:09:25,941 --> 00:09:27,882
What color do you like?

226
00:09:28,181 --> 00:09:29,681
- Pink! - Pink?

227
00:09:30,252 --> 00:09:31,451
Let's take pictures with the pink flowers.

228
00:09:32,611 --> 00:09:34,721
- Pink! - It's lovely.

229
00:09:34,721 --> 00:09:35,752
(Nana's camera)

230
00:09:36,052 --> 00:09:38,622
These flowers are all begonias.

231
00:09:38,622 --> 00:09:40,022
- Begonia? - Aren't they so pretty?

232
00:09:40,022 --> 00:09:42,191
- Begonia. - Shall we take some pictures here?

233
00:09:42,191 --> 00:09:43,262
- Yes. - Sounds good.

234
00:09:43,262 --> 00:09:44,361
In 1, 2, 3.

235
00:09:45,162 --> 00:09:46,191
(Begonia garden)

236
00:09:46,191 --> 00:09:48,802
(The flower that sends love)

237
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:51,802
How can we enjoy our time here?

238
00:09:51,802 --> 00:09:52,872
What's this?

239
00:09:52,872 --> 00:09:55,341
- Red Light, Green Light - That looks nice.

240
00:09:55,471 --> 00:09:57,311
- Red Light, Green Light! - Yes!

241
00:09:57,311 --> 00:09:58,672
That sounds like fun.

242
00:09:58,672 --> 00:10:00,242
- Can I be it? - With the begonias.

243
00:10:00,242 --> 00:10:01,382
Sounds good.

244
00:10:02,181 --> 00:10:04,081
I think you can call out missions, Seowon.

245
00:10:04,081 --> 00:10:05,152
Missions?

246
00:10:05,152 --> 00:10:06,512
Were there missions?

247
00:10:06,512 --> 00:10:07,622
(You must make the mission pose chosen by the tagger to pass!)

248
00:10:07,622 --> 00:10:09,282
- Okay. - I'm ready.

249
00:10:09,821 --> 00:10:11,191
Begonia Light

250
00:10:12,922 --> 00:10:14,292
(Flower cups)

251
00:10:14,622 --> 00:10:15,662
(Flower cups)

252
00:10:15,662 --> 00:10:17,191
Doesn't Sunwoo have to go?

253
00:10:17,662 --> 00:10:18,762
(Come here.)

254
00:10:19,032 --> 00:10:20,331
Take it slow with easy ones.

255
00:10:20,502 --> 00:10:22,061
Cat Light

256
00:10:22,061 --> 00:10:23,802
- Cat! - Cat?

257
00:10:23,802 --> 00:10:24,831
Is that a cat, Gehlee?

258
00:10:25,331 --> 00:10:27,571
- Gehlee! - Those are horns.

259
00:10:27,701 --> 00:10:29,341
- What's this, Gehlee? - What have I done?

260
00:10:29,341 --> 00:10:30,372
Gehlee!

261
00:10:30,372 --> 00:10:31,772
- Haram Light. - Haram.

262
00:10:31,772 --> 00:10:33,941
Haram Light

263
00:10:33,941 --> 00:10:36,181
Haram Light

264
00:10:36,181 --> 00:10:38,382
- Nice! - Nice!

265
00:10:38,382 --> 00:10:39,681
That's her.

266
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:40,981
I want to take a look.

267
00:10:40,981 --> 00:10:42,752
What's your pose? I'm really curious.

268
00:10:42,752 --> 00:10:44,851
During the 1-on-1 Battle,

269
00:10:44,851 --> 00:10:45,992
she looked amazing doing this.

270
00:10:45,992 --> 00:10:47,691
You can't move. Please come this way.

271
00:10:47,961 --> 00:10:49,221
Eunchae moved.

272
00:10:49,762 --> 00:10:51,132
(Eunchae got tricked by Seowon.)

273
00:10:52,231 --> 00:10:53,861
Haram is Haram. You're right.

274
00:10:54,502 --> 00:10:56,561
Nana Light

275
00:10:57,802 --> 00:10:59,302
(She makes a quick exit.)

276
00:10:59,302 --> 00:11:00,642
It's "Gashina."

277
00:11:00,642 --> 00:11:02,201
- What pose is that, Minari? - What's that?

278
00:11:02,672 --> 00:11:03,872
What was that?

279
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:05,012
(Moving)

280
00:11:06,311 --> 00:11:08,382
I'll give you another chance because you were cute.

281
00:11:08,382 --> 00:11:09,481
She's so cute.

282
00:11:10,351 --> 00:11:11,782
I'll call myself for the next one.

283
00:11:11,782 --> 00:11:14,252
- Im Seowon Light - It's Seowon.

284
00:11:14,252 --> 00:11:16,981
Im Seowon Light

285
00:11:18,152 --> 00:11:19,652
- What's that? - They're doing the same pose.

286
00:11:19,652 --> 00:11:21,662
That was so cute!

287
00:11:22,321 --> 00:11:23,591
They're exactly the same.

288
00:11:23,762 --> 00:11:25,392
Red Light, Green Light

289
00:11:25,392 --> 00:11:26,892
I really enjoyed the game.

290
00:11:28,561 --> 00:11:30,701
I played games with my friends.

291
00:11:30,971 --> 00:11:32,701
It's been a while...

292
00:11:33,132 --> 00:11:35,441
since I enjoyed an exciting time of healing.

293
00:11:36,841 --> 00:11:40,042
(We hope everyone felt recharged during this time!)

294
00:11:40,441 --> 00:11:43,181
Did you all have a great time? How was it?

295
00:11:43,181 --> 00:11:46,512
- We loved it! - We loved it!

296
00:11:46,512 --> 00:11:48,622
We had great food.

297
00:11:48,622 --> 00:11:50,992
- We saw fish. - We fed them too.

298
00:11:50,992 --> 00:11:53,152
We had ramyeon on a cruise!

299
00:11:53,152 --> 00:11:55,321
We were on a cruise.

300
00:11:55,321 --> 00:11:57,492
We had ramyeon on a cruise.

301
00:11:58,331 --> 00:12:01,231
Universe Camp isn't over yet.

302
00:12:01,231 --> 00:12:03,802
I will now reveal Universe Camp's...

303
00:12:03,802 --> 00:12:05,931
special event.

304
00:12:07,002 --> 00:12:08,302
- Special event? - What?

305
00:12:09,101 --> 00:12:11,172
Event? What could it be?

306
00:12:11,172 --> 00:12:12,672
Universe Ticket...

307
00:12:12,672 --> 00:12:15,642
was invited to perform during "SBS Entertainment Awards."

308
00:12:16,542 --> 00:12:17,611
- Really? - Really?

309
00:12:17,752 --> 00:12:19,481
- No way. - "SBS Entertainment Awards?"

310
00:12:19,481 --> 00:12:20,681
- Oh, my gosh. - Is this true?

311
00:12:20,951 --> 00:12:22,821
("2022 SBS Entertainment Awards")

312
00:12:23,122 --> 00:12:26,892
(A festival for entertainers, "SBS Entertainment Awards")

313
00:12:28,221 --> 00:12:34,061
(Only top idol stars performed every year.)

314
00:12:36,101 --> 00:12:37,302
The year-end show?

315
00:12:38,032 --> 00:12:39,632
- My goodness. - This is amazing.

316
00:12:41,601 --> 00:12:44,211
However, not everyone...

317
00:12:44,211 --> 00:12:46,441
can perform for the show.

318
00:12:47,111 --> 00:12:48,611
- Please. - No!

319
00:12:48,611 --> 00:12:50,652
Nothing is easy here.

320
00:12:50,951 --> 00:12:53,481
The number of members who can go up on stage...

321
00:12:54,122 --> 00:12:55,552
is just eight.

322
00:12:56,351 --> 00:12:58,591
- Is just 8. - Just 8?

323
00:12:59,591 --> 00:13:00,821
This is driving me crazy.

324
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,591
(Only 8 girls out of 30 can perform during the show.)

325
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,931
What's going on?

326
00:13:03,931 --> 00:13:05,532
I thought this was a time of healing.

327
00:13:05,632 --> 00:13:06,691
Exactly.

328
00:13:07,361 --> 00:13:10,971
The song you will perform is the first signal song,

329
00:13:10,971 --> 00:13:13,532
"Want to Come With Me?"

330
00:13:14,242 --> 00:13:16,642
There's a special mission just for the awards show.

331
00:13:16,772 --> 00:13:18,242
From the original song,

332
00:13:18,242 --> 00:13:21,382
you will be given a 20-second part...

333
00:13:21,382 --> 00:13:23,382
that you must come up with on your own.

334
00:13:23,382 --> 00:13:27,012
(They must come up with a dance break for the song.)

335
00:13:27,012 --> 00:13:29,052
- On our own? - This is amazing.

336
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,691
- We're doing this all the way here? - I knew it.

337
00:13:32,691 --> 00:13:33,752
(A creative dance break mission for "SBS Entertainment Awards")

338
00:13:34,691 --> 00:13:39,262
(Universe Ticket's signal song one, "Want to Come With Me?")

339
00:13:41,262 --> 00:13:44,872
(Dance break session)

340
00:13:44,931 --> 00:13:49,042
(This mission requires them to create a 20-second dance part.)

341
00:13:49,471 --> 00:13:52,841
(How will the girls' dance breaks turn out to be?)

342
00:13:52,841 --> 00:13:55,512
The ten members who enjoyed the same spot...

343
00:13:55,512 --> 00:13:58,152
will prepare for the performance as a team.

344
00:13:58,152 --> 00:14:00,652
Tomorrow morning at 11am, here at this spot,

345
00:14:00,652 --> 00:14:03,681
we will decide the eight members who will perform.

346
00:14:04,191 --> 00:14:05,252
No way.

347
00:14:05,851 --> 00:14:09,961
I really want to experience "SBS Entertainment Awards."

348
00:14:09,961 --> 00:14:13,591
It's a truly special opportunity to be on "SBS Entertainment Awards."

349
00:14:13,591 --> 00:14:15,662
And that's even before making my debut.

350
00:14:15,662 --> 00:14:19,002
I thought I mustn't lose this chance.

351
00:14:19,002 --> 00:14:22,201
I think I am worthy of representing Universe Ticket.

352
00:14:22,341 --> 00:14:25,772
Now that I'm in the top 30, I want to achieve even more.

353
00:14:25,772 --> 00:14:29,542
I really wanted to be a part of the eight members on stage.

354
00:14:29,642 --> 00:14:32,311
(Time given to practice from now: Just 3 hours)

355
00:14:32,481 --> 00:14:33,951
Anyone here confident in creating dance parts?

356
00:14:34,581 --> 00:14:36,451
- Anyone with experience. - Anyone who has tried it.

357
00:14:36,451 --> 00:14:37,951
- I've tried. - I've tried too.

358
00:14:37,951 --> 00:14:39,022
You've given it a try.

359
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:41,522
Shall we let these four be in charge?

360
00:14:41,522 --> 00:14:43,591
- Sounds good. - They have the experience.

361
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,961
- Make it easy to do but seem difficult from an outsider's perspective. - Right.

362
00:14:46,162 --> 00:14:47,502
Easy but fancy.

363
00:14:47,502 --> 00:14:48,802
A memorable performance.

364
00:14:48,802 --> 00:14:50,201
I have quite a lot of experience...

365
00:14:50,201 --> 00:14:55,841
in coming up with my own performances.

366
00:14:55,841 --> 00:14:57,971
I felt quite confident.

367
00:14:57,971 --> 00:14:59,441
We have 20 seconds.

368
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:01,782
The first part will be 10 seconds and the last part 10 seconds.

369
00:15:01,782 --> 00:15:03,211
- We'll separate them. - That's what we'll do.

370
00:15:03,211 --> 00:15:05,782
Can anyone come up with cute dance moves?

371
00:15:06,081 --> 00:15:07,451
- Me! - Yes!

372
00:15:07,451 --> 00:15:08,782
How cute.

373
00:15:09,122 --> 00:15:10,892
Anyone who can come up with cool dance moves?

374
00:15:10,892 --> 00:15:11,951
- Me! - Me!

375
00:15:12,552 --> 00:15:14,091
- We have quite a lot. - That's a lot.

376
00:15:14,321 --> 00:15:17,022
Then let's work together.

377
00:15:17,022 --> 00:15:19,461
It wasn't our first time hearing the song.

378
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:21,961
We were already very familiar with the song.

379
00:15:21,961 --> 00:15:23,931
I thought we had a great chance to take the part.

380
00:15:24,231 --> 00:15:27,441
It'll be hard for everyone to come up with the part together.

381
00:15:27,571 --> 00:15:29,772
- We don't have enough time. - We don't have enough time.

382
00:15:29,902 --> 00:15:31,941
We should all split up.

383
00:15:31,941 --> 00:15:34,841
We can share our ideas after working on them.

384
00:15:35,211 --> 00:15:37,111
I think that'll be easier for us with the time we have.

385
00:15:37,111 --> 00:15:38,382
What do you all think?

386
00:15:38,382 --> 00:15:39,611
- Sounds great. - I like that idea.

387
00:15:40,152 --> 00:15:41,782
It's okay. We can do it.

388
00:15:41,782 --> 00:15:42,951
Yes. We can do it.

389
00:15:42,951 --> 00:15:45,591
- It can't be too hard. - We must use our time wisely.

390
00:15:45,721 --> 00:15:47,122
It must be done quickly.

391
00:15:48,691 --> 00:15:53,792
(Which 8 girls will make it to "SBS Entertainment Awards?")

392
00:15:56,701 --> 00:15:58,532
- They're preparing something? - Someone is here.

393
00:15:59,272 --> 00:16:00,532
It must be a guest.

394
00:16:07,111 --> 00:16:08,681
- We can do it. - Yes.

395
00:16:08,681 --> 00:16:10,912
- Let's go! We can do it. - We can do it.

396
00:16:11,052 --> 00:16:12,652
- Don't worry. - Right.

397
00:16:15,851 --> 00:16:17,422
Hello!

398
00:16:17,522 --> 00:16:19,851
- Hello, everyone. - Hello.

399
00:16:19,851 --> 00:16:21,022
(A special guest gets them up from their seats.)

400
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:23,561
- Hello, everyone! - Hello.

401
00:16:24,492 --> 00:16:26,492
I'm the choreography creator of "Want to Come With Me?"

402
00:16:26,492 --> 00:16:27,831
I'm Bell.

403
00:16:28,632 --> 00:16:31,431
(The creator of the choreography of "Want to Come With Me?")

404
00:16:32,071 --> 00:16:35,772
(Universe Ticket's representative dance trainer)

405
00:16:35,772 --> 00:16:36,941
More!

406
00:16:38,242 --> 00:16:39,872
Have you been practicing a lot?

407
00:16:39,872 --> 00:16:40,981
- Yes. - Yes.

408
00:16:40,981 --> 00:16:42,042
I'm excited.

409
00:16:42,542 --> 00:16:45,211
I'm here to decide the eight members...

410
00:16:45,211 --> 00:16:48,882
who will perform for "SBS Entertainment Awards."

411
00:16:51,792 --> 00:16:52,792
Gosh, I feel so nervous.

412
00:16:52,792 --> 00:16:55,191
Of course it is important...

413
00:16:55,191 --> 00:16:58,231
to have good choreography and show nice moves.

414
00:16:58,492 --> 00:17:01,661
But what's more important is to show off your talents and charms.

415
00:17:01,802 --> 00:17:04,571
That's the evaluation standards.

416
00:17:04,571 --> 00:17:06,631
Okay? Good luck.

417
00:17:06,631 --> 00:17:08,571
- Let's do this. - Let's do this.

418
00:17:11,742 --> 00:17:13,212
I'm feeling nervous again.

419
00:17:13,212 --> 00:17:14,881
I know. We can do this.

420
00:17:15,742 --> 00:17:17,141
All right.

421
00:17:17,212 --> 00:17:18,351
Let's start with the first team.

422
00:17:18,581 --> 00:17:19,811
Team Aqua.

423
00:17:19,811 --> 00:17:21,752
(Team Aqua is up first.)

424
00:17:22,222 --> 00:17:23,222
No.

425
00:17:24,292 --> 00:17:25,651
- Good luck. - Please come forward.

426
00:17:25,651 --> 00:17:26,722
- Good luck. - Good luck.

427
00:17:26,722 --> 00:17:27,792
Good luck.

428
00:17:27,792 --> 00:17:30,022
All right. The first team will come forward.

429
00:17:31,462 --> 00:17:32,992
- Good luck. - Good luck.

430
00:17:32,992 --> 00:17:34,202
You can do this.

431
00:17:34,861 --> 00:17:36,561
- I'm excited. - Let's do this.

432
00:17:38,302 --> 00:17:40,901
All right. Please stand in line.

433
00:17:40,901 --> 00:17:42,341
Please stand in the center.

434
00:17:42,371 --> 00:17:45,141
Kotoko and Yui.

435
00:17:45,712 --> 00:17:48,381
Does your team have anything I need to focus on?

436
00:17:48,881 --> 00:17:52,052
We will do the dance break as different units.

437
00:17:52,081 --> 00:17:54,581
We're divided into units...

438
00:17:54,581 --> 00:17:56,682
with a cute theme and a charismatic theme.

439
00:17:56,682 --> 00:17:59,121
We divided ourselves into two units...

440
00:17:59,121 --> 00:18:01,222
to show our charms better.

441
00:18:01,222 --> 00:18:02,591
(They will double their charms with two different themes.)

442
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:05,992
Do you have any idea?

443
00:18:06,462 --> 00:18:09,561
Do you have anything in mind? What do you want to do?

444
00:18:10,002 --> 00:18:11,631
- Anything? - I have one.

445
00:18:12,071 --> 00:18:15,302
We have to share our ideas.

446
00:18:18,141 --> 00:18:20,042
I keep thinking about the original dance moves.

447
00:18:20,042 --> 00:18:22,282
- This is bad. - I'm trying to forget it.

448
00:18:22,542 --> 00:18:23,611
I'm in trouble.

449
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:26,012
(They are used to the original moves,)

450
00:18:26,012 --> 00:18:30,722
(so they have a hard time coming up with new ones.)

451
00:18:31,552 --> 00:18:33,052
It's hard to look cute.

452
00:18:33,052 --> 00:18:34,161
Don't worry.

453
00:18:34,222 --> 00:18:36,692
The cool dance of the five...

454
00:18:37,421 --> 00:18:38,432
should be about technique.

455
00:18:38,432 --> 00:18:40,032
It goes like this.

456
00:18:43,002 --> 00:18:44,061
It's like this.

457
00:18:45,772 --> 00:18:50,202
(Narumi comes up with new ideas without hesitation.)

458
00:18:51,042 --> 00:18:53,841
I thought Narumi would be good.

459
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,682
She gets things done well within a short period of time.

460
00:18:55,841 --> 00:18:59,411
I think she's good at missions that need to be finished in a day.

461
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:04,192
(Kim Sumin gives it some thought alone.)

462
00:19:04,192 --> 00:19:07,621
Why don't we make contact here?

463
00:19:07,621 --> 00:19:08,692
Something like this.

464
00:19:08,692 --> 00:19:10,421
"Hey." And then...

465
00:19:10,421 --> 00:19:12,131
It goes like this,

466
00:19:12,131 --> 00:19:13,692
and we look at each other.

467
00:19:13,692 --> 00:19:16,302
- Then we dance like this. - I like that.

468
00:19:16,331 --> 00:19:17,732
Good.

469
00:19:17,732 --> 00:19:20,671
- I like that. - Good idea.

470
00:19:20,671 --> 00:19:22,972
Should we do that as we stand up?

471
00:19:22,972 --> 00:19:24,911
- Then... Two. - It starts with the front row.

472
00:19:24,911 --> 00:19:25,911
(Will they be able to show their two different charms in 20 seconds?)

473
00:19:25,911 --> 00:19:27,171
- All right. - Let's do this.

474
00:19:27,171 --> 00:19:28,341
- We can do this. - We can do this.

475
00:19:28,811 --> 00:19:30,111
I'm excited.

476
00:19:30,952 --> 00:19:32,311
They must feel nervous.

477
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:42,591
(The original choreography is changed to a symmetric formation.)

478
00:19:42,861 --> 00:19:46,631
(They try something new even for a part that's not for freestyle.)

479
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:58,641
(They dance in unison for the basic part.)

480
00:20:01,442 --> 00:20:02,482
They're good.

481
00:20:06,252 --> 00:20:10,921
(The freestyle part of Team Aqua starts.)

482
00:20:15,792 --> 00:20:18,992
(The cute unit's turn to dance.)

483
00:20:22,002 --> 00:20:23,601
(They look even cuter with a jump.)

484
00:20:23,601 --> 00:20:24,702
She's cute.

485
00:20:34,341 --> 00:20:37,141
(The unit with the cool dance steps up.)

486
00:20:50,462 --> 00:20:52,391
Narumi is legendary.

487
00:20:53,032 --> 00:20:56,161
- What's that? They're so cool. - It's amazing.

488
00:20:56,161 --> 00:20:58,272
I didn't know "Want to Come With Me?" could be so cool.

489
00:21:03,341 --> 00:21:04,411
Well done.

490
00:21:06,442 --> 00:21:09,482
They're good. They did well.

491
00:21:09,782 --> 00:21:11,052
Even the ending was cute.

492
00:21:11,052 --> 00:21:12,512
Thank you for your performance.

493
00:21:12,512 --> 00:21:14,052
You did very well.

494
00:21:14,052 --> 00:21:16,121
I liked Kotoko's jump.

495
00:21:16,222 --> 00:21:19,091
And I liked the powerful flow of the cool unit.

496
00:21:19,091 --> 00:21:22,962
It's good that you showed the powerful and cute charms well.

497
00:21:23,321 --> 00:21:25,292
- Thank you. - Thank you.

498
00:21:25,631 --> 00:21:28,762
- I think they're really cool. - It was great.

499
00:21:29,532 --> 00:21:31,901
How could they come up with such an idea for the song?

500
00:21:32,901 --> 00:21:35,202
Next up is Team Garden.

501
00:21:35,202 --> 00:21:37,371
Team Garden, please come forward.

502
00:21:37,641 --> 00:21:38,942
Good luck.

503
00:21:39,212 --> 00:21:40,811
You got this!

504
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,341
It's a team with members...

505
00:21:42,341 --> 00:21:43,841
- who look like a garden. - I know.

506
00:21:43,841 --> 00:21:46,381
- They're perfect for the team name. - They are pretty and pure.

507
00:21:48,782 --> 00:21:50,182
Team Garden.

508
00:21:50,952 --> 00:21:52,891
For the dance break,

509
00:21:53,321 --> 00:21:57,391
we came up with the dance with a narrative arc.

510
00:21:57,462 --> 00:21:59,732
I think we will show our energy...

511
00:21:59,732 --> 00:22:02,101
that's perfect for this song.

512
00:22:02,101 --> 00:22:05,131
- Please keep that in mind. - Okay.

513
00:22:05,131 --> 00:22:08,242
All right. Let's do it to the song from the start.

514
00:22:08,242 --> 00:22:10,101
We will just check the details.

515
00:22:10,802 --> 00:22:12,871
Can we try the dance break once?

516
00:22:12,871 --> 00:22:14,141
- It's no problem. - Okay.

517
00:22:14,442 --> 00:22:17,752
(The first half of the dance break, Seowon and Gabi)

518
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:19,282
Let's do this.

519
00:22:21,651 --> 00:22:24,522
I think I'm quite good at this.

520
00:22:24,591 --> 00:22:26,752
It's cool and suits the song well.

521
00:22:27,522 --> 00:22:29,522
I think I came up with good ones.

522
00:22:29,522 --> 00:22:30,962
(She's proud of her work.)

523
00:22:31,091 --> 00:22:32,631
(The second half of the dance break, Gyoryeon and Haram)

524
00:22:32,631 --> 00:22:33,861
That looks cool.

525
00:22:34,861 --> 00:22:37,732
(They show powerful moves that are different from the first half.)

526
00:22:37,732 --> 00:22:39,772
- Okay. - Thank you.

527
00:22:39,772 --> 00:22:40,871
Great job.

528
00:22:40,871 --> 00:22:42,171
- That's cool. - It's great.

529
00:22:42,171 --> 00:22:43,341
This is too difficult.

530
00:22:43,341 --> 00:22:45,111
- It's nice. - We can do this.

531
00:22:45,272 --> 00:22:47,071
It's nice, but it's a little difficult.

532
00:22:47,071 --> 00:22:49,442
- It is, right? - We will need some time.

533
00:22:49,442 --> 00:22:51,512
It's hard to get it done within a day.

534
00:22:51,952 --> 00:22:53,552
But the starting part looks pretty.

535
00:22:53,552 --> 00:22:54,982
Yes, it looks pretty.

536
00:22:54,982 --> 00:22:56,682
- But this is difficult. - We can make it easier.

537
00:22:56,682 --> 00:22:58,121
Okay. I get it.

538
00:22:58,552 --> 00:23:01,391
It takes me a long time to learn new dance moves.

539
00:23:01,522 --> 00:23:04,292
I'm worried I might not be able to memorize it in time.

540
00:23:05,192 --> 00:23:08,401
(It's not just the freestyle part.)

541
00:23:08,401 --> 00:23:10,262
One, two. And...

542
00:23:10,462 --> 00:23:13,202
We will divide ourselves into two.

543
00:23:13,202 --> 00:23:15,071
This half will swing their arms this way.

544
00:23:15,442 --> 00:23:16,841
No.

545
00:23:16,841 --> 00:23:18,311
(It suddenly becomes more difficult.)

546
00:23:18,311 --> 00:23:20,272
It remains the same for you guys.

547
00:23:20,272 --> 00:23:22,881
One, two, three, four. And...

548
00:23:22,881 --> 00:23:25,151
This team will go the other way around.

549
00:23:25,552 --> 00:23:27,782
- Do we have to do this? - My gosh.

550
00:23:27,782 --> 00:23:29,222
- I want to make it look pretty. - Seriously.

551
00:23:29,222 --> 00:23:30,682
- I worked hard to memorize this. - We can do this, Gabi.

552
00:23:30,682 --> 00:23:31,891
- Is it confusing? - Do you find it hard?

553
00:23:31,891 --> 00:23:34,052
- It's really confusing. - You can do this.

554
00:23:34,091 --> 00:23:35,192
Fold your arms like this.

555
00:23:35,361 --> 00:23:37,561
- Then move your leg this way. - Okay.

556
00:23:37,561 --> 00:23:38,861
- Spin like this. - Okay.

557
00:23:38,891 --> 00:23:40,462
Then go like this.

558
00:23:41,262 --> 00:23:43,901
Can't we just stick with the old one?

559
00:23:43,901 --> 00:23:45,032
This looks better though.

560
00:23:45,032 --> 00:23:46,871
- It does look pretty. - I think it looks better this way,

561
00:23:46,871 --> 00:23:48,242
so I want to go the other way around.

562
00:23:48,242 --> 00:23:49,702
- I'll do it then. - Are you okay with that?

563
00:23:49,742 --> 00:23:51,671
- Then go like this. - It's confusing,

564
00:23:51,671 --> 00:23:52,811
but I'll do it.

565
00:23:54,212 --> 00:23:56,942
(Gabi is having a hard time catching up.)

566
00:23:56,942 --> 00:23:58,212
Gabi, it's all right. You can do this.

567
00:23:58,452 --> 00:24:01,012
You got this. Don't be negative. Let's stay positive.

568
00:24:01,012 --> 00:24:02,151
- Okay. - We can do this.

569
00:24:02,151 --> 00:24:03,881
- Let's try it again slowly. - Three, four.

570
00:24:04,022 --> 00:24:05,351
I felt pressured.

571
00:24:05,851 --> 00:24:07,321
I wasn't confident.

572
00:24:09,022 --> 00:24:10,561
I'm not sure.

573
00:24:14,032 --> 00:24:16,661
Here... I'm sorry. Let's try it again.

574
00:24:16,661 --> 00:24:18,002
- Let's do it again. - I'm sorry.

575
00:24:18,002 --> 00:24:19,331
- It's okay. - All right.

576
00:24:19,331 --> 00:24:21,071
Check the moves. Let's take it slow.

577
00:24:27,712 --> 00:24:28,712
Hey.

578
00:24:28,712 --> 00:24:30,641
Step back.

579
00:24:31,851 --> 00:24:32,982
- My gosh. - Are you all right?

580
00:24:32,982 --> 00:24:34,081
Where did you stop?

581
00:24:34,351 --> 00:24:35,982
- At the beginning. - The beginning?

582
00:24:36,081 --> 00:24:38,252
- Let's do it again slowly. - Okay.

583
00:24:38,252 --> 00:24:41,292
Five, six, seven, and eight.

584
00:24:41,292 --> 00:24:43,621
One, two, three, four.

585
00:24:43,621 --> 00:24:47,161
(They keep making mistakes.)

586
00:24:47,631 --> 00:24:49,262
One, two.

587
00:24:49,401 --> 00:24:53,302
(Will they be able to pull off the difficult freestyle part?)

588
00:24:53,302 --> 00:24:54,841
- Let's do this. - Let's do this.

589
00:24:56,101 --> 00:24:58,411
- I'm excited about this team. - Please start once you're ready.

590
00:24:58,411 --> 00:25:00,042
They have many good members.

591
00:25:01,182 --> 00:25:02,411
Good luck.

592
00:25:08,982 --> 00:25:10,782
The talented ones are in the center.

593
00:25:13,492 --> 00:25:15,462
Seowon is so good with her facial expressions.

594
00:25:23,101 --> 00:25:27,071
(The freestyle part of Team Garden starts.)

595
00:25:35,141 --> 00:25:39,581
(Seowon and Gabi keep making mistakes.)

596
00:25:41,982 --> 00:25:44,591
(The formation is in disorder in the latter part of the break.)

597
00:25:44,591 --> 00:25:45,651
Oh, dear.

598
00:25:45,651 --> 00:25:47,252
Oh, no. It's okay.

599
00:25:54,532 --> 00:26:00,601
(They try to catch up with the pace.)

600
00:26:15,621 --> 00:26:18,351
- Thank you. - Thank you for the performance.

601
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:20,722
Team Garden.

602
00:26:21,151 --> 00:26:26,292
Some of you made mistakes, so it was a little disappointing.

603
00:26:26,391 --> 00:26:28,532
But what you did well is...

604
00:26:28,661 --> 00:26:32,032
that every one of you made eye contact with me...

605
00:26:32,032 --> 00:26:34,702
and smiled at me while dancing.

606
00:26:34,702 --> 00:26:38,071
It made me feel good.

607
00:26:38,071 --> 00:26:40,141
- Thank you. - Well done.

608
00:26:40,341 --> 00:26:41,442
The last team to go.

609
00:26:42,111 --> 00:26:43,442
Team Cruise.

610
00:26:43,712 --> 00:26:45,381
- Nana, you did well. - No.

611
00:26:45,581 --> 00:26:47,212
- I got it all wrong. - You did well.

612
00:26:47,212 --> 00:26:49,151
- I made mistakes as well. - I got it wrong.

613
00:26:50,321 --> 00:26:51,752
Gabi, it's okay. I also made mistakes.

614
00:26:52,121 --> 00:26:53,151
It's no problem.

615
00:26:54,052 --> 00:26:55,821
- You did well. - No.

616
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:00,331
I don't think I did well.

617
00:27:00,462 --> 00:27:01,901
I'm so sad.

618
00:27:02,732 --> 00:27:04,202
The last team to go.

619
00:27:04,202 --> 00:27:05,331
(The last team of the evaluation)

620
00:27:05,331 --> 00:27:06,502
Team Cruise.

621
00:27:06,502 --> 00:27:08,641
(Team Cruise)

622
00:27:09,042 --> 00:27:11,071
It's Team Cruise.

623
00:27:11,071 --> 00:27:12,171
Good luck.

624
00:27:12,942 --> 00:27:15,482
All right. The last one to go is Team Cruise.

625
00:27:15,942 --> 00:27:17,081
Do you want to come with me...

626
00:27:17,081 --> 00:27:20,182
- to "The Entertainment Awards?" - To "The Entertainment Awards?"

627
00:27:20,611 --> 00:27:21,722
- Hello. - Hello.

628
00:27:21,722 --> 00:27:23,651
- We're Team Cruise. - We're Team Cruise.

629
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:25,591
(We are... Team.)

630
00:27:26,522 --> 00:27:27,921
(We are... Cruise.)

631
00:27:29,321 --> 00:27:31,561
(What did Team Cruise prepare for their performance?)

632
00:27:31,891 --> 00:27:34,661
Let's think of the formation first...

633
00:27:34,661 --> 00:27:35,661
- Good. - before we move.

634
00:27:35,661 --> 00:27:39,401
Let's keep it simple before the dance break.

635
00:27:39,401 --> 00:27:41,841
Point twice and hit.

636
00:27:42,071 --> 00:27:43,671
It has to look cool.

637
00:27:43,671 --> 00:27:45,311
We do the pretty things in the first half.

638
00:27:45,311 --> 00:27:47,141
Is it called a pair dance?

639
00:27:47,141 --> 00:27:48,881
I want us to dance in pairs.

640
00:27:49,242 --> 00:27:51,351
- I see. - We have ten members.

641
00:27:51,351 --> 00:27:55,052
I'm pretty confident with the freestyle part.

642
00:27:55,821 --> 00:27:57,222
- I mean... - It should go like this.

643
00:27:57,222 --> 00:27:59,921
We should walk out like Sujin.

644
00:28:00,752 --> 00:28:02,821
(Things are going well with the good choreographers.)

645
00:28:02,821 --> 00:28:04,361
Hang on. Let's sort things out.

646
00:28:04,361 --> 00:28:06,692
- I think it will look pretty. - I love this.

647
00:28:06,692 --> 00:28:09,131
- I wanted something like this. - I'll do this.

648
00:28:09,131 --> 00:28:12,571
I worked hard so I could stand out a little more.

649
00:28:12,571 --> 00:28:14,302
I want to enjoy it...

650
00:28:14,302 --> 00:28:16,171
as if I'm performing at an awards ceremony for real.

651
00:28:16,472 --> 00:28:18,371
(They work on the details.)

652
00:28:18,712 --> 00:28:20,671
(Glancing)

653
00:28:20,671 --> 00:28:22,111
You forgot the moves, right?

654
00:28:23,341 --> 00:28:25,381
We're supposed to spread our fingers apart here.

655
00:28:25,682 --> 00:28:26,911
(Like this?)

656
00:28:26,911 --> 00:28:27,911
No.

657
00:28:27,911 --> 00:28:29,252
Clench your fists, and then spread them apart.

658
00:28:29,881 --> 00:28:32,052
- As you go forward. - Like this.

659
00:28:32,591 --> 00:28:34,651
Sua had a hard time learning the moves.

660
00:28:34,651 --> 00:28:37,091
So Sieun and I worked together...

661
00:28:37,091 --> 00:28:38,891
to teach her the details of the first verse.

662
00:28:39,331 --> 00:28:42,202
We should do it with restrained moves.

663
00:28:42,702 --> 00:28:44,401
- Pelvis. - Pelvis.

664
00:28:44,401 --> 00:28:45,601
(They keep working on the details.)

665
00:28:45,601 --> 00:28:46,802
- Middle. - Middle.

666
00:28:47,331 --> 00:28:48,371
- Up. - Up.

667
00:28:48,742 --> 00:28:49,772
Yes.

668
00:28:49,901 --> 00:28:51,341
Pelvis, middle, up.

669
00:28:51,671 --> 00:28:53,571
(She suddenly takes out her phone.)

670
00:28:53,571 --> 00:28:54,611
Okay.

671
00:28:55,712 --> 00:28:59,381
I've never choreographed a dance before.

672
00:28:59,611 --> 00:29:04,651
I felt bad that I couldn't help the team.

673
00:29:05,192 --> 00:29:07,391
I want to show you this.

674
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:12,792
Ta-da.

675
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:14,861
These are the details we worked on.

676
00:29:14,861 --> 00:29:16,032
(The checklist of the choreography that Yoona's been working on.)

677
00:29:16,032 --> 00:29:17,502
I want...

678
00:29:18,061 --> 00:29:21,371
to prove myself with a quality performance.

679
00:29:22,042 --> 00:29:23,571
I'm very confident.

680
00:29:24,141 --> 00:29:25,671
We don't have much time.

681
00:29:25,671 --> 00:29:27,641
- We will do it as we learn. - Okay.

682
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:28,982
Watch this, guys.

683
00:29:30,341 --> 00:29:33,881
(They get together again and practice as a team.)

684
00:29:34,552 --> 00:29:38,081
(They learn the moves for the freestyle part one by one.)

685
00:29:38,081 --> 00:29:39,321
- This is it, right? - Yes.

686
00:29:39,522 --> 00:29:40,851
(They check the details thoroughly.)

687
00:29:40,851 --> 00:29:41,962
It's here.

688
00:29:42,522 --> 00:29:48,802
(Team Cruise gets things done quickly.)

689
00:29:49,732 --> 00:29:51,161
You came up with a good one.

690
00:29:52,101 --> 00:29:54,272
- I think our dance is the best. - I know.

691
00:29:54,702 --> 00:29:56,641
We can do well as a team.

692
00:29:56,871 --> 00:29:59,442
And I'll also stand out as a solo.

693
00:29:59,841 --> 00:30:02,512
I really want to perform...

694
00:30:02,512 --> 00:30:04,742
at the Entertainment Awards.

695
00:30:05,851 --> 00:30:07,081
Don't be nervous. We can do this.

696
00:30:07,252 --> 00:30:08,722
- Let's do this. - Let's do it.

697
00:30:08,722 --> 00:30:09,851
We can do this.

698
00:30:09,851 --> 00:30:11,722
- Good luck. - Good luck.

699
00:30:14,921 --> 00:30:16,661
(Surprised)

700
00:30:18,861 --> 00:30:21,932
(Elisia catches people's eyes from the start.)

701
00:30:22,802 --> 00:30:23,901
I like her smile.

702
00:30:35,341 --> 00:30:38,851
(The freestyle part of Team Cruise)

703
00:30:38,851 --> 00:30:40,052
(Impressed)

704
00:30:43,921 --> 00:30:46,292
(The pair dance of Hyeonju and Yunha)

705
00:30:46,292 --> 00:30:47,851
(Amazed)

706
00:31:06,972 --> 00:31:08,042
The dance looks cool.

707
00:31:10,881 --> 00:31:12,381
(Team Cruise shows the perfect teamwork.)

708
00:31:12,381 --> 00:31:14,381
- Yes. - Yes.

709
00:31:28,962 --> 00:31:30,861
- Thank you. - Thank you.

710
00:31:33,032 --> 00:31:35,341
- Thank you. - I like their choreography best.

711
00:31:35,571 --> 00:31:37,202
Among the three teams,

712
00:31:37,202 --> 00:31:42,012
I think you showed the best choreography and teamwork.

713
00:31:42,012 --> 00:31:43,682
- Thank you. - I liked that.

714
00:31:43,982 --> 00:31:46,482
When the dance break started, Yunha and Hyeonju...

715
00:31:46,482 --> 00:31:50,381
I was impressed by the part where you two danced together.

716
00:31:50,381 --> 00:31:55,891
I think the dance showed your charms as individuals well.

717
00:31:55,891 --> 00:31:56,921
- Thank you. - Well done.

718
00:31:56,921 --> 00:31:58,121
Thank you.

719
00:32:00,932 --> 00:32:03,061
- Thank you. - It was really cool.

720
00:32:03,561 --> 00:32:07,432
(The mission performances are over.)

721
00:32:07,432 --> 00:32:09,702
I made too many mistakes.

722
00:32:10,401 --> 00:32:11,712
I'm so nervous.

723
00:32:11,712 --> 00:32:13,311
- I feel the same. - What do we do?

724
00:32:13,911 --> 00:32:18,042
You all did a great job in such a short period of time.

725
00:32:18,042 --> 00:32:19,411
I really appreciate it.

726
00:32:19,982 --> 00:32:23,022
But only eight of you will be able to perform...

727
00:32:23,022 --> 00:32:24,282
- on stage. - Only eight of us.

728
00:32:24,482 --> 00:32:28,292
- Only eight of you will perform. - My goodness.

729
00:32:28,492 --> 00:32:31,591
Let's start with Team Cruise.

730
00:32:31,591 --> 00:32:34,591
(The result of Team Cruise will be announced first.)

731
00:32:34,591 --> 00:32:35,601
- What? - My gosh.

732
00:32:37,932 --> 00:32:39,601
I hate this.

733
00:32:39,601 --> 00:32:40,732
Oh, no.

734
00:32:40,871 --> 00:32:44,171
(Who will get to perform at the Entertainment Awards?)

735
00:32:44,542 --> 00:32:46,311
Among Team Cruise,

736
00:32:46,871 --> 00:32:48,042
four will be picked.

737
00:32:48,042 --> 00:32:50,442
(4 members of Team Cruise)

738
00:32:50,442 --> 00:32:51,482
That's amazing!

739
00:32:51,611 --> 00:32:54,052
- Four is a lot. - We can call it a success already.

740
00:32:54,052 --> 00:32:55,621
I'm satisfied already.

741
00:32:56,222 --> 00:32:58,022
- It's half. - Right.

742
00:32:58,121 --> 00:32:59,821
- That's a lot. - It's half.

743
00:33:01,052 --> 00:33:02,121
First.

744
00:33:02,121 --> 00:33:05,792
(Who will be picked among Team Cruise?)

745
00:33:06,232 --> 00:33:08,432
First, Bang Yunha.

746
00:33:08,432 --> 00:33:11,901
(First, Bang Yunha)

747
00:33:11,901 --> 00:33:13,601
Thank you.

748
00:33:14,071 --> 00:33:17,502
Yunha showed neat dance moves.

749
00:33:18,071 --> 00:33:20,942
And I liked her detailed moves.

750
00:33:21,371 --> 00:33:22,482
Elisia.

751
00:33:22,482 --> 00:33:26,052
(Second, Elisia)

752
00:33:26,052 --> 00:33:28,012
- Elisia, why are you... - Elisia.

753
00:33:28,821 --> 00:33:30,952
I liked Elisia's face...

754
00:33:30,952 --> 00:33:33,252
during the intro.

755
00:33:34,821 --> 00:33:38,992
(Elisia's facial expression caught everyone's eyes.)

756
00:33:38,992 --> 00:33:40,292
Thank you.

757
00:33:41,161 --> 00:33:42,161
(Who's the third girl to be picked?)

758
00:33:42,161 --> 00:33:43,232
Hwang Sieun.

759
00:33:43,432 --> 00:33:44,831
(Third, Hwang Sieun)

760
00:33:44,831 --> 00:33:46,802
- Thank you. - And Oh Yoona.

761
00:33:46,802 --> 00:33:48,131
- These four. - Thank you.

762
00:33:48,702 --> 00:33:50,571
- Seriously? - It's amazing.

763
00:33:50,972 --> 00:33:53,071
Sieun and Yoona...

764
00:33:53,341 --> 00:33:57,182
did a good job showing their cheerful energy.

765
00:33:57,182 --> 00:33:59,381
That's why I picked them.

766
00:33:59,712 --> 00:34:01,851
- Thank you. - Thank you.

767
00:34:01,921 --> 00:34:03,982
Thank you. Thank you so much.

768
00:34:05,091 --> 00:34:06,492
- Well done. - Thank you.

769
00:34:06,552 --> 00:34:08,122
I worked hard.

770
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:12,032
I think she noticed my hard work,

771
00:34:12,032 --> 00:34:13,731
so I was glad.

772
00:34:14,231 --> 00:34:15,461
Team Aqua.

773
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:18,571
I'll pick three members from Team Aqua.

774
00:34:19,532 --> 00:34:21,602
Yes. I know that's a lot.

775
00:34:21,941 --> 00:34:22,941
My gosh.

776
00:34:23,302 --> 00:34:25,242
- Only one from them. - Yes. I know that's a lot.

777
00:34:25,242 --> 00:34:26,242
Unbelievable.

778
00:34:26,242 --> 00:34:27,412
(Only one will be picked from Team Garden.)

779
00:34:27,872 --> 00:34:32,682
(Who will be picked among Team Aqua?)

780
00:34:32,682 --> 00:34:34,151
First.

781
00:34:34,151 --> 00:34:36,222
Kim Sumin.

782
00:34:36,852 --> 00:34:38,321
Sumin.

783
00:34:38,321 --> 00:34:40,151
(Fifth, Kim Sumin)

784
00:34:40,151 --> 00:34:41,452
Sumin.

785
00:34:42,861 --> 00:34:45,461
Sumin is the best.

786
00:34:45,461 --> 00:34:46,832
Don't cry.

787
00:34:48,932 --> 00:34:50,001
Don't cry.

788
00:34:50,332 --> 00:34:53,332
Sumin also showed neat moves.

789
00:34:53,332 --> 00:34:55,401
She stood out in the team.

790
00:34:55,671 --> 00:34:56,802
Second.

791
00:34:56,802 --> 00:34:58,472
Narumi.

792
00:34:58,472 --> 00:35:02,642
(Sixth, Narumi)

793
00:35:03,611 --> 00:35:04,611
Congratulations.

794
00:35:06,611 --> 00:35:08,751
Third, Kotoko.

795
00:35:08,751 --> 00:35:12,251
(Seventh, Kotoko)

796
00:35:12,251 --> 00:35:13,452
What are you doing?

797
00:35:14,651 --> 00:35:15,892
Did you see her response?

798
00:35:15,892 --> 00:35:16,961
(She's cute.)

799
00:35:17,191 --> 00:35:19,461
I picked Narumi because she showed...

800
00:35:19,461 --> 00:35:21,562
pretty and refined dance moves.

801
00:35:21,691 --> 00:35:23,802
And I picked Kotoko because of this.

802
00:35:23,802 --> 00:35:25,131
This part.

803
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:27,571
(Cute)

804
00:35:29,671 --> 00:35:30,671
She was so cute.

805
00:35:30,671 --> 00:35:33,742
I think her image is perfect for "Want to Come With Me?"

806
00:35:33,742 --> 00:35:35,412
That's why I chose her.

807
00:35:36,412 --> 00:35:37,812
Congratulations.

808
00:35:39,582 --> 00:35:42,751
Next. The last one, Team Garden.

809
00:35:42,751 --> 00:35:44,622
(The result of Team Garden)

810
00:35:44,852 --> 00:35:46,591
Only one of us will be picked.

811
00:35:47,021 --> 00:35:49,892
I thought she'd pick a lot from Team Garden.

812
00:35:49,892 --> 00:35:52,492
Team Garden has Seowon and Nana.

813
00:35:52,492 --> 00:35:53,791
- And there's Gabi. - Gabi.

814
00:35:53,791 --> 00:35:55,432
- Team Garden. - And there's Sunwoo.

815
00:35:56,501 --> 00:35:58,231
I picked...

816
00:35:58,702 --> 00:36:03,001
only one member because you didn't dance in unison.

817
00:36:03,001 --> 00:36:05,812
The moves were in disorder.

818
00:36:05,812 --> 00:36:08,941
That made me pick only one member of this team.

819
00:36:09,381 --> 00:36:10,541
Who would it be?

820
00:36:10,541 --> 00:36:13,251
All right. Team Garden.

821
00:36:13,412 --> 00:36:15,682
- It's only one. I'm nervous. - It's only one.

822
00:36:16,122 --> 00:36:21,452
(Who will be the last one to join the performance?)

823
00:36:21,651 --> 00:36:24,722
Team Garden. It's Nana.

824
00:36:24,722 --> 00:36:27,432
(The last member is Nana.)

825
00:36:27,432 --> 00:36:28,492
Thank you.

826
00:36:28,802 --> 00:36:31,762
- Thank you. - Congratulations.

827
00:36:31,762 --> 00:36:32,832
Congratulations.

828
00:36:32,832 --> 00:36:34,032
(Disappointed)

829
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:35,501
Good for her.

830
00:36:36,001 --> 00:36:38,501
Nana showed pretty dance moves.

831
00:36:38,642 --> 00:36:40,711
I think she will have a lot to show...

832
00:36:40,841 --> 00:36:45,512
when she performs at the Entertainment Awards.

833
00:36:45,782 --> 00:36:47,552
So I picked Nana.

834
00:36:48,151 --> 00:36:50,952
(The 8 members to perform at the Entertainment Awards are decided.)

835
00:36:51,421 --> 00:36:55,861
It's my first time performing in front of famous people,

836
00:36:55,861 --> 00:36:57,461
so I'm really nervous.

837
00:36:57,662 --> 00:37:00,062
But I will make sure to pull it off well.

838
00:37:00,861 --> 00:37:03,662
Now that I've gained such a precious chance,

839
00:37:03,662 --> 00:37:06,032
I will give it my all.

840
00:37:06,401 --> 00:37:09,972
Representing the other 30 participants,

841
00:37:09,972 --> 00:37:11,671
I will put on an amazing stage...

842
00:37:11,671 --> 00:37:14,941
and kill it.

843
00:37:15,642 --> 00:37:17,582
(The 8 members' stage will be revealed at...)

844
00:37:17,582 --> 00:37:19,512
(the "SBS Entertainment Awards" on Saturday, December 30.)

845
00:37:20,012 --> 00:37:22,881
(And their fated day has come.)

846
00:37:23,682 --> 00:37:27,291
(The fated day the survivors and eliminated ones are decided)

847
00:37:27,291 --> 00:37:29,562
(The 1st Promotion Ceremony)

848
00:37:29,562 --> 00:37:32,291
- "The 1st Promotion Ceremony!" - It's the 1st Promotion Ceremony.

849
00:37:32,532 --> 00:37:33,762
- Please. - I'm excited.

850
00:37:33,762 --> 00:37:35,191
I'm scared.

851
00:37:35,191 --> 00:37:37,332
The debut gateway...

852
00:37:37,332 --> 00:37:39,231
in the global girl group production project...

853
00:37:39,231 --> 00:37:42,571
Universe Ticket, Road to PRISM, has five levels.

854
00:37:43,202 --> 00:37:45,412
Only the eight members in the highest level,

855
00:37:45,412 --> 00:37:47,611
PRISM, can make the debut.

856
00:37:48,372 --> 00:37:50,941
Through today's First Promotion Ceremony,

857
00:37:51,182 --> 00:37:55,151
you will be able to check your current level out of the five.

858
00:37:56,452 --> 00:37:57,521
Please.

859
00:37:57,521 --> 00:37:59,492
The nine promoted through Unicorn Ticketing...

860
00:37:59,492 --> 00:38:01,452
in the last Level Station...

861
00:38:02,091 --> 00:38:03,521
are in Level S.

862
00:38:03,521 --> 00:38:04,821
(Narumi did not attend due to health issues.)

863
00:38:04,821 --> 00:38:07,162
The remaining 21 members...

864
00:38:07,162 --> 00:38:09,131
are in Level M.

865
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:12,932
The members who fail to get promoted...

866
00:38:13,071 --> 00:38:15,771
and remain in Level M today...

867
00:38:16,102 --> 00:38:18,001
- will all be eliminated. - Oh, no.

868
00:38:18,541 --> 00:38:19,941
- Gosh. - We'll all get eliminated.

869
00:38:19,941 --> 00:38:22,012
What now? All at once?

870
00:38:22,312 --> 00:38:24,282
The First Promotion Ceremony's level score...

871
00:38:24,481 --> 00:38:26,012
is a total of Fan Ticketing points...

872
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:29,251
and the bonus points from the Unicorn Ticketing.

873
00:38:30,381 --> 00:38:33,091
From around 100 countries,

874
00:38:33,091 --> 00:38:37,321
a total of 5,180,464 votes were cast...

875
00:38:37,461 --> 00:38:40,432
through Fan Ticketing, cheering on the girls' dreams.

876
00:38:40,432 --> 00:38:42,662
- Gosh. - A total of 5.18 million?

877
00:38:42,802 --> 00:38:45,131
Who will take a step closer...

878
00:38:45,131 --> 00:38:47,932
to their dream debut?

879
00:38:47,932 --> 00:38:49,671
- Please. - And...

880
00:38:50,271 --> 00:38:54,912
how many will get eliminated and leave the Universe today?

881
00:38:56,242 --> 00:38:58,481
The First Promotion Ceremony of Universe Ticket,

882
00:38:58,481 --> 00:39:00,512
the girls' drama to make their dream debut,

883
00:39:01,552 --> 00:39:03,052
will start now.

884
00:39:03,052 --> 00:39:06,291
(The 1st Promotion Ceremony starts now.)

885
00:39:06,291 --> 00:39:07,352
I'm nervous.

886
00:39:07,992 --> 00:39:10,591
- I wish time would stop right now. - Please.

887
00:39:10,591 --> 00:39:13,262
Here are the first members to check their levels.

888
00:39:13,432 --> 00:39:15,562
- Right away? - Isn't this too sudden?

889
00:39:15,562 --> 00:39:17,202
- I don't want to be first. - Right now?

890
00:39:17,562 --> 00:39:18,662
Oh Yoona...

891
00:39:20,102 --> 00:39:21,872
and Kotoko, please come forth.

892
00:39:21,872 --> 00:39:23,242
(Yoona and Kotoko will check their levels.)

893
00:39:23,242 --> 00:39:25,912
- Kotoko. - Good luck.

894
00:39:25,912 --> 00:39:28,571
- I can't watch this. - Kotoko.

895
00:39:29,242 --> 00:39:31,282
- Kotoko. - They must be really nervous.

896
00:39:36,321 --> 00:39:37,622
- Good luck! - Good luck!

897
00:39:37,622 --> 00:39:38,821
- Good luck! - Good luck!

898
00:39:40,352 --> 00:39:42,921
- My heart is pounding so fast. - Oh, no.

899
00:39:42,921 --> 00:39:44,791
- Do they get eliminated right away? - Yes.

900
00:39:48,532 --> 00:39:51,532
Here are the levels of the two members.

901
00:39:52,071 --> 00:39:54,102
- This is bad. - I can't.

902
00:40:05,381 --> 00:40:07,751
- Is this how it's revealed? - I thought the level would pop out.

903
00:40:11,552 --> 00:40:13,892
- Don't go down. - Keep going up.

904
00:40:14,352 --> 00:40:15,492
They must be nervous.

905
00:40:15,591 --> 00:40:17,591
- Go up! - Go up!

906
00:40:19,562 --> 00:40:20,631
Did they make it?

907
00:40:22,802 --> 00:40:24,501
(Yoona and Kotoko are promoted to Level S.)

908
00:40:24,501 --> 00:40:27,231
- What a relief. - Congratulations!

909
00:40:28,001 --> 00:40:29,571
- What? - Congratulations!

910
00:40:29,571 --> 00:40:30,941
It keeps going up!

911
00:40:30,941 --> 00:40:34,071
Kotoko!

912
00:40:34,071 --> 00:40:35,541
Congratulations!

913
00:40:35,541 --> 00:40:37,211
(Will they go to Level I?)

914
00:40:38,041 --> 00:40:39,182
It's not over yet.

915
00:40:46,521 --> 00:40:48,622
(Rank 12, Oh Yoona, Total: 79,475.8 points)

916
00:40:48,622 --> 00:40:51,021
So we could keep advancing.

917
00:40:51,021 --> 00:40:52,162
(Rank 8, Kotoko, Total:112,835 points)

918
00:40:52,162 --> 00:40:54,091
Oh Yoona and Kotoko...

919
00:40:54,291 --> 00:40:57,361
have been promoted from Level M to Level S.

920
00:40:58,102 --> 00:40:59,401
- Thank you. - Ranking eighth,

921
00:40:59,401 --> 00:41:02,642
Kotoko has made it to the debut cut-off line.

922
00:41:02,642 --> 00:41:04,472
That's amazing!

923
00:41:04,841 --> 00:41:06,041
Please say a word.

924
00:41:06,041 --> 00:41:07,941
She ranked 8th in the 1st Promotion Ceremony?

925
00:41:10,812 --> 00:41:15,952
I was extremely nervous.

926
00:41:15,952 --> 00:41:17,082
But...

927
00:41:19,492 --> 00:41:25,532
being on this big stage...

928
00:41:29,731 --> 00:41:31,432
- Is she crying? - Kotoko.

929
00:41:31,762 --> 00:41:32,932
Don't cry.

930
00:41:33,602 --> 00:41:34,972
Don't cry.

931
00:41:36,541 --> 00:41:38,071
Many people...

932
00:41:39,642 --> 00:41:41,242
- It's okay. - Why are you crying?

933
00:41:41,441 --> 00:41:43,211
Don't cry.

934
00:41:43,211 --> 00:41:45,381
are cheering me on.

935
00:41:48,552 --> 00:41:52,651
I'll keep doing my best, so keep watching me.

936
00:41:53,751 --> 00:41:56,461
Don't cry!

937
00:41:56,622 --> 00:41:57,622
No.

938
00:41:58,461 --> 00:42:00,361
- Stop. - No.

939
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:05,401
- Congratulations! - You can do it! You did well!

940
00:42:06,302 --> 00:42:10,302
I'm grateful to be promoted...

941
00:42:10,302 --> 00:42:11,802
to Level S.

942
00:42:11,802 --> 00:42:14,711
Thank you very much...

943
00:42:14,711 --> 00:42:17,441
to those who have voted for me.

944
00:42:17,711 --> 00:42:19,082
Thank you.

945
00:42:20,082 --> 00:42:23,651
The two will continue their journey in the Universe.

946
00:42:24,082 --> 00:42:26,052
Take a seat in Level S.

947
00:42:26,052 --> 00:42:28,521
- Thank you. - Thank you.

948
00:42:28,521 --> 00:42:29,662
- Congratulations! - Congratulations!

949
00:42:30,162 --> 00:42:32,631
- Come on. - Come here.

950
00:42:32,631 --> 00:42:34,231
- Come on. - Level S.

951
00:42:34,231 --> 00:42:35,961
- Level S. - Come on.

952
00:42:36,162 --> 00:42:37,262
Congratulations!

953
00:42:37,401 --> 00:42:39,432
- Thank you. - Congratulations, Kotoko!

954
00:42:39,472 --> 00:42:41,401
- Congratulations! - Hey.

955
00:42:41,401 --> 00:42:43,972
- I love you. I love you so much. - Congratulations.

956
00:42:44,501 --> 00:42:45,972
- How do you feel? - Superstar.

957
00:42:46,211 --> 00:42:47,211
I love you.

958
00:42:47,972 --> 00:42:49,611
- I'm jealous. - They already got promoted...

959
00:42:49,611 --> 00:42:51,041
- to the level above. - Yes.

960
00:42:51,282 --> 00:42:53,012
- They went up right away. - We must...

961
00:42:53,012 --> 00:42:54,582
- We will get promoted. - go up a level.

962
00:42:55,251 --> 00:42:56,452
Who will it be next?

963
00:42:56,622 --> 00:42:58,751
Here are the next members to check their levels.

964
00:42:59,021 --> 00:43:00,921
Despite their young age, they are called...

965
00:43:00,921 --> 00:43:02,122
- the aces in Universe Ticket... - Seowon?

966
00:43:02,122 --> 00:43:03,892
- because of their excellent skills. - I told you it was us.

967
00:43:03,892 --> 00:43:04,921
Lim Seowon.

968
00:43:06,131 --> 00:43:07,131
Lee Eunchae.

969
00:43:07,131 --> 00:43:08,361
And Gabi.

970
00:43:08,361 --> 00:43:09,702
(Lim Seowon and Gabi will check their levels.)

971
00:43:10,062 --> 00:43:11,961
- Good luck, Gabi. - Good luck. You can do it.

972
00:43:11,961 --> 00:43:13,131
- You can do it. - Don't cry.

973
00:43:13,131 --> 00:43:14,271
Good luck!

974
00:43:15,771 --> 00:43:18,501
Gosh. They must be really nervous.

975
00:43:18,901 --> 00:43:20,711
After meeting as rivals in the Level Test,

976
00:43:20,711 --> 00:43:23,582
their fates changed when they were given...

977
00:43:23,582 --> 00:43:25,611
high and average, respectively.

978
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:28,582
How far will they be promoted...

979
00:43:28,852 --> 00:43:31,921
with just the Fan Ticketing after failing the Unicorn Ticketing?

980
00:43:32,492 --> 00:43:35,151
Here are the levels of the two members.

981
00:43:35,151 --> 00:43:36,521
(Revealing Lim Seowon and Gabi's levels)

982
00:43:36,521 --> 00:43:37,591
My heart is beating fast.

983
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:50,742
- It's going up. - Let's go.

984
00:43:51,372 --> 00:43:52,642
- Nice. - It's going up.

985
00:43:53,242 --> 00:43:54,541
- They're safe. - Okay.

986
00:43:54,812 --> 00:43:56,512
They made it.

987
00:43:57,841 --> 00:43:58,981
But how far?

988
00:43:59,381 --> 00:44:02,552
(Both have been promoted to Level S.)

989
00:44:02,552 --> 00:44:04,381
- Here it goes. - Let's go.

990
00:44:04,381 --> 00:44:05,691
- It's going up. - Up it goes.

991
00:44:05,691 --> 00:44:07,052
- It's going up fast. - Here it goes.

992
00:44:07,052 --> 00:44:09,722
- It's going up a lot. - No way.

993
00:44:11,162 --> 00:44:13,332
(Will they go beyond Level S and reach Level I?)

994
00:44:13,762 --> 00:44:15,802
- How far will it go? - My gosh.

995
00:44:16,961 --> 00:44:18,532
- Oh, my! - My gosh!

996
00:44:18,532 --> 00:44:19,932
(Gabi is promoted to Level S.)

997
00:44:23,401 --> 00:44:25,202
- Oh, my! - Seowon!

998
00:44:25,912 --> 00:44:27,211
Seowon is amazing!

999
00:44:27,312 --> 00:44:29,341
(Seowon is promoted to Level I.)

1000
00:44:29,341 --> 00:44:31,242
Seowon is crying. Oh, no.

1001
00:44:32,012 --> 00:44:33,282
- Don't cry. - Congratulations.

1002
00:44:33,282 --> 00:44:34,912
She advanced to two levels above.

1003
00:44:36,952 --> 00:44:39,992
(She got promoted to two levels above with just Fan Ticketing.)

1004
00:44:39,992 --> 00:44:42,122
Lim Seowon has been promoted to Level I,

1005
00:44:42,122 --> 00:44:45,122
and Gabi has been promoted to Level S.

1006
00:44:45,122 --> 00:44:47,461
Just how many votes did she get?

1007
00:44:49,631 --> 00:44:51,901
With Fan Ticketing, Lim Seowon...

1008
00:44:51,901 --> 00:44:54,001
got promoted to two levels above at once...

1009
00:44:54,001 --> 00:44:57,541
and became the first to rank Level I in Universe Ticket.

1010
00:44:57,841 --> 00:44:59,472
Congratulations, Seowon!

1011
00:45:02,041 --> 00:45:06,012
Thank you to all the fans who voted for me.

1012
00:45:06,251 --> 00:45:08,481
I will do my best from now on.

1013
00:45:09,481 --> 00:45:11,782
- Don't cry! - I'm about to cry.

1014
00:45:12,021 --> 00:45:13,921
- I'm tearing up. - I'm about to cry.

1015
00:45:13,921 --> 00:45:16,062
I'm grateful to all my fans.

1016
00:45:16,461 --> 00:45:20,091
I will work harder and show the best version of myself.

1017
00:45:20,091 --> 00:45:21,231
(Rank 6, Gabi, Total: 139,734.5 points)

1018
00:45:21,231 --> 00:45:22,562
Thank you.

1019
00:45:22,932 --> 00:45:24,062
Don't cry.

1020
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:36,912
Why is this making me sad?

1021
00:45:36,912 --> 00:45:40,312
However, Lim Seowon, who promoted to Level I,

1022
00:45:40,552 --> 00:45:42,852
has the chance to get promoted again.

1023
00:45:43,352 --> 00:45:46,591
We will continue after checking all of the members' levels.

1024
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:48,591
Seowon could go higher.

1025
00:45:49,421 --> 00:45:52,122
That means she'll be closer to making a debut.

1026
00:45:52,662 --> 00:45:54,361
She's alone in Level I.

1027
00:45:54,361 --> 00:45:55,432
How cool.

1028
00:45:55,432 --> 00:45:56,762
(Seowon takes a seat in Level I.)

1029
00:46:00,872 --> 00:46:05,242
We will check the Level Station's low-ranking members next.

1030
00:46:05,242 --> 00:46:06,412
Hold on.

1031
00:46:06,571 --> 00:46:07,571
Minari.

1032
00:46:07,872 --> 00:46:09,242
Please.

1033
00:46:10,412 --> 00:46:12,512
Kwon Eunhyung. Please come forth.

1034
00:46:12,512 --> 00:46:14,012
It's already my turn?

1035
00:46:14,651 --> 00:46:16,521
- The sooner, the better. - Good luck.

1036
00:46:16,521 --> 00:46:17,921
- It's okay. Get going. - Good luck!

1037
00:46:17,921 --> 00:46:19,852
- You can do it! - Good luck!

1038
00:46:19,852 --> 00:46:20,921
Let's get promoted.

1039
00:46:22,421 --> 00:46:23,821
She's even checking her mic.

1040
00:46:25,262 --> 00:46:27,191
If one of you is eliminated,

1041
00:46:27,361 --> 00:46:28,662
who do you think it will be?

1042
00:46:28,662 --> 00:46:31,832
You're being too mean.

1043
00:46:32,062 --> 00:46:33,202
Me.

1044
00:46:34,032 --> 00:46:35,901
- No way. - No.

1045
00:46:35,901 --> 00:46:37,742
What are you saying right now?

1046
00:46:37,972 --> 00:46:40,312
- It's me. - Both of us will get promoted.

1047
00:46:40,611 --> 00:46:41,611
You're right.

1048
00:46:41,611 --> 00:46:42,941
- Yes. - You're right.

1049
00:46:44,481 --> 00:46:45,812
Let's get promoted!

1050
00:46:45,952 --> 00:46:49,952
We will check Kwon Eunhyung's level first.

1051
00:46:50,251 --> 00:46:52,021
What? Why are we suddenly checking one at a time?

1052
00:46:52,021 --> 00:46:53,622
- Why is he changing it up now? - Why?

1053
00:46:53,622 --> 00:46:55,251
- Will one of them get eliminated? - What?

1054
00:46:57,821 --> 00:46:59,062
Please.

1055
00:46:59,562 --> 00:47:00,832
Please.

1056
00:47:04,501 --> 00:47:06,401
Why is it going up slowly now?

1057
00:47:10,341 --> 00:47:11,802
I'm safe!

1058
00:47:12,941 --> 00:47:14,071
I'm safe!

1059
00:47:14,071 --> 00:47:15,171
(Kwon Eunhyung gets promoted to Level S.)

1060
00:47:15,211 --> 00:47:17,242
- She's safe! - There it goes.

1061
00:47:18,742 --> 00:47:19,852
There it goes.

1062
00:47:24,722 --> 00:47:25,992
She got promoted to Level S.

1063
00:47:26,492 --> 00:47:27,622
Congratulations.

1064
00:47:27,622 --> 00:47:29,421
Seriously. Eunhyung is trying to be funny.

1065
00:47:29,992 --> 00:47:31,321
Congratulations.

1066
00:47:31,821 --> 00:47:32,992
You can do this too.

1067
00:47:33,062 --> 00:47:34,892
- Congratulations, Eunhyung. - Congratulations, Eunhyung.

1068
00:47:34,961 --> 00:47:37,731
One more participant in a low rank...

1069
00:47:37,731 --> 00:47:39,401
will check her level with Minari.

1070
00:47:39,401 --> 00:47:40,532
- Two in a row? - What?

1071
00:47:40,532 --> 00:47:43,341
If not for Unicorn Ticketing during the Battle Week,

1072
00:47:43,472 --> 00:47:46,142
she wouldn't have been able to enter the Universe.

1073
00:47:48,142 --> 00:47:51,242
Idota Yui. Please come up to the stage.

1074
00:47:51,242 --> 00:47:54,251
- Yui. Gosh. - Why is he calling her now?

1075
00:47:54,312 --> 00:47:55,582
Don't cry, Yui.

1076
00:47:55,651 --> 00:47:56,881
- You got this, Yui. - Gosh.

1077
00:47:58,122 --> 00:47:59,992
For these two participants to be promoted,

1078
00:48:00,091 --> 00:48:02,591
many of their fans need to vote for them.

1079
00:48:03,361 --> 00:48:05,262
Despite the low ranks and negative feedback they received,

1080
00:48:05,262 --> 00:48:07,131
they managed to survive until now.

1081
00:48:07,432 --> 00:48:09,432
Will they be able to be promoted as well?

1082
00:48:11,501 --> 00:48:12,972
We will check their levels...

1083
00:48:12,972 --> 00:48:14,472
- at the same time. - At the same time?

1084
00:48:14,472 --> 00:48:15,571
(The results will be revealed at the same time.)

1085
00:48:18,271 --> 00:48:19,642
This is so scary.

1086
00:48:20,872 --> 00:48:23,881
Oh, no.

1087
00:48:26,052 --> 00:48:27,412
You can do this. Come on.

1088
00:48:28,412 --> 00:48:30,722
Here it goes.

1089
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:37,992
(Minari and Idota Yui failed to be promoted to the next level.)

1090
00:48:43,461 --> 00:48:45,932
Minari and Idota Yui...

1091
00:48:46,231 --> 00:48:47,771
failed to be promoted.

1092
00:48:51,102 --> 00:48:55,041
As Minari and Idota Yui remain in Level M,

1093
00:48:55,671 --> 00:48:58,981
they will not be able to join the journey to the Universe.

1094
00:48:58,981 --> 00:49:00,412
(The scores for eliminated participants...)

1095
00:49:00,412 --> 00:49:01,812
(can be checked on the show's official website.)

1096
00:49:03,582 --> 00:49:04,921
Well,

1097
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:06,892
to be honest,

1098
00:49:08,492 --> 00:49:15,062
I did think that I might get eliminated today.

1099
00:49:15,731 --> 00:49:16,932
So...

1100
00:49:19,032 --> 00:49:20,271
So...

1101
00:49:23,071 --> 00:49:25,341
when I checked the result,

1102
00:49:27,771 --> 00:49:30,782
it didn't hit me as hard as I thought it would.

1103
00:49:31,211 --> 00:49:32,541
Good luck, everyone.

1104
00:49:33,111 --> 00:49:34,251
You can do this.

1105
00:49:35,711 --> 00:49:36,921
Thank you.

1106
00:49:41,691 --> 00:49:47,562
I will not give up pursuing my dream here.

1107
00:49:48,432 --> 00:49:54,972
I will seize another opportunity to perform on stage.

1108
00:49:55,271 --> 00:49:57,102
Thank you for everything.

1109
00:50:02,912 --> 00:50:04,412
I know you worked really hard.

1110
00:50:04,782 --> 00:50:06,082
You worked hard.

1111
00:50:09,552 --> 00:50:11,352
You were great, Minari.

1112
00:50:12,791 --> 00:50:15,421
This time, we will check the levels...

1113
00:50:15,492 --> 00:50:19,321
of the participants who successfully got promoted with Unicorn Ticketing.

1114
00:50:20,091 --> 00:50:21,562
During the Revenge Battle,

1115
00:50:21,562 --> 00:50:23,032
the competition between the two sisters,

1116
00:50:23,032 --> 00:50:24,432
- the Baes, garnered attention. - "Competition?"

1117
00:50:24,702 --> 00:50:26,972
- Bae Haram. Bae Yeram. - They're meeting again.

1118
00:50:26,972 --> 00:50:28,001
(Bae Haram and Bae Yeram will check their levels.)

1119
00:50:28,001 --> 00:50:30,941
I shouldn't laugh right after I cry.

1120
00:50:31,972 --> 00:50:33,512
Both of you should get promoted.

1121
00:50:33,512 --> 00:50:35,111
The only way for you guys is up.

1122
00:50:35,341 --> 00:50:36,512
Gosh.

1123
00:50:38,282 --> 00:50:40,251
They both advanced with Unicorn Ticketing...

1124
00:50:40,251 --> 00:50:42,211
at the Level Station.

1125
00:50:42,481 --> 00:50:44,182
But their fates here have been different.

1126
00:50:45,021 --> 00:50:48,452
The younger sister, Bae Yeram, won three battles in a row.

1127
00:50:48,691 --> 00:50:51,461
She advanced with Unicorn Ticketing two times in a row.

1128
00:50:52,461 --> 00:50:54,032
But the older sister, Bae Haram,

1129
00:50:54,162 --> 00:50:56,231
lost to her sister in the Revenge Battle.

1130
00:50:56,562 --> 00:50:58,001
During the Level Test,

1131
00:50:58,001 --> 00:50:59,432
unlike her sister who was placed in the high level,

1132
00:50:59,432 --> 00:51:02,401
she was placed in the average level. The result had been disappointing.

1133
00:51:03,642 --> 00:51:06,771
We will now check the levels of these two participants.

1134
00:51:08,242 --> 00:51:09,611
Yeram, we should get promoted together.

1135
00:51:09,611 --> 00:51:11,381
I really can't watch this.

1136
00:51:11,582 --> 00:51:13,711
I think both of them will get promoted again.

1137
00:51:15,111 --> 00:51:16,222
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1138
00:51:16,222 --> 00:51:17,881
- It keeps circling. - Let's go.

1139
00:51:18,481 --> 00:51:20,021
Gosh, Haram.

1140
00:51:20,791 --> 00:51:21,852
Haram.

1141
00:51:23,892 --> 00:51:25,262
Thank you.

1142
00:51:25,262 --> 00:51:26,861
(Rank 9, Bae Haram, Total: 104,466.9 points)

1143
00:51:26,861 --> 00:51:28,131
(Rank 13, Bae Yeram, Total: 65,824.6 points)

1144
00:51:28,131 --> 00:51:31,562
Bae Haram and Bae Yeram are both placed in Level S.

1145
00:51:32,062 --> 00:51:34,171
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1146
00:51:34,631 --> 00:51:35,872
- Give her a hug and come down. - You should...

1147
00:51:35,872 --> 00:51:37,872
You guys should try to get along well.

1148
00:51:38,341 --> 00:51:39,812
Give her a hug.

1149
00:51:40,812 --> 00:51:42,841
They are congratulating each other.

1150
00:51:42,841 --> 00:51:44,242
(The moment of indifference between two sisters)

1151
00:51:44,582 --> 00:51:45,742
- Let us continue. - Okay.

1152
00:51:45,742 --> 00:51:48,111
We will check the levels of the participants...

1153
00:51:48,111 --> 00:51:50,481
who successfully got promoted to Level S with Unicorn Ticketing.

1154
00:51:50,481 --> 00:51:51,751
(The levels of the participants in Level S will be revealed.)

1155
00:51:51,821 --> 00:51:52,852
Goo Gyoryeon.

1156
00:51:52,852 --> 00:51:54,852
(Goo Gyoryeon)

1157
00:51:54,852 --> 00:51:55,892
Let's go, Gyoryeon.

1158
00:51:55,892 --> 00:51:58,492
Gehlee Dangca. Come up to the stage.

1159
00:51:58,821 --> 00:51:59,992
Gehlee.

1160
00:52:00,332 --> 00:52:01,392
You got this.

1161
00:52:01,691 --> 00:52:03,162
- You got this. - Good luck.

1162
00:52:03,332 --> 00:52:05,702
- Gehlee will definitely advance. - Right.

1163
00:52:06,001 --> 00:52:08,631
- Gehlee is very popular too. - Yes. That's right.

1164
00:52:09,202 --> 00:52:13,041
- Gosh, check out her pose. - Oh, my. Look at her pose.

1165
00:52:13,041 --> 00:52:14,271
(Gehlee's signature standing pose)

1166
00:52:14,271 --> 00:52:15,441
What?

1167
00:52:18,012 --> 00:52:20,211
- How is that? - She's so funny. Seriously.

1168
00:52:20,211 --> 00:52:21,211
Gosh, I love her.

1169
00:52:21,852 --> 00:52:22,921
Gyoryeon. Gehlee.

1170
00:52:23,021 --> 00:52:25,251
Do you think you can get promoted to the next level one more time?

1171
00:52:27,021 --> 00:52:28,191
I'd love to.

1172
00:52:28,191 --> 00:52:29,892
(I'd love to.)

1173
00:52:29,992 --> 00:52:31,821
"I'd love to."

1174
00:52:31,821 --> 00:52:35,091
We will now check the levels of Goo Gyoryeon and Gehlee Dangca.

1175
00:52:35,091 --> 00:52:37,532
(What will their levels be?)

1176
00:52:37,532 --> 00:52:38,662
Let's go.

1177
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:41,532
Good luck.

1178
00:52:41,532 --> 00:52:42,941
- Here it goes. - Keep going.

1179
00:52:46,041 --> 00:52:49,512
(Rank 17, Goo Gyoryeon, Total: 58,040 points)

1180
00:52:51,242 --> 00:52:52,682
(The meter keeps going for Gehlee Dangca.)

1181
00:52:52,682 --> 00:52:54,412
- Gosh. Gehlee Dangca. - Gehlee.

1182
00:52:55,952 --> 00:52:57,782
- Gehlee. - Will she get promoted again?

1183
00:52:57,952 --> 00:52:59,992
(Will she be the second participant to get promoted to Level I?)

1184
00:52:59,992 --> 00:53:01,122
- Gehlee. - Let's go.

1185
00:53:01,122 --> 00:53:02,791
- Let's go! - Gehlee.

1186
00:53:05,691 --> 00:53:07,191
- Yes. - Congratulations.

1187
00:53:07,992 --> 00:53:09,332
Gehlee Dangca.

1188
00:53:09,702 --> 00:53:12,662
You are the second participant to be promoted to Level I.

1189
00:53:14,001 --> 00:53:16,372
I think I'll be able to sleep really well tonight.

1190
00:53:17,202 --> 00:53:18,202
I'm so...

1191
00:53:21,611 --> 00:53:23,142
Thank you so much.

1192
00:53:26,282 --> 00:53:28,151
Thank you.

1193
00:53:31,151 --> 00:53:32,622
Congratulations.

1194
00:53:36,262 --> 00:53:38,162
- I want to go there. - Me too.

1195
00:53:38,162 --> 00:53:39,992
- Let's go. - The yellow level.

1196
00:53:40,662 --> 00:53:43,832
Fan Ticketing has decided the fates of the participants...

1197
00:53:43,832 --> 00:53:46,001
at the First Promotion Ceremony.

1198
00:53:46,372 --> 00:53:48,702
We will continue and check the levels.

1199
00:53:49,372 --> 00:53:51,771
These participants haven't received Unicorn Ticketing...

1200
00:53:51,771 --> 00:53:53,771
and are at a crossroads between promotion and elimination.

1201
00:53:53,912 --> 00:53:54,912
Oh, please.

1202
00:53:54,912 --> 00:53:58,381
These two participants go by as the top-tier charismatic performers.

1203
00:53:58,412 --> 00:53:59,512
"Charismatic?"

1204
00:53:59,582 --> 00:54:00,682
Jayla.

1205
00:54:01,981 --> 00:54:03,222
Kim Sumin.

1206
00:54:04,521 --> 00:54:07,021
- Don't forget your charisma. - Oh, no. Wait!

1207
00:54:07,021 --> 00:54:08,091
Don't forget your charisma.

1208
00:54:08,191 --> 00:54:09,421
You got this.

1209
00:54:09,961 --> 00:54:11,262
Oh, my.

1210
00:54:11,421 --> 00:54:12,892
Don't be nervous.

1211
00:54:14,932 --> 00:54:16,262
Kim Sumin...

1212
00:54:16,702 --> 00:54:18,262
performed well as a main vocalist...

1213
00:54:18,262 --> 00:54:19,802
of the team in the average level, Team "Superstar."

1214
00:54:20,102 --> 00:54:21,602
But she lost to Jayla,

1215
00:54:21,602 --> 00:54:23,102
the participant standing right next to her.

1216
00:54:23,171 --> 00:54:24,602
She had a taste of defeat for the first time.

1217
00:54:25,171 --> 00:54:28,171
Both of the participants are currently in Level M.

1218
00:54:28,441 --> 00:54:29,941
If they don't get promoted today,

1219
00:54:29,941 --> 00:54:32,812
their elimination will be confirmed here today.

1220
00:54:33,711 --> 00:54:36,481
Will they be able to get promoted together?

1221
00:54:37,251 --> 00:54:40,821
We will check the levels of Jayla and Kim Sumin.

1222
00:54:41,222 --> 00:54:42,421
- I'm nervous. - Gosh. Right.

1223
00:54:42,622 --> 00:54:44,222
- Why am I so nervous? - Please.

1224
00:54:45,521 --> 00:54:47,062
- Good luck. - Let's go.

1225
00:54:47,392 --> 00:54:49,162
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1226
00:54:49,162 --> 00:54:52,361
- Go straight up. - Let's get promoted. Please.

1227
00:54:52,832 --> 00:54:55,102
- Keep going. - Gosh.

1228
00:54:55,332 --> 00:54:56,571
- Go. - Go.

1229
00:54:56,571 --> 00:54:58,041
- It's going. - Go.

1230
00:54:58,142 --> 00:54:59,242
Keep going.

1231
00:54:59,571 --> 00:55:01,142
Keep going.

1232
00:55:01,142 --> 00:55:02,441
Go.

1233
00:55:04,312 --> 00:55:05,441
Don't stop.

1234
00:55:05,812 --> 00:55:07,052
Let's go.

1235
00:55:07,481 --> 00:55:09,881
- Go. - It's going.

1236
00:55:09,881 --> 00:55:11,151
Go.

1237
00:55:11,151 --> 00:55:13,091
- They did it. - They got promoted.

1238
00:55:13,952 --> 00:55:15,651
(Jayla and Kim Sumin are promoted to Level S.)

1239
00:55:15,651 --> 00:55:17,892
- Both Jayla and Kim Sumin... - Congratulations.

1240
00:55:17,892 --> 00:55:19,162
- are promoted to Level S. - Congratulations.

1241
00:55:19,162 --> 00:55:20,461
- Thank you. - Congratulations.

1242
00:55:20,461 --> 00:55:21,762
As for Kim Sumin,

1243
00:55:21,892 --> 00:55:24,131
we can check if she can be promoted one more time.

1244
00:55:24,202 --> 00:55:25,901
- Please wait. - There must be more.

1245
00:55:26,162 --> 00:55:27,202
Okay.

1246
00:55:27,202 --> 00:55:30,802
Here's the next participant who will check her level with Sumin.

1247
00:55:32,742 --> 00:55:34,771
- Is it me? - It's Kim Sujin.

1248
00:55:34,771 --> 00:55:37,282
(Kim Sujin will check her level.)

1249
00:55:37,282 --> 00:55:38,481
You'll be okay.

1250
00:55:39,881 --> 00:55:40,981
You got this.

1251
00:55:45,521 --> 00:55:48,052
- Kim Sujin and Kim Sumin... - Yes.

1252
00:55:48,222 --> 00:55:50,662
led Team Charismatic Winners for the Revenge Battle together...

1253
00:55:50,662 --> 00:55:52,461
and showed a great performance.

1254
00:55:53,461 --> 00:55:55,461
To perfect their performance,

1255
00:55:55,461 --> 00:55:57,461
they ended up having a power struggle...

1256
00:55:57,461 --> 00:55:59,332
which made the fans nervous.

1257
00:56:00,832 --> 00:56:03,142
These two participants never yield and are fiercely competitive...

1258
00:56:03,142 --> 00:56:05,401
when it comes to performing and winning.

1259
00:56:05,501 --> 00:56:09,611
Will one of them be promoted to Level I?

1260
00:56:10,682 --> 00:56:12,412
Kim Sujin verus Kim Sumin.

1261
00:56:13,052 --> 00:56:14,812
Kim Sumin versus Kim Sujin.

1262
00:56:14,812 --> 00:56:17,452
(Kim Sujin versus Kim Sumin)

1263
00:56:17,452 --> 00:56:19,021
How did we end up in a rivalry?

1264
00:56:19,182 --> 00:56:20,622
Right. Their rivalry is legendary.

1265
00:56:20,751 --> 00:56:24,421
We will now check the final levels of the two participants.

1266
00:56:24,421 --> 00:56:25,961
(The two participants will check their final levels.)

1267
00:56:29,392 --> 00:56:30,501
I'm so nervous.

1268
00:56:30,501 --> 00:56:31,602
- Gosh. - Let's go.

1269
00:56:35,731 --> 00:56:38,642
- Sujin and Sumin will remain... - Yes.

1270
00:56:38,702 --> 00:56:40,372
in Level S for the First Promotion Ceremony.

1271
00:56:41,711 --> 00:56:43,041
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

1272
00:56:43,041 --> 00:56:44,682
(Rank 18, Kim Sumin, Total: 57,811.1 points)

1273
00:56:45,041 --> 00:56:48,352
If it weren't for Unicorn Ticketing, Sujin would have been...

1274
00:56:48,881 --> 00:56:51,052
one of the participants who would have gotten eliminated...

1275
00:56:51,052 --> 00:56:53,392
for not having enough points at the cut-off point.

1276
00:57:00,932 --> 00:57:03,131
- I'm not nervous anymore at last. - The First Promotion Ceremony.

1277
00:57:03,432 --> 00:57:05,001
These 2 participants who were born in 2009...

1278
00:57:05,001 --> 00:57:06,571
dream of becoming all-rounders.

1279
00:57:06,932 --> 00:57:08,872
Let's check the levels of these two participants.

1280
00:57:08,872 --> 00:57:09,872
- Sieun? - Elisia.

1281
00:57:09,872 --> 00:57:11,302
- Elisia. - Elisia.

1282
00:57:11,302 --> 00:57:12,602
- Elisia. - Elisia.

1283
00:57:12,872 --> 00:57:13,912
Hello.

1284
00:57:14,771 --> 00:57:16,012
- Bang Yunha. - Yes.

1285
00:57:16,341 --> 00:57:17,441
I knew it.

1286
00:57:17,441 --> 00:57:18,941
(Elisia and Bang Yunha will check their levels.)

1287
00:57:19,142 --> 00:57:20,711
- Good luck. - Get promoted to Level I.

1288
00:57:25,481 --> 00:57:28,591
Both of them were placed in the high level.

1289
00:57:28,992 --> 00:57:31,361
They competed against each other with their new songs.

1290
00:57:31,961 --> 00:57:33,892
Bang Yunha won the battle.

1291
00:57:34,091 --> 00:57:36,461
Her team defeated Elisia's team.

1292
00:57:37,131 --> 00:57:38,202
As a result,

1293
00:57:38,361 --> 00:57:41,102
Yunha safely landed in Level S...

1294
00:57:41,102 --> 00:57:42,532
with Unicorn Ticketing.

1295
00:57:43,171 --> 00:57:44,302
One of the two participants...

1296
00:57:46,271 --> 00:57:47,742
will be promoted...

1297
00:57:48,872 --> 00:57:50,012
- Level I. - Gosh.

1298
00:57:50,441 --> 00:57:52,512
- One of them? - I wonder who it is.

1299
00:57:53,711 --> 00:57:55,582
How did the fates of these high-ranked girls...

1300
00:57:55,582 --> 00:57:57,452
who were born in the same year change?

1301
00:57:58,481 --> 00:58:00,791
Let's check the levels of the two participants.

1302
00:58:00,952 --> 00:58:02,622
- I'm nervous. - Really? Just one of them?

1303
00:58:03,821 --> 00:58:05,062
I think it might be Yunha.

1304
00:58:05,321 --> 00:58:07,191
Right. She's already in Level S.

1305
00:58:08,791 --> 00:58:10,062
I think it will be Elisia.

1306
00:58:12,901 --> 00:58:13,972
Let's go.

1307
00:58:17,401 --> 00:58:18,501
Let's go.

1308
00:58:30,751 --> 00:58:31,881
- Is it Yunha? - Gosh, Yunha.

1309
00:58:32,852 --> 00:58:33,921
- Yunha. - Yunha.

1310
00:58:34,852 --> 00:58:35,852
Gosh.

1311
00:58:37,122 --> 00:58:38,361
She was so close.

1312
00:58:38,861 --> 00:58:40,532
- Yunha was really close. - What a bummer.

1313
00:58:41,062 --> 00:58:42,492
- What a bummer. - What?

1314
00:58:42,492 --> 00:58:43,961
- Gosh, is it Elisia? - She's the one in Level I.

1315
00:58:44,901 --> 00:58:45,901
Elisia.

1316
00:58:46,702 --> 00:58:47,832
Gosh, Elisia.

1317
00:58:48,472 --> 00:58:49,501
Let's go.

1318
00:58:50,341 --> 00:58:53,041
- Elisia. - Elisia.

1319
00:58:53,041 --> 00:58:54,242
(Elisia's meter keeps heading toward Level I.)

1320
00:58:54,242 --> 00:58:56,211
Elisia!

1321
00:58:56,881 --> 00:58:58,981
- Elisia. - That's crazy.

1322
00:58:58,981 --> 00:59:00,582
(Elisia's final level is I.)

1323
00:59:00,582 --> 00:59:02,552
- She's crying. - Don't cry.

1324
00:59:03,751 --> 00:59:04,881
Don't cry.

1325
00:59:06,591 --> 00:59:08,552
Don't cry. Why are you crying?

1326
00:59:08,791 --> 00:59:10,892
You should be happy. You should celebrate.

1327
00:59:10,892 --> 00:59:12,892
You don't need to cry. No.

1328
00:59:13,392 --> 00:59:14,392
No.

1329
00:59:15,361 --> 00:59:16,392
It's okay.

1330
00:59:16,392 --> 00:59:18,131
I wanted to advance with you.

1331
00:59:18,131 --> 00:59:20,702
We will. I will be there too.

1332
00:59:21,202 --> 00:59:22,432
Elisia.

1333
00:59:23,102 --> 00:59:26,341
You managed to be promoted two levels from Level M to Level I.

1334
00:59:27,211 --> 00:59:30,211
Elisia was promoted to Level I from Level M...

1335
00:59:30,582 --> 00:59:33,852
solely based on the votes from her fans.

1336
00:59:34,052 --> 00:59:35,812
She became another participant joining Level I.

1337
00:59:35,952 --> 00:59:37,321
Tell us how you feel.

1338
00:59:37,981 --> 00:59:39,481
Actually, I also...

1339
00:59:42,651 --> 00:59:45,091
I didn't know what to expect...

1340
00:59:45,091 --> 00:59:46,162
because...

1341
00:59:47,262 --> 00:59:50,762
I thought Yunha and I both did...

1342
00:59:50,762 --> 00:59:52,762
(I thought Yunha and I both did well.)

1343
00:59:52,762 --> 00:59:54,271
It's okay.

1344
00:59:54,602 --> 00:59:56,472
I thought we were both doing really great.

1345
00:59:57,901 --> 01:00:01,211
I think we both deserve to go...

1346
01:00:02,271 --> 01:00:06,142
to Level I. And I really didn't know what to expect.

1347
01:00:07,552 --> 01:00:09,782
And I just...

1348
01:00:10,952 --> 01:00:14,622
I just want to thank everyone that voted for me.

1349
01:00:14,791 --> 01:00:16,762
Thank you so much.

1350
01:00:16,762 --> 01:00:18,961
(Thank you so much.)

1351
01:00:21,131 --> 01:00:22,361
Yunha.

1352
01:00:22,861 --> 01:00:24,062
- Yes. - You're ranked fifth currently.

1353
01:00:24,062 --> 01:00:25,932
- You're a step closer to debuting. - Gosh.

1354
01:00:25,932 --> 01:00:29,571
But you weren't able to get promoted to Level I from Level S.

1355
01:00:30,171 --> 01:00:33,341
You only have two percent remaining until Level I.

1356
01:00:33,972 --> 01:00:35,171
How do you feel after checking the result?

1357
01:00:36,682 --> 01:00:39,981
Actually, I'm sad to find out I'm only two percent short.

1358
01:00:40,282 --> 01:00:44,082
But I won't stop trying here. I'll keep going.

1359
01:00:44,622 --> 01:00:45,651
Go!

1360
01:00:48,791 --> 01:00:50,591
Don't cry. Oh, no.

1361
01:00:50,861 --> 01:00:52,562
(The girls are a step closer to their dreams.)

1362
01:00:52,562 --> 01:00:54,032
Was it tough?

1363
01:00:54,332 --> 01:00:58,932
So far, 16 out of 30 participants checked their levels.

1364
01:00:59,202 --> 01:01:00,202
That's a lot of people.

1365
01:01:00,202 --> 01:01:01,972
Currently, three participants are in Level I.

1366
01:01:02,501 --> 01:01:04,441
There are 13 participants in Level S.

1367
01:01:04,642 --> 01:01:07,341
The total number of each level continues to change.

1368
01:01:07,941 --> 01:01:11,282
These girls are the anchors of the participants...

1369
01:01:11,282 --> 01:01:13,211
and have taken the roles of the reliable leaders.

1370
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:15,412
They are the older members of Universe Ticket.

1371
01:01:17,352 --> 01:01:18,421
Lee Sunwoo.

1372
01:01:18,852 --> 01:01:20,421
- Oh, my. - Jin Hyeonju.

1373
01:01:21,151 --> 01:01:22,521
- Let's go. - Come up to the stage.

1374
01:01:22,952 --> 01:01:24,622
- Good luck. - You got this.

1375
01:01:24,622 --> 01:01:25,791
- Good luck. - Good luck.

1376
01:01:25,791 --> 01:01:27,162
- Hyeonju. - Make sure to get promoted.

1377
01:01:27,162 --> 01:01:28,662
- Good luck to us. - This isn't easy.

1378
01:01:29,332 --> 01:01:30,361
It's not.

1379
01:01:30,361 --> 01:01:31,562
Don't come back to Level M.

1380
01:01:32,802 --> 01:01:34,231
Don't be nervous, guys.

1381
01:01:40,142 --> 01:01:42,571
These two participants led their teams...

1382
01:01:42,571 --> 01:01:44,541
with great leadership skills for every mission.

1383
01:01:45,611 --> 01:01:48,651
However, these two leaders faced different results.

1384
01:01:49,782 --> 01:01:52,251
Lee Sunwoo won three battles in a row.

1385
01:01:52,921 --> 01:01:54,251
But Jin Hyeonju...

1386
01:01:54,251 --> 01:01:56,651
lost three battles in a row, which was a disappointing result.

1387
01:01:56,651 --> 01:01:57,861
(Lee Sunwoo won 3 battles, and Jin Hyeonju lost 3 battles.)

1388
01:01:58,091 --> 01:01:59,662
Lee Sunwoo won three battles in a row.

1389
01:02:00,392 --> 01:02:02,162
Jin Hyeonju lost three battles in a row.

1390
01:02:03,091 --> 01:02:06,932
Which one of them will be promoted to the next level?

1391
01:02:08,401 --> 01:02:11,401
We will now check Lee Sunwoo's level first.

1392
01:02:11,401 --> 01:02:13,271
- We'll check her level first? - Why are we doing it separately?

1393
01:02:16,341 --> 01:02:17,841
(What's Lee Sunwoo's level?)

1394
01:02:17,841 --> 01:02:18,841
Please.

1395
01:02:19,742 --> 01:02:20,881
Let's go.

1396
01:02:20,881 --> 01:02:22,452
- Please, Sunwoo. - Go.

1397
01:02:22,452 --> 01:02:23,552
- Go straight up. - Here it goes.

1398
01:02:33,021 --> 01:02:34,332
- Okay. - She did it.

1399
01:02:36,492 --> 01:02:37,802
Gosh. My heart.

1400
01:02:38,602 --> 01:02:39,762
- Gosh. - No way!

1401
01:02:40,571 --> 01:02:41,832
What? Seriously?

1402
01:02:44,071 --> 01:02:45,602
- Seriously? - Let's go.

1403
01:02:45,602 --> 01:02:46,671
- What? - Gosh.

1404
01:02:48,412 --> 01:02:49,472
She went up a lot, though.

1405
01:02:49,472 --> 01:02:51,381
- What? That's amazing. - Great.

1406
01:02:51,381 --> 01:02:52,881
(Lee Sunwoo is in Level S.)

1407
01:02:53,041 --> 01:02:55,452
Lee Sunwoo is currently ranked seventh...

1408
01:02:55,452 --> 01:02:57,751
- and got promoted to Level S. - She's ranked seventh.

1409
01:02:58,282 --> 01:02:59,821
Tell us how it feels to be promoted.

1410
01:02:59,821 --> 01:03:02,751
(Rank 7, Lee Sunwoo, Total: 113,915 points)

1411
01:03:04,321 --> 01:03:08,332
I would like to express my gratitude to the people...

1412
01:03:08,932 --> 01:03:12,262
who watched my journey so far, cheered me on, and voted for me,

1413
01:03:12,262 --> 01:03:14,472
so I could be promoted like this.

1414
01:03:14,872 --> 01:03:17,071
I will continue to do my best to show you good performances.

1415
01:03:17,071 --> 01:03:18,071
Thank you.

1416
01:03:18,341 --> 01:03:19,372
She was close, though.

1417
01:03:22,571 --> 01:03:25,012
I will now name the next participant who will check her level...

1418
01:03:25,012 --> 01:03:26,852
with Jin Hyeonju.

1419
01:03:27,782 --> 01:03:29,182
Jin Hyeonju and this participant...

1420
01:03:29,182 --> 01:03:31,722
performed together as Team "WHATEVA."

1421
01:03:32,182 --> 01:03:33,421
- It must be Huran. - Eunchae?

1422
01:03:33,651 --> 01:03:36,021
- Lee Eunchae. Come to the stage. - Gosh.

1423
01:03:36,021 --> 01:03:37,762
- Eunchae. - You got this.

1424
01:03:37,921 --> 01:03:38,921
- Okay. - Good luck.

1425
01:03:38,921 --> 01:03:39,961
Team "WHATEVA."

1426
01:03:39,961 --> 01:03:41,631
- Eunchae. - Team "WHATEVA."

1427
01:03:47,972 --> 01:03:50,841
Eunchae is the youngest participant, yet very talented.

1428
01:03:51,202 --> 01:03:52,602
With her fighting spirit and passion,

1429
01:03:52,602 --> 01:03:55,541
she showed an improved side of her for every mission.

1430
01:03:56,171 --> 01:03:58,182
Will her effort bear fruit today...

1431
01:03:58,812 --> 01:04:00,651
and help her get promoted?

1432
01:04:00,651 --> 01:04:02,651
(Will her effort bear fruit today and help her get promoted?)

1433
01:04:02,651 --> 01:04:03,852
Jin Hyeonju.

1434
01:04:04,921 --> 01:04:06,282
Before we check your level,

1435
01:04:07,021 --> 01:04:09,392
if you could say something to Eunchae,

1436
01:04:09,392 --> 01:04:10,722
what would you like to say?

1437
01:04:12,091 --> 01:04:13,321
This is so sad.

1438
01:04:14,231 --> 01:04:15,461
Don't cry.

1439
01:04:15,461 --> 01:04:17,262
- No. She can't get eliminated. - Please.

1440
01:04:18,401 --> 01:04:19,432
First of all,

1441
01:04:20,302 --> 01:04:23,432
I love her dearly.

1442
01:04:25,972 --> 01:04:28,771
Even if I don't get promoted here,

1443
01:04:29,341 --> 01:04:33,211
I would like to meet her again as performers on another stage.

1444
01:04:36,582 --> 01:04:37,622
This is tough.

1445
01:04:38,352 --> 01:04:40,791
We will check Lee Eunchae's level first.

1446
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:43,861
Please.

1447
01:04:43,861 --> 01:04:45,392
Oh, my.

1448
01:04:48,932 --> 01:04:51,202
- Join us. - Eunchae, join us.

1449
01:04:51,832 --> 01:04:52,861
Eunchae.

1450
01:04:53,972 --> 01:04:55,131
Don't stop.

1451
01:05:05,111 --> 01:05:06,182
This is killing me.

1452
01:05:08,812 --> 01:05:12,421
(Lee Eunchae fails to get promoted.)

1453
01:05:13,791 --> 01:05:18,821
(The girls are speechless at this unexpected result.)

1454
01:05:21,062 --> 01:05:22,762
Lee Eunchae is in Level M.

1455
01:05:23,861 --> 01:05:25,162
- Yes. - You failed to get promoted.

1456
01:05:25,332 --> 01:05:27,202
You will be eliminated.

1457
01:05:27,202 --> 01:05:30,472
(Lee Eunchae will be eliminated.)

1458
01:05:30,472 --> 01:05:32,041
Is there anything you would like to say?

1459
01:05:34,271 --> 01:05:36,271
It's disappointing that...

1460
01:05:37,782 --> 01:05:39,312
I got eliminated.

1461
01:05:41,251 --> 01:05:42,312
But...

1462
01:05:42,981 --> 01:05:44,151
up to this point,

1463
01:05:45,622 --> 01:05:50,291
I could pursue my dream with my fellow participants...

1464
01:05:51,262 --> 01:05:55,591
and friends who had the same dream. I was really happy that...

1465
01:05:56,231 --> 01:05:59,361
I got to work with the Unicorns.

1466
01:06:00,332 --> 01:06:01,472
I really was.

1467
01:06:03,001 --> 01:06:06,702
This isn't the end of my journey.

1468
01:06:07,512 --> 01:06:10,812
I hope you will continue to show me your support.

1469
01:06:10,812 --> 01:06:12,541
Thank you.

1470
01:06:17,852 --> 01:06:18,881
Good job.

1471
01:06:19,582 --> 01:06:21,251
Eunchae. You were great!

1472
01:06:24,521 --> 01:06:26,892
- You were great. - You have to get promoted, though.

1473
01:06:26,892 --> 01:06:27,892
You were good too!

1474
01:06:29,832 --> 01:06:30,861
Good job.

1475
01:06:32,702 --> 01:06:33,731
Oh, no.

1476
01:06:34,671 --> 01:06:36,932
- Good job, Eunchae. - Thank you.

1477
01:06:37,441 --> 01:06:39,802
- You were great. - Thank you.

1478
01:06:40,872 --> 01:06:42,972
With the last remaining member of Team "WHATEVA,"

1479
01:06:43,372 --> 01:06:46,182
we will check Jin Hyeonju's level.

1480
01:06:46,841 --> 01:06:49,352
- Why are they doing this to me? - Lee Huran.

1481
01:06:49,852 --> 01:06:51,481
- Come up to the stage. - What is this?

1482
01:06:52,452 --> 01:06:54,521
- No way. - This is so cruel.

1483
01:06:54,521 --> 01:06:55,552
(Lee Huran will check her level.)

1484
01:07:04,802 --> 01:07:07,102
They're the last ones to check their levels on Team "WHATEVA."

1485
01:07:07,372 --> 01:07:09,802
These two failed to get a ticket from the Unicorns,

1486
01:07:09,972 --> 01:07:12,972
and they must rely solely on the results of the Fan Ticketing.

1487
01:07:13,812 --> 01:07:17,111
How did the Fan Ticketing change...

1488
01:07:17,111 --> 01:07:18,642
their levels?

1489
01:07:18,642 --> 01:07:19,841
(What will happen to them?)

1490
01:07:20,111 --> 01:07:22,881
Let's find out their levels at the same time.

1491
01:07:22,881 --> 01:07:24,852
- Please let those two stay. - No way.

1492
01:07:26,852 --> 01:07:28,021
Come on, let's go.

1493
01:07:29,821 --> 01:07:31,091
I hope they both get promoted.

1494
01:07:34,332 --> 01:07:36,562
- They have to get promoted. - Come on.

1495
01:07:39,702 --> 01:07:40,731
Come on.

1496
01:07:41,302 --> 01:07:43,841
Come on.

1497
01:07:44,071 --> 01:07:45,602
Come on!

1498
01:07:45,602 --> 01:07:47,412
- They did it! - That's it!

1499
01:07:49,242 --> 01:07:50,782
That's a relief.

1500
01:07:50,981 --> 01:07:52,012
They did it.

1501
01:07:52,012 --> 01:07:53,512
(Rank 24, Lee Huran, Total: 36,589.9 points)

1502
01:07:53,512 --> 01:07:54,852
I'm so relieved.

1503
01:07:58,021 --> 01:08:01,021
This is the First Promotion Ceremony of Road to PRISM.

1504
01:08:01,521 --> 01:08:04,921
Along with the Unicorn Ticketing and the Fan Ticketing,

1505
01:08:05,091 --> 01:08:07,992
we have a new hidden kind of ticketing.

1506
01:08:07,992 --> 01:08:09,461
- Candy? - Candy?

1507
01:08:09,461 --> 01:08:12,362
Let's find out what kind of ticketing it is.

1508
01:08:13,902 --> 01:08:15,732
(The first night at the Universe Camp)

1509
01:08:16,302 --> 01:08:17,302
Everyone.

1510
01:08:17,302 --> 01:08:18,541
- Yes. - Yes.

1511
01:08:18,541 --> 01:08:19,841
Here in the Universe,

1512
01:08:19,841 --> 01:08:22,612
there are two ways to get yourselves promoted, right?

1513
01:08:22,612 --> 01:08:23,642
- Yes. - Yes.

1514
01:08:23,642 --> 01:08:24,982
First is the Unicorn Ticketing.

1515
01:08:24,982 --> 01:08:26,982
- The Fan Ticketing. - Second is the Fan Ticketing.

1516
01:08:26,982 --> 01:08:28,112
- Yes. - Yes.

1517
01:08:28,312 --> 01:08:30,152
- Actually, - "Actually"?

1518
01:08:30,152 --> 01:08:31,621
there is...

1519
01:08:32,352 --> 01:08:34,852
one more way to get promoted, through the hidden ticketing.

1520
01:08:35,052 --> 01:08:37,262
- Gosh, really? - Wait, what?

1521
01:08:38,921 --> 01:08:40,661
I was really surprised.

1522
01:08:41,331 --> 01:08:43,531
I never even imagined...

1523
01:08:43,531 --> 01:08:46,602
there would be another way.

1524
01:08:46,602 --> 01:08:48,371
I was so surprised.

1525
01:08:49,272 --> 01:08:50,472
Let me tell you what it is.

1526
01:08:50,472 --> 01:08:51,741
(The hidden ticketing for promotion)

1527
01:08:51,741 --> 01:08:53,341
- Could it be... - It's the Candy Ticketing.

1528
01:08:53,341 --> 01:08:56,772
(Candy Ticketing for promotion)

1529
01:08:58,482 --> 01:09:01,052
- I didn't see this coming. - I had no idea.

1530
01:09:01,052 --> 01:09:02,112
(The hidden ticketing that surprised everyone)

1531
01:09:02,112 --> 01:09:03,881
- Can you believe this? - Wait a minute.

1532
01:09:03,881 --> 01:09:05,852
I never even imagined it.

1533
01:09:06,352 --> 01:09:08,951
- Seriously? - The candy will be used here?

1534
01:09:09,451 --> 01:09:12,362
The word "candy" in the Candy Ticketing...

1535
01:09:12,562 --> 01:09:14,531
comes from the word "candidate."

1536
01:09:14,762 --> 01:09:17,331
We've conducted the Candy Voting...

1537
01:09:17,331 --> 01:09:20,531
to see who's earned the most recognition and support...

1538
01:09:20,531 --> 01:09:24,541
from the other candidates, and we'll promote that person.

1539
01:09:24,541 --> 01:09:26,442
The person who earned the most votes...

1540
01:09:26,741 --> 01:09:29,841
will be promoted to the next level.

1541
01:09:31,411 --> 01:09:33,312
- That's big. - Just one person?

1542
01:09:33,612 --> 01:09:35,012
I didn't see this coming.

1543
01:09:35,182 --> 01:09:39,022
I didn't really take the voting seriously,

1544
01:09:39,022 --> 01:09:41,392
so I was really surprised.

1545
01:09:41,591 --> 01:09:43,552
I never thought...

1546
01:09:43,892 --> 01:09:46,722
the Candy Voting would...

1547
01:09:46,722 --> 01:09:48,661
affect the promotion.

1548
01:09:48,661 --> 01:09:51,732
I didn't think that was something directly linked...

1549
01:09:51,732 --> 01:09:53,262
to our debut.

1550
01:09:53,762 --> 01:09:56,272
I was completely taken aback.

1551
01:09:56,671 --> 01:09:57,942
Can you believe this?

1552
01:09:57,942 --> 01:09:59,241
The candy.

1553
01:09:59,241 --> 01:10:00,472
(Who won the Candy Ticketing?)

1554
01:10:01,341 --> 01:10:03,541
(On a day of practice a month ago)

1555
01:10:03,541 --> 01:10:06,612
"Give this candy to the candidate that you're most grateful to."

1556
01:10:06,612 --> 01:10:07,812
- Gosh. - Gosh.

1557
01:10:07,812 --> 01:10:09,352
Hang on a second.

1558
01:10:09,352 --> 01:10:12,281
- "Give this candy." - What is this?

1559
01:10:12,281 --> 01:10:14,291
"On the label on the candy..."

1560
01:10:14,291 --> 01:10:16,522
- Here it is. You write your name. - You write your name on it,

1561
01:10:16,522 --> 01:10:18,461
and the name of the person you're most grateful to today.

1562
01:10:18,461 --> 01:10:20,022
- You're giving this candy... - Yes?

1563
01:10:20,022 --> 01:10:22,491
to the person you want to thank.

1564
01:10:22,491 --> 01:10:24,932
- To the person you want to thank. - As a thank-you.

1565
01:10:24,932 --> 01:10:26,302
Like a gift.

1566
01:10:26,902 --> 01:10:28,701
- I see. - You write...

1567
01:10:28,701 --> 01:10:30,331
- What is this? - Look at this.

1568
01:10:30,331 --> 01:10:32,272
- This is like Secret Santa. - Exactly.

1569
01:10:32,272 --> 01:10:34,312
- What do I do? - Who should I give this to?

1570
01:10:34,312 --> 01:10:37,682
(Sweet candy and the candy box)

1571
01:10:37,982 --> 01:10:39,012
Oh, look.

1572
01:10:39,442 --> 01:10:41,711
The message has changed.

1573
01:10:42,881 --> 01:10:46,281
"Give this candy to the candidate with the best looks..."

1574
01:10:46,281 --> 01:10:47,692
"on Universe Ticket."

1575
01:10:48,591 --> 01:10:49,892
The best looks?

1576
01:10:53,591 --> 01:10:54,591
Looks?

1577
01:10:54,791 --> 01:10:56,161
That's hard to choose.

1578
01:10:56,531 --> 01:10:58,961
The candidate with the best looks...

1579
01:10:59,732 --> 01:11:02,171
on Universe Ticket? There are too many.

1580
01:11:03,972 --> 01:11:05,171
What do I do?

1581
01:11:05,171 --> 01:11:06,642
(Hesitant)

1582
01:11:06,871 --> 01:11:10,012
If it's the best-looking candidate, the only person...

1583
01:11:10,142 --> 01:11:11,682
that comes to my mind is Nana.

1584
01:11:11,682 --> 01:11:13,642
- It's Nana because... - I picked Nana.

1585
01:11:13,642 --> 01:11:16,581
The one with the best looks is Nana.

1586
01:11:16,781 --> 01:11:18,052
I chose Nana...

1587
01:11:18,052 --> 01:11:21,522
because she's one of the girls that I thought was...

1588
01:11:21,751 --> 01:11:25,862
the most beautiful from the moment I saw their profile pictures.

1589
01:11:25,862 --> 01:11:26,991
She's absolutely beautiful.

1590
01:11:26,991 --> 01:11:29,262
If you see her in person, her face is this small.

1591
01:11:29,262 --> 01:11:31,232
She's got those doe eyes,

1592
01:11:31,331 --> 01:11:32,831
and she has a tiny face.

1593
01:11:32,831 --> 01:11:34,102
She's so pretty.

1594
01:11:34,701 --> 01:11:36,531
- You're beautiful! - You're beautiful!

1595
01:11:36,871 --> 01:11:38,142
She's gorgeous.

1596
01:11:38,671 --> 01:11:39,701
I was blown away...

1597
01:11:40,602 --> 01:11:42,541
by her beauty from the moment I saw her.

1598
01:11:42,711 --> 01:11:43,812
I love you.

1599
01:11:45,012 --> 01:11:46,442
(During the Level Station)

1600
01:11:46,442 --> 01:11:49,381
Nana always looks so beautiful.

1601
01:11:49,381 --> 01:11:52,152
- She's an eye-catcher for sure. - Really.

1602
01:11:52,921 --> 01:11:55,022
(The Unicorns also think she's an eye-catcher.)

1603
01:11:55,451 --> 01:11:58,022
(Nana is chosen as the candidate with the best looks.)

1604
01:11:58,461 --> 01:12:00,862
I picked Nana this time as well.

1605
01:12:00,862 --> 01:12:04,631
I think I've picked her for many things so far.

1606
01:12:04,631 --> 01:12:06,902
Nana is the one who's born to be an idol.

1607
01:12:06,902 --> 01:12:08,572
It's definitely Nana, guys.

1608
01:12:08,671 --> 01:12:10,402
"Born to be an idol"?

1609
01:12:11,201 --> 01:12:12,472
"Born to be an idol"?

1610
01:12:13,241 --> 01:12:15,411
I bet everyone will think of one person.

1611
01:12:16,112 --> 01:12:17,911
One person comes to my mind.

1612
01:12:18,581 --> 01:12:21,711
The candidate who's born to be an idol is...

1613
01:12:21,881 --> 01:12:23,411
Lim Seowon.

1614
01:12:23,411 --> 01:12:25,121
Lim Seowon.

1615
01:12:25,121 --> 01:12:26,482
It's Lim Seowon.

1616
01:12:26,822 --> 01:12:31,062
(Lim Seowon is chosen as the one who's born to be an idol.)

1617
01:12:31,291 --> 01:12:34,031
By looking at Seowon's facial expressions onstage...

1618
01:12:34,392 --> 01:12:38,062
and her skills, I feel like she's born to be an idol.

1619
01:12:38,062 --> 01:12:40,102
Seowon may be young, but...

1620
01:12:40,102 --> 01:12:41,732
Which camera should I look at?

1621
01:12:44,802 --> 01:12:48,171
She just has a natural talent.

1622
01:12:50,171 --> 01:12:51,642
She's a very talented kid.

1623
01:12:51,642 --> 01:12:54,211
She's very much like an idol singer.

1624
01:12:54,352 --> 01:12:57,552
I'll give the candy to Seowon today.

1625
01:12:57,552 --> 01:13:00,182
(Lim Seowon is chosen as the one who's born to be an idol.)

1626
01:13:01,022 --> 01:13:02,222
Kotoko.

1627
01:13:02,652 --> 01:13:04,192
Kotoko.

1628
01:13:04,192 --> 01:13:05,522
She's adorable.

1629
01:13:05,621 --> 01:13:06,621
Kotoko.

1630
01:13:07,121 --> 01:13:08,732
Kotoko is so cute.

1631
01:13:08,732 --> 01:13:10,192
(The person who often gets candy from Seowon)

1632
01:13:10,192 --> 01:13:11,762
I choose Kotoko.

1633
01:13:12,302 --> 01:13:16,671
(Kotoko, the cutie of Universe Ticket)

1634
01:13:16,902 --> 01:13:19,201
I pick Kotoko as the candidate with the best looks.

1635
01:13:19,201 --> 01:13:21,741
The most popular candidate is Kotoko.

1636
01:13:21,741 --> 01:13:23,841
The best ending fairy is...

1637
01:13:24,281 --> 01:13:25,741
Kotoko.

1638
01:13:25,942 --> 01:13:28,781
(They chose Kotoko for many different things.)

1639
01:13:29,012 --> 01:13:31,751
(Kotoko received most candies for...)

1640
01:13:31,921 --> 01:13:33,982
"Who's shown most growth in Universe Ticket?"

1641
01:13:34,451 --> 01:13:35,791
It's Kotoko.

1642
01:13:35,791 --> 01:13:39,091
The one who's shown most growth. I'll choose Kotoko.

1643
01:13:39,591 --> 01:13:41,461
For the 1-on-1 Battle,

1644
01:13:41,461 --> 01:13:43,232
Kotoko performed "POP!"

1645
01:13:43,232 --> 01:13:47,161
I thought she was cute like a little girl.

1646
01:13:47,161 --> 01:13:49,371
But in the next round, she performed "Dolphin,"

1647
01:13:49,371 --> 01:13:51,371
and she showed a new side of her.

1648
01:13:51,371 --> 01:13:55,272
When she was recording "Superstar,"

1649
01:13:55,272 --> 01:13:57,211
we were all surprised.

1650
01:13:57,211 --> 01:13:58,711
She was great.

1651
01:13:58,711 --> 01:14:00,951
She had improved so much.

1652
01:14:01,512 --> 01:14:06,552
(Kotoko did the highlight of "Superstar.")

1653
01:14:06,921 --> 01:14:09,091
- What? - She sounds great.

1654
01:14:09,091 --> 01:14:12,461
(Even the producers were surprised by her singing.)

1655
01:14:13,161 --> 01:14:15,562
Kotoko is a good singer,

1656
01:14:15,562 --> 01:14:17,461
and she's a great dancer too.

1657
01:14:17,461 --> 01:14:19,631
She keeps improving.

1658
01:14:19,762 --> 01:14:21,602
She's grown a lot,

1659
01:14:22,302 --> 01:14:25,341
so I'll give this to Kotoko.

1660
01:14:25,341 --> 01:14:28,812
(Kotoko is chosen as the candidate who's shown most growth.)

1661
01:14:29,371 --> 01:14:32,381
The Candy Voting is about gaining recognition...

1662
01:14:32,381 --> 01:14:34,781
and being appreciated by the other candidates.

1663
01:14:34,911 --> 01:14:38,781
So it feels like...

1664
01:14:38,781 --> 01:14:41,852
it's a little more special way to get promoted.

1665
01:14:41,991 --> 01:14:45,522
The people who watch you most closely...

1666
01:14:45,522 --> 01:14:47,392
are the other candidates,

1667
01:14:47,591 --> 01:14:51,001
which makes the candy more meaningful.

1668
01:14:51,631 --> 01:14:52,961
Enjoy the candy.

1669
01:14:53,201 --> 01:14:54,272
I love you.

1670
01:14:54,272 --> 01:14:55,272
I love you.

1671
01:14:56,272 --> 01:14:58,602
(Only one of them can get promoted through the Candy Ticketing.)

1672
01:14:58,602 --> 01:14:59,642
Good luck.

1673
01:15:00,272 --> 01:15:01,472
Bye.

1674
01:15:02,512 --> 01:15:06,142
(Who will that be?)

1675
01:15:07,182 --> 01:15:11,121
We've conducted ten rounds of the Candy Voting so far.

1676
01:15:11,652 --> 01:15:12,982
I will now...

1677
01:15:13,581 --> 01:15:17,152
tell you the two people who received the most votes.

1678
01:15:17,152 --> 01:15:18,722
- And only one of them will win? - Good for them.

1679
01:15:20,791 --> 01:15:22,461
Just one person? Gosh.

1680
01:15:22,461 --> 01:15:24,531
- Only one of them gets promoted? - This is interesting.

1681
01:15:24,862 --> 01:15:27,331
The first person who may win the Candy Ticketing is...

1682
01:15:28,602 --> 01:15:30,802
It'd be great if I get promoted...

1683
01:15:30,802 --> 01:15:33,942
as I gain recognition from my peers.

1684
01:15:34,972 --> 01:15:37,741
I somewhat felt confident.

1685
01:15:38,482 --> 01:15:41,182
I was confident.

1686
01:15:42,852 --> 01:15:43,852
Nana.

1687
01:15:45,522 --> 01:15:47,921
(The first possible winner of the Candy Ticketing is Nana.)

1688
01:15:47,921 --> 01:15:50,352
Thank you.

1689
01:15:52,222 --> 01:15:54,732
- Congratulations. - The second possible winner is...

1690
01:15:57,732 --> 01:15:58,802
Kotoko.

1691
01:16:00,201 --> 01:16:03,932
(The second possible winner of the Candy Ticketing is Kotoko.)

1692
01:16:04,102 --> 01:16:05,642
Between the two of them,

1693
01:16:06,671 --> 01:16:08,612
- I'm excited. - who will get promoted...

1694
01:16:08,612 --> 01:16:09,772
through the Candy Ticketing?

1695
01:16:09,772 --> 01:16:11,642
(Who will get promoted with their peers' appreciation?)

1696
01:16:12,442 --> 01:16:14,751
The winner of the Candy Ticketing...

1697
01:16:15,251 --> 01:16:17,012
will be promoted to Level I.

1698
01:16:17,751 --> 01:16:21,491
Which of them will be promoted to Level I?

1699
01:16:22,652 --> 01:16:24,921
Before we find out the result,

1700
01:16:25,392 --> 01:16:27,631
let me tell you that the winner won by...

1701
01:16:30,291 --> 01:16:31,562
only one vote.

1702
01:16:31,562 --> 01:16:34,802
(Their fates were changed by the 1 vote.)

1703
01:16:35,001 --> 01:16:38,171
The winner of the promotion chosen by Universe Ticket candidates.

1704
01:16:39,001 --> 01:16:40,472
The winner of the Candy Ticketing.

1705
01:16:41,711 --> 01:16:43,411
Let's find out now.

1706
01:16:47,881 --> 01:16:49,012
Who is it?

1707
01:16:58,491 --> 01:17:01,131
(The winner of the Candy Ticketing is Nana.)

1708
01:17:03,932 --> 01:17:08,072
Nana has been promoted to Level I through the Candy Ticketing.

1709
01:17:08,772 --> 01:17:10,201
Thank you.

1710
01:17:11,402 --> 01:17:12,871
Please tell us how you feel.

1711
01:17:13,302 --> 01:17:14,312
Yes.

1712
01:17:17,741 --> 01:17:18,881
Thank you.

1713
01:17:19,812 --> 01:17:22,881
I didn't think...

1714
01:17:23,781 --> 01:17:24,982
I'd get...

1715
01:17:26,121 --> 01:17:29,022
the most Candy Votes, and it was a big surprise.

1716
01:17:31,291 --> 01:17:33,161
Thank you so much, everyone.

1717
01:17:33,161 --> 01:17:34,262
I love you.

1718
01:17:34,262 --> 01:17:35,392
Thank you.

1719
01:17:35,591 --> 01:17:36,862
I love you too.

1720
01:17:37,762 --> 01:17:39,001
Nana is so cute.

1721
01:17:39,302 --> 01:17:40,302
Congratulations.

1722
01:17:40,302 --> 01:17:41,472
Thank you.

1723
01:17:41,472 --> 01:17:42,671
- Thank you. - Congratulations.

1724
01:17:42,701 --> 01:17:44,871
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

1725
01:17:44,972 --> 01:17:46,142
Thank you.

1726
01:17:46,572 --> 01:17:48,211
Congratulations.

1727
01:17:49,142 --> 01:17:50,972
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

1728
01:17:51,142 --> 01:17:52,612
Gosh.

1729
01:17:53,411 --> 01:17:54,911
Nana might make her debut.

1730
01:17:56,951 --> 01:17:57,982
Good job.

1731
01:17:58,751 --> 01:18:00,621
The next candidates to check their levels are...

1732
01:18:01,421 --> 01:18:02,852
- Nizi... - Nizi?

1733
01:18:04,562 --> 01:18:06,262
- and Yona. - Nizi.

1734
01:18:07,062 --> 01:18:08,161
- Right. - Me?

1735
01:18:08,161 --> 01:18:09,631
(Nizi and Yona will check their levels.)

1736
01:18:09,732 --> 01:18:12,262
- Let's go, Nizi. - Good luck.

1737
01:18:12,762 --> 01:18:17,501
(What will happen to the two of them?)

1738
01:18:23,442 --> 01:18:25,381
The levels of the two candidates...

1739
01:18:25,381 --> 01:18:26,812
- Right away? - will be revealed now.

1740
01:18:26,812 --> 01:18:27,911
Right away?

1741
01:18:28,211 --> 01:18:29,352
- Oh, boy. - Just like this?

1742
01:18:29,352 --> 01:18:30,381
They must be so nervous.

1743
01:18:33,482 --> 01:18:34,751
Go.

1744
01:18:34,791 --> 01:18:36,751
- Go straight up. - Let's go.

1745
01:18:36,791 --> 01:18:38,562
- Go straight up. - Come on.

1746
01:18:38,562 --> 01:18:39,621
Please.

1747
01:18:40,322 --> 01:18:41,362
Please.

1748
01:18:41,461 --> 01:18:42,531
Please.

1749
01:18:43,262 --> 01:18:44,291
Please.

1750
01:18:46,262 --> 01:18:47,461
She made it.

1751
01:18:50,831 --> 01:18:54,541
Nizi and Yona are now in Level S, and they get to continue...

1752
01:18:54,541 --> 01:18:56,911
their journey in the Universe.

1753
01:18:57,442 --> 01:18:59,982
Nizi is currently ranked number 19,

1754
01:19:00,081 --> 01:19:02,482
but she was ranked number 29 in the Fan Ticketing,

1755
01:19:02,581 --> 01:19:04,921
and she was one of the candidates that could've been eliminated.

1756
01:19:07,052 --> 01:19:11,022
I could've been eliminated,

1757
01:19:11,621 --> 01:19:15,192
but thankfully, I was chosen by the Unicorns,

1758
01:19:15,192 --> 01:19:17,432
and I'm really glad.

1759
01:19:18,331 --> 01:19:25,302
I hope you'll continue to support me.

1760
01:19:26,201 --> 01:19:27,442
Thank you.

1761
01:19:27,442 --> 01:19:30,442
(They get to continue their journey in the Universe.)

1762
01:19:30,442 --> 01:19:33,081
- I'm so happy. - What a relief.

1763
01:19:37,381 --> 01:19:39,781
Three candidates have been eliminated so far.

1764
01:19:40,982 --> 01:19:44,322
Let me tell you how many more people will be eliminated today.

1765
01:19:45,762 --> 01:19:47,862
- Please. - They'll tell us in advance?

1766
01:19:47,862 --> 01:19:49,631
- I hope it's none. - There's more?

1767
01:19:50,031 --> 01:19:54,701
The number of people who will also be leaving the Universe today is...

1768
01:19:54,701 --> 01:19:59,741
(How many more candidates will be eliminated?)

1769
01:19:59,741 --> 01:20:00,841
Three.

1770
01:20:00,841 --> 01:20:02,041
(It's 3.)

1771
01:20:02,041 --> 01:20:03,211
- Gosh. - That's half of them.

1772
01:20:03,942 --> 01:20:05,482
Half of them will be eliminated?

1773
01:20:08,781 --> 01:20:10,482
So six will be eliminated in total.

1774
01:20:12,322 --> 01:20:13,522
First,

1775
01:20:13,522 --> 01:20:17,322
Heo Sunbin and Jeon Jinyeong, please come up to the stage.

1776
01:20:17,322 --> 01:20:22,791
(Heo Sunbin and Jeon Jinyeong will check their levels.)

1777
01:20:35,741 --> 01:20:37,442
They couldn't enjoy their team's victory...

1778
01:20:37,442 --> 01:20:40,841
as they were not chosen by the Unicorns.

1779
01:20:41,512 --> 01:20:44,951
Will they be able to finally smile today?

1780
01:20:45,022 --> 01:20:47,822
Let's find out their levels now.

1781
01:20:47,822 --> 01:20:50,652
(Heo Sunbin's and Jeon Jinyeong's levels will be revealed.)

1782
01:20:50,722 --> 01:20:51,791
Please.

1783
01:20:53,562 --> 01:20:55,631
- Come on, please. - They'll both get promoted?

1784
01:20:55,961 --> 01:20:57,932
Come on.

1785
01:20:57,932 --> 01:20:59,862
- Oh, my goodness. - Go. Keep going.

1786
01:20:59,862 --> 01:21:01,331
- Gosh. - Go.

1787
01:21:01,331 --> 01:21:02,472
Jinyeong.

1788
01:21:03,001 --> 01:21:04,871
- They'll both get promoted? - Jinyeong.

1789
01:21:07,472 --> 01:21:08,572
She was so close.

1790
01:21:08,572 --> 01:21:09,942
(Heo Sunbin fails to get promoted.)

1791
01:21:18,581 --> 01:21:21,892
Jun Jinyeong has been promoted to Level S,

1792
01:21:21,892 --> 01:21:23,692
and she will not be eliminated.

1793
01:21:24,421 --> 01:21:26,161
Please tell us how you feel.

1794
01:21:33,701 --> 01:21:35,402
Great job, Jinyeong!

1795
01:21:37,501 --> 01:21:40,142
I really thought I was going to be eliminated.

1796
01:21:44,341 --> 01:21:49,012
I'm overjoyed that I got promoted.

1797
01:21:51,052 --> 01:21:55,322
I want to thank my fans who got me here and supported me.

1798
01:21:55,322 --> 01:21:57,451
Thank you so much.

1799
01:21:59,262 --> 01:22:00,762
Thank you.

1800
01:22:06,302 --> 01:22:07,362
I...

1801
01:22:14,001 --> 01:22:16,472
I'm not happy about the result,

1802
01:22:16,472 --> 01:22:17,472
but...

1803
01:22:17,572 --> 01:22:19,482
I will try...

1804
01:22:20,741 --> 01:22:23,552
and be better when I see you next time.

1805
01:22:25,322 --> 01:22:28,451
(Heo Sunbin has been eliminated.)

1806
01:22:30,451 --> 01:22:33,822
Yuri and Kim Soobin, please come up to the stage.

1807
01:22:33,822 --> 01:22:36,031
(Yuri and Kim Soobin will check their levels.)

1808
01:22:36,031 --> 01:22:37,331
Oh, boy.

1809
01:22:46,572 --> 01:22:49,142
Now, there are two more candidates to be eliminated.

1810
01:22:50,041 --> 01:22:51,171
Let's find out...

1811
01:22:51,642 --> 01:22:53,442
the two candidates' levels.

1812
01:22:56,152 --> 01:22:58,222
Please.

1813
01:22:58,251 --> 01:22:59,421
Go on.

1814
01:22:59,951 --> 01:23:01,222
I hope they both make it.

1815
01:23:04,591 --> 01:23:06,562
(Kim Soobin fails to get promoted.)

1816
01:23:07,192 --> 01:23:08,331
That's terrible.

1817
01:23:13,001 --> 01:23:17,902
(Yuri has been promoted to Level S.)

1818
01:23:18,302 --> 01:23:23,312
(They're faced with different fates.)

1819
01:23:23,541 --> 01:23:26,012
Yuri has been promoted to Level S,

1820
01:23:26,041 --> 01:23:28,751
and she can continue her journey in the Universe.

1821
01:23:29,982 --> 01:23:31,251
Kim Soobin.

1822
01:23:31,951 --> 01:23:33,451
We appreciate your hard work so far.

1823
01:23:34,621 --> 01:23:36,991
While I was here,

1824
01:23:37,421 --> 01:23:39,892
I got to learn a lot from the other candidates...

1825
01:23:39,892 --> 01:23:41,892
through the competition and practice.

1826
01:23:41,892 --> 01:23:44,862
We made a lot of wonderful memories together.

1827
01:23:45,661 --> 01:23:47,862
I will continue to improve myself...

1828
01:23:47,862 --> 01:23:50,701
and work hard to achieve my dreams.

1829
01:23:50,701 --> 01:23:53,902
I hope you'll watch me and support me.

1830
01:23:53,902 --> 01:23:55,241
She's great.

1831
01:23:55,241 --> 01:23:56,472
She's a brave girl.

1832
01:23:56,711 --> 01:23:58,442
Good job. She worked hard.

1833
01:23:59,041 --> 01:24:01,652
Now, there are two candidates left to check their levels.

1834
01:24:01,652 --> 01:24:05,222
(There are 2 candidates left to check their levels.)

1835
01:24:05,552 --> 01:24:07,352
One of them will be eliminated.

1836
01:24:07,352 --> 01:24:09,121
(1 of the 2 will be eliminated.)

1837
01:24:09,121 --> 01:24:11,762
Who will be the last one to get promoted today...

1838
01:24:11,862 --> 01:24:15,192
and continue her journey in the Universe?

1839
01:24:16,262 --> 01:24:20,001
Hwang Sieun and Jang Sua, please come up to the stage.

1840
01:24:20,001 --> 01:24:26,642
(Hwang Sieun and Jang Sua will check their levels.)

1841
01:24:27,341 --> 01:24:31,112
(They stand at the crossroads of promotion and elimination.)

1842
01:24:37,951 --> 01:24:40,222
The First Promotion Ceremony of Universe Ticket.

1843
01:24:40,951 --> 01:24:44,552
The number of the candidate that can be promoted to Level S...

1844
01:24:45,022 --> 01:24:46,062
is only one now.

1845
01:24:47,862 --> 01:24:50,661
Hwang Sieun and Jang Sua face different fates.

1846
01:24:50,661 --> 01:24:53,661
What will happen to these two candidates?

1847
01:24:55,802 --> 01:24:57,201
Let's find out...

1848
01:24:57,201 --> 01:24:58,402
(Their levels will be revealed.)

1849
01:24:58,402 --> 01:24:59,602
their levels.

1850
01:25:00,871 --> 01:25:01,942
Let's go.

1851
01:25:02,612 --> 01:25:05,581
- How could anyone decide this? - I can't watch.

1852
01:25:05,581 --> 01:25:06,642
I really don't know.

1853
01:25:06,642 --> 01:25:08,381
- Please. - Please.

1854
01:25:09,512 --> 01:25:11,552
I really don't know.

1855
01:25:12,251 --> 01:25:13,581
- Please. - Please.

1856
01:25:13,581 --> 01:25:15,052
I really don't know.

1857
01:25:15,052 --> 01:25:16,552
(To be continued shortly)

1858
01:25:17,501 --> 01:25:18,831
Let's find out...

1859
01:25:20,201 --> 01:25:21,371
their levels.

1860
01:25:21,371 --> 01:25:22,602
(Their levels will be revealed.)

1861
01:25:22,642 --> 01:25:23,701
Let's go.

1862
01:25:24,371 --> 01:25:27,241
- How could anyone decide this? - I can't watch.

1863
01:25:27,241 --> 01:25:28,341
I really don't know.

1864
01:25:28,341 --> 01:25:30,211
- Please. - Please.

1865
01:25:31,642 --> 01:25:33,211
I really don't know.

1866
01:25:33,951 --> 01:25:35,381
- Please. - Please.

1867
01:25:35,381 --> 01:25:36,951
I really don't know.

1868
01:25:38,222 --> 01:25:44,291
(Who will survive? And who will be eliminated?)

1869
01:25:44,362 --> 01:25:45,491
Please.

1870
01:25:51,432 --> 01:25:52,531
Oh, no.

1871
01:25:52,871 --> 01:25:59,541
(Jang Sua fails to get promoted.)

1872
01:26:00,642 --> 01:26:02,142
The last member to be promoted...

1873
01:26:02,711 --> 01:26:03,982
was Hwang Sieun.

1874
01:26:04,312 --> 01:26:06,581
She was promoted to Level S.

1875
01:26:07,812 --> 01:26:08,812
Seriously.

1876
01:26:10,621 --> 01:26:11,690
From now on,

1877
01:26:12,660 --> 01:26:15,860
I will work hard to show my good sides.

1878
01:26:16,030 --> 01:26:17,030
Thank you.

1879
01:26:22,570 --> 01:26:26,301
Jang Sua failed to get promoted and remained in Level M.

1880
01:26:26,440 --> 01:26:27,841
Her elimination has been confirmed.

1881
01:26:29,971 --> 01:26:31,740
(You can check out the scores on the official website.)

1882
01:26:32,110 --> 01:26:35,211
Now come the four members who were promoted to Level I,

1883
01:26:35,850 --> 01:26:37,780
Lim Seowon, Gehlee Dangca,

1884
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:40,581
Elisia, and Nana.

1885
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:43,121
We will check if there has been an additional promotion.

1886
01:26:44,221 --> 01:26:45,551
Among the four members,

1887
01:26:46,921 --> 01:26:48,360
Level R...

1888
01:26:48,360 --> 01:26:51,431
(Among the four members, Level R...)

1889
01:26:51,431 --> 01:26:52,900
- is present. - Really?

1890
01:26:54,461 --> 01:26:56,600
(Who will get promoted to Level R and step closer to the debut?)

1891
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:57,770
Someone is Level R.

1892
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:01,001
- What? - Someone is Level R. Only one.

1893
01:27:01,471 --> 01:27:02,841
I don't know. We don't know.

1894
01:27:05,471 --> 01:27:08,240
Which member will join Level R...

1895
01:27:08,240 --> 01:27:10,051
and become a candidate for debut?

1896
01:27:10,511 --> 01:27:12,211
Let's find out now.

1897
01:27:13,751 --> 01:27:14,751
Firstly,

1898
01:27:15,551 --> 01:27:16,591
Elisia...

1899
01:27:16,591 --> 01:27:20,020
(Elisia)

1900
01:27:20,020 --> 01:27:22,931
and Gehlee Dangca, please come up to the stage.

1901
01:27:24,391 --> 01:27:26,801
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1902
01:27:28,461 --> 01:27:30,030
Elisia and Gehlee Dangca...

1903
01:27:30,030 --> 01:27:33,240
are the only two Filipino members of Universe Ticket.

1904
01:27:33,641 --> 01:27:37,440
They placed 1st and 2nd in Fan Ticketing.

1905
01:27:39,011 --> 01:27:41,081
Let's check out the two members' levels.

1906
01:27:43,350 --> 01:27:44,711
- Here we go. - My goodness.

1907
01:27:44,711 --> 01:27:46,921
- Here we go. - They came a long way from Level M.

1908
01:27:46,921 --> 01:27:48,681
- It's fast. - It's fast.

1909
01:27:48,681 --> 01:27:49,891
When will it stop?

1910
01:27:50,291 --> 01:27:51,421
- When will it stop? - Will both of them get promoted?

1911
01:27:51,421 --> 01:27:52,421
So close.

1912
01:27:53,660 --> 01:27:54,820
It's nearly there.

1913
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:58,891
Currently, Gehlee Dangca is in second place...

1914
01:27:59,331 --> 01:28:01,431
and Elisia is in third place.

1915
01:28:01,431 --> 01:28:03,331
They took a step closer to debut.

1916
01:28:04,070 --> 01:28:05,100
I envy them.

1917
01:28:05,100 --> 01:28:06,341
(The two Filipino participants took a step closer to debut.)

1918
01:28:06,341 --> 01:28:07,400
Same level.

1919
01:28:08,070 --> 01:28:09,100
Let's go.

1920
01:28:11,671 --> 01:28:13,011
- Thank you. - They are so cute.

1921
01:28:13,011 --> 01:28:14,541
Thank you so much.

1922
01:28:14,541 --> 01:28:15,641
I love you.

1923
01:28:19,081 --> 01:28:20,850
They are so cute.

1924
01:28:21,081 --> 01:28:23,450
- Thank you. - I love you.

1925
01:28:23,850 --> 01:28:25,221
The next Level R candidates are...

1926
01:28:25,990 --> 01:28:27,060
Lim Seowon...

1927
01:28:27,820 --> 01:28:28,860
and Nana.

1928
01:28:28,860 --> 01:28:30,560
(The next Level R candidates are Lim Seowon and Nana.)

1929
01:28:30,891 --> 01:28:34,060
The 2 participants met on the stage for the 1st time...

1930
01:28:34,060 --> 01:28:35,761
for the only seat in Level R.

1931
01:28:37,770 --> 01:28:41,240
Who will move up 3 levels in the 1st Promotion Ceremony...

1932
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:43,471
and join Level R?

1933
01:28:44,471 --> 01:28:47,240
Will it be Lim Seowon, the one who moved up two levels...

1934
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:48,940
through Fan Ticketing?

1935
01:28:49,410 --> 01:28:54,121
Will Nana rule Fan Ticketing, Unicorn Ticketing,

1936
01:28:54,421 --> 01:28:56,421
and Candy Ticketing?

1937
01:28:58,020 --> 01:29:00,591
Let's check the two participants' levels.

1938
01:29:00,591 --> 01:29:02,961
(Who will join Level R?)

1939
01:29:04,803 --> 01:29:07,432
Let's check the two participants' levels.

1940
01:29:07,432 --> 01:29:09,533
(Who will join Level R?)

1941
01:29:10,173 --> 01:29:11,942
Let's go.

1942
01:29:14,012 --> 01:29:15,043
I am so nervous.

1943
01:29:17,312 --> 01:29:18,383
So fast.

1944
01:29:20,213 --> 01:29:21,652
Nana.

1945
01:29:21,812 --> 01:29:24,583
- That's incredible. - Nana.

1946
01:29:24,583 --> 01:29:27,522
(Nana's gauge continues to go up.)

1947
01:29:27,522 --> 01:29:28,522
Congratulations.

1948
01:29:30,022 --> 01:29:31,022
She joined Level R.

1949
01:29:32,692 --> 01:29:36,163
(Nana is the first member of Level R.)

1950
01:29:36,163 --> 01:29:37,163
Congratulations.

1951
01:29:40,062 --> 01:29:41,272
That's incredible.

1952
01:29:41,272 --> 01:29:42,833
- There is more. - It keeps going.

1953
01:29:46,243 --> 01:29:47,312
It keeps going.

1954
01:29:48,873 --> 01:29:50,543
Will her debut be finalized today?

1955
01:29:51,713 --> 01:29:53,243
She will debut.

1956
01:29:53,243 --> 01:29:55,482
Her debut has nearly been finalized.

1957
01:29:55,753 --> 01:29:59,923
We have the first participant who moved up to Level R.

1958
01:30:00,793 --> 01:30:02,593
Nana, congratulations.

1959
01:30:03,093 --> 01:30:04,123
Thank you.

1960
01:30:04,123 --> 01:30:07,232
(Thank you.)

1961
01:30:08,963 --> 01:30:13,533
To be honest, I thought...

1962
01:30:14,533 --> 01:30:16,402
that I wouldn't receive...

1963
01:30:17,572 --> 01:30:20,873
a high number of votes.

1964
01:30:21,812 --> 01:30:25,783
But so many people voted for me.

1965
01:30:26,043 --> 01:30:27,053
I am so...

1966
01:30:28,612 --> 01:30:30,322
I am so happy.

1967
01:30:30,322 --> 01:30:32,383
(I am so happy.)

1968
01:30:32,383 --> 01:30:33,822
Still,

1969
01:30:34,852 --> 01:30:38,392
I am lacking in many ways.

1970
01:30:38,762 --> 01:30:40,793
I will work harder...

1971
01:30:42,663 --> 01:30:48,803
and show my cooler sides in the future.

1972
01:30:50,173 --> 01:30:52,203
So please root for me. Thank you.

1973
01:30:57,083 --> 01:31:00,583
Lim Seowon has been promoted to Level I.

1974
01:31:02,012 --> 01:31:03,083
My goodness.

1975
01:31:04,583 --> 01:31:05,982
Go ahead.

1976
01:31:05,982 --> 01:31:07,293
(She is one step closer to realizing her dream of debuting.)

1977
01:31:07,293 --> 01:31:08,322
It's the center.

1978
01:31:08,923 --> 01:31:10,593
- Level R. - It's pretty.

1979
01:31:11,963 --> 01:31:13,892
- That's incredible. - On the king's stage.

1980
01:31:15,692 --> 01:31:19,602
(How will the next promotion war go?)

1981
01:31:19,602 --> 01:31:21,572
(Level R: Nana)

1982
01:31:21,572 --> 01:31:23,232

(Jeon Jinyeong, Yuri, Lee Huran)

1989
01:31:31,743 --> 01:31:33,043
Road to PRISM,

1990
01:31:33,383 --> 01:31:34,553
Unit Station...

1991
01:31:34,553 --> 01:31:36,253
begins now.

1992
01:31:36,713 --> 01:31:38,982
(Vocal, performance, visual)

1993
01:31:39,583 --> 01:31:42,022
(Unit Station will determine the best in each position.)

1994
01:31:43,093 --> 01:31:44,623
(What? That's mine.)

1995
01:31:45,862 --> 01:31:47,793
(To get promoted, they have fierce competition for positions.)

1996
01:31:48,133 --> 01:31:49,692
Nana sure is different.

1997
01:31:50,232 --> 01:31:52,102
I am confident that I will get promoted again.

1998
01:31:52,602 --> 01:31:53,663
Ta-da.

1999
01:31:54,503 --> 01:31:55,732
- How cute. - How cute.

2000
01:31:57,472 --> 01:31:58,803
Harder.

2001
01:32:01,072 --> 01:32:02,243
Okay. You did very well.

2002
01:32:02,442 --> 01:32:07,152
(A cutthroat contest for the main vocalist position)

2003
01:32:07,253 --> 01:32:09,453
(You are distracting when you sing.)

2004
01:32:09,453 --> 01:32:11,453
(You will get scolded a lot by the producers.)

2005
01:32:11,883 --> 01:32:13,822
(I am the only one who is falling behind.)

2006
01:32:14,623 --> 01:32:16,652
(I think I will get eliminated.)

2007
01:32:19,293 --> 01:32:21,293
(Will the girls pick the participants to be eliminated?)

2008
01:32:21,692 --> 01:32:24,463
(The elimination candidate I picked is...)

2009
01:32:25,163 --> 01:32:27,432
(What will be the result of the girls' war of nerves?)

2010
01:32:28,272 --> 01:32:30,102
