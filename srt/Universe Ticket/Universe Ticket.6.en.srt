The two low teams, please come up on stage.

52
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,669
They must feel nervous.

53
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,970
Don't feel nervous.

54
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,109
Let's go!

55
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,139
- Let's go! - Let's go!

56
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:31,178
- Hello. - Hello.

(Low team, Team Volcano)

58

59
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:37,590
Hello.

60
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,618
What? They look amazing.

61
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:41,089
- Hello. - Hello.

62
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,358
(Low team, Team Bulldozer)

63
00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:44,130
Hello.

64
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:49,629
These two teams must be the most competitive.

65
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,469
- Right. - Because of all the eliminations.

66
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,709
The losing team will face 4 eliminations.

67
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:58,909
Right. So many of them will get eliminated here.

68
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,980
There will be 2 promotions and 4 eliminations.

69
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:05,079
(During the announcement of the Level Test results)

70
00:04:05,149 --> 00:04:06,449
Lim Seowon.

71
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:11,590
(The high and average groups got called out first.)

72
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:17,559
(The low group contestants were left.)

73
00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:19,660
You're my ticket to you

74
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:23,270
(Kwon Eunhyung lip-synced during the Level Test.)

75
00:04:23,299 --> 00:04:26,769
It's not like you're performing on a TV music show now.

76
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,909
- Right. - Everyone here is shy.

77
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:33,580
But they all just try their best to sing even if it wasn't perfect.

78
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,210
You, you, you

79
00:04:35,679 --> 00:04:37,009
You, you, you

80
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:39,020
Days that are like a miracle

81
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:40,589
You're my ticket to you

82
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:44,219
I'm sorry. You're singing was too quiet. I couldn't hear it.

83
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,429
It looked like she was struggling. Even with the dancing.

84
00:04:47,489 --> 00:04:50,058
I don't really have anything to say.

85
00:04:50,059 --> 00:04:51,558
(The Unicorns' direct comments continue.)

86
00:04:51,559 --> 00:04:54,099
I was most concerned about...

87
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,469
how much the low group...

88
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:59,099
could put together the song.

89
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,569
I was really worried.

90
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:05,339
I worked really hard until now.

91
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,580
I was in tears because of the result.

92
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,209
Everyone has lost their confidence.

93
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:13,318
But we all had to make it work for this mission.

94
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:16,548
"Will we be able to pull this off?"

95
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:19,359
I was constantly thinking that.

96
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,558
(The first encounter with the producers)

97
00:05:21,559 --> 00:05:23,090
Hello.

98
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,200
Hello.

99
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,859
Hello.

100
00:05:27,129 --> 00:05:28,769
Hello, everyone.

101
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,329
- Hello. - Hello.

102
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,738
It's been a while. I'm ADORA.

103
00:05:32,739 --> 00:05:34,438
I'm Nano of VENDORS. Nice to meet you.

104
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:36,140
- Hello. - Hello.

105
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,279
Hello. We're GALACTIKA.

106
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,549
I'm Friday.

107
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,549
- I'm Chang. - Nice to meet you.

108
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:45,519
(They produced the best K-pop songs like...)

109
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:53,289
(ITZY's "DALLA DALLA," "LOCO," and TWICE's "SET ME FREE.")

110
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:56,989
(A producing team that produces trendy K-pop, GALACTIKA)

111
00:06:00,299 --> 00:06:03,029
Do you all know that a loss here...

112
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:06,699
will lead to four eliminations?

113
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,709
- Yes. - Yes.

114
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:10,479
One mistake here...

115
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,238
will be too costly.

116
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:16,748
You must go through this with desperate hearts.

117
00:06:16,749 --> 00:06:20,020
I think it's a bit too harsh for four people to get eliminated.

118
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,989
I don't want to go home. Please.

119
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:26,859
I was worried if I could get promoted.

120
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:29,530
Gehlee Dangca, you look like you're about to cry.

121
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,259
- You look down. - You look like you're crying.

122
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,869
- I'm okay. - You are?

123
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:35,400
Don't feel down.

124
00:06:35,869 --> 00:06:39,040
I feel kind of sad that I was in the low rank team.

125
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:42,540
To be honest, I was a little intimidated.

126
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:48,579
You'll need to bring out more energy...

127
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:51,079
for this performance. You all look down.

128
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,748
Bring up the energy levels to the highest.

129
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:55,688
For the song you'll perform,

130
00:06:55,689 --> 00:06:57,959
I hope you'll all show what you've been practicing...

131
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,459
and put on the best performance.

132
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,559
- Okay. - Okay.

133
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:05,829
We'll start with Team Volcano.

134
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:09,368
Team Bulldozer, please wait behind the stage.

135
00:07:09,369 --> 00:07:10,399
- Okay. - Okay.

136
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,400
- Let's go! - Let's go!

137
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,770
Do well!

138
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,580
(GALACTIKA'S Friday and Chang)

139
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:25,279
You have worked with...

140
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,248
both the high and low groups.

141
00:07:27,249 --> 00:07:31,290
Was there a specific difference from both groups?

142
00:07:31,489 --> 00:07:33,819
As for the lower group,

143
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,599
we wanted to really pull up their energy levels...

144
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,399
while we were leading the production.

145
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,428
We kept considering...

146
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:48,069
how to make them feel less intimidated.

147
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:49,869
We ate together.

148
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:54,410
We did our best to cheer them on.

149
00:07:54,679 --> 00:07:59,049
I think we've focused on those aspects for this group.

150
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:04,460
We've worked on this song.

151
00:08:04,689 --> 00:08:06,558
It's Deux's "As I Told You."

152
00:08:06,559 --> 00:08:07,628
("As I Told You" by Deux)

153
00:08:07,629 --> 00:08:08,759
I love this song.

154
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:14,230
(A legendary hip-hop song that conquered the 90s)

155
00:08:14,669 --> 00:08:16,399
BTS and Stray Kids.

156
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,739
Different boy groups did a lot of covers.

157
00:08:18,939 --> 00:08:20,869
It was a song that inspired many.

158
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:26,079
The song possesses the current trend...

159
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,048
and the nostalgic vibes from back then.

160
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,618
It will feel very charming with your performance.

161
00:08:30,619 --> 00:08:31,719
Shall we listen to it together?

162
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,749
- Yes! - Yes!

163
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:36,849
(A slight taste of GALACTIKA's "As I Told You")

164
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:37,919
It's nice.

165
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,488
They've completely changed it.

166
00:08:39,489 --> 00:08:40,830
- Right from the start. - Right.

167
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,600
I love it.

168
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,269
Gosh. I love the song.

169
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,799
- It's really nice. - It's great.

170
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,399
(A brighter "As I Told You" than the original)

171
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,069
It feels very bright.

172
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,209
I like this song.

173
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:57,639
- I love it. - I know this song.

174
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,149
I believe our members will do well.

175
00:09:01,379 --> 00:09:02,950
- We will do well. - We fully trust them.

176
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,748
I loved the song.

177
00:09:05,749 --> 00:09:08,089
The melody and overall vibes...

178
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,190
helped me gain confidence.

179
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,258
(The next day at the GALACTIKA studio)

180
00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:14,060
- Hello. - Hello.

181
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:15,789
We're the challengers.

182
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:18,258
- Let's not use the word "low." - Okay.

183
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:20,998
Did you all find a part that you wanted?

184
00:09:20,999 --> 00:09:22,128
- Yes. - Yes.

185
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:23,330
You all sound ready for this.

186
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,238
Shall we take turns saying the parts you want?

187
00:09:27,239 --> 00:09:30,809
I want Part Three.

188
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:32,709
- I want Part Four. - Okay.

189
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:35,850
In the choreography, that part is in the center often.

190
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,579
The vocal range of that part also seemed suitable for me.

191
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,189
You've thought about the overall picture of the song.

192
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,519
- You must like being in the center. - You're right.

193
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,888
I also want Part Four.

194
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:46,959
- Part Four? - Yes.

195
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:51,059
I want Part 3 or Part 4.

196
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:54,230
So a lot of you want Part 3 or Part 4.

197
00:09:54,629 --> 00:09:59,739
(The highlight where you can take the spotlight in the center)

198
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,039
(Who will take Part 4?)

199
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:05,279
Shall we give it a try?

200
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,539
Let's go.

201
00:10:07,909 --> 00:10:11,019
(Minari starts singing.)

202
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:14,550
I'm always looking down in front of you

203
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:16,189
I love your tone.

204
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,758
It feels natural.

205
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:19,889
I love the cozy vibes that you have.

206
00:10:20,289 --> 00:10:26,359
(The members of Team Volcano work hard to earn their parts.)

207
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,600
The way I look foolish as I'm afraid

208
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:37,269
(How will the parts be distributed for Team Volcano?)

209
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,638
All right. We've decided on the parts.

210
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:41,710
- Right. - Right.

211
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:44,450
Part One will be given to Yewon.

212
00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:47,050
Oh, right. Thank you.

213
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,850
Part Two.

214
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,690
- Aya Natsumi. - Okay.

215
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:53,619
Part Three will be given to Minari.

216
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:56,259
(Nice!)

217
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:58,829
- Look at that reaction. - Thank you.

218
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,258
(Minari got the part she wanted.)

219
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:02,430
And now, Part Four.

220
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,969
I want to be in the center often.

221
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,639
I want to show myself more.

222
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:09,939
If I get Part Four,

223
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,108
I think I'll be able to show myself more.

224
00:11:12,109 --> 00:11:13,239
Part Four...

225
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,779
will be given to Sua.

226
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:18,278
Thank you.

227
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:19,549
(Jang Sua takes the highlight.)

228
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,049
- Part Five, Vanesya. - Thank you.

229
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:22,850
Part Six, Riel.

230
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,089
Let's work hard...

231
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,589
- for our team. - Okay.

232
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:28,529
In other words, let's take the win.

233
00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:30,329
Yes. We're going to win.

234
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,430
- Right. - Right.

235
00:11:31,529 --> 00:11:33,099
(After the exciting part distribution)

236
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,028
Although we don't want to be called it,

237
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:36,869
we're the low team. The challengers.

238
00:11:36,999 --> 00:11:39,440
For us to work hard,

239
00:11:39,739 --> 00:11:41,408
- we must eat good food. - Yes.

240
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,238
What's your favorite food?

241
00:11:43,239 --> 00:11:44,508
I like sundae.

242
00:11:44,509 --> 00:11:45,710
- Sundae? - Sundae?

243
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:46,839
That was totally unexpected.

244
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,479
Don't both Japan and the Philippines not have sundae?

245
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,579
Right. But after coming to Korea...

246
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,949
I gave it a try.

247
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:55,319
- It must've been good. - Right.

248
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,819
- It was really good. - That sounds good.

249
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,889
What about you, Riel?

250
00:11:58,019 --> 00:11:59,489
I like gukbap.

251
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,459
I had it really often when I was in school.

252
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,498
Really?

253
00:12:04,499 --> 00:12:06,059
- I loved it. - Since you were a student here.

254
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,600
What did you eat in your country, Vanesya?

255
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:10,100
Chicken. I love it.

256
00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:11,899
- Here it is. - It's here.

257
00:12:12,239 --> 00:12:15,408
(A hearty meal to recharge Team Volcano)

258
00:12:15,409 --> 00:12:16,469
Enjoy the food.

259
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,879
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you.

260
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,450
- Is it good? - It's amazing.

261
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:26,119
- Ramyeon? - Calm down.

262
00:12:26,649 --> 00:12:28,590
This is legendary.

263
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:30,748
It isn't spicy. What is this?

264
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:31,759
It's the thin skirt.

265
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,430
- Cheers! - Cheers!

266
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:36,429
- Cheers! - Just like that.

267
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:38,629
(Team Volcano's exciting meal)

268
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:41,869
Our team has a lot of members with great voices.

269
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:43,629
We have a great balance.

270
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:44,998
Thank you.

271
00:12:44,999 --> 00:12:46,599
As a result, we're going to win.

272
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,409
We have the better members.

273
00:12:48,539 --> 00:12:49,810
I love the energy.

274
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,480
Help her with the Korean lyrics.

275
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,580
Okay.

276
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,209
You should work on your pronunciation.

277
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,210
I can.

278
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:57,379
You can do it.

279
00:12:57,749 --> 00:12:59,050
If you win,

280
00:12:59,119 --> 00:13:00,180
I'll buy something even more delicious.

281
00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:02,288
- Okay. - Thank you.

282
00:13:02,289 --> 00:13:03,920
Their eyes are shining.

283
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,858
We will win, so I should think about what to eat.

284
00:13:07,859 --> 00:13:08,859
We have to win.

285
00:13:08,859 --> 00:13:09,859
- Okay. - You have to win and...

286
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,629
Finish your food first.

287
00:13:11,859 --> 00:13:12,859
No rush.

288
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,829
I'm sorry. I didn't even let you eat.

289
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,069
Anyway, good luck!

290
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:17,368
- Let's do this! - Let's do this!

291
00:13:17,369 --> 00:13:18,399
- Good luck. - Let's do this.

292
00:13:18,499 --> 00:13:20,570
(Level Station practice room)

293
00:13:20,909 --> 00:13:24,109
(Team Volcano is working on their dance moves.)

294
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,739
(Yewon leads the practice.)

295
00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:28,679
This is it.

296
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,009
Vanesya.

297
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,180
The leg. Power. And... Yes.

298
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:35,320
- And Sua needs to move a bit more. - Okay.

299
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:37,190
The height is uneven.

300
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,859
Sua, you can't be kicking like that.

301
00:13:41,659 --> 00:13:45,399
(The highlight where Sua dances in the center)

302
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:47,998
Mind your foot.

303
00:13:47,999 --> 00:13:50,499
It shouldn't go like this when you do the moves.

304
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,099
Actually,

305
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,810
it feels like I'm the only one who's worried.

306
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:58,739
(She led her team as a leader during the Revenge Battle.)

307
00:13:59,009 --> 00:14:05,619
(But Yewon didn't get much attention as an artist.)

308
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:07,220
Even if we win,

309
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,350
we have to make the top two.

310
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:14,019
That's what I'm worried about.

311
00:14:14,859 --> 00:14:17,330
Sua, now that you are performing the highlight,

312
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,830
you should work even harder.

313
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:25,199
I don't get to sing many parts,

314
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,570
so I'm worried that I might end up not being able to show anything.

315
00:14:29,909 --> 00:14:32,710
I think I'm a little anxious.

316
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,248
Mind the lines.

317
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:38,379
(The dance lesson continues with anxiety.)

318
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,680
It's not centered here.

319
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:44,190
Move a little more.

320
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,489
More!

321
00:14:47,489 --> 00:14:50,029
I'm afraid we're still not good enough.

322
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:54,600
There are things that aren't fixed. I wonder if we can change them.

323
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,268
More!

324
00:14:56,269 --> 00:14:57,429
(They keep practicing the moves, )

325
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,470
Rhythm!

326
00:14:58,499 --> 00:15:00,099
Push. Good.

327
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,368
(but they keep making mistakes.)

328
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:04,310
Don't relax.

329
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,179
If you're not used to the moves,

330
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,409
you should practice until you get used to them.

331
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:12,950
Your faces say that you're tired.

332
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,050
You should smile.

333
00:15:14,149 --> 00:15:16,549
I want you to understand...

334
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,789
- the vibe of the song. - Okay.

335
00:15:18,859 --> 00:15:21,059
It's not like someone is forcing you to do this.

336
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,789
(It's not like someone is forcing you to do this.)

337
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:26,560
(Team Volcano gathered again in the practice room the next day.)

338
00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:30,670
If we make a mistake, we will start again from the beginning.

339
00:15:30,999 --> 00:15:33,239
Vanesya, come forward a little more.

340
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,768
We will start again from the beginning.

341
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,840
One, two, three, four.

342
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,009
Again.

343
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,009
Are you sure you practiced?

344
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,378
(Staggering)

345
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:47,180
- Wait. - Let's do it again.

346
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,789
Don't do it half-heartedly.

347
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:51,690
When I see the members,

348
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:55,029
it feels like they accept the fact that they are low ranks.

349
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:57,359
Is that why they don't...

350
00:15:57,529 --> 00:15:59,359
seem desperate at all?

351
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:01,600
We will lose.

352
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,399
Is this right?

353
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,368
Do you think it's right?

354
00:16:05,369 --> 00:16:06,940
You have to do it harder.

355
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:09,609
We're practicing now.

356
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:10,739
Okay.

357
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:11,878
(They are not making progress with the dance.)

358
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:13,238
- Shall we start? - Yes.

359
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:14,239
(The recording day of Team Volcano)

360
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,550
- Sua. - Yes.

361
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:17,210
- Can you do well? - Yes.

362
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,220
- You practiced hard. - Yes.

363
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,749
Let's do it.

364
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:27,460
All those moments we shared weren't a coincidence

365
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:31,060
No. You don't sound coy at all.

366
00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:32,399
- Okay. - You should act coy.

367
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:38,069
(She tries singing again.)

368
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,369
Try to sound cuter.

369
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,800
We're working now.

370
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,969
- Okay. - You're an amateur...

371
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:43,039
if you can't do it.

372
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:45,339
- I see. - You're here to be a pro.

373
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,709
- You should focus more. - Yes.

374
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,249
- You should be acting. - Okay.

375
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:52,249
Which part did you want to sing the most?

376
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:54,279
Well, I wanted...

377
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,090
The one I wanted to sing was...

378
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:03,729
All those moments we shared weren't a coincidence

379
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:04,758
This part and...

380
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:10,069
(It's the highlight Sua just sang.)

381
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:16,470
(She tries singing Sua's part.)

382
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,140
That's really good.

383
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:19,710
We don't even need...

384
00:17:20,009 --> 00:17:21,949
to record it again.

385
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,909
Let's go with the good one for now.

386
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,049
Okay.

387
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,788
(Riel also tries singing Sua's part.)

388
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:30,889
- Okay. This part is better. - Okay.

389
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:32,720
- Let me hear you sing. - Okay.

390
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,088
I thought I might be able...

391
00:17:35,089 --> 00:17:38,029
to take the part if I did well.

392
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:44,499
I know I'm not as good as the other members.

393
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:49,870
I don't think I can sing as well as the older members.

394
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:53,979
But I don't want them to take the part away from me.

395
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,980
(But I don't want them to take the part away from me.)

396
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:02,420
All right. Team Volcano, please start your performance.

397
00:18:02,489 --> 00:18:03,549
- Okay. - Okay.

398
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:06,219
- Let's do this. - Let's do this.

399
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,720
You can do this!

400
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,930
(Will they be able to become one with their unstable teamwork?)

401
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:22,139
(Jang Sua)

402
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,308
(Riel)

403
00:18:23,309 --> 00:18:24,508
(Minari)

404
00:18:24,509 --> 00:18:25,940
(Aya Natsumi)

405
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,379
(Vanesya)

406
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,680
(Park Yewon)

407
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,548
("As I Told You" by Riel, Minary, )

408
00:18:33,549 --> 00:18:35,519
(Vanesya, Park Ye Won, Aya Natsumi, and Jang Sua)

409
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,400
They're lovely.

410
00:18:51,239 --> 00:18:52,370
So lovely.

411
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,838
(Sua got to keep her part.)

412
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:29,508
She's so cute.

413
00:19:29,509 --> 00:19:30,640
So adorable.

414
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:41,950
(Bang Yunha)

415
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,579
My gosh.

416
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,220
This is so cool.

417
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:46,509
- Gosh. - They're cute.

418
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:54,349
(Universe Ticket)

419
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,950
To be honest, your singing...

420
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,420
I even...

421
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,729
wondered if you ever practiced singing.

422
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:05,399
You have no understanding of the groove.

423
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,829
But I understand that the dance is powerful.

424
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,338
I should make allowances for that.

425
00:22:12,339 --> 00:22:15,410
But it didn't feel like you were trying to express something.

426
00:22:15,509 --> 00:22:17,209
You were just busy doing things.

427
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,808
You just tried to show the moves you memorized...

428
00:22:19,809 --> 00:22:22,249
and to sing your parts.

429
00:22:22,779 --> 00:22:25,479
Still, I could tell...

430
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,078
you were trying your best...

431
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:31,619
to show your talents with your moves and facial expressions.

432
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,620
But there were things that could've been better.

433
00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:37,059
I wonder how the two producers liked the performance.

434
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,299
You did well. It was good.

435
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:42,599
Well...

436
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,669
It would've been better...

437
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:46,670
if you looked a little more relaxed as the Unicorns said.

438
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:48,439
Our...

439
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,409
You're not just low ranks.

440
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,539
What's your team name?

441
00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:53,610
- Challengers. - You are Challengers.

442
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,809
I'd like you to praise yourself for your new challenge.

443
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:59,519
Don't cry. You did well.

444
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,049
I enjoyed it.

445
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,519
- Thank you. - Thank you for the good work.

446
00:23:02,989 --> 00:23:03,989
- Thank you. - Thank you.

447
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:08,960
There's something that's been weighing on my mind.

448
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,189
I was sad to hear that.

449
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:14,829
You had to do this mission...

450
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:17,400
because you were low ranks.

451
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:20,969
And I heard that you seemed quite dispirited...

452
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:22,768
while working with the producers.

453
00:23:22,769 --> 00:23:26,379
So the producers tried to cheer you guys up...

454
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,249
and give you confidence.

455
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,410
That's why they even took you out to a meal.

456
00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:31,650
And I was sad...

457
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,548
to see all that.

458
00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:35,689
If you are a low rank,

459
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:37,319
you should brace your energies...

460
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,919
and try even harder than others to make your way up...

461
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,759
with your team members.

462
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,689
You can learn from those who are good.

463
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,630
You have good role models here.

464
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:47,998
You should try to learn...

465
00:23:47,999 --> 00:23:51,029
from those who received praise.

466
00:23:51,269 --> 00:23:53,699
I'd like you to try...

467
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,739
to make the most out of this opportunity.

468
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,809
- Don't be sad. - Okay.

469
00:23:58,410 --> 00:23:59,679
Well done.

470
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,008
- Thank you. - Thank you.

471
00:24:01,009 --> 00:24:03,910
Team Volcano, please wait behind the stage.

472
00:24:06,849 --> 00:24:07,880
Well done.

473
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:13,019
Next is Team Bulldozer. Come up to the stage.

474
00:24:14,089 --> 00:24:15,089
(Team Bulldozer)

475
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:17,230
- Hello. - Hello.

476
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:19,059
Hello.

477
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:22,828
They must be nervous after watching the previous team.

478
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:23,829
I know.

479
00:24:25,099 --> 00:24:29,609
(But Team Bulldozer looks quite cheerful instead.)

480
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:31,239
Do you see Gehlee Dangca's left foot?

481
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:32,980
Do you see Gehlee Dangca's left foot?

482
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,809
That's her basic posture. I like it.

483
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:39,220
I like your posture, Dangca.

484
00:24:39,849 --> 00:24:41,149
- No. - I really like it.

485
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,620
We like it.

486
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,518
- She's pretty. - Gehlee looks like Tinker Bell.

487
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:47,160
- She's pretty. - She's so pretty.

488
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,460
All right. Our mission song is...

489
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:53,360
a big dance hit from the 1990s.

490
00:24:53,529 --> 00:24:55,098
It's "Nan" by CLON.

491
00:24:55,099 --> 00:24:58,738
(The peak of the dance music of the 1990s)

492
00:24:58,739 --> 00:25:03,109
This is a song with an impressive group dance.

493
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:06,509
We arranged the song for a charismatic girl group.

494
00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:09,779
It's totally different, so it's nothing like the original song.

495
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:13,720
Let's listen to the song.

496
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,548
- Okay. - Okay.

497
00:25:15,549 --> 00:25:18,019
(What is VENDORS' version of "Nan" like?)

498
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,989
It's so good.

499
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:26,900
(It's completely different from the original song.)

500
00:25:28,829 --> 00:25:30,769
I'm quite confident about this.

501
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,039
It's so good.

502
00:25:38,339 --> 00:25:39,380
Thank you.

503
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:40,880
It's really good.

504
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:42,650
Girl crush.

505
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:48,349
I was glad that I finally got to do what I'd always wanted.

506
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:50,489
It sounds really cool.

507
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:53,988
And I'm kind of excited to learn about it and to perform it...

508
00:25:53,989 --> 00:25:56,059
after hearing what they played.

509
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:59,029
First, we have to choose the leader.

510
00:25:59,259 --> 00:26:00,598
- Okay. - Let's do that.

511
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:01,599
Okay.

512
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,639
Does anyone of you want to be the leader?

513
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,640
(Raising her hand)

514
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:09,210
I want to do it.

515
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:11,610
Then it's settled.

516
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:13,439
- Is it okay with you? - Yes.

517
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,480
It's great.

518
00:26:15,049 --> 00:26:16,410
Congratulations.

519
00:26:16,579 --> 00:26:18,449
You're the leader. Please take good care of our team.

520
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:20,249
Thank you.

521
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:22,748
Only two of us will be able...

522
00:26:22,749 --> 00:26:24,018
to get promoted,

523
00:26:24,019 --> 00:26:25,588
so we're like rivals.

524
00:26:25,589 --> 00:26:28,259
I really wanted to outplay the team members.

525
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:32,199
But my goal is to win as a team.

526
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:37,528
On my team, I think I'm better than the other members,

527
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:40,169
so I want to be the leader...

528
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:45,910
and move up to a higher level with them.

529
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,779
- Narumi. - Yes.

530
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:50,479
- Please try singing. - Okay.

531
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,480
Narumi.

532
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:00,219
I'm grateful to you

533
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,488
She's good. I like it.

534
00:27:01,489 --> 00:27:03,860
For your false love

535
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:05,700
You're good.

536
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:07,299
- Nice. - Thank you.

537
00:27:07,299 --> 00:27:08,299
Really?

538
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,099
Narumi, I thought...

539
00:27:10,269 --> 00:27:13,999
you were only good at dancing.

540
00:27:14,239 --> 00:27:16,038
- But you also sing well. - She sings so well.

541
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:17,508
- Thank you. - You're a good singer.

542
00:27:17,509 --> 00:27:19,039
(Narumi is highly praised by VENDORS.)

543
00:27:20,309 --> 00:27:23,078
(Gehlee Dangca sings confidently.)

544
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:25,450
You've been fooling me

545
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:28,249
Pretending to be innocent

546
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,390
Okay.

547
00:27:30,089 --> 00:27:31,220
Thank you.

548
00:27:31,589 --> 00:27:33,319
- She's good. - You should speak English.

549
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:36,058
- Good. - It's so perfect.

550
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:38,028
(Perfect Gehlee)

551
00:27:38,029 --> 00:27:39,559
- It was really nice. - It really was.

552
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:43,829
(Next up is Kwon Eunhyung.)

553
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:48,839
I was really upset about your lies

554
00:27:49,009 --> 00:27:51,038
(She stops singing like she did during the level test.)

555
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:54,939
I'm grateful to you

556
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,009
My throat hurts.

557
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:03,149
I think I have the habit...

558
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:05,190
of lip-synching when I feel nervous.

559
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:11,659
(The vocal lesson after distributing the parts)

560
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,298
The cliche of goodbye

561
00:28:13,299 --> 00:28:15,829
You should relax your throat like this.

562
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:17,099
(Exhaling)

563
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:19,739
You just exhaled. You should make a sound.

564
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:26,239
(The lesson doesn't move forward because of Kwon Eunhyung.)

565
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:32,079
(She also looks flustered during the dance practice.)

566
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,318
And three and four.

567
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:36,048
And five, six.

568
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:37,120
I'm sorry.

569
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:38,860
From the left.

570
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:42,289
My gosh. Are you all right?

571
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,028
- It hurts. - Are you okay?

572
00:28:44,029 --> 00:28:45,459
(She even has to do the difficult dance moves.)

573
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,558
Is it done?

574
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,528
It's a song with powerful dance performances.

575
00:28:49,529 --> 00:28:51,900
So it could be dangerous...

576
00:28:52,239 --> 00:28:55,099
if I can't pull it off physically.

577
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:58,008
- What do we do? - I didn't warm up at all.

578
00:28:58,009 --> 00:28:59,039
(It's time for physical training.)

579
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:01,008
My body is stiff.

580
00:29:01,009 --> 00:29:02,748
I bruised my knees.

581
00:29:02,749 --> 00:29:04,309
- Why? - While dancing.

582
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,650
I got bruises on both my knees.

583
00:29:08,019 --> 00:29:10,120
Does anyone have back pain?

584
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,989
- I have a bad back. - What's the problem?

585
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,588
The tailbone hurts.

586
00:29:15,589 --> 00:29:16,629
It hurts.

587
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,289
Lean forward.

588
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:20,659
Put your arms forward.

589
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,699
(This isn't easy.)

590
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:24,169
Stretch out the fourth finger.

591
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:25,269
Inhale.

592
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:27,238
Exhale as you raise your arms.

593
00:29:27,239 --> 00:29:28,910
(She pulls herself together and focuses again.)

594
00:29:29,239 --> 00:29:30,370
One more time.

595
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,508
- Stop falling like that. - Inhale. Goodness.

596
00:29:32,509 --> 00:29:34,039
Exhale as you raise your arms.

597
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:35,579
Stay still. One,

598
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:38,009
two, three.

599
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,450
Good.

600
00:29:39,451 --> 00:29:40,849
(They need the physical training to practice the dance safely.)

601
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,318
Next.

602
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:44,519
Am I supposed to sweat like this?

603
00:29:45,489 --> 00:29:47,920
(Now, they go back to practice the dance.)

604
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:51,288
One, two, three, four, five.

605
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,129
One, two, three...

606
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:55,798
(They keep practicing to give the perfect performance.)

607
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:56,998
This is where I turn and...

608
00:29:56,999 --> 00:29:58,399
(Falling)

609
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,400
Hang on.

610
00:29:59,401 --> 00:30:00,699
(Her legs gave way.)

611
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,238
- You can do this. - You got this.

612
00:30:02,239 --> 00:30:03,439
All right.

613
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,710
I put a cross while writing down your name

614
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:09,109
I'm still not good enough,

615
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:11,179
so I have to practice a lot...

616
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,049
not to cause trouble to my team.

617
00:30:15,019 --> 00:30:18,189
(She also practices singing hard.)

618
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:19,219
I just leave you

619
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,160
Turning around

620
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:22,559
Here.

621
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:25,359
(They are all busy practicing.)

622
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,699
(But Gehlee Dangca is just standing still.)

623
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,130
It was difficult.

624
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:32,538
When we learn a new dance step, it takes me...

625
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:37,008
a little bit of time... A little bit more time to master...

626
00:30:37,009 --> 00:30:40,980
because dancing is still an entirely new experience for me.

627
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:44,450
I've always... Like all my life, I've only focused on singing.

628
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:46,348
I'm sort of a beginner in dancing.

629
00:30:46,349 --> 00:30:47,848
And three, four.

630
00:30:47,849 --> 00:30:51,548
And five and six and seven, eight.

631
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:54,190
And stop, two, three, four.

632
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,960
Four, five, six.

633
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:58,930
That's it.

634
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:03,430
I'm a little worried about Gehlee Dangca.

635
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:05,439
She still has a lot to work on,

636
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,738
so we can't let her perform on stage just like this.

637
00:31:08,739 --> 00:31:11,309
If we perform like this, we will definitely lose.

638
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,409
I feel a little bit sorry...

639
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:16,078
that sometimes they have to...

640
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:18,919
During my part, they had to repeat their dance moves.

641
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,920
But...

642
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:22,519
I really try.

643
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,989
Good.

644
00:31:26,059 --> 00:31:28,159
But, Gehlee, watch.

645
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:31,890
(Narumi goes to Gehlee Dangca and teaches her the moves.)

646
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:36,930
Yes.

647
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,169
(When she's struggling alone, )

648
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:43,569
(Narumi shows up.)

649
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:47,509
(Leader Narumi checks her dance moves thoroughly.)

650
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:51,209
Gehlee Dangca is doing things that she has never experienced...

651
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:53,319
all by herself here.

652
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:57,249
I understand how she feels,

653
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:00,359
so I wanted to help her.

654
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:03,328
So I'm helping her a lot.

655
00:32:03,329 --> 00:32:04,589
That's it. Good.

656
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:09,469
I'm really appreciative and grateful for them...

657
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:12,739
because they take the time to like... They're patient with me.

658
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:16,410
What that did to me was... It inspired me..

659
00:32:16,569 --> 00:32:19,880
to work to be as good as they are.

660
00:32:20,509 --> 00:32:23,379
And it's crazy to think that...

661
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,920
I could get as good as they are.

662
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:29,088
It sounds insane.

663
00:32:29,089 --> 00:32:30,549
But why not?

664
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:32,789
I feel like I'm capable of doing it.

665
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:37,460
(Will Gehlee Dangca be able to overcome the barrier?)

666
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:43,199
All right. Team Bulldozer, please show your performance.

667
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,200
Okay.

668
00:32:44,201 --> 00:32:45,598
Don't be intimidated.

669
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:46,639
Two and three.

670
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,539
- Let's go, "Nan!" - Let's go, "Nan!"

671
00:32:49,239 --> 00:32:51,209
- Let's go! - You got this!

672
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:52,278
- You can do it! - Good luck!

673
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:53,779
- Go for it! - Go for it!

674
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:57,008
- Goodness, look at their bodies. - Narumi...

675
00:32:57,009 --> 00:32:58,848
- Look at Narumi. - They're the bomb.

676
00:32:58,849 --> 00:33:01,380
- Good luck! - Good luck!

677
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:06,058
- Gosh. - What?

678
00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:07,719
(Kwon Eunhyung)

679
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,929
(Narumi)

680
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:10,058
(Yona)

681
00:33:10,059 --> 00:33:11,129
(Heo Sunbin)

682
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:12,328
(Idota Yui)

683
00:33:12,329 --> 00:33:14,259
(Gehlee Dangca)

684
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:17,829
("Nan" by Kwon Eunhyung, Narumi, )

685
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:18,899
(Yona, Idota Yui, Gehlee Dangca, Heo Sunbin)

686
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,940
(Arranged by: team VENDORS, EL CAPITXN)

687
00:33:32,049 --> 00:33:33,420
Is this really "Nan?"

688
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,390
How pretty.

689
00:34:06,619 --> 00:34:07,920
Narumi is gorgeous.

690
00:34:15,789 --> 00:34:18,090
- Gosh. - Gehlee's cool.

691
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:57,929
Yes!

692
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,909
Yes!

693
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,590
Yes!

694
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:24,190
My gosh.

695
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,869
Gehlee is on fire.

696
00:36:15,909 --> 00:36:17,879
(They killed it!)

697
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,849
- That was great. - They killed it.

698
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:22,388
- That team killed it. - They were amazing.

699
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:23,589
They were so cool.

700
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:25,989
- Did you see Gehlee? - They were terrific.

701
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:28,319
- That move was unbelievable. - What?

702
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,530
That is the low team?

703
00:36:29,929 --> 00:36:32,599
- Okay. - Goodness.

704
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,268
Great job.

705
00:36:38,269 --> 00:36:40,300
- Thank you. - Gosh.

706
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,309
- My gosh. - Really.

707
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:45,308
First off, the arrangement was superb.

708
00:36:45,309 --> 00:36:47,538
- I agree. - Yes.

709
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:49,249
- Thank you. - Seriously.

710
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:52,380
I can't dare to evaluate it.

711
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:54,249
But here's what I was grateful about.

712
00:36:54,349 --> 00:36:56,748
You hid the participants' weaknesses well.

713
00:36:56,749 --> 00:36:58,419
- Yes. - And you brought out...

714
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,260
what they were good at.

715
00:37:00,889 --> 00:37:03,530
You pointed out which parts to sing,

716
00:37:03,929 --> 00:37:07,599
which made their strengths stand out.

717
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,169
Compared to the other teams, the charms of...

718
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:12,300
each of the participants popped out.

719
00:37:12,469 --> 00:37:13,999
I can't believe this is the low team.

720
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:15,539
The performance was great.

721
00:37:15,909 --> 00:37:17,339
- Thank you. - Thank you.

722
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,039
Really, they did an awesome job.

723
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:23,808
I was able to tell that Narumi...

724
00:37:23,809 --> 00:37:27,748
understood the beat, rhythm, and vibe of this song...

725
00:37:27,749 --> 00:37:29,819
the most...

726
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:32,659
and tried to portray that in this performance.

727
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:35,959
Your dance, singing, and facial expressions...

728
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:39,730
had this charm that wouldn't let me take my eyes off you.

729
00:37:39,929 --> 00:37:43,569
I would like to praise you for keeping the balance...

730
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:44,998
of this team.

731
00:37:44,999 --> 00:37:46,740
Thank you.

732
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:51,069
- And Dangca. - Yes?

733
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:52,939
There were many parts where I was surprised...

734
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:55,009
to hear a different voice from you.

735
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:59,078
Honestly, I wasn't sure if this song would suit you.

736
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:02,749
But vocal-wise, yours suited this song the most.

737
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:04,749
Great work on that part.

738
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,658
Your singing was good,

739
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:10,690
but I could see that you practiced the moves a lot.

740
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:14,230
I want to compliment you on how much you improved. Good job.

741
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:18,199
And Eunhyung...

742
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:21,240
Right? Were you always this good?

743
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:22,808
You improved so much.

744
00:38:22,809 --> 00:38:24,369
- Thank you. - Were you hiding it?

745
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:26,779
I was shocked.

746
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,980
In my memories, you were...

747
00:38:29,449 --> 00:38:33,419
And my apologies for saying this, but I never thought you were good.

748
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:36,089
You were full of charms,

749
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:38,718
but if only you could improve even by a bit,

750
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:42,960
you had great potential. That was what I thought.

751
00:38:43,289 --> 00:38:45,559
But on today's stage,

752
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,730
my eyes were set on you from the beginning.

753
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:53,299
- Thank you. - Oh, my.

754
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,368
I'm proud of you.

755
00:38:55,369 --> 00:38:56,939
Everyone did a great job.

756
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:00,009
I was going to remind myself this was a low team performance.

757
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:03,479
But you were good to the point I didn't have to.

758
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,349
You all pulled it off really well.

759
00:39:05,449 --> 00:39:08,078
I'm so glad that the Unicorns said...

760
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,089
the same thing I did during the recording,

761
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:12,759
"Why are you the low rank?"

762
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,589
Every one of you did great.

763
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:15,928
- Totally. - You were the best.

764
00:39:15,929 --> 00:39:17,530
- Thank you. - Thank you.

765
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:23,368
Gehlee Dangca was a totally different person.

766
00:39:23,369 --> 00:39:25,300
Why is everyone so good?

767
00:39:25,999 --> 00:39:27,399
- Her range was... - Yes.

768
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,638
She was easy on the ear.

769
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:29,808
- Yes. - It was pleasant.

770
00:39:29,809 --> 00:39:31,709
This level is easy to decide, right?

771
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:33,038
Yes, very easy.

772
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:35,138
- Is everyone on the same page? - Yes.

773
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:36,780
- I'm done. - Good.

774
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:41,079
(Which team will get the chance to get promoted?)

775
00:39:41,249 --> 00:39:42,280
Good job.

776
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:52,289
We will now announce the result of Level Station.

777
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:55,329
Four will get eliminated from the losing team.

778
00:39:55,869 --> 00:39:56,968
What? "Four?"

779
00:39:56,969 --> 00:39:58,170
(4 are eliminated from the losing team.)

780
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:04,039
The winner of the Low Rank Battle is...

781
00:40:04,409 --> 00:40:06,710
(Team Volcano)

782
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:09,579
(Team Bulldozer)

783
00:40:14,219 --> 00:40:15,519
Team Bulldozer.

784
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:18,649
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

785
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,090
(Team Bulldozer won.)

786
00:40:20,289 --> 00:40:23,360
(2 will get promoted from the winning team.)

787
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:29,099
(4 will get eliminated from the losing team.)

788
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:34,400
Team "Nan" did great.

789
00:40:34,769 --> 00:40:36,409
I didn't think they were low.

790
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:38,409
They killed it.

791
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:42,510
We will announce the promoted...

792
00:40:42,949 --> 00:40:45,949
low rank members from the Unicorn Ticketing.

793
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,449
Are two getting promoted?

794
00:40:50,219 --> 00:40:51,719
There are only a few in this team.

795
00:40:52,389 --> 00:40:55,929
The two to get promoted from the low rank are...

796
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:03,329
(All members of Team Bulldozer showed improvement.)

797
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:07,240
(Which member will get promoted?)

798
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,409
The two promoted members are...

799
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:13,209
Narumi.

800
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:15,340
Yes. Thank you.

801
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:17,150
And...

802
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:19,848
(Who is the last to be promoted from the low rank?)

803
00:41:19,849 --> 00:41:21,550
I did have my hopes up a bit.

804
00:41:23,249 --> 00:41:24,490
Gehlee Dangca.

805
00:41:24,749 --> 00:41:26,658
- Thank you. - Congratulations.

806
00:41:26,659 --> 00:41:28,219
(The fifth promoted member, Gehlee Dangca)

807
00:41:29,219 --> 00:41:31,259
(Members not promoted or eliminated...)

808
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:33,659
(by Unicorn Ticketing can get promoted by Fan Ticketing.)

809
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,730
- Narumi was really cool. - Totally.

810
00:41:36,329 --> 00:41:37,400
That was crazy.

811
00:41:38,499 --> 00:41:41,440
We will now announce the eliminated members of the low rank.

812
00:41:42,769 --> 00:41:44,940
(Team Volcano walks heavily onto the stage.)

813
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:53,078
They all look down. It's breaking my heart.

814
00:41:53,079 --> 00:41:54,219
Right?

815
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:57,590
(4 out of the 6 members will get eliminated.)

816
00:41:57,949 --> 00:41:59,788
How can they eliminate four of them?

817
00:41:59,789 --> 00:42:01,690
- They must be nervous. - Even within the low rank...

818
00:42:01,789 --> 00:42:03,530
Everyone is getting eliminated.

819
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:05,360
- It's over half of them. - Four members.

820
00:42:09,699 --> 00:42:10,730
Now then,

821
00:42:10,869 --> 00:42:13,300
the four eliminated members of the losing team are...

822
00:42:13,469 --> 00:42:20,710
(Who are the 4 eliminated members of the losing team?)

823
00:42:20,909 --> 00:42:22,179
Oh, no.

824
00:42:22,579 --> 00:42:24,210
I feel bad for the four members.

825
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:27,150
The four eliminated members are...

826
00:42:28,179 --> 00:42:29,420
Aya Natsumi.

827
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:32,448
(The fourth eliminated member, Aya Natsumi)

828
00:42:32,449 --> 00:42:33,518
Riel.

829
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:34,889
(The fifth eliminated member, Riel)

830
00:42:37,329 --> 00:42:38,329
Vanesya.

831
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:40,099
(The sixth eliminated member, Vanesya)

832
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:42,460
So many are getting eliminated from this team.

833
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,099
Park Yewon.

834
00:42:50,039 --> 00:42:51,539
(The seventh eliminated member, Park Yewon)

835
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:53,179
Thank you for your hard work.

836
00:42:53,309 --> 00:42:55,039
- Thank you. - Thank you.

837
00:43:01,449 --> 00:43:04,150
You can't always get good feedback.

838
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:06,959
But you should at least be on your own side...

839
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,659
no matter what people say.

840
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:12,189
Yes. Some people placed you in the low rank.

841
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:15,129
If you keep living your life with that sense of defeat,

842
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:17,029
you won't be able to challenge yourself to other things.

843
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:19,538
That's universal regardless of the industries.

844
00:43:19,539 --> 00:43:21,968
With that being said, if you are crying today,

845
00:43:21,969 --> 00:43:24,409
I hope those are tears of anger, not self-pity.

846
00:43:24,809 --> 00:43:29,448
I hope you will be able to seize good opportunities.

847
00:43:29,449 --> 00:43:30,480
Good luck.

848
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:32,050
- Thank you. - Thank you.

849
00:43:34,749 --> 00:43:36,019
Well done.

850
00:43:39,019 --> 00:43:42,119
The two teams in the high rank remain to perform now.

851
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:44,460
Please come on up to the stage.

852
00:43:45,829 --> 00:43:47,099
I can't wait.

853
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:49,059
We'll watch the teams in the high rank at last.

854
00:43:49,099 --> 00:43:51,230
I can't wait to watch their performance.

855
00:43:51,269 --> 00:43:52,468
(Universe Ticket)

856
00:43:52,469 --> 00:43:54,240
Yes.

857
00:43:58,809 --> 00:44:01,110
- Hello. - Hello.

858
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:03,709
- Hello. - Hello.

859
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:05,049
(The last match of the Level Station)

860
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:07,280
I tell myself not to look forward to their performances.

861
00:44:07,449 --> 00:44:09,119
But when I look at their faces one at a time...

862
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,990
- Gosh. - All of them are good.

863
00:44:12,519 --> 00:44:14,459
It must be because you're all in the high rank.

864
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:17,960
Seeing each of your faces makes me feel how talented this group is.

865
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:19,530
Teams in the high rank.

866
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:21,498
Can you introduce yourselves?

867
00:44:21,499 --> 00:44:22,530
- Sure. - Yes.

868
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:24,269
Honk, honk.

869
00:44:24,469 --> 00:44:27,069
- Highway to Universe. - Highway to Universe.

870
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:31,039
- Hello. We're Team Highway. - Hello. We're Team Highway.

871
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:34,880
Team Highway.

872
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:36,349
They want to go straight to the top.

873
00:44:37,949 --> 00:44:40,820
From what I know, people in our team...

874
00:44:40,949 --> 00:44:44,320
are confident at dancing.

875
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:47,960
As this is a team in the high rank, everyone is so good.

876
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:51,659
So their dancing is very powerful.

877
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:54,300
Their performances are quite stable.

878
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,299
I thought we'd be able to crush this.

879
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:58,999
We'll win no matter what.

880
00:44:59,499 --> 00:45:00,740
I can't wait.

881
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:03,209
"WHATEVA!"

882
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:05,839
- Forever. Whenever. Yes! - Forever. Whenever. Yes!

883
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,240
Hello. We are...

884
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,440
- Team Forever. - Team Forever.

885
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:16,218
All of them are very good singers.

886
00:45:16,219 --> 00:45:18,050
I'm a good vocalist.

887
00:45:18,349 --> 00:45:20,190
I'm very confident.

888
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:24,990
(Elisia is a powerful vocalist like a pop star.)

889
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:27,699
- How is she so good? - Isn't she really good?

890
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:34,300
(Lim Seowon is a clean vocalist with a pure style.)

891
00:45:34,469 --> 00:45:37,340
I think I'm the best vocalist.

892
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:40,509
Given each individual's talent, our team is stronger.

893
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:42,010
We have much better skills.

894
00:45:42,409 --> 00:45:43,849
None of them...

895
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:45,078
- deserve to be eliminated. - Gosh.

896
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:46,880
- Gosh. - Oh, no.

897
00:45:47,179 --> 00:45:49,618
- They're in the high rank. - Won't they have the most pressure?

898
00:45:49,619 --> 00:45:50,619
- Exactly. - Yes.

899
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:53,419
(Performers versus vocalists)

900
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:54,619
Their vibes are so different.

901
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:58,460
I was told that you would be performing new songs.

902
00:45:58,490 --> 00:46:01,699
(The benefit of the teams in the high rank, new songs)

903
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:05,369
- Hello. - Hello.

904
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:06,768
(The contestants meet the producers for the new songs.)

905
00:46:06,769 --> 00:46:08,638
- Hello. - Hello.

906
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:09,768
- Hello. - Hello.

907
00:46:09,769 --> 00:46:14,539
- Hello. - Hello.

908
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:18,480
We have a special benefit for the teams in the high rank.

909
00:46:19,719 --> 00:46:22,050
For your benefit, a new song will be released...

910
00:46:22,619 --> 00:46:24,189
under your own names.

911
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:25,788
(They will get to release a new song under their names.)

912
00:46:25,789 --> 00:46:26,860
- Wait. - No way.

913
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,619
- Wait. - This is crazy.

914
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:29,829
Really?

915
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:32,659
I'll release a new song as an idol singer.

916
00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:33,829
I'm over the moon.

917
00:46:34,699 --> 00:46:35,999
I was elated.

918
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:37,599
I was really honored. Yes.

919
00:46:37,969 --> 00:46:40,498
Part of me felt a sense of pressure too.

920
00:46:40,499 --> 00:46:43,210
It made me think that I ought to do well no matter what.

921
00:46:43,869 --> 00:46:46,380
As for the song we prepared,

922
00:46:46,610 --> 00:46:47,979
it's called "WHATEVA."

923
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:48,980
- "WHATEVA." - "WHATEVA."

924
00:46:48,981 --> 00:46:50,379
As for this song,

925
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:52,879
we wanted it to sound like a debut song...

926
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,420
because, in a way, you practically debuted.

927
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:58,749
You guys are practically debuting with this performance.

928
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:01,518
We prepared this song for you,

929
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:03,629
so you guys could show off a lot of your charms...

930
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:06,189
and be bold too. Why don't we listen to it together?

931
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:08,030
- Sure. - Sounds good.

932
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:09,598
I'd like that.

933
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:15,440
(Listening to their new song for the first time)

934
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:25,809
The teen-crush kind of vibe stood out first.

935
00:47:28,349 --> 00:47:31,420
- We have a lot of good vocalists. - Right.

936
00:47:34,119 --> 00:47:36,360
I love it.

937
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:40,629
- We have it in the bag. - We have it in the bag.

938
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:42,300
- This is a great song. - It's great.

939
00:47:42,329 --> 00:47:43,900
It was the perfect song.

940
00:47:44,099 --> 00:47:46,499
This is totally my kind of song.

941
00:47:46,599 --> 00:47:48,840
It's like my song.

942
00:47:49,070 --> 00:47:50,070
What do you think?

943
00:47:50,071 --> 00:47:51,169
- You can do well, right? - I love it.

944
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:53,309
- Yes. - It's such a great song.

945
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:54,839
- I don't have to talk more, right? - Right!

946
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:57,209
- You got this. - We got this!

947
00:47:57,210 --> 00:47:58,679
(They already feel victorious.)

948
00:48:00,349 --> 00:48:02,719
Okay. Let me tell you about the new song we wrote.

949
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:05,948
With this song, you can show off your irresistible charm.

950
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:07,389
- Irresistible? - Irresistible?

951
00:48:07,889 --> 00:48:10,929
Every part of the song is a highlight.

952
00:48:11,559 --> 00:48:13,460
We didn't make it suitable for your debut.

953
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:15,629
We wrote the song as if it was for...

954
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:17,098
- For top girl groups. - Yes.

955
00:48:17,099 --> 00:48:19,268
We wrote a song a top girl group could perform too.

956
00:48:19,269 --> 00:48:21,269
- We already debuted. - That was our intention.

957
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,510
That's our song for you. It's called "Rush Hour."

958
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:26,109
- Let's listen to it. - Okay.

959
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:30,610
(A new song by PAPERMAKER, "Rush Hour")

960
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:40,058
This is so cool.

961
00:48:40,059 --> 00:48:41,190
I love it.

962
00:48:42,159 --> 00:48:44,828
The song suited our image perfectly.

963
00:48:44,829 --> 00:48:46,029
Given the style of the song,

964
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:47,998
we'll be able to stand out with our performance.

965
00:48:47,999 --> 00:48:49,299
I really liked the song.

966
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:50,670
I was really happy with the song.

967
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:52,998
- I love it. - It's so nice.

968
00:48:52,999 --> 00:48:54,170
- This is amazing. - We got this.

969
00:48:54,570 --> 00:48:56,300
- This is a great song. - What a great song.

970
00:48:56,369 --> 00:48:57,909
- We already crushed it. - This is so good.

971
00:48:58,139 --> 00:49:00,440
- What do you think? - We love it.

972
00:49:00,679 --> 00:49:02,138
- I don't have to talk more, right? - Right!

973
00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:04,249
- You got this. - We got this!

974
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:11,320
They are so cute!

975
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:12,889
This place is huge.

976
00:49:13,559 --> 00:49:15,658
- Team "Rush Hour." - Team "Rush Hour."

977
00:49:15,659 --> 00:49:16,860
- Come here. - Come over there.

978
00:49:16,929 --> 00:49:19,288
- Where are you guys? - Team "WHATEVA."

979
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:20,359
Team "WHATEVA."

980
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:23,129
- We should all wear this. - This fits me.

981
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:24,498
How about this for our pants?

982
00:49:24,499 --> 00:49:25,499
- I like it. - Do you like it?

983
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,498
- We'll look cute with jackets. - Yes, the padded jackets.

984
00:49:27,499 --> 00:49:28,599
- Yes. - Right?

985
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:31,308
This kind of padded jacket is popular these days.

986
00:49:31,309 --> 00:49:32,768
- Like this one. - Yes.

987
00:49:32,769 --> 00:49:34,579
- This looks really comfortable. - A short jacket.

988
00:49:35,409 --> 00:49:36,780
This is so cute.

989
00:49:36,909 --> 00:49:38,509
It will definitely keep me warm.

990
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:39,710
- I bet it's light too. - It is.

991
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,519
This will look great as our practice outfit.

992
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:44,519
Don't you think this will look great as a regular outfit too?

993
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:51,460
(Green and blue are theme colors for Team Highway.)

994
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:57,130
(Black and red are the theme colors for Team Forever.)

995
00:49:57,269 --> 00:50:00,639
(Both teams are done shopping for their outfits.)

996
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:03,670
(The last benefit of the teams in the high rank)

997
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:07,510
(It's time to enjoy sweet desserts for their hard work.)

998
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:09,880
- How am I supposed to eat this? - Really?

999
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:11,110
How is it?

1000
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:14,320
- It's so good. - Yes.

1001
00:50:15,219 --> 00:50:17,420
As the special benefit of being in the high rank,

1002
00:50:17,490 --> 00:50:18,848
we got to wear pretty clothes...

1003
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,518
- Yes. - and have delicious donuts.

1004
00:50:20,519 --> 00:50:22,089
Isn't it nice to be in the high rank?

1005
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:24,289
- It's so nice. - It's great.

1006
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:27,230
- Being in the high rank... - Because we're in the high rank,

1007
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:29,698
other girls in the average and low ranks will be watching us.

1008
00:50:29,699 --> 00:50:32,129
- Right. - We have to show them...

1009
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:33,468
- a good performance. - Right.

1010
00:50:33,469 --> 00:50:34,799
- The pride of being at the top. - Yes.

1011
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,369
- Let's keep our pride. - We have our pride.

1012
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:38,869
- Let's make legendary performances. - Yes.

1013
00:50:38,909 --> 00:50:40,039
- Yes. - Sounds good.

1014
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:45,050
(How will the teams in the high rank perform?)

1015
00:50:45,179 --> 00:50:46,779
Have you listened to each other's song?

1016
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:50,289
Compared to our song, their song lacked a punch.

1017
00:50:52,619 --> 00:50:53,860
That's one.

1018
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,018
But our song packs a punch.

1019
00:50:56,019 --> 00:50:57,829
It's also very catchy.

1020
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:01,059
I can't wait.

1021
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,828
If they think their song is catchy,

1022
00:51:03,829 --> 00:51:05,900
we'll be able to dominate them easily...

1023
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:08,769
with our talent, facial expressions,

1024
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,909
and energy. It will be an easy job.

1025
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:12,709
(It will be an easy job.)

1026
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:14,539
Gosh. Dominate.

1027
00:51:14,679 --> 00:51:16,139
Dominate.

1028
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:20,079
- She's so confident. - She's scary.

1029
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:23,349
(The competition is fierce even from the start.)

1030
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:27,519
We'll check out Team Highway's performance first.

1031
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,659
- Here we go. - Gosh.

1032
00:51:30,389 --> 00:51:31,590
I'm really looking forward to this.

1033
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,698
All right. Team Highway...

1034
00:51:36,699 --> 00:51:39,599
consists of contestants who advanced to this stage with our votes.

1035
00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:42,698
I bet the competition against one another within the team...

1036
00:51:42,699 --> 00:51:44,070
must have been intense too.

1037
00:51:44,210 --> 00:51:46,979
Be honest now. If your team were to win,

1038
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:49,038
who here thinks you would be the ones getting promoted?

1039
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:50,749
Raise your hands if that's what you think.

1040
00:51:52,349 --> 00:51:54,578
(Everyone expects themselves to be promoted.)

1041
00:51:54,579 --> 00:51:56,480
All of them. Nice.

1042
00:51:57,650 --> 00:51:58,990
I can't wait.

1043
00:52:01,559 --> 00:52:03,759
(Their first meeting after the formation of the team)

1044
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,990
- We're the best of the high rank. - Right.

1045
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:07,859
- Right. - The high rank.

1046
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:09,260
- Right. - We're in the high rank.

1047
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:13,570
(During the Unicorn Ticketing of the Battle Week)

1048
00:52:13,769 --> 00:52:15,070
Hwang Sieun.

1049
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:16,400
Thank you.

1050
00:52:16,469 --> 00:52:17,769
Bang Yunha.

1051
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:19,980
Thank you.

1052
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:21,579
Kim Sujin.

1053
00:52:21,610 --> 00:52:22,740
Thank you.

1054
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:27,219
(The members of this strong team advanced with Unicorns' votes.)

1055
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:30,349
I thought that I had to be promoted no matter what.

1056
00:52:30,449 --> 00:52:34,119
I want to advance to the top in one go.

1057
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:35,960
I don't believe that I will lose.

1058
00:52:36,289 --> 00:52:37,730
But I do believe that I will win.

1059
00:52:37,929 --> 00:52:40,999
I was told that you guys came here determined.

1060
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:42,698
- That's what we heard. - Right. That's what we heard.

1061
00:52:42,699 --> 00:52:43,829
You guys are determined.

1062
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:45,969
- Let's go. - All right.

1063
00:52:46,469 --> 00:52:48,840
- Let's start from the top. - Okay.

1064
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:01,519
I was born a maverick

1065
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:03,819
I don't want to be plain

1066
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:06,119
- She's good. - I'll show you what a savage is

1067
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:08,719
- Gosh. How is she this good? - Because I know I can make you mad

1068
00:53:10,030 --> 00:53:11,590
- Well done. Come on out. - Thank you.

1069
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,099
Gosh, I'm so nervous.

1070
00:53:14,829 --> 00:53:15,829
Don't be nervous.

1071
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:17,299
- Thank you. - Then it's hard to sing well.

1072
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:18,468
- Be confident. - Okay.

1073
00:53:18,469 --> 00:53:20,869
(Kim Sujin is applying to get the part with high notes.)

1074
00:53:25,539 --> 00:53:26,539
She's good.

1075
00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:36,419
No chaos can stop me

1076
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:37,819
- Her high notes are really good. - I doubt that...

1077
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:39,049
other girls can pull it off like her.

1078
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:42,260
Rush hour

1079
00:53:43,159 --> 00:53:45,029
- Lastly, Yunha. - I'll go in.

1080
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:46,489
- You got this. - Let's do this.

1081
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:48,099
- Yunha. - Good luck.

1082
00:53:51,170 --> 00:53:52,230
Hello.

1083
00:53:55,369 --> 00:53:58,110
(Yunha nervously warms up her voice.)

1084
00:53:59,409 --> 00:54:00,880
- All right. Are you ready? - Yes.

1085
00:54:01,309 --> 00:54:02,639
- We'll begin. - Okay.

1086
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:12,920
- Her voice is nice. - Right. It's not bad.

1087
00:54:14,119 --> 00:54:16,690
I've got to skip that rush hour

1088
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:22,098
(She gets the note wrong in the chorus.)

1089
00:54:22,099 --> 00:54:24,498
The lights I put up

1090
00:54:24,499 --> 00:54:27,800
Now, it's time to open up

1091
00:54:30,670 --> 00:54:34,879
(It seems she hasn't fully learned the song yet.)

1092
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:37,610
I've got to skip that rush hour

1093
00:54:39,249 --> 00:54:40,279
Thank you.

1094
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:43,119
(She finishes singing it with a sense of disappointment.)

1095
00:54:43,449 --> 00:54:44,550
- Yunha. - Yes.

1096
00:54:46,190 --> 00:54:48,089
You're good, but something is missing.

1097
00:54:48,090 --> 00:54:49,090
Okay.

1098
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:51,389
It's hard to describe it.

1099
00:54:52,389 --> 00:54:55,729
Maybe my expectations were too high because you were...

1100
00:54:55,730 --> 00:54:57,198
in the high rank.

1101
00:54:57,199 --> 00:55:00,030
(My expectations were too high because you were in the high rank.)

1102
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:02,868
I think you can do well.

1103
00:55:02,869 --> 00:55:05,610
That's why I'm a bit disappointed.

1104
00:55:05,909 --> 00:55:07,510
I know that you didn't have much time.

1105
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:08,779
Why are you crying?

1106
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:10,408
- What's wrong? - Why are you crying?

1107
00:55:10,409 --> 00:55:11,880
Why are you crying when I'm talking?

1108
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:13,949
I'm sorry.

1109
00:55:14,249 --> 00:55:15,280
No.

1110
00:55:15,449 --> 00:55:16,888
- Oh, no. - I'm sorry.

1111
00:55:16,889 --> 00:55:19,289
- They're taking turns to cry. - Right.

1112
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:21,218
- Don't cry. - Right. Why are you crying?

1113
00:55:21,219 --> 00:55:23,219
I couldn't remember the chorus.

1114
00:55:24,789 --> 00:55:27,159
- I did my best. - I'm sorry for making it hard.

1115
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:28,699
- No. - We're sorry.

1116
00:55:30,369 --> 00:55:31,868
You only had two days.

1117
00:55:31,869 --> 00:55:32,998
- Of course. - This is natural.

1118
00:55:32,999 --> 00:55:34,768
(She knows better than anyone that can't be an excuse.)

1119
00:55:34,769 --> 00:55:35,940
Nice try.

1120
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:38,039
I wanted to do well.

1121
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:41,280
They said it was a bit iffy.

1122
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:44,210
They said it was hard to describe it.

1123
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:47,179
I wasn't fully ready to sing the song.

1124
00:55:48,019 --> 00:55:50,619
I was upset at myself for that.

1125
00:55:51,249 --> 00:55:54,860
So I think that was when I got a sense of determination.

1126
00:55:55,059 --> 00:55:57,860
I wanted to perform my part perfectly no matter what.

1127
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:01,059
I've got to skip that rush hour

1128
00:56:01,099 --> 00:56:02,230
Yes

1129
00:56:02,329 --> 00:56:05,530
I wanted to make this highlight of the song mine.

1130
00:56:05,999 --> 00:56:07,739
It's nice. But it doesn't go like this, "rush."

1131
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:09,299
Rush hour

1132
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:11,138
(She tried to master every syllable and breath.)

1133
00:56:11,139 --> 00:56:12,268
- Just like that. - Okay

1134
00:56:12,269 --> 00:56:14,110
(She tried to master every syllable and breath.)

1135
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:18,710
I've got to skip that rush hour

1136
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:20,249
Yes

1137
00:56:20,349 --> 00:56:21,379
That's it.

1138
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:23,119
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1139
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,419
- Well done. - Thank you.

1140
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:27,388
- Ma'am. - Thank you.

1141
00:56:27,389 --> 00:56:29,719
- When I have to sing my part... - Yes.

1142
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:32,260
- Rush hour - I didn't do anything there.

1143
00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:33,998
So I was thinking...

1144
00:56:33,999 --> 00:56:35,300
Go ahead. It's fine.

1145
00:56:35,699 --> 00:56:37,828
- Is it better to do it? - It will be better if you do it.

1146
00:56:37,829 --> 00:56:40,669
I wanted to practice until people said I was perfect...

1147
00:56:40,670 --> 00:56:43,400
or until I got compliments like I was really good.

1148
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:46,440
It made me want to practice really hard.

1149
00:56:52,210 --> 00:56:55,078
(When Yunha is focused on her practice...)

1150
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:57,689
The nervousness runs through me intensely

1151
00:56:57,690 --> 00:56:59,849
Now I show

1152
00:57:00,619 --> 00:57:03,360
- I've got to skip that rush hour - Let me join you.

1153
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:06,429
Skip that rush hour

1154
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,829
Hey, not there.

1155
00:57:10,999 --> 00:57:14,039
- Hey, sorry. Let's try this. - This is funny.

1156
00:57:15,639 --> 00:57:17,510
- We should keep practicing. - Yes.

1157
00:57:18,670 --> 00:57:20,840
We're in the high rank.

1158
00:57:21,010 --> 00:57:23,609
We thought if we worked hard, we would pass.

1159
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:24,880
That's what I think.

1160
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:27,949
The busy gaze chasing

1161
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:29,618
- It's okay. - The nervousness

1162
00:57:29,619 --> 00:57:30,689
Runs through me intensely

1163
00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:32,718
- Can you try again? - The busy gaze chasing

1164
00:57:32,719 --> 00:57:34,218
(Soobin keeps missing the high notes.)

1165
00:57:34,219 --> 00:57:37,689
The parts I have have notes that are too high for my register.

1166
00:57:37,690 --> 00:57:40,760
It was hard, so I was really worried.

1167
00:57:41,429 --> 00:57:43,730
The busy gaze chasing

1168
00:57:44,369 --> 00:57:48,469
My live performance is really unstable.

1169
00:57:48,639 --> 00:57:51,969
If I keep practicing singing, my voice might go hoarse.

1170
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:54,309
Did you try that?

1171
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:59,178
(Sujin practices the high notes with her undivided attention.)

1172
00:57:59,179 --> 00:58:02,519
I thought I had to perform well as an individual too.

1173
00:58:02,679 --> 00:58:07,519
I thought I should be able to stand out a bit more during my part.

1174
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:13,429
(The lesson begins as they're concerned for their own reasons.)

1175
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:15,599
I'll show you what a savage is

1176
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:18,269
Because I know I can make you mad

1177
00:58:18,329 --> 00:58:20,840
See who's better

1178
00:58:22,170 --> 00:58:23,369
You're busy trying to pull off your part.

1179
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:26,109
- It sounds like... - Okay.

1180
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:28,440
you're performing alone as solo artists.

1181
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:31,479
In a way, it sounds as if...

1182
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:33,179
you're only interested in standing out as an individual.

1183
00:58:33,249 --> 00:58:35,248
It might come across as selfish.

1184
00:58:35,249 --> 00:58:37,888
So as a team, that might put you in a dangerous position.

1185
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:38,889
Okay.

1186
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:41,490
I think my team should try to be on alert...

1187
00:58:41,619 --> 00:58:45,489
and practice hard with a sense of crisis.

1188
00:58:45,490 --> 00:58:47,599
But they are way too complacent.

1189
00:58:48,059 --> 00:58:50,929
I don't feel as if we're trying our best together as a team.

1190
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:52,828
- Let's try it. - Okay.

1191
00:58:52,829 --> 00:58:54,138
- Let's start. - Okay.

1192
00:58:54,139 --> 00:58:57,539
(There aren't many matches left for them to feel complacent.)

1193
00:58:58,309 --> 00:59:00,110
I think I just noticed something.

1194
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:02,609
Some of us dance like this. Who's better

1195
00:59:02,610 --> 00:59:04,178
- Okay. - Who's better

1196
00:59:04,179 --> 00:59:05,349
Then some of us do this.

1197
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:06,610
Move, please.

1198
00:59:06,849 --> 00:59:08,919
Look. This is the center.

1199
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:12,819
We need this much space from the center.

1200
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:14,359
- Okay. Got it. - Okay?

1201
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:16,158
- Nizi. Sieun. Okay? - Okay.

1202
00:59:16,159 --> 00:59:19,359
I wanted to lead our team to victory...

1203
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:22,329
and I wanted us to do well. That's what crossed my mind.

1204
00:59:23,929 --> 00:59:25,369
- Look. - This is...

1205
00:59:26,369 --> 00:59:27,538
This part isn't in sync.

1206
00:59:27,539 --> 00:59:29,199
Everyone is lowering in a different order.

1207
00:59:30,039 --> 00:59:31,569
You stepped out a bit too much.

1208
00:59:31,570 --> 00:59:34,209
What was it? It was during Yuri's part.

1209
00:59:34,210 --> 00:59:37,248
She took the initiative and helped everyone.

1210
00:59:37,249 --> 00:59:41,348
She kept our team centered.

1211
00:59:41,349 --> 00:59:42,880
To be honest, at first,

1212
00:59:43,619 --> 00:59:45,149
our teamwork wasn't good.

1213
00:59:45,150 --> 00:59:48,788
When we sang the song live, things didn't work.

1214
00:59:48,789 --> 00:59:51,289
There were so many things that didn't work as a team.

1215
00:59:51,559 --> 00:59:53,590
I think we're growing now.

1216
00:59:54,829 --> 00:59:57,429
We had a lot of difficulties.

1217
00:59:57,670 --> 00:59:59,829
Right. We had way too many.

1218
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:01,598
- We must win first. - Yes.

1219
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:03,239
- Our team must win. - I'd like that.

1220
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:05,538
That way, at least four of us will be promoted.

1221
01:00:05,539 --> 01:00:06,569
Right.

1222
01:00:06,570 --> 01:00:11,609
The best strategy we have is winning.

1223
01:00:11,610 --> 01:00:12,879
- Winning is our priority. - We must win.

1224
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,348
- Let's win. - Sounds good.

1225
01:00:14,349 --> 01:00:17,348
Let's wrap this up after we say, "Rush Hour."

1226
01:00:17,349 --> 01:00:18,449
- Okay. - Sounds good.

1227
01:00:18,619 --> 01:00:19,789
In 2, 3.

1228
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:22,388
- Go for it, Team "Rush Hour." - Go for it, Team "Rush Hour."

1229
01:00:22,389 --> 01:00:23,658
- Bye. - Bye.

1230
01:00:23,659 --> 01:00:24,960
In 1, 2, 3.

1231
01:00:25,090 --> 01:00:26,158
- Let's win, Team "Rush Hour." - Let's win, Team "Rush Hour."

1232
01:00:26,159 --> 01:00:28,360
- We got this. - We got this.

1233
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:30,869
- Let's go. - Good luck.

1234
01:00:34,869 --> 01:00:36,739
- Do well. - Okay.

1235
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:37,809
You got this.

1236
01:00:38,210 --> 01:00:39,309
Go!

1237
01:00:55,490 --> 01:00:57,729
("Rush Hour" by Kim Soobin, Kim Sujin, Nizi, Bang Yunha, )

1238
01:00:57,730 --> 01:00:59,889
(Bae Yeram, Yuri, Hwang Sieun)

1239
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:25,679
Gosh, Nizi is really good.

1240
01:02:26,650 --> 01:02:28,079
They're so good! What?

1241
01:02:56,179 --> 01:02:57,210
Yes!

1242
01:03:09,219 --> 01:03:10,320
All right!

1243
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:13,888
- Gosh. - That was even better, right?

1244
01:04:13,889 --> 01:04:16,059
That was amazing.

1245
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:17,559
They were great.

1246
01:04:21,429 --> 01:04:22,499
Their expressions.

1247
01:04:22,999 --> 01:04:25,230
The looks in their eyes until the end.

1248
01:04:25,469 --> 01:04:26,599
That was insane.

1249
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:33,740
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1250
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:39,149
Gosh, this is why they're in the high rank group.

1251
01:04:39,150 --> 01:04:40,819
- They sure are different. - Right?

1252
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:42,349
They did an awesome job.

1253
01:04:46,590 --> 01:04:48,089
They did an awesome job.

1254
01:04:48,090 --> 01:04:50,490
I mean, they were amazing.

1255
01:04:50,590 --> 01:04:52,888
You guys were amazing.

1256
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:54,800
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1257
01:04:57,300 --> 01:05:01,468
That was the first performance that I actually had fun watching.

1258
01:05:01,469 --> 01:05:03,339
- That made me want to cheer. - Thank you.

1259
01:05:03,340 --> 01:05:04,740
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1260
01:05:05,309 --> 01:05:08,009
How should I put it? You were like an actual girl group.

1261
01:05:08,010 --> 01:05:09,710
- Yes. - Really.

1262
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:11,178
Terrific job.

1263
01:05:11,179 --> 01:05:12,710
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1264
01:05:14,619 --> 01:05:16,678
You had such good teamwork.

1265
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:18,690
From the intro, I thought, "This is insane."

1266
01:05:18,889 --> 01:05:20,919
"They're amazing. This is going to be legendary."

1267
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:22,589
That's all I could think about.

1268
01:05:22,590 --> 01:05:24,360
- Thank you. - Every time Yunha sang,

1269
01:05:24,789 --> 01:05:26,429
"La, la, la, la,"

1270
01:05:26,929 --> 01:05:30,929
she was just incredibly alluring.

1271
01:05:33,670 --> 01:05:38,139
(She caught everyone's eyes from the intro.)

1272
01:05:41,340 --> 01:05:43,839
In every group, I see one person who keeps...

1273
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:45,279
the group's balance,

1274
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:48,718
and I think it was Yunha in this group.

1275
01:05:48,719 --> 01:05:51,149
- Yes, she was great in the intro. - It was legendary.

1276
01:05:51,150 --> 01:05:54,118
Yunha recorded the song just 2 or 3 days...

1277
01:05:54,119 --> 01:05:56,788
after she was assigned to her part.

1278
01:05:56,789 --> 01:06:00,428
But in that short period of time, she had improved so much that...

1279
01:06:00,429 --> 01:06:02,098
I wondered how much she had practiced.

1280
01:06:02,099 --> 01:06:05,129
We gave her the highlight because she was already good,

1281
01:06:05,130 --> 01:06:07,399
but she pulled it off so well.

1282
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:09,268
Her performance made me proud.

1283
01:06:09,269 --> 01:06:10,809
Thank you.

1284
01:06:12,940 --> 01:06:16,440
Now, about Nizi.

1285
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:18,279
My goodness.

1286
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:20,078
- I mean, - She was incredible.

1287
01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:21,879
Nizi was only assigned...

1288
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:23,518
- Not a lot. - to two parts.

1289
01:06:23,519 --> 01:06:26,949
But it was enough for her to own the entire performance.

1290
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:32,360
(Although her part was short, she had incredible stage presence.)

1291
01:06:32,990 --> 01:06:35,698
Usually, it's the dance for the chorus that you remember.

1292
01:06:35,699 --> 01:06:37,098
But it was this move of Nizi's...

1293
01:06:37,099 --> 01:06:38,800
- that was stuck in my head. - I know, right?

1294
01:06:39,130 --> 01:06:41,099
It's like that was their iconic move.

1295
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:43,368
- Sujin. - Yes?

1296
01:06:43,369 --> 01:06:47,039
How are you so good at singing?

1297
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:49,239
- Thank you. - How? Were you always this good?

1298
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:51,510
- Seriously. - Thank you.

1299
01:06:51,749 --> 01:06:54,919
When people first learn how to sing,

1300
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:56,518
they usually...

1301
01:06:56,519 --> 01:06:59,788
tend to squeeze their voice when they sing high notes.

1302
01:06:59,789 --> 01:07:01,819
But Sujin, you're so young,

1303
01:07:01,820 --> 01:07:04,360
yet you hit those high notes with such great breath support.

1304
01:07:05,159 --> 01:07:08,698
(Her powerful singing of high notes was imposing.)

1305
01:07:08,699 --> 01:07:12,999
I'm so glad that you guys proved yourselves as the high rank group.

1306
01:07:13,630 --> 01:07:15,069
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1307
01:07:15,070 --> 01:07:16,070
You seem excited.

1308
01:07:18,869 --> 01:07:21,178
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1309
01:07:21,179 --> 01:07:24,110
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1310
01:07:28,050 --> 01:07:29,150
I'm relieved.

1311
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:31,719
They've raised my expectations.

1312
01:07:32,119 --> 01:07:33,990
- This puts a lot of pressure. - Exactly.

1313
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:35,619
We only have one team left.

1314
01:07:38,159 --> 01:07:41,260
They seemed a little overexcited onstage.

1315
01:07:41,499 --> 01:07:42,658
- Don't get overexcited. - Okay.

1316
01:07:42,659 --> 01:07:44,058
Let's just perform the way we've practiced...

1317
01:07:44,059 --> 01:07:45,098
- Yes. - and enjoy ourselves.

1318
01:07:45,099 --> 01:07:46,269
- Okay. - Okay.

1319
01:07:46,369 --> 01:07:49,240
Next up is Team Forever. Please come up onstage.

1320
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:54,339
- Hello. - Hello.

1321
01:07:54,340 --> 01:07:56,638
- Hello. - Hello.

1322
01:07:56,639 --> 01:07:59,079
(Friday and Chang of GALACTIKA)

1323
01:07:59,110 --> 01:08:01,179
- Adorable. - These guys look cute.

1324
01:08:01,519 --> 01:08:03,219
- They look beautiful. - Hello.

1325
01:08:07,659 --> 01:08:09,618
Did you watch your opposing team's performance?

1326
01:08:09,619 --> 01:08:10,690
- Yes. - Yes.

1327
01:08:11,059 --> 01:08:12,089
What did you think?

1328
01:08:12,090 --> 01:08:13,959
- They were good. - It was cool.

1329
01:08:14,230 --> 01:08:15,230
It was great.

1330
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:17,359
They don't seem intimidated at all.

1331
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:19,070
I like that.

1332
01:08:22,269 --> 01:08:24,208
Here's a question for the producers.

1333
01:08:24,209 --> 01:08:28,138
I heard you had a hard time deciding who should sing which part.

1334
01:08:28,139 --> 01:08:29,540
What made it so hard?

1335
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:33,249
I didn't really have high expectations for them,

1336
01:08:33,250 --> 01:08:35,949
but to my surprise, they were all so good.

1337
01:08:35,950 --> 01:08:37,619
I really regretted...

1338
01:08:37,620 --> 01:08:40,319
assigning them to their parts before meeting them.

1339
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:42,588
So I listened to them sing...

1340
01:08:42,589 --> 01:08:45,030
and reassigned the parts.

1341
01:08:45,230 --> 01:08:46,888
The recordings were satisfactory,

1342
01:08:46,889 --> 01:08:48,258
so I think it was the right decision.

1343
01:08:48,259 --> 01:08:49,530
I can't wait to hear it.

1344
01:08:52,570 --> 01:08:55,968
You're high rank, and I heard you competed hard for the main part.

1345
01:08:55,969 --> 01:08:57,639
So who got it?

1346
01:09:03,910 --> 01:09:07,008
(At GALACTIKA's recording studio)

1347
01:09:07,009 --> 01:09:09,048
- Hello. - Hello.

1348
01:09:09,049 --> 01:09:10,518
- Hello. - Hi, take a seat.

1349
01:09:10,519 --> 01:09:11,690
I like that you're all cheerful.

1350
01:09:12,019 --> 01:09:13,249
(They seem carefree.)

1351
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:14,489
Thank you.

1352
01:09:14,490 --> 01:09:15,559
You have a different level of energy.

1353
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:16,919
It's out of this world.

1354
01:09:17,419 --> 01:09:19,259
- You're full of confidence. - Great.

1355
01:09:19,530 --> 01:09:22,359
I want to be picked by the Unicorns,

1356
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:24,268
and I really want...

1357
01:09:24,269 --> 01:09:26,500
to do better than the others in the group.

1358
01:09:26,870 --> 01:09:29,570
I know how talented everyone is,

1359
01:09:29,799 --> 01:09:32,369
and everyone knows how talented I am.

1360
01:09:32,370 --> 01:09:34,809
I thought it was going to be an interesting competition.

1361
01:09:34,910 --> 01:09:37,650
Could you guys tell me if there is a certain part you want to do?

1362
01:09:37,879 --> 01:09:39,750
- I want to do part number 1. - Part number 1?

1363
01:09:39,910 --> 01:09:42,819
I want to do number 1 or number 3.

1364
01:09:42,820 --> 01:09:44,119
- Number 1 or 3? - Yes.

1365
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:46,088
- Elisia. - I want numbers 1, 2, or 3.

1366
01:09:46,089 --> 01:09:47,149
(Huran also wants part number 1.)

1367
01:09:47,150 --> 01:09:50,088
I want to do number 1 or 2.

1368
01:09:50,089 --> 01:09:52,459
I want to do numbers 1, 2, 3, or 7.

1369
01:09:52,530 --> 01:09:54,230
Okay. I like that you're ambitious.

1370
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:56,160
- You'll just have to do well. - Yes.

1371
01:09:56,230 --> 01:10:02,700
(They can showcase their powerful singing voice with part number 1.)

1372
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:04,369
Everyone wants to be the main vocalist.

1373
01:10:04,370 --> 01:10:05,909
- It's competitive. - Well,

1374
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:08,280
it looks like you all want it because you want to stand out.

1375
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:10,878
- You want the spotlight. - That'd be good.

1376
01:10:10,879 --> 01:10:13,480
You're right. That's the right kind of ambition.

1377
01:10:13,750 --> 01:10:15,449
I want part number one.

1378
01:10:15,450 --> 01:10:19,249
When it comes to singing, I think I'm better than everyone.

1379
01:10:19,250 --> 01:10:20,719
I'm confident I'll do well.

1380
01:10:21,019 --> 01:10:23,989
As long as I pull it off, I think I'll be able to stand out.

1381
01:10:23,990 --> 01:10:27,389
I think I'm the best singer in the group.

1382
01:10:27,660 --> 01:10:29,129
I'd like it to be me.

1383
01:10:30,299 --> 01:10:32,329
But you need to have the skills for it.

1384
01:10:32,330 --> 01:10:33,469
- Yes. - Right.

1385
01:10:33,769 --> 01:10:35,838
Let's see what you've got, shall we?

1386
01:10:35,839 --> 01:10:37,070
- Yes. - Okay.

1387
01:10:37,370 --> 01:10:40,969
(Jin Hyeonju gives it a go first.)

1388
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:48,579
The notes are not that high for you, right?

1389
01:10:48,580 --> 01:10:49,580
Right.

1390
01:10:49,581 --> 01:10:52,150
In that case, since you're the high rank group,

1391
01:10:52,690 --> 01:10:54,389
- why don't we raise the key? - Sorry?

1392
01:10:55,690 --> 01:10:56,918
(Surprised)

1393
01:10:56,919 --> 01:10:58,628
- The key? - Yes, I think you can do it.

1394
01:10:58,629 --> 01:10:59,829
I think so too.

1395
01:10:59,830 --> 01:11:01,500
(They're fazed by the unexpected change.)

1396
01:11:01,959 --> 01:11:04,099
(Practicing in the spare moment)

1397
01:11:04,769 --> 01:11:07,399
- Raise the key? - It won't be much different.

1398
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:09,240
- Let's try it. - Okay.

1399
01:11:09,639 --> 01:11:13,138
(Candidate number 1, Jin Hyeonju)

1400
01:11:13,139 --> 01:11:15,410
Okay, good.

1401
01:11:15,709 --> 01:11:17,240
That was nearly perfect.

1402
01:11:17,540 --> 01:11:19,009
- You can come out now. - Thank you.

1403
01:11:19,980 --> 01:11:25,549
(Candidate number 2, Lee Huran)

1404
01:11:28,219 --> 01:11:33,888
(Candidate number 3, Lee Eunchae)

1405
01:11:33,889 --> 01:11:35,699
- Okay. - Thank you.

1406
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:37,128
Great job. You sounded steady.

1407
01:11:37,129 --> 01:11:39,629
I can see why they're the high rank group.

1408
01:11:40,230 --> 01:11:42,569
I think they can all do a solid job.

1409
01:11:42,570 --> 01:11:44,269
(The competition for the main vocalist role is fierce.)

1410
01:11:44,469 --> 01:11:45,708
Good luck!

1411
01:11:45,709 --> 01:11:48,480
- Thank you. - Good luck!

1412
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:52,110
(Nervous)

1413
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:53,479
I have high expectations for her.

1414
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:54,949
Especially her, right?

1415
01:11:54,950 --> 01:11:56,879
Yes, she seemed very confident onstage.

1416
01:11:57,150 --> 01:11:59,149
I saw the fancam video. She seemed confident.

1417
01:11:59,150 --> 01:12:00,450
Like a real artist.

1418
01:12:03,519 --> 01:12:05,529
I think Elisia is good.

1419
01:12:05,530 --> 01:12:07,629
I'm a little intimidated by her.

1420
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:13,030
(Candidate number 4, Elisia)

1421
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:25,209
(That's amazing.)

1422
01:12:25,309 --> 01:12:26,780
She's an all-rounder.

1423
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:28,079
- That was incredible. - How should I put it?

1424
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:29,849
She's good at both rapping and singing.

1425
01:12:29,950 --> 01:12:31,518
- Not at all. - That was awesome.

1426
01:12:31,519 --> 01:12:32,849
Thank you.

1427
01:12:33,620 --> 01:12:35,190
Where did you find someone like her?

1428
01:12:36,519 --> 01:12:38,629
She did a great job singing the high notes,

1429
01:12:38,790 --> 01:12:40,758
and I was really nervous.

1430
01:12:40,759 --> 01:12:44,200
I think that my voice matches the song.

1431
01:12:44,259 --> 01:12:45,830
I feel very confident.

1432
01:12:47,230 --> 01:12:50,539
(Elisia is applauded by everyone for her great job.)

1433
01:12:50,540 --> 01:12:52,539
- Nicely done. - Thank you.

1434
01:12:52,540 --> 01:12:55,740
- We've got Elisia, so we'll win. - I know. Elisia is the best.

1435
01:12:55,839 --> 01:12:57,410
- Terrific job. - You did a great job!

1436
01:12:57,639 --> 01:12:59,509
Yes, you were amazing in there.

1437
01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:01,249
- Next, Seowon. Let's give it a try. - How cute.

1438
01:13:01,250 --> 01:13:03,650
Okay. Can I hear the key once?

1439
01:13:04,250 --> 01:13:07,718
I'm going to do whatever I want

1440
01:13:07,719 --> 01:13:09,120
Oh, yes

1441
01:13:09,660 --> 01:13:10,889
Oh, yes

1442
01:13:11,959 --> 01:13:15,558
I'm going to do whatever I want

1443
01:13:15,559 --> 01:13:17,030
Oh, yes

1444
01:13:17,459 --> 01:13:19,700
All right, let's start. Try to relax.

1445
01:13:19,870 --> 01:13:23,768
(Candidate number 5, Lim Seowon)

1446
01:13:23,769 --> 01:13:27,439
I'm going to do whatever I want

1447
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:30,110
(Candidate number 5, Lim Seowon)

1448
01:13:33,410 --> 01:13:34,549
Okay.

1449
01:13:35,519 --> 01:13:36,718
- Good job. - Thank you.

1450
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:37,889
Boy.

1451
01:13:38,089 --> 01:13:40,790
- Good work. You can come out now. - Okay, thank you.

1452
01:13:41,290 --> 01:13:42,388
She's good.

1453
01:13:42,389 --> 01:13:43,518
I did it!

1454
01:13:43,519 --> 01:13:45,459
I hope I get this part.

1455
01:13:45,559 --> 01:13:46,628
(Who will take part number 1?)

1456
01:13:46,629 --> 01:13:48,030
I can do it one more time.

1457
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:49,400
I'm sorry, guys.

1458
01:13:49,401 --> 01:13:51,199
- No. - No, that's okay.

1459
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:52,370
I apologize because...

1460
01:13:52,570 --> 01:13:54,200
- I had to... - Yes?

1461
01:13:54,740 --> 01:13:56,069
reassign all the parts.

1462
01:13:56,070 --> 01:13:57,399
(Surprised)

1463
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:58,468
Yes, I'm sorry.

1464
01:13:58,469 --> 01:14:00,069
- No, it's okay. - As long as it suits us better.

1465
01:14:00,070 --> 01:14:03,679
Honestly, I didn't think you were going to be this good.

1466
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:06,410
- And you know, - Oh, boy.

1467
01:14:06,679 --> 01:14:08,849
you're all so good, and we had to rethink things.

1468
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:12,490
I don't think we assigned you to the right parts before.

1469
01:14:12,519 --> 01:14:16,320
Some of you will play slightly bigger roles.

1470
01:14:16,620 --> 01:14:20,258
To make sure you win as a team, it was inevitable.

1471
01:14:20,259 --> 01:14:21,759
- Okay. - I hope you'll understand.

1472
01:14:22,129 --> 01:14:24,668
- It's here. - Gosh!

1473
01:14:24,669 --> 01:14:26,428
- Show me. - I can't wait.

1474
01:14:26,429 --> 01:14:27,499
- I'm nervous. - Here we go.

1475
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:29,338
One, two, three!

1476
01:14:29,339 --> 01:14:31,769
(Their new parts are revealed.)

1477
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:37,839
(Seowon looks disappointed.)

1478
01:14:39,450 --> 01:14:43,349
(Meanwhile, Elisia looks surprised.)

1479
01:14:44,150 --> 01:14:45,219
Here it is.

1480
01:14:45,820 --> 01:14:50,588
I was assigned to many parts,

1481
01:14:50,589 --> 01:14:53,359
and I'm very happy.

1482
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:56,759
(Elisia got 7 different parts as well as the main vocalist role.)

1483
01:14:57,059 --> 01:14:58,330
Oh, and...

1484
01:14:59,330 --> 01:15:02,269
I also got my favorite part.

1485
01:15:03,139 --> 01:15:05,809
I'm going to be...

1486
01:15:06,410 --> 01:15:09,209
singing the high notes.

1487
01:15:10,580 --> 01:15:11,708
It's really...

1488
01:15:11,709 --> 01:15:12,709
(Sighing)

1489
01:15:13,179 --> 01:15:15,379
I wanted part number one.

1490
01:15:15,549 --> 01:15:19,690
I'm disappointed that I didn't get the part with the high notes.

1491
01:15:20,419 --> 01:15:24,689
I heard you were reassigned to new parts last night.

1492
01:15:24,690 --> 01:15:26,859
- Have you learned your new parts? - Yes.

1493
01:15:26,860 --> 01:15:28,230
Okay, good.

1494
01:15:28,429 --> 01:15:31,699
I'm going to do whatever I want

1495
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:35,440
(Listening carefully)

1496
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:36,969
You can just do it like that.

1497
01:15:37,669 --> 01:15:39,169
I think that was good.

1498
01:15:39,209 --> 01:15:40,709
- Thank you. - Sure.

1499
01:15:40,839 --> 01:15:42,280
- Okay. - Good work, guys.

1500
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:47,250
There won't be any changes in our parts anymore, right?

1501
01:15:47,309 --> 01:15:48,878
- Probably not. - I don't think so.

1502
01:15:48,879 --> 01:15:50,219
I don't think there will be.

1503
01:15:50,419 --> 01:15:51,620
Just checking.

1504
01:15:51,690 --> 01:15:53,519
Right. We don't have much time left.

1505
01:15:53,719 --> 01:15:56,759
(On the day of recording of "WHATEVA")

1506
01:15:59,059 --> 01:16:00,458
Elisia, why don't you go first?

1507
01:16:00,459 --> 01:16:02,299
- Elisia. - You go first.

1508
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:04,258
- Okay. - Thank you.

1509
01:16:04,259 --> 01:16:06,129
- You'll be great. - You got this.

1510
01:16:06,570 --> 01:16:07,700
All right.

1511
01:16:09,139 --> 01:16:11,639
(Nervous)

1512
01:16:21,110 --> 01:16:22,479
(Satisfied)

1513
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:23,848
This is it.

1514
01:16:23,849 --> 01:16:26,150
I don't care, I'm going to do it my way

1515
01:16:26,190 --> 01:16:28,320
Keep it going, it's going to be hotter

1516
01:16:28,490 --> 01:16:29,959
- Man. - Great.

1517
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:31,489
That's so rhythmical.

1518
01:16:31,490 --> 01:16:33,860
There's no right answer to my love

1519
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:36,259
(The recording is going smoothly.)

1520
01:16:36,330 --> 01:16:39,169
It's not "ssa." It's "sa."

1521
01:16:39,330 --> 01:16:41,500
It's "my love."

1522
01:16:41,570 --> 01:16:43,040
Not "my love."

1523
01:16:43,299 --> 01:16:46,040
- There's no right answer to my love - She's just so good.

1524
01:16:46,740 --> 01:16:50,779
(She corrects her pronunciation at once.)

1525
01:16:50,780 --> 01:16:51,849
Her voice is just amazing.

1526
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:53,209
That was insane.

1527
01:16:53,549 --> 01:16:55,419
- It's insane, right? - It's incredible.

1528
01:16:55,719 --> 01:16:57,280
I think this is the last part.

1529
01:17:05,959 --> 01:17:08,599
Man, that was so good. She's on fire.

1530
01:17:09,429 --> 01:17:12,869
(She pulls off the main part perfectly.)

1531
01:17:12,870 --> 01:17:14,969
That was so good. She's on fire.

1532
01:17:16,599 --> 01:17:19,070
- Okay. - I want her to try this part.

1533
01:17:19,709 --> 01:17:20,969
Seowon's part.

1534
01:17:21,610 --> 01:17:22,879
Seowon's part.

1535
01:17:23,410 --> 01:17:25,149
"What do you know about love?"

1536
01:17:25,150 --> 01:17:27,109
(Worried)

1537
01:17:27,110 --> 01:17:29,349
Okay, let's try the first verse.

1538
01:17:30,950 --> 01:17:34,089
(Lim Seowon's part)

1539
01:17:35,820 --> 01:17:39,860
(Anxious)

1540
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:41,730
Come on, how could she be so good?

1541
01:17:43,299 --> 01:17:44,660
Elisia, I love your voice.

1542
01:17:45,070 --> 01:17:47,000
Thank you.

1543
01:17:47,769 --> 01:17:49,268
Really, really, really.

1544
01:17:49,269 --> 01:17:51,940
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1545
01:17:53,139 --> 01:17:54,809
- I think it's enough. - Okay.

1546
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:56,879
- Thank you. - Nice work.

1547
01:17:56,940 --> 01:17:58,508
- Great job! - Thank you.

1548
01:17:58,509 --> 01:17:59,779
- Good job! - Thank you.

1549
01:17:59,780 --> 01:18:01,009
Elisia!

1550
01:18:01,980 --> 01:18:03,349
Thank you.

1551
01:18:03,620 --> 01:18:05,120
- The baby of our team. - Let's go.

1552
01:18:05,549 --> 01:18:07,120
- Let's go, Seowon. - Let's go.

1553
01:18:11,790 --> 01:18:15,759
(Seowon tries Elisia's part.)

1554
01:18:15,799 --> 01:18:17,299
- Let's get started. - Yes.

1555
01:18:23,669 --> 01:18:27,570
They tell me I'm too young and just confused

1556
01:18:30,540 --> 01:18:31,878
- All right, Seowon. - Yes.

1557
01:18:31,879 --> 01:18:34,819
- Your singing is nice and clean, - Yes.

1558
01:18:34,820 --> 01:18:37,120
but I think you should act a little more.

1559
01:18:37,179 --> 01:18:38,319
- Act? - Yes. I mean,

1560
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:40,449
your singing is nice and clean,

1561
01:18:40,450 --> 01:18:41,790
- but you sound emotionless. - Okay.

1562
01:18:48,860 --> 01:18:52,599
They tell me I'm too young and just confused

1563
01:18:53,269 --> 01:18:54,968
- Yes, that's good. - Okay.

1564
01:18:54,969 --> 01:18:57,239
That was good, but it's the last notes.

1565
01:18:57,240 --> 01:19:00,309
You keep cutting the last notes of each line short.

1566
01:19:00,410 --> 01:19:01,679
What did I tell you earlier?

1567
01:19:01,980 --> 01:19:03,308
- Deeper breaths. - Deeper breaths,

1568
01:19:03,309 --> 01:19:04,809
- and more emotion. - Exhale deeply. Yes.

1569
01:19:05,179 --> 01:19:06,909
What do you know about love?

1570
01:19:06,910 --> 01:19:09,150
- She sounds good here. - Saying I'm too young

1571
01:19:09,849 --> 01:19:13,620
They tell me I'm too young and just confused

1572
01:19:14,490 --> 01:19:17,360
See? "Love" was okay, but "young" and "confused" were cut short.

1573
01:19:17,559 --> 01:19:20,360
Make those last words longer, okay?

1574
01:19:20,490 --> 01:19:21,598
The first line was good.

1575
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:22,730
(She struggles to understand his directions.)

1576
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:28,339
What do you know about love? Saying I'm too young

1577
01:19:28,469 --> 01:19:29,940
You sound tired. Again.

1578
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:34,370
What do you know about love? Saying I'm too young

1579
01:19:34,769 --> 01:19:35,838
They tell me

1580
01:19:35,839 --> 01:19:36,940
All right, you can do better.

1581
01:19:36,980 --> 01:19:38,449
Put more emotion into it.

1582
01:19:38,450 --> 01:19:39,579
(She finds it hard to sing with emotion.)

1583
01:19:39,580 --> 01:19:42,379
I know that it's hard to sing with emotion,

1584
01:19:42,879 --> 01:19:45,089
but if you sing certain parts with more power,

1585
01:19:45,589 --> 01:19:47,919
it'll sound much more like you're singing with emotion.

1586
01:19:48,459 --> 01:19:52,530
What do you know about love? Saying I'm too young

1587
01:19:52,959 --> 01:19:57,000
They tell me I'm too young and just confused

1588
01:19:57,599 --> 01:19:58,870
Good job.

1589
01:19:59,070 --> 01:20:01,329
- Nice work. - Okay, thank you.

1590
01:20:01,330 --> 01:20:03,440
- All right. - Good job.

1591
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:05,740
Nice work.

1592
01:20:06,169 --> 01:20:08,339
(The recording is over.)

1593
01:20:08,610 --> 01:20:10,379
Even if you lose some of your parts,

1594
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:13,379
- please don't be upset. - Okay.

1595
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:17,719
Especially Seowon. You're a great singer,

1596
01:20:18,589 --> 01:20:19,919
but I'm afraid...

1597
01:20:19,950 --> 01:20:21,789
you might sound a little unnatural.

1598
01:20:21,790 --> 01:20:23,388
(I see.)

1599
01:20:23,389 --> 01:20:25,089
- Something didn't sound right. - But she's good.

1600
01:20:25,330 --> 01:20:27,589
- Okay. - She's a good singer.

1601
01:20:28,230 --> 01:20:30,929
Your performance onstage is really good, but...

1602
01:20:31,559 --> 01:20:33,598
- What's the matter? - He said you're good.

1603
01:20:33,599 --> 01:20:35,339
- Why are you crying? - Why? I said you're good.

1604
01:20:37,269 --> 01:20:38,569
It's because you're young.

1605
01:20:38,570 --> 01:20:40,139
- That's right. - It's because you're young.

1606
01:20:41,980 --> 01:20:45,150
Let me go over the recordings,

1607
01:20:46,509 --> 01:20:47,679
and we'll talk about it.

1608
01:20:48,580 --> 01:20:51,379
(They stop the recording for a moment.)

1609
01:20:52,190 --> 01:20:54,149
Like the producers said, you're only 13.

1610
01:20:54,150 --> 01:20:56,290
Of course, there are some emotions that you don't understand.

1611
01:20:56,459 --> 01:20:57,519
You did a good job.

1612
01:20:57,820 --> 01:21:00,660
Are you upset because you couldn't do well as you hoped?

1613
01:21:01,129 --> 01:21:02,200
Yes.

1614
01:21:02,660 --> 01:21:04,330
You did really well, though.

1615
01:21:04,969 --> 01:21:05,969
Ordinary.

1616
01:21:06,530 --> 01:21:08,339
I feel like I'm nothing more or less than that.

1617
01:21:08,940 --> 01:21:11,709
I don't know what kind of emotion I should put into my voice,

1618
01:21:11,769 --> 01:21:15,980
and I'm not sure how I should sing my part.

1619
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:18,549
I really don't know what to do.

1620
01:21:19,910 --> 01:21:22,980
(The producers have called them back in after a discussion.)

1621
01:21:23,049 --> 01:21:25,150
Good work today, guys. Why did you cry?

1622
01:21:26,190 --> 01:21:27,319
What's the matter?

1623
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:28,689
(Puffy eyes)

1624
01:21:28,690 --> 01:21:29,990
We thought about it, and...

1625
01:21:36,030 --> 01:21:37,160
Let's just keep things as they are.

1626
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:39,369
Let's just keep things as they are.

1627
01:21:39,370 --> 01:21:40,798
(Fortunately, there are no changes.)

1628
01:21:40,799 --> 01:21:43,139
No changes. Now, Seowon.

1629
01:21:44,769 --> 01:21:46,240
I have one request.

1630
01:21:47,070 --> 01:21:48,639
"What do you know about love?" This is the part...

1631
01:21:48,780 --> 01:21:50,939
where you begin the song and catch people's attention.

1632
01:21:50,940 --> 01:21:52,349
- Yes. - So when you sing it,

1633
01:21:52,549 --> 01:21:55,149
I want you to sound overwhelmed. Figure out how to do that.

1634
01:21:55,150 --> 01:21:56,819
How do you sound overwhelmed?

1635
01:21:56,820 --> 01:21:57,980
Well, that's something...

1636
01:21:58,250 --> 01:21:59,389
you should figure out on your own.

1637
01:21:59,750 --> 01:22:04,419
(The recording ends, leaving Seowon with a big question mark.)

1638
01:22:05,129 --> 01:22:06,258
We should practice the dance.

1639
01:22:06,259 --> 01:22:08,059
(Team Forever's dance practice the next day)

1640
01:22:09,230 --> 01:22:12,769
I really don't know how to sound overwhelmed.

1641
01:22:12,929 --> 01:22:16,400
I'm not sure what kind of emotion it is, and I feel a little lost.

1642
01:22:16,669 --> 01:22:18,199
Doesn't it look a little different?

1643
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:22,440
But judging by the producers' directions,

1644
01:22:22,509 --> 01:22:26,950
it seemed like they liked Elisia's vibe the most.

1645
01:22:28,879 --> 01:22:31,179
- Look at this. What's this? - That's funny.

1646
01:22:35,089 --> 01:22:36,690
(Glancing)

1647
01:22:40,790 --> 01:22:46,070
(Seowon tries to copy Elisia's vibe.)

1648
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,000
That way first.

1649
01:22:50,001 --> 01:22:52,439
That's the same part.

1650
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:54,040
That's right.

1651
01:22:54,209 --> 01:22:55,410
All right.

1652
01:22:57,110 --> 01:23:02,580
(Seowon adds emotions to the dance moves like Elisia.)

1653
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,089
(Acting with her face)

1654
01:23:06,849 --> 01:23:09,519
(Her expressions become more natural.)

1655
01:23:09,589 --> 01:23:12,389
I know myself better

1656
01:23:15,129 --> 01:23:16,160
(Glancing over)

1657
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,199
- I have something to say. - Okay.

1658
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:21,268
We are focusing on the formation and dance moves,

1659
01:23:21,269 --> 01:23:23,039
- not facial expressions. - Okay.

1660
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:25,540
The two of you are focusing on the facial expressions instead.

1661
01:23:25,769 --> 01:23:28,169
The two of you are focusing on the facial expressions instead.

1662
01:23:28,269 --> 01:23:29,279
- Okay. - So...

1663
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:31,508
try to learn the dance moves first.

1664
01:23:31,509 --> 01:23:32,509
- Okay. - Okay.

1665
01:23:32,510 --> 01:23:33,979
- Okay. - Practice the facial expressions...

1666
01:23:33,980 --> 01:23:36,379
when you have perfected the dance moves and formation.

1667
01:23:36,549 --> 01:23:38,120
I know you are good at facial expressions,

1668
01:23:38,950 --> 01:23:40,820
so focus on the formation and dance.

1669
01:23:41,959 --> 01:23:44,889
(Practice begins once more.)

1670
01:23:47,629 --> 01:23:52,200
(Team Forever members grow as they watch each other.)

1671
01:23:54,370 --> 01:23:57,639
(How will their performance look?)

1672
01:23:57,969 --> 01:23:59,838
Don't get too excited. Be confident.

1673
01:23:59,839 --> 01:24:00,909
- Okay. - Be happy.

1674
01:24:00,910 --> 01:24:02,308
- "WHATEVA!" Forever! - "WHATEVA!" Forever!

1675
01:24:02,309 --> 01:24:03,309
- Whenever! - Whenever!

1676
01:24:04,209 --> 01:24:05,250
Let's go.

1677
01:24:05,450 --> 01:24:07,009
Good. They have the spirit.

1678
01:24:09,950 --> 01:24:11,519
Let's go.

1679
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:15,320
- Let's go. - Yes.

1680
01:24:16,889 --> 01:24:17,990
- Let's go. - I can't wait.

1681
01:24:39,179 --> 01:24:40,249
("WHATEVA" by Elisia, Oh Daeun, Lee Soovin, )

1682
01:24:40,250 --> 01:24:41,349
(Lee Eunchae, Lee Huran, Lim Seowon, Jin Hyeonju)

1683
01:25:42,410 --> 01:25:43,740
They are really good.

1684
01:26:55,349 --> 01:26:57,120
How is Elisia so good?

1685
01:26:57,219 --> 01:26:58,919
They are set.

1686
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:45,429
Unbelievable.

1687
01:27:46,169 --> 01:27:47,299
They are so good.

1688
01:27:47,429 --> 01:27:49,569
- They were just idol singers. - I know.

1689
01:27:49,570 --> 01:27:51,098
Elisia is really good.

1690
01:27:51,099 --> 01:27:52,139
- Thank you. - She is really good.

1691
01:27:57,379 --> 01:27:58,379
They are good.

1692
01:27:59,580 --> 01:28:01,449
- The high rank doesn't disappoint. - They are good.

1693
01:28:01,450 --> 01:28:02,819
- Thank you. - All of them are good.

1694
01:28:02,820 --> 01:28:04,418
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1695
01:28:04,419 --> 01:28:06,389
- Elisia can sing well. - Yes.

1696
01:28:09,190 --> 01:28:10,219
- They are good. - They did well.

1697
01:28:13,290 --> 01:28:14,428
Thank you.

1698
01:28:14,429 --> 01:28:16,459
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1699
01:28:22,669 --> 01:28:25,000
I could definitely see...

1700
01:28:25,610 --> 01:28:27,639
why you were in the high rank.

1701
01:28:27,839 --> 01:28:29,338
- Thank you. - They are really good.

1702
01:28:29,339 --> 01:28:30,439
Seriously.

1703
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:32,650
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1704
01:28:32,849 --> 01:28:33,849
Seriously.

1705
01:28:33,850 --> 01:28:38,080
Firstly, Elisia, you did an amazing job as the main vocalist.

1706
01:28:38,349 --> 01:28:39,718
Thank you.

1707
01:28:39,719 --> 01:28:41,490
Seriously. You did so well.

1708
01:28:41,690 --> 01:28:44,089
- She can sing really well. - Elisia can sing well.

1709
01:28:44,490 --> 01:28:46,790
The two youngest members...

1710
01:28:46,959 --> 01:28:48,729
have solid skills.

1711
01:28:48,730 --> 01:28:49,860
They are the solid members.

1712
01:28:50,230 --> 01:28:51,558
- Thank you. - They have the dance skills...

1713
01:28:51,559 --> 01:28:53,030
and the vocals.

1714
01:28:53,570 --> 01:28:56,700
Eunchae and Seowon seemed to have a match of facial expressions.

1715
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,269
I was like, "Whom should I look at?"

1716
01:28:59,910 --> 01:29:01,309
I really enjoyed the performance.

1717
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:03,279
Everyone did well. Thank you for your hard work.

1718
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:05,649
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1719
01:29:05,650 --> 01:29:06,849
Thank you.

1720
01:29:07,110 --> 01:29:08,509
Both of them did so well.

1721
01:29:08,849 --> 01:29:10,620
I wonder which team will win.

1722
01:29:11,650 --> 01:29:13,249
All the high-rank teams are good.

1723
01:29:13,250 --> 01:29:15,348
- Seriously. - It was fun.

1724
01:29:15,349 --> 01:29:16,558
Yes.

1725
01:29:16,559 --> 01:29:18,160
The high rank didn't disappoint.

1726
01:29:18,719 --> 01:29:22,128
In overall, I think Team Forever did a better job...

1727
01:29:22,129 --> 01:29:23,899
in terms of the performance and vibe.

1728
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:25,129
- Really? - But...

1729
01:29:25,429 --> 01:29:28,169
- they didn't have a big punch. - I know.

1730
01:29:28,330 --> 01:29:31,999
On the other hand, every member of Team Highway stood out.

1731
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,969
- That's right. - Seriously.

1732
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:36,308
But nothing could beat the facial expressions...

1733
01:29:36,309 --> 01:29:38,178
- of the youngest ones. - No.

1734
01:29:38,179 --> 01:29:41,150
I really think Seowon was born with it.

1735
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:43,419
How did she make such facial expressions?

1736
01:29:43,650 --> 01:29:45,320
- The two teams were neck-and-neck. - Yes.

1737
01:29:45,950 --> 01:29:50,389
(It's time to find out which high-rank team won.)

1738
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:54,860
- Let's hold hands. - Hands?

1739
01:29:56,830 --> 01:29:58,129
- Hands. - It's okay.

1740
01:30:03,299 --> 01:30:05,239
(Which team will receive a chance to get promoted?)

1741
01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:08,339
We will now announce the result of Level Station.

1742
01:30:11,740 --> 01:30:14,110
It was hard for us to choose the winner.

1743
01:30:14,349 --> 01:30:16,480
The winner of the high rank match is...

1744
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:19,490
(Team Highway)

1745
01:30:19,790 --> 01:30:22,359
(Team Forever)

1746
01:30:22,360 --> 01:30:24,819
- How will they choose one? - How will they choose one?

1747
01:30:24,820 --> 01:30:26,888
- It's impossible. - It's so hard.

1748
01:30:26,889 --> 01:30:28,758
- It's so hard. - It's impossible to choose one.

1749
01:30:28,759 --> 01:30:29,799
It's hard.

1750
01:30:31,459 --> 01:30:33,669
The winner of the high rank match is...

1751
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:37,269
(To be continued)

1752
01:30:38,189 --> 01:30:40,430
The winner of the high rank match is...

1753
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:43,970
Team Highway.

1754
01:30:46,470 --> 01:30:47,600
Thank you.

1755
01:30:47,999 --> 01:30:49,170
My goodness.

1756
01:30:50,409 --> 01:30:53,509
(4 members of the winning team will get promoted.)

1757
01:30:53,510 --> 01:30:55,010
Don't cry.

1758
01:30:57,249 --> 01:31:01,679
(2 members of the losing team will get eliminated.)

1759
01:31:01,680 --> 01:31:02,880
Congratulations.

1760
01:31:03,850 --> 01:31:05,748
Four members of the winning team...

1761
01:31:05,749 --> 01:31:08,090
Oh, no. Which members of that team will get eliminated?

1762
01:31:09,489 --> 01:31:12,488
We will now announce the members who got promoted...

1763
01:31:12,489 --> 01:31:13,930
through Unicorn Ticketing.

1764
01:31:19,630 --> 01:31:20,739
The promoted members are...

1765
01:31:25,210 --> 01:31:26,409
Bang Yunha.

1766
01:31:27,210 --> 01:31:28,510
Thank you.

1767
01:31:29,279 --> 01:31:30,479
Thank you.

1768
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:31,649
(The sixth promoted member, Bang Yunha)

1769
01:31:33,149 --> 01:31:34,180
Nizi.

1770
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:36,619
- Thank you. - Well done.

1771
01:31:38,649 --> 01:31:40,460
Seriously. Well done.

1772
01:31:44,460 --> 01:31:45,859
(2 more members will get promoted.)

1773
01:31:46,859 --> 01:31:48,199
Bae Yeram.

1774
01:31:49,399 --> 01:31:50,729
(The eighth promoted member, Bae Yeram)

1775
01:31:50,730 --> 01:31:52,129
Thank you.

1776
01:31:52,130 --> 01:31:53,739
(The eighth promoted member, Bae Yeram)

1777
01:31:56,270 --> 01:31:57,539
Lastly...

1778
01:31:58,140 --> 01:32:00,238
Since I enjoyed the performance,

1779
01:32:00,239 --> 01:32:01,879
I thought that I might get promoted.

1780
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:04,148
I have always worked hard.

1781
01:32:04,149 --> 01:32:06,108
I know that I am talented,

1782
01:32:06,109 --> 01:32:08,249
so I hope there will be a good result.

1783
01:32:09,420 --> 01:32:10,420
Lastly...

1784
01:32:10,421 --> 01:32:11,589
(Who is the last member to be promoted?)

1785
01:32:11,590 --> 01:32:13,960
Kim Sujin, congratulations.

1786
01:32:14,289 --> 01:32:15,988
Thank you.

1787
01:32:15,989 --> 01:32:18,130
(The ninth promoted member, Kim Sujin)

1788
01:32:20,529 --> 01:32:23,528
Other members can get promoted through Fan Ticketing, okay?

1789
01:32:23,529 --> 01:32:24,829
You guys still have hope.

1790
01:32:25,399 --> 01:32:26,770
Congratulations.

1791
01:32:27,039 --> 01:32:28,970
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1792
01:32:32,909 --> 01:32:35,640
The losing team, please come up to the stage.

1793
01:32:36,550 --> 01:32:39,010
(2 members will get eliminated.)

1794
01:32:45,949 --> 01:32:48,159
Who will get eliminated?

1795
01:32:48,760 --> 01:32:50,759
- It makes no sense. - Seriously.

1796
01:32:50,760 --> 01:32:53,699
We will announce the eliminated members of high rank.

1797
01:32:54,529 --> 01:32:58,369
(Which 2 members will get eliminated?)

1798
01:32:59,466 --> 01:33:02,266
We will announce the eliminated members of high rank.

1799
01:33:03,296 --> 01:33:05,234
(Which 2 members will get eliminated?)

1800
01:33:05,235 --> 01:33:08,905
I think I might get eliminated.

1801
01:33:09,136 --> 01:33:12,506
I will feel so dejected if I get eliminated.

1802
01:33:12,945 --> 01:33:16,574
I will end up wondering if I did so badly...

1803
01:33:16,575 --> 01:33:17,816
if I get eliminated.

1804
01:33:18,115 --> 01:33:21,085
The two eliminated members of the losing team are...

1805
01:33:26,386 --> 01:33:27,495
Lee Soovin...

1806
01:33:27,695 --> 01:33:29,596
(The eighth eliminated member, Lee Soovin)

1807
01:33:31,865 --> 01:33:33,625
and Oh Daeun.

1808
01:33:34,396 --> 01:33:36,395
(The ninth eliminated member, Oh Daeun)

1809
01:33:36,396 --> 01:33:37,506
Thank you for your hard work.

1810
01:33:37,905 --> 01:33:39,766
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1811
01:33:40,035 --> 01:33:42,235
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1812
01:33:46,575 --> 01:33:48,615
I didn't want to cry before the cameras,

1813
01:33:49,146 --> 01:33:50,816
so I held back the tears.

1814
01:33:56,716 --> 01:34:00,896
(Why did you smile after getting eliminated?)

1815
01:34:04,195 --> 01:34:05,995
Although the team lost and I got eliminated,

1816
01:34:06,125 --> 01:34:07,765
I had no regrets...

1817
01:34:07,766 --> 01:34:10,596
regarding the performance.

1818
01:34:12,205 --> 01:34:15,405
I wanted to exit the stage in a cheerful manner.

1819
01:34:18,146 --> 01:34:19,146
It's okay.

1820
01:34:20,816 --> 01:34:22,146
You did well.

1821
01:34:23,716 --> 01:34:27,584
It was an experience I couldn't have as a mere trainee.

1822
01:34:27,585 --> 01:34:30,385
I took the stage while wearing a microphone...

1823
01:34:30,386 --> 01:34:33,324
and performed before the Unicorns.

1824
01:34:33,325 --> 01:34:36,555
It was very nice to experience...

1825
01:34:36,556 --> 01:34:39,066
things like that.

1826
01:34:39,226 --> 01:34:41,035
I had a happy time.

1827
01:34:43,535 --> 01:34:46,636
(All matches of Level Station are over.)

1828
01:34:47,006 --> 01:34:50,636
(30 girls survived.)

1829
01:34:51,705 --> 01:34:52,705
(Among...)

1830
01:34:52,706 --> 01:34:53,744
(the 30 girls...)

1831
01:34:53,745 --> 01:34:55,316
(who are here, )

1832
01:34:56,346 --> 01:34:59,985
(which ones will remain in the Universe?)

1833
01:35:00,085 --> 01:35:04,325
(The results will be revealed at the 1st Promotion Ceremony.)
