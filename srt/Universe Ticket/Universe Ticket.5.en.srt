1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,810
(This program is the fifth story...)

2
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:03,321
(of girls of different worlds with one dream.)

3
00:00:03,321 --> 00:00:04,551
(This program is the fifth story...)

4
00:00:04,551 --> 00:00:05,751
(of girls of different worlds with the dream of debuting.)

5
00:00:50,131 --> 00:00:52,671
(Universe Ticket)

6
00:00:56,771 --> 00:00:58,771
It's a new beginning.

7
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,910
It's another competition,

8
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:03,880
so I think I feel even more nervous.

9
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:08,280
(A total of 39 girls entered the Universe.)

10
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:12,380
The new stage for the debut in the Universe.

11
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,550
Road to PRISM.

12
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,061
When I first saw "Road to PRISM,"

13
00:01:19,091 --> 00:01:20,630
I felt overwhelmed.

14
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:22,190
(Universe Ranks)

15
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:25,160
There are five ranks in the Universe.

16
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:29,440
You all are currently in Rank M.

17
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,240
Everyone starts at the same rank.

18
00:01:32,511 --> 00:01:35,270
Only the eight contestants who make it to Rank PRISM...

19
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,841
will earn the PRISM Tickets and make the debut.

20
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:41,481
I really want to reach the top.

21
00:01:41,981 --> 00:01:44,821
I really want to earn the PRISM Ticket.

22
00:01:45,921 --> 00:01:48,250
(Road to PRISM, the first journey)

23
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,261
The start of the promotion battle.

24
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,860
Level Station will begin.

25
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,291
(The first step to promotion, Level Station)

26
00:01:54,431 --> 00:01:57,231
This really is a battle of survival.

27
00:01:57,231 --> 00:01:59,530
I will make sure to be promoted.

28
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,530
I will never lose.

29
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,440
- Awesome! - That's amazing.

30
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,270
No way! That was so amazing.

31
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:07,310
(Surprising performances of the girls full of spite)

32
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,941
I really didn't want to get eliminated.

33
00:02:08,941 --> 00:02:09,941
(And...)

34
00:02:09,941 --> 00:02:11,981
Through Level Station today,

35
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,550
there will be nine eliminations from the losing team.

36
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,580
(A total of 9 eliminations)

37
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,951
If your team were to lose,

38
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,150
who do you think will get eliminated?

39
00:02:22,691 --> 00:02:24,221
Gabi.

40
00:02:24,821 --> 00:02:25,930
Gabi or...

41
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:27,661
Gabi.

42
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,731
I think Gabi will be in a tough spot.

43
00:02:30,231 --> 00:02:31,731
Someone I'm wary of?

44
00:02:31,731 --> 00:02:32,930
I don't think there's anyone.

45
00:02:34,631 --> 00:02:36,971
(Episode 5: Competition)

46
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:40,411
The start of the debut survival to become Rank PRISM.

47
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,451
Road to PRISM begins.

48
00:02:47,781 --> 00:02:49,110
Road to PRISM.

49
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:55,251
The first Station to reach PRISM will be revealed.

50
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,460
- I'm so nervous. - Hold on.

51
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,560
- I'm so nervous. - I feel so nervous.

52
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,291
- Gosh. - Oh, no.

53
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,701
It's a new beginning.

54
00:03:04,131 --> 00:03:06,430
My heart was pounding. I felt really nervous.

55
00:03:06,531 --> 00:03:08,330
(What is the first Station?)

56
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,300
Look at that.

57
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,870
What? Level...

58
00:03:12,441 --> 00:03:14,340
- Level Station? - Level Station?

59
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,281
The first Station is Level Station.

60
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:18,310
Is it a level test?

61
00:03:19,451 --> 00:03:21,881
Your starting rank is M.

62
00:03:22,451 --> 00:03:26,721
However, you may be in different levels in the same Rank.

63
00:03:27,321 --> 00:03:28,951
There are different levels in the same Rank?

64
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:32,691
Through Level Station, with your own individual skills,

65
00:03:32,691 --> 00:03:35,191
you will be placed in Levels high, average, and low...

66
00:03:35,191 --> 00:03:36,460
and perform on stage.

67
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,731
According to high, average, and low Levels,

68
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:43,441
there will be different numbers of promotion and elimination.

69
00:03:43,441 --> 00:03:44,770
- What? - What?

70
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:50,340
For high, there will be 4 promotions and 2 eliminations.

71
00:03:51,781 --> 00:03:54,650
For average, there will be 3 promotions and 3 eliminations.

72
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,650
(Average: 3 promotions and 3 eliminations)

73
00:03:56,881 --> 00:04:00,821
For low, there will be 2 promotions and 4 eliminations.

74
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,890
- What? - You have to go home then?

75
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:06,191
This is harsh.

76
00:04:06,191 --> 00:04:07,490
I got goosebumps.

77
00:04:08,231 --> 00:04:11,131
Being in low will be tough.

78
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,601
Reaching high is a must.

79
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:16,440
What are your Levels?

80
00:04:16,641 --> 00:04:19,940
The method of deciding your levels will now be revealed.

81
00:04:20,341 --> 00:04:21,971
Oh, no!

82
00:04:23,481 --> 00:04:24,781
I feel nervous.

83
00:04:31,421 --> 00:04:34,091
(The Unicorns make a surprise appearance for the level test.)

84
00:04:34,091 --> 00:04:35,550
Oh, gosh!

85
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:40,031
- Hello! - Hello!

86
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:43,300
The first Station of the Universe.

87
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,360
Before we begin Level Station,

88
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,370
we have gathered to help decide your levels.

89
00:04:48,771 --> 00:04:50,370
- Right now? - Now?

90
00:04:51,471 --> 00:04:52,740
Your levels...

91
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,171
will be decided by the evaluation...

92
00:04:55,171 --> 00:04:57,740
of the second signal song, "Ticket to You."

93
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:00,680
(The second signal song after "Want to Come With Me?")

94
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,081
("Ticket to You" is a song filled with the hopes...)

95
00:05:04,081 --> 00:05:08,050
(of the girls wanting to earn the tickets to their debut.)

96
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:13,461
(The girls of the Universe have seen the choreography video.)

97
00:05:13,661 --> 00:05:15,531
(Unicorn Rian of LACHICA worked on the choreography.)

98
00:05:18,961 --> 00:05:21,300
The Level Test will begin...

99
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:26,870
in 30 minutes.

100
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:27,940
In 30 minutes?

101
00:05:28,841 --> 00:05:32,211
Please get changed and return to this place.

102
00:05:32,211 --> 00:05:33,380
Okay.

103
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,221
Wait. Thirty minutes?

104
00:05:36,651 --> 00:05:38,521
I can't go back.

105
00:05:38,521 --> 00:05:42,120
I must aim for the top.

106
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:44,760
I want to stay up high...

107
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,731
and get promoted.

108
00:05:49,031 --> 00:05:51,231
I'm confident in avoiding elimination.

109
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:54,231
(The girls have returned after getting changed.)

110
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,401
What do I do? I'm so nervous right now.

111
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,240
I feel so nervous.

112
00:05:58,341 --> 00:05:59,810
- I'm so nervous. - I feel more nervous...

113
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,141
- than the first round. - Really?

114
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:02,641
All right.

115
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:06,981
The Level Test will begin.

116
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:08,711
("Ticket to You" Level Test)

117
00:06:08,711 --> 00:06:09,820
(After singing and dancing in groups of 2,)

118
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,050
(the Unicorns will decide between high, average, and low.)

119
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:12,680
- Gosh. I'm so nervous. - Seriously.

120
00:06:13,151 --> 00:06:15,651
The choreographer of "Ticket to You," Unicorn Rian...

121
00:06:15,651 --> 00:06:17,860
will tell you the standards of evaluation.

122
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,331
- It's an honor. - It really is an honor.

123
00:06:22,331 --> 00:06:24,560
- LACHICA. - When will we get the chance to...

124
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,860
- work with LACHICA? - Exactly.

125
00:06:26,031 --> 00:06:29,130
The creator of the choreography is watching.

126
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,800
What do I do? I feel even more nervous now.

127
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:35,070
In "Ticket to You," there are many parts...

128
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,810
that display bright energy.

129
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:40,950
I will be looking into those parts in detail.

130
00:06:41,081 --> 00:06:44,450
As it has a bright energy, expressions will be key.

131
00:06:44,721 --> 00:06:47,351
Rather than just looking pretty,

132
00:06:47,351 --> 00:06:49,891
I hope it will be a performance that shows more than that.

133
00:06:49,921 --> 00:06:51,060
- Okay! - Okay!

134
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,560
Seeing the current system, I believe those in the lower tier...

135
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,601
have a great chance of being eliminated.

136
00:06:57,601 --> 00:07:00,070
You need to show your best...

137
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:02,800
and put on a perfect performance...

138
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,341
to get good results. You all know this, right?

139
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:05,771
- Yes! - Yes!

140
00:07:06,471 --> 00:07:08,370
Losing here means elimination.

141
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:11,740
I just wanted to avoid the lowest Level.

142
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,550
If I grit my teeth and do my best,

143
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:17,851
I feel confident that I'll survive until the end.

144
00:07:17,851 --> 00:07:20,851
I have that sort of confidence.

145
00:07:20,851 --> 00:07:24,091
We'll start with the first round.

146
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:25,391
(Who will be the first to start the Level Test?)

147
00:07:25,391 --> 00:07:26,630
I'm shaking.

148
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,891
Gosh, my heart.

149
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,560
Nana...

150
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,630
and Jang Sua, please come up.

151
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,630
(Nana and Jang Sua)

152
00:07:34,771 --> 00:07:36,440
You can do it!

153
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,401
- Let's go. - Good luck!

154
00:07:38,401 --> 00:07:41,240
If I go against Nana,

155
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,141
she'll be really talented.

156
00:07:43,141 --> 00:07:44,911
There will be a big comparison.

157
00:07:44,911 --> 00:07:47,180
I felt intimidated because of that.

158
00:07:47,411 --> 00:07:49,351
(How will Nana and Sua's Level Test go?)

159
00:07:49,351 --> 00:07:51,281
- Okay. - I'm excited for these two.

160
00:07:51,281 --> 00:07:52,921
I'm really excited.

161
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,950
Thank you in advance.

162
00:08:01,331 --> 00:08:02,331
(Impressed)

163
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,500
My ticket to you

164
00:08:10,841 --> 00:08:13,141
(Sua starts offbeat.)

165
00:08:19,211 --> 00:08:21,581
- Every day, every time - Every day, every time

166
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:25,221
- I've waited a long time - I've waited a long time

167
00:08:26,151 --> 00:08:28,950
(Sua is a bit ahead in terms of the beat.)

168
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,621
(Struggling)

169
00:08:33,661 --> 00:08:37,261
(There's a big difference in the beat.)

170
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,031
(Sua's mistakes continue.)

171
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:43,700
(Nana carries on without getting hindered.)

172
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,070
(Impressed)

173
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,871
- You're my ticket to you - You're my ticket to you

174
00:08:47,411 --> 00:08:48,840
- You, you, you - You, you, you

175
00:08:49,171 --> 00:08:50,480
- You, you, you - You, you, you

176
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,340
- My fluttering heart - My fluttering heart

177
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,080
She's good.

178
00:08:54,381 --> 00:08:55,710
The line is amazing.

179
00:08:56,011 --> 00:08:57,080
She's good.

180
00:08:57,421 --> 00:09:02,651
(Nana gets everyone's attention.)

181
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,521
- You're my ticket to you - You're my ticket to you

182
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:06,220
Okay.

183
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,361
Thank you.

184
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:10,200
- Nana is really good. - Right.

185
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:11,430
Great job!

186
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,671
Even during the 1-on-1 Battle,

187
00:09:13,671 --> 00:09:15,800
I remember admiring her lines.

188
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,171
Even today, her long arms and legs stood out.

189
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,070
- Right. - Her lines were distinct.

190
00:09:20,411 --> 00:09:22,141
Sua, are you feeling really nervous?

191
00:09:22,141 --> 00:09:23,141
Yes.

192
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,011
You need to work on the rhythm.

193
00:09:27,011 --> 00:09:28,850
A lot.

194
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,080
Okay.

195
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,151
I expected to go down to a low ranking.

196
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:34,720
I thought I was in big trouble.

197
00:09:36,661 --> 00:09:39,320
We'll meet the next contestants.

198
00:09:39,421 --> 00:09:42,330
Lee Eunchae and Kotoko.

199
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,230
(Surprised)

200
00:09:44,661 --> 00:09:50,970
I worked with Eunchae for "Dolphin."

201
00:09:51,241 --> 00:09:52,940
(Lee Eunchae and Kotoko worked together in the Revenge Battle.)

202
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:57,611
(Talented youngest contestant, Lee Eunchae)

203
00:09:58,241 --> 00:10:03,121
(Kotoko with cute charms)

204
00:10:03,781 --> 00:10:05,050
- Thank you in advance. - How cute.

205
00:10:05,121 --> 00:10:07,651
- The cute ones. - They're so cute.

206
00:10:07,651 --> 00:10:09,421
It's a tight match.

207
00:10:09,421 --> 00:10:11,391
- They're both so cute. - Right.

208
00:10:11,621 --> 00:10:14,230
(How will their Level Test go?)

209
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:17,861
(Interested)

210
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,700
- My ticket to you - My ticket to you

211
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,371
- How cute. - They're so cute.

212
00:10:23,641 --> 00:10:24,700
(Impressed)

213
00:10:28,741 --> 00:10:29,741
(Hitting her hair)

214
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:33,111
- Every day, every time - Every day, every time

215
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:36,651
- I've waited a long time - I've waited a long time

216
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:42,151
- Now it's time - Now it's time

217
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:48,930
(They're stable with no mistakes.)

218
00:10:49,031 --> 00:10:50,060
(Impressed)

219
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,861
- You're my ticket to you - You're my ticket to you

220
00:10:52,501 --> 00:10:53,871
- You, you, you - You, you, you

221
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,631
- You, you, you - You, you, you

222
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,541
- My fluttering heart - My fluttering heart

223
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:59,501
- You're my ticket to you - You're my ticket to you

224
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,171
- You, you, you - You, you, you

225
00:11:01,641 --> 00:11:03,080
- You, you, you - You, you, you

226
00:11:03,381 --> 00:11:05,041
- Days that are like a miracle - Days that are like a miracle

227
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:06,911
- You're my ticket to you - You're my ticket to you

228
00:11:06,911 --> 00:11:07,911
(Ti...)

229
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,350
(Oh, no!)

230
00:11:12,651 --> 00:11:15,291
How cute! That was so cute!

231
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,861
(Kotoko's cute mistake makes everyone laugh.)

232
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:22,291
- She's so cute. - It's an act, right?

233
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:23,330
Gosh.

234
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,560
My goodness.

235
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,800
- She's so cute. - She's cute pulling her hair too.

236
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,800
- Well done. - Well done.

237
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,440
- Haven't they really improved? - Yes.

238
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,070
- They really have improved. - Right.

239
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:35,710
Especially with Kotoko.

240
00:11:35,871 --> 00:11:38,440
In terms of singing and dancing, she really improved.

241
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,680
Right. She really has improved.

242
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:47,991
(Smacking)

243
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,291
Who are you?

244
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:55,830
- Who is she? - Who are you?

245
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:57,901
Goodness.

246
00:11:57,901 --> 00:11:59,261
Why are you crying?

247
00:11:59,661 --> 00:12:01,930
I didn't expect to hear compliments.

248
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,470
- Oh, really? - You did really well.

249
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:05,771
You have really improved.

250
00:12:05,771 --> 00:12:07,371
You have to work even harder.

251
00:12:07,371 --> 00:12:08,411
Okay.

252
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,541
I can do it.

253
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,381
- You can do it! - Yes!

254
00:12:12,511 --> 00:12:14,680
- Eunchae did well too. - Eunchae did really well.

255
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,180
- She did well. - Right.

256
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,281
Shall I say you've learned your own groove?

257
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,350
Her expressions were really cute when she was dancing.

258
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,021
She had a stable balance.

259
00:12:24,021 --> 00:12:25,891
That's right.

260
00:12:25,891 --> 00:12:27,690
- She did well. - Well done.

261
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,031
Thank you.

262
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:32,060
They really improved.

263
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,131
- Right. - It really surprised me.

264
00:12:34,501 --> 00:12:35,930
We're all moved by them.

265
00:12:36,671 --> 00:12:39,100
Next up, Bang Yunha.

266
00:12:40,141 --> 00:12:41,671
Elisia.

267
00:12:41,671 --> 00:12:43,511
(Bang Yunha and Elisia are up next.)

268
00:12:43,611 --> 00:12:45,340
The best live performer.

269
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,411
- They're both really talented. - Right.

270
00:12:47,411 --> 00:12:49,381
They're both bright like the sun.

271
00:12:49,381 --> 00:12:51,151
- You're right. - Right.

272
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:54,450
Okay.

273
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,960
(Winking)

274
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,661
(These two contestants catch the eye from the start.)

275
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,470
(Amazed)

276
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:16,881
- T, I, C, K, E, T - T, I, C, K, E, T

277
00:13:16,881 --> 00:13:19,141
- Because I'm ready - Because I'm ready

278
00:13:19,141 --> 00:13:22,281
(They pull off the high notes well as well.)

279
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:24,281
- You, you, you - You, you, you

280
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,180
- You, you, you - You, you, you

281
00:13:26,521 --> 00:13:28,021
- My fluttering heart - My fluttering heart

282
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:29,960
(Proud)

283
00:13:30,161 --> 00:13:33,930
(Their live singing is spot on even with the dancing.)

284
00:13:33,991 --> 00:13:35,661
- Days that are like a miracle - Days that are like a miracle

285
00:13:35,661 --> 00:13:37,661
- You're my ticket to you - You're my ticket to you

286
00:13:37,661 --> 00:13:39,361
Okay!

287
00:13:39,531 --> 00:13:40,631
They're outstanding.

288
00:13:40,631 --> 00:13:41,970
- Thank you. - Thank you.

289
00:13:42,401 --> 00:13:44,741
You both are so good.

290
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:47,210
- Great job. - No. You did a great job.

291
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:50,480
- Look at those charms. - What?

292
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,580
Elisia is so cute.

293
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,080
Thank you.

294
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,881
Did you practice the expressions as well?

295
00:13:56,881 --> 00:13:57,881
Yes.

296
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:01,651
I did acting when I was younger.

297
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,121
I focus on my facial expressions a lot too.

298
00:14:06,861 --> 00:14:08,830
She's got feminine gestures too.

299
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,031
- I know, right? - Yes.

300
00:14:10,361 --> 00:14:13,230
- It's perfect for the song. - It was very good.

301
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,570
Thank you.

302
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:16,430
- Yunha. - Yes.

303
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:19,671
Despite your young age, you have...

304
00:14:19,671 --> 00:14:22,371
- a groovy voice. For a part like... - I see.

305
00:14:22,371 --> 00:14:23,641
My fluttering heart

306
00:14:23,641 --> 00:14:25,781
You sang it with a groove.

307
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,180
My fluttering heart

308
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,980
I think you're the first one who sang the part like that...

309
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,480
- among the contestants we've seen. - Thank you.

310
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,090
These two are...

311
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:37,560
- all-round artists, I think. - Right.

312
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,421
Thank you.

313
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:44,060
Next up are...

314
00:14:44,901 --> 00:14:46,361
Kim Sumin...

315
00:14:47,401 --> 00:14:48,700
and Aya Natsumi.

316
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,671
Aya.

317
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,570
Good luck.

318
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,980
- Good luck. - You got this.

319
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,381
I was very impressed by her "DDU-DU DDU-DU" performance.

320
00:15:00,381 --> 00:15:02,710
Sumin's got many different charms.

321
00:15:02,751 --> 00:15:05,320
She sings very well...

322
00:15:05,381 --> 00:15:07,151
and also dances well.

323
00:15:07,151 --> 00:15:08,991
She looks perfect.

324
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,820
So I thought she'd rank high.

325
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,761
(During the rehearsal of Revenge Battle)

326
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:17,501
(A good vocalist)

327
00:15:17,631 --> 00:15:20,830
(A good dancer)

328
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:23,501
(Sumin pulled off everything perfectly.)

329
00:15:23,771 --> 00:15:25,100
- Are you ready? - Yes.

330
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,200
Yes.

331
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:29,840
- Every day, every time - Every day, every time

332
00:15:30,141 --> 00:15:33,480
- I've waited a long time - I've waited a long time

333
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:34,881
No more waiting

334
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:37,521
- Now it's time - Now it's time

335
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,550
- To the end of the universe - To the end of the universe

336
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,921
(The rhythm is getting faster and faster.)

337
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,631
- We shine brighter than anyone - We shine brighter than anyone

338
00:15:48,161 --> 00:15:51,300
(They keep singing offbeat.)

339
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,330
Our starlight shining the whole world

340
00:15:55,771 --> 00:15:57,940
- A step closer - A step closer

341
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,840
- A heart-fluttering miracle - A heart-fluttering miracle

342
00:16:02,911 --> 00:16:05,011
(They aren't singing in sync.)

343
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:06,781
- Let's go to the new world - Let's go to the new world

344
00:16:08,411 --> 00:16:10,850
- We can set off anytime - We can set off anytime

345
00:16:10,881 --> 00:16:15,090
- T, I, C, K, E, T - T, I, C, K, E, T

346
00:16:15,121 --> 00:16:17,161
- Because I'm ready - Because I'm ready

347
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:19,291
(Studying their faces)

348
00:16:19,361 --> 00:16:21,330
- You're my ticket to you - You're my ticket to you

349
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:25,200
(Their voices become out of tune now.)

350
00:16:25,261 --> 00:16:26,901
- My fluttering heart - My fluttering heart

351
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:28,830
- You're my ticket to you - You're my ticket to you

352
00:16:36,111 --> 00:16:37,611
Okay.

353
00:16:43,251 --> 00:16:47,220
The contestant who performed with me went sharp a little.

354
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:51,320
There were unexpected things...

355
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,631
that I had to take care of.

356
00:16:53,761 --> 00:16:55,730
So I was the most disappointed.

357
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:57,960
Both of you danced...

358
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,331
- faster and faster. - Okay.

359
00:17:00,331 --> 00:17:01,970
So I think...

360
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:04,371
you will need to work on that.

361
00:17:04,371 --> 00:17:05,440
- Okay. - Yes.

362
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,411
In the latter part of the song, you went sharp.

363
00:17:08,411 --> 00:17:11,540
But it was slightly higher in pitch.

364
00:17:11,581 --> 00:17:14,311
It was a little uncomfortable to listen to.

365
00:17:14,311 --> 00:17:18,081
I think you failed to control your breath.

366
00:17:18,081 --> 00:17:23,391
And I'd like you to watch the others' performances carefully.

367
00:17:23,391 --> 00:17:25,260
See how they are different from you.

368
00:17:25,321 --> 00:17:27,760
I think, as Younha said,

369
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,831
Natsumi probably practiced alone looking in the mirror.

370
00:17:32,401 --> 00:17:34,101
It's true that Unicorns...

371
00:17:34,101 --> 00:17:37,240
have become stricter since the 1-on-1 Battle.

372
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:40,371
This is the real beginning.

373
00:17:40,841 --> 00:17:42,411
They fell a little short of my expectations.

374
00:17:44,911 --> 00:17:46,950
Next up are Kwon Eunhyung...

375
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:49,611
and Idota Yui. Please come on up.

376
00:17:51,651 --> 00:17:52,921
- Good luck. - Good luck.

377
00:17:52,921 --> 00:17:54,591
- Good luck. - Good luck.

378
00:17:54,651 --> 00:17:56,621
- You got this. - Good luck.

379
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:59,020
- Now it's time - Now it's time

380
00:17:59,061 --> 00:18:03,831
- To the end of the universe - To the end of the universe

381
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,500
(They suddenly start singing flat.)

382
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:09,530
- A step closer - A step closer

383
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:14,470
(Kwon Eunhyung missed her part out of breath.)

384
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:16,740
- Let's go to the new world - Let's go to the new world

385
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,081
Yes!

386
00:18:18,811 --> 00:18:21,710
(Idota Yui sings in a loud voice.)

387
00:18:24,421 --> 00:18:26,450
(Kwon Eunhyung stops singing again.)

388
00:18:27,851 --> 00:18:29,851
- You're my ticket to you - You're my ticket to you

389
00:18:30,421 --> 00:18:31,760
- You, you, you - You, you, you

390
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,690
- You, you, you - You, you, you

391
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,861
- My fluttering heart - My fluttering heart

392
00:18:35,861 --> 00:18:37,331
- You're my ticket to you - You're my ticket to you

393
00:18:38,161 --> 00:18:41,500
(It looks as if she's lip-synching now.)

394
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,040
(Yui is so into her song.)

395
00:18:45,341 --> 00:18:47,470
- She's adorable. - How lovely.

396
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:48,740
So adorable.

397
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,081
She's so lovely.

398
00:18:52,641 --> 00:18:54,010
She's so energetic.

399
00:18:54,381 --> 00:18:56,081
- I like her energy. - Right.

400
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,321
But Yui was...

401
00:18:59,151 --> 00:19:00,391
too excited.

402
00:19:02,651 --> 00:19:04,190
- Right. - Yes.

403
00:19:04,821 --> 00:19:07,760
Your moves were a little too much.

404
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,301
Things will be a lot better if you work on that.

405
00:19:10,301 --> 00:19:12,131
- Okay. - That's what I thought.

406
00:19:12,131 --> 00:19:14,171
- Okay. Thank you. - Thank you.

407
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,740
I could tell Eunhyung...

408
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,411
tried to lip-sync when she was feeling nervous...

409
00:19:21,611 --> 00:19:23,911
or when she had to sing the parts she wasn't good at.

410
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,911
But...

411
00:19:25,911 --> 00:19:28,651
it's not like you're performing on a TV music show now.

412
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,881
We wanted to see how you'd practiced.

413
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,591
Everyone here is shy.

414
00:19:33,591 --> 00:19:37,260
But they all just try their best to sing even if it wasn't perfect.

415
00:19:37,821 --> 00:19:39,020
The lip-sync...

416
00:19:39,561 --> 00:19:41,430
wasn't a good choice.

417
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,631
- Okay. - Okay.

418
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:44,500
Eunhyung, when you sing,

419
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:46,901
you press every note like playing the keyboard.

420
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:48,901
But you need to practice...

421
00:19:48,901 --> 00:19:51,000
connecting the notes like a wind instrument.

422
00:19:51,141 --> 00:19:52,171
In falsetto...

423
00:19:52,671 --> 00:19:55,770
(Younha gives a demonstration to give her advice.)

424
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:59,081
You should practice lowering the keys like this.

425
00:19:59,141 --> 00:20:01,250
Then you won't be afraid to sing high notes.

426
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,921
- Okay. - You need to practice a lot.

427
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:05,980
- All right. - Thank you.

428
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:09,520
My singing ability isn't good enough.

429
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,760
So I thought I'd rank low.

430
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:14,161
I feel like I'm in an uncertain position.

431
00:20:15,091 --> 00:20:16,161
Next.

432
00:20:16,631 --> 00:20:19,901
Gabi and Lim Seowon. Please come on up.

433
00:20:20,601 --> 00:20:22,301
What? Is it Gabi?

434
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,371
I was a little nervous.

435
00:20:26,671 --> 00:20:30,240
(Gabi and Lim Seowon teamed up for the Revenge Battle.)

436
00:20:30,341 --> 00:20:34,480
(They practiced together as a team.)

437
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:38,720
(They showed the textbook cuteness with their lovely chemistry.)

438
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:39,950
My gosh.

439
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,351
They met again as rivals.

440
00:20:41,821 --> 00:20:43,351
It's a big match.

441
00:20:43,421 --> 00:20:44,720
They both are high ranks.

442
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,891
I have to move up to a higher rank no matter what.

443
00:20:46,891 --> 00:20:50,131
I was confident in singing.

444
00:20:50,131 --> 00:20:51,831
They approved of me.

445
00:20:51,901 --> 00:20:54,301
So I thought I had a good chance.

446
00:20:54,401 --> 00:20:57,540
She's a good friend, and she's really good.

447
00:20:57,671 --> 00:20:59,401
But I'm confident.

448
00:20:59,601 --> 00:21:01,911
I will win and become a higher rank.

449
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,680
- Gosh. - What?

450
00:21:07,081 --> 00:21:08,980
- Look how talented she is. - Gosh.

451
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:10,720
My ticket to you

452
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:16,551
They're good.

453
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:21,190
- T, I, C, K, E, T - T, I, C, K, E, T

454
00:21:21,331 --> 00:21:23,631
- Because I'm ready - Because I'm ready

455
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,430
(Seowon's voice is ear-catching.)

456
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,030
- You're my ticket to you - You're my ticket to you

457
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:29,171
- You, you, you - You, you, you

458
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:30,940
Okay.

459
00:21:31,071 --> 00:21:32,740
- My fluttering heart - My fluttering heart

460
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:34,411
- You're my ticket to you - You're my ticket to you

461
00:21:35,071 --> 00:21:36,571
- You, you, you - You, you, you

462
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,381
- You, you, you - You, you, you

463
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:40,210
- My fluttering heart - My fluttering heart

464
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,811
- You're my ticket to you - You're my ticket to you

465
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:44,351
- Okay. - All right.

466
00:21:44,351 --> 00:21:45,450
Thank you.

467
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:47,990
- I like the energy. - I really like it.

468
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:50,520
- They are sparkling. - They really are.

469
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,790
I'm so excited now.

470
00:21:52,391 --> 00:21:54,161
You, you, you I was excited when they sang.

471
00:21:54,161 --> 00:21:55,290
You look excited.

472
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,530
You did really well.

473
00:21:57,601 --> 00:21:59,161
- Thank you. - I have nothing to say.

474
00:21:59,161 --> 00:22:01,301
- Thank you. - Thank you.

475
00:22:01,331 --> 00:22:03,301
- That was neat. - They both did well.

476
00:22:03,301 --> 00:22:05,571
They're so good. What do I do?

477
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:08,240
- I think Seowon is perfect. - I see.

478
00:22:08,611 --> 00:22:09,940
She's really good.

479
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:12,740
- Gabi fell a little short, right? - Yes.

480
00:22:13,111 --> 00:22:15,750
- We can't help but compare them. - Right.

481
00:22:16,051 --> 00:22:17,220
It's obvious.

482
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:20,151
Those who are good get even better over time.

483
00:22:20,151 --> 00:22:21,190
Exactly.

484
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,290
(The Level Test continues.)

485
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:25,421
That's it.

486
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,960
- You, you, you - You, you, you

487
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:30,661
(Kim Soobin and Lee Huran showed a stable live performance.)

488
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,661
- You, you, you - You, you, you

489
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,470
- You, you, you - You, you, you

490
00:22:34,631 --> 00:22:36,530
- Days that are like a miracle - Days that are like a miracle

491
00:22:36,601 --> 00:22:38,301
- You're my ticket to you - You're my ticket to you

492
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,671
(Kim Sujin showed a different move alone.)

493
00:22:41,671 --> 00:22:42,911
Thank you.

494
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,411
The ending.

495
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,551
- Like this. - The ending.

496
00:22:47,551 --> 00:22:50,051
Did you intend it? Or was it a mistake?

497
00:22:50,051 --> 00:22:51,081
I intended it.

498
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,091
You intended it?

499
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:55,790
Impressive.

500
00:22:55,891 --> 00:22:57,990
- Thank you. - Okay.

501
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,661
Next.

502
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,460
Jayla...

503
00:23:01,861 --> 00:23:03,730
and Gehlee Dangca.

504
00:23:04,561 --> 00:23:06,061
It's a battle of queens.

505
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,200
- Unbelievable. - A battle of queens.

506
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:10,500
Are they doing it together again?

507
00:23:10,601 --> 00:23:13,141
I think they were together during the 1-on-1 Battle.

508
00:23:13,401 --> 00:23:15,341
(They first met at the 1-on-1 Battle.)

509
00:23:15,671 --> 00:23:18,081
(Then they met again at the Revenge Battle.)

510
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:19,680
I have a good feeling about this team.

511
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,980
Hello.

512
00:23:23,651 --> 00:23:26,950
(Gehlee Dangca says hello politely like a queen.)

513
00:23:27,891 --> 00:23:29,250
She's adorable.

514
00:23:29,351 --> 00:23:30,520
Good luck.

515
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,690
(Their graceful gestures and waves stand out.)

516
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:38,131
They are two princesses.

517
00:23:39,331 --> 00:23:42,101
- Every day, every time - Every day, every time

518
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:45,770
- I've waited a long time - I've waited a long time

519
00:23:46,101 --> 00:23:47,341
No more waiting

520
00:23:47,341 --> 00:23:48,770
- Now it's time - Now it's time

521
00:23:48,841 --> 00:23:49,940
(Groovy)

522
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:51,510
- To the end of the universe - To the end of the universe

523
00:23:51,641 --> 00:23:55,450
- T, I, C, K, E, T - T, I, C, K, E, T

524
00:23:55,611 --> 00:23:57,881
- Because I'm ready - Because I'm ready

525
00:23:59,051 --> 00:24:01,051
- You're my ticket to you - You're my ticket to you

526
00:24:01,921 --> 00:24:03,391
- You, you, you - You, you, you

527
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:04,960
- You, you, you - You, you, you

528
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,921
- My fluttering heart - My fluttering heart

529
00:24:06,921 --> 00:24:08,690
- You're my ticket to you - You're my ticket to you

530
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,601
- You, you, you - You, you, you

531
00:24:11,101 --> 00:24:12,500
- You, you, you - You, you, you

532
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:14,331
- Days that are like a miracle - Days that are like a miracle

533
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:16,331
- You're my ticket to you - You're my ticket to you

534
00:24:16,331 --> 00:24:18,470
All right.

535
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,210
This is strange.

536
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,641
- They are giving us a hard time. - Right.

537
00:24:22,641 --> 00:24:24,710
They all improved a lot.

538
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:25,710
- Yes. - Yes.

539
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:26,740
And...

540
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:30,111
did you see that Gehlee Dangca closed her eyes while doing this?

541
00:24:30,111 --> 00:24:31,151
Yes.

542
00:24:32,921 --> 00:24:34,190
(Closing her eyes)

543
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:38,061
I think she dances in a charming way.

544
00:24:38,061 --> 00:24:39,361
It was nice to watch.

545
00:24:39,421 --> 00:24:41,690
But you need to work on your dance moves a little.

546
00:24:42,161 --> 00:24:43,161
Okay.

547
00:24:43,161 --> 00:24:47,161
And Jayla, I remember that you showed...

548
00:24:47,161 --> 00:24:48,601
more powerful moves.

549
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:51,171
I was disappointed I didn't see it today.

550
00:24:51,171 --> 00:24:53,141
Your moves were precise though.

551
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,970
- Okay. - Thank you.

552
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,710
Next.

553
00:24:58,710 --> 00:24:59,780
(The last Level Test)

554
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:03,210
Kwon Chaewon and Narumi, please come on up.

555
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,980
(Kwon Chaewon and Narumi, the last contestants)

556
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,391
- Good luck. - Good luck.

557
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:08,591
Good luck.

558
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:13,861
What I have shown here wasn't good enough.

559
00:25:14,091 --> 00:25:18,260
So I really wanted to rank high.

560
00:25:19,331 --> 00:25:20,601
I hope they will do well.

561
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:24,341
- Good luck. - Good luck.

562
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,601
- Good luck. - Good luck.

563
00:25:26,871 --> 00:25:28,911
(How will their Level Test go?)

564
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:32,411
- I've waited a long time - I've waited a long time

565
00:25:33,911 --> 00:25:36,311
- Now it's time - Now it's time

566
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,381
- To the end of the universe - To the end of the universe

567
00:25:38,381 --> 00:25:40,891
- I'll go with you - I'll go with you

568
00:25:40,891 --> 00:25:44,760
- T, I, C, K, E, T - T, I, C, K, E, T

569
00:25:44,921 --> 00:25:47,260
- Because I'm ready - Because I'm ready

570
00:25:48,561 --> 00:25:50,460
- You're my ticket to you - You're my ticket to you

571
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,230
- You, you, you - You, you, you

572
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,230
- You, you, you - You, you, you

573
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:56,071
- My fluttering heart - My fluttering heart

574
00:25:56,071 --> 00:25:57,801
- You're my ticket to you - You're my ticket to you

575
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,841
- You, you, you - You, you, you

576
00:26:00,341 --> 00:26:01,611
- You, you, you - You, you, you

577
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:03,571
- Days that are like a miracle - Days that are like a miracle

578
00:26:03,671 --> 00:26:05,480
- You're my ticket to you - You're my ticket to you

579
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,510
Well done.

580
00:26:13,851 --> 00:26:15,091
- Narumi. - Yes.

581
00:26:15,091 --> 00:26:19,720
I don't think you made good use of your body which is your strength,

582
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,891
- so it was a little disappointing. - Okay.

583
00:26:21,891 --> 00:26:24,631
You need to use your fingertips and the tips of your toes well...

584
00:26:24,631 --> 00:26:27,730
to balance your performance.

585
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:30,071
- Okay. - That's what you need to practice.

586
00:26:30,071 --> 00:26:31,141
- Okay. - All right.

587
00:26:31,641 --> 00:26:33,700
- Chaewon. - Yes.

588
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:37,111
To be honest, as a member of a girl group like you,

589
00:26:37,111 --> 00:26:38,111
Yes.

590
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:39,881
I wanted to support you.

591
00:26:39,881 --> 00:26:41,081
- I see. - And...

592
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:45,750
I think I can finally support you after watching this performance.

593
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,891
- Thank you. - I'm serious.

594
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:50,921
- Well done. - Oh, no.

595
00:26:51,391 --> 00:26:52,821
Don't cry.

596
00:26:52,821 --> 00:26:55,091
I was very excited watching your performance.

597
00:26:55,091 --> 00:26:56,260
I liked your energy.

598
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,801
- Right. - I liked your facial expressions.

599
00:26:57,801 --> 00:26:59,230
Have you improved?

600
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:02,270
Or did you finally manage to show your real ability?

601
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:04,970
I really liked it. You were great.

602
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:06,540
Thank you.

603
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:09,770
You got this.

604
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:14,881
I feel relieved now.

605
00:27:14,881 --> 00:27:16,111
- Today... - I had a heavy heart.

606
00:27:16,111 --> 00:27:17,151
I know.

607
00:27:17,151 --> 00:27:19,480
I was afraid I'd have to say something bad.

608
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,151
I'm so relieved.

609
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,921
- You're the best. - You did well.

610
00:27:22,921 --> 00:27:24,190
- You were amazing. - You're the best.

611
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:25,960
I finally won praise.

612
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,561
It meant a lot to me.

613
00:27:28,561 --> 00:27:30,490
That's what I really wanted to hear.

614
00:27:32,361 --> 00:27:33,361
(The Level Test is over.)

615
00:27:33,361 --> 00:27:34,831
Let's go through them one by one.

616
00:27:35,101 --> 00:27:36,171
First...

617
00:27:36,171 --> 00:27:38,700
Let's say high, average, and low.

618
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,240
- Okay. - Jang Sua.

619
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,641
- Low. - Low.

620
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,371
Seriously,

621
00:27:43,371 --> 00:27:44,581
- what do we do with her? - She lacks confidence.

622
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:45,581
Right.

623
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,010
And...

624
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:48,210
- Lim Seowon is... - High.

625
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:49,250
Right, high.

626
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,381
- High. - She's really good.

627
00:27:51,381 --> 00:27:52,750
She must be tired too.

628
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,821
Next is Gehlee Dangca.

629
00:27:54,821 --> 00:27:57,591
- I think she's low. - I agree.

630
00:27:57,591 --> 00:27:58,760
- Low? - Yes.

631
00:27:59,891 --> 00:28:01,391
She's very charming.

632
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:02,760
But her dance...

633
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,861
What if Gehlee Dangca gets eliminated because of this?

634
00:28:05,861 --> 00:28:06,930
Won't you be disappointed?

635
00:28:08,671 --> 00:28:10,901
I'll be a little disappointed.

636
00:28:10,901 --> 00:28:12,440
(They are torn between her charm and ability.)

637
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,740
But when it comes to her ability,

638
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,440
I think she deserves low.

639
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,111
- Her ability? - Ability-wise.

640
00:28:18,111 --> 00:28:19,311
That's true.

641
00:28:19,311 --> 00:28:21,551
But her looks deserve high.

642
00:28:21,551 --> 00:28:24,480
And she sings pretty well.

643
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:27,121
- This is too difficult. - Right.

644
00:28:27,351 --> 00:28:28,851
So they are divided.

645
00:28:29,891 --> 00:28:30,990
Are we done?

646
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:32,020
- Yes. - We're done.

647
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:35,131
(The results of the Level Test will be revealed soon.)

648
00:28:58,621 --> 00:28:59,980
(High)

649
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:03,151

651

652
00:29:59,341 --> 00:30:01,881
(Average)

653
00:30:01,881 --> 00:30:04,680
(Gabi, Goo Gyoryeon, Kwon Chaewon, Kim Sumin, Nana)

654
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,020
(Nako, Bae Haram, Oh Yoona, Lee Sunwoo)

655
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,790
(Jeon Jinyeong, Jayla, Choi Hyerin, Kotoko)

656
00:31:02,811 --> 00:31:05,680
(Low)

657
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,010
(Kwon Eunhyung, Narumi, Riel, Minari, Vanesya)

658
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:10,081
(Park Yewon, Aya Natsumi, Yona, Idota Yui)

659
00:31:10,081 --> 00:31:12,980
(Jang Sua, Gehlee Dangca, Heo Sunbin)

660
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,000
(Average)

661
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,470
(Gabi, Goo Gyoryeon, Kwon Chaewon, Kim Sumin, Nana)

662
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:36,071
(Nako, Bae Haram, Oh Yoona, Lee Sunwoo)

663
00:31:36,071 --> 00:31:38,111
(Jeon Jinyeong, Jayla, Choi Hyerin, Kotoko)

664
00:31:49,121 --> 00:31:50,450
(High)

665
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,760
(Kim Soobin, Kim Sujin, Nizi, Bang Yunha, Bae Yeram)

666
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,230
(Elisia, Oh Daeun, Yuri, Lee Soovin, Lee Eunchae)

667
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:58,301
(Lee Huran, Lim Seowon, Jin Hyeonju, Hwang Sieun)

668
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:27,290
(The full version performances of each class...)

669
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:30,861
(and the surprising announcement of their levels...)

670
00:32:30,861 --> 00:32:36,500
(will be revealed online.)

671
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:40,301
No, Gabi.

672
00:32:41,911 --> 00:32:43,571
Don't worry about what already happened.

673
00:32:43,571 --> 00:32:44,611
You should do well...

674
00:32:46,081 --> 00:32:47,141
from now on.

675
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:50,250
Who do you think will be eliminated?

676
00:32:50,811 --> 00:32:52,321
Gabi.

677
00:32:52,321 --> 00:32:53,421
Gabi.

678
00:32:53,921 --> 00:32:54,990
Gabi.

679
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,260
I think Gabi might get eliminated.

680
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:01,730
(I think Gabi might get eliminated.)

681
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:07,770
This is another new beginning.

682
00:33:08,801 --> 00:33:11,440
I thought, "It's finally beginning."

683
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,171
I was very nervous.

684
00:33:14,171 --> 00:33:16,171
(Universe Ticket)

685
00:33:16,171 --> 00:33:20,341
(Level Station, D-day)

686
00:33:20,341 --> 00:33:23,151
(Waiting room)

687
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:26,581
I think the contestants are more determined now.

688
00:33:27,121 --> 00:33:29,250
Some of us will be eliminated.

689
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:31,821
So I have to try my best and give it my all.

690
00:33:32,321 --> 00:33:34,490
I believe in myself,

691
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:35,861
so I don't think I'll lose.

692
00:33:42,331 --> 00:33:45,871
The new gateway to the debut on Universe Ticket.

693
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:47,671
Road to PRISM.

694
00:33:48,811 --> 00:33:50,740
The girls who have advanced to the Universe...

695
00:33:50,841 --> 00:33:52,811
will get their first promotion opportunity...

696
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,780
to the PRISM Level...

697
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:57,111
in the Level Station today.

698
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,250
I'm nervous.

699
00:33:59,821 --> 00:34:01,121
This is the first promotion.

700
00:34:01,891 --> 00:34:03,151
Level Station will be...

701
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:06,660
divided into high, average, and low.

702
00:34:06,861 --> 00:34:08,861
The same levels will compete against each other.

703
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:10,861
Who will win and lose...

704
00:34:11,931 --> 00:34:14,261
will be chosen by the Unicorns.

705
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:15,931
I'm in your care.

706
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,500
Through the Unicorn Ticketing,

707
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,011
nine will get promoted from the winning team,

708
00:34:23,471 --> 00:34:26,940
and nine will get eliminated from the losing team.

709
00:34:27,011 --> 00:34:30,080
(Out of 39 participants, 9 will get eliminated.)

710
00:34:30,181 --> 00:34:32,520
The fact that some will get eliminated makes me sad.

711
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,350
(Who will get promoted, and who will get eliminated?)

712
00:34:35,591 --> 00:34:37,790
The official war of promotions,

713
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,290
the Level Station,

714
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,290
will start now.

715
00:34:43,931 --> 00:34:45,761
- This day has come. - I know, right?

716
00:34:48,301 --> 00:34:52,270
The two average teams, please come onto the stage.

717
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:55,810
(1st Level Station: Average Level Battle)

718
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,381
- Hi. - Hi.

719
00:34:59,381 --> 00:35:01,750
- Hi. - Hi.

720
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:04,080
- Hi. - Hi.

721
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:06,620
How adorable.

722
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:08,350
Gosh, seriously.

723
00:35:08,651 --> 00:35:10,290
They must be really nervous.

724
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:11,690
Good luck, guys!

725
00:35:11,991 --> 00:35:12,991
Good luck!

726
00:35:12,991 --> 00:35:14,160
Let's go!

727
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,361
(The 2nd average team appears.)

728
00:35:18,031 --> 00:35:20,230
What's with their chicness?

729
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,401
The outfits are amazing.

730
00:35:22,401 --> 00:35:23,500
For real?

731
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,940
It's almost like "Genie."

732
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,140
(Their outfit concept is eye-catching.)

733
00:35:30,241 --> 00:35:31,910
This team is tall, while the other team is cute.

734
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:32,910
Right?

735
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:34,810
They have completely different concepts.

736
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:35,850
Yes.

737
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:38,350
Each participant is in the concept that they fit in.

738
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,421
They look different, like black and pink.

739
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,491
(14 days before in the afternoon after the Level Test)

740
00:35:46,991 --> 00:35:48,960
- We're in your care. - Likewise.

741
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:53,301
I hope they recognize us. They will, right?

742
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,701
You're the MC today.

743
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,671
Why make me do this?

744
00:35:58,671 --> 00:36:01,000
- Hi. - Hi.

745
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,370
(The average teams walk in.)

746
00:36:05,511 --> 00:36:06,841
- Hi. - Hi.

747
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:09,080
(Amazed)

748
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,910
Hi, everyone.

749
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:12,750
- Hi. - Hi.

750
00:36:14,451 --> 00:36:17,821
I'm ADORA, a producer before you today.

751
00:36:17,991 --> 00:36:21,560
(Producer ADORA has come for the Level Station.)

752
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:24,190
Hi. I'm Nano of VENDORS.

753
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,201
Nice to meet you.

754
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,000
- Hi. - Hi.

755
00:36:27,401 --> 00:36:29,931
(They produced songs for major K-pop artists,)

756
00:36:29,931 --> 00:36:32,841
(such as "Spring Day" and "Not Today" for BTS,)

757
00:36:32,841 --> 00:36:37,640
("Round and Round" for NCT U, and more.)

758
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:43,250
(An all-rounder producing team specializing in K-pop, VENDORS)

759
00:36:45,381 --> 00:36:46,781
Nice to meet you.

760
00:36:48,921 --> 00:36:51,221
Hi. We're team PAPERMAKER.

761
00:36:51,221 --> 00:36:52,591
I'm TENZO.

762
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,991
Hi. I'm EB.

763
00:36:55,991 --> 00:36:58,960
I'm Samuel Ku. Nice to meet you.

764
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:09,270
("LILAC" by IU)

765
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:11,011
(They produced songs of all genres...)

766
00:37:11,011 --> 00:37:12,640
(like GFRIEND's "Me gustas tu" and "Glass Bead.")

767
00:37:13,011 --> 00:37:17,451
(A producing team making big hit K-pop songs, PAPERMAKER)

768
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:20,921
Meeting the people I had only seen on TV...

769
00:37:21,051 --> 00:37:23,951
in person was really cool.

770
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:25,861
- They're our competitor. - Hi.

771
00:37:26,591 --> 00:37:28,460
- As for me, - Yes?

772
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:32,761
I have watched your performances as a Unicorn...

773
00:37:32,761 --> 00:37:35,830
and remember what each of you did.

774
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:37,301
Can you pull it off?

775
00:37:37,301 --> 00:37:38,370
- Yes. - Yes.

776
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:43,940
The average participants who will be in our PAPERMAKER team are,

777
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:46,710
- firstly, Nana, - Here.

778
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:48,310
- Jayla, - Here.

779
00:37:48,451 --> 00:37:49,980
- Gabi, - Here.

780
00:37:50,511 --> 00:37:52,151
- Goo Gyoryeon, - Here.

781
00:37:52,221 --> 00:37:53,651
- Lee Sunwoo, - Here.

782
00:37:53,651 --> 00:37:54,690
- Bae Haram, - Okay.

783
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,290
and lastly, Jeon Jinyeong.

784
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:01,830
I can already paint a picture of our team.

785
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:02,960
They look good together.

786
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,301
Yes. I have a great feeling.

787
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,531
Visually-wise, they look good as a team.

788
00:38:08,531 --> 00:38:11,201
VENDORS should be worried about this mix.

789
00:38:11,201 --> 00:38:12,241
You mean us?

790
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,370
I have a good feeling about them.

791
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:17,540
Can't you tell just by looking at our team?

792
00:38:20,181 --> 00:38:21,951
- That they will win. - They will win.

793
00:38:22,151 --> 00:38:23,951
- That they will win. - They will win.

794
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:30,151
I wanted to be a team with Sumin.

795
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:34,390
But now that we're rivals,

796
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:37,290
I'm really anxious.

797
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:40,261
"I should give more of what I have."

798
00:38:40,261 --> 00:38:42,230
That was what I thought.

799
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,870
She was my competition.

800
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:48,310
Jinyeong and I were a team during the Revenge Battle.

801
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:52,480
She had great leadership...

802
00:38:52,511 --> 00:38:54,750
and killed the stage back then.

803
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:57,250
So I held her in check a tiny bit.

804
00:38:57,810 --> 00:38:59,281
Let's do our best.

805
00:38:59,281 --> 00:39:00,750
- We can do it! - We can do it!

806
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:01,991
(Full of tension from the start)

807
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:05,221
The song we, VENDORS, arranged is...

808
00:39:05,491 --> 00:39:07,421
I wonder how they arranged it.

809
00:39:07,861 --> 00:39:09,631
"Superstar" by Jewelry.

810
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:11,091
- I know the song. - You do?

811
00:39:11,531 --> 00:39:14,901
(It's a fast-tempo song with a rock-style flashy performance.)

812
00:39:14,901 --> 00:39:17,370
"Superstar" is a dance song that made...

813
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:20,870
the whole nation do the shaking dance.

814
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,681
- I know the song. - You do?

815
00:39:25,681 --> 00:39:26,910
- I do. - Really?

816
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:28,980
You are a superstar

817
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:31,821
We reinterpreted the song with VENDORS' band sound...

818
00:39:31,821 --> 00:39:35,321
and brought out a charm different from the original.

819
00:39:35,321 --> 00:39:36,421
Shall we listen to it?

820
00:39:36,421 --> 00:39:37,551
- Yes. - Yes.

821
00:39:37,551 --> 00:39:38,690
(A preview of "Superstar" by Jewelry)

822
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:44,560
(VENDORS' band version of "Superstar")

823
00:39:45,631 --> 00:39:46,901
Oh, my gosh.

824
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,801
(Shocked)

825
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,971
The song suits that team.

826
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,410
I like it.

827
00:39:59,841 --> 00:40:01,810
It's really nice.

828
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,210
- It's good. - Listen to the vocal.

829
00:40:05,221 --> 00:40:06,580
That's it.

830
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:10,520
I want to hear our song.

831
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,620
Me too.

832
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,991
She did the guide of the song.

833
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:17,861
That's right. As I sang the guide of the song,

834
00:40:17,861 --> 00:40:19,560
I was nervous to play this song.

835
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,301
What do you think? Can you do it?

836
00:40:21,301 --> 00:40:22,471
- Yes. - Yes.

837
00:40:22,671 --> 00:40:24,000
- I love it. - Great.

838
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,270
I also think you'll pull it off really well...

839
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:28,741
in your own style, so I'm feeling confident.

840
00:40:28,741 --> 00:40:30,671
- Let's do this! - Let's do this!

841
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:35,511
The song we, PAPERMAKER, arranged is...

842
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:38,551
"Girls On Top" by BoA.

843
00:40:42,951 --> 00:40:45,190
It's a song highlighting...

844
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:47,421
its powerful performance and neutral charm.

845
00:40:49,491 --> 00:40:51,560
Befitting to it,

846
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:54,160
please execute a cool performance.

847
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,971
Let's listen to "Girls On Top."

848
00:40:55,971 --> 00:41:00,100
(PAPERMAKER's version of "Girls On Top")

849
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,841
It's already over.

850
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:14,821
Don't you think Nana will look cool?

851
00:41:14,821 --> 00:41:16,290
Yes, she'll look really cool.

852
00:41:16,921 --> 00:41:18,120
It's your song, Nana.

853
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:31,131
- It's so good. - She did the guide.

854
00:41:31,131 --> 00:41:32,401
She sang the guide.

855
00:41:32,401 --> 00:41:33,640
(Producer EB sang the guide!)

856
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:36,341
(Is it an unexpected guide showdown?)

857
00:41:36,511 --> 00:41:38,640
When I heard "Girls On Top,"

858
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:41,181
I knew that was it.

859
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:44,111
It was my song.

860
00:41:44,281 --> 00:41:47,120
I thought our team would win.

861
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,551
The song was great.

862
00:41:48,551 --> 00:41:52,091
It was a style of song I liked.

863
00:41:52,221 --> 00:41:55,730
But I could tell the kind of performance they would do.

864
00:41:55,931 --> 00:41:58,801
So I thought our team would do better...

865
00:41:59,131 --> 00:42:01,671
and our team's song was better.

866
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:04,730
Well then, we look forward to your amazing performances.

867
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:05,801
- Okay. - Okay.

868
00:42:05,801 --> 00:42:06,870
(Which teams will win and lose?)

869
00:42:07,671 --> 00:42:10,940
The two average teams. Please introduce your teams to us.

870
00:42:11,171 --> 00:42:12,410
Two, three.

871
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:14,910
- We are Twinkle. - We are Twinkle.

872
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:19,151
Hi. We are the most sparkling stars in the universe,

873
00:42:19,281 --> 00:42:21,421
- Team Twinkle. - Team Twinkle.

874
00:42:21,421 --> 00:42:23,790
(Team Twinkle)

875
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:25,390
Twinkle.

876
00:42:27,361 --> 00:42:28,761
Attention!

877
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:31,160
Attention!

878
00:42:31,431 --> 00:42:33,060
- What? - That was cool.

879
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,031
Attention!

880
00:42:36,301 --> 00:42:38,000
- Girls on universe top. - Universe top.

881
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Hi.

882
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,870
- We're Team Attention. - Attention.

883
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:43,410
(Team Attention)

884
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:53,250
- They have good energy. - I agree.

885
00:42:54,051 --> 00:42:56,651
This performance will change...

886
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:59,560
the fates of half of the average team members.

887
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,821
Yoona.

888
00:43:01,221 --> 00:43:04,330
How did you feel after receiving the average level?

889
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:08,230
Honestly, I was upset when I received...

890
00:43:08,401 --> 00:43:10,131
the average level.

891
00:43:10,131 --> 00:43:14,270
However, I felt like I had a chance to win as this battle...

892
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:16,471
was among participants in the average level.

893
00:43:16,471 --> 00:43:17,710
The confidence.

894
00:43:18,681 --> 00:43:21,181
Now then, Team Twinkle.

895
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:22,951
Get ready to perform first.

896
00:43:23,111 --> 00:43:25,381
Team Attention. Leave the stage...

897
00:43:25,381 --> 00:43:26,681
and stand by.

898
00:43:27,781 --> 00:43:29,651
- I'm nervous. - Oh, no.

899
00:43:29,651 --> 00:43:31,051
It's finally starting.

900
00:43:31,821 --> 00:43:35,531
All right. The producers are with us right now.

901
00:43:35,861 --> 00:43:37,390
- Unicorn ADORA. - Yes?

902
00:43:37,591 --> 00:43:39,500
You're here as a producer today.

903
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:40,631
How do you feel?

904
00:43:40,631 --> 00:43:44,301
Hi. I should be over there with them.

905
00:43:45,171 --> 00:43:48,511
To be frank, I liked...

906
00:43:48,511 --> 00:43:52,540
how I could meet all of them more closely.

907
00:43:52,841 --> 00:43:55,651
I could feel their passion more.

908
00:43:55,651 --> 00:44:00,151
And as mentioned, we added a new melody to the song.

909
00:44:00,321 --> 00:44:02,390
The lyrics of that melody go like this.

910
00:44:02,551 --> 00:44:06,491
"Try to listen to the song of dreams at the end of this universe."

911
00:44:06,491 --> 00:44:07,520
That's the message of the song.

912
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:10,190
Just like the lyrics,

913
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:12,301
I hoped that the girls would be able to make a debut...

914
00:44:12,301 --> 00:44:14,361
at the end of this show when I worked on the song.

915
00:44:14,361 --> 00:44:16,471
I was wishing them luck the whole time.

916
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:19,571
I hope you will perform well with this positive energy from me.

917
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:23,611
(Universe Ticket)

918
00:44:23,611 --> 00:44:25,181
By the way, it seems to me...

919
00:44:25,341 --> 00:44:28,181
that you guys are feeling a bit down.

920
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:37,750
- I hope we work hard together. - Yes.

921
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:40,190
- All of us are dying to debut. - Right.

922
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:41,730
Our level is average.

923
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:43,531
- That's upsetting. Isn't it? - You bet.

924
00:44:44,631 --> 00:44:46,301
- Darn it. - Let's be honest.

925
00:44:46,301 --> 00:44:47,560
"Average?" Seriously?

926
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:52,571
One more thing. Does anyone want to be the leader?

927
00:44:54,370 --> 00:44:55,471
No one?

928
00:44:58,071 --> 00:44:59,181
None of you?

929
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:03,750
I had never been a leader in my group. So...

930
00:45:05,051 --> 00:45:07,181
This is the perfect chance for you to be the leader then.

931
00:45:09,151 --> 00:45:10,290
So...

932
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:11,721
since no one wants to do it,

933
00:45:12,921 --> 00:45:15,330
I'll take the position gratefully and do my best.

934
00:45:15,861 --> 00:45:18,261
I'll try to fulfill my responsibility as your leader.

935
00:45:18,631 --> 00:45:20,701
- Yes! - Yes!

936
00:45:20,701 --> 00:45:23,031
I wanted to be more ambitious from here on out.

937
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:26,571
To tell the truth, I now want to be the leader and the main vocalist.

938
00:45:27,171 --> 00:45:30,210
All right. We'll divide the song to assign your parts today.

939
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:31,270
- Okay. - Okay.

940
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:33,980
Actually, this is the most important agenda today.

941
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:36,951
One of you has to improvise singing high notes.

942
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:40,750
Is there anyone who would like to sing these high notes?

943
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:43,451
If you sing high notes, you'll stand out at the end.

944
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,890
Getting noticed one more time might be better.

945
00:45:45,991 --> 00:45:48,261
My name is Kwon Chaewon.

946
00:45:48,261 --> 00:45:50,160
- Yes. - I'd like to try out...

947
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,100
- for the main vocalist position. - The main vocalist?

948
00:45:54,361 --> 00:45:56,471
Let's hear it then, Chaewon.

949
00:45:56,471 --> 00:46:01,370
Don't forget it, you're a superstar

950
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:07,381
(This is the part with high notes which ADORA emphasized.)

951
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:11,551
- Okay. - Okay.

952
00:46:11,551 --> 00:46:12,580
Okay.

953
00:46:12,651 --> 00:46:14,821
- The way you sing your last note... - Yes.

954
00:46:15,221 --> 00:46:16,421
makes the song sound outdated.

955
00:46:16,551 --> 00:46:19,290
If you sing dance songs with vibrato, they sound outdated.

956
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:20,921
Chaewon,

957
00:46:20,921 --> 00:46:22,531
- you tend to elongate your notes. - I see.

958
00:46:23,031 --> 00:46:25,761
Does anyone else think they can sing these high notes?

959
00:46:28,401 --> 00:46:30,370
- I'll try it out. Yes. - Sumin?

960
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:32,171
- At last. - Gosh.

961
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,000
This is getting interesting now.

962
00:46:34,401 --> 00:46:37,071
- Can I sing on my feet? - Sure. Of course, you can.

963
00:46:37,071 --> 00:46:38,111
That's even better.

964
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:42,281
Actually, I want to sing the highlight of the song.

965
00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:45,681
I kind of want to be the main vocalist too.

966
00:46:46,381 --> 00:46:50,221
I'll be different

967
00:46:56,531 --> 00:46:58,261
- Nice. - She's very nice.

968
00:46:58,730 --> 00:47:01,460
- Very nice. - Your singing is very stable.

969
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:03,631
That's your biggest strength.

970
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:05,270
Thank you.

971
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:07,440
Gosh, this is...

972
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:09,440
It's hard.

973
00:47:09,471 --> 00:47:12,511
I didn't want to lose this part to another girl this time.

974
00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:15,651
The main vocalist is...

975
00:47:19,451 --> 00:47:20,551
Sumin.

976
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:23,651
Sumin, you're great.

977
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:25,690
You can keep performing like that.

978
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:27,060
(Sumin becomes the main vocalist.)

979
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:30,991
I was really disappointed, so I did feel a bit angry.

980
00:47:35,031 --> 00:47:36,031
- I want... - Who else?

981
00:47:36,031 --> 00:47:38,531
- to be the lead vocalist. Yes. - The lead vocalist?

982
00:47:38,531 --> 00:47:42,671
Get rid of everything that tires you out

983
00:47:42,741 --> 00:47:46,011
Such gestures, such gazes

984
00:47:46,281 --> 00:47:49,750
Aren't you sick of this old style?

985
00:47:50,111 --> 00:47:54,681
- Okay. Let's stop there. - Okay.

986
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:59,790
(Hyerin tries out to be the lead vocalist after Yoona.)

987
00:47:59,991 --> 00:48:01,390
The lead vocalist is...

988
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:03,290
- Hyerin. - Okay.

989
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:07,230
(Yoona wasn't chosen for the lead vocalist.)

990
00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:08,460
Next. The sub vocalist will be...

991
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:09,870
- Chaewon - Okay.

992
00:48:09,931 --> 00:48:11,230
That's what we decided.

993
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:12,640
(Chaewon who wasn't chosen either becomes a sub vocalist.)

994
00:48:14,241 --> 00:48:15,310
What's wrong?

995
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:18,040
- No. Why are you crying? - What's wrong?

996
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:19,741
- Why are you crying? - Why... You're...

997
00:48:19,881 --> 00:48:21,681
I'm sorry.

998
00:48:21,681 --> 00:48:23,350
- Why did you do that? - Seriously.

999
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:25,151
- It's okay. - Things didn't go...

1000
00:48:25,151 --> 00:48:26,921
- the way she wanted. - Then...

1001
00:48:27,681 --> 00:48:33,020
I really want to make an impression on the Unicorns.

1002
00:48:33,890 --> 00:48:37,091
So I wanted to become the lead vocalist.

1003
00:48:37,361 --> 00:48:38,861
It was upsetting.

1004
00:48:38,861 --> 00:48:41,931
I really worked hard when I practiced singing the song.

1005
00:48:42,171 --> 00:48:45,171
But I might have practiced way too much.

1006
00:48:45,201 --> 00:48:47,671
When I woke up this morning,

1007
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:49,770
I felt that my voice was a bit hoarse.

1008
00:48:50,471 --> 00:48:52,710
I shouldn't have practiced too much yesterday.

1009
00:48:56,310 --> 00:48:59,181
Next, we have the highlight. Does anyone want to try it out?

1010
00:49:00,821 --> 00:49:02,250
(Everyone is surprised when Kotoko volunteers.)

1011
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:03,551
Kotoko.

1012
00:49:03,551 --> 00:49:05,091
- Yes. - Kotoko.

1013
00:49:06,261 --> 00:49:11,730
(This highlight was added as the song was newly arranged.)

1014
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:14,230
I'll be by your side

1015
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:19,071
To you

1016
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:22,540
She looks like a studious student.

1017
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,410
Great. Nice.

1018
00:49:25,611 --> 00:49:26,681
Well done.

1019
00:49:26,681 --> 00:49:30,381
You were flipping through the pages to sing. I found that so funny.

1020
00:49:30,681 --> 00:49:32,451
It was so cute, so I laughed.

1021
00:49:33,451 --> 00:49:35,151
(When the rest of them practiced with the printout,)

1022
00:49:35,151 --> 00:49:36,850
(only she studied with her notebook.)

1023
00:49:36,850 --> 00:49:40,160
I listened to the song carefully.

1024
00:49:40,221 --> 00:49:45,131
Then I wrote down the pronunciation of the lyrics in my notebook.

1025
00:49:45,230 --> 00:49:47,131
Okay. Right here like this.

1026
00:49:47,801 --> 00:49:54,140
I studied the lyrics until 3am.

1027
00:49:55,171 --> 00:49:56,341
The highlight goes to...

1028
00:49:56,971 --> 00:49:58,111
Kotoko.

1029
00:49:58,640 --> 00:49:59,910
Thank you.

1030
00:50:00,241 --> 00:50:02,511
Kotoko. In my opinion, she is...

1031
00:50:02,511 --> 00:50:04,181
one hardworking girl.

1032
00:50:04,181 --> 00:50:06,821
She doesn't have a booming voice. But given her voice,

1033
00:50:06,881 --> 00:50:08,991
she was very close to pulling off the highlight.

1034
00:50:09,321 --> 00:50:12,560
I thought that she'd excel a lot if we taught her a bit.

1035
00:50:12,690 --> 00:50:16,531
I saw infinite potential for her to grow as a singer.

1036
00:50:20,361 --> 00:50:25,370
(Kotoko is also working hard to practice the choreography.)

1037
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:28,201
You're a superstar

1038
00:50:28,201 --> 00:50:29,870
Hello.

1039
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:32,241
- Hello. - Hello.

1040
00:50:32,241 --> 00:50:35,011
I'm a Pilates instructor. My name is Baek Ji Yeon.

1041
00:50:35,011 --> 00:50:37,210
It's nice to meet you all.

1042
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:39,881
(This is a special class for those with a lack of foundation.)

1043
00:50:39,881 --> 00:50:43,250
I'm going to analyze your body types today...

1044
00:50:43,350 --> 00:50:47,221
to find out what you lack and what you need to improve.

1045
00:50:47,221 --> 00:50:49,460
I'll take a look at everyone's body types one at a time.

1046
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:51,431
Sua. It's your knees. On top of that,

1047
00:50:51,431 --> 00:50:53,361
I bet you have internally rotated hip joints too.

1048
00:50:53,361 --> 00:50:55,471
- I do. - You do.

1049
00:50:55,770 --> 00:50:57,330
You too, Kotoko. Your weight is on your heels.

1050
00:50:57,330 --> 00:50:58,901
- Yes. - Your ears...

1051
00:50:58,901 --> 00:51:01,140
Kotoko, you have rounded shoulders.

1052
00:51:01,971 --> 00:51:03,640
Kotoko. You have rounded shoulders.

1053
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,480
Step on the middle of this.

1054
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:06,881
(Their focused sessions differ based on their body types.)

1055
00:51:06,881 --> 00:51:09,250
All right. Standing on top of them...

1056
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:11,511
on your own like this will be enough for an exercise.

1057
00:51:12,051 --> 00:51:14,120
One. Bring your legs in.

1058
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:16,690
(They build their foundation to improve their performances.)

1059
00:51:16,790 --> 00:51:19,190
Your calves are being stretched.

1060
00:51:19,321 --> 00:51:21,620
Think of it as rolling down the foam roller.

1061
00:51:21,721 --> 00:51:23,131
All the way. You can feel...

1062
00:51:23,131 --> 00:51:24,531
your left side getting stretched, right?

1063
00:51:24,531 --> 00:51:25,531
Come on. Hurry.

1064
00:51:25,531 --> 00:51:27,730
All right. This is the last one.

1065
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:29,770
Okay. The last one.

1066
00:51:31,131 --> 00:51:32,901
Let's finish the last one.

1067
00:51:32,901 --> 00:51:37,341
(She works harder than anyone to build a strong foundation.)

1068
00:51:37,471 --> 00:51:39,241
(After strengthening their foundation,)

1069
00:51:39,611 --> 00:51:43,011
(Team Twinkle starts their vocal lesson.)

1070
00:51:43,011 --> 00:51:44,710
- Chaewon, let's start with you. - Okay.

1071
00:51:44,781 --> 00:51:46,681
Forget it

1072
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:48,080
Can you sing without the vibrato?

1073
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,620
Forget it

1074
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:51,290
Instead of bending your pronunciation,

1075
00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:52,591
- keep it simple and plain. - Okay.

1076
00:51:52,591 --> 00:51:53,921
- That will suit you better. - Okay.

1077
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:55,861
Lose yourself from time to time

1078
00:51:55,861 --> 00:51:57,660
That too. Why don't you sing without bending the last note?

1079
00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:00,701
(Chaewon's singing method is holding her back.)

1080
00:52:01,230 --> 00:52:03,000
I thought that it didn't sound that awful.

1081
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,770
To tell you the truth,

1082
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:09,571
I didn't fix my singing habits. So I have bad singing habits.

1083
00:52:09,870 --> 00:52:11,671
- All right. - Chaewon.

1084
00:52:11,671 --> 00:52:13,480
I'll be completely honest about her.

1085
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:16,381
- She has a lot of bad habits. - Yes.

1086
00:52:16,381 --> 00:52:20,781
I'm not sure if she'd be able to fix those habits.

1087
00:52:20,781 --> 00:52:23,591
How should we help her fix that? Gosh, Chaewon.

1088
00:52:23,591 --> 00:52:25,451
Someone has to sit her down and fix her habit.

1089
00:52:25,451 --> 00:52:26,560
- It's really hard. - Yes.

1090
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:28,660
- We'll do it after five minutes. - Okay.

1091
00:52:29,591 --> 00:52:33,730
(In the end, the vocal coach separately calls Chaewon.)

1092
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:38,370
I mean, I had been singing like this for the past several years.

1093
00:52:38,370 --> 00:52:40,100
It wasn't easy to fix my singing style.

1094
00:52:41,341 --> 00:52:42,370
Let's try one more time.

1095
00:52:42,370 --> 00:52:44,410
- Forget it - Forget it

1096
00:52:44,471 --> 00:52:45,471
Let's try it again. Go.

1097
00:52:45,471 --> 00:52:47,341
(She still couldn't fix her habit the next day either.)

1098
00:52:47,341 --> 00:52:49,951
Not yet. Fix the first note. You can do this. Try it again.

1099
00:52:52,321 --> 00:52:54,020
- You can do this! - Are you okay?

1100
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:58,051
I thought I had to fix this habit, so I really worked hard to fix it.

1101
00:52:58,051 --> 00:52:59,620
I tried to remove all of my habits and sing it...

1102
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:01,190
like it was a children's song.

1103
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:03,190
I shouldn't have cried in there.

1104
00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:06,201
But I kept finding myself in situations that made me cry.

1105
00:53:07,431 --> 00:53:09,100
One, two, three, four.

1106
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:10,701
Do we start on 5 or 6?

1107
00:53:11,531 --> 00:53:13,401
(After losing her confidence, she can't focus on the practice.)

1108
00:53:13,401 --> 00:53:14,971
- One. - We probably did that on one.

1109
00:53:14,971 --> 00:53:17,111
- Four, five, six. One. - One?

1110
00:53:17,210 --> 00:53:19,140
Forget

1111
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:20,710
- Your difficult days - Our positions aren't aligned.

1112
00:53:22,850 --> 00:53:24,511
Our positions aren't aligned correctly.

1113
00:53:24,511 --> 00:53:25,681
But we should...

1114
00:53:28,551 --> 00:53:29,551
We...

1115
00:53:31,651 --> 00:53:35,460
Our leader seemed to be struggling a lot.

1116
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:39,000
At first, I thought, "What are we going to do?"

1117
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,330
Should I move here? Or...

1118
00:53:42,330 --> 00:53:44,100
- Is this it? Aren't they different? - You have to move in.

1119
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:46,040
- I have to move in? - Nako has to step out.

1120
00:53:46,701 --> 00:53:48,401
Why do I feel like nothing is working out?

1121
00:53:51,471 --> 00:53:54,011
I showed my weak side to the members of my team.

1122
00:53:54,281 --> 00:53:56,750
I pretended not to be affected by that.

1123
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:59,651
But to be honest, I was very angry at myself.

1124
00:54:01,721 --> 00:54:06,321
(They begin the dance lesson when they're not fully ready.)

1125
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,821
You guys have to look cheerful and energetic.

1126
00:54:08,821 --> 00:54:11,230
But all of your dance moves look sloppy.

1127
00:54:11,230 --> 00:54:13,060
If this is all the energy you can show them,

1128
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:14,660
you're bound to lose.

1129
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,171
This might look like a talent show at some school.

1130
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:19,171
- You know? - Yes.

1131
00:54:19,741 --> 00:54:23,540
It felt like we might end up losing if we didn't change things around.

1132
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:27,580
If we lose, I might get eliminated.

1133
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:29,910
So I'm scared.

1134
00:54:30,281 --> 00:54:32,850
By the way, I was meaning to ask you this.

1135
00:54:33,051 --> 00:54:34,221
When we do this dance move...

1136
00:54:34,221 --> 00:54:35,890
As we circle our arms one and a half times,

1137
00:54:35,890 --> 00:54:37,591
we should slow down our arms...

1138
00:54:37,591 --> 00:54:38,951
and then do a bigger body roll.

1139
00:54:38,951 --> 00:54:40,290
That way, our move will stand out more.

1140
00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:42,160
Nako, you face forward when you do the body roll.

1141
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:43,491
- You do it like this. - Yes.

1142
00:54:43,491 --> 00:54:44,890
Don't let your chest face forward.

1143
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:46,960
Don't adjust the angle of your shoulders.

1144
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,861
Just lean back when you do the body roll.

1145
00:54:49,431 --> 00:54:51,431
Yes. But there's no need to make the movement look so big.

1146
00:54:51,431 --> 00:54:53,370
I thought, "What's this?"

1147
00:54:53,370 --> 00:54:54,640
The body roll...

1148
00:54:54,870 --> 00:54:59,011
If I were to volunteer to be the leader from the get-go,

1149
00:54:59,381 --> 00:55:01,781
we could have fine-tuned the choreography faster.

1150
00:55:02,681 --> 00:55:05,580
I could have spoken up faster. That crossed my mind.

1151
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:06,620
For some reason...

1152
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:09,721
Getting eliminated?

1153
00:55:10,290 --> 00:55:12,250
I really don't want to be eliminated.

1154
00:55:13,591 --> 00:55:15,491
I can't go back now.

1155
00:55:16,091 --> 00:55:17,861
This is the only path I have left.

1156
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:20,531
I don't want anyone in my team to get eliminated.

1157
00:55:23,230 --> 00:55:26,301
(They get on the stage, unable to wash away their anxiety.)

1158
00:55:26,301 --> 00:55:29,310
Yes, some people will be eliminated today.

1159
00:55:29,671 --> 00:55:31,370
But today's performance won't be your last one.

1160
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:33,881
We will see each other again on another stage, right?

1161
00:55:33,881 --> 00:55:37,381
So make sure you leave no regret for today's performance.

1162
00:55:37,511 --> 00:55:39,221
Fully enjoy the energy of the performance.

1163
00:55:39,321 --> 00:55:40,620
So what if you need to improve?

1164
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:42,890
Think of it as your last chance on this show.

1165
00:55:43,091 --> 00:55:44,991
I hope you will fully express yourself on stage today.

1166
00:55:44,991 --> 00:55:46,361
Don't lose your energy. You got this.

1167
00:55:46,361 --> 00:55:47,390
- Okay. - Good luck.

1168
00:55:47,390 --> 00:55:49,060
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1169
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:50,190
Good luck. I mean it.

1170
00:55:51,330 --> 00:55:52,330
Here they go.

1171
00:55:55,931 --> 00:55:58,471
- With a lot of energy. - Let's do this, everyone.

1172
00:55:58,531 --> 00:55:59,770
Are we in the center?

1173
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:01,100
- Yes. - Okay.

1174
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:02,100
We are.

1175
00:56:02,301 --> 00:56:03,410
I'm nervous for them.

1176
00:56:04,171 --> 00:56:05,270
I'm so nervous.

1177

1178
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:13,551
(Show us everything you've got, so you won't leave any regrets.)

1179
00:56:18,390 --> 00:56:19,761
Her blond hair is shining.

1180
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:23,091
They look beautiful.

1181

("Superstar" by Kwon Chaewon, Kim Sumin, Nako, Oh Yoona,)

1182
00:56:30,431 --> 00:56:32,540
(Choi Hyerin, and Kotoko)

1183
00:57:00,761 --> 00:57:01,761
She's so cute!

1184
00:57:24,390 --> 00:57:25,451
They're so cute.

1185
00:57:52,111 --> 00:57:53,580
Oh, my!

1186
00:58:05,901 --> 00:58:06,901
She's good!

1187
00:58:55,741 --> 00:58:56,881
I think I'm going to tear up.

1188
00:58:57,651 --> 00:58:58,710
I'm tearing up.

1189
00:58:58,710 --> 00:59:00,321
This is so emotional.

1190
00:59:38,151 --> 00:59:40,160
- That was so cool. - That was cool.

1191
00:59:40,491 --> 00:59:42,060
- I'm getting teary-eyed. - I loved it.

1192
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:43,931
- Seriously. - By the way, was it live?

1193
00:59:43,931 --> 00:59:45,060
- It was live, right? - Yes.

1194
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:46,431
- They did well. - They were great.

1195
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:48,560
- They must've practiced a lot. - Totally.

1196
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:49,631
They were determined.

1197
00:59:58,011 --> 00:59:59,381
How much longer will you hold the ending pose?

1198
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:01,040
I guess they have to keep holding it.

1199
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:03,051
All right. Get up. It's okay to get up now.

1200
01:00:03,051 --> 01:00:04,181
You can get up now.

1201
01:00:06,781 --> 01:00:08,421
Well done.

1202
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:11,991
The group energy was great.

1203
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:13,921
- Right. - Their energy was great.

1204
01:00:14,321 --> 01:00:15,460
- Seriously. - Indeed.

1205
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:16,861
You didn't have to feel insecure.

1206
01:00:16,861 --> 01:00:18,660
Your performance was great. I mean it.

1207
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:20,560
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1208
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:25,600
Sumin. You started off the performance.

1209
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:28,500
Your facial expressions and singing were solid.

1210
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:33,011
Thanks to that, you kept grabbing my attention.

1211
01:00:33,710 --> 01:00:35,881
I noticed that you grew a lot as a performer.

1212
01:00:36,410 --> 01:00:37,681
Thank you.

1213
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:42,281
Yoona. First of all, I know that...

1214
01:00:42,281 --> 01:00:44,890
you're a great vocalist.

1215
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:46,520
To have a more suitable voice to rap,

1216
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:48,761
you must have a strong vocal foundation.

1217
01:00:48,761 --> 01:00:49,861
That's what I heard.

1218
01:00:49,861 --> 01:00:53,160
That must be why. Even the rap part suited you very well.

1219
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:54,660
- You nailed it. - Thank you.

1220
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:56,301
Sure. You pulled it off nicely.

1221
01:00:57,531 --> 01:01:00,071
- Kotoko. For this performance, - Yes.

1222
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:03,011
you were responsible for more parts than expected.

1223
01:01:03,011 --> 01:01:04,040
Right.

1224
01:01:04,770 --> 01:01:09,750
(Kotoko was in charge of the highlight.)

1225
01:01:10,551 --> 01:01:13,051
Of course, I can't say that you were perfect.

1226
01:01:13,250 --> 01:01:14,980
But it didn't look like...

1227
01:01:14,980 --> 01:01:16,721
you were struggling or hesitant to perform.

1228
01:01:16,890 --> 01:01:19,120
I could tell that you worked as hard as you could...

1229
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:20,761
for this performance.

1230
01:01:20,761 --> 01:01:24,690
I wanted to tell you I was proud of you and impressed by that.

1231
01:01:25,431 --> 01:01:28,000
Actually, I have a lot to share.

1232
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Just to add to what you said about Kotoko,

1233
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
I should mention the day we assigned the parts.

1234
01:01:32,531 --> 01:01:33,971
She wrote down the pronunciation of the lyrics...

1235
01:01:33,971 --> 01:01:36,171
in Japanese on her notebook...

1236
01:01:36,171 --> 01:01:38,341
and practiced the pronunciation until late the night before.

1237
01:01:38,341 --> 01:01:40,410
She diligently prepared for this performance.

1238
01:01:40,410 --> 01:01:42,281
So for her, this performance was...

1239
01:01:43,111 --> 01:01:45,051
Why are you crying?

1240
01:01:45,051 --> 01:01:47,520
Don't cry. You did a great job.

1241
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:50,690
- Kotoko. - Don't cry.

1242
01:01:51,350 --> 01:01:53,091
She cries like a baby.

1243
01:01:55,221 --> 01:01:57,230
- Don't cry. - Okay.

1244
01:02:02,401 --> 01:02:04,071
Kotoko.

1245
01:02:04,071 --> 01:02:05,770
You have this charm...

1246
01:02:05,770 --> 01:02:07,471
that puts people in a good mood when they simply look at you.

1247
01:02:07,471 --> 01:02:09,940
It's something neither you can buy with money...

1248
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:11,640
nor work hard to get.

1249
01:02:12,241 --> 01:02:14,080
Of course, I see some improvement...

1250
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:15,881
in terms of your dancing and performance.

1251
01:02:16,111 --> 01:02:18,011
But I did think that you would benefit a lot...

1252
01:02:18,011 --> 01:02:19,921
from practicing your breathing technique.

1253
01:02:19,921 --> 01:02:22,750
It will be great if you can practice that too.

1254
01:02:30,190 --> 01:02:33,531
I choked up when I was watching you, Chaewon.

1255
01:02:38,201 --> 01:02:41,870
I'll just share what I felt. Earlier before the performance,

1256
01:02:41,870 --> 01:02:43,511
I told you to fire it up...

1257
01:02:43,511 --> 01:02:45,810
even if this were to be your last performance on the show.

1258
01:02:45,810 --> 01:02:49,710
You did what I asked better than anyone on your team.

1259
01:02:49,710 --> 01:02:51,611
That must have been why I felt emotionally connected.

1260
01:02:54,281 --> 01:02:55,520
Gosh, she's crying again.

1261
01:02:55,721 --> 01:02:57,190
Don't cry.

1262
01:02:59,690 --> 01:03:02,091
- Don't cry. - Don't cry.

1263
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:06,261
I noticed you a lot during this performance.

1264
01:03:06,261 --> 01:03:07,261
- Okay. - I did.

1265
01:03:07,261 --> 01:03:08,261
Thank you.

1266
01:03:12,701 --> 01:03:14,701
I wanted to give a round of applause...

1267
01:03:14,701 --> 01:03:16,710
to everyone here for a job well done.

1268
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:18,040
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1269
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:19,071
Well done.

1270
01:03:19,071 --> 01:03:20,440
- Well done. - Well done.

1271
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:21,440
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1272
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:23,051
- Well done. - Thank you.

1273
01:03:25,410 --> 01:03:28,020
"Has Kotoko's singing always been this solid?"

1274
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:29,080
- That crossed my mind too... - Right.

1275
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:30,620
- even if her pitch was a bit shaky. - Right.

1276
01:03:31,190 --> 01:03:33,960
Actually, here's why I said I was proud of her.

1277
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:35,421
I was proud of her because I noticed that she improved...

1278
01:03:35,421 --> 01:03:36,861
- even after this. - Right.

1279
01:03:36,861 --> 01:03:37,960
- I agree. Right? - Yes.

1280
01:03:39,131 --> 01:03:42,500
Next. Come up to the stage, Team Attention.

1281
01:03:43,701 --> 01:03:44,901
- Gosh. - Really?

1282
01:03:44,901 --> 01:03:46,000
(Let's go, Team Attention.)

1283
01:03:46,471 --> 01:03:48,071
- We'll finally get to watch them. - It's their turn at last.

1284
01:03:48,071 --> 01:03:50,011
I can't wait to watch their performance.

1285
01:03:50,011 --> 01:03:51,640
- Hello. - Hello.

1286
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:53,710
- Hello. - Hello.

1287
01:03:53,710 --> 01:03:54,741
- They look cool. - Gosh.

1288
01:03:55,910 --> 01:03:57,151
I'm getting really curious.

1289
01:03:58,580 --> 01:04:01,051
(Producers from PAPERMAKER: Samuel Ku, EB, TENZO)

1290
01:04:03,620 --> 01:04:04,690
Team Attention.

1291
01:04:04,821 --> 01:04:05,890
- Yes. - Yes.

1292
01:04:05,890 --> 01:04:09,020
What did you think of the performance of Team Twinkle?

1293
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:10,730
Well,

1294
01:04:10,730 --> 01:04:12,790
I was really looking forward to it,

1295
01:04:12,790 --> 01:04:15,801
but their performance may not have been...

1296
01:04:15,801 --> 01:04:18,830
as impressive as I expected.

1297
01:04:18,830 --> 01:04:20,701
We'll give a more powerful performance...

1298
01:04:20,701 --> 01:04:23,440
and make you forget all about it.

1299
01:04:26,710 --> 01:04:29,011
(That's bold.)

1300
01:04:29,011 --> 01:04:31,750
- Oh, boy. - That's intimidating.

1301
01:04:31,750 --> 01:04:33,350
Let's say you guys have won.

1302
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:37,091
Who among you think you'll win a Unicorn Ticket?

1303
01:04:38,421 --> 01:04:39,591
(All of them raise their hands.)

1304
01:04:39,591 --> 01:04:40,921
All of them raised their hands.

1305
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:42,591
(They seem very confident.)

1306
01:04:42,591 --> 01:04:44,861
- Their hands went straight up. - That's cool.

1307
01:04:44,861 --> 01:04:45,991
(They seem very confident.)

1308
01:04:46,361 --> 01:04:48,600
People like us are in the average group?

1309
01:04:49,330 --> 01:04:52,531
I mean, I think we're the kind of people that others would...

1310
01:04:52,531 --> 01:04:54,600
wonder why we were put in the average group.

1311
01:04:55,571 --> 01:04:57,571
And I'm not worried about anything,

1312
01:04:58,171 --> 01:04:59,910
such as the job assignment.

1313
01:05:00,181 --> 01:05:03,281
No matter who takes which part,

1314
01:05:03,451 --> 01:05:06,080
we'll all be able to pull it off.

1315
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:07,120
(They're a group of talented girls.)

1316
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:09,221
So you know, I'm not worried.

1317
01:05:09,321 --> 01:05:10,951
Frankly, we don't belong in the average group.

1318
01:05:13,091 --> 01:05:15,020
We all feel like we were underrated.

1319
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:22,560
(Gabi took the Level Test together with Lim Seowon.)

1320
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:24,370
Gabi fell a little short, right?

1321
01:05:24,370 --> 01:05:25,531
- Yes. - Yes.

1322
01:05:26,571 --> 01:05:29,040
"Was I that bad?"

1323
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:31,040
"What did I do wrong?"

1324
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:33,011
I had questions like these.

1325
01:05:33,381 --> 01:05:35,741
When I was put in the average group,

1326
01:05:35,741 --> 01:05:37,310
I wasn't satisfied.

1327
01:05:37,310 --> 01:05:40,151
I'm going to try and make them regret putting me...

1328
01:05:40,151 --> 01:05:41,850
in the average group.

1329
01:05:42,721 --> 01:05:45,091
What I'm actually worried about is...

1330
01:05:45,350 --> 01:05:49,120
who will get the promotion.

1331
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:51,730
That's more important to us...

1332
01:05:51,730 --> 01:05:52,890
because I'm sure we'll win,

1333
01:05:52,890 --> 01:05:55,431
and the competition for the promotion is going to be...

1334
01:05:55,431 --> 01:05:56,671
- You're right. - really tough here.

1335
01:05:56,801 --> 01:05:58,730
- Everyone here is so good. - Yes.

1336
01:05:58,730 --> 01:06:02,841
I thought I should pull out all stops to do a good job.

1337
01:06:02,940 --> 01:06:05,440
I don't think I will be eliminated.

1338
01:06:05,511 --> 01:06:06,940
I feel really confident.

1339
01:06:06,940 --> 01:06:09,640
Who do I find intimidating? There's none.

1340
01:06:09,980 --> 01:06:13,281
I think we'll be able to give a great performance as a team,

1341
01:06:13,281 --> 01:06:15,951
but what do I need to do to make sure I stand out?

1342
01:06:15,951 --> 01:06:18,991
That's my biggest concern here.

1343
01:06:19,290 --> 01:06:22,520
Let's go around and say which part of the song we want to do.

1344
01:06:22,660 --> 01:06:23,931
Well, I...

1345
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:25,991
want to do the highlight.

1346
01:06:25,991 --> 01:06:27,431
- The highlight? - The highlight.

1347
01:06:27,761 --> 01:06:28,901
Part number one.

1348
01:06:28,901 --> 01:06:30,071
Part number one or...

1349
01:06:30,071 --> 01:06:31,770
Number 1 or 3.

1350
01:06:31,770 --> 01:06:32,931
Same. Number 1 or 3.

1351
01:06:32,931 --> 01:06:34,440
Number 1 or 3? I see.

1352
01:06:35,270 --> 01:06:42,640
(The highlight is where the song begins.)

1353
01:06:42,710 --> 01:06:45,580
I guess there's going to be a fierce competition.

1354
01:06:46,421 --> 01:06:48,781
I really want to do the highlight.

1355
01:06:49,421 --> 01:06:52,551
I know I can do the dance really well,

1356
01:06:52,721 --> 01:06:55,491
and I think I will be good for the part.

1357
01:06:55,491 --> 01:06:59,531
I think singing is my strong suit,

1358
01:06:59,761 --> 01:07:03,031
so if I'm lucky, I might be able to get the part.

1359
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:07,301
I think I can do a better job than anyone...

1360
01:07:07,671 --> 01:07:10,440
with the dance for the intro which is the highlight.

1361
01:07:10,741 --> 01:07:12,710
I feel pretty confident.

1362
01:07:13,580 --> 01:07:16,511
(Who will get to do the highlight?)

1363
01:07:16,951 --> 01:07:19,951
(The next day at the PAPERMAKER studio)

1364
01:07:19,951 --> 01:07:21,221
Have you guys checked out the song?

1365
01:07:21,221 --> 01:07:22,681
- Yes. - What did you think?

1366
01:07:22,681 --> 01:07:24,821
- We love it. - We love it.

1367
01:07:24,821 --> 01:07:27,091
Is there a certain part you want to do?

1368
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:28,491
Anyone?

1369
01:07:28,491 --> 01:07:30,361
- Yes. - We all have one.

1370
01:07:30,361 --> 01:07:31,890
- You all have one? Good. - Yes.

1371
01:07:31,890 --> 01:07:33,201
Let's hear you sing 1 by 1 then.

1372
01:07:33,201 --> 01:07:34,261
- Okay. - Okay.

1373
01:07:34,761 --> 01:07:36,531
(Nervous)

1374
01:07:36,671 --> 01:07:37,730
I'm nervous.

1375
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:41,100
- All right, are you ready? - Yes.

1376
01:07:41,370 --> 01:07:43,940
- Let's give it a try. From the top. - Okay.

1377
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:47,980
(Candidate number 1 for the highlight, Jeon Jinyeong)

1378
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:49,480
(Candidate number 2 for the highlight, Bae Haram)

1379
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:51,881
(Candidate number 3 for the highlight, Goo Gyoryeon)

1380
01:07:51,881 --> 01:07:55,921
(Candidate number 4 for the highlight, Gabi)

1381
01:07:55,921 --> 01:08:00,261
(Candidate number 5 for the highlight, Nana)

1382
01:08:00,761 --> 01:08:04,761
(Who will be assigned to the highlight?)

1383
01:08:04,761 --> 01:08:05,790
All right.

1384
01:08:06,131 --> 01:08:09,660
We've assigned you to your parts through discussion.

1385
01:08:09,801 --> 01:08:12,870
It was the most difficult to decide who'll do the highlight.

1386
01:08:13,870 --> 01:08:15,740
I really want to do the highlight.

1387
01:08:18,570 --> 01:08:19,610
The highlight.

1388
01:08:20,481 --> 01:08:23,750
(The highlight is assigned to...)

1389
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:24,750
Gabi will do it.

1390
01:08:26,011 --> 01:08:27,280
Thank you.

1391
01:08:27,950 --> 01:08:31,021
I got the highlight,

1392
01:08:31,021 --> 01:08:32,521
and I was really happy.

1393
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:35,561
I was sad I didn't get it.

1394
01:08:35,990 --> 01:08:38,431
Gabi. You're a good singer, but you're young and inexperienced.

1395
01:08:38,431 --> 01:08:40,960
If you put in more work, I'm sure you'll be amazing.

1396
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:42,601
- I like your voice. - Thank you.

1397
01:08:42,601 --> 01:08:43,900
Nana.

1398
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:46,870
I hear you're a good performer,

1399
01:08:46,870 --> 01:08:49,040
but you didn't sound so confident when you were singing.

1400
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:50,610
If you work on that,

1401
01:08:50,610 --> 01:08:53,381
you'll stand out more in your performance.

1402
01:08:53,381 --> 01:08:55,311
- Okay. - I hope you'll work hard...

1403
01:08:55,311 --> 01:08:57,681
- until the recording. - Yes.

1404
01:09:01,150 --> 01:09:05,351
We've been assigned to our parts for "Girls On Top."

1405
01:09:07,421 --> 01:09:12,131
The part I wanted to do was the highlight,

1406
01:09:12,330 --> 01:09:16,771
but they assigned Gabi to it.

1407
01:09:17,601 --> 01:09:19,570
Yes. So...

1408
01:09:19,771 --> 01:09:22,971
when I went back to the dorm,

1409
01:09:23,610 --> 01:09:24,671
I cried.

1410
01:09:25,740 --> 01:09:28,381
Although I didn't get the highlight,

1411
01:09:28,511 --> 01:09:31,011
I'm going to work really hard...

1412
01:09:31,011 --> 01:09:33,851
to turn my own part into the highlight.

1413
01:09:34,181 --> 01:09:36,820
You can do it, Nana.

1414
01:09:37,150 --> 01:09:38,250
Let's go.

1415
01:09:39,221 --> 01:09:43,431
- Hi, I have a question. - Yes?

1416
01:09:43,631 --> 01:09:45,860
- When the rhythm changes, - That's right.

1417
01:09:45,860 --> 01:09:48,101
I have trouble keeping...

1418
01:09:48,101 --> 01:09:49,660
- my balance. - You do? Okay.

1419
01:09:50,070 --> 01:09:53,030
(She also asks the vocal coach for advice after the lesson.)

1420
01:09:53,801 --> 01:09:58,410
(After hearing that she lacks confidence in her singing,)

1421
01:09:58,671 --> 01:10:02,681
(Nana is working hard to improve her weaknesses.)

1422
01:10:02,881 --> 01:10:04,381
Can anyone do the kick?

1423
01:10:05,851 --> 01:10:07,750
The kick. Can you do it?

1424
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:09,120
Seven and eight.

1425
01:10:09,750 --> 01:10:10,891
That's it.

1426
01:10:10,891 --> 01:10:12,391
(Nana got herself a new part too.)

1427
01:10:12,391 --> 01:10:13,960
- You've got long legs. - That's cool.

1428
01:10:14,721 --> 01:10:17,391
I didn't get the Unicorn Ticket before,

1429
01:10:17,391 --> 01:10:19,131
and I was really sad about it.

1430
01:10:19,131 --> 01:10:21,631
So as for the next performance,

1431
01:10:21,631 --> 01:10:26,030
I really want to own it.

1432
01:10:26,030 --> 01:10:30,141
I want to impress everyone with my performance of "Girls On Top."

1433
01:10:33,941 --> 01:10:37,080
We saw our practice video, and from Nana's facial expressions,

1434
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:39,610
I could see that she's really going all out for this.

1435
01:10:39,610 --> 01:10:42,650
She's more determined than anyone...

1436
01:10:42,650 --> 01:10:44,820
to work hard and pull this off.

1437
01:10:45,091 --> 01:10:47,891
She's probably the most tenacious person on the team.

1438
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:52,290
(Their practice continues until late at night.)

1439
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:54,860
("Girls On Top," the day of recording)

1440
01:10:55,530 --> 01:10:59,101
(Team Attention is at the recording studio.)

1441
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:02,000
Gabi, you're doing the first part, so let's start with you.

1442
01:11:03,570 --> 01:11:05,441
- Okay. - Let's go, Gabi.

1443
01:11:05,441 --> 01:11:07,011
- We'll go in this order. - Gabi.

1444
01:11:09,580 --> 01:11:11,150
All right, Gabi. Let's start.

1445
01:11:11,150 --> 01:11:12,181
Yes.

1446
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:18,521
Everyone's telling me I should be somebody I don't want to be

1447
01:11:19,191 --> 01:11:20,960
Somebody I don't want to be

1448
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:22,160
Want to be

1449
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:23,631
- Want to be - Want to be

1450
01:11:23,631 --> 01:11:25,761
- Don't bend the note in "want." - Want to be

1451
01:11:25,761 --> 01:11:26,761
Yes, let's try again.

1452
01:11:26,761 --> 01:11:31,101
Everyone's telling me I should be somebody I don't want to be

1453
01:11:31,601 --> 01:11:32,931
It has to be all short.

1454
01:11:33,101 --> 01:11:34,870
Short.

1455
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:36,500
- All the same. Okay? - Okay.

1456
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:39,240
- Be more confident. - Yes.

1457
01:11:39,610 --> 01:11:43,950
Everyone's telling me I should be somebody I don't want to be

1458
01:11:43,950 --> 01:11:45,811
You're going faster. Don't feel rushed.

1459
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:48,280
Listen, Gabi.

1460
01:11:48,580 --> 01:11:50,851
You're probably doing what you can in there,

1461
01:11:50,851 --> 01:11:52,221
but from here,

1462
01:11:52,391 --> 01:11:54,660
it sounds like you're standing still with a blank look without dancing.

1463
01:11:54,660 --> 01:11:56,460
You sound emotionless.

1464
01:11:57,931 --> 01:11:59,091
Everyone

1465
01:11:59,530 --> 01:12:04,870
(Stuck in the first part, they can't proceed with the recording.)

1466
01:12:06,601 --> 01:12:08,400
I don't think she's a good fit for this part.

1467
01:12:09,671 --> 01:12:11,471
- Gabi, you can come out. - Okay.

1468
01:12:11,471 --> 01:12:12,910
(They stop the recording.)

1469
01:12:13,070 --> 01:12:15,181
The problem is that if Gabi can't do the intro,

1470
01:12:15,181 --> 01:12:16,750
she won't be able to do this part either.

1471
01:12:17,710 --> 01:12:19,450
It's not like she doesn't understand the lyrics.

1472
01:12:20,351 --> 01:12:21,650
She clearly can't do the intro.

1473
01:12:21,650 --> 01:12:22,780
It doesn't sound right.

1474
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:29,790
Want to be

1475
01:12:32,990 --> 01:12:35,631
"Want to be."

1476
01:12:36,530 --> 01:12:39,530
Here's the thing. This is not an individual performance.

1477
01:12:39,530 --> 01:12:41,200
- Right. - It's a group performance,

1478
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:43,511
and you should do well as a team.

1479
01:12:43,610 --> 01:12:46,511
To improve your performance, you'll have to switch parts.

1480
01:12:46,671 --> 01:12:48,641
Some of you don't really sound good for your parts.

1481
01:12:48,740 --> 01:12:51,750
We're only doing this so you'll do a better job.

1482
01:12:51,881 --> 01:12:55,120
The lyrics for the intro are repeated later, right?

1483
01:12:55,250 --> 01:12:57,851
I want Nana and Jayla to give it a try.

1484
01:12:57,851 --> 01:12:59,620
I think you have better voices for it.

1485
01:13:00,591 --> 01:13:02,391
- Nana, let's start with you. - Okay.

1486
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:09,460
- From "Everyone's telling me." - Okay.

1487
01:13:11,030 --> 01:13:15,641
(Nana gives the highlight a try.)

1488
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:18,511
- Great. That was nice. - Good job.

1489
01:13:18,511 --> 01:13:21,641
It was good. The vibe and everything.

1490
01:13:22,210 --> 01:13:25,750
The intro, the part I really wanted to do,

1491
01:13:25,750 --> 01:13:27,881
was reassigned to Nana.

1492
01:13:29,721 --> 01:13:33,460
I couldn't help but wonder if I had done a bad job,

1493
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:35,591
and I was upset...

1494
01:13:35,591 --> 01:13:37,761
that I blew my chance.

1495
01:13:38,660 --> 01:13:40,330
It already happened. There's no going back.

1496
01:13:40,330 --> 01:13:42,530
Just try and do a good job with your new part.

1497
01:13:44,771 --> 01:13:48,870
That's the part I wanted the most,

1498
01:13:48,870 --> 01:13:49,870
and I...

1499
01:13:50,671 --> 01:13:53,311
was really happy to get it.

1500
01:13:53,441 --> 01:13:56,181
Some of us were reassigned to different parts unexpectedly.

1501
01:13:56,181 --> 01:13:57,811
I was a bit scared.

1502
01:13:57,881 --> 01:13:59,450
Another change might bring chaos.

1503
01:14:00,221 --> 01:14:03,620
We have to compete against one another within the team as well.

1504
01:14:03,620 --> 01:14:07,721
I have to make myself stand out to survive.

1505
01:14:07,761 --> 01:14:10,490
All I could think about was that I have to do...

1506
01:14:10,490 --> 01:14:13,290
everything in my power to give a good performance.

1507
01:14:14,561 --> 01:14:18,671
(The competition for the promotion has become even fiercer.)

1508
01:14:19,431 --> 01:14:22,171
(While everyone is busy practicing,)

1509
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:28,110
(Gabi looks at her phone the whole time.)

1510
01:14:29,011 --> 01:14:33,011
Since Gabi was reassigned to a different part,

1511
01:14:33,011 --> 01:14:36,280
she's been looking a little demotivated.

1512
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:37,721
Sometimes,

1513
01:14:37,721 --> 01:14:40,120
she just ignores us and looks at her phone.

1514
01:14:40,290 --> 01:14:42,120
Does anyone want to have some snacks?

1515
01:14:43,530 --> 01:14:45,290
Let's have them later, Gabi.

1516
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:49,200
She was looking at her phone while having a snack.

1517
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:50,700
(During the practice)

1518
01:14:50,801 --> 01:14:53,700
Everyone was tiptoeing around her.

1519
01:14:54,341 --> 01:14:55,870
(The dance practice begins,)

1520
01:14:55,870 --> 01:14:57,240
(but it's soon put to a stop.)

1521
01:14:58,271 --> 01:14:59,570
And stop.

1522
01:15:00,011 --> 01:15:02,811
Gabi, you need to turn on the spot.

1523
01:15:02,910 --> 01:15:08,080
She seemed distracted when we were practicing together.

1524
01:15:08,421 --> 01:15:10,080
- Let's try the chorus, shall we? - Yes.

1525
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:11,191
Gabi got it wrong.

1526
01:15:11,250 --> 01:15:13,990
(She got the moves wrong, but all she does is smile.)

1527
01:15:14,790 --> 01:15:18,391
(She even walks out of the room in the middle of the practice.)

1528
01:15:18,530 --> 01:15:21,330
- What's taking her so long? - Gabi.

1529
01:15:21,601 --> 01:15:23,431
Where's Gabi?

1530
01:15:23,431 --> 01:15:24,500
(Everyone is waiting for her.)

1531
01:15:25,231 --> 01:15:29,370
(They had to proceed without Gabi.)

1532
01:15:30,171 --> 01:15:32,441
If you lose and somebody had to be eliminated,

1533
01:15:32,610 --> 01:15:34,681
who do you think that would be?

1534
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:36,681
Gabi.

1535
01:15:37,011 --> 01:15:38,410
Gabi or...

1536
01:15:39,250 --> 01:15:40,280
Gabi.

1537
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:42,120
I think there's a good chance it'll be Gabi.

1538
01:15:42,551 --> 01:15:44,250
She was very enthusiastic at first,

1539
01:15:44,591 --> 01:15:47,320
but she clearly started to lose her motivation,

1540
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:50,431
judging by the way she acted in the last ten days.

1541
01:15:50,561 --> 01:15:52,131
I wonder what she's thinking.

1542
01:15:58,530 --> 01:15:59,700
Well, it's...

1543
01:16:00,801 --> 01:16:03,710
I'm not tired, but I guess I'm upset.

1544
01:16:04,040 --> 01:16:05,540
What are you upset about?

1545
01:16:06,981 --> 01:16:08,040
It feels like...

1546
01:16:08,941 --> 01:16:10,511
people won't be able to notice me.

1547
01:16:11,780 --> 01:16:13,351
I'm upset about that.

1548
01:16:18,150 --> 01:16:20,591
I'm not demotivated, but it's just that...

1549
01:16:21,790 --> 01:16:24,131
I try to work hard,

1550
01:16:25,660 --> 01:16:28,761
but I can't help but feel sad.

1551
01:16:30,570 --> 01:16:33,941
I guess I might've looked demotivated in their eyes.

1552
01:16:43,981 --> 01:16:45,011
All right then.

1553
01:16:45,011 --> 01:16:47,750
Team Attention, let's see your performance.

1554
01:16:47,820 --> 01:16:48,921
- Okay. - Okay.

1555
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:51,120
- Let's go. - Let's go!

1556
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:52,391
- We got this. - Good luck!

1557
01:16:53,051 --> 01:16:54,191
I'm nervous.

1558
01:16:54,391 --> 01:16:56,320
- Me too. - Why am I nervous?

1559
01:16:57,660 --> 01:16:59,160
I hope they do well.

1560
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:01,431
- Break a leg. - You guys look great.

1561
01:17:01,431 --> 01:17:02,761
They're all so tall.

1562
01:17:02,761 --> 01:17:04,370
I can't wait to see it.

1563
01:17:04,370 --> 01:17:05,900
It already looks like they'll win.

1564
01:17:05,900 --> 01:17:08,740
In terms of appearance, they already won.

1565
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,240
I already feel blown away.

1566
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:22,351
How cool.

1567
01:17:23,551 --> 01:17:24,551
I'm excited.

1568
01:17:30,490 --> 01:17:32,561
("Girls On Top" by Gabi, Goo Gyoryeon, Nana,)

1569
01:17:32,561 --> 01:17:34,631
(Bae Haram, Lee Sunwoo, Jeon Jinyeong, and Jayla)

1570
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:50,240
Awesome.

1571
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:54,881
I got goosebumps.

1572
01:18:21,610 --> 01:18:23,681
That's good. Very good.

1573
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:03,921
That's insane!

1574
01:19:35,681 --> 01:19:36,721
They killed it.

1575
01:19:45,490 --> 01:19:46,761
Oh, my gosh.

1576
01:19:56,570 --> 01:19:57,740
Nice!

1577
01:20:25,030 --> 01:20:26,400
- That was incredible. - They killed it.

1578
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:28,671
- I got goosebumps. - That was amazing.

1579
01:20:28,740 --> 01:20:30,240
They were awesome.

1580
01:20:30,641 --> 01:20:31,971
They totally killed it.

1581
01:20:32,671 --> 01:20:34,210
How are they in the average group?

1582
01:20:34,941 --> 01:20:36,610
They're really good.

1583
01:20:43,150 --> 01:20:44,851
- That was insane! - Their energy.

1584
01:20:44,851 --> 01:20:46,921
- They killed it. - I got goosebumps all over.

1585
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:48,320
They killed it.

1586
01:20:48,561 --> 01:20:49,761
Gosh, that was great.

1587
01:20:49,761 --> 01:20:51,530
- I'm overwhelmed with emotions. - I know.

1588
01:20:54,801 --> 01:20:56,731
- That was cool. - The ending.

1589
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:05,171
They were amazing. What do we do?

1590
01:21:06,171 --> 01:21:07,641
What are we going to do?

1591
01:21:07,710 --> 01:21:09,610
What did you think of their performance?

1592
01:21:10,110 --> 01:21:12,250
- I'm overwhelmed with emotions. - Same here.

1593
01:21:12,250 --> 01:21:13,881
They almost made my heart explode.

1594
01:21:15,381 --> 01:21:16,620
What do we do?

1595
01:21:16,981 --> 01:21:20,250
They performed like they were a group that has released...

1596
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:22,360
- a few albums together already. - Yes.

1597
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:24,131
They had such great teamwork,

1598
01:21:24,131 --> 01:21:27,860
and each of them expressed their energy so well.

1599
01:21:28,061 --> 01:21:30,870
It was a wonderful performance. You were awesome.

1600
01:21:30,931 --> 01:21:32,431
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1601
01:21:34,341 --> 01:21:37,710
We haven't seen the high level group's performance yet,

1602
01:21:38,570 --> 01:21:39,971
but I don't think it'll be better than this.

1603
01:21:39,971 --> 01:21:42,141
Wait, they're not the high level group?

1604
01:21:42,311 --> 01:21:44,051
I thought they were.

1605
01:21:44,450 --> 01:21:45,610
It was amazing.

1606
01:21:45,610 --> 01:21:48,851
Their singing was just flawless.

1607
01:21:49,150 --> 01:21:53,650
They seemed more professional than any other experienced artists,

1608
01:21:53,820 --> 01:21:55,660
and they also had incredible teamwork.

1609
01:21:55,660 --> 01:21:58,061
Their individual performances were great,

1610
01:21:58,061 --> 01:22:00,830
but they also did a terrific job as a team.

1611
01:22:04,671 --> 01:22:07,441
They were perfect as a team, but there were...

1612
01:22:07,441 --> 01:22:10,710
some members that caught my eye in particular.

1613
01:22:10,910 --> 01:22:13,410
Nana, you performed in the center...

1614
01:22:13,410 --> 01:22:15,881
- during the intro. - Yes.

1615
01:22:15,941 --> 01:22:19,481
You were way more charismatic than I expected.

1616
01:22:19,851 --> 01:22:23,250
During the dance where you shake your shoulders,

1617
01:22:23,250 --> 01:22:26,421
you just looked fabulous.

1618
01:22:26,421 --> 01:22:27,660
It was great. I really enjoyed it.

1619
01:22:27,660 --> 01:22:28,990
Thank you.

1620
01:22:32,261 --> 01:22:34,000
Gyoryeon.

1621
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:37,400
Your singing was nice and steady in the middle.

1622
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:38,500
Thank you.

1623
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:39,601
I thought...

1624
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:42,700
you were really good at controlling the vocal dynamics.

1625
01:22:42,801 --> 01:22:44,641
It was so pleasing...

1626
01:22:44,641 --> 01:22:46,070
- and easy on the ear. - Thank you.

1627
01:22:46,141 --> 01:22:48,441
For me, it was Haram.

1628
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:52,511
I thought she wasn't playing a major role...

1629
01:22:52,511 --> 01:22:54,521
- You're right. - in this performance,

1630
01:22:54,521 --> 01:22:58,650
but she totally knocked my socks off during the dance break.

1631
01:22:59,021 --> 01:23:00,620
She was on fire.

1632
01:23:04,691 --> 01:23:08,061
It was so powerful. I was very impressed.

1633
01:23:08,061 --> 01:23:09,431
Thank you.

1634
01:23:11,231 --> 01:23:14,641
Producers, what did you think of their performance?

1635
01:23:15,141 --> 01:23:17,740
It took us a lot of work...

1636
01:23:17,740 --> 01:23:20,740
to finish this song, and the recording took a long time.

1637
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:23,011
It wasn't easy,

1638
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:26,551
but they gave a perfect performance as a team, and I loved it.

1639
01:23:26,780 --> 01:23:28,521
I have to talk about Gabi.

1640
01:23:28,521 --> 01:23:31,891
Gabi had to be reassigned to a completely different part.

1641
01:23:31,891 --> 01:23:35,061
She cried a lot during the recording,

1642
01:23:35,061 --> 01:23:37,261
and I was really worried about her.

1643
01:23:37,261 --> 01:23:40,360
But she did her best to complete her part,

1644
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:41,830
and I want to thank her for that.

1645
01:23:41,830 --> 01:23:44,000
It was a great performance overall.

1646
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,131
Well done.

1647
01:23:45,131 --> 01:23:46,771
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1648
01:23:51,671 --> 01:23:55,210
(It's time to decide the winner and the loser.)

1649
01:23:56,210 --> 01:23:57,610
This is going to be tough.

1650
01:24:09,820 --> 01:24:12,290
We will now announce the Level Station levels.

1651
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:16,460
The winner of the Average Level Battle is...

1652
01:24:18,301 --> 01:24:20,841
(Team Attention)

1653
01:24:21,101 --> 01:24:23,740
(Team Twinkle)

1654
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,941
I can't believe three members will be eliminated.

1655
01:24:26,870 --> 01:24:27,941
I can't watch this.

1656
01:24:28,181 --> 01:24:29,240
I can't watch this.

1657
01:24:29,540 --> 01:24:31,450
The winner of the Average Level Battle is...

1658
01:24:31,450 --> 01:24:33,681
(Who is the winner of the Average Level Battle?)

1659
01:24:34,351 --> 01:24:38,021
(To be continued)

1660
01:24:40,460 --> 01:24:42,500
The winner of the Average Level Battle is...

1661
01:24:47,071 --> 01:24:48,471
Team Attention.

1662
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Thank you.

1663
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:54,210
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1664
01:24:54,210 --> 01:24:55,280
(Team Attention won.)

1665
01:24:55,740 --> 01:24:57,240
(3 members of Team Attention will be promoted.)

1666
01:24:57,240 --> 01:24:58,651
(3 members of Team Twinkle will be eliminated.)

1667
01:24:59,410 --> 01:25:00,481
Thank you.

1668
01:25:08,221 --> 01:25:11,361
But they did well. They did well.

1669
01:25:11,830 --> 01:25:14,590
- I don't like this. - I lost my energy.

1670
01:25:15,231 --> 01:25:16,301
Now,

1671
01:25:17,101 --> 01:25:19,771
the winning team members' fates will be decided.

1672
01:25:21,571 --> 01:25:23,370
How did they pick three members among them?

1673
01:25:25,311 --> 01:25:29,210
We will now announce the three promoted members...

1674
01:25:29,511 --> 01:25:31,380
of the winning team that were chosen by the Unicorns.

1675
01:25:32,551 --> 01:25:36,551
(All members of Team Attention had incredible talent.)

1676
01:25:40,391 --> 01:25:41,651
The promoted members are...

1677
01:25:45,691 --> 01:25:46,761
Nana.

1678
01:25:47,590 --> 01:25:48,700
Thank you.

1679
01:25:48,700 --> 01:25:51,231
(The first promoted member, Nana)

1680
01:25:52,971 --> 01:25:54,500
Goo Gyoryeon.

1681
01:25:54,801 --> 01:25:56,040
Thank you.

1682
01:25:56,441 --> 01:25:57,540
Congratulations.

1683
01:25:58,670 --> 01:25:59,710
Lastly...

1684
01:25:59,710 --> 01:26:00,771
(Who is the last promoted member?)

1685
01:26:02,210 --> 01:26:06,181
I was determined to get promoted.

1686
01:26:06,851 --> 01:26:11,420
I didn't get the Unicorn Ticketing last time,

1687
01:26:11,551 --> 01:26:13,821
so I was more desperate.

1688
01:26:14,891 --> 01:26:18,420
(Who will get promoted last on the average level?)

1689
01:26:18,420 --> 01:26:20,630
Bae Haram. Congratulations.

1690
01:26:20,630 --> 01:26:23,061
(The third promoted member, Bae Haram)

1691
01:26:26,830 --> 01:26:28,740
- Thank you. - They wouldn't be entirely happy.

1692
01:26:29,540 --> 01:26:33,670
I am more worried about the three eliminated members.

1693
01:26:34,740 --> 01:26:36,141
From this team,

1694
01:26:36,811 --> 01:26:38,511
three members will be eliminated.

1695
01:26:38,511 --> 01:26:39,750
That's right.

1696
01:26:41,681 --> 01:26:42,721
Firstly...

1697
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:46,051
This is really hard.

1698
01:26:46,891 --> 01:26:50,261
What would be the right way to explain our decision?

1699
01:26:50,261 --> 01:26:52,391
Hyerin didn't catch my attention...

1700
01:26:52,391 --> 01:26:53,861
- like I said earlier. - Yes.

1701
01:26:54,530 --> 01:26:56,901
- Yes. - I think she lacks talent.

1702
01:26:57,731 --> 01:26:59,000
- I agree. - It isn't something...

1703
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,870
she can improve in a short amount of time.

1704
01:27:01,830 --> 01:27:03,670
One thing is certain.

1705
01:27:03,670 --> 01:27:05,511
She was someone who never caught my eye.

1706
01:27:05,740 --> 01:27:09,311
But she showed potential during this performance.

1707
01:27:10,511 --> 01:27:14,511
(It's hard to make a decision since there are many aspects.)

1708
01:27:14,710 --> 01:27:17,021
Chaewon is the one who did well today.

1709
01:27:17,021 --> 01:27:18,051
I agree.

1710
01:27:18,051 --> 01:27:20,090
- She let things go. - Yes.

1711
01:27:20,321 --> 01:27:24,521
I feel like she can only pull off a limited number of songs.

1712
01:27:24,521 --> 01:27:26,530
I feel like she can only shine...

1713
01:27:26,530 --> 01:27:27,861
when she performs a song like "Superstar."

1714
01:27:28,761 --> 01:27:30,200
Unless she does much better,

1715
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:32,431
- we can't keep Kotoko much longer. - That's right.

1716
01:27:32,431 --> 01:27:33,431
I agree.

1717
01:27:33,530 --> 01:27:35,870
I think there is a reason why...

1718
01:27:35,870 --> 01:27:37,941
the producers gave her more parts.

1719
01:27:37,941 --> 01:27:38,971
That's right.

1720
01:27:38,971 --> 01:27:41,040
- I can see that she is improving. - She continues to improve.

1721
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:42,441
She does improve very quickly.

1722
01:27:42,441 --> 01:27:43,941
- That's right. - That's right.

1723
01:27:43,941 --> 01:27:47,280
It might be better to pick people we want to keep seeing.

1724
01:27:48,410 --> 01:27:50,250
Shall we go with this decision?

1725
01:27:50,250 --> 01:27:51,280
- Yes. - Okay.

1726
01:27:53,221 --> 01:27:54,391
I feel bad.

1727
01:28:13,571 --> 01:28:14,641
We will now announce...

1728
01:28:15,780 --> 01:28:18,851
the eliminated members of the average level.

1729
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:27,651
The three eliminated members of the losing team are...

1730
01:28:27,651 --> 01:28:29,990
(Who are the 3 eliminated members of the losing team?)

1731
01:28:31,261 --> 01:28:32,931
- Please. - Oh, no.

1732
01:28:38,561 --> 01:28:40,771
I was very anxious, to be honest.

1733
01:28:41,170 --> 01:28:45,441
I thought I might be 1 of the 3 eliminated members.

1734
01:28:45,941 --> 01:28:48,471
The three eliminated members of the losing team are...

1735
01:28:48,471 --> 01:28:51,880
(Who are the 3 eliminated members of the losing team?)

1736
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:54,351
(To be continued)

1737
01:28:55,857 --> 01:28:58,456
The three eliminated members of the losing team are...

1738
01:29:00,567 --> 01:29:01,567
Nako.

1739
01:29:02,866 --> 01:29:05,397
(The first eliminated member, Nako)

1740
01:29:05,397 --> 01:29:06,506
Choi Hyerin.

1741
01:29:06,506 --> 01:29:08,637
(The second eliminated member, Choi Hyerin)

1742
01:29:22,687 --> 01:29:25,557
Kwon Chaewon. Thank you for your hard work.

1743
01:29:25,557 --> 01:29:27,786
(The third eliminated member, Kwon Chaewon)

1744
01:29:27,786 --> 01:29:29,227
Thank you.

1745
01:29:29,227 --> 01:29:31,296
(The third eliminated member, Kwon Chaewon)

1746
01:29:31,897 --> 01:29:33,166
Thank you for your hard work.

1747
01:29:34,397 --> 01:29:35,496
Thank you.

1748
01:29:49,677 --> 01:29:51,017
There is something...

1749
01:29:52,217 --> 01:29:54,847
I really want to say to Chaewon.

1750
01:29:55,616 --> 01:29:57,156
On the stage today,

1751
01:29:57,916 --> 01:30:00,656
seeing you...

1752
01:30:00,656 --> 01:30:03,597
and being able to call your name...

1753
01:30:03,897 --> 01:30:05,097
made me very happy.

1754
01:30:05,527 --> 01:30:09,067
I thought, "This is the performance Kwon Chaewon can show."

1755
01:30:09,527 --> 01:30:13,237
I was very happy to see it today.

1756
01:30:14,107 --> 01:30:16,036
- And Hyerin... - Yes.

1757
01:30:16,036 --> 01:30:17,576
- and Nako. - Yes.

1758
01:30:17,836 --> 01:30:20,906
You already have shining potential.

1759
01:30:21,177 --> 01:30:23,517
So you should think, "I am someone who shines."

1760
01:30:23,517 --> 01:30:25,477
"How can I shine brighter?"

1761
01:30:25,477 --> 01:30:27,887
I hope you will find the answer.

1762
01:30:28,286 --> 01:30:31,156
You have been doing very well. You did well today as well.

1763
01:30:31,156 --> 01:30:32,687
- Thank you. - Thank you for your hard work.

1764
01:31:00,147 --> 01:31:01,987
To me, Universe Ticket was...

1765
01:31:02,847 --> 01:31:05,956
a good stepping stone...

1766
01:31:08,786 --> 01:31:13,097
on my way to become an idol singer. Thank you so much.

1767
01:31:20,237 --> 01:31:23,677
I will leave Universe Ticket now,

1768
01:31:24,506 --> 01:31:27,076
but I experienced many things...

1769
01:31:28,246 --> 01:31:31,916
through this show.

1770
01:31:31,916 --> 01:31:39,286
I was happy to show my performances to the fans.

1771
01:31:39,826 --> 01:31:41,357
Thank you.

1772
01:31:48,796 --> 01:31:49,836
(Before leaving Universe Ticket,)

1773
01:31:49,836 --> 01:31:53,366
(what does she want to say to the Unicorns?)

1774
01:31:53,366 --> 01:31:54,506
Hello,

1775
01:31:55,237 --> 01:31:56,406
I am Kwon Chaewon.

1776
01:31:58,607 --> 01:32:00,246
Thank you...

1777
01:32:00,246 --> 01:32:03,347
for giving me a good experience and great advice.

1778
01:32:03,347 --> 01:32:05,616
I am going home after learning and feeling...

1779
01:32:05,616 --> 01:32:06,987
many things.

1780
01:32:06,987 --> 01:32:08,987
I will come back...

1781
01:32:09,857 --> 01:32:12,857
as Chaewon who is cooler and maturer.

1782
01:32:13,326 --> 01:32:14,427
When that happens...

1783
01:32:16,456 --> 01:32:17,557
When that happens,

1784
01:32:18,156 --> 01:32:22,067
please just accept me as a younger sister...

1785
01:32:22,067 --> 01:32:23,126
and a junior singer.

1786
01:32:23,397 --> 01:32:24,737
Thank you.

1787
01:32:29,536 --> 01:32:32,406
(We are both teammates and rivals.)

1788
01:32:32,536 --> 01:32:34,647
(The war of nerves becomes heated up due to their competition for parts.)

1789
01:32:34,746 --> 01:32:36,477
(I can't help but become a bit wary.)

1790
01:32:37,046 --> 01:32:39,546
(When you let you guard down and become distracted,)

1791
01:32:40,147 --> 01:32:41,946
(your rival will move up quickly.)

1792
01:32:42,086 --> 01:32:43,557
(Where did they bring someone like her?)

1793
01:32:44,086 --> 01:32:45,156
(Seowon's part...)

1794
01:32:45,156 --> 01:32:46,586
(should go to Elisia.)

1795
01:32:46,656 --> 01:32:48,286
You need to practice singing a bit harder.

1796
01:32:48,687 --> 01:32:53,326
(They win and lose parts amidst their struggle to survive.)

1797
01:32:53,597 --> 01:32:56,366
It wasn't a coincidence

1798
01:32:56,496 --> 01:32:57,737
(This could be your last chance.)

1799
01:32:57,866 --> 01:32:59,467
(To survive,)

1800
01:32:59,467 --> 01:33:01,467
(they need to be more desperate.)

1801
01:33:01,607 --> 01:33:02,866
(That was amazing.)

1802
01:33:04,237 --> 01:33:07,347
(I don't want to lose my part.)

1803
01:33:09,977 --> 01:33:12,576
(At the crossroads of promotion and elimination,)

1804
01:33:12,876 --> 01:33:15,987
(which girls will survive?)

1805
01:33:16,987 --> 01:33:19,317
(That was insane. That was incredible.)

1806
01:33:19,586 --> 01:33:21,826
(We will announce the eliminated members.)

1807
01:33:23,326 --> 01:33:25,156
It wasn't like Seowon did badly.

1808
01:33:27,166 --> 01:33:28,597
You know that you did well, right?

1809
01:33:29,067 --> 01:33:30,097
You know that, right?

1810
01:33:36,536 --> 01:33:38,437
The dream ticketing for the debut.

1811
01:33:38,836 --> 01:33:41,206
Vote for your favorite girl.

1812
01:33:42,046 --> 01:33:46,446

1813

1814
01:33:50,086 --> 01:33:52,987

01:33:52,987 --> 01:33:55,286
you can cast up to 2 tickets to 1 girl.

1816

Make sure to reserve a ticket for the girls' dreams.
