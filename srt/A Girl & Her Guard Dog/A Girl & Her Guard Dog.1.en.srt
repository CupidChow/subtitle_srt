Toho Co., Ltd.

2
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,920
Congratulations on Passing

3
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,800
To become the person you wanted to be

4
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:38,910
"Ordinary days." What a special phrase.

5
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:46,510
I'm going to have that ordinary life through a normal high school experience.

6
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,400
Ah. Welcome back, Ms. Isaku.

7
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,500
Ah, welcome back.

8
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:13,450
Why are you half-naked?

9
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,120
It's just hot.

10
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,290
It's just March.

11
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,160
Oh, right. Sorry about that.

12
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:29,130
Grandpa, I'm home.

13
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,300
Isaku? Come on in.

14
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:35,700
Welcome back. How'd it go?

15
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,120
I passed.

16
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:42,080
That's great. Your parents would be so proud.

17
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:43,690
Thanks.

18
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:51,050
My parents died in a car accident when I was five.

19
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,850
The one who took me in was my only remaining family, my grandfather.

20
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,250
Tasuke Senagaki, the third boss of the Senagaki clan.

21
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:06,960
In other words, I live in a yakuza household, and I'm the boss's granddaughter.

22
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,770
Excuse me.

23
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,150
Ms. Isaku.

24
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,890
How was the exam result?

25
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:16,140
I passed.

26
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,800
Huh? Nooo!

27
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,240
- Whoa!
- Congratulations!

28
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,340
You're way too happy! Put me down, seriously!

29
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,040
Of course I'm happy. You worked really hard.

30
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:32,300
Can't believe the tiny little
Ms. Isaku's now a high schooler.

31
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,810
It's really something to see.

32
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,030
He's Keiya Uto. The underboss of our family.

33
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:41,540
He's lived with us for the past ten years.

34
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:47,270
But still, Otowa High is over an hour away from here.

35
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,900
I picked a far one on purpose.

36
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:01,870
See, when I become a high schooler, I want to have a normal youth!

37
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,660
Oh?

38
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,880
Until now, people were scared of my family, so I never had any friends...

39
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,920
But that's going to change.

40
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,610
I want to go to school normally, and make friends normally.

41
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,990
And then...

42
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,680
I'll fall in love like a normal girl!

43
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:25,230
Yes. I'll fall in love.

44
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,770
A simple, happy kind of love.

45
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:34,210
Because if I fall for a yakuza, there's no bright future waiting for me.

46
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:54,090
96th Otowa
High School
Entrance
Ceremony
Otowa High School

47
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,090
And with that...

48
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:58,260
The entrance ceremony for Otowa High School is now concluded.

49
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:00,070
New students, please...

50
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:04,350
After this, there's the self-introductions, right?

51
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,960
First impressions matter. I can't mess this up.

52
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,060
Whoa!

53
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,150
A boy?

54
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,200
T-Thank you...

55
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,520
very mu...

56
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,520
Are you okay, Ms. Isaku?

57
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:40,880
Huh?! Keiya?! What are you doing here?!

58
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:45,890
I'll explain later. Come on, we have to get to class before homeroom starts.

59
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,660
Huh?

60
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:55,210
What's going on?

61
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,510
I'm Keiya Uto. I'll be with you all this year, nice to meet you.

62
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,840
Is he really a high school student?

63
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,240
Wh-What is this?!

64
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,310
Hey! What do you think you're doing?!

65
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:09,680
An old yakuza geezer dressed up like a high schooler?!

66
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,730
Geezer? I'm only twenty-six.

67
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,570
That's still old enough to count as one!

68
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:19,740
I was worried about you being all alone so far away, so I decided to attend school too.

69
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,110
You can just stick to picking me up and dropping me off like before.

70
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:25,320
No can do. There are dangers even inside the school.

71
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:27,350
What do you mean?

72
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,970
Men! That's what!

73
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,020
Huh?

74
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,680
Didn't you say you wanted to fall in love?

75
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:35,290
Men are wolves, every last one of them!

76
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:39,130
So to guard your body from their fangs,

77
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,200
I enrolled through the back door, so to speak.

78
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,240
Of course, I got permission from the boss too!

79
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:46,330
He actually allowed that?!

80
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,190
Right now, I'm a high school student in both body and soul.

81
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:55,520
Let's go home. The car's over there.

82
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,630
Stop it! Just stop already!

83
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:03,590
There's no way I'm going to school with you! Absolutely not!

84
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,990
Whoa!

85
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,580
So it was just a dream...

86
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,230
Morning.

87
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:22,050
- Wow, that looks amazing.
- Good morning.

88
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,880
Want a little taste?

89
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,010
Yeah.

90
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:30,640
Wait. Why'd you make this much?
Is someone coming over?

91
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,870
It's your lunch.

92
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,170
Huh?

93
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:41,050
Our school life together officially starts today, doesn't it?

94
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:51,040
At school,

95
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,940
don't come anywhere near me at all!

96
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:58,860
Impossible. I'm your bodyguard, remember?

97
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,360
I just want a normal high school life!

98
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,240
Having a 26-year-old geezer yakuza as a classmate

99
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,200
is the worst possible obstacle!

100
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:13,040
Just ignore the 26-year-old "big brother" yakuza and enjoy your youth.

101
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:19,710
I'll be shutting out all the men, though.

102
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,130
You're clearly planning to get in my way!

103
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,160
They've already formed their little groups.

104
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:33,410
Even though they only met yesterday...

105
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:42,690
How do people even make friends again?

106
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:49,680
Aren't you going to talk to someone?

107
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:57,130
Oh right, we're classmates now, so no need to be so formal.

108
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:01,400
I told you not to come near me at school, remember?

109
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,960
And I can stop calling you Ms. Isaku too.

110
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,670
Hey!

111
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,470
Senagaki.

112
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:08,380
Listen to me!

113
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,180
Senagaki.

114
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,410
Senagaki. Senagaki.

115
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:13,280
You two sure seem close.

116
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,680
Oh, told you she's cute.

117
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:20,460
Whoa! They just talked to me normally! I'm so moved!

118
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,460
Uh, u-um...

119
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,670
Yeah, we're really close.

120
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:27,650
We're childhood friends.

121
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:28,570
Huh?

122
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:31,520
We've been together forever,

123
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,010
so there's pretty much nothing we don't know about each other.

124
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:37,230
So yeah, we're that close.

125
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:43,480
Oh right, I should reintroduce myself.
I'm Keiya Uto, 16 years old.

126
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:47,840
My special skill is torture.

127
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,320
- What do you mean, torture?
- Huh?!

128
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,880
Like electric chairs and stuff?

129
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:54,930
You don't need anything like that. A single ballpoint pen is enough.

130
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:56,270
What?!

131
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,500
Want me to show you...

132
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,520
...how it works?

133
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,790
Stop it!

134
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:11,820
I-It's...

135
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,140
It's over!

136
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,140
- Okay.

137
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:17,140
- Now then, we'll start homeroom.
- They totally think I'm weird now...

138
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:21,020
First, let's decide on the class representatives.

139
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,540
One boy and one girl. Any volunteers?

140
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:30,700
Class rep?

141
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:35,200
It might be a good way to get to know people.

142
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,200
I kind of want to try it, but...

143
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,290
I get it, but is anyone going to volunteer?

144
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,590
My spirit's kind of broken after what just happened...

145
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:48,780
I'm socially awkward anyway...

146
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,880
Come on, don't all look down.

147
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,410
Okay, Ms. Nakanuma.
I'll volunteer, along with Senagaki.

148
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,640
- Huh?!
- Oh, thank you!

149
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,140
Wait, who said I agreed to it?!

150
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:05,270
Alright then, the class reps will be Uto and Senagaki!

151
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,520
- Everyone, give them a big hand!
- Huh?

152
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,920
Whaaat?!

153
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,530
Now, let's give our two reps their first task.

154
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:19,030
I'd like you to decide the players for the upcoming sports tournament.

155
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,500
E-Everyone... uh...

156
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,380
U-Um...

157
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:39,310
Okay, everyone face forward. Let's pick players for each event!

158
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:41,560
Hey, is there even a point to doing this?

159
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,060
It might be a good chance for everyone to get closer, right?

160
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,230
Huh?

161
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:48,880
Well, at least I want to get along with you, Satonaka.

162
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:51,710
Huh? You already remember my name?

163
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:56,130
Yeah, I memorized everyone's.
That's where relationships start, right?

164
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:02,540
Doesn't it makes you happy when you feel like people actually notice you, right?

165
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:06,020
It's a small thing, but I think it matters.

166
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,150
Who the hell are you?

167
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,800
Ah. Morikawa, you're tall so you should play basketball.

168
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,700
You even kinda look like Michael Jordan.

169
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,760
No, I don't!

170
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,960
Senagaki!

171
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,330
Got it! Ow, ow!

172
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,610
Senagaki!

173
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,130
Senagaki!

174
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,050
Ah!

175
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:34,300
Senagaki!

176
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:35,610
Wah!

177
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:44,370
Come on, it's just a sports tournament. Just have fun with it!

178
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,100
Yeah yeah, we'll cover for each other.

179
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,770
Thank you...

180
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,020
Ms. Isaku, dinner's ready.

181
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,730
Don't just come inside my room!

182
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,770
What's wrong? You feeling sick?

183
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,080
It's tough...

184
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:29,490
I can't communicate with people.

185
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,820
And I suck at volleyball.

186
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,890
Oh, that's all?

187
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:41,610
That's nothing new though.

188
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,470
Hey, you ever heard of "tact"?

189
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:50,040
Ugh! And why are you having such a fun school life anyway?!

190
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,150
You even volunteered to be a class rep on your own!

191
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,700
Ms. Isaku.

192
00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:00,960
I understand you're anxious, but that "happy youth" you were talking about,

193
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,580
was just a vague fantasy in the end.

194
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,900
Don't call it "just" anything!

195
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:19,330
I couldn't do anything.

196
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:24,430
That smooth-talking old yakuza geezer

197
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:27,920
already fits right in with the class.

198
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:34,430
Personally, I don't think the current you is bad at all.

199
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:39,650
When you start listing the things you can't do like that,

200
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:42,480
and stop to look back for a moment,

201
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,530
it just shows you're facing yourself seriously.

202
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:53,520
You cry, you struggle, and sometimes you find a little courage.

203
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,400
I just want your days to become a bit more fun.

204
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:18,300
As for me...

205
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:24,790
I'll always be on your side.

206
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:41,850
I really am such a child.

207
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:49,570
I complain about what I'm given, but have I ever actually tried to change anything?

208
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:57,610
Okay, let's go one more round.

209
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:58,790
Got it!

210
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,420
- Ow!
- Are you okay?

211
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:05,550
- Ah, sorry...
- You jerk!

212
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:07,960
You bastard! What the hell do you think you're doing?!

213
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:12,040
The ball hit Ms. Isaku, didn't it?!
What the hell?!

214
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,460
Hey Keiya, seriously, stop!
I asked him to do it!

215
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:20,400
You did?

216
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,200
I'm just practicing for the tournament!

217
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:28,090
You're the one who told me to be brave!

218
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:32,870
That's why I want to take it seriously!

219
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,100
I'll toss the ball this time.

220
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,690
No. You'll go easy on me.

221
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:42,670
Ruka, please.

222
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:47,470
Huh? Ah. Okay, understood.

223
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:51,010
Huh? Senagaki, what happened to those bruises?

224
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:52,740
- Huh?
- Whoa.

225
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:57,600
Whoa, yeah. That looks like it really hurts.

226
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:00,360
Oh, this?

227
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:04,780
I got it while practicing volleyball on my own.

228
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,950
Wow, so you've been really giving it your all!

229
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,300
So you were really motivated, huh?

230
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:18,640
Well, I didn't get much better though...

231
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:23,380
I just thought that if I don't drag everyone down, maybe we can win.

232
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:24,880
Win?

233
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:27,340
Yeah.

234
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:33,530
Should we go for the win then?

235
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:34,910
We still have time, after all!

236
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,660
Let's meet up during lunch whenever we can!

237
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,600
- Yeah!
- Let's do our best, Isaku!

238
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,860
You got this!

239
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:51,160
Let's return it!

240
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:54,310
Let's return it! Let's go!

241
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:56,480
Get ready, the ball's coming!

242
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,200
- Isaku!
- Got it!

243
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,640
Nice one!

244
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:03,250
We did it!

245
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,400
One more point and we win!

246
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,760
Stay focused!

247
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,610
Let's do this!

248
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,720
Let's go!

249
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,910
Isaku, here goes!

250
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,710
Yeah—haa!

251
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,910
My finger somehow really hurts...

252
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,910
What?! It hurts so bad!

253
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,990
- Isaku!
- Huh?

254
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:40,370
If I can't use my hand...

255
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,410
We did it! We're champions!

256
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,140
- We won?
- We won!

257
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,960
Amazing!

258
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,290
- Isaku, that was awesome!
- That foot move was sick!

259
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:06,370
I was so into it, I didn't even realize what was happening!

260
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:06,820
Huh?

261
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,970
That was Uto, right?

262
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,330
Yeah.

263
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:31,190
Let's have a doctor check your hand later, okay?

264
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:32,610
Yeah.

265
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,760
Thanks.

266
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,870
You've really been glowing lately.

267
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:47,750
I'm happy, but at the same time

268
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:52,740
it feels kinda lonely, thinking you might not need me anymore.

269
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,720
What do you...

270
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:01,620
mean by that?

271
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,840
I guess this is what they call "growing apart as a parent," huh.

272
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,970
Growing apart as a parent, huh?

273
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,970
It's the opposite.

274
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:34,290
I can keep going because you're on my side, Keiya.

275
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,750
Huh? What?

276
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,750
I'm glad.

277
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,630
I need to fall in love.

278
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:05,250
Something normal and happy.

279
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:14,420
Because falling for a yakuza

280
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,060
there's no bright future in that.

281
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,520
That concludes the school assembly.
Thank you, everyone.

282
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,440
Thank you.

283
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:33,270
I'm going to the restroom. Please wait here.

284
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:35,070
You're not sneaking off for a smoke, are you?

285
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:37,530
I'm seriously just going to the restroom.

286
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,410
Senagaki.

287
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,690
Is that right?

288
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,270
Ah. Y-Yes.

289
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,360
I'm Masato Todoroki, from the class next door.

290
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:03,420
Oh, I'm Isaku Senagaki from Class 3.

291
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,720
I know.

292
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:08,790
Wanna exchange contacts? Let's be friends.

293
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,150
F-Friends?

294
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,520
Yeah.

295
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,590
Wow...

296
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,300
Is that a no?

297
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:27,310
Thanks.

298
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,560
Your profile icon's really cute.

299
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,440
Whoa!

300
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:39,600
What the hell are you doing?!

301
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:42,380
Sorry, didn't realize someone was here.

302
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,840
- Since you're so tiny.
- Keiya!

303
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:48,050
You're Todoroki from the next class, right?

304
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:52,170
For now, could you back off from Isaku?

305
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:52,920
Hey!

306
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,440
In exchange, I'll hook you up...

307
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:00,380
- with another girl...
- Stop!

308
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,490
He definitely thinks we're weird.

309
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:08,660
He's probably like "what the hell's with these two?"

310
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:17,110
New Message

311
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:19,610
I'm Isaku Senagaki. Nice to meet you.

312
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:22,240
He's so kind.

313
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:27,870
If only I could fall for someone normal like that...

314
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:30,040
I'm going to karaoke with some
hometown friends soon.
Do you want to join?

315
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:37,570
Ohh! Karaoke with his hometown friends! So youthful...

316
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:40,720
Ms. Isaku!

317
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,630
Whoa!

318
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:47,270
Hey! Give that back! What are you doing?!

319
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:49,410
I'm blocking that guy's contact.

320
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:52,790
Stop messing around! Give it back already! Quit it!

321
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:12,410
You're too young to be in a relationship.

322
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,670
Then when and with what kind of guy would it be okay?

323
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,390
That would be...

324
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,270
After you graduate high school, go to college, and get a job.

325
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:40,540
Someone who treats you with real care.

326
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:43,420
Who's kind, mature, and shares your values and sense of money.

327
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,820
That's too long! Are you stupid?!

328
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:59,460
I'll choose who I like myself!

329
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:02,800
Get out!

330
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:16,890
I'm not as much of a child as you think, Keiya.

331
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:29,970
♪ NANANA...

332
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:34,180
♪ Woo, your slightly sun-kissed skin.

333
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:36,560
♪ I can't take my eyes off you again.

334
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,100
♪ Who's reflected in those eyes of yours?

335
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,730
♪ Tell me now, honey.

336
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:54,200
Since then, I haven't seen or talked to Keiya at all.

337
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:58,160
And I snuck out quietly.

338
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:04,590
No, no. I should stop thinking about him.

339
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,430
Huh?

340
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,720
Huh?!

341
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:17,100
Whaaat?!

342
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:23,020
What kind of party is this?! You said they were your hometown friends!

343
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,700
No one is listening.

344
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,790
Having fun, Senagaki?

345
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:49,760
Um, maybe I should head home...

346
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,200
I've always liked you, Senagaki.

347
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,140
Huh?! He's that kind of guy?!

348
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,370
You're cute and quiet.

349
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:02,480
What?

350
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,500
Everyone's having fun, so...

351
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,500
We should too.

352
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:08,340
Whaaaat?!

353
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:20,620
Hm?

354
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:28,840
S-Stop...

355
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:32,080
I said stop!

356
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,690
Ah.

357
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:57,720
If you don't want to end up like him, keep what happened here a secret.

358
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:05,620
Did he do something to you?

359
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,320
No, he didn't.

360
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,630
Just barely.

361
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:20,260
Thank goodness.

362
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:30,610
I really am still a child.

363
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:38,300
How did you even find me here?

364
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:40,140
GPS.

365
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:41,560
What?!

366
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:45,890
I set your phone so I can track it.

367
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,070
Whaaat?!

368
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:54,120
Oh, sorry. I got lipstick on you.

369
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,100
What the hell.

370
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:18,730
You asked me before, remember?

371
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:23,560
About when and what kind of guy it's okay to fall in love with.

372
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,040
Yeah.

373
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:37,700
Whoever tries to take you from me,
that guy's not acceptable.

374
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,250
Even though I'm like keeping a beast,

375
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:56,300
he looks at me with such childlike eyes.

376
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,960
Yeah, yeah.

377
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:04,550
I'm tired. I'll nap for a bit.

378
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:07,100
Okay.

379
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,770
Let's go.

380
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:52,540
Hey! What the hell is this?!

381
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,270
It's the test that was returned today.

382
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,770
That's not what I'm talking about!

383
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:59,590
What's with this score?!
Zero points?! Are you serious?!

384
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,510
Stuff like this doesn't matter anyway.

385
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:02,950
I'll just get in through connections any...

386
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:05,080
Quiet down! You're too loud!

387
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:10,020
I'll pass the grade anyway through connections.

388
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:14,690
You're a student! Study! Schoolwork is your main job!

389
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:17,230
You don't even use this stuff in real life.

390
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:21,190
Then quit school and you can't be a bodyguard either.

391
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:23,430
Fine, I'll do it.

392
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,710
Ask me if there's something you don't understand.

393
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:32,110
I don't understand.

394
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:36,190
You haven't even answered the first question yet!

395
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,410
I don't get the very first one.

396
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,510
What?

397
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,560
Don't "what?" me.

398
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,490
Oh, Isaku.

399
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,970
Studying?

400
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:51,060
Yeah, studying for the test.

401
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,980
Huh? You're taking the makeup test too?

402
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:56,250
Uh, Ke... Uto is.

403
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:58,770
Right? You look like you'd be smart, Isaku.

404
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:00,320
You're tutoring Uto?

405
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,470
Yeah.

406
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,360
Then can we join you?

407
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,070
We've got makeup tests too, actually.

408
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:08,270
It'd really help if you could teach us too.

409
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:11,910
Sure, if you don't mind me.

410
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:13,770
- Yay!
- Nice!

411
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:15,750
I totally underestimated high school exams.

412
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:16,920
Yikes! Are we being too loud?

413
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:21,950
Studying with classmates. This is kind of youthful too.

414
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:24,070
By the way, I've been wondering...

415
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:25,200
Are you two dating?

416
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,590
Huh?

417
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,640
Uh...

418
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:31,200
- That's...
- No, we are not.

419
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,810
Huh?!

420
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:41,420
I knew that already, deep down...

421
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:51,420
But it's the first time he's said "no" so clearly.

422
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:02,790
It's been about an hour, and he hasn't moved an inch.

423
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,760
That's scary.

424
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,270
Thank you so much.

425
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,950
Excuse me.

426
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:24,230
Ms. Kaori, Mr. Uto is here to see you.

427
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:29,200
Sorry, excuse me for a bit.

428
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,190
Uto.

429
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,780
You're leaving already?

430
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:41,460
I just came by to check on things today.

431
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,670
You're so cold, even though it's been a while since we met.

432
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:49,300
I left a few of the younger ones behind.

433
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:59,330
Hey Uto, after work...

434
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:02,000
I've got school early tomorrow too.

435
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,260
School?

436
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,860
What are you doing there?

437
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,460
Ms. Isaku!

438
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,600
Huh?

439
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,350
Ah! Uh...

440
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:41,190
Uh, I'm gonna go take a bath!

441
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:42,730
Whoa! Whoa!

442
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:44,000
Are you okay?

443
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,820
Ms. Isaku?

444
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:01,370
Are you mad because I haven't been studying seriously?

445
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:03,880
How do you even get that idea?!

446
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,320
Yeah, that's right.

447
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:20,640
Ms. Isaku.

448
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,420
What?

449
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:27,420
To boost motivation,
I think I need a reward.

450
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,550
You sound like a kid.

451
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:31,050
Will you give me one?

452
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:38,890
Fine, fine. If you pass the retest.

453
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,740
I'll do my best!

454
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:46,120
He's not gonna pass it anyway.

455
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:48,900
But then, during the break...

456
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,280
Teacher! I have a question!

457
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:52,780
Don't call me "teacher."

458
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:53,930
Even at home...

459
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:55,070
Ms. Isaku.

460
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:56,390
There's something I don't understand.

461
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:58,580
No! Later!

462
00:34:58,580 --> 00:34:59,680
Okay.

463
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:03,540
He suddenly got serious.

464
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:08,250
What's up with him?!

465
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,600
I passed!

466
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,440
Seriously?!

467
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:21,140
So you could do it if you tried.

468
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:24,000
Wait, are these real?

469
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,560
They're real.

470
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:28,020
Congrats.

471
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:32,260
About that reward...

472
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:36,760
Ah, right, you mentioned that. What do you want?

473
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,200
I want to kiss you.

474
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,920
Why?

475
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:51,700
Because I want to.

476
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:54,020
That doesn't explain anything!

477
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,280
I don't get it.

478
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:05,560
To think you said we weren't dating the other day.

479
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,710
- That's because...
- No.

480
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:15,760
Absolutely not.

481
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:23,370
Got it.

482
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,830
Then I'll think of another request.

483
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,580
I'll go make some food.

484
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:36,950
Huh?

485
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:40,180
Whaaat?!

486
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:46,540
What's with him?! Why's he acting like that all of a sudden?!

487
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,160
- Ms. Isaku!
- Yeah?!

488
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:53,690
For my reward, there's somewhere I want to go with you.

489
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:02,720
Why the zoo?

490
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,680
You like animals, right?

491
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,320
I do but...

492
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,880
You were happy when I brought you here before.

493
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,910
Wait, could it be...

494
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,730
Is there something you want to see?

495
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:20,340
He's trying to make me happy?

496
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:28,390
Red pandas.

497
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:34,790
Huh?

498
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:37,050
The red pandas are that way.

499
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:39,610
Ah! Wow!

500
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:47,910
Ah!

501
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:49,830
Red Panda House

502
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:54,610
Whoa!

503
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,040
Can you see them?

504
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,390
N-No no no no! Put me down!

505
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:04,950
- You're done already?
- Yeah.

506
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:10,620
Geez.

507
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:13,060

D-Do you still want to do it?

540
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:54,180
If you don't want to, I won't do it.

541
00:40:56,410 --> 00:41:00,170
If I go any further...

542
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:03,840
I'm sure I'll...

543
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,550
It's not that I don't want to.

544
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:17,870
The truth is, it's not that I don't want to.

545
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,880
When you say it's not that you don't want to...

546
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,390
Does that mean it's okay?

547
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:41,670
Wait.

548
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:48,420
Noooo!

549
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,820
I said it! I actually said it's not that I don't want to!

550
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,450
Ms. Isaku...

551
00:42:57,910 --> 00:43:02,060
It's me. Bring the car around.

552
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:19,730
Keiya...

553
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,370
I'm fine. It just grazed me.

554
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,390
Keiya...

555
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:40,620
Ms. Isaku...

556
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:46,830
Are you okay?!

557
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:54,490
Kidding, I'm just joking.

558
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,530
I was seriously worried!

559
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:07,210
I thought it'd lighten the mood. Sorry.

560
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,840
Ms. Isaku?

561
00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:23,330
What I said earlier...

562
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,690
I want you to forget it.

563
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:33,250
Understood.

564
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:46,250
We were always together, yet...

565
00:44:47,770 --> 00:44:52,990
I thought I understood him, but I really didn't.

566
00:44:55,030 --> 00:45:00,680
Keiya could just disappear like that again, without warning.

567
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:05,620
That's why I have to fall in love

568
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:10,290
with someone ordinary, in a simple, happy love.

569
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:12,040
Ms. Isaku.

570
00:45:15,070 --> 00:45:17,250
The boss wants to see you.

571
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,010
The Koudan group claims he was expelled ages ago.

572
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:22,140
But they're pretending not to know anything.

573
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:26,890
But it seems they want to avoid an all-out war.

574
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:29,160
I'm sorry.

575
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,130
I've caused trouble for even you, boss.

576
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,130
Be careful.

577
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:40,240
If you go down, the Senagaki group will go...

578
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:42,390
...like that.

579
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:45,920
You've got some nerve saying that.

580
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:49,840
I'm still very much in the game.

581
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:56,960
It's me, Isaku.

582
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,010
Oh, come in.

583
00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:00,590
Excuse me.

584
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,410
Hello, Isaku.

585
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:13,480
H-Hi... it's been a while.

586
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:18,360
Sit down, we've got a cake for you too.

587
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:20,510
Okay.

588
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:24,530
You've gotten even prettier since the last time I saw you.

589
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:26,510
Oh, not at all.

590
00:46:26,510 --> 00:46:30,430
This is my grandson. He's the same grade as you, first year of high school.

591
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:34,370
Ah... N-Nice to meet you...

592
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,030
Hey, do you have a boyfriend?

593
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,560
- Ow!
- What the hell are you asking?!

594
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:50,850
But she's so cute!

595
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:53,520
- Properly introduce yourself!
- Yeah, yeah.

596
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:59,370
I'm Mikio Tanuki, nice to meet you, Isaku.

597
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:05,240
He's kind of the type I'm not good with.

598
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:09,450
I-sa-ku!

599
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:14,830
Whoa, you smell amazing.

600
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:16,560
Nooo!

601
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:24,570
So, what's the deal?

602
00:47:24,930 --> 00:47:26,110
Got a boyfriend?

603
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:30,890
Oh? So it was you, Mr. Mikio.

604
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:34,720
I thought some stray raccoon had wandered in.

605
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:37,630
Who are you again?

606
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:39,360
Keiya!

607
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:43,760
Are you alright? I heard a scream.

608
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:49,850
Oh right, right! Keiya!

609
00:47:49,850 --> 00:47:50,930
Kei, right?

610
00:47:53,090 --> 00:47:57,440
Who do you think you're talking to?
I can tell grandpa, you know.

611
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:02,030
What business do you have here?

612
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:06,860
Just came to get closer to Isaku, right?

613
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:08,450
Please leave.

614
00:48:08,450 --> 00:48:10,600
I told you, I wasn't talking to you!

615
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,200
Right, Isaku?

616
00:48:12,470 --> 00:48:14,580
You're gross, I don't like you.

617
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:18,140
You're a clean freak, huh, Isaku?

618
00:48:32,370 --> 00:48:35,560
Mikio, you're not causing any trouble, are you?

619
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,950
Because if you do, I'm the one who gets yelled at by the boss.

620
00:48:41,090 --> 00:48:43,050
Not really.

621
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,640
The guard dog was there, anyway.

622
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,050
What's that supposed to mean?

623
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:14,120
Hey, Isaku, are you free this Sunday?

624
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:14,850
Huh?

625
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:18,140
- Ta-da! Want to go to this café?
- Let's have a girls' get-together!

626
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:21,210
A girls' get-together?!

627
00:49:22,590 --> 00:49:25,840
I-Is that really okay?

628
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:27,670
So that's a yes?

629
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:29,900
Yes!

630
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:31,510
Yay!

631
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:32,430
So, what time should we go?

632
00:49:32,430 --> 00:49:33,760
Wow, this place is super cute!

633
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,680
Yeah, it's adorable. Like a flower field!

634
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,520
- Isaku...
- That looks delicious.

635
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:38,540
Shall we head home?

636
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:44,730
Sorry, Uto, can you wait a sec?

637
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:48,380
We're talking about our girls' outing right now.

638
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:49,800
I'll come too.

639
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:53,310
Then it wouldn't be a girls' outing!

640
00:49:55,830 --> 00:49:57,580
So cute!

641
00:49:57,580 --> 00:49:59,960
- Cute, right?
- Yeah, super cute!

642
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:03,330
I thought this café really suits you.

643
00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:05,590
What? Thank you so much.

644
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:06,800
- So good!
- Yeah.

645
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,130
- Is it good?
- Hey, let's take a picture later!

646
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:10,090
- Sure.
- Yeah!

647
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:11,900
Let's do it!

648
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:14,470
Hey, Isaku, try this one.

649
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:15,720
Here. It looks tasty.

650
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:18,020
- Looks good, right?
- Yeah, totally!

651
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:20,010
Blueberry?

652
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:24,520
Mmm.

653
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:31,380
By the way...

654
00:50:34,010 --> 00:50:35,680
Sorry about the other day.

655
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:37,640
Hm?

656
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,500
After school, when I asked, "Are you two dating?"

657
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:42,890
I made things awkward...

658
00:50:45,330 --> 00:50:47,900
Oh, no, don't worry about it!

659
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:52,610
But you like Uto, right?

660
00:50:57,510 --> 00:51:03,020
W-well, that's... uh...

661
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:13,150
Honestly, I kinda thought so for a while!

662
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:14,610
Just confess already! Huh?

663
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:17,070
Wait, she should take it slow. They're childhood friends!

664
00:51:17,070 --> 00:51:18,580
Yeah, but it's frustrating, you know?

665
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:19,950
- It's not frustrating!
- What?!

666
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:22,080
- They have history together!
- That doesn't matter anymore!

667
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,060
- It does matter!
- It doesn't!

668
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:24,460
- It totally does!
- No, it doesn't!

669
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:26,790
- She should be careful.
- Nope, she shouldn't!

670
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:28,880
See you, Isaku!

671
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,250
Bye! See you at school!

672
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:41,720
It was the first time I ever opened up to someone.

673
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:45,920
It was embarrassing, but...

674
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:51,830
I'm glad those two listened to me.

675
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:01,640
Keiya
I'll come and pick you up.

676
00:53:03,310 --> 00:53:04,930
Ms. Isaku.

677
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:11,130
You didn't have to come pick me up.

678
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:13,880
I just got off work, so it's fine.

679
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:24,600
Let's go.

680
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:47,380
Hey, you can still go on, can't you?

681
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:49,270
- No... I can't anymore...
- Huh? What'd you say?

682
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:51,650
- I'm sorry...
- What?

683
00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:52,600
- I said I'm sorry!
- Huh?

684
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,980
Can't hear you, can't hear you, can't hear you.

685
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,110
Come on!

686
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:00,300
Hey!

687
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:02,430
Mr. Mikio!

688
00:54:02,430 --> 00:54:04,280
What are you doing?!

689
00:54:06,830 --> 00:54:09,040
The boss is gonna yell at us again!

690
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:11,080
This one wasn't from me today.

691
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:15,520
Ah. No photos, we're filming a movie here.

692
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:16,880
Come on, let's go!

693
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,210
What?

694
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:20,670
Seriously...

695
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:23,510
Don't touch me, damn it.

696
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:25,160
We're going!

697
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:28,120
You're no fun.

698
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:31,230
Mr. Mikio, would you cut it out already?!

699
00:54:31,230 --> 00:54:34,030
I'm the one who gets scolded by the boss, not you!

700
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:38,690
The moment you lock eyes, it's fight, fight, fight. Huh?

701
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:07,150
Heading home from school? Me too, what a coincidence!

702
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:10,760
Yeah, what a coincidence.

703
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:12,370
The puppy's here.

704
00:55:12,370 --> 00:55:14,850
One hottie just did a wall lock to another hottie!

705
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:18,860
What are you doing?

706
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:22,280
Some old yakuza geezer cosplaying as a high schooler?

707
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:30,010
Ms. Isaku, did you find the book?

708
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:33,680
Huh? Uh, well... not yet...

709
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:39,360
I'll wait outside, so take your time.

710
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,980
Seriously, what are you even doing?

711
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:43,740
Can't you tell by looking?

712
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:48,430
Right now, I'm a high schooler, body and soul.

713
00:55:48,430 --> 00:55:50,330
What the hell are you talking about, old geezer?

714
00:55:50,330 --> 00:55:55,620
I'm going to school to protect Ms. Isaku from bad bugs.

715
00:55:55,620 --> 00:56:00,650
I see. "Bad bugs," huh?

716
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:07,570
No way, that's your reason? You're way too overprotective.

717
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:14,960
Please give me your daughter's hand, Father.

718
00:56:27,310 --> 00:56:30,180
Watch your damn mouth,

719
00:56:31,010 --> 00:56:32,890
little brat.

720
00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:38,810
Keiya?

721
00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:44,690
Well then, Mr. Mikio, we'll be taking our leave.

722
00:56:47,110 --> 00:56:48,820
Come on, let's go.

723
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:49,870
Okay.

724
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,710
Mr. Mikio!

725
00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:02,790
Geez, you were here the whole time?

726
00:57:02,790 --> 00:57:04,590
That was scary.

727
00:57:04,590 --> 00:57:05,710
What?

728
00:57:08,510 --> 00:57:10,030
Hey.

729
00:57:12,210 --> 00:57:14,430
I need a favor.

730
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:20,100
Tanuki, no, not the trickster kind.

731
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:25,340
Mikio Tanuki

732
00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:25,280
It's written as "Tanuki" with the characters for ‘field' and ‘pierce.' Nice to meet you!

733
00:57:30,570 --> 00:57:34,450
Oh, it's Isaku! Heeey, I-sa-kuuu!

734
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:37,730
Huh? You two know each other?

735
00:57:37,730 --> 00:57:39,040
Yeah, yeah, um... well...

736
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:43,020
Ah! Uh, well, um...

737
00:57:43,290 --> 00:57:45,900
Tanuki is uh, a relative.

738
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:49,420
Actually, not really.

739
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:50,830
Not really?

740
00:57:51,590 --> 00:57:53,930
Uh, um...

741
00:57:53,930 --> 00:57:59,720
Our parents are close, you could say...

742
00:58:00,350 --> 00:58:01,560
Right.

743
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:15,620
Please! Don't tell anyone about my family!

744
00:58:16,790 --> 00:58:19,300
Oh, so you're the secretive type.

745
00:58:19,910 --> 00:58:23,900
If possible, I'd like you to keep your own background quiet too.

746
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,480
I see.

747
00:58:27,730 --> 00:58:29,860
So, what's the "story" of you two then?

748
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:37,200
Ch-Childhood friends.

749
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,900
That's hilarious.

750
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:44,970
I finally fit in with my class and made friends.

751
00:58:44,970 --> 00:58:46,690
I don't want them to think I'm weird.

752
00:58:48,070 --> 00:58:50,400
I don't want to go back to being alone again.

753
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:54,670
Huh, never thought of it that way. That's new.

754
00:58:56,410 --> 00:59:01,120
Well, people like us aren't gonna die pretty anyway.

755
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,570
We might as well make some fun memories, right?

756
00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:07,650
Fine, I'll keep your secret.

757
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:12,390
But in return!

758
00:59:13,630 --> 00:59:16,580
You both better be nice to me.

759
00:59:17,390 --> 00:59:18,560
What's your real motive?

760
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:22,660
Like I said, I just wanna be friends. That's all.

761
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:26,600
Anyway, later.

762
00:59:34,010 --> 00:59:38,450
Now, we'll decide on what to do for the school festival. If you have ideas, speak up.

763
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:42,470
Even the class rep's getting involved~

764
00:59:42,910 --> 00:59:45,250
Tanuki, you're being too loud.

765
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:46,270
Me, me!

766
00:59:46,270 --> 00:59:47,670
Yes, Ando.

767
00:59:47,670 --> 00:59:50,960
I want us to do a play!
The play will be Romeo and Juliet!

768
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:53,280
I already have the script ready!

769
00:59:58,010 --> 01:00:03,520
Practice and prep might be tough, but the sense of accomplishment will be huge!

770
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:05,520
By expressing yourself differently than usual,

771
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:08,020
you might even discover a new side of yourself.

772
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:11,900
It'll strengthen your friendships, and bring us together as a class!

773
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:15,320
Let's make this one unforgettable page of our youth together!

774
01:00:15,450 --> 01:00:17,450
Oooh!

775
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:20,900
Any other ideas?

776
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:24,120
If not, then it's decided.

777
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:30,110
Now then! About the casting...

778
01:00:30,370 --> 01:00:31,630
Romeo will be Uto.

779
01:00:31,630 --> 01:00:33,610
And Juliet will be Isaku!

780
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:36,340
Ooooh!

781
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:40,620
Whaaat?!

782
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:42,950
Wow, that came from the gut!

783
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:49,250
Huh? Me? Uh, I don't really have any acting experience...

784
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:51,940
That's fine! That's what practice is for!

785
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:53,670
You'll do it, right, Uto?

786
01:00:53,670 --> 01:00:57,280
Yeah, if you're okay with me, I'd be happy to.

787
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:00,510
So what exactly is Romeo and Juliet?

788
01:01:02,370 --> 01:01:03,950
You're starting from there?!

789
01:01:08,830 --> 01:01:10,690
Hey, hey! I object!

790
01:01:11,330 --> 01:01:13,190
I wanna be Romeo too!

791
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:14,800
Absolutely not.

792
01:01:15,010 --> 01:01:19,510
The role of Romeo. No, I am Romeo!

793
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:22,200
I won't let you have Juliet!

794
01:01:22,350 --> 01:01:24,180
He suddenly became Romeo now.

795
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:25,580
Even though he doesn't even know the story.

796
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:28,660
Hmm, but...

797
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:33,350
Every classmate has the right to participate equally, right?

798
01:01:33,550 --> 01:01:36,800
It's everyone's school festival, isn't it, class rep?

799
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:42,470
Let's settle it with rock-paper-scissors.

800
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:44,720
Gladly.

801
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:46,240
Bring it on!

802
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:53,020
Rock, paper, scissors... Go!

803
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:55,410
Ah.

804
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:58,320
Sorry, Isaku.

805
01:02:03,510 --> 01:02:05,970
Honestly, I thought that if you and Uto played lovebirds

806
01:02:05,970 --> 01:02:09,140
maybe your relationship would progress a little, you know?

807
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:10,690
- Right?
- Yeah.

808
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:15,140
That's why I suggested Romeo and Juliet in the first place.

809
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:20,160
Wow, I never thought Tanuki would volunteer for that.

810
01:02:24,410 --> 01:02:28,940
So that's why. They did it for me.

811
01:02:30,410 --> 01:02:33,310
Th-Thank you very much.

812
01:02:34,170 --> 01:02:34,940
Huh?

813
01:02:36,350 --> 01:02:41,630
Well, yeah, it did end up being kind of strange casting.

814
01:02:41,630 --> 01:02:44,670
I'm not really good at being in front of people, but...

815
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:51,610
It's a good chance to try something new, so I'll do my best.

816
01:02:53,330 --> 01:02:54,900
Ooooh.

817
01:02:54,900 --> 01:03:01,880
Romeo, Romeo, why are you Romeo?

818
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:07,680
How was that?

819
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:10,620
- Uh, yeah.
- Mmm, yeah...

820
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,960
- Hard to say.
- Right?

821
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:17,480
Maybe if you put in more emotion, it'll sound better?

822
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:20,730
Okay!

823
01:03:21,630 --> 01:03:24,720
Alright then, next. Tanuki, your turn.

824
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:32,190
After the dance ends, I'll go to her.

825
01:03:32,190 --> 01:03:34,250
I want to touch her hand.

826
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:37,040
I want her to purify this hand of mine.

827
01:03:40,290 --> 01:03:47,500
If these unworthy hands have defiled you,

828
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:55,290
please forgive me.

829
01:03:56,420 --> 01:03:57,580
I won't let you.

830
01:03:57,580 --> 01:03:59,460
What the hell, you overprotective old geezer!

831
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:03,670
Don't you dare touch Ms. Isaku,
I mean, Juliet with your filthy hands!

832
01:04:04,670 --> 01:04:06,310
She's mine!

833
01:04:06,310 --> 01:04:08,410
Hey, Tybalt, it's not your turn yet!

834
01:04:08,410 --> 01:04:10,720
That line's not even in the script!

835
01:04:13,390 --> 01:04:17,440
About the fake sword we use for the duel scene with Romeo,

836
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:19,850
I think a real one would look way more impressive.

837
01:04:19,850 --> 01:04:21,800
How the heck are you planning to prepare that?

838
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:24,440
I can use my personal sword.

839
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:26,340
Aaaah!

840
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:33,890
Tch.

841
01:04:49,890 --> 01:04:54,200
Ms. Isaku, are you mad about something?

842
01:04:55,930 --> 01:04:58,140
Take the rehearsal seriously.

843
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:07,570
Understood.

844
01:05:13,950 --> 01:05:15,940
But I'm telling you,

845
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:19,520
if there are any love scenes between you and Mikio,

846
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:21,610
I'll never allow it.

847
01:05:24,130 --> 01:05:25,960
That's...

848
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:29,320
It's not like I didn't want to play lovers with you either...

849
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:37,810
Wh-What?

850
01:05:42,150 --> 01:05:44,770
If you allow me to touch your hand

851
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:51,290
then please allow me to touch your lips too.

852
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:54,450
Huh?

853
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:38,470
I'm better at it than Mr. Mikio, aren't I?

854
01:06:44,580 --> 01:06:49,820
Why do you even have Romeo's lines memorized?

855
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:56,420
Because I wanted to play Romeo, so I learned them.

856
01:07:11,690 --> 01:07:17,310
The day you picked me up from the girls' hangout,

857
01:07:19,330 --> 01:07:22,000
who was that woman who was with you?

858
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:27,730
Ah. Kaori.

859
01:07:31,420 --> 01:07:33,180
Is she...

860
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:39,840
your girlfriend?

861
01:07:41,350 --> 01:07:43,060
Hmm...

862
01:07:44,730 --> 01:07:48,540
She's not my girlfriend.

863
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:55,530
What's that supposed to mean?

864
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:58,930
Are you jealous?

865
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:03,270
No, I'm not!

866
01:08:15,130 --> 01:08:21,400
The only one who can make me "sit and stay" is you, Ms. Isaku.

867
01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:24,620
Huh?

868
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:27,980
I don't know how much longer, though...

869
01:08:32,940 --> 01:08:35,630
I'm a pretty badly trained dog.

870
01:08:38,490 --> 01:08:42,760
What's that supposed to...

871
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:55,970
Oh my, am I interrupting something?

872
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:59,840
Huh? Not really. We were just about to head home.

873
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:01,700
See? You two are together, huh?

874
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:04,830
N-No, we're not! What are you talking about?!

875
01:09:04,830 --> 01:09:09,670
Oh come on, weren't you two all cuddly and kissy just now?

876
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:12,750
We weren't!

877
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:16,740
We were just rehearsing for the play!

878
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:25,080
Really?!

879
01:09:32,290 --> 01:09:34,170
She's telling the truth.

880
01:09:37,210 --> 01:09:38,680
I see.

881
01:09:40,470 --> 01:09:43,340
Don't get too comfortable, though.

882
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,040
Because some bad bug might try something, you know?

883
01:09:59,860 --> 01:10:02,870
We'll now begin the lunchtime broadcast.

884
01:10:07,540 --> 01:10:10,080
Isaku, you don't have to push yourself so hard anymore.

885
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:11,250
Huh?

886
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:16,130
I mean, it's just that...

887
01:10:16,130 --> 01:10:20,650
Yeah, since Uto's not playing Romeo, the whole plan kinda fell apart.

888
01:10:24,890 --> 01:10:28,020
Thank you for being considerate of me.

889
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:33,520
But I'm fine, really.

890
01:10:35,270 --> 01:10:37,670
I'll keep trying without giving up.

891
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:42,110
I see. Well, we'll help out too.

892
01:10:42,110 --> 01:10:42,880
Yeah.

893
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:46,910
Thank you!

894
01:10:48,660 --> 01:10:50,320
Ah, it's Uto.

895
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:51,500
Huh?

896
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:56,560
That's Kurino from the cheer squad, isn't it?

897
01:10:57,240 --> 01:11:00,190
Wait, is that what I think it is?

898
01:11:05,150 --> 01:11:07,420
I just wanted to tell you how I feel...

899
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:09,160
Thank you.

900
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:10,600
Yep, she's totally confessing.

901
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,910
I'll accept your feelings.

902
01:11:13,310 --> 01:11:14,920
After this, I'll give up...

903
01:11:15,260 --> 01:11:16,980
So, just this one last thing...

904
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:21,210
Won't you kiss me?

905
01:11:21,650 --> 01:11:22,900
Huh?

906
01:11:25,570 --> 01:11:27,100
Sure.

907
01:11:27,330 --> 01:11:28,530
Huh?!

908
01:11:33,870 --> 01:11:34,980
Hey!

909
01:11:37,590 --> 01:11:39,050
Ms. Isaku?

910
01:11:41,730 --> 01:11:45,260
So you'd do that kind of thing with anyone, huh?

911
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:49,650
I hate you, Keiya!

912
01:11:54,390 --> 01:11:56,620
- H-Hey! Uto!
- Why are you just standing there?!

913
01:11:56,620 --> 01:11:57,520
Go after her, quick!

914
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:59,150
Come on, Uto, hurry!

915
01:11:59,150 --> 01:12:00,880
- Why are you frozen there?
- What's with that face?

916
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:21,960
Hello? It's me.

917
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:24,220
Yeah, that's right.

918
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:28,550
Yeah, probably tonight.

919
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:36,920
Alright, let's call it a day.

920
01:12:37,350 --> 01:12:39,170
We can still use this place a bit longer, though.

921
01:12:39,170 --> 01:12:42,730
If anyone stays to practice, make sure to lock up after, okay?

922
01:12:42,730 --> 01:12:43,860
Okay!

923
01:12:47,820 --> 01:12:50,030
- Isaku, you staying?
- Yes.

924
01:12:50,030 --> 01:12:53,480
You should just go home. You've had a rough day.

925
01:12:54,450 --> 01:12:58,420
But I'm bad at this. I'll just hold everyone back.

926
01:12:58,420 --> 01:13:01,440
Want me to stay and help you practice?

927
01:13:02,090 --> 01:13:03,730
Oh, please do.

928
01:13:04,670 --> 01:13:06,300
Not necessary.

929
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:11,510
Tanuki, please stay.

930
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:14,700
Got it.

931
01:13:28,340 --> 01:13:30,660
- H-Hey, wait!
- Hey, hey, hey!

932
01:13:30,660 --> 01:13:34,350
Uto, over here. We need to talk.

933
01:13:37,870 --> 01:13:39,730
What do you want to talk about?

934
01:13:42,430 --> 01:13:43,500
If there's nothing, I'll leave.

935
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:48,130
Let me say this first, you're seriously horrible.

936
01:13:48,130 --> 01:13:50,840
Like, the absolute horrible guy ever!

937
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:54,530
I've been wanting to ask, how do you really feel about Isaku?

938
01:13:54,530 --> 01:13:55,890
She's the most important person to me.

939
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:56,890
Huh?!

940
01:13:56,890 --> 01:14:00,770
Then why'd you try to kiss another girl?!

941
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:04,150
Every second spent arguing about kissing,

942
01:14:04,150 --> 01:14:07,900
I wanted to use it to get back to Ms. Isaku instead.

943
01:14:08,530 --> 01:14:14,010
It satisfied her and was the quickest way to end it, that's all.

944
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:24,750
Hey, is he for real?

945
01:14:24,750 --> 01:14:26,090
Yeah, yeah.

946
01:14:26,090 --> 01:14:29,300
I always thought he was weird, but...

947
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:30,840
This is next-level.

948
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:33,190
He's a total super-weirdo!

949
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:37,810
Ando, Katsuki. Excuse me, I should get going.

950
01:14:37,810 --> 01:14:40,180
Ah, wait a sec.

951
01:14:42,250 --> 01:14:46,330
Even if, and that's a huge if, you had a reason like that...

952
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:51,390
I think Isaku got hurt.

953
01:14:51,390 --> 01:14:57,680
At the very least, she can't feel like she's being cherished.

954
01:15:02,670 --> 01:15:06,220
I see. Understood.

955
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:08,730
Thanks.

956
01:15:14,050 --> 01:15:16,100
Does he really understand?

957
01:15:16,510 --> 01:15:19,790
Hmm... I'm worried.

958
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:24,560
Satonaka, where is Isaku?

959
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:29,190
She went to buy drinks for everyone. Now that I think about it she's late.

960
01:15:29,190 --> 01:15:30,570
Okay, one more time.

961
01:15:38,030 --> 01:15:41,770
I really am a horrible guy.

962
01:15:47,380 --> 01:15:49,130
Isaku?

963
01:15:50,170 --> 01:15:51,480
Isaku!

964
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:54,230
Isaku.

965
01:15:58,660 --> 01:16:02,560
Morning, Isaku. You're finally awake, huh?

966
01:16:04,370 --> 01:16:08,810
It's fine. If you stay quiet we won't stab you, okay?

967
01:16:08,810 --> 01:16:12,060
Hey Mikio, what are we gonna do with that girl?

968
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:14,700
- Pass her to us too.
- Shut up.

969
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:16,240
Come on, just a little.

970
01:16:20,030 --> 01:16:22,330
It's still too early.

971
01:16:28,670 --> 01:16:33,150
Oh dear. Looks like it wasn't that quick after all.

972
01:16:43,390 --> 01:16:45,080
Right, Kei?

973
01:16:50,670 --> 01:16:51,940
Ms. Isaku.

974
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:53,710
Don't move, Kei.

975
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:57,260
I'll stab Isaku, you know?

976
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:00,510
What's your purpose?

977
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:04,220
You said it before, didn't you?

978
01:17:05,140 --> 01:17:08,000
That I just wanted to be friends.

979
01:17:08,460 --> 01:17:10,440
Then let go of Ms. Isaku.

980
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:13,070
Geez, you're so impatient, Kei.

981
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:15,900
What are you planning to do?

982
01:17:19,230 --> 01:17:23,260
I'm bored... day after day.

983
01:17:23,540 --> 01:17:27,440
Everything's boring. I don't even know if I'm alive or dead.

984
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:31,670
And lately gramp's been noisy, so we can't even fight properly.

985
01:17:32,230 --> 01:17:35,860
We can't hang out at lots of places anymore.

986
01:17:39,910 --> 01:17:42,890
But I got to meet you, Kei.

987
01:17:46,290 --> 01:17:51,190
At that moment I got this thrill! I want that feeling.

988
01:17:53,790 --> 01:17:56,320
I asked what are you planning?

989
01:18:06,890 --> 01:18:10,080
I'm going to hurt Isaku right now.

990
01:18:12,940 --> 01:18:17,230
I thought this would be a good way to make you furious.

991
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:22,180
It's gonna be hell, huh?

992
01:18:26,510 --> 01:18:27,630
Ms. Isaku!

993
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:38,010
Ms. Isaku!

994
01:18:41,150 --> 01:18:43,720
Geezers like you should stop cosplaying!

995
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:52,790
Ms. Isaku!

996
01:18:55,150 --> 01:18:57,960
Where should I start, I wonder?

997
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:03,660
Arm? Leg? Maybe the face, huh?

998
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:07,930
This guy is totally underestimating me.

999
01:19:08,540 --> 01:19:10,480
Ms. Isaku!

1000
01:19:11,330 --> 01:19:13,830
Where should I do it, I wonder?

1001
01:19:13,830 --> 01:19:15,630
Don't mess with me.

1002
01:19:18,670 --> 01:19:24,730
I won't let my youth be wasted on your pathetic, messed-up teenage crap.

1003
01:19:25,220 --> 01:19:28,790
I refuse to have my youth exploited!

1004
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:31,620
Ow...

1005
01:20:03,050 --> 01:20:04,550
Ms. Isaku!

1006
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:16,450
Are you hurt?

1007
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:22,000
I'm okay... I think.

1008
01:20:27,130 --> 01:20:29,640
I'm sorry I put you through that scare.

1009
01:20:41,050 --> 01:20:44,650
Amazing. It's just like you, Kei.

1010
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:51,950
Keiya, no!

1011
01:20:56,080 --> 01:21:00,750
Ms. Isaku, he did something unforgivable.

1012
01:21:04,490 --> 01:21:05,800
No!

1013
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,550
The school play will get canceled, you know?!

1014
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:11,930
What?

1015
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:16,830
All the work everyone's put in so far

1016
01:21:16,830 --> 01:21:21,040
can't be ruined by something so stupid. No way.

1017
01:21:22,540 --> 01:21:26,180
It was only attempted, after all.

1018
01:21:41,630 --> 01:21:42,460
Understood.

1019
01:21:42,460 --> 01:21:44,050
Wait. So you get it?

1020
01:21:46,150 --> 01:21:47,920
After the school festival

1021
01:21:49,970 --> 01:21:53,100
don't you ever show your face to me again.

1022
01:21:55,620 --> 01:21:57,560
Isn't that too soft?

1023
01:21:59,420 --> 01:22:01,290
Absolutely.

1024
01:22:08,850 --> 01:22:10,950
You still don't get it.

1025
01:22:31,430 --> 01:22:32,800
Tenma

1026
01:22:35,830 --> 01:22:38,400
Mr. Mikio, where are you right now?

1027
01:22:38,450 --> 01:22:40,730
You even took a car without permission.

1028
01:22:40,990 --> 01:22:44,540
You've got poor supervision, Mr. Glasses.

1029
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:48,450
This is Uto of the Senagaki group.

1030
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:51,930
What's going on?

1031
01:22:51,930 --> 01:22:57,100
Your Mikio tried to assault our precious Ms. Isaku.

1032
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:00,640
Are you listening?

1033
01:23:01,350 --> 01:23:02,850
Ah, y-yes.

1034
01:23:03,940 --> 01:23:08,810
For now, we don't want to make this into a bigger issue.

1035
01:23:08,810 --> 01:23:12,420
But if anything like this happens again,

1036
01:23:12,420 --> 01:23:15,320
neither the boss nor the clan will be spared.

1037
01:23:15,820 --> 01:23:20,900
Anyone who lays a hand on my woman will definitely pay the price.

1038
01:23:26,980 --> 01:23:29,690
Otowa Festival

1039
01:23:30,260 --> 01:23:34,110
Welcome to Otowa Festival!

1040
01:23:44,650 --> 01:23:47,750
Alright, it's finally time for the school festival.

1041
01:23:45,630 --> 01:23:47,750
Otowa Festival

1042
01:23:49,610 --> 01:23:53,420
But our Romeo, Tanuki, hasn't shown up to school!

1043
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:55,490
What?

1044
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:03,430
Excuse me! I can play Romeo.

1045
01:24:03,750 --> 01:24:05,710
You're supposed to be Tybalt.

1046
01:24:05,710 --> 01:24:07,610
I already memorized all the lines.

1047
01:24:07,610 --> 01:24:10,410
And Romeo has way more scenes than Tybalt anyway.

1048
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:13,590
I can pull off Romeo perfectly.

1049
01:24:21,010 --> 01:24:21,930
Alright!

1050
01:24:21,930 --> 01:24:24,810
Then we'll let Uto play Romeo! I'll handle Tybalt myself!

1051
01:24:24,810 --> 01:24:27,930
Costume team, fix the outfit quickly! I'll help too!

1052
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:31,280
Okay, let's go! Ready, set!

1053
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:33,730
Go~!

1054
01:24:34,190 --> 01:24:35,990
When our...

1055
01:24:37,990 --> 01:24:44,500
When our hands meet like this,
it becomes a sacred kiss...

1056
01:24:47,250 --> 01:24:51,340
Ah, you carried out your duty well.

1057
01:24:51,340 --> 01:24:52,670
Uto!

1058
01:24:54,550 --> 01:24:56,050
Ms. Kaori.

1059
01:24:56,510 --> 01:25:01,240
I couldn't resist coming~
Wow, that high school uniform?

1060
01:25:02,180 --> 01:25:05,330
It really doesn't suit you! Hilarious!

1061
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:09,320
Ms. Isaku, she's...

1062
01:25:09,320 --> 01:25:12,880
"Ms. Isaku"? Oh, so that's her?

1063
01:25:15,450 --> 01:25:19,200
Wow, you're so adorable.

1064
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:21,430
I wanna take her home.

1065
01:25:23,510 --> 01:25:27,890
I'm Kaori Sekiya, I run a members-only club.

1066
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:32,210
Ah, thank you very much.

1067
01:25:32,210 --> 01:25:35,820
I'm Isaku Senagaki.

1068
01:25:36,670 --> 01:25:38,030
Nice to meet you.

1069
01:25:38,930 --> 01:25:40,740
What brought you here today?

1070
01:25:42,050 --> 01:25:46,120
I came to check out your so-called high school life. Seemed interesting.

1071
01:25:47,810 --> 01:25:50,250
In a place meant for bright young students,

1072
01:25:50,250 --> 01:25:54,110
it's scary to think someone like you are mixed in here.

1073
01:25:55,370 --> 01:26:01,180
Ah, my throat's dry. Could you grab me something to drink?

1074
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:08,540
Understood.

1075
01:26:12,210 --> 01:26:15,290
Let's sit down, Isaku.

1076
01:26:16,670 --> 01:26:17,400
Okay.

1077
01:26:31,870 --> 01:26:35,670
Isn't it tough, living with someone that overprotective?

1078
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:39,860
It can be hard sometimes,

1079
01:26:44,660 --> 01:26:46,510
but it's fun too.

1080
01:26:52,170 --> 01:26:55,150
Oh come on, you're seriously too cute.

1081
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:03,490
Don't worry, I'm rooting for you, Isaku!

1082
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:09,790
Um...

1083
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:18,860
K-Kaori, are you... Keiya's...

1084
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:25,050
...girlfriend?!

1085
01:27:29,450 --> 01:27:31,600
Nope, I'm not.

1086
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:33,640
Huh?

1087
01:27:34,290 --> 01:27:37,860
I'm not, and I never was.

1088
01:27:39,050 --> 01:27:42,720
I-I see...

1089
01:27:43,430 --> 01:27:46,680
Well, we did fool around a little back in the day.

1090
01:27:50,830 --> 01:27:52,370
Did that shock you?

1091
01:27:54,210 --> 01:27:58,920
I... I figured that might have happened.

1092
01:28:01,650 --> 01:28:03,050
But still...

1093
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:08,490
You're heading home already?

1094
01:28:09,570 --> 01:28:12,040
I have to make breakfast for Ms. Isaku.

1095
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:14,390
She's the boss's granddaughter, right?

1096
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:17,200
Must be tough, playing babysitter too.

1097
01:28:17,460 --> 01:28:18,980
You've got it wrong.

1098
01:28:19,590 --> 01:28:23,440
I'm her family and her friend.

1099
01:28:24,690 --> 01:28:29,530
To her, I'm her whole world.

1100
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:38,750
And to me, she's my world.

1101
01:28:41,230 --> 01:28:46,160
To Uto, anyone other than you

1102
01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:50,400
might as well be a rock lying on the road.

1103
01:28:54,510 --> 01:28:59,900
Tybalt, you dare ruin tonight's feast?!

1104
01:28:59,900 --> 01:29:03,030
But uncle, that man is a villain!

1105
01:29:04,510 --> 01:29:09,890
I never knew Keiya felt that way...

1106
01:29:16,270 --> 01:29:17,940
Ugh, my acting was so stiff!

1107
01:29:17,940 --> 01:29:20,500
Nah, nah, it's fine, don't worry about it.

1108
01:29:24,610 --> 01:29:26,080
Keiya...

1109
01:29:36,540 --> 01:29:39,940
Ah... how beautiful she is.

1110
01:29:40,460 --> 01:29:43,960
Have I ever truly been in love before?

1111
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:46,440
No. Never, not once.

1112
01:29:47,670 --> 01:29:52,290
Because tonight, I've seen true beauty for the first time.

1113
01:29:52,820 --> 01:29:57,020
Right now... on this stage...

1114
01:29:57,350 --> 01:30:03,340
When the dance ends, I want to go to her, to touch her hand.

1115
01:30:04,810 --> 01:30:10,070
It's okay not to hide how I feel anymore, right?

1116
01:30:13,170 --> 01:30:20,390
If my unworthy hand defiles your purity,

1117
01:30:21,540 --> 01:30:23,460
please forgive me.

1118
01:30:37,180 --> 01:30:41,870
When our hands come together like this,

1119
01:30:42,190 --> 01:30:44,740
it becomes a sacred kiss.

1120
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:46,800
Oooh!

1121
01:30:46,930 --> 01:30:53,360
It'd be cruel to scold hands that fulfilled their duty so well.

1122
01:30:54,070 --> 01:31:00,250
If this were an ordinary love, I should stop here...

1123
01:31:01,160 --> 01:31:02,580
But...

1124
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:04,480
But still...

1125
01:31:05,130 --> 01:31:07,650
If you can forgive my touch,

1126
01:31:09,970 --> 01:31:13,930
then please forgive my lips too.

1127
01:31:15,640 --> 01:31:18,010
But I...

1128
01:31:46,840 --> 01:31:49,990
Looks like the lovey-dovey plan worked, huh?

1129
01:31:50,260 --> 01:31:53,130
Yeah. But that took long enough, huh?

1130
01:31:54,510 --> 01:31:56,720
- That was so good!
- Seriously amazing!

1131
01:31:56,720 --> 01:31:58,720
- Really?
- You did great!

1132
01:31:58,720 --> 01:32:02,850
Hey, wasn't that scene where they stared at each other too intense?!

1133
01:32:12,530 --> 01:32:14,400
Isaku!

1134
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:15,200
Y-Yes!

1135
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:17,990
That was your best ever! Like, on another level!

1136
01:32:17,990 --> 01:32:20,990
That was so awesome! My heart skipped a beat!

1137
01:32:20,990 --> 01:32:23,290
- Huh? Really?
- Yeah!

1138
01:32:23,290 --> 01:32:25,290
Hey, let's take a picture!

1139
01:32:26,120 --> 01:32:27,110
Is that okay?

1140
01:32:27,110 --> 01:32:30,730
Of course! Uto! Hey, Uto!

1141
01:32:31,140 --> 01:32:33,130
- Let's take a Romeo and Juliet photo!
- Okay.

1142
01:32:33,130 --> 01:32:34,800
Hey, let's all take a picture together!

1143
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:37,470
Yeah! Everyone, gather around!

1144
01:32:38,260 --> 01:32:39,660
Hurry up!

1145
01:32:40,100 --> 01:32:41,410
Here goes!

1146
01:32:42,020 --> 01:32:45,350
Okay! Three, two, one!

1147
01:32:52,860 --> 01:32:55,990
All school festival committee members,

1148
01:32:55,990 --> 01:33:01,030
please gather in the schoolyard for the campfire preparations.

1149
01:33:01,580 --> 01:33:03,290
I repeat.

1150
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:17,760
The festival's already over.

1151
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:21,620
I told you never to show your face to me again, didn't I?

1152
01:33:23,680 --> 01:33:28,390
Well, I wasn't planning on showing up anyway.

1153
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:30,630
Just here to handle the expulsion paperwork.

1154
01:33:31,060 --> 01:33:32,670
- Expulsion?
- Yeah.

1155
01:33:33,610 --> 01:33:36,330
Gramps gave me quite the beating.

1156
01:33:37,490 --> 01:33:39,360
Ow, ow...

1157
01:33:41,410 --> 01:33:45,760
I figured today'd be the last time I'd see you and Kei...

1158
01:33:46,370 --> 01:33:48,130
Gonna miss you guys.

1159
01:33:48,520 --> 01:33:50,500
You don't mean that at all.

1160
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:52,110
I do, actually.

1161
01:33:53,390 --> 01:33:58,120
But... maybe I'll just go home like this.

1162
01:33:59,590 --> 01:34:02,200
I'm heading back to class, so move.

1163
01:34:13,730 --> 01:34:18,650
Even when I'm gone, you'll still be in danger.

1164
01:34:18,650 --> 01:34:21,630
As long as you're with Kei. Always.

1165
01:34:22,200 --> 01:34:23,760
I pity you.

1166
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:28,830
"Pity"?

1167
01:34:31,970 --> 01:34:37,480
It's true. He's someone I shouldn't love, so I tried to stay away.

1168
01:34:38,050 --> 01:34:42,660
Because living beside someone in the yakuza world is painful...

1169
01:34:43,550 --> 01:34:44,410
But...

1170
01:34:49,640 --> 01:34:52,380
I always chose it.

1171
01:34:55,380 --> 01:35:00,680
I wanted to stay with Keiya more than anything.

1172
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:08,560
You don't have to pity me.

1173
01:35:10,620 --> 01:35:15,960
I'm doing this because it's what I want.

1174
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:23,490
Thank you either way.

1175
01:35:24,510 --> 01:35:25,660
Huh?

1176
01:35:26,260 --> 01:35:30,620
Thanks to you, I figured out how I really feel.

1177
01:35:43,780 --> 01:35:44,990
Keiya.

1178
01:35:45,410 --> 01:35:46,470
Yes?

1179
01:35:49,330 --> 01:35:55,790
When I started high school, I wanted an ordinary youth.

1180
01:35:57,090 --> 01:36:03,520
Yes. You wanted to go to school, make friends, and just live normally...

1181
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:07,620
Yeah, I wanted to fall in love like a normal girl.

1182
01:36:12,230 --> 01:36:13,640
But...

1183
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:22,270
Maybe that was just an excuse to give up on you.

1184
01:36:28,620 --> 01:36:30,920
Because in the end,

1185
01:36:32,700 --> 01:36:35,210
I want to stay by your side.

1186
01:36:47,590 --> 01:36:49,140
I like you.

1187
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:56,790
I like you, Keiya.

1188
01:37:02,110 --> 01:37:05,860
I'm not saying you have to give me an answer right now or anything.

1189
01:37:05,860 --> 01:37:08,650
I just wanted you to know how I feel...

1190
01:37:12,540 --> 01:37:14,150
Ms. Isaku.

1191
01:37:15,290 --> 01:37:16,370
Hm?

1192
01:37:17,170 --> 01:37:19,860
Thank you for telling me.

1193
01:37:26,670 --> 01:37:32,450
I've always wanted to understand what this feeling was....

1194
01:37:34,430 --> 01:37:35,850
Me too.

1195
01:37:38,730 --> 01:37:41,110
I like you so much, Ms. Isaku.

1196
01:37:48,970 --> 01:37:54,300
You're my family, my friend.

1197
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:56,850
And from now on...

1198
01:37:58,070 --> 01:38:00,080
You're my girlfriend.

1199
01:38:04,840 --> 01:38:06,340
Yeah.

1200
01:38:27,940 --> 01:38:31,060
Huh? No reaction?

1201
01:38:32,580 --> 01:38:36,090
Wait! You look totally shocked!

1202
01:38:36,620 --> 01:38:37,750
Huh?

1203
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:45,400
I just didn't expect something like this to come from you.

1204
01:38:46,590 --> 01:38:50,880
You're always the one clinging to me.

1205
01:38:52,260 --> 01:38:56,530
Don't worry, I won't do anything.

1206
01:38:58,810 --> 01:39:01,270
You won't do anything?

1207
01:39:02,850 --> 01:39:07,800
Something like that is worth waiting, right?

1208
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:19,700
Keiya.

1209
01:39:21,460 --> 01:39:22,760
Yes?

1210
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:29,380
Okay!

1211
01:39:32,510 --> 01:39:33,530
What?

1212
01:39:36,850 --> 01:39:39,600
O-Okay!

1213
01:39:48,150 --> 01:39:49,760
Ms. Isaku.

1214
01:40:03,500 --> 01:40:06,520
I'll definitely not stop this time, okay?
