Hey hey hey hey...

197
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:38,660
Yamate-san, until he entered a Japanese university

198
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:38,660
Apparently he lived in Brazil.

199
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:42,495
It feels like it's not like Japanese

200
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:42,495
There is.

201
00:13:42,495 --> 00:13:45,330
It's cool though

202
00:13:42,495 --> 00:13:45,330
I mean passionate ➡

203
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:48,000
He feels like a Latin man.

204
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,561
(Miyazaki) Is there really a girlfriend?

205
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,561
(Ueno) I'm here.

Yamate-kun

207
00:13:52,561 --> 00:13:56,000
Apparently he's a pretty playboy.

208
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,330
Maki-chan should be careful too.

209
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:01,495
That's definitely not possible.

210
00:14:01,495 --> 00:14:03,165
Hmm.

The cooking class teacher is already here.

216

Ah, sorry.

217
00:14:24,165 --> 00:14:27,165

New jewelry

224
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I bought it.

225
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000

Yes, how about you guys?

228
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
gentlemen….

229
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,165
This is difficult...

230
00:15:03,165 --> 00:15:06,825
What is Kyoichi doing today?

231
00:15:06,825 --> 00:15:10,825
I seem to be tired lately

232
00:15:06,825 --> 00:15:10,825
I think I'm sleeping at home.

233
00:15:10,825 --> 00:15:14,000
picture~! It's a holiday, isn't it?

234
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,825
Dinner or something

235
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,825
Don't you go out to eat?

236
00:15:17,825 --> 00:15:22,000
Eating out for two

237
00:15:17,825 --> 00:15:22,000
I haven't done it for a long time...

238
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,330
Taku... Kyoichi has been in college since he was in college.

239
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:30,330
It's not going to change forever. Hehe...

240
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:42,660
Maki-chan, have tea over here.

241
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:42,660
yes!

242
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,495
Is it heavy? Menstrual pain.

243
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:59,495
Yeah…

244
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:59,495
I feel like it's getting heavier every year.

245
00:15:59,495 --> 00:16:03,660
Maki's company

246
00:15:59,495 --> 00:16:03,660
Are you not taking period leave?

247
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:07,825
It's the natural right of a working woman.

248
00:16:07,825 --> 00:16:12,825
If it's tough

249
00:16:07,825 --> 00:16:12,825
Why not consult a gynecologist?

250
00:16:12,825 --> 00:16:17,330
Yes... I'll go next time.

251
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,495
Maki-chan and Ko

252
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,495
Are you not thinking about children?

253
00:16:27,825 --> 00:16:33,495
I want it

254
00:16:27,825 --> 00:16:33,495
I'm thinking about it...

255
00:16:33,495 --> 00:16:37,033
Because he's insensitive

256
00:16:33,495 --> 00:16:37,033
If you want kids ➡

257
00:16:37,033 --> 00:16:42,660
I have to say that I want it

258
00:16:37,033 --> 00:16:42,660
It won't convey it?

259
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:46,000
I too, like Yorishima-senpai ➡

260
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,495
What I want to say is clear

261
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,495
I wish I could tell you.

262
00:16:52,495 --> 00:16:57,825
Really Kyoichi

263
00:16:52,495 --> 00:16:57,825
He's a weird guy, isn't he?

264
00:16:57,825 --> 00:17:00,957
Hehe.

265
00:16:57,825 --> 00:17:00,957
Hehe.

266
00:17:00,957 --> 00:17:05,000
So after the classroom ➡

267
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,660
A story about the club's summer training camp

268
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,660
Get excited.

269
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:16,660
Since then, Yorishima-senpai

270
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:16,660
It's still beautiful.

271
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:21,330
Yorishima Senpai

272
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:21,330
He gave me this as a souvenir.

273
00:17:24,165 --> 00:17:26,330
Hmm.

274
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,165
Yeah! delicious.

275
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,165
It's tasty, isn't it?

276
00:17:35,165 --> 00:17:37,825
I'm tired.

277
00:17:35,165 --> 00:17:37,825
Ah, Yamate-san.

278
00:17:37,825 --> 00:17:41,165
Today's drinking party

279
00:17:37,825 --> 00:17:41,165
Just like usual.

280
00:17:37,825 --> 00:17:41,165
ＯＫ。

oh! Yay.

302
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,495
Unusual.

303
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:51,330
Can everyone add tomatoes?

304
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:51,330
Yes, it's fine.

Let Yamate do it.

307
00:18:54,825 --> 00:18:59,330
As expected of Yamate-san.

308
00:18:54,825 --> 00:18:59,330
No no, it's normal.

309
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:02,660

Oh no... not that much

334
00:19:37,495 --> 00:19:41,660
I won't take part in drinking parties or anything ➡

335

Don't drink at home at all?

337

Oh, too... my husband too

338
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,330

Wow, your husband

Hey.

Isn't it the main character of Tomata-san's life?

347
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:20,825
What happened?

Hey, a bit

Do you play this kind of game?

381
00:21:55,264 --> 00:21:58,693
