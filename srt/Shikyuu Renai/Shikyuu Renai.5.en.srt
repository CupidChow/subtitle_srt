What happened to someone who is in utero love?

194
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,495
picture!?

195
00:09:53,495 --> 00:09:55,825
So that's

196
00:09:53,495 --> 00:09:55,825
Not that...

197
00:09:55,825 --> 00:10:01,330
Are you okay. I'm always

198
00:09:55,825 --> 00:10:01,330
Isn't he on Maki's side?

199
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:07,000
And what about after that?

200
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:07,000
Please tell me more in detail.

201
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:17,330
What do you mean...

202
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:17,330
If you're with that person ➡

203
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:21,495
Emotions are swayed. ➡

204
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:24,825
I'm irritated or hurt

205
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:31,660
I thought so

206
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:31,660
It was fun and I was laughing...

207
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:39,000
Wow... Anyway, for now

208
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:39,000
Why not try sleeping with that person?

209
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
teeth!?

210
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Because about that person

211
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Are you worried?

212
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,330
I wonder if the body is compatible

213
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,330
I don't know.

214
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:53,330
If it's not compatible, it's something that starts

215
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:53,330
Because it won't start.

216
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:56,561
No, is that a problem?

217
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:56,561
Yeah.

218
00:10:56,561 --> 00:11:00,330
Because the mind and body

219
00:10:56,561 --> 00:11:00,330
Both are just as important, right?

220
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:03,495
That's true even in love.

221
00:11:03,495 --> 00:11:08,165
it is….

222
00:11:03,495 --> 00:11:08,165
Even if you worry, you have an answer

223
00:11:03,495 --> 00:11:08,165
Because it won't come out ➡

224
00:11:08,165 --> 00:11:11,495
If you can tell the uterus

225
00:11:08,165 --> 00:11:11,495
Isn't it okay?

226
00:11:14,033 --> 00:11:17,330
Ha...Maki-chan ➡

227
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,825
Suppress your feelings ➡

228
00:11:19,825 --> 00:11:25,165
Without hurting anyone

229
00:11:19,825 --> 00:11:25,165
Are you thinking about living?

230
00:11:25,165 --> 00:11:30,000
I'm that

231
00:11:25,165 --> 00:11:30,000
I don't think it's impossible.

232
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:40,000
Maki-chan is

233
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:40,000
He's still too kind.

234
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
For parents today

235
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Was it not suitable?

236
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,330
(Rina) Is it just one parent?

237
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,330
My mother is working on Saturdays too.

238
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:58,000
is that so.

239
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,165
It's almost blank.

240
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,165
What university is your interest? ➡

241
00:12:02,165 --> 00:12:06,495
Things I want to do in the future

242
00:12:02,165 --> 00:12:06,495
Is there anything?

243
00:12:06,495 --> 00:12:11,165
(Rina) Hmm...➡

244
00:12:11,165 --> 00:12:14,363
There's nothing in particular.

245
00:12:14,363 --> 00:12:18,660
What's other than marriage

246
00:12:14,363 --> 00:12:18,660
It's decided though.

247
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:22,825
teeth?

248
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:22,825
I'm not interested in marriage.

249
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:25,660
Or rather

250
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:25,660
I don't think I want to do it.

251
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,660
Professor Tomata is married, right?

252
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:33,330
Why do you want to marry?

253
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:33,330
Did you think so?

254
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:37,000
Why is it...

255
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,330
With the person you like

256
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,330
Is it because you want to be with me for the rest of your life?

257
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:46,000
Nakajima-san is

258
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:46,000
You have a smartphone, right?

259
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,495
yes.

260
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,495
It feels the same way.

261
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:55,396
Without it, you can't live

262
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:55,396
Not there but ➡

263
00:12:55,396 --> 00:13:01,330
It would be quite inconvenient if not.

264
00:12:55,396 --> 00:13:01,330
It's the same.

265
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:06,495
If you're not married

266
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:06,495
It's very inconvenient to live.

267
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:10,165
Being snooped

268
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:10,165
I'm being imagined strangely

269
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:13,000
Even though I haven't heard it

270
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:13,000
Take advice.

271
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,165
There are some troublesome things that can be avoided when you're married

272
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,165
There are a lot.

273
00:13:18,165 --> 00:13:22,660
Professor Tomata

274
00:13:18,165 --> 00:13:22,660
It's really interesting.

275
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:26,825
What's interesting

276
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:26,825
No one will tell me though.

277
00:13:26,825 --> 00:13:31,330
And...

278
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:34,330
With the person you like

279
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:34,330
Being together forever ➡

280
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:39,330
It's not just about marriage.

281
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:41,396
Hehe...

282
00:13:41,396 --> 00:13:46,000
I've heard the teacher's story

283
00:13:41,396 --> 00:13:46,000
I was a little relieved.

284
00:14:00,264 --> 00:14:04,660
(Send Island)

285
00:14:00,264 --> 00:14:04,660
((both the mind and body

286
00:14:00,264 --> 00:14:04,660
Isn't it just as important? ➡

287
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:09,000
If you can tell the uterus

288
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:09,000
Isn't it okay? ))

Sweet and salty

299
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:33,330
Which do you prefer?

300
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:36,825
Haha... I was surprised.

301
00:15:36,825 --> 00:15:41,165
Um... just by chance

302
00:15:36,825 --> 00:15:41,165
Because I was near my office.

303
00:15:41,165 --> 00:15:45,000
I see. thank you.

304
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,561
This is really delicious. Hehe.

305
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,561
Hehehe...

306
00:15:54,561 --> 00:15:59,198
Why Yamate-san?

307
00:15:54,561 --> 00:15:59,198
Did you join this company?

308
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:02,528
Oh, will you hear that?

309
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,528
yes.

310
00:16:06,561 --> 00:16:09,627
The house is roughly

311
00:16:06,561 --> 00:16:09,627
Rather than for myself ➡

312
00:16:09,627 --> 00:16:12,726
Should I build it for someone?

313
00:16:12,726 --> 00:16:16,792
Love for someone you love

314
00:16:12,726 --> 00:16:16,792
Compassion or something.

315
00:16:16,792 --> 00:16:20,594
That kind of thing

316
00:16:16,792 --> 00:16:20,594
I feel like it's packed with lots.

317
00:16:20,594 --> 00:16:25,033
Building a house

318
00:16:20,594 --> 00:16:25,033
I think it shows your personality.

319
00:16:25,033 --> 00:16:28,462
That's what's interesting.

320
00:16:28,462 --> 00:16:30,132
Wow.

321
00:16:30,132 --> 00:16:35,693
And even after it's finished, it takes time

322
00:16:30,132 --> 00:16:35,693
It's growing more and more.

323
00:16:35,693 --> 00:16:38,726
It looks like a living thing and feels like a body temperature.

324
00:16:38,726 --> 00:16:43,693
Ah...it's kind of wonderful.

325
00:16:43,693 --> 00:16:47,429
Say that, I myself

326
00:16:43,693 --> 00:16:47,429
Live your life as selfish as ever➡

327
00:16:47,429 --> 00:16:49,957
For someone

328
00:16:47,429 --> 00:16:49,957
What is a life like building a house?

329
00:16:49,957 --> 00:16:52,330
It's the opposite of life though.

330
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:57,825
Why Tomata-san?

331
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:57,825
Did you want to join this company?

332
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:03,660
Yeah….

333
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:03,660
Yeah?

334
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:09,429
If it's an interview then definitely

335
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:09,429
It's something you shouldn't say but ➡

336
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:12,132
I'm telling the truth.

337
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:14,528
Yeah.

338
00:17:14,528 --> 00:17:17,858
Because I got a job offer.

339
00:17:17,858 --> 00:17:19,363
law.

340
00:17:19,363 --> 00:17:23,825
I'm basically not confident in myself.

341
00:17:23,825 --> 00:17:28,528
That's why I also have job hunting

342
00:17:23,825 --> 00:17:28,528
It didn't work at all.

343
00:17:28,528 --> 00:17:35,957
At that moment, finally

344
00:17:28,528 --> 00:17:35,957
I got a job offer from this company.

345
00:17:35,957 --> 00:17:37,660
Even if I'm like this ➡

346
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:41,528
A company that thinks it's necessary

347
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:41,528
I guess there is.

348
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:46,858
So for this company

349
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:46,858
I felt like I was going to try hard.

350
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:49,627
Wow.

351
00:17:49,627 --> 00:17:52,264
Ah, are you pulling it?

352
00:17:52,264 --> 00:17:57,066
It's not pulling. Please be honest

353
00:17:52,264 --> 00:17:57,066
I felt happy.

354
00:18:00,132 --> 00:18:05,132
I actually want to try some jobs

355
00:18:00,132 --> 00:18:05,132
There was...

356
00:18:05,132 --> 00:18:07,132
What kind of work?

357
00:18:07,132 --> 00:18:11,000
I want to become a nursery teacher

358
00:18:07,132 --> 00:18:11,000
I was thinking.

359
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,594
Wow. Why?

360
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:22,000
My father wasn't at home

361
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:22,000
My mother is busy with work every day.

362
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:29,066
So I always go late at night

363
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:29,066
I was left at the nursery.

364
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:33,495
But always, childcare workers

365
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:33,495
Because he was there near me ➡

366
00:18:33,495 --> 00:18:37,000
I wasn't lonely at all.

367
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,198
So it's a wonderful job.

368
00:18:41,198 --> 00:18:46,033
When I grow up, I'll become a nursery teacher

369
00:18:41,198 --> 00:18:46,033
I thought I wanted to be.

370
00:18:46,033 --> 00:18:48,099
Wow...

371
00:18:48,099 --> 00:18:53,627
But my mother said, "I'm a nursery teacher."

372
00:18:48,099 --> 00:18:53,627
It's hard work for my salary.

373
00:18:53,627 --> 00:18:57,363
Stop it! ”

374
00:18:53,627 --> 00:18:57,363
Be told.

375
00:18:57,363 --> 00:19:02,165
I gave up immediately.

376
00:19:02,165 --> 00:19:05,957
I'm too unavailable

377
00:19:02,165 --> 00:19:05,957
I think I'll be told that.

378
00:19:05,957 --> 00:19:11,165
When I was little, I was my mother

379
00:19:05,957 --> 00:19:11,165
I don't want to be disliked ➡

380
00:19:11,165 --> 00:19:13,825
I was desperate.

381
00:19:16,099 --> 00:19:20,561
From mom

00:19:16,099 --> 00:19:20,561
If I'm not loved, I

383
00:19:20,561 --> 00:19:25,561
You won't be loved by anyone

384
00:19:20,561 --> 00:19:25,561
I'm worried about whether it's going to happen.

385
00:19:25,561 --> 00:19:31,495
It's a bit distorted, isn't it?

386
00:19:31,495 --> 00:19:38,462
Sorry, yeah!

387
00:19:31,495 --> 00:19:38,462
It's become a dark story.

388
00:19:38,462 --> 00:19:44,495
For some reason, I'm Yamate-san

389
00:19:38,462 --> 00:19:44,495
I end up speaking my true feelings.

390
00:19:47,297 --> 00:19:52,297
Tomata's true feelings

391
00:19:47,297 --> 00:19:52,297
I'm glad to hear a lot.

What do you mean, myself

00:20:03,561 --> 00:20:08,066
I don't really understand but...

395
00:20:14,099 --> 00:20:19,924
I'm going to see Tomata-san's smile

396
00:20:14,099 --> 00:20:19,924
It seems like he likes it quite a bit.

397
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:34,726
So laugh.

398
00:20:44,462 --> 00:20:48,462

00:20:51,594 --> 00:20:57,924
Hey. Before that, what about Tomata?

401
00:20:51,594 --> 00:20:57,924
I said I didn't want to fall in love ➡

402
00:20:57,924 --> 00:21:01,330
Can I withdraw it?

picture?

404
00:21:08,627 --> 00:21:12,957
I won't do it if I don't like it. Be clear.

405
00:21:19,627 --> 00:21:21,627
Don't you?

406
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:28,462
I don't like it...
