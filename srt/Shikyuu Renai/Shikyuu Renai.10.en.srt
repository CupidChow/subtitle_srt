That day, Kyoichi forced him...

14
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:07,000
I had that surgery

00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:07,000
Almost 100% ➡

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,528
You can't have children.

17
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:11,660
I don't think he's my child.

I'm not my own child

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,825
I wish they had said that.

22
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:41,429
That's right. sorry.

23
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:52,099
I... I'm happy alone

24
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:52,099
Isn't it stupid?

25
00:01:52,099 --> 00:01:54,132
That's not the case.

26
00:01:54,132 --> 00:01:56,759
Do that

27
00:01:54,132 --> 00:01:56,759
Please don't cheat.

28
00:02:01,231 --> 00:02:03,231
sorry….

29
00:02:08,363 --> 00:02:13,000
Don't deceive it, I'll tell you everything.

30
00:02:17,495 --> 00:02:20,330
What's it all?

31
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:24,495
I cut the pipe ➡

32
00:02:24,495 --> 00:02:28,231
I already have a child

33
00:02:24,495 --> 00:02:28,231
Because I didn't think I was qualified.

00:02:36,033 --> 00:02:38,033
recall

35
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:40,462
Oh... It's so good, wow...

00:02:40,462 --> 00:02:44,264
Okay... oh oh...

37
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:48,528
(Nakajima Saori) I'm too nervous.

38
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:48,528
Because it would be a pain if you dropped it

39
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:48,528
Oh...

40
00:02:48,528 --> 00:02:52,462
Well. Ah, it's okay, it's okay.

42
00:02:48,528 --> 00:02:52,462
Okay, okay.

43
00:02:52,462 --> 00:02:57,330
Good morning.

44
00:02:52,462 --> 00:02:57,330
That's cute. Okay, okay...

There's no one there...grand!

Haha... I stopped crying

48

Hey, I stopped crying.

49
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,165
Are you okay?

00:03:13,165 --> 00:03:18,066
Yeah. I'm just tired...➡

51
00:03:18,066 --> 00:03:23,396
Can I sleep for a little while? for a while

52
00:03:18,066 --> 00:03:23,396
Can you ask Rina about it?

53
00:03:23,396 --> 00:03:26,693
Yes of course. yes.

54
00:03:26,693 --> 00:03:29,330
Okay, it's good...

57
00:03:41,594 --> 00:03:44,264
First, we had a family of three.

58
00:03:44,264 --> 00:03:48,528
Just being together

59
00:03:44,264 --> 00:03:48,528
I was happy.

60
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:52,198
But...

61
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:52,198
Saori gradually stopped laughing.

62
00:03:54,198 --> 00:03:58,132
recall

63
00:03:54,198 --> 00:03:58,132
I'm home~.

64
00:04:04,825 --> 00:04:07,858
What about mom?

65
00:04:07,858 --> 00:04:12,066
(Rina) He won't come back.

66
00:04:07,858 --> 00:04:12,066
I'm hungry.

67
00:04:14,363 --> 00:04:17,462
I'll cook dinner soon

68
00:04:14,363 --> 00:04:17,462
Wait a minute.

69
00:04:26,858 --> 00:04:29,825
(Rina) Mom's meals are good.

71
00:04:42,924 --> 00:04:47,165
I don't care about me though

72
00:04:42,924 --> 00:04:47,165
Make Rina's meals.

73
00:04:47,165 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm hungry today too

74
00:04:47,165 --> 00:04:51,000
Poor thing...

75
00:04:53,198 --> 00:04:57,264
Asahi is outside

76
00:04:53,198 --> 00:04:57,264
I wish I could just work

77
00:04:57,264 --> 00:05:02,330
I'm part-time, housework, childcare

78
00:04:57,264 --> 00:05:02,330
I'm full every day!

79
00:05:07,132 --> 00:05:09,363
I know that Rina is important though ➡

80
00:05:09,363 --> 00:05:11,561
Think about my feelings too!

81
00:05:14,363 --> 00:05:18,792
I said that

82
00:05:14,363 --> 00:05:18,792
Saori is already an adult...

83
00:05:23,231 --> 00:05:26,264
Even adults

84
00:05:23,231 --> 00:05:26,264
There are times when I want to cry.

85
00:05:29,264 --> 00:05:41,924
(Saori's cry)

86
00:05:46,825 --> 00:05:49,792
(Saori)

87
00:05:46,825 --> 00:05:49,792
Isn't that person serious?

88
00:05:49,792 --> 00:05:53,825
I've only met a few times...

89
00:05:49,792 --> 00:05:53,825
sorry.

90
00:05:56,924 --> 00:05:59,000
Please forgive me.

91
00:06:04,462 --> 00:06:06,594
But it's Asahi's fault...

92
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:14,000
Because even if I'm alone...

93
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm lonely.

94
00:06:18,198 --> 00:06:25,759
Sorry...but already

95
00:06:18,198 --> 00:06:25,759
I can't believe Saori.

96
00:06:30,462 --> 00:06:35,330
What is Saori now

97
00:06:30,462 --> 00:06:35,330
I can't live together.

98
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,759
(Rina) Come on!

99
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:52,759
Ah...hey Rina...➡

100
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:57,792
Maybe mom or dad, either

101
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:57,792
If you can't live

102
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:00,066
Which is better?

103
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:11,792
Mom is good.

104
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:24,132
I see...

105
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:24,132

(Door opening and closing sound)

110
00:08:07,792 --> 00:08:12,825
Now

111
00:08:07,792 --> 00:08:12,825
But Saori is

112
00:08:07,792 --> 00:08:12,825
He didn't agree to divorce.

114
00:08:20,198 --> 00:08:24,396
Divorce filing

115
00:08:20,198 --> 00:08:24,396
Just left that day.

116
00:08:28,957 --> 00:08:32,000
That's...

117
00:08:28,957 --> 00:08:32,000
In the family register: ➡

118
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,363
Me and Saori

119
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,363
They are still married.

120
00:08:42,066 --> 00:08:44,099
This is what it is➡

121
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:50,495
Faster

122
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:50,495
I should have spoken...

123
00:08:50,495 --> 00:08:52,495
I'm really sorry.

124
00:08:57,198 --> 00:09:05,594
What I didn't talk about was

125
00:08:57,198 --> 00:09:05,594
Was it because you wanted guilty?

126
00:09:05,594 --> 00:09:08,330
Yamate-san is

127
00:09:05,594 --> 00:09:08,330
I don't want to have a family anymore ➡

128
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,561
That's what it is, right?

129
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,561
No, not that.

130
00:09:10,561 --> 00:09:14,198
Because I just said, "To me

131
00:09:10,561 --> 00:09:14,198
I'm not entitled to have children."

132
00:09:14,198 --> 00:09:18,099
You said that, right?

133
00:09:14,198 --> 00:09:18,099
it is….

134
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,858
I said that though.

135
00:09:20,858 --> 00:09:25,825
After I failed my marriage ➡

136
00:09:25,825 --> 00:09:31,165
Work and love

137
00:09:25,825 --> 00:09:31,165
I no longer became obsessed with anything.

138
00:09:31,165 --> 00:09:34,957
Or rather, I can no longer do it.

139
00:09:34,957 --> 00:09:39,000
But after meeting Maki ➡

140
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,858
Me little by little

141
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,858
My feelings have changed➡

142
00:09:42,858 --> 00:09:45,858
Now really

143
00:09:42,858 --> 00:09:45,858
I want to change.

144
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:56,726
About Yamate-san

145
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:56,726

Has it been postponed?

151
00:10:41,627 --> 00:10:44,660
Ah, that's right.

152
00:10:41,627 --> 00:10:44,660
Yamate-san is not on a business trip ➡

153
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,396
I've been rescheduled next week.

154

Wow, that's right.

No, Maki-chan

Perfect

159
00:10:55,066 --> 00:10:57,693
I thought I knew it.

yes?

164
00:11:16,693 --> 00:11:20,198
Recently, rumors have been occurring within the club.

165
00:11:20,198 --> 00:11:24,825
Maki-chan with Yamate-kun

166
00:11:20,198 --> 00:11:24,825
I think it's done.

Ah no, well

00:11:24,825 --> 00:11:28,693
It's just a rumor level though.

170
00:11:28,693 --> 00:11:34,000
But, in the event that the manager is in the ears

171
00:11:28,693 --> 00:11:34,000
Wouldn't it be a pain if you got in?

172
00:11:36,528 --> 00:11:38,660
(Koike) What!? What is this?

173
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,726

177
00:11:54,561 --> 00:11:58,264
Something like a prank

00:11:54,561 --> 00:11:58,264
It's too bad...

179

I would like you to send me an email.

196
00:12:50,066 --> 00:12:52,495
I just came back from work ➡

197
00:12:52,495 --> 00:12:54,924
I'm tired.

It's fine if it's just a little

199
00:12:54,924 --> 00:12:58,924
I want to talk directly.

And... what?

201
00:13:20,693 --> 00:13:24,330
Let's break up properly.

202
00:13:31,858 --> 00:13:35,891
Why do you want to divorce now?

203
00:13:35,891 --> 00:13:38,132
it is….

204
00:13:38,132 --> 00:13:40,528
Are there people who want to remarry?

205
00:13:52,396 --> 00:13:55,396
Asahi Hasa ➡

206
00:13:55,396 --> 00:13:58,693
I don't have a family anymore

207
00:13:55,396 --> 00:13:58,693
Wasn't he decided?

208
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:05,000
To Asahi who abandoned us ➡

209
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I don't have to be qualified to have a family.
