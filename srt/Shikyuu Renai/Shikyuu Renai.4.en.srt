(Yorishima) I fell in love with my uterus

00:07:42,231 --> 00:07:48,429
Because I was there, with my dad

115
00:07:42,231 --> 00:07:48,429
Maybe they couldn't get divorced...

192
00:12:57,165 --> 00:13:01,660

What!? Today

196
00:13:56,495 --> 00:13:59,924
Is it Maki's birthday?

197
00:13:59,924 --> 00:14:02,165
Ah...yeah.

198
00:14:02,165 --> 00:14:06,000
a little bit~. About birthday

199
00:14:02,165 --> 00:14:06,000
Stay with me.

200
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,594
That's what I invited.

201
00:14:07,594 --> 00:14:10,693
It's Maki's birthday

202
00:14:07,594 --> 00:14:10,693
If I knew, I wouldn't invite him.

203
00:14:10,693 --> 00:14:13,330
A proper birthday present

204
00:14:10,693 --> 00:14:13,330
I left it behind.

205
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:16,231
What? Are you planning to do that?

206
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:16,231
Hehe.

207
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:19,363
That's not good

208
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:19,363
What about birthdays?

209
00:14:19,363 --> 00:14:21,693
I'm not a child, so come on.

210
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:27,693
what happened?

211
00:14:27,693 --> 00:14:31,528
Kyoichi: Have you misunderstood?

212
00:14:27,693 --> 00:14:31,528
teeth?

213
00:14:31,528 --> 00:14:36,066
I like Maki-chan.

214
00:14:31,528 --> 00:14:36,066
picture?

215
00:14:36,066 --> 00:14:39,066
So take care of it.

216
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:43,924
That's what Yorishima says

217
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:43,924
Isn't that strange?

218
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:46,330
It's not strange.

219
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:50,132
you know what

220
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:50,132
What I and Kyoichi do like this ➡

221
00:14:50,132 --> 00:14:54,264
What I like about Maki-chan

222
00:14:50,132 --> 00:14:54,264
Because it's a completely different matter.

223
00:14:54,264 --> 00:14:57,495
That's incoherent.

224
00:14:57,495 --> 00:14:59,099
I'll make it clear but ➡

225
00:14:59,099 --> 00:15:02,726
I want what I want

226
00:14:59,099 --> 00:15:02,726
I just want to get it.

227
00:15:02,726 --> 00:15:05,957
Other people don't care.

228
00:15:05,957 --> 00:15:07,957
What's the story?

229
00:15:07,957 --> 00:15:11,528
About Maki-chan

230
00:15:07,957 --> 00:15:11,528
I don't want to hurt him but ➡

231
00:15:11,528 --> 00:15:13,528
As Kyoichi and I do this ➡

232
00:15:13,528 --> 00:15:17,528
As a result, it hurts

233
00:15:13,528 --> 00:15:17,528
I think it's inevitable.

234
00:15:23,264 --> 00:15:28,891
That's...

235
00:15:23,264 --> 00:15:28,891
To be happy if you're

236
00:15:28,891 --> 00:15:32,132
Does that mean that other people's misfortune can't be helped?

237
00:15:32,132 --> 00:15:34,132
That's right.

238
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:40,132
Because without hurting anyone ➡

239
00:15:40,132 --> 00:15:43,396
Get just what you want

240
00:15:40,132 --> 00:15:43,396
That's not possible.

241
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I'm happy ➡

242
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,495
To someone

243
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,495
It's not something you can give.

244
00:15:58,495 --> 00:16:05,660
So my happiness is

245
00:15:58,495 --> 00:16:05,660
You have no choice but to get it yourself.

247
00:16:27,495 --> 00:16:32,660
Yorishima... is doing this with me

248
00:16:27,495 --> 00:16:32,660
Does that mean happiness?

249

250
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:44,000

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,660
Huh, are you going home?

252
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,660
Today already

253
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,660
I lost motivation.

254
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,000
I'm not satisfied at all though.

255
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,330
That sexual desire is a little bit

256
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,330
Why not focus on Maki-chan too?

257
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:05,165
Let's stop talking about Maki.

258
00:17:05,165 --> 00:17:11,165
That's what Maki-chan

259
00:17:05,165 --> 00:17:11,165
Maybe someone else will take you?

260
00:17:11,165 --> 00:17:15,660
It's impossible for Maki only.

261
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:22,660
Kyoichi is a carefree place

262
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:22,660
It's still the same.

263
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:27,330
So buy some cake too

264
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:27,330
Please go home early.

265
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:27,330
Wait a minute.

266

270

Yes it's tasty.

271

good….

272
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I'll enjoy having this.

274
00:19:01,165 --> 00:19:08,825
I forgot to apply mayonnaise...

275
00:19:08,825 --> 00:19:13,000
Ah... so something

276
00:19:08,825 --> 00:19:13,000
It wasn't enough.

277
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,660
Ah! That's exactly right.

278
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,660
Hehehe...

279
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:22,825
I'm kidding. Or rather, me

280
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:22,825
I hate mayonnaise.

281
00:19:22,825 --> 00:19:29,825
Is that so?

282
00:19:22,825 --> 00:19:29,825
Yeah. Rather it wasn't in

283
00:19:22,825 --> 00:19:29,825
It was a relief.

284
00:19:29,825 --> 00:19:38,495
I see...

285
00:19:29,825 --> 00:19:38,495
So I was blessed in the midst of unhappiness.

286
00:19:38,495 --> 00:19:43,495
Me still

287
00:19:38,495 --> 00:19:43,495
There are only things I don't know➡

288
00:19:43,495 --> 00:19:46,330
About Tomata-senpai.

289
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:50,495
That's about me too.

290
00:19:50,495 --> 00:19:53,000
surely.

00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,495

I know it well➡

297
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:09,660
If you think about it, you don't know about it

298
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:09,660
You'll feel anxious when it comes out, right?

299
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:12,660
Conversely, about the other person

300
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:12,660
If you think you don't know anything ➡

301
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:17,165
Because you don't have to worry.

302
00:20:17,165 --> 00:20:22,165
I wonder if that's what it is...

303
00:20:22,165 --> 00:20:26,330
And take your time and take your time to relax
