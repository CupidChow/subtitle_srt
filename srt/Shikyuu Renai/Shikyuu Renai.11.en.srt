Are you okay.

20
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:05,330
I'm anemia.

21
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:11,000
But at least one day or two days

22
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm likely to be hospitalized for a test

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I went home and changed clothes

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Because I'll get what I need.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,660
