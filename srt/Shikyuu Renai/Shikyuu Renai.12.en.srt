About Kyoichi

191
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:39,330
I've always loved it.

192
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:41,462
So... why...?

193
00:13:41,462 --> 00:13:49,660
My uterine love was Kyoichi.

194
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:53,660
But I want to get married

195
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:53,660
It wasn't Kyoichi.

197
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:15,429
From now on, separate roads

198
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:15,429
Let's live freely.

199
00:14:15,429 --> 00:14:21,000
Both of us...➡

200
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Let's be happy.

good….

209
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:26,330
father…

210
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:26,330
Isn't that a bit of an exaggeration?

211
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:29,198
It's not an exaggeration

212
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:29,198
Everyone was worried.

213
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:32,165
Yes, yes...

214
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:35,000
But speaking of origin, it's about it.

215
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
what?

216
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Not anything.

217
00:15:43,792 --> 00:15:48,297
With mom and dad

218
00:15:43,792 --> 00:15:48,297
Isn't there something to talk about?

219
00:15:56,297 --> 00:15:58,297
Well then.

220
00:16:09,792 --> 00:16:13,858
I wonder if Asahi will live a lifetime

221
00:16:09,792 --> 00:16:13,858
Because I was thinking it ➡

222
00:16:13,858 --> 00:16:16,726
Honestly, I was surprised.

223
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:20,066
I'm a little surprised myself too.

224
00:16:22,099 --> 00:16:24,297
Wait a moment here.

225
00:16:24,297 --> 00:16:26,297
picture?

226
00:16:27,825 --> 00:16:29,396
(Saori) Yes.

227
00:16:29,396 --> 00:16:32,825
What... is this...

228
00:16:35,693 --> 00:16:39,132
(Saori) After Asahi left

229
00:16:35,693 --> 00:16:39,132
I stamped it right away.

230
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:46,000
But when it comes to it

231
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:46,000
I'm afraid I'll cut off Asahi ➡

232
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,330
I couldn't put it out.

233
00:16:52,627 --> 00:16:55,924
Well, because you're not divorced ➡

234
00:16:55,924 --> 00:16:59,396
It's not that it's connected

235
00:16:55,924 --> 00:16:59,396
There wasn't.

236
00:16:59,396 --> 00:17:02,231
It had been cut long ago.

240
00:17:33,396 --> 00:17:38,429
I filed a divorce yesterday.

241
00:17:38,429 --> 00:17:40,429
I see.

242
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:52,363
Recently, marriage and divorce

243
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:52,363
What about the company?

244
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:55,363
In my head

245
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:55,363
It was a mess, but...

246
00:18:00,132 --> 00:18:06,330
Me... with this child

247
00:18:00,132 --> 00:18:06,330
I want to live.

248
00:18:09,924 --> 00:18:13,660
The rest is vague ➡

249
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:18,363
That's all

250
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:18,363
It's clear.

251
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:24,198
So now it's just

252
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:24,198
I cherish that feeling.

255
00:18:32,231 --> 00:18:36,231
What to do to a child without a father?

256
00:18:36,231 --> 00:18:40,561
It's my selfishness

257
00:18:36,231 --> 00:18:40,561
I know.

258
00:18:40,561 --> 00:18:43,759
Raising a child alone is

259
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:48,594
It can be very difficult

260
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:48,594
I know.

261
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:51,825
but….

262
00:18:51,825 --> 00:18:59,891
Even if you don't have a father

263
00:18:51,825 --> 00:18:59,891
I'll make this child happy.

264
00:18:59,891 --> 00:19:02,066
absolutely.

265
00:19:04,957 --> 00:19:06,957
Yeah.

266
00:19:10,165 --> 00:19:12,957
It might be obvious but ➡

267
00:19:12,957 --> 00:19:19,066
Other than me, my life

268
00:19:12,957 --> 00:19:19,066
I don't think I can live.

269
00:19:19,066 --> 00:19:25,495
I realized that

270
00:19:19,066 --> 00:19:25,495
Because I met Yamate.

272
00:19:28,231 --> 00:19:33,693
Because Yamate-san

273
00:19:28,231 --> 00:19:33,693
He taught me.

274
00:19:33,693 --> 00:19:38,363

I also have one report.

279
00:19:56,198 --> 00:19:59,759
I decided to change jobs.

280

That's...➡

281
00:20:04,561 --> 00:20:09,297
We are in the same company

282
00:20:04,561 --> 00:20:09,297
Because I can't stay

Right, right?

284
00:20:12,528 --> 00:20:15,660
I'm the ace of the sales department, right?

285
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:19,561
From other companies in the same industry

286
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:19,561
There are a lot of hands to pull.

287
00:20:19,561 --> 00:20:24,396
I also decided by Yamate-san.

288
00:20:19,561 --> 00:20:24,396
I respect it.
