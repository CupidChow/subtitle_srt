(Tomata Maki)

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
thank you very much.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,891
When you're being entangled with the manager

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,891
You helped me... right?

6
00:00:10,891 --> 00:00:13,330
(Yamate) Do that for anyone

7
00:00:10,891 --> 00:00:13,330
Are you tired when you're in tune?

8
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,825
If there's something you want to say

9
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,825
I wish I could say it clearly.

10
00:00:15,825 --> 00:00:19,066
(Sekiguchi)

11
00:00:15,825 --> 00:00:19,066
Yamate-kun

12
00:00:15,825 --> 00:00:19,066
Apparently he's a pretty playboy.

13
00:00:19,066 --> 00:00:22,330
Maki-chan should be careful too.

14
00:00:19,066 --> 00:00:22,330
It's absolutely impossible.

15
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:26,165
(Send Island)

16
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:26,165
Maki-chan and her kids

17
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:26,165
Have you not thought about it? ➡

18
00:00:26,165 --> 00:00:28,165
Because he's insensitive ➡

19
00:00:28,165 --> 00:00:31,330
I have to say that I want it

20
00:00:28,165 --> 00:00:31,330
It won't convey it?

21
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:33,825
My husband works as a high school teacher.

22
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:37,231
What if you stop being that "master"?

23
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:37,231
picture?

24
00:00:37,231 --> 00:00:41,660
Because Tomata-san

25
00:00:37,231 --> 00:00:41,660
Isn't it the main character of Tomata-san's life?

26
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,660
What is this...?

27
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:47,000
There's no point. just

28
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:47,000
I just did it because I wanted to kiss her.

29
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:05,165
(Eleveter arrival sound)

30
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:22,495
Oh Tomata-san. Good morning.

31
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:30,330
good morning.

32
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:34,825
picture? No no, that

33
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:34,825
You don't have to avoid it openly.

34
00:01:37,495 --> 00:01:41,000
Oh maybe

35
00:01:37,495 --> 00:01:41,000
Are you aware of me?

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Of course, if that's what happened

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Even if you don't like it, you'll be aware of it!

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
What is that?

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Brought up in Brazil

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
For Yamate-san ➡

41
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,825
Maybe it's just a greeting

42
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,825
I don't think so, but...

43
00:01:55,825 --> 00:01:59,000
ah. A kiss is a kiss.

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,660
The environment in which I grew up

45
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,660
I don't think it matters though.

46
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:07,495
yeah…?

47
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:07,495
Tomata thinks too much in his mind.

48
00:02:07,495 --> 00:02:10,330
Why not live your life as your heart goes?

49
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,495
Even if I say that...

50
00:02:12,495 --> 00:02:15,660
(Eleveter arrival sound)

51
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,825
Whether it's a greeting or not

52
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,825
Is that important?

53
00:02:19,825 --> 00:02:23,264
It's important isn't it...

(Tomata Kyoichi) Wow!

58
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:13,000
Please give up now.

59
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:13,000
(Kenta) No no.

60
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:13,000
Next time, play dinosaurs.

61
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,165
Dinosaur play?

62
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,165
Yeah.

63
00:03:15,165 --> 00:03:20,330
(Moe)Here you Kenta.

64
00:03:15,165 --> 00:03:20,330
Uncle Kyoichi said he was tired.

65
00:03:15,165 --> 00:03:20,330
(Kenta) Eh.

66
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:23,330
Moe It's not an old man

67
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:23,330
You're your big brother.

68
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:26,330
From Kenta's perspective

69
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:26,330
You're literally an old man, right?

70
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:29,825
Big brother looks young

71
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:29,825
I'm over 30 already.

72
00:03:29,825 --> 00:03:32,396
You're your big brother, right?

73
00:03:29,825 --> 00:03:32,396
Yeah.

74
00:03:32,396 --> 00:03:35,660
If you like this, please.

75
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:38,660
Ah, thank you very much.

76
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:46,495
Ah...maybe

77
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:46,495
Strawberry Daifuku was not good at it?

78
00:03:46,495 --> 00:03:49,825
Mom hates bean paste.

79
00:03:49,825 --> 00:03:53,165
Ah... sorry, actually...

80
00:03:53,165 --> 00:03:58,660
No, I don't know

81
00:03:53,165 --> 00:03:58,660
Sorry.

82
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,660
Today, my father-in-law

83
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,660
Was it inconvenient?

84
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:06,132
(Tomata Yasuko)

85
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:06,132
Ah... I'm a little sick

86
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:06,132
I'm sleeping at home.

87
00:04:06,132 --> 00:04:10,099
Anticancer drug treatment since last month

88
00:04:06,132 --> 00:04:10,099
I've started though ➡

89
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:14,000
More than I thought

90
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:14,000
It seems like it's tough...

91
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,660
I see.

92
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,825
Until recently

93
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,825
Ken-chan can ride his shoulders ➡

94
00:04:19,825 --> 00:04:23,000
He was fine, but...

95
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,495
Kenta After being born

96
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,495
"My first grandson!" ➡

97
00:04:25,495 --> 00:04:27,660
Dad what?

98
00:04:25,495 --> 00:04:27,660
You're a little younger, right?

99
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,792
Hehe...

100
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,792
Hehehe.

101
00:04:30,792 --> 00:04:33,330
My eyes are on fire... Look.

102
00:04:30,792 --> 00:04:33,330
yeah?

103
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,330
That something to me

104
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,330
If possible ➡

105
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:43,495
Say anything.

106
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:43,495
It's okay.

107
00:04:43,495 --> 00:04:47,330
It's Maki-chan too

108
00:04:43,495 --> 00:04:47,330
Both of us are busy working.

109
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:50,330
There's Moe too, isn't it?

110
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:50,330
(Moe) Yes.

111
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,660
(Yasuko) It's okay. It's okay.

112
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:02,165
I wish I could tell you.

113
00:05:02,165 --> 00:05:05,000
What?

114
00:05:07,495 --> 00:05:11,330
Ah,

115
00:05:07,495 --> 00:05:11,330
Do you hate bean paste?

116
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:15,660
It's not true, about your father-in-law...

117
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,033
He's currently undergoing chemotherapy treatment.

118
00:05:19,033 --> 00:05:24,297
Ah... I'm worried about Maki too much

119
00:05:19,033 --> 00:05:24,297
I didn't want to go.

120
00:05:24,297 --> 00:05:32,000
It's just an extra... family

121
00:05:24,297 --> 00:05:32,000
Of course you need to worry...

122
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
(Sigh)

123
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Kenta-kun. It's been a while since I played with Kyoichi

124
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It looked like a lot of fun.

125
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
yes?

126
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Yeah. I'm so excited

127
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Kenta-kun was the first time I've seen it.

128
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,330
I see. That's good.

129
00:06:09,165 --> 00:06:16,330
Hey... Does Kyoichi want children?

130
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,660
I want it. Children...

131
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,660
What does Kyoichi think?

132
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,660
I know...

133
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,660
Let's talk slowly next time.

134
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,495
When will it be next?

135
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:48,165
(Sigh)

136
00:06:48,165 --> 00:06:52,000
sorry.

137
00:06:55,495 --> 00:06:57,495
(The sound of the door closing)

138
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:03,165
foolish thoughtless ignorant➡

139
00:07:03,165 --> 00:07:06,165
Stupid, shallow, ignorant, etc.➡

140
00:07:06,165 --> 00:07:08,297
The word that means

141
00:07:06,165 --> 00:07:08,297
There are many, so ➡

142
00:07:08,297 --> 00:07:11,495
To remember all together

143
00:07:08,297 --> 00:07:11,495
It's useful for exams too.

144
00:07:11,495 --> 00:07:15,000
Also, this means that

145
00:07:11,495 --> 00:07:15,000
Stay hungry stay foolish.

146
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
(chime)

147
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Ah, Nakajima-san.

148
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
What's up?

149
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,660
(Rina)ignorant spelling

150
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,660
I was wrong.

151
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,495
picture?

152
00:07:35,495 --> 00:07:40,495
A was turned into e.

153
00:07:40,495 --> 00:07:46,000
Ah...Is that so...

154
00:07:40,495 --> 00:07:46,000
That's embarrassing.

155
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Hehe... sorry.

156
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,330
Ah no...my lesson ➡

157
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:57,165
Someone who listens seriously

158
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:57,165
I thought there was.

159
00:07:57,165 --> 00:08:02,330
I'm listening.

160
00:07:57,165 --> 00:08:02,330
The teacher's lesson is pretty interesting.

161
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:05,000
That may have been the first time I've heard it.

162
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,825
But Professor Tomata is somehow...

163
00:08:09,825 --> 00:08:12,165
After all, it's nothing.

164
00:08:12,165 --> 00:08:14,165
What... what?

165
00:08:14,165 --> 00:08:18,330
Hehe...

166
00:08:14,165 --> 00:08:18,330
I always feel like my soul is missing ➡

167
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:23,165
It's kind of like a fluttering

168
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:23,165
It looks like a ghost. ➡

169
00:08:23,165 --> 00:08:26,000
Hehehe...

170
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,660
Hey Nakajima, right?

171
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,660
Delete the blackboard!

172
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,825
a~.

173
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,825
So what about the teacher's spelling mistake?

174
00:08:33,825 --> 00:08:37,495
That I wasn't there

175
00:08:33,825 --> 00:08:37,495
I'll do that. well!

176
00:08:42,165 --> 00:08:44,330
ignorant.

177
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:49,825
(Natsumi)

178
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:49,825
This tea set is lovely.

179
00:08:49,825 --> 00:08:54,330
My husband was on a business trip to the UK the other day.

180
00:08:49,825 --> 00:08:54,330
They bought it as a souvenir.

181
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:58,825
Oh, it's amazing!

182
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:58,825
A good husband.

183
00:09:00,825 --> 00:09:03,495
(Natsumi) Oh, and then let's get to the main topic.

184
00:09:03,495 --> 00:09:07,495
Breast augmentation surgery is real now

185
00:09:03,495 --> 00:09:07,495
There are many different ways though.

186
00:09:07,495 --> 00:09:10,330
What I recommend is ➡

187
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:15,000
From the sucked fat in the butt and belly

188
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:15,000
Culture the stem cells ➡

189
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,495
It's injected into the chest

190
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,495
It's the latest method though.

191
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,495
Wow...

192
00:09:19,495 --> 00:09:22,825
Put in the silicone bag

193
00:09:19,495 --> 00:09:22,825
There's a way to do it ➡

194
00:09:22,825 --> 00:09:26,924
To insert an artificial one

195
00:09:22,825 --> 00:09:26,924
Many people are reluctant, right?

196
00:09:26,924 --> 00:09:30,396
Well, that's a bit

197
00:09:26,924 --> 00:09:30,396
It's going to get expensive though.

198
00:09:30,396 --> 00:09:33,825
There is no limit to the budget

199
00:09:30,396 --> 00:09:33,825
Please tell me more info.

200
00:09:33,825 --> 00:09:36,000
I'm interested.

201
00:09:33,825 --> 00:09:36,000
Oh, then next time ➡

202
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,825
Come to our clinic.

203
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,825
I'll make a reservation.

204

Recently, extremely excellent medical hyphen

208
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,495
I've become able to do it.

209
00:09:51,495 --> 00:09:53,660
(Yorishima) What is it like?

210
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,825
The requested presentation material

211
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,825
I've put it all together.

212
00:10:14,825 --> 00:10:17,660
(Sudou) What?! Have you managed it already?

213
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:21,825
As expected of Tomata-san.

214
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:21,825
Ah, no...

215
00:10:21,825 --> 00:10:25,660
Everyone in the sales department really

216
00:10:21,825 --> 00:10:25,660
I'm relying on Tomata-san.

217
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:29,066
Oh... Yamate, who is strict about his work, is also a stern person.

218
00:10:29,066 --> 00:10:31,396
Tomata's work

219
00:10:29,066 --> 00:10:31,396
I was impressed.

220
00:10:31,396 --> 00:10:33,396
Huh?

221
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:39,660
No way...

222
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:39,660
No, it's true.

223
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,165
There are places that no one notices

224
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,165
Don't miss it ➡

225
00:10:42,165 --> 00:10:45,825
Because I'll check it out

226
00:10:42,165 --> 00:10:45,825
It's really reliable.

228
00:10:45,825 --> 00:10:48,660
There are customers.

229
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:53,000
Ah yes.

230
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:53,000

Have you fallen in love with it?

235
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:27,330
Yes, uterine romance.

00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:33,660
Not the head

237
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:33,660
To fall in love here.

238
00:11:38,495 --> 00:11:41,660
Uterine love.

239

Maki-chan. About that person

240
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:48,000
Are you worried?

241
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,495
What?!? That's what

242
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,495
It's absolutely impossible!

243
00:11:51,495 --> 00:11:56,825
It's not delicate, it's really rude

244
00:11:51,495 --> 00:11:56,825
He's quite a playboy.

245
00:11:56,825 --> 00:11:59,825
It's a desperate deny

246
00:11:56,825 --> 00:11:59,825
It's already more and more suspicious.

247
00:11:59,825 --> 00:12:04,495
Ah, maybe

248
00:11:59,825 --> 00:12:04,495
Something has already happened.

Oh no, that's why

252
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:18,660
That's not the case.

253
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:23,000
I mean

254
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:23,000
I have Kyoichi...

255
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,495
I see. I see.

256
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:29,000
Well, that's right.

257
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
yes.

258
00:12:38,165 --> 00:12:40,495
Ah, welcome back.

259
00:12:40,495 --> 00:12:46,000
I learned it at cooking class tonight

260
00:12:40,495 --> 00:12:46,000
I tried cabbage rolls.

261
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,660
ah….

262
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:53,000
Sorry I have a bit of an appetite.

00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:57,660
Are you busy at school?

274
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:02,000
Well... the new semester

275
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:02,000
There's a lot to do.

276
00:14:07,165 --> 00:14:10,330
That's difficult.

277
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:14,495
So you should go to bed early.

278
00:14:37,825 --> 00:14:44,660
Maki Do you feel like you want to do it today?

279
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:48,000
Ah...no...

280
00:14:51,495 --> 00:14:59,000
Hey. Why is Maki?

281
00:14:51,495 --> 00:14:59,000
Do you want children?

282
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,330
Why...

283
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:08,330
Even if you don't have children

284
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:08,330
There are many happy couples.

285
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
That's right, but...

286
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,495
Having a child

287
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,495
I don't think it's all good.

288
00:15:26,495 --> 00:15:32,495
Our time will be reduced

289
00:15:26,495 --> 00:15:32,495
The financial burden will also increase...

290
00:15:37,825 --> 00:15:42,495
That might be true though.

291
00:15:42,495 --> 00:15:44,660
But?

292
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,330
If you have kids...➡

293
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:57,561
With Kyoichi...

294
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:57,561
I feel like I can become more family.

295
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,627
So now

296
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,627
Does that mean it's not family?

297
00:16:05,627 --> 00:16:10,561
Oh, it's not

298
00:16:05,627 --> 00:16:10,561
It's not that way...

299
00:16:10,561 --> 00:16:12,693
sorry.

300
00:16:12,693 --> 00:16:16,363
Haa... I'm that much

301
00:16:12,693 --> 00:16:16,363
Can't you trust it?

302
00:16:16,363 --> 00:16:19,264
That's not the case!

303
00:16:19,264 --> 00:16:22,792
I'll go to bed soon tomorrow.

304
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:30,528
good night.

305
00:16:46,957 --> 00:16:48,462

(Koike) Yes.

307
00:16:48,462 --> 00:16:50,660
(Miyazaki) I ordered this morning

308
00:16:48,462 --> 00:16:50,660
Have you got an additional order form?

309
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,363
(Koike)

310
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,363
Ah, sorry I'm doing it now!

311
00:16:52,363 --> 00:16:54,627
Sorry, please hurry.

312
00:16:52,363 --> 00:16:54,627
yes!

313
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,264
Koike-san... are you okay?

314
00:17:04,264 --> 00:17:07,957
Yes, it's fine.

315
00:17:07,957 --> 00:17:11,792
Are you feeling unwell?

316
00:17:11,792 --> 00:17:16,132
It's not a big deal so...

317
00:17:11,792 --> 00:17:16,132
it's okay.

318
00:17:16,132 --> 00:17:18,891
I see...

319
00:17:18,891 --> 00:17:22,957
But if it's difficult

320
00:17:18,891 --> 00:17:22,957
Please round it up as early as possible.

321
00:17:22,957 --> 00:17:25,462
yes.

322
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:29,330

If you want to organize your receipts

327
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:41,891
I'll do it later... right?

328
00:17:47,825 --> 00:17:50,594

I'm really sorry.

332
00:17:52,429 --> 00:17:57,033
I'll buy it.

That's fine.

Yamate-san

380
00:20:39,726 --> 00:20:43,594
I don't really understand.

381
00:20:39,726 --> 00:20:43,594
Hmm...

382
00:20:43,594 --> 00:20:46,825
Something as simple as me

383
00:20:43,594 --> 00:20:46,825
I don't think there's one there.

384
00:20:46,825 --> 00:20:48,825
a.

385
00:20:52,033 --> 00:20:55,000
About me

386
00:20:52,033 --> 00:20:55,000
Do you want to know more?

387
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,429
Tomata-san

388
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,429
It's really roundabout, isn't it?

389
00:21:00,858 --> 00:21:04,495
Really already

390
00:21:00,858 --> 00:21:04,495
Please stop teasing.

391
00:21:09,495 --> 00:21:13,825
sorry

392
00:21:09,495 --> 00:21:13,825
Tomata-san: You may be misunderstood.

393
00:21:13,825 --> 00:21:17,066
Me with Tomata

394
00:21:13,825 --> 00:21:17,066
Because I don't want to fall in love.

395
00:21:19,627 --> 00:21:23,561
I'm Yamate too

396
00:21:19,627 --> 00:21:23,561
I don't want to fall in love.

397
00:21:23,561 --> 00:21:26,957
I mean, I'm married!

398
00:21:26,957 --> 00:21:30,363
Ha...! Date and itemized

00:21:26,957 --> 00:21:30,363

Well, do your best.

Kyoichi always has oolong tea.

Yorishima is always a little late.
