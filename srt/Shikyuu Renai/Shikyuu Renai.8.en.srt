192
00:14:25,595 --> 00:14:29,100
Hey, it's sparkling.

193
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:34,199
Ah, it's big...

194
00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:37,430
There are also small ones.

195
00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:37,430
That's true.

196
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:40,199
cute.

197
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:45,100
The conger eel was cute.

198
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:45,100
Hey, that was cute.

200
00:14:54,265 --> 00:14:59,100
a~. Something like this ➡

201
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:04,265
I took in the air with all my might

202
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:04,265
It might have been a while...

203
00:15:04,265 --> 00:15:07,100
Have you had a good change of mood?

204
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,199
yes.

205
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,364
Come to think of it, isn't it your first time?

206
00:15:12,364 --> 00:15:15,760
yeah?

207
00:15:12,364 --> 00:15:15,760
Date.

208
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,265
Right.

209
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:27,100
Ah, it smells nice.

210
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,892
Ah, it's a kebab.

211
00:15:31,892 --> 00:15:33,925
I'm hungry, shall we go?

212
00:15:33,925 --> 00:15:37,430
That's good, huh...

213
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:40,430
You can also add toppings.

214
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:40,430
Looks tasty.

215
00:15:47,595 --> 00:15:50,100
Yeah!

216
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,265
Hehe!

217
00:15:53,265 --> 00:15:56,595
Speaking of Brazilian cuisine

218
00:15:53,265 --> 00:15:56,595
It's a churrasco though ➡

219
00:15:56,595 --> 00:16:00,430
Kebabs look a bit similar

220
00:15:56,595 --> 00:16:00,430
It's kind of nostalgic.

221
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:02,760
What's the difference?

222
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,760
Big meat skewed and grilled

223
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,760
That's the same thing though ➡

224
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:11,595
The types of meat and seasoning are completely different.

225
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:11,595
Wow.

226
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:15,265
Next time Brazilian food

227
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:15,265
Let's go out to eat together.

228
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:17,760
i wanna go! Hehehe...

229
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:24,595
Me forever...➡

230
00:16:24,595 --> 00:16:28,265
Where to walk and what to eat ➡

231
00:16:28,265 --> 00:16:31,925
Always the same thing

232
00:16:28,265 --> 00:16:31,925
I think it was repeated.

233
00:16:34,595 --> 00:16:37,100
Yamate always

234
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:41,430
Something new for me

235
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:41,430
It will show you.

236
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:44,100
Hehe.

237
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:47,430
Hey, Tomata-san.

238
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:49,430
yes.

239
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:52,100
It's too late now though ➡

240
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:56,430
It's hard to call Tomata-san ➡

241
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:59,760
Can I call you Maki?

242
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:59,760
picture?

243
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:05,100
Ah... at work

244
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:05,100
It's okay because you won't call.

245
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,760
yes.

247
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,100

Hehehe...

249
00:17:28,595 --> 00:17:31,760
Ah...Yamate-san ➡

250
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,925
You'll be seen.

252
00:17:54,595 --> 00:17:56,760
It tastes like kebabs.

253
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:01,265
Huh, a moment...!

254
00:18:01,265 --> 00:18:04,100
Sorry, sorry.

255
00:18:01,265 --> 00:18:04,100
No way.

256
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,830
Hey, Tomata-san.

257
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,830
yes.

258
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:20,595
It's this project

259
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:20,595
Can you help me a little?

260
00:18:25,265 --> 00:18:27,265
nursery school?

261
00:18:27,265 --> 00:18:30,925
yes. 46 years old

262
00:18:27,265 --> 00:18:30,925
It's an old nursery though.

263
00:18:30,925 --> 00:18:34,265
First, in my renovation department

264
00:18:30,925 --> 00:18:34,265
The conversation has come.

265
00:18:34,265 --> 00:18:37,760
But the leak is also terrible

266
00:18:34,265 --> 00:18:37,760
I can't even reinforce the earthquake resistant ➡

267
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:42,265
So you should rebuild it

268
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:42,265
I went to my department.

269
00:18:42,265 --> 00:18:45,265
Wow...

270
00:18:45,265 --> 00:18:47,430
But why to me?

271
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:51,430
Only from Tomata's perspective

272
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:51,430
I feel like there's something I can't see.

273
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:56,265
((Really, to a nursery school teacher

274
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:56,265

275
00:18:56,265 --> 00:19:01,265

279
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,265

281
00:19:16,595 --> 00:19:20,265
I think other work is busy too

282
00:19:16,595 --> 00:19:20,265
Please consider it.

283
00:19:20,265 --> 00:19:22,265

Haha, that's good. So ➡
