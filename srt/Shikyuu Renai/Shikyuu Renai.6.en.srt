It was my first time.

I see...it's my second time.

112
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:54,100
The first time is when we part ways.

113
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:59,430
I'm one-sided

When I was in my first year of university

We were dating. ➡

Maki didn't know about it. ➡

118
00:09:07,925 --> 00:09:13,430
Hmm, no one in the circle

119
00:09:07,925 --> 00:09:13,430
Maybe you didn't know? ➡

120
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:16,760
We had a short time together.

121
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,430
Because I hadn't told anyone.

Excuse me.

But even after we parted ways ➡

124
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,760
Only physical relationships

125
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,760

Somewhere in my heart ➡

130
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:57,100
I think so

131
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:57,100
I felt that way.

132
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,760
Rather than being surprised, it's rather ➡

133

"I see, that's right."

134
00:10:07,595 --> 00:10:12,925

I've never seen it before

136
00:10:12,925 --> 00:10:16,430
Maybe he was doing it.

137
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:34,628
I'm going to say something like this to Maki-chan

00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:28,100
A senior at a university I admired ➡

194
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:36,595
A relationship between a man and a woman with her husband

195
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:36,595
I knew that was...

196
00:14:36,595 --> 00:14:43,760
That's... so shocking.

197
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:53,100
But more than I thought

198
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:53,100
I don't get angry.

199
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:57,057
Even myself

200
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:57,057
I don't really understand though.

201
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:06,562
In my own way, somehow

202
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:06,562
Sometimes I know...

203
00:15:10,529 --> 00:15:19,430
That's more than my husband

204
00:15:10,529 --> 00:15:19,430
That you like that person.

205
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:29,100
And that person is better than me

206
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:29,100
That I like my husband.

207
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,760
Tomata-san, what do you want to do?

208
00:15:46,595 --> 00:15:51,430
In the future with those two

209
00:15:46,595 --> 00:15:51,430
What kind of relationship do you want to have?

210
00:15:57,595 --> 00:16:01,100
I have no choice, right?

211
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:09,859
I agree.

212
00:16:09,859 --> 00:16:18,100
♬〜

213
00:16:22,855 --> 00:16:27,165
Welcome home.

214
00:16:22,855 --> 00:16:27,165
I'm home.

215
00:16:27,165 --> 00:16:29,330
What's dinner today?

216
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:34,066
Sorry I didn't have time so I couldn't make it.

217
00:16:34,066 --> 00:16:37,000
Seriously...

218
00:16:34,066 --> 00:16:37,000
Kyoichi.

219
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,495
yeah?

220
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,495
Jacket ➡

221
00:16:40,495 --> 00:16:44,000
On a hanger rack

222
00:16:40,495 --> 00:16:44,000
Can't you send me?

223
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,330
yes?

224
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,330
I'm always on a chair

225
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,330
Kyoichi's top jacket ➡

226
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:52,330
I use a hanger rack every day

227
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:52,330
I'm putting it on.

228
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:55,132
Did you notice?

229
00:16:55,132 --> 00:16:58,330
Hmm...

230
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:03,825
Such a small thing

231
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:03,825
It doesn't matter...it's a hassle.

232
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:11,165
What is that?

233
00:17:11,165 --> 00:17:14,330
Because I've stamped it.

234
00:17:19,495 --> 00:17:23,000
teeth? What are you talking about?

235
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:28,660
picture? A bit what? suddenly.

236
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:34,825
It's not sudden...

237
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:34,825
It was long since finished.

238
00:17:34,825 --> 00:17:38,330
Hmm... I don't understand the meaning though.

239
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:41,330
My dad is dead

240
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:41,330
I'm already in a hurry ➡

241
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:43,660
Please spare me.

242
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:53,000
There's someone I like.

243
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:53,000
So I want you to break up.

244
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
teeth!?

245
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,660
Please part ways.

246
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:05,165
I don't want it.

247
00:18:05,165 --> 00:18:09,165
I'm not saying it's right away.

248
00:18:09,165 --> 00:18:12,000
I don't want it.

249
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:20,000
No no!

250
00:18:23,825 --> 00:18:26,330
Wait a minute!

251
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,495
It hurts... stop...

252
00:18:38,495 --> 00:18:42,000
This is what always happens

253
00:18:38,495 --> 00:18:42,000
I wish I had done it...

254
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,330
What are you talking about?

255
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:46,660
Because I won't do it at all ➡

256
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:50,165
Someone who might do it

257
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:50,165
Did you find it?

258
00:18:50,165 --> 00:18:52,495
Just do it casually...

259
00:18:52,495 --> 00:18:56,165
If you want to do that

260
00:18:52,495 --> 00:18:56,165
I'll do it.

261
00:18:59,495 --> 00:19:01,495
Stop it!!

Kyoichi is

If you say you're divorced

282
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:33,165
