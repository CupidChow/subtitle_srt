2
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,759
Maki-chan and her kids

3
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,759
Have you not thought about it?

4
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:09,557
(Yamate)

5
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:09,557
Tomata-san

6
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:09,557
Isn't it the main character of Tomata-san's life?

7
00:00:09,557 --> 00:00:11,057
(Maki Tomata) This is it.

8
00:00:11,057 --> 00:00:13,991
There's no point. just

9
00:00:11,057 --> 00:00:13,991
I just did it because I wanted to kiss her.

10
00:00:13,991 --> 00:00:17,628
(Send Island)

11
00:00:13,991 --> 00:00:17,628
That's the uterus

12
00:00:13,991 --> 00:00:17,628
Have you fallen in love with it? ➡

13
00:00:17,628 --> 00:00:19,430
Uterine love.

14
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:22,331
I have Kyoichi...

15
00:00:22,331 --> 00:00:24,199
I want it. Children...

16
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:26,529
(Tomata Kyoichi)

17
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:26,529
Do you feel like you want to do it today?

18
00:00:26,529 --> 00:00:29,430
Why does Maki want children?

19
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:37,232
If I had kids, I would say Kyoichi...

20
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:37,232
I feel like I can become more family.

21
00:00:37,232 --> 00:00:39,859
So now

22
00:00:37,232 --> 00:00:39,859
Does that mean it's not family?

23
00:00:39,859 --> 00:00:42,100
Tomata thinks too much in his mind.

24
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,232
Why not live your life as your heart goes?

25
00:00:44,232 --> 00:00:46,562
About me

26
00:00:44,232 --> 00:00:46,562
Do you want to know more?

27
00:00:46,562 --> 00:00:49,826
With Tomata

28
00:00:46,562 --> 00:00:49,826
Because I don't want to fall in love.

29
00:00:49,826 --> 00:00:53,232
I'm Yamate too

30
00:00:49,826 --> 00:00:53,232
I don't want to fall in love.

I don't know.

120
00:06:16,826 --> 00:06:19,166
Are there any tips or tricks?

121
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:22,133
A trick...

122
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:22,133

Is that so?

127
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:34,859
You like children.

128
00:06:34,859 --> 00:06:37,859

Yamate-kun, the child is being treated

192
00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:18,900
It was tasty, isn't it? ➡

193
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,900
As expected, it's different for those with children.

194
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:26,560
Because I don't have a ring

195
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:26,560
I thought I was just single.

196
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,296
picture? Yamate-kun

197
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,296
I think I was single though.

198
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:34,560
I got divorced quite a while ago

199
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:34,560
Your wife has custody

200
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,065
I asked someone though.

201
00:10:37,065 --> 00:10:39,065
Wow.

202
00:10:39,065 --> 00:10:41,230
a. Are you relieved now?

203
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:43,230
I haven't done it

204
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:43,230
What are you talking about?

205
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:45,230
I'm married in the first place.

206
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:48,900
Ahhh

207
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:48,900
Sorry, sorry... Of course.

208
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:55,725
Miyazaki and others just now ➡

209
00:10:55,725 --> 00:11:01,065
"If you have children, you can take parental leave

210
00:10:55,725 --> 00:11:01,065
I'm jealous that you can also choose to save time. ➡

211
00:11:01,065 --> 00:11:02,900
Quickly on that side

212
00:11:01,065 --> 00:11:02,900
I want to go"

213
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:06,900
I heard you were talking.

214
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,725
I'm about my age and single ➡

215
00:11:09,725 --> 00:11:13,900
See, I'm going to take maternity leave already

216
00:11:09,725 --> 00:11:13,900
Because it's impossible...➡

217
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:18,230
Honestly, I'm a bit envious of you.

218
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:22,395
Ah, but that's why

219
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:22,395
One person forever ➡

220
00:11:22,395 --> 00:11:24,395
It's not that I've decided.

221
00:11:24,395 --> 00:11:29,900
No but

222
00:11:24,395 --> 00:11:29,900
It's not that one person is disgusting...

223
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:34,230
Sorry I can't see the story...

224
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:34,230
Ah, no...

225
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:37,900
But married people

226
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:37,900
Don't fall in love for sure ➡

227
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,395
Single people try hard to fall in love ➡

228
00:11:40,395 --> 00:11:46,230
I have to find a partner

229
00:11:40,395 --> 00:11:46,230
I wonder if it's not good.

230
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:50,560
Sorry I'm totally

231
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:50,560
It's just twisted.

232
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,725
Ah no...

233
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,725
Sorry, what I said earlier was ➡

234
00:11:53,725 --> 00:11:55,900
It's not that way...

235
00:11:53,725 --> 00:11:55,900
Yes. ➡

236
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:59,065
Because if you think about it normally in your head

237
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:59,065
It's not good after all ➡

238
00:11:59,065 --> 00:12:03,900
A married person falls in love with someone other than her husband.

239
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,900
Let's finish it soon.

240
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:14,900
(Telephone Bell)

241
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,560
I don't organize it enough ➡

242
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:32,395
I have ordered it.

243
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:32,395
Ah...thank you.

244
00:12:32,395 --> 00:12:36,230

245
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:39,230
OK?

246
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:45,230
ah…

247
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:45,230
It's fine. Because it's because of that.

248
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:49,395
rain?

249
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:49,395
Yeah.

250
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:49,395
I'm weak to changes in atmospheric pressure.

251
00:12:49,395 --> 00:12:52,395
If it suddenly rains or something

252
00:12:49,395 --> 00:12:52,395
My head hurts.

253
00:12:56,395 --> 00:12:58,560

254
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,659
Oh no, for Yamate-san too

255
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,659
There are things I'm not good at.

256
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:06,230
What are you talking about? There are so many things.

257
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:10,395
I don't like peppers

258
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:10,395
I'm not good at reptiles either.

259
00:13:10,395 --> 00:13:12,560
I'm not good at Karai either.
