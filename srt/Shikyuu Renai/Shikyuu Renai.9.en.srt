00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,528
(Maki Tomata) There's someone I like.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,528
So I want you to break up.

4
00:00:07,528 --> 00:00:10,462
Just do it casually...

5
00:00:07,528 --> 00:00:10,462
(Tomata Kyoichi) I'll do it.

6
00:00:10,462 --> 00:00:13,561
Even though I don't like Yorishima-senpai!

7
00:00:13,561 --> 00:00:17,231
(Yamate) If it's okay at home, forever

8
00:00:13,561 --> 00:00:17,231
It's fine if you're there.

9
00:00:17,231 --> 00:00:19,231
I'll never divorce.

10
00:00:19,231 --> 00:00:21,033
Divorce is

11
00:00:19,231 --> 00:00:21,033
Because I won't do it.

12
00:00:21,033 --> 00:00:24,165
Kyoichi is a bit scary...

13
00:00:24,165 --> 00:00:27,825
it's okay. Because I'm with it.

14
00:00:27,825 --> 00:00:30,066
Yamate-san...

15
00:00:27,825 --> 00:00:30,066
yeah?

16
00:00:30,066 --> 00:00:31,759
Me...➡

17
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:33,792
I think I'm pregnant.

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,297
Unusually my period is late

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,297
I think it's weird ➡

20
00:00:44,297 --> 00:00:48,297
I tested it and it was positive.

21
00:00:52,363 --> 00:00:54,396
Get paid leave tomorrow ➡

22
00:00:54,396 --> 00:00:57,726
In the hospital properly

23
00:00:54,396 --> 00:00:57,726
I'm thinking of getting a doctor to check.

24
00:00:57,726 --> 00:01:01,924
I see.

25
00:00:57,726 --> 00:01:01,924
Sorry I can't go with you.

26
00:01:01,924 --> 00:01:03,924
home.

27
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:09,825
Congratulations ➡

28
00:01:09,825 --> 00:01:13,429
Is it too early to say that?

29
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:15,858
But we have to celebrate.

30
00:01:15,858 --> 00:01:18,099
Even delicious weekends

31
00:01:15,858 --> 00:01:18,099
Let's go and eat.

32
00:01:18,099 --> 00:01:20,099
Is there anything you want to eat?

33
00:01:23,462 --> 00:01:28,594
Still with Kyoichi

34
00:01:23,462 --> 00:01:28,594
Even though the divorce hasn't been completed.

35
00:01:28,594 --> 00:01:30,891
This is what happened...

36
00:01:35,792 --> 00:01:38,858
Maki is always

37
00:01:35,792 --> 00:01:38,858
Did you want a child?

38
00:01:38,858 --> 00:01:44,396
Because that's come true

39
00:01:38,858 --> 00:01:44,396
First off, isn't it "Congratulations"?

40
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:48,528
It's my first time, so I'm worried

41
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:48,528
I think there are a lot though ➡

42
00:01:48,528 --> 00:01:52,099
Let's solve the problem together.

43
00:01:52,099 --> 00:01:55,033
Oh, there are three of them.

(Obstetrician and Gynecologist) It's the fifth week. ➡

60
00:03:41,594 --> 00:03:44,363
When you reach the 6th week of pregnancy,

61
00:03:44,363 --> 00:03:48,264
Inside this gestational sac pouch

62
00:03:44,363 --> 00:03:48,264
It's called the embryo ➡

63
00:03:48,264 --> 00:03:51,627
The appearance of a small baby

64
00:03:48,264 --> 00:03:51,627
You'll see it. ➡

65
00:03:51,627 --> 00:03:56,264
Among them, the baby's heartbeat

66
00:03:51,627 --> 00:03:56,264
Once you can confirm it, you'll be relieved.

That being said

68
00:03:58,825 --> 00:04:01,693

I'm too worried

70
00:04:01,693 --> 00:04:06,099
Please do not do it. ➡

71

How was the hospital today?

83
00:05:32,363 --> 00:05:34,462
Are you okay?

84
00:05:50,429 --> 00:05:52,825
Yeah.

I don't know though.

Immediately after the hospital today

94
00:06:19,924 --> 00:06:25,792
I sent a message though.

95
00:06:25,792 --> 00:06:29,462
Ah, yes...

96
00:06:29,462 --> 00:06:33,627
Why

97
00:06:29,462 --> 00:06:33,627
Didn't you reply?

98
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:35,792
Sorry, I'm flapping.

99
00:06:39,726 --> 00:06:43,099
Yamate-san is carefree and nice.

101
00:06:43,099 --> 00:06:47,627
Nothing will change.

145
00:09:58,825 --> 00:10:05,330
A lot of people were crying, right?

146
00:09:58,825 --> 00:10:05,330
It's not proof that he was loved.

147
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:11,330
Get a wonderful wife

148
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:11,330

149
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:14,330

158
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:49,000
You don't think anything about it?

159

160
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:01,330
yeah?

161
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:07,330
I'm thinking of divorce Kyoichi.

162

teeth?

163
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:12,396
Now you can get divorced

164
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:12,396
I'm persuading it.

165
00:11:12,396 --> 00:11:16,000
Wait a moment.

166
00:11:12,396 --> 00:11:16,000
What's the sudden story?

167
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,330
Because it's important

168
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,330
Also for moms ➡

169
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:22,330
I thought maybe I should report it.

170
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:22,330
So what are you talking about?!

171
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,660
It's a harsh way to say it...

172
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,660
If you divorce Kyoichi ➡

173
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:34,660
Never again

174

175
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:39,000
No one is divorced after 30

176
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:39,000
Because they won't get it...

177
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,495

178
00:11:41,495 --> 00:11:43,000

180
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000

182
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,363
I don't like it.

183

184
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,594
Such a childish story

185
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,594
I'm not doing it!

186
00:11:56,594 --> 00:11:59,330
The values ​​of your mother

187
00:11:56,594 --> 00:11:59,330
Don't push it against me.

188
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:02,660
yes?

189
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:02,660
Mom is with dad

190
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:02,660
Because I didn't get divorced ➡

191
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:06,000
Did you become happy?

192

(Yorishima) Maki-chan?

203
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,693
Yorishima-senpai?

204
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,132
(Yorishima) It's been a while.

205
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:13,330
Here's where Maki-chan

206
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:13,330
I didn't think I would meet

207
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:16,660
I was surprised.

208
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:20,000
Me too...

209
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,330
Maybe Maki-chan...

210
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:35,000
Apparently it's already 6 weeks.

211
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Amazing... Congratulations.

212
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:46,000
I still haven't felt it at all...

213
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:52,330
I see.

214
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:59,660
Pregnancy... more

215
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:59,660
It's sparkly and exciting...➡

216
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:06,330
It's something that makes you feel happy

217
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:06,330
I was thinking about it...

218
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:08,396
But...

219
00:14:11,165 --> 00:14:15,330
I don't really understand...

220
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:20,330
That's what

221
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:20,330
If you hear what mom is saying ➡

222
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:25,330
Baby will make you sad?

223
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:34,000
And... at least I...

224
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:34,000
I'm so happy though.

225
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:45,660
When I talked to Kyoichi

226
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:45,660
I was wondering whether to talk...

227
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:50,825
I have a body that can't have babies.

229
00:14:50,825 --> 00:14:57,000
I don't have a uterus.

230
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
When I was a university student

231
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Endometrial cancer was found ➡

232
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Because I had a total hysterectomy.

233
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:13,660
(Send Island)

234
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:13,660
And I'm still on a regular basis now

235
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:13,660
I go to this gynecologist.

236
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,000

237
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:25,000

238
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:25,000
I didn't get all of it

239
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:25,000
You said that.

240
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,330
What I couldn't get...

241
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,330
baby.

242
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:38,000
Sorry... I don't know anything ➡

243

It's like your seniors are hurt

244
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,759
Say something insensitive...

245
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,660
Yes. No matter how you look at it ➡

246
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:48,165

247
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:48,165

This is...➡

249
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:59,495
Should I report it to Maki?

250
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:59,495
I don't know but...

251
00:15:59,495 --> 00:16:03,000
Who is Kyoichi?

252
00:15:59,495 --> 00:16:03,000
It's already finished.

253
00:16:06,825 --> 00:16:11,825
Impossible until the end

254
00:16:06,825 --> 00:16:11,825
Let me say it...➡

255
00:16:11,825 --> 00:16:15,825

00:16:11,825 --> 00:16:15,825
Of course it is ➡

257
00:16:15,825 --> 00:16:21,165
I'll be happy for Kyoichi too

258
00:16:15,825 --> 00:16:21,165
I want it to be.

259
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:29,330
I'm Kyoichi's life

260
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:29,330
Because I made it crazy.

261
00:16:33,165 --> 00:16:39,660
Ah...but Kyoichi

262

265
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:53,330
I didn't tell Kyoichi.

266
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:56,825
What? Why?

267
00:16:56,825 --> 00:17:00,495
