(Taken from the Body)

3
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,439
It's broad daylight,

4
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:22,879
why is it so dark here?

5
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:24,959
Why is it so cold?

6
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,519
It is a bit cold.

7
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:09,759
Pervert.

8
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:23,280
He's working.

9
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,240
He's up to no good.

10
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:53,599
(Which one is the meta-artefact?)

11
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,520
(Why does it feel)

12
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:12,960
(like it's still on her?)

13
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:51,360
You came.

14
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,360
You finally came.

15
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:55,520
I...

16
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,000
I knew you were a good person.

17
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,520
I knew you'd come to save me.

18
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:00,159
Save you?

19
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:02,080
I don't want to stay here anymore.

20
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,840
I don't want to be around that man.

21
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:05,479
He's terrifying.

22
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,639
That man?

23
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:07,840
Oh...

24
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,919
You mean that old man from earlier?

25
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,120
Isn't he your grandfather?

26
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:12,919
He's my husband.

27
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:14,599
What?

28
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,199
He forced me.

29
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,260
I don't want to serve someone
like that anymore.

30
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,279
Please.

31
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,460
Get me out of here.

32
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,399
I...

33
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:22,959
I...

34
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,480
I...

35
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,240
This is tricky.

36
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:27,279
I came

37
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:28,439
mainly to ask you,

38
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:29,560
do you have anything on you?

39
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,600
Something on me?

40
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,399
Stop messing around.

41
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,460
I have to stop him
from doing bad things.

42
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:39,240
What bad things?

43
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:41,680
Things bad for women.

44
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:44,360
Like what?

45
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,000
Like

46
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,160
intimate things, like a necklace.

47
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,199
Nope.

48
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,120
Under my clothes, there's nothing at all.

49
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,319
That's impossible.

50
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,450
If you don't believe me,

51
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:59,000
I can take my clothes off.

52
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:05,040
Hey.

53
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:09,839
Pervert.

54
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,639
Wait, I...

55
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:12,040
I was scared.

56
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:18,399
It's not what you think.

57
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,240
That's the kind of bad thing men do.

58
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,079
I'll protect him.

59
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,279
Who is he to you?

60
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:30,290
Why are you defending him?

61
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:33,480
He's my husband.

62
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,600
You pervert.

63
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,879
You creep.

64
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:44,759
Hey, calm down.

65
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:45,160
You brat!

66
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:50,279
(Oh.)

67
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:51,319
(Almost forgot.)

68
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:52,600
(Intent power works here.)

69
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,480
That's amazing.

70
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,959
Qi, help me.

71
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,040
Alright.

72
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,199
I'm exhausted.

73
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:32,920
So tired.

74
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,900
I'm dying of fatigue.

75
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:46,000
Who's that?

76
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:47,399
The one getting beaten up.

77
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:49,199
Luo En?

78
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm gonna go beat him up.

79
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,199
Hey!

80
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,680
Let's fight.

81
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,000
Sure.

82
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:58,480
Sigh.

83
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:00,680
What's taking them so long?

84
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,240
Something happened?

85
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,759
But Luo En can't beat Qi anyway.

86
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,319
(But they're still unconscious.)

87
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,639
(It's not safe.)

88
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:45,780
There's a thief!

89
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,039
Qi?

90
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,240
Qi?

91
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,240
Qi?

92
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,120
Qi?

93
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,879
Why are you just sitting here?

94
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,120
Hey.

95
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:38,480
Qi.

96
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:44,320
Luo En.

97
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:50,759
Everything from the past,

98
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:52,679
I remember it all clearly.

99
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:59,240
A little brat hitting that hard.

100
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:28,879
Darn it.

101
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,430
(I'm too far from the meta-artefact.)

102
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,120
Shut your mouth.

103
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:39,039
Luo En.

104
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,480
If you've got a problem, come at me.

105
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:00,000
Why did you kill my dad?

106
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:01,919
I didn't.

107
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:10,360
I'll ask you one last time.

108
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,000
Why did you kill my dad?

109
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,519
I

110
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,399
didn't

111
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:37,480
do it.
