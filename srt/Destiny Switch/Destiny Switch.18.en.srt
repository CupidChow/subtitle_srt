(Mr. Xu Huai's Last Wish)

3
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:04,920
Everyone.

4
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,990
The effects of the drug
are about to kick in.

5
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,519
The return train will be departing soon.

6
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,480
Please follow me
down the mountain immediately.

7
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,319
Once we're out of the mist,

8
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,079
everything will be fine.

9
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,959
The one who pulled the trigger

10
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:24,680
isn't necessarily the killer.

11
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:38,319
So it really was you.

12
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:40,400
You've finally arrived.

13
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,560
I had a best friend.

14
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,079
He died right in front of me.

15
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:53,040
Can you really get used to it?

16
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,079
I don't mean those external things,

17
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,200
like the intent power we're used to.

18
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,519
I mean the way people here think.

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,580
They're from
a completely different world.

20
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,400
There's a vast gulf between us,

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,799
like...

22
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,359
Like...

23
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:08,840
Like people and pigs.

24
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,280
Twelve years ago, someone told me.

25
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:14,400
When higher beings look at lower ones,

26
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,599
it's like a person looking at a pig.

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,439
But

28
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,840
that's not how it is.

29
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,319
They may not have Intent-to-Form,

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,400
or meta-artefacts that freeze time,

31
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,719
but they are not pigs.

32
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:31,439
They are just like us.

33
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,240
They are people.

34
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,759
Twelve years ago,

35
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,990
was it you who told him
that metaphor about people and pigs?

36
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,560
Were you the one who killed Lang

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,960
and brought me into this world?

38
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:50,039
Were you the one who killed Luo Sifu

39
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:51,360
and trapped me here?

40
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:15,879
I kept wondering,

41
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,719
why are you doing all this?

42
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,690
Until you deliberately

43
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,680
had the mountain attendant
say those words to me.

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,159
If all beings are equal,

45
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:25,759
there would be no conflict.

46
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,479
But Xu Huai's Word

47
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:30,120
can make someone
into a god among mortals.

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,159
An ordinary person

49
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,000
has a chance to become a god.

50
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:35,879
And that chance

51
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,400
is where conflict begins.

52
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,479
Have you made up your mind

53
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,120
about the path you'll take

54
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,479
in the face of this conflict?

55
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:46,039
Ordinary people

56
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:47,919
now have a chance to become gods.

57
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,039
Pigs can become human too.

58
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,479
That's me.

59
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:53,120
I think

60
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,960
I must have some ability
I don't know about.

61
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,840
An incredibly powerful one.

62
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,400
And it's the power you need.

63
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:00,879
Isn't it?

64
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:03,719
Yes, I do need your ability.

65
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,879
To help me accomplish something.

66
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:06,879
Something

67
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,520
that only you can help me accomplish.

68
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:13,240
And it's enough to change everyone's fate.

69
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,439
But right now, your power

70
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,439
is still far from enough.

71
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,040
You want me to help you?

72
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,079
I'm not someone you can order around.

73
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,600
Is there someone you love?

74
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,439
What's wrong?

75
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,560
Are you scared?

76
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,560
So you do have a weakness.

77
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:46,000
That means

78
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:48,079
what I ask you to do,

79
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,360
you can't run from it.

80
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:13,759
Did he believe you?

81
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:15,759
It seems he did.

82
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,879
But with his current level of intent power,

83
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:22,560
he's probably not strong enough
to help you complete it.

84
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:23,959
True.

85
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,639
Just being able to do Intent-to-Form

86
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:28,399
is nowhere near enough.

87
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:32,519
Looks like

88
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,199
I'll have to push him a bit harder.

89
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,399
Don't worry.

90
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,279
As long as I stay by his side,

91
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,600
I'll definitely find out

92
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,720
who he cares about the most.

93
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:49,800
Mm.

94
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,680
Why's there no one here?

95
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,990
Did they slack off
after seeing us go up the mountain?

96
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,360
Is that it?

97
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,279
No.

98
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:40,040
What is it?

99
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,399
Someone trashed Qian Gang

100
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:44,399
while we were gone.

101
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,480
What?

102
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,319
(Dong Mianhua Wonton)

103
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,240
The wonton shop...

104
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,800
Why is it closed so early?

105
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,540
(Dong Mianhua Wonton)

106
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:16,920
What happened here too?

107
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,120
Come out.

108
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,879
Stop smashing things.

109
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,279
What else is left to smash anyway?

110
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,279
Boss?

111
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,160
Boss.

112
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,720
What happened?

113
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:09,879
After the Third Master was killed,

114
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,439
the disciples clashed

115
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,199
with the chamber of commerce.

116
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,639
The officers seemed to be lying in wait.

117
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,110
As soon as the guys drew weapons,

118
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:20,519
those officers

119
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,279
took them all down.

120
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:26,160
Boss Du's shops

121
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,839
were divvied up by chamber members.

122
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,399
They forced them
to sell them at dirt-cheap prices.

123
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,639
Anyone who refused

124
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,799
got harassed every single day.

125
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,120
So I just shut my shop down.

126
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,279
Even if I starve,

127
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:42,240
I won't let them get their way.

128
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:45,799
Was it them smashing things again?

129
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:46,240
