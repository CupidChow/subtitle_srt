(Luo Jie Imprisoned)

3
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,479
Boss. One bowl of wontons, please.

4
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,079
Boss.

5
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:02,280
These wontons of yours

6
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,560
don't taste good anymore.

7
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:04,760
Huh?

8
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:06,390
There are several tables' worth

9
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:08,640
of wontons that have gone cold.

10
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:10,290
Clearly they've been
sitting for a while.

11
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:12,319
But this bowl is still full of wontons.

12
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,280
What,

13
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,840
no one wants to eat?

14
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,120
Then why even come inside?

15
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:33,879
Hello.

16
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,799
My father's killer.

17
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,359
He's inside the shop.

18
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,560
Don't move!

19
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,760
Relax.

20
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,920
I'm just helping you close the door.

21
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,599
Were you giving a signal?

22
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:18,319
No.

23
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:20,680
That's odd.

24
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:22,560
Why did the door close?

25
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:26,319
And he's walking down
the street like he owns it.

26
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,919
That doesn't make sense.

27
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,360
This looks

28
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,759
just like a trap.

29
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:33,960
Go find out what's going on.

30
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,319
Yes.

31
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,319
No wonder you're not scared.

32
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,680
You got help from Qian Gang.

33
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:43,840
Oh.

34
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,199
That's impossible.

35
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,159
Why would Qian Gang take orders from me?

36
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,800
I found out.

37
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,960
Someone went in

38
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,360
with a gun early this morning.

39
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,240
So they were waiting here to ambush us.

40
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,560
Don't believe me?

41
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:01,759
Watch this.

42
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,719
Get in here.

43
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:08,319
Now.

44
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,100
All of you, inside.

45
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:11,960
Still daring to provoke us?

46
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:18,560
Set the guns up.

47
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:20,360
Stay sharp and ready.

48
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,060
(Dong Mianhua Wonton)

49
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:27,039
They're all outside.

50
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,360
Want to test it?

51
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,879
Let's see if their aim

52
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,439
is better than my speed.

53
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,170
If someone dies,

54
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,039
it'll be you first.

55
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:39,919
First or later, what's the difference?

56
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,000
What matters is living or dying.

57
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,530
As long as I'm alive,

58
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,400
you all stay alive.

59
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:47,680
If I die,

60
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,039
you all die with me.

61
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,039
My father was murdered.

62
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:51,250
That's a grudge I can't let go.

63
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,439
But these people of yours,

64
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:58,879
are they really willing to die with you?

65
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:14,840
Young Master.

66
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,120
I don't want to die.

67
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:24,720
It's good to be alive.

68
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,639
Living is better.

69
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,639
So much trouble.

70
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,279
Murdering someone in broad daylight.

71
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:42,399
Aren't you afraid
the police will come for you?

72
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:44,480
By the time the police arrive,

73
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,240
there'll be no one left to testify.

74
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:56,839
Is that so?

75
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:00,040
Quite the crowd here.

76
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,279
Which one fired the shot?

77
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:03,920
I did.

78
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:06,900
The one
who just reported it at the station

79
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:07,959
was him.

80
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,839
Inspector Ye.

81
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:11,199
Hurry up and take me to prison.

82
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,680
The same one where Du Shisan is held.

83
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:17,690
Anyone who schemes against me

84
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:19,279
must pay the price.

85
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:20,800
Take him away.

86
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,560
You may go now.

87
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,360
Leave?

88
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,759
May I ask what this is all about?

89
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,199
The man who killed Luo Sifu confessed.

90
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:55,279
And about the shooting that day,

91
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:56,279
he confessed to that too.

92
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,320
It has nothing to do with you.

93
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:09,000
(It's Luo Jie.)

94
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,959
Is this some kind of execution?

95
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,199
That's none of your concern.

96
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,759
I want to see Inspector Ye.

97
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,319
Boss Du.

98
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,120
Isn't this exactly what you wanted?

99
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,470
What are you even doing here?

100
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,560
What did he say about you?

101
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,519
He said you're the one
who killed Luo Sifu.

102
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:38,399
Impossible.

103
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,160
And how can you be so sure?

104
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,079
Because he knows

105
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,920
who the real killer is.

106
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:53,680
I knew it.

107
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,639
Inspector Ye wouldn't abuse
your authority.

108
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,399
Just to see me,

109
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:00,399
you really went to great lengths.

110
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:04,160
Even knowing it was a trap,

111
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,680
you still came.

112
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,519
It's complicated.

113
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,680
I was worried

114
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:10,639
about his life.

115
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,959
Inspector Ye.

116
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,279
I need to have

117
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,519
a private word with him.

118
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,810
If it's something
you can't say in front of the police,

119
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,160
then it must be something
I need to know.

120
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,879
I'm not leaving.

121
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,600
This is the confession I just wrote.

122
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,730
It's enough to lock me up for ten years.

123
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,680
Do you remember I once told you

124
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,800
about that night

125
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,720
when someone was trying to kill me?

126
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:13,519
You met someone.

127
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:14,560
He saved you.

128
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:16,759
He told me

129
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,279
what would happen to me
over the next twenty years.

130
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,839
Every single one.

131
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,040
He got them all right.

132
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,120
A fortune-teller?

133
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:27,879
He also told me

134
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:29,759
about Luo Sifu's death.

135
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,920
He said

136
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,559
the Qian Gang in your hands

137
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,000
would thrive.

138
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:38,600
I never believed in any of that.

139
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:41,840
Believe it or not,

140
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,240
you'll know once you meet him.

141
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,320
Twenty-four years ago, I did.

142
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:48,320
Twelve years ago, so did Luo Sifu.

143
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,639
We both fought
for the chance to meet him

144
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,080
and received

145
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:54,120
Xu Huai's Word.

146
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,480
That's how we achieved
what we have today.

147
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,679
The one who won Xu Huai's Word
twenty-four years ago

148
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:04,080
was Master Shisan.

149
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,000
Xu Huai's Word?

150
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,879
Mm.

151
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,840
But I'm locked up here.

152
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,360
How am I supposed to get out?

153
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,240
All these years in the underworld

154
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:32,120
weren't for nothing.

155
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:42,320
What?

156
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:44,200
Let him go?

157
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:45,720
All right.

158
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:47,679
You're the chief.

159
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:48,720
That's your call.

160
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:02,440
Well.

161
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,840
Isn't this the mighty

162
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,000
Second Master of Qian Gang, Zhu Que?

163
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:09,600
Even you have your eyes on Xu Huai's Word.

164
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,639
No wonder.

165
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,080
With a temptation that great,

166
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,879
who could resist?

167
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,399
Wouldn't you say so?

168
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,710
So few people
got on the train this time.

169
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,559
The winner must be Qian Gang

170
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:24,610
or the Chamber of Commerce.

171
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:25,879
Second Master.

172
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,000
On this journey,

173
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,519
we'll count on you.

174
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,310
The train hasn't even left yet.

175
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:38,919
Nothing's certain.

182
00:10:59,159 --> 00:10:59,960
One ticket, please.

183
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,480
(Your task is)

184
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:15,720
(to do whatever it takes)

185
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,320
