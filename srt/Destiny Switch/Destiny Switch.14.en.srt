(A Special Deal)

3
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,400
That strange sound

4
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:34,200
scared a lot of people away.

5
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:35,920
I don't believe in ghosts.

6
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,120
I only believe people
pretend to be them.

7
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,680
You mean...

8
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,000
Maybe

9
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:47,959
the secret behind the sigh

10
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:49,200
is a clue to finding Xu Huai Long.

11
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:50,920
Let's split up and search.

12
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,960
I knew you'd come find me.

13
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,960
You're that turtle
Qi mentioned, aren't you?

14
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:01,439
I just wander around and go back soon.

15
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:13,360
Come out.

16
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,879
I'm a civilized man.

17
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,479
If you won't come out,

18
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,400
I'll find someone uncivilized

19
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:20,840
to drag you out.

20
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,199
Young Master Luo,

21
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:35,280
you're in luck.

22
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:36,960
Whoever finds me today

23
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,599
will receive the ultimate weapon.

24
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,280
What is this?

25
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,319
These are the weapons
you surrendered at the station.

26
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:46,639
Right now, everyone is unarmed.

27
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,719
But with this,

28
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:49,520
you'll be invincible.

29
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,120
There's guns,

30
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,120
poison,

31
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,680
explosives...

32
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:55,039
Anything you need.

33
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:58,120
You want me to kill someone?

34
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,479
That way,

35
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:03,240
you'll be the only one
to see Xu Huai Long.

36
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,360
And I

37
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:06,039
will get off work earlier.

38
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:08,919
This is murder.

39
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,400
What do you want?

40
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,520
Whatever it is you desire,

41
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,159
Xu Huai's Word can make it happen.

42
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,839
Isn't that

43
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,480
worth more than the lives

44
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,959
of a few strangers?

45
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,839
If you don't get it now,

46
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,839
you will eventually.

47
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:28,240
Seems you don't want these things.

48
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,880
Then let me offer a line instead.

49
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:32,360
If all beings were equal,

50
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,680
there would be no conflict.

51
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,720
But Xu Huai's Word

52
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:36,959
has the power to make

53
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:38,720
someone a god among mortals.

54
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,759
A mere mortal

55
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,480
gains the chance to become divine

56
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:44,240
and that,

57
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,920
is how conflict begins.

58
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:49,000
Think carefully,

59
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,519
in the face of this conflict,

60
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:52,040
which path will you take?

61
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:14,560
Did you find the source of the sigh?

62
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,360
Not yet.

63
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,180
Something happened at the inn.

64
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:17,879
What is it?

65
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:28,800
Not poisoned.

66
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,580
Not injured either.

67
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,120
They're just in a deep sleep.

68
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,720
I found two more in other rooms,

69
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,240
same condition.

70
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,160
There's something wrong with this inn.

71
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:20,920
Help me walk in a bit.

72
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,000
You okay?

73
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,279
I knew you'd be fine.

74
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,680
I just wanted to know who'd show up

75
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,560
after I passed out.

76
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,360
Before we climbed the mountain,

77
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,990
we handed over
all our weapons and poison.

78
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,160
You people from the martial world

79
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,319
are good
at sneaking things up here, aren't you?

80
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,510
So, are you going to frisk me?

81
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:45,240
Come on.

82
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,040
I've been with you
this whole time since we arrived.

83
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,370
When would I have had the chance?

84
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:48,839
Hey.

85
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:51,399
Did you catch a chill in the forest?

86
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,360
You dared to leave me out there?

87
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,040
Inspector Ye,

88
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:57,519
this is a serious case.

89
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,120
Let's not get caught up
in the small stuff.

90
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,920
Even if these people
are only unconscious,

91
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,120
still there are too many shady characters
on this mountain.

92
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,959
We need to get them down
for treatment as soon as possible.

93
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:10,759
Take them down the mountain?

94
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,040
That means

95
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:14,399
the attendants here
were already prepared

96
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:15,879
with stretchers to carry people down.

97
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,800
And they also said

98
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:20,490
that the train to go down the mountain
was ready to depart anytime.

99
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:20,800
Hey.

100
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,360
Inspector Ye.

101
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,199
I get it now.

102
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,079
The attendants are the prime suspects.

103
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:25,560
However...

104
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,600
Why did they all pass out

105
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,680
while you're all fine?

106
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,759
Good question.

107
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,319
But

108
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,680
solving that mystery
is your job, Inspector Ye.

109
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,480
It's nearly dawn.

110
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,480
I'm heading back to bed.

111
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,439
Let's go.

112
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,720
The problem lies on Mount Huai'en.

113
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,360
I need to find that attendant.

114
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,420
(Three days left.
Fourteen people remaining)

115
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,920
The slope is steep.

116
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,839
Be careful.

117
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:15,950
- Understood.
- Understood.

118
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,399
We're short on help.

119
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,559
Could you lend a hand?

120
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,200
How did you know

121
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,000
he'd suddenly collapse like that?

122
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,759
How could I possibly know that?

123
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:54,960
Hurry up.

124
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,200
The mountain path

125
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,600
gets harder at night.

126
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,799
You take that end.

127
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:28,240
You're being awfully obvious.

128
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,000
Seems like

129
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:33,399
you're all working together.

130
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,360
If we didn't band together,

131
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:42,519
how could we deal
with the young master of Qian Gang?

132
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:46,879
Take him away.

133
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:48,440
Move.

134
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,480
Luckily

135
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,639
someone else triggered that trap for us.

136
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,840
With all these martial world tricks,

137
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,440
we never would've made it through.

138
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:14,200
Let's go.

139
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,720
Alright.

140
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,490
This is the place.

141
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:34,960
Kneel.

142
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,679
Once we deal with you,

143
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,720
the rest will be easier.

144
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,559
Time to send you on your way.

145
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,240
Third Hall, Xuanwu.

146
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,200
Greetings, Young Master.

147
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:53,180
Greetings, Young Master.

148
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:03,480
I knew you'd come looking for me.

149
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,559
You're the turtle
Qi talked about, right?

150
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:12,879
She told me

151
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,320
she recognised you.

152
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:16,120
Said you're a mighty turtle.

153
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,840
I suppose

154
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,600
she was talking about

155
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,120
our Qian Gang's Third Master,

156
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,799
master of disguise,

157
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,840
Xuanwu.

158
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,200
The Boss often spoke of you.

159
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,679
Watching you along the way,

160
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:30,000
I've realised

161
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,080
you're quite interesting.

162
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,679
I need your help.

163
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:34,600
Qi's been captured.

164
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:35,360
Help me save her.

165
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,320
It's about time those arrogant fools

166
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:55,799
