(The Young Master's Scheme)

3
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:06,760
You...

4
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:08,680
Do you know Du Shisan?

5
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:09,879
Who?

6
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,000
Du Shisan, the boss of Qian Gang.

7
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:14,599
Why do you ask?

8
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,480
Four years ago,

9
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,090
on the night of the eighth
of the twelfth month,

10
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,599
Du Shisan personally led men
into your fabric shop.

11
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,159
Did he or not?

12
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:25,040
The city's gangs...

13
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:27,640
I've had too many run-ins

14
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,079
with them.

15
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,719
Those groups
do whatever they want in town.

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,959
They rob, they kill.

17
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:33,920
People like us,

18
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,000
we just want to run
an honest little business.

19
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,599
But those guys
didn't have to lift a finger.

20
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:41,480
They just played cards
in front of our doors.

21
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:43,680
All fierce and threatening.

22
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,879
Who would dare come in?

23
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,120
Months went by
without a single customer.

24
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,599
We couldn't hold out any longer.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,480
What else could we do

26
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,599
but pay protection?

27
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:55,640
And that protection money,

28
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:58,400
was it collected by Du Shisan himself?

29
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,760
Du Shisan?

30
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,560
I never said it was Du Shisan.

31
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,959
I said it was the Axe Gang of Qian Gang

32
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:07,000
who used to extort us.

33
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,199
Hey.

34
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:11,199
But on the eighth night
of the twelfth month four years ago,

35
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,319
Du Shisan personally lay in
wait at my shop.

36
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,240
Because I trusted him.

37
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,510
I believed him when he said
I didn't need to pay protection.

38
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,960
I believed he would take care of it.

39
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,840
But something happened
the very first night.

40
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:25,080
The Axe Gang stormed into my shop.

41
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,190
They were going to wreck it.

42
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,439
I thought it was all over.

43
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,680
But luckily,

44
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,240
Du Shisan showed up.

45
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:32,759
He kept his word.

46
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:36,080
Everything I said is true.

47
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,479
If you want
to charge Master Shisan with something,

48
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,520
I can make up a lie for you.

49
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,479
One that fits all your charges.

50
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:56,180
(Dong Mianhua Wonton)

51
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,230
Put those over there.

52
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,380
Place everything over there.

53
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:03,759
Set the tables properly.

54
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:11,840
I...

55
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,690
I'm here to see Young Master Luo Jie.

56
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,840
It's already so late.

57
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,159
Oh.

58
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,199
You must be the Young Madam.

59
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,879
You're the Young Madam?

60
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,599
Shut it.

61
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:35,599
It's the First and Second Madam?

62
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,280
Shut it!

63
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,520
Oh dear.

64
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:42,439
You really work hard.

65
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:44,199
Girls these days have such bad tempers.

66
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,599
And that Inspector Ye too...

67
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,400
Good thing you
have nothing to do with her.

68
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,479
Shut your mouth.

69
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,599
I brought you some soup.

70
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,080
Am I interrupting?

71
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:58,319
How did it go?

72
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,080
Don't worry.

73
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:01,360
With my silver tongue,

74
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,400
I stood up for Boss Du at the station.

75
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,599
Spoke with reason.

76
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:08,319
Even though Inspector Ye
was deliberately making it hard,

77
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:09,560
but...

78
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,360
Get to the point.

79
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,120
Yes.

80
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,380
Right now, the police have no grounds
to charge Boss Du.

81
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,120
He'll be released very soon.

82
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,240
Hey.

83
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,140
Are you not feeling well?

84
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,000
Oh.

85
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:29,079
No, I'm fine.

86
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,160
Ah...

87
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,990
I just thought, since Boss Du
and Xu Huai Long go way back,

88
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,690
if I help get him out, I might get
a better read on Xu Huai Long.

89
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:37,680
What do you think?

90
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:39,120
Sounds good.

91
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:41,399
Well.

92
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:42,519
I've delivered the soup.

93
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:43,759
It's getting late,

94
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:44,879
I'll head back now.

95
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:53,439
Qi.

96
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:56,190
Keep an eye on her.

97
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:57,120
Got it.

98
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:03,319
What?

99
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:04,990
They dropped the charges?

100
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,680
No one's pressing charges
against Du Shisan anymore.

101
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:17,190
They're even accusing
the police of forcing them to lie.

102
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,279
Why?

103
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:25,480
Before Du Shisan went to prison,

104
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:28,480
he stood toe to toe
with the chamber of commerce.

105
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:32,720
But now those same merchants
are keeping their heads down.

106
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,319
Not one of them dares to speak up.

107
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,959
Because of Xu Huai's Word.

108
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:38,120
No one dares cross

109
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,680
Luo Jie of Xu Huai's Word.

110
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,519
The seven-day detention limit
is about to expire.

111
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:47,480
Looks like we'll have no choice
but to release Du Shisan.

112
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,639
Or maybe

113
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:52,800
we should go after Luo Jie instead.

114
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:53,920
After all,

115
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:56,480
he's still implicated
in Luo Sifu's murder.

116
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,340
(Loyalty and Righteousness
Through the Ages)

117
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,120
My dad says

118
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,279
people who hide and spy on others

119
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,639
are always plotting something bad.

120
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,199
I wasn't doing that.

121
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:11,040
Dad also says

122
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:13,439
the more someone denies it,

123
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:14,959
the guiltier they are.

124
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:17,600
You better not try anything.

125
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,199
I'm a guest

126
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,160
of your Young Master, you know.

127
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,319
Qi.

128
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:38,560
It's fine now.

129
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,319
Am I that annoying?

130
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,720
Maybe I shouldn't have come here.

131
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:45,639
Qi was just messing with you.

132
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,319
Young Master.

133
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:52,500
Inspector Ye wants to see you.

134
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,399
You really are something,
Young Master of Qian Gang.

135
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,600
A dozen people listed
in Du Shisan's confession

136
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,319
are saying in unison

137
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,879
they were never harmed by him.

138
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:05,240
So then,

139
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,240
how did the vast empire of Qian Gang

140
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,079
rise to power?

141
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,399
The whole city knows.

142
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,959
Qian Gang's success

143
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,240
came from Xu Huai's Word.

144
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:15,720
Xu Huai's Word...

145
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:19,240
What a miraculous thing
Xu Huai's Word has become.

146
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,830
Do you have time, Young Master?

147
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:24,360
Come with me somewhere.

148
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:26,040
Sure.

149
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,039
Qi.

150
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,080
Tell me.

151
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,039
Does your Young Master
care more about you,

152
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,960
or about Inspector Ye?

153
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,559
It's definitely not you.

154
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:49,600
Hmph.

155
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,720
But I need to know
who he cares about most

156
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:59,039
before I make my move.

157
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,990
You say the one who pulled
the trigger wasn't the killer.

158
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:56,720
Then today,

159
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:01,000
let's clear up everything
that happened back then.

160
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,039
Inspector Ye.

161
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,799
Let me tell it.

162
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,120
Back then,

163
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,480
I was hiding here.

164
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,559
I saw it with my own eyes.

165
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:13,870
