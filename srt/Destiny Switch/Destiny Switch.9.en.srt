=Episode 9=
(Breakthrough to Board)

3
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:53,840
The train hasn't even moved yet.

4
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:56,679
Still up in the air.

5
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,200
One ticket, please.

6
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,439
This guy's insane.

7
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:25,120
All for Xu Huai's Word.

8
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,000
Everyone's gone mad for it.

9
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,159
Qi.

10
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,280
You're not thinking
of helping him, are you?

11
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,879
The boss got arrested,

12
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,799
and it's all connected to him.

13
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:55,799
Sold out?

14
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,000
You really know nothing?

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,799
This train to Mount Huaien

16
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:04,079
only runs once every twelve years.

17
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,040
But the tickets

18
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,360
aren't for sale.

19
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,840
Then how do you board?

20
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,240
There are four tickets left.

21
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,199
Like beasts fighting over prey.

22
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,039
Get it?

23
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,000
Three tickets left.

24
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,120
Two tickets left.

25
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,879
Isn't there

26
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:19,960
a more civilized way?

27
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:21,159
Civilized?

28
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:25,319
Only two kinds
of people get civilization.

29
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,639
The rich.

30
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:41,719
It's mine.

31
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:42,840
Mine!

32
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:43,840
My money!

33
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:46,319
Mine!

34
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:51,960
And the power.

35
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,839
They're all top-tier fighters.

36
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,240
Maybe you should leave.

37
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,000
The rule is,

38
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:46,040
if I reach the train door,

39
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,759
I can board, right?

40
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,120
Life or death doesn't matter.

41
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:51,360
If you can make it to the door,

42
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:52,759
then you can go

43
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,240
to the place where Xu Huai Long is.

44
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:19,959
And also,

45
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,800
the road to Xu Huai's Word

46
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,560
is extremely dangerous.

47
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,800
But to get the truth,

48
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:30,720
are you willing to risk your life?

49
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,399
Get up.

50
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:28,480
Only one ticket left.

51
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:32,160
If he can't pass this round,

52
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:35,519
then what awaits him at the destination

53
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,680
will be even worse.

54
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,160
Stop right there.

55
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:51,120
Forget it.

56
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,879
Fighting's not what you're good at.

57
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,959
What you're good at

58
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:56,120
is barking like a dog.

59
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:57,920
Killing your own dad.

60
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,879
I didn't kill him.

61
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:04,079
Then who did?

62
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,319
A ghost?

63
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:07,360
There are no ghosts in this world.

64
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,319
Only people playing tricks.

65
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,839
They say

66
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:12,519
the answer

67
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,360
lies at the end of this train ride.

68
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,519
So,

69
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,639
I have to get on that train.

70
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,240
Luo Sifu.

71
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,000
I swear

72
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:27,799
I'll get revenge for you.

73
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:32,159

74
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:34,519
