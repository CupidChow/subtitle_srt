(Crisis on All Sides)

3
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,480
Why did you kill my dad?

4
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,879
I didn't.

5
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:15,719
I'll ask you one last time.

6
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,439
Why did you kill my dad?

7
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,000
I

8
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:41,719
didn't

9
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,200
do it.

10
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,599
That's not enough.

11
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,239
Killing you just like that,

12
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:06,319
it'd be letting you off easy.

13
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:12,479
Let's play a game.

14
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,199
If you don't agree,

15
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:19,439
this woman...

16
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:23,520
I'll cut off her hands and feet,

17
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,120
strip her naked,

18
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,320
and throw her into a beggar's den.

19
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,439
How's that?

20
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,360
Fine.

21
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,439
I'll play with you.

22
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,550
Don't hurt me.

23
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:16,199
Don't hurt me!

24
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:17,910
Don't come after me!

25
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,660
It's too scary!

26
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,620
I want to go down the mountain.

27
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:20,439
I want to go back!

28
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:28,360
As expected,

29
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,879
once night falls,

30
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,919
(the real slaughter begins.)

31
00:03:59,130 --> 00:03:59,919
Where's the candle?

32
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:35,879
Unbelievable.

33
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:37,800
You'd even kill your own brother

34
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,519
just for Xu Huai's Word?

35
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,759
Brothers of Qian Gang,

36
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,040
on my command,

37
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,199
take him down.

38
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,959
How is this my doing?

39
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,199
You even killed your father.

40
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:52,199
What won't you do?

41
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:53,959
Sure, I had a reason to kill,

42
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:55,279
but up on this mountain,

43
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,319
who doesn't want to kill?

44
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,000
Still,

45
00:04:58,319 --> 00:04:59,480
with Zhu Que's skill,

46
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,080
if someone wounded him head-on

47
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:02,439
without making a sound,

48
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:04,120
it must be someone close to him.

49
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,800
But that's not me.

50
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,879
I'm the one
who barked like a dog in public,

51
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:08,879
killed his own father in secret,

52
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:10,610
and framed the Boss
to send him to prison.

53
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,639
Among the Qian Gang,

54
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,399
everyone hates me to the bone.

55
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,000
There's no way I'd be that quiet

56
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,660
while stabbing Zhu Que
right in the open.

57
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:18,800
I think

58
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,310
the one who did it

59
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,399
could only be...

60
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,240
You drugged him first.

61
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:26,959
Once drugged, he couldn't fight back.

62
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,920
Master White Tiger, what foresight.

63
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,120
How do you know
Master Zhu Que was drugged?

64
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,959
Unless

65
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:34,560
you were the one who drugged him?

66
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:37,399
Why would I harm him?

67
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:38,959
Kill Zhu Que, frame me,

68
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,100
and the Qian Gang up here
will follow your orders.

69
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,240
That's your goal, isn't it?

70
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,199
What nonsense are you spouting?

71
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,680
All the candles in the hall were taken.

72
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,199
By the time Zhu Que arrived,

73
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,759
there should've
only been one candle left.

74
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,480
He lit the candle,

75
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,530
but it had already been laced
with knockout smoke.

76
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:08,759
Once the candle burned,

77
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:10,000
the knockout smoke ignited too.

78
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,959
Then the killer struck,

79
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,800
injured Zhu Que and hid.

80
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,759
They made a sound

81
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,360
to frame me as the scapegoat.

82
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,439
Master White Tiger,

83
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,680
what I said

84
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,000
make sense?

85
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,480
All just excuses.

86
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:29,199
It's easy to find out if it's true.

87
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:31,000
I believe you've still got

88
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,639
the antidote to
that knockout smoke on you.

89
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:36,920
Humph.

90
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,079
Master.

91
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,000
Wake up, Master.

92
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,720
You picked the wrong scapegoat.

93
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,040
What happened to your martial arts?

94
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,279
They've always been terrible.

95
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,879
I can only bully nobodies like that.

96
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:18,639
You mean me?

97
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,160
Hey.

98
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,720
You are one of my defeated foes.

99
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,240
You cheated in that fight.

100
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,879
You didn't even make a move.

101
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,439
Still...

102
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:28,519
Too slow.

103
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:34,920
If none of your moves can hit me,

104
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:36,319
have you ever thought

105
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:38,160
if I did attack,

106
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,399
before you even saw it,

107
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:40,879
your head would already be rolling.

108
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,439
There's no such move.

109
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:44,319
Try it.

110
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,959
Until we meet again.

111
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:08,079
You were bluffing earlier.

112
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,439
But if he hadn't believed you,

113
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,319
White Tiger might've struck you down

114
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,279
for Xu Huai's Word.

115
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:16,000
Then what?

116
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,199
Had to take the risk.

117
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,520
- Thank you for saving the Master.
- Thank you for saving the Master.

118
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,639
Looks like you don't have the skill
to protect yourself.

119
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,399
Don't you already know
I'm not that capable?

120
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,919
If you didn't believe me,

121
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,000
you could've just said so.

122
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,280
If I'd so much as moved just now,

123
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:37,440
I'd be dead already.

124
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:39,919
Young Master.

125
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,639
Qian Gang values loyalty above all.

126
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,690
You just risked your life
for your brothers.

127
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:48,840
I, Zhu Que,

128
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,399
as per the Boss's wishes,

129
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,240
will wholeheartedly

130
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,799
serve the Young Master.

131
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,660
- Wholeheartedly
- Wholeheartedly

132
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,310
- serve the Young Master.
- serve the Young Master.

133
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:12,639
You want Qian Gang

134
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,080
to be your lapdogs?

135
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,679
You...

136
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:17,080
Take your dogs,

137
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,919
and help me get Xu Huai's Word.

138
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:20,960
