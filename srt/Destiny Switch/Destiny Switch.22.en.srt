=Episode 22=
(The Terrifying Woman)

3
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:14,840
Let me tell you a story.

4
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,190
Mermaids cry tears
that turn into pearls.

5
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,680
So their tears are very valuable.

6
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:21,719
But the mermaids don't know that.

7
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,439
Do you know why?

8
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,239
Because their world is too happy.

9
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:27,400
They never cry.

10
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:29,319
So what should be done?

11
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:30,959
Well,

12
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:33,680
a kind soul brought a knife...

13
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:35,680
Kill...

14
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:37,519
Kill...

15
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:38,959
Kill.

16
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,879
When they saw their loved ones die,

17
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:43,000
the mermaids felt pain

18
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,280
and they cried.

19
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,760
Endless pearls

20
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,280
just like that.

21
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,159
You mean

22
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,640
your goal is to kill me,

23
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:58,480
so Luo Jie will be in pain?

24
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,760
Like killing
just to collect mermaid tears?

25
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:05,920
So clever.

26
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:12,960
Don't get it wrong.

27
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,479
He doesn't have feelings for me.

28
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,879
If you want him to feel pain,

29
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,120
killing me won't work.

30
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:23,680
That's fine.

31
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,159
You're the first.

32
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:26,759
There are many more.

33
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:28,719
But what if...

34
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:30,199
What if your death

35
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,000
triggers his full potential?

36
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,560
Then it means he loves you.

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,479
Don't you want to know?

38
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:38,039
Even I'm curious.

39
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:41,060
It's all right.

40
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,719
I don't feel pain.

41
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,919
With blood as the offering,

42
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,879
let the great power descend.

43
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:55,759
It's strange.

44
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,840
It's a story.

45
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,879
Story about mermaids.

46
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,719
She said she wants
a mermaid to cry pearls.

47
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:02,600
She's waiting for you.

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Go. You need to go.

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,360
You finally came.

50
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,199
Do you feel it?

51
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,719
Can you feel the intent power
forming inside you?

52
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:31,719
Yes.

53
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:35,960
Everything I've done
is to help you break through your limit.

54
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,039
Pain.

55
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,479
Only pain...

56
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:58,919
You've made progress.

57
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:01,960
But it's still not enough.

58
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:08,520
Don't!

59
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:20,439
You're insane.

60
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,399
After you arrived, the Metarealm

61
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,959
was plunged into bloodshed for the sake
of breaking intent power.

62
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,519
A grand intent master,
wielding Intent-to-Ether, descended

63
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,680
and became
the new ruler of the Metarealm.

64
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:39,600
A world reborn...

65
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:41,480
What a beautiful vision.

66
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,480
Come.

67
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,360
Let's go again.

68
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,199
Keep going!

69
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,680
You're close to breaking through.

70
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:26,319
Almost there.

71
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,680
They said,

72
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:41,519
to make a mermaid cry pearls,

73
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,560
they'll keep killing people.

74
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:47,240
Killing the ones mermaids love.

75
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,439
Next,

76
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:56,000
she'll come after the people around you.

77
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:04,319
Don't worry about me.

78
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,160
It's useless.

79
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,480
We're from different worlds.

80
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,399
Aren't we?

81
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,800
I knew it.

82
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,560
What I wanted

83
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:42,600
I can't have anymore.

84
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,279
Don't be scared.

85
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:09,839
I'll protect you.

86
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,680
Because I'm a cop.

87
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,120
Run.

88
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,199
What

89
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,079
are you doing?

90
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,780
(Ye)

91
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:26,480
You must stay alive.

92
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,390
So this is what it looks like
being injured by Intent-to-Ether.

93
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,200
He really is the chosen one.

94
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:01,919
He has already endured
the pain of death three times,

95
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,759
building up his rage.

96
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,120
He just needs
to suffer three more losses, then...

97
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,399
He will fully break through.

98
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,480
The Metarealm

99
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:13,759
can be saved.

100
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,360
But his Intent-to-Ether

101
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:18,960
only managed to scratch the surface.

102
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,080
Not enough.

103
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:21,679
I need to help him more.

104
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,100
(The Noble Spirit of Pine and Cypress)

105
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:05,279
Qi.

106
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,799
Stop fooling around.

107
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,519
How did you know it was me?

108
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,799
Is my martial arts getting weak?

109
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,600
I used to come and go without a trace.

110
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,720
When I was little,

111
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,039
that's how my dad would comfort me.

112
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,519
It's okay now.

113
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:53,600
It's all right.

114
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,919
You still have me, don't you?

115
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,440
If

116
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,320
I had listened to Dad
and stayed with you all along,

117
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,360
maybe you wouldn't have
had to go through all this.

118
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:31,120
You have to behave.

119
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,120
Because

120
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,399
I promised Dad

121
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:35,440
I'd protect you.

122
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:36,919
And when I, Qi, make a promise,

123
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:38,240
I always keep it.

124
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:41,519
So

125
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,320
don't sneak off
when I'm not looking, all right?

126
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,200
