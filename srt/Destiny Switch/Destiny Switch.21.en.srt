(The Truth Revealed)

3
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,990
You said the one
who raised the gun wasn't the killer.

4
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,239
Then today,

5
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:19,239
tell us everything that happened back then.

6
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:22,400
Inspector Ye,

7
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:24,159
let me explain.

8
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:29,120
At the time,

9
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,280
I was hiding here.

10
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,480
I saw it with my own eyes.

11
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,690
I know you have a pocket watch!

12
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,200
But how about we test it,

13
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,280
are you quicker
at pulling out the watch,

14
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:41,120
or am I quicker at pulling the trigger?

15
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:49,599
Hands up.

16
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,719
Hands up!

17
00:01:58,439 --> 00:01:59,519
What are you doing?

18
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,170
If he's guilty,
I'll be the one to convict him.

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,680
Inspector Ye,

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,490
you went all the way to Mount Huai'en,

21
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:10,879
and you're still clinging
to your sense of justice?

22
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,280
Can you even arrest him?

23
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,919
You couldn't even convict Du Shisan.

24
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:16,360
What justice are you upholding?

25
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:20,599
Luo En, what are you trying to do?

26
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,439
Give me the pocket watch.

27
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,080
Give it to me!

28
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,039
Do you believe

29
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:16,719
what you saw

30
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,759
wasn't the truth?

31
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:49,800
With this pocket watch,

32
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,560
you can kill anyone you want,

33
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:57,080
then pin it on someone else.

34
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:59,790
Even Inspector Ye
could figure that out instantly.

35
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,919
Did it not occur to you?

36
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:01,639
Shut up!

37
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,220
Have you thought about this?

38
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,719
The moment you got that pocket watch,
you should have realized

39
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:07,790
you blamed the wrong person.

40
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,400
You already knew

41
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:10,840
bullets can be stopped,

42
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,120
time can be controlled.

43
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,280
So have you considered

44
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,919
when you saw me raise that gun,

45
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:16,399
my time

46
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,279
was being manipulated too?

47
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:27,519
That's impossible.

48
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,360
I saw it with my own eyes.

49
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:33,959
Your father

50
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,680
was my best friend.

51
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,199
Even if you didn't kill him,

52
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:46,639
he still died the moment you showed up.

53
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:50,720
Because of you!

54
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,120
Yes, because of me!

55
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,480
I was the one who caused his death.

56
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,900
That's why I need revenge even more.

57
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,879
The real killer

58
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,199
was Xu Huai Long.

59
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,759
Xu Huai Long...

60
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:19,439
Xu Huai Long...

61
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,079
Can you kill him?

62
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:24,800
If it were you,

63
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:26,439
with such a gap in power,

64
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,639
would you give up revenge?

65
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:28,240
No!

66
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,360
Then neither will I!

67
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,000
Watch out for Shelly.

68
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,720
She was the one
who made me use Ye Sijia.

69
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:12,040
She wanted to see
where Ye Sijia stands in your heart.

70
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,800
I don't know what she's planning.

71
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,439
She's a dangerous person.

72
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,319
Luo En.

73
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,519
I'll give your father

74
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,639
the justice he deserves.

75
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:12,920
You...

76
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,480
You're not who you used to be.

77
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,079
Is that so?

78
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,959
Then who exactly are you now?

79
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,399
You and I

80
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,079
are not the same kind of person.

81
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,880
This is a key piece of evidence.

82
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:43,399
I'm taking it back.

83
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,160
That's for the best.

84
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:49,399
It'll be safer that way.

85
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,410
Come to the station tomorrow
and take Du Shisan with you.

86
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:05,839
I know you need his help.

87
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,440
Are you really going to
go up against Xu Huai Long?

88
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,000
This is the path I must take.

89
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,320
I can help you.

90
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,480
This is my journey alone.

91
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,820
(Ye)

92
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,559
You've kept this with you all along?

93
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,120
It was never mine to begin with.

94
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:39,960
It's time it returned
to its rightful owner.

95
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:54,240
You must stay alive.

96
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:13,320
Go.

97
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,200
You've seen Xu Huai Long?

98
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,790
He's the one who killed Luo Sifu.

99
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,639
So you really didn't know what he did?

100
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,960
In my heart,

101
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:39,559
he was like a god.

102
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:42,240
I thought it was a prophecy.

103
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,519
It wasn't a prophecy.

104
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:44,919
It was a warning.

105
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:46,159
He was warning us

106
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:47,559
who he planned to kill.

107
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,080
Do you know

108
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,679
what he's going to do next?

109
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,039
But I do know

110
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:58,600
he's been waiting
for you since 24 years ago.

111
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,150
Waiting for you to appear.

112
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,279
Right.

113
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,279
There's a girl named Shelly.

114
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:07,720
She's been deliberately following me.

115
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:08,399
Do you think

116
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:10,039
Xu Huai Long sent her?

117
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,279
Shelly?

118
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:13,480
Oh,

119
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,440
that girl.

120
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,399
I met her once.

121
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:19,559
She said

122
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,440
it was boring at Mount Huai'en,

123
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,799
because Xu Huai Long had no new friends,

124
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:24,679
no new lovers.

125
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,480
So she had no way

126
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,240
to kill the people he loved.

127
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,360
That made her even stronger.

128
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,390
I didn't understand it at the time.

129
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,960
I thought she was just talking nonsense.

130
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:38,559
I didn't think much of it.

131
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,679
What's wrong?

132
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:42,720
Are you afraid?

133
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:45,840
So

134
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,559
you do have a weakness.

135
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:49,200
Which means

136
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:51,320
you can't run

137
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,639
from what I ask of you.

138
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,080
Kill the one he loves.

139
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,039
That will make her stronger?

140
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:19,240
What's wrong?

141
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,759
You asked me to follow Shelly

142
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:22,440
and see what she was secretly doing.

143
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,960
But I lost track of her.

144
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,360
It's all right as long as you're safe.

145
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:27,399
But

146
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:29,080
she did tell me what she planned to do.

147
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,720
What is it?

148
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:30,840
She said

149
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,399
she wants to find someone
who will break your heart

150
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:34,960
and play a game with them.

151
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:36,960
If she plans to hurt someone,

152
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,320
who would it be?

153
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:41,120
Be careful with Shelly.

154
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,879
She was the one who had me use Ye Sijia.

155
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,559
She wanted to see
how important Ye Sijia is to you.

156
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,840
I don't know what she plans to do.

157
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,080
She's a dangerous person.

158
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,440
Inspector Ye!

159
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:09,960
You're here.

160
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:11,360
How did you know I'd come?

161
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:13,720
Just now, one of Officer Ye's
friends came by

162
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,480
and said you'd surely want
to know where she went.

163
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:18,039
She left a message for you.

164
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,200
What did she say?

165
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:20,279
It's strange.

166
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,279
It was a story.

167
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:22,840
