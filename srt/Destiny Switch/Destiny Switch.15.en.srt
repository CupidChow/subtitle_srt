=Episode 15=
(Rescuing the Seventh Master)

3
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,479
It's about time those smug men

4
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,960
see what Qian Gang is really made of.

5
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:23,280
Ow.

6
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:25,280
This martial world lot
really has it rough.

7
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,760
At this rate,
someone's going to get beaten to death.

8
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,079
Hit me with all you've got.

9
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:44,760
Luo Jie of Qian Gang
doesn't bow to anyone.

10
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,319
Who's there?

11
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:52,799
It's me.

12
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,000
From the Chamber,

13
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:54,680
Luo En.

14
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,080
Anything?

15
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,680
You lot are being way too loud.

16
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,680
What now?

17
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:16,120
The young master
of the Chamber's come to play hero?

18
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,159
Whoa, no.

19
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:18,680
I just want some peace and quiet.

20
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,479
One clean strike,

21
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,560
quick and tidy.

22
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,439
No screaming and yelling.

23
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:30,120
It's annoying.

24
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:34,960
What now?

25
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,560
Scared?

26
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,520
Scare?

27
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,080
You pretty boy trying to set me up?

28
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:47,919
In front of all these people,

29
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:49,360
if I kill the young master of Qian Gang,

30
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,200
I'm basically
declaring war on the whole gang.

31
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:52,879
That's a deal I'm not taking.

32
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,080
Du Shisan's in jail.

33
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,599
Now Second Master, Zhu Que's injured,

34
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,360
and Third Master, Xuanwu's gone missing.

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,240
With your skills,

36
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:05,759
what are you so afraid of?

37
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,240
And the Seventh Master.

38
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:17,120
If you kill me,

39
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:19,039
he'll release
the Seventh Master to avenge me.

40
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,639
You'll both be badly wounded,

41
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,080
and he'll get to reap the rewards.

42
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,240
That's his game.

43
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,800
The Seventh Chief

44
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,080
is already in my hands.

45
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,759
You captured him?

46
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,159
Don't try to fool me.

47
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:37,879
Unless you kill that Seventh Master

48
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:39,520
right in front of me

49
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:40,960
with your own hands.

50
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:50,220
(Two days left.
Thirteen people remaining)

51
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:54,519
Qi.

52
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,240
Luo Jie.

53
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:57,639
Go on.

54
00:04:58,839 --> 00:04:59,279
Luo Jie.

55
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:05,600
Let's do this together.

56
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,879
You kill her,

57
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:07,879
I'll kill him.

58
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:11,120
How about it?

59
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:19,800
Alright.

60
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:42,000
Your acting's terrible.

61
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,839
Master Xuanwu.

62
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:44,759
You saw through it.

63
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:03,639
These are all the Qian Gang members
who came this time?

64
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,360
Everyone, be careful.

65
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:17,480
There's gunpowder here.

66
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:27,120
So many people to keep you company.

67
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,759
How lucky you are.

68
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:33,160
If you light that fuse,

69
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:33,920
you'll die too.

70
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:34,839
Unless

71
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:36,519
you want to go down with us?

72
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,199
Me?

73
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,360
(How did I end up in his hands?)

74
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:49,759
Why on earth would I die with you?

75
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:07,759
Faster.

76
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,120
Run!

77
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:28,360
Old Turtle!

78
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,279
Hurry and run!

79
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:33,160
There's no time!

80
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:33,920
Go, now!

81
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,959
- Go!
- Get moving!

82
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:35,920
Go!

83
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,199
Old Turtle!

84
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:40,199
Run!

85
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,360
Go, now!

86
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:44,439
Old Turtle!

87
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,040
Go!

88
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:50,680
That guy who got on the train

89
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,399
has been asleep the whole time.

90
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,439
Maybe

91
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:55,959
he's actually a turtle.

92
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,120
I knew you'd come find me.

93
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:01,600
You're the turtle Qi called, aren't you?

94
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,600
A pretty powerful turtle.

95
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,879
The Third Master of Qian Gang,

96
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,680
the best master of disguise,

97
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,439
Xuanwu.

98
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,680
Third Master, Xuanwu.

99
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,220
At your service, Young Master.

100
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:13,180
What are you staring at?

101
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:17,799
Boss Du has finally gotten to see you.

102
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,600
You believe all that nonsense too?

103
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,600
I've believed it for half my life.

104
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:24,519
What can I do?

105
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,710
Might as well keep believing.

106
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,480
But you

107
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,440
are not exactly reliable.

108
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:30,799
Hey.

109
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,320
Reliable or not,

110
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:34,000
that's not for you to decide.

111
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:56,320
Old Turtle!

112
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,200
Hurry, go!

113
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:58,879
Move!

114
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:00,600
Get out of here!

115
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,039
I don't get it.

116
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,039
Of course you don't.

117
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,080
Why him?

118
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:21,159
He and I

119
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,720
barely even know each other.

120
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,799
Just because of some dumb words,

121
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,120
because twenty-four years ago,

122
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,559
Du Shisan heard Xu Huai's Word

123
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,039
say I'd save Qian Gang?

124
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:29,399
