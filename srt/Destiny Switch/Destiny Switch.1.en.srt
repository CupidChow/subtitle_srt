known as the Intent World Metarealm,)

(people live in a state
of transcendent joy and peace.)

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,919
(Through sheer will alone,)

00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:15,919
(they manifest various meta-artefacts.)

they release intent power.)

Intent-to-Form.)

of the meta-artefact's energy,)

from level P1 to P10.)

9
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:29,879
(The ultimate form
of a meta-artefact is human embodiment,)

00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,000
(but even at its peak,)

the limitations of physical form.)

13
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,560
(a supreme force that does not
rely on external artefacts,)

the highest tier of intent power,)

(time freeze.)

21
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,640
(Just as he was entering
his ultimate training phase,)

22
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,679
(a strange burst of energy)

23
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,159

Bark again.

Woof.

00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,719

- Good dog.

00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:32,640
Good dog.

Come on, Lang.

35
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:39,239
Give it another lick.

36
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:44,159
Hey, he's really licking it.

37
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:45,519
Good.

38
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,239
Good dog.

39
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,319
Good dog, yeah.

40
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:50,760
Keep licking.

41
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,560
Hurry up.

42
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:53,640
I'm a good dog, right?

43
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,359
Please just lend me a bit more money.

44
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:57,280
This time I swear I'll win it back.

45
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,319
I'll do anything.

46
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:00,239
I'm begging you, lend me more money.

47
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:01,400
Please, I'm begging you.

48
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,560
I'll do whatever you want.

49
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,959
Anything at all.

50
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,200
I'm begging you.

51
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,439
Fine. Fine then.

52
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,240
Light it up.

53
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:31,360
Hey.

54
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,240
Okay.

55
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,800
Don't tremble.

56
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:48,800
Oh...

57
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,639
Okay.

58
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:57,039
Don't go too far.

59
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:58,960
Right.

60
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:00,199
We're all good friends.

61
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:02,639
Just friends messing about.

62
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:03,960
Mm.

63
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,199
Go.

64
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:14,879
Don't be afraid.

65
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,479
I'll protect you.

66
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,680
This scene's getting good.

67
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,840
His time is almost up

68
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,319
for him to die.

69
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:36,800
You got lucky.

70
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:37,800
I'll give

71
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,919
this money to you.

72
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:40,159
Fine.

73
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,039
Come on.

74
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,360
Come get it.

75
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,319
Take it.

76
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,120
Die.

77
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:32,759
What...

78
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:33,680
What just happened?

79
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,319
He's dead.

80
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:37,510
We crushed him to death, right?

81
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,040
Let's go, go.

82
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:40,759
Go.

83
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:41,560
What bad luck.

84
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:11,800
Delicious.

85
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,600
Really delicious.

86
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,879
Not bad.

87
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:23,920
Boss.

88
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:24,930
This is really tasty.

89
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,560
Is this

90
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,160
called noodles?

91
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,720
Aiya.

92
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:27,920
You've eaten enough.

93
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,759
Time to go.

94
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,240
Huh?

95
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:30,480
Other customers are here.

96
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,519
Not enough tables.

97
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,439
It's fine.

98
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,399
We can sit together.

99
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:35,199
They're from Qian Gang.

100
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,639
Qian Gang?

101
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,360
You must be from out of town.

102
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:41,199
They're not to be messed with.

103
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,780
Don't you know how to run a business?

104
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,320
Didn't you see our boss just walked in?

105
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:45,319
Tell that wretch to

106
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:45,959
get lost.

107
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:47,519
I haven't finished eating.

108
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,360
Heh.

109
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,959
Haven't finished?

110
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:51,199
Then eat it at home...

111
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:55,399
Boss...

112
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,839
Let's go.

113
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:58,600
Ah.

114
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:00,639
Go.

115
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:02,560
We...

116
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:02,959
Ah...

117
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:03,720
Go?

118
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,279
Yes, yes.

119
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:05,879
Useless piece of trash.

120
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,480
In Fengxi City,

121
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,600
is there anyone I, Shepi, can't offend?

122
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,800
Don't mess with him, boss.

123
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,319
Tch.

124
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,279
This seat is mine.

125
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,399
Get lost now.

126
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:18,000
Why so fierce?

127
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:18,879
Heh.

128
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,360
We can share the table.

129
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,319
Ghost.

130
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,360
Ghost...

131
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:30,959
Ghost...

132
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,560
Sit.

133
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,279
Didn't you insist just now?

134
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:36,360
Why not sit now?

135
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:37,959
Ghost.

136
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,710
There's a ghost...

137
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,920
You saw I died, didn't you?

138
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,040
Sorry.

139
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,160
I just wanted to ask,

140
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,240
how did I die?

141
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,240
Stay back!

142
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:48,160
Don't be afraid.

143
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,800
I'm actually very friendly.

144
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,800
Get him!

145
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,399
(These people)

146
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,480
(really aren't friendly.)

147
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:07,720
(Looks like I'll have
to teach them a lesson.)

148
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,240
Don't be so hot-tempered.

149
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:21,720
Here.

150
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:22,690
Have some tea.

151
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,240
Drink tea.

152
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:27,160
Hey.

153
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,560
I just want to ask,

154
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,439
how did I die?

155
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:30,720
I'll talk.

156
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,319
I'll tell you.

157
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:32,439
Let me think.

158
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:33,519
I...

159
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,680
I saw you, you...

160
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,240
Ah!

161
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:35,959
I...

162
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:36,800
I remember now!

163
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:37,920
Yes...

164
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,079
That's what happened.

165
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,279
(Good thing the meta-artefact
can freeze nearby space-time.)

166
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,560
(How did I end up here?)

167
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,319
(Only by dying under the Blood Moon)

168
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,399
(can one trigger the passage.)

169
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:16,079
(If killing me)

170
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,120
(was meant to bring me to this world,)

171
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:20,439
(then the one who killed me)

172
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,279
(wasn't this guy.)

173
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,610
Where is he?

174
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,639
Where did he go?

175
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,080
Ghost!

176
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:51,900
(Reward for information)

177
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,879
(I must find
the Gatekeeper of Time and Space)

178
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,000
(to return to the Metarealm.)

179
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,360
Where is the Gatekeeper?

180
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,399
My meta-artefact is top-tier.

181
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:15,120
Surely I can sense something.

182
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,320
Why haven't they come to get me yet?

183
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:31,540
(Reward for information)

184
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:33,879
You know who I am?

185
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,679
Freak.

186
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:43,120
Hey!

187
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,879
I don't even know what I look like now.

188
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,000
Don't tell me I'm not handsome anymore.

189
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,679
Have you seen this person?

190
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:52,799
Freak.

191
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:57,559
So rude.

192
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:58,960
Right.

193
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,559
