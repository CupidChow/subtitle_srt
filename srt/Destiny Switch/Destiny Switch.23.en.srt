(Desperate Counterattack)

3
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:24,200
You must protect him.

4
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,480
Protect him.

5
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,879
He must stay alive.

6
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:28,599
He must stay alive

7
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:30,159
to fulfill my grand plan.

8
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,840
It's been a while.

9
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:50,760
Stop now.

10
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:54,400
Whatever it is you're all doing...

11
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,519
Still,

12
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,439
don't let it come at the cost of lives.

13
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,400
Why are you starting
to sound just like Luo Jie?

14
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,519
So ungrateful.

15
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,599
But even so,

16
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,120
though I work for Mr. Xu Huai,

17
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:08,719
I still feel bad for Luo Jie.

18
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,439
He insists on going up
against Mr. Xu Huai no matter what.

19
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:13,840
And in the end,

20
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,240
he'll only wind up dead.

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,280
Don't you want to save him?

22
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,800
Let me

23
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,159
tell you a way
you can bring him back to life.

24
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:51,660
(Loyalty for the Ages)

25
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:03,159
Dad.

26
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:03,680
Oh?

27
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,680
Qi.

28
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,039
Come on.

29
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,840
Sit and chat with dad.

30
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:12,319
I finally talked Zhu Que

31
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,400
into a duel.

32
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:16,680
Just keep me company tonight,

33
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:17,840
can't you?

34
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,759
Tomorrow, okay?

35
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,080
Tonight I have
to beat that dumb Zhu Que.

36
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:23,639
I need him to see
who's really number one in Qian Gang.

37
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:25,639
Qi...

38
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:26,840
Come on.

39
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,120
Tomorrow, Dad.

40
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:29,510
I'll keep you company
every day after that.

41
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,190
I'm heading out.

42
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,759
That Luo Jie...

43
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:34,840
What about him?

44
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,319
The moment I mention his name,

45
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:38,039
you suddenly don't want to leave, huh?

46
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,400
You

47
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:43,319
grew up surrounded by boys.

48
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,320
Roughhousing with them every day,
always trying to be number one.

49
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,319
Covered in dirt all the time.

50
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,400
And I wonder

51
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:52,000
when she finally gets married...

52
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,520
What kind of woman she'll become.

53
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:00,520
So what do you think of the guy

54
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,520
I picked for you?

55
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:02,919
Him?

56
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,879
His martial arts
work sometimes and not others.

57
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,960
Looks pretty weak.

58
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,719
But sometimes strong out of nowhere.

59
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:11,240
But...

60
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:12,439
But what?

61
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,879
When I see him being picked on,

62
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,279
when I see him feeling down...

63
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,959
I get this ache in my heart.

64
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,120
It's a weird feeling.

65
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,240
So

66
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,439
you don't want to see him sad either, do you?

67
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,519
I won't let him be sad.

68
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,360
Looks like

69
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,279
he really is a good one.

70
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:36,040
Such a good man...

71
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:38,240
Why does he have to die?

72
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,759
Why?

73
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,920
Die?

74
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,399
Why would he die?

75
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:51,160
Dad.

76
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,759
What's wrong?

77
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,160
Is there something bothering you?

78
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,480
It's nothing to worry about.

79
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,360
I've already

80
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,600
come up with a solution.

81
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:21,079
Master Shisan,

82
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:23,199
your face is ready.

83
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,680
Mm.

84
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,720
I've been waiting a long time for you.

85
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,639
There's something

86
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:56,600
I still don't understand.

87
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:57,720
Speak.

88
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,180
Killing the one I love

89
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,240
can help me break through
the limits of intent power.

90
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,879
But what happens after I break through?

91
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,480
If you want the answer,

92
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,879
then come

93
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:09,160
in front of me.

94
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,639
This is my choice.

95
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,800
You must

96
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,160
stay alive.

97
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:15,000
He died for you.

98
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,439
To stop you
from going against Mr. Xu Huai.

99
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,160
He died for you.

100
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,279
Ye Sijia also died for you.

101
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,680
Luo Sifu also died for you.

102
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:29,879
And they will all die.

103
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:31,639
Qi,

104
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:33,040
Zhu Que...

105
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,720
They'll all die for you, one by one,

106
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,639
until you break through
the limits of your intent power,

107
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,439
until you can fulfill
Mr. Xu Huai's lifelong wish.

108
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,759
You've miscalculated.

109
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:46,839
If I die,

110
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,399
all your schemes will be for nothing.

111
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,439
Mr. Xu Huai is waiting for you
at the Golden Tower.

112
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:13,480
Should I call you a fool,

113
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,920
or clever?

114
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:16,879
You should ask yourself that.

115
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,680
You went through all that trouble
to raise my intent power.

116
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,759
So tell me,

117
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,600
what kind of game

118
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:25,439
are you using me to play?

119
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:27,160
Right now

120
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:28,839
is not the time to answer that.

121
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:31,279
Too bad.

122
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,159
Because right now

123
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,440
is the time you die.

124
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,279
Since ancient times,

125
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:42,360
humans have always fought against fate.

126
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,580
And they've always used just one method.

127
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:45,639
Jingwei fills the sea,

128
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:46,540
Yugong moves mountains.

129
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,900
Even if you're
a hundred times stronger than me,

130
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:49,759
your intent power

131
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,919
will run out one day.

132
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:11,879
Mm.

133
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,080
Good.

134
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:14,879
You've gotten

135
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,240
much stronger.

136
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:19,600
But taking you down

137
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:21,399
is still a piece of cake.

138
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,159
Looks like you're running out of steam.

139
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,399
Hmph.

140
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:01,360
What's wrong?

141
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:02,759
