(The Truth Revealed)

3
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:00,560
You've all learned
the secret of the tea.

4
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:01,799
And you've drunk the antidote.

5
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,359
So by noon tomorrow,

6
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,200
everyone will fall into a deep sleep.

7
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,000
But Mr. Xu Huai

8
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,200
hopes to choose the fated one

9
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,680
before noon tomorrow.

10
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,040
So he entrusted me

11
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:20,879
to leave behind a riddle.

12
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:23,319
This riddle has three questions.

13
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:27,319
You got back just in time.

14
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:28,760
Come on.

15
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,200
First.

16
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,239
Why are pigs considered dumb?

17
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:35,719
Second.

18
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:37,879
Why are humans considered smart?

19
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:42,799
The first question.

20
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:43,599
Why

21
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,400
are pigs considered dumb?

22
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,120
Second question.

23
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:50,280
Why

24
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,319
are humans considered smart?

25
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,200
Ah?

26
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,280
Third question.

27
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,599
How do pigs

28
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,239
become

29
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,400
human?

30
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,239
How do pigs become human?

31
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,000
Third.

32
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:05,519
How do pigs

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,879
become human?

34
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,080
That's the end of the riddle.

35
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,360
If you know the answers,

36
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,800
then tomorrow

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,520
come to me with them.

38
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,560
Why are pigs considered dumb?

39
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,479
What, you want to kill her again?

40
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,360
I'm not trying to kill her.

41
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,350
She's trying to hurt you.

42
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:44,039
Do you have feelings for Luo?

43
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,840
Is that why you hate me?

44
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:49,159
But

45
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:50,800
I didn't have a choice.

46
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,360
That's why I begged Luo to save me.

47
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:55,520
I didn't stick to him on purpose.

48
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,039
Can you say

49
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:03,520
you don't like Luo even a little?

50
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,390
That you've never felt anything for him?

51
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,840
You're talking nonsense.

52
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:28,439
That woman is no good.

53
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:29,719
Believe it or not,

54
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:30,560
it's up to you.

55
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,360
Whether you live or die

56
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:37,400
has nothing to do with me.

57
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:41,719
Hah.

58
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:42,840
Yeah.

59
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,479
For Inspector Ye,

60
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,560
of course I'm no good.

61
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,560
Because

62
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:54,759
I've fallen for you too.

63
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,919
Why are humans smart?

64
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,759
Why are pigs dumb?

65
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,480
You've been thinking.

66
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:18,920
Who are you?

67
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,399
You've kept wondering.

68
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:23,879
Why have you made it here step by step?

69
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:26,319
Do you also feel

70
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:29,360
like some force
has been guiding you here?

71
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,920
That mysterious force

72
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,319
killed Luo Sifu

73
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:34,920
and trapped you here.

74
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:37,439
That same mysterious force

75
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:39,680
made the leader
of Qian Gang firmly believe

76
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,079
in the prophecy
that you would save them.

77
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,319
And on this mountain,

78
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,480
you started to sense intent power

79
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,480
and step by step,
climbed all the way here.

80
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,360
But why?

81
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,959
Why?

82
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,000
What is this force

83
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,800
really trying to achieve?

84
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,759
Who are you?

85
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,319
It's you.

86
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,879
You did all of this.

87
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:18,399
Who are you?

88
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:19,319
Who is it?

89
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:34,480
We don't want to be carried down
the mountain unconscious,

90
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:36,839
so we're heading down early.

91
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,260
You were sleeping like a log just now.

92
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:40,959
You looked really pale.

93
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,560
He was worried about you,

94
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:47,759
so he waited for you to wake up.

95
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm fine.

96
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:51,959
That riddle about the pig,
I've figured it out.

97
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:53,560
What is it?

98
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:56,439
We're all that pig,

99
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:58,680
so dumb we're being controlled.

100
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:00,040
Huh?

101
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,000
Then who's the human?

102
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,279
We'll find out soon enough.

103
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,780
(Zero day left. Group of six)

104
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:18,519
The hour has come.

105
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,040
Does anyone have the answers

106
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,120
to the three questions?

107
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,639
I do.

108
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,439
And your answer is?

109
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,319
The answer doesn't matter.

110
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,639
What matters is that in one hour,

111
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,720
everyone who didn't drink
the tea will fall asleep

112
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,360
except me.

113
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,319
Because I have intent power in me.

114
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,040
This was a setup
by Xu Huai Long just for me.

115
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:50,800
Lead the way.

116
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:52,519
Congratulations.

117
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,320
Luo Jie of Qian Gang got it right.

118
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:55,199
Hold on.

119
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:59,199
Young Master Luo En, you object?

120
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,720
I don't care about seeing Xu Huai Long.

121
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,040
What I care about

122
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,879
is that a murderer

123
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,600
is walking free

124
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,120
right in front of the Chief Inspector.

125
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:12,279
Inspector Ye.

126
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,370
I want to report him.

127
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,120
He killed my father, Luo Sifu.
I saw it with my own eyes.

128
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,879
I can testify.

129
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,399
Why is Inspector Ye hesitating?

130
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,800
This is a murder case!

131
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,319
Inspector Ye.

132
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,040
You wear that police uniform

133
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,000
to uphold peace and order,

134
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,879
to protect the people.

135
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,040
And now you're going
to cover for a murderer?

136
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:59,360
Since the victim has filed a report,

137
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,439
I'll follow legal procedure

138
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,600
and take the suspect in for questioning.

139
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,199
Do you believe

140
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,000
what you saw is not the truth?

141
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,320
The one who pulled the trigger

142
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,120
isn't necessarily the killer.

143
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,759
(She's been
radiating intense intent power.)

144
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:55,279
In the Metarealm,

145
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,720
intent power can shape
not only things but people.

146
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,840
(She was actually a meta-artefact
formed from intent power.)

147
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:04,200
(As long as she's nearby,)

148
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:07,000
(I can use intent power
to control time.)

149
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,919
That officer just now

150
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:20,399
said I'm a bad person.

151
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,200
Do you believe her?

152
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,480
I'm not a bad person.

153
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm just a pitiful one.

154
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:35,879
If she misunderstood you,

155
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,279
then tomorrow,

156
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:39,120
could you do me a favor?

157
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:41,120
