(The Secret of Mount Huai'en)

3
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:48,519
Look at you.

4
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:50,280
Without my protection,

5
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,680
you got beaten up, didn't you?

6
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,760
Seems like
I still need Qi to protect me.

7
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:56,719
After all, Qi's that strong.

8
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,120
Mm.

9
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,879
This trip

10
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:11,439
is going to be interesting.

11
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,380
(Five days remaining)

12
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,420
(Total eighteen people)

13
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,000
We've arrived at Mount Huai'en.

14
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:37,919
We're here.

15
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:38,960
Finally made it.

16
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:43,360
Come on, Qi.

17
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,000
We've arrived.

18
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,719
Mm.

19
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:52,639
That guy got on the train

20
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,560
and slept the whole way.

21
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,159
Maybe

22
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:00,159
he's actually a tortoise.

23
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,479
I've been waiting for you all.

24
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,240
(Mount Huai'en Attendant)
Please hand over your weapons.

25
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,120
(Mount Huai'en Attendant)
Then you may proceed up the mountain.

26
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,560
I have none.

27
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,280
What do you mean?

28
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,820
It's a mutual understanding
with the mountain attendants.

29
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,199
No taking lives.

30
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,700
Mount Huai'en is where
the master resides in seclusion.

31
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,680
He is waiting for you up there.

32
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,360
You may rest first
at the inn on the mountain.

33
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:44,240
It's just a stopover?

34
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:45,719
The master said,

35
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:47,480
conditions on the mountain are rough.

36
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,500
Guest rooms are limited.

37
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,560
If you wish for comfort,

38
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,879
the return train

39
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,520
is ready to depart at any time.

40
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:55,960
We came here precisely
to be uncomfortable.

41
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:28,600
Why is the mist
on this mountain so thick?

42
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,279
This is too strange.

43
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:42,199
Let's go.

44
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,120
Just leave it in the inn's storeroom.

45
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,480
Do you need a coffin?

46
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,079
Not at the moment.

47
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,319
That'll do for now.

48
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:10,319
Everyone,

49
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:12,279
from what I see, the road up

50
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:14,000
is even harder than the one down.

51
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,959
If any of you intend

52
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:17,720
to turn back now,

53
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,160
our trade guild is willing to offer

54
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,000
a portion of funds as travel expenses,

55
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,839
just a small token of goodwill.

56
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:23,279
Ah.

57
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,040
Since we're all here,

58
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,639
it proves everyone has desires.

59
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:33,680
Some people can stop acting

60
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,399
like they're all righteous and noble.

61
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,920
Who's really above anyone else?

62
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,000
We're here to get Xu Huai's Word,

63
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,490
so we can get our father out of prison.

64
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,759
Is Xu Huai's Word really that powerful?

65
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:44,560
Can it solve anything?

66
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:45,759
We'll know soon enough.

67
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:03,800
This journey won't be easy.

68
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,839
Over twenty years ago, the boss said

69
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,660
there would be fewer
and fewer people on this mountain.

70
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,640
Every day, the mountain attendants
carry someone down.

71
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,400
No one's ever made it
past the fourth day.

72
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,580
Thanks for the warning.

73
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,600
I was talking to Qi,

74
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:17,199
not you.

75
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:07,519
Everyone,

76
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:08,839
night's about to fall.

77
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:10,839
Make sure you check in at the Tower Inn.

78
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:12,439
Have some hot tea.

79
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,519
Mount Huai'en
has an agreement with the police.

80
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:42,800
As long as no one dies up here,

81
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:45,100
what happens on the mountain
stays on the mountain.

82
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,600
The police have no jurisdiction.

83
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,000
But when people in the underworld fight,

84
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,079
who knows their limits?

85
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,079
Don't you think so, Inspector Ye?

86
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,600
So, Master White Tiger,

87
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,000
what you're saying is, you're willing
to kill over Xu Huai's Word?

88
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,839
And you think I'm in your way, right?

89
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,279
Inspector Ye, you're so perceptive.

90
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:11,279
Then I'll say no more.

91
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,480
Right here in this scenic,
peaceful place,

92
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,600
I'll send you

93
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,680
on your way.

94
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:20,480
We all handed in our weapons.

95
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,410
Why does she have a gun?

96
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,700
I'm tasked with making sure
no one dies on this mountain.

97
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,399
Of course I came prepared.

98
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,240
After her!

99
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,519
Run.

100
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:49,850
This is too strange.

101
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,200
Why is it snowing in this forest?

102
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:51,799
Run!

103
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:52,679
They're catching up!

104
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:06,159
You...

105
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:06,900
What are you doing?

106
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,080
You...

107
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:26,919
What are you doing?

108
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:32,799
So...

109
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:36,480
