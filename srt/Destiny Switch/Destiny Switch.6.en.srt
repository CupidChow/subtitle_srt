(Finding the Real Killer)

3
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:17,400
If I die,

4
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,319
the Gate of Time and Space
will never open.

5
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:24,359
You weren't the one
who fired that shot just now.

6
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:25,319
The killer

7
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:28,079
wants you to stay here.

8
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,599
I've been watching you.

9
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,560
You came out of the house

10
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,079
and sat there for ages.

11
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:57,480
Where did that gun come from?

12
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,519
I've been thinking...

13
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:04,359
Why?

14
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:08,599
Why exactly?

15
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,560
I don't understand.

16
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:12,719
Ah...

17
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:17,240
There's something

18
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:17,960
really odd.

19
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:21,360
The original owner
of this body was called Lang.

20
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,840
My friend Luo Sifu said

21
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,199
he was a total loser.

22
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,439
So then,

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,719
why would Du Shisan
give Qian Gang to someone like that?

24
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:36,719
Unless he knew

25
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,039
that the spirit core in this body

26
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,479
had already been swapped out.

27
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:42,960
Ah?

28
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:44,879
Don't you think so?

29
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,000
I've no idea what you're saying.

30
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:54,319
Tonight,

31
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:57,039
I'm helping a friend with something.

32
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:58,520
You don't need to follow me.

33
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,599
Is it something dangerous?

34
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:06,800
It's for a friend,

35
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,240
something that must be done.

36
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,120
You're not taking me?

37
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,479
You're weak.

38
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:13,600
You're always following me.

39
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:18,080
It's annoying.

40
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,400
(Du Shisan,)

41
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,599
(is it you?)

42
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,479
(Was everything behind this)

43
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,800
(all your doing?)

44
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,319
You heard right.

45
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:52,680
They're going to the Luo family

46
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:55,039
to fetch the young master.

47
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:55,580
That's right.

48
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,000
The Master and Second Master
went to receive him.

49
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,400
Hmph.

50
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,840
Good things never
come our Fourth Hall's way.

51
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,080
Quick.

52
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:06,000
Let's go flatter the new master
before Second Master gets there.

53
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,520
Once he's in charge of Qian Gang,

54
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,560
we'll be rising
through the ranks for sure.

55
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:10,560
But,

56
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:13,240
we still don't know
who this new young master even is.

57
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,199
Bloody hell.

58
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,040
What rotten luck.

59
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:26,560
That's Qian Gang's
headquarters up ahead.

60
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:28,279
Du Shisan's in there, right?

61
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:29,519
You know it.

62
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,120
So get lost.

63
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,639
Oof.

64
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,079
I knew it.

65
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:42,399
No way someone like you
got stronger overnight.

66
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:44,319
Just look at you,

67
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,279
still the same mutt I used to own.

68
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,560
Oh?

69
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:50,639
So he's the one you were talking about,

70
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,600
that mutt?

71
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,439
Yeah.

72
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,519
I'd suggest

73
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,160
you not speak like that.

74
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,399
Trying to scare me again?

75
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,120
I'm telling you, I don't care how strong
you got all of a sudden.

76
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,800
I'm not afraid.

77
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:08,519
Can you even take on all these lads?

78
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:09,079
And

79
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:10,560
that guy.

80
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,000
His name alone

81
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,399
will scare the life out of you.

82
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,399
Second Master of Qian Gang,

83
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:18,240
Fengxi's top fighter,

84
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,120
Zhuque.

85
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:20,800
One shot takes five lives,

86
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,879
one palm shatters a skull.

87
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:25,600
He could crush you
like he's crushing an ant.

88
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,639
Prepare to die!

89
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:30,839
Ah!

90
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:31,560
Ow!

91
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:34,639
Who's there?

92
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,199
Second Master.

93
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,160
Did you miss your shot?

94
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,490
He can take five lives in one shot.

95
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:44,439
You really think he'd miss?

96
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,079
Welcome home, Young Master.

97
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:52,319
Young Master.

98
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,420
- Welcome home, Young Master.
- Welcome home, Young Master.

99
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:55,120
Kneel, now!

100
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:56,160
Young...

101
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:56,839
Young Master?

102
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:02,480
Young Master.

103
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,480
Spare me, please!

104
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Spare my life.

105
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:06,759
I...

106
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:07,920
I'm just a dog!

107
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:09,560
Woof...

108
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,480
Woof...

109
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:12,759
Woof...

110
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:13,360
Woof...

111
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:13,800
Woof...

112
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,639
Spare my life.

113
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:17,839
Today...

114
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:20,600
Today's the great day
you've returned to the gang.

115
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,639
We're all family, right?

116
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,839
Humans and dogs...

117
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,079
How could they be family?

118
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:26,839
Right!

119
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,160
You're the master.

120
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:29,319
I'm the dog!

121
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:31,759
Woof!

122
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,360
Woof!

123
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,680
Let's go.

124
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:46,639
To meet Boss Du?

125
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,319
Right.

126
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:48,920
He's waiting for you.

127
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:51,839
Is he alone?

128
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,079
Mm.

129
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,240
He prefers peace and quiet.

130
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,879
Boss is in the car.

131
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,800
Wait.

132
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,319
What we're about to say

133
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,000
isn't for your ears.

134
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:26,639

00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,639
