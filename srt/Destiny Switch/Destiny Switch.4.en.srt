Just Jianghu business.

Please get in the car.

13
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,759
Don't touch my husband.

14
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,400
Guest in the car,

15
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,190
aren't you coming out
for a bowl of wontons?

16
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,159
Please get out of the car.

(The Wealthiest
in Fengxi City, Luo Sifu)

18
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:20,560
One bowl of wontons.

19

Luo Jie.

20
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:11,719
I want him.

21
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,520
Boss Luo.

22
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,720
Aren't you full of yourself?

23
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,720
You're late.

24
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:10,959
Only one

bowl of wonton left.

26
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,000
Boss Luo,

27
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,040
how do we split this bowl

28
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,959
of wontons?

29
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,399
Well,

30
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:23,040
I'm getting old.

31
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,360
How about

32
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:28,439
letting me have it?

33
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,240
I've got

34
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,439
a lot of men under me.

35
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:50,920
They all need

36
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,800
some soup to live on.

37
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,639
Your men

38
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,160
can't even get in the door.

39
00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:00,600
Why save the soup for them?

40
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,000
In a little while,

41
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:23,360
they'll be inside.

42
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,920
Then, Master Shisan...

43
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:28,120
Even this wonton

44
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:30,399
won't be yours anymore.

45
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:34,800
Hey.

46
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,890
You'd better stop fighting.

47
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,560
We're starving.

48
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:38,560
Give

49
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:39,959
this bowl to us.

50
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,360
Hmm.

51
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,800
Son.

52
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,639
I'm your father.

53
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,600
You're the wealthiest in Fengxi City,

54
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,399
Luo Sifu?

55
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:08,680
Ugh.

56
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:09,920
What a pain.

57
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,920
The Qian Gang's boss

58
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,839
and the city's richest man both want me.

59
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:16,920
But the Qian Gang boss
is really sincere.

60
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:18,920
And you?

61
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,290
What can you offer me?

62
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,959
I

63
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:26,920
can

64
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,839
give you

65
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:30,560
lots and lots of

66
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:34,879
fatherly love.

67
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,120
Ha.

68
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,120
You really haven't changed in ten years.

69
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,480
Still the same stingy old merchant.

70
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:58,040
Looks like

71
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,079
the wonton stall that Master Shisan
has looked after all these years

72
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,279
is now

73
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,120
beyond his protection.

74
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,360
From now on,

75
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,279
this street's shops

76
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,759
don't bother looking after them anymore.

77
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:11,879
What do you say?

78
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:21,399
Hmm.

79
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,000
Son.

80
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:24,839
Let's go.

81
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:34,919
Wait.

82
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:36,720
Qi,

83
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,759
you're his wife.

84
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,120
You should go back
to the Luo family with him.

85
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,000
Dad.

86
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:45,159
Listen to me.

87
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,000
You need to take good care
of your husband.

88
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:51,559
He'll face dangers far worse than today.

89
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,480
But his life

90
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,639
is more important than yours, or mine.

91
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:55,279
Got it?

92
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:56,799
Go on.

93
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,840
Look after your husband well, alright?

94
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:27,559
How strange.

95
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:29,399
Why won't it let me hear?

96
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:32,559
Tell me,

97
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:35,200
who exactly are you to me?

98
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,960
Big bro.

99
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,600
I missed you so much.

100
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:43,320
How dare you make me call you Dad!

101
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,519
