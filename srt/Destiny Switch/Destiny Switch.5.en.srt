(I Actually Became the Murderer)

3
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,280
You're just a measly P5,

4
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,560
and you dare make me call you Dad?

5
00:00:59,079 --> 00:00:59,640
Big bro.

6
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:00,719
I was wrong.

7
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:03,399
You dare make your big bro call you Dad?

8
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:04,200
Ah?

9
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,319
Call you Dad!

10
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:05,599
Ow!

11
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:06,120
Call you Dad!

12
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:07,000
Call you Dad!

13
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,319
I won't! I won't call you Dad!

14
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,280
Say it!

15
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,280
Call you Dad!

16
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:11,040
Say it!

17
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:12,599
Ow...

18
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,719
Oh, right.

19
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:30,319
Right, big bro.

20
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,719
(Gatekeeper of Time and Space: Luo Sifu)
I remember you used Intent-to-Form to make a watch.

21
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,920
Where's that watch?

22
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,040
Lost it.

23
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:36,760
Lost it?

24
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:39,680
Tell me this.

25
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,200
Why can intent power
only form meta-artefacts?

26
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,079
Why can't it be turned into energy
we can use ourselves?

27
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,000
That would be
the legendary Intent-to-Ether.

28
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:52,120
Gaining world-shattering power

29
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:54,920
without relying on any external object.

30
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:56,760
But,

31
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,760
it's only a legend.

32
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,319
No one has ever achieved it.

33
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:03,239
World-shattering power...

34
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:05,200
If someone really could do that,

35
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:06,680
that would be terrifying.

36
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,359
Come on.

37
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:08,919
Forget about destroying the world.

38
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:10,319
Think about yourself first.

39
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,039
Either the killer

40
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:14,759
ran into the Blood Moon

41
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,439
while killing your original body,

42
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,520
or it was just a coincidence.

43
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:21,520
But in this world,

44
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,000
there's no such thing as coincidence.

45
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:25,120
Then their goal

46
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,039
was to make you cross over.

47
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,439
And the only ones who would know how

48
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,520
are intent wielders.

49
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:36,280
Oh, ya.

50
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:38,919
Why was the original host
who let me cross over

51
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:40,080
your illegitimate son?

52
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:41,599
Oh, big bro.

53
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:42,400
Look, it's getting late.

54
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,120
Let's head home.

55
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:43,759
Let's go.

56
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:44,520
Hey, what do you mean?

57
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,680
Say it clearly!

58
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,439
Are you trying to make me
call you Dad on purpose?

59
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,240
As if I would.

60
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:49,360
Let's go.

61
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,100
We'll talk at home.

62
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:50,639
- Oi!
- Let's go home!

63
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:51,360
Stop right there!

64
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,759
Wait for me!

65
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:02,300
(Dong Mianhua Wonton)

66
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,599
Master.

67
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,800
It was my fault.

68
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,159
Aren't you curious?

69
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,039
I knew so many people
were interested in Luo Jie,

70
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,439
but why did I

71
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,039
bring only you today?

72
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:24,639
Well...

73
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,520
We needed Luo Jie to know

74
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,000
that we meant him no harm,

75
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,319
and also that

76
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,430
it's only natural for him
to return to the Luo family.

77
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,639
That's the whole point of today's setup.

78
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:05,479
Big bro.

79
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:06,520
When you see my son later,

80
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,080
just call me Dad, yeah?

81
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,719
Otherwise I'll lose all authority
as head of the family.

82
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:10,520
You get that, right?

83
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,319
Move.

84
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:21,720
I'm a grown man, don't hold me.

85
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:26,199
Move.

86
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:27,199
Master.

87
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:28,600
It hurts so much.

88
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,639
My ear's killing me.

89
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:31,839
Dad.

90
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,680
Who did this? Who beat you like this?

91
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,360
It hurts so much.

92
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,160
I did.

93
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:39,319
Why did you bring him back?

94
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,879
He... He colluded with Qian Gang!

95
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:42,399
His woman beat me up like this!

96
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,040
Dad.

97
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,639
Well...

98
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,000
Dad.

99
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:51,670
Mom just passed away,

100
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,490
and you're already bringing home
some bastard to bully me?

101
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:55,279
Didn't you say Mum
was your one true love?

102
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:56,160
Oh dear.

103
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,399
Son.

104
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,199
Of course your mum is my one true love.

105
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:01,680
Then why did you bring him back?

106
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:03,120
In this house,

107
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:03,879
it's either me

108
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:04,759
or him.

109
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,519
Ah...

110
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,480
You're right.

111
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,360
We really can't live
under the same roof.

112
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:11,920
Then you choose, Dad.

113
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:12,800
Ah...

114
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:13,639
Son.

115
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,399
You've been at home since young,

116
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,959
never really suffered.

117
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:18,639
You're the one I treasure most.

118
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:19,240
Right?

119
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,439
But now, you've grown up.

120
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:24,040
It's time you face some hardship.

121
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,639
Honestly,

122
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,560
it won't do you any harm.

123
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:27,480
Ah?

124
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:29,959
If you're short on money, just tell me.

125
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,279
What?

126
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:32,439
Come on.

127
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:34,480
Weren't you just saying this house

128
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,720
can't have both of you?

129
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,480
Then take care of yourself out there.

130
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,600
I'm the one moving out?

131
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,279
Mm-hmm.

132
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:43,399
Huh?

133
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:43,839
Dad.

134
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,800
Shouldn't he be the one leaving? Why me?

135
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:49,319
I'm tired.

136
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:49,759
Aiya.

137
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,480
Look, your brother's exhausted.
Hurry up and go.

138
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,400
Don't disturb his rest.

139
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:53,319
Come.

140
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:53,600
Quick.

141
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,290
I can walk myself.

142
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:54,759
My leg.

143
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:55,040
Enough.

144
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,439
Leg!

145
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:55,959
Go.

146
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,959
Leg!

147
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:57,680
My leg...

148
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:58,639
Quick!

149
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,519
Wait, Dad...

150
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:00,319
Go!

151
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:00,800
No, Dad!

152
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,759
You're abandoning me?

153
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:02,160
Just go!

154
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,360
Slow down, I'll walk myself...

155
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,439
What is it?

156
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,040
You want to go out and play with him?

157
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:11,040
Mm-hmm.

158
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:12,530
Go on then.

159
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,920
(If)

160
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,720
(the person who lured me
from the Intent World)

161
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,680
(was Luo Sifu himself,)

162
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,360
(then he definitely won't open
the Gate of Time and Space)

163
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,439
(to send me back.)

164
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,360
I'm absolutely knackered.

165
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,240
Don't laugh.

166
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,490
You'll be like this too
once you've got a wife and kid.

167
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,000
Then I'd rather not have them.

168
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,920
Open the Gate of Time and Space.

169
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:09,959
I want to go back.

170
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:11,360
Going back already?

171
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,400
Don't you want to find out

172
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,120
who killed the original owner
of your body?

173
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,890
You've lived in this world
for so many years.

174
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:19,490
If there were other intent wielders

175
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,199
in this world,

176
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,519
wouldn't you know?

177
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,079
Mm.

178
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:24,839
So you came here

179
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:25,800
by accident?

180
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,560
Fine.

181
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,399
I'll send you back.

182
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,260
If there really aren't any other
intent wielders in this world,

183
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:47,040
then is it possible

184
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:49,160
that the killer

185
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,240
is you?

186
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:01,990
Go back quickly!

187
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,590
Enter the Gate of Time and Space!

188
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:05,759
Go back now!

189
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:07,920
Go back!

190
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,360
What's going on?

191
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,600
Why am I holding a gun?

192
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,480
What's happening?

193
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,120
Your spirit core.

194
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,519
How can your spirit core return?

195
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,440
Tell me! Say it now!

196
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,120
Because I

197
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:46,919
have always

198
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:48,840
wanted to stay in this world

199
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:51,279
to be with my wife and child.

200
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:53,120
I fused

201
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:54,240
my spirit core

202
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,240
with my body.

203
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,480
If I die,

204
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:01,519
the Gate of Time and Space
can never be opened again.

205
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,720
The killer

206
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,159
wants you to stay here.

207
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,200
Big bro...

208
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,559
Take care of

209
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,440
my son for me.

210
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,480
It's about time.

211
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:33,559
Take some men.

212
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:36,080
Bring the young master home.
