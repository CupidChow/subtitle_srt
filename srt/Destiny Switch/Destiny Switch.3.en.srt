=Episode 3=
(The Emergence of an Intent User)

3
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:52,759
Who is it?

4
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:05,719
Who are you?

5
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:06,959
How dare you shoot me!

6
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:08,719
Who's in there?

7
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,439
(Qian Gang's leader, Du Shisan)

8
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,000
Cold?

9
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:15,439
No.

10
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:20,120
Just a bit noisy.

11
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:22,040
My dad said

12
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:23,239
you're too noisy.

13
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,120
Your dad?

14
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:25,560
You dare hit me?

15
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:27,400
Silence.

16
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,799
It's Master Shisan!

17
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,519
The one who won
Xu Huai's Word 24 years ago.

18
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:33,319
Leader of Qian Gang!

19
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:34,120
It's Master Shisan!

20
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:36,840
(Qian Gang?)

21
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,719
(Qian Gang again.)

22
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:39,790
It really is Master Shisan!

23
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,280
Master.

24
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,480
We didn't know it was you.

25
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,480
We were wrong.

26
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,439
We were wrong.

27
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:46,319
We were wrong.

28
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:54,439
Come in.

29
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,640
Wontons are ready.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,599
Eat them while they're hot.

31
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:14,879
Don't hit me!

32
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,599
You...

33
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:16,120
Don't hit me!

34
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,660
(Dong Mianhua Wonton)

35
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:36,840
Eat.

36
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:38,879
Come on, eat.

37
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:43,759
Mhm.

38
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:44,960
Tasty.

39
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,879
It's been over twenty years.

40
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:48,319
It hasn't been easy.

41
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:49,919
Back then, the shopkeeper

42
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:52,039
just had a little pushcart,

43
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:52,840
selling them

44
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:54,000
on the street.

45
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,439
At that time,

46
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,800
I was hot-headed.

47
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,000
I offended the gang boss back then.

48
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,300
(Wonton)

49
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,400
Stop right there!

50
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,960
- Stop!
- Stop!

51
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,140
(Young Du Shisan)

52
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,039
Stop!

53
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:06,919
Stop!

54
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:09,560
Stop!

55
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,319
You again? One bowl, right?

56
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:12,520
Extra wontons, yeah?

57
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:15,719
Quick, hide!

58
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:26,400
Guess

59
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,439
who I saw.

60
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:30,319
What?

61
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,199
What's it got to do with me?

62
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,319
I haven't even introduced myself.

63
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:35,280
Me,

64
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:37,360
I just hang around the streets.

65
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,759
Friends call me Du Shisan.

66
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:40,300
In Fengxi City, north and south,

67
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,170
in South City's nine streets
and twelve alleys,

68
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,280
all kinds of shops,

69
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:44,719
over three hundred.

70
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,439
I roughly manage
one hundred and eighty-two of them.

71
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,159
Everything I just mentioned,

72
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:50,680
all the shops, they're here.

73
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,919
Come be the young master of Qian Gang.

74
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:54,879
What do you say?

75
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:56,479
(Could it be)

76
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:58,080
(him?)

77
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,199
We don't even know each other.

78
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,879
And you want to hand me
such a big operation?

79
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,919
Is it because

80
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:08,280
I've got some special talent?

81
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,280
Of course you do.

82
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:14,039
My men told me
you survived a deadly situation

83
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,759
and even dodged a bullet.

84
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,560
So that's why, huh.

85
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,680
This is my goddaughter,

86
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,759
Little Qi Tuotuo.

87
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:28,360
She's

88
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,839
very mischievous.

89
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,390
I offered her the position
of the Seventh Hall's master,

90
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:32,879
she refused.

91
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,839
Insisted on roaming the world instead.

92
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:37,120
Didn't expect her to run into you.

93
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,839
You two really are fated.

94
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,000
Hey.

95
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:47,480
That's not fate.

96
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,160
I'm marrying her to you.

97
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:50,730
What do you say?

98
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:51,839
Don't worry.

99
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,000
She'll definitely be the good wife,
loving mother type.

100
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,279
Qi!

101
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:57,920
Don't run!

102
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,399
Qi!

103
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:01,639
Qi, come back!

104
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:04,279
Qi!

105
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,279
Stop!

106
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:06,580
This is the one I told you about,

107
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,759
your husband.

108
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:18,560
What...

109
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:19,879
What are you staring at?

110
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,399
Hey!

111
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:21,360
I didn't agree to this!

112
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,399
Gently.

113
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:24,879
Gently.

114
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,000
Don't come near me!

115
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:27,879
Stop!

116
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:28,360
Don't move!

117
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,240
You're my husband,
of course I have to take a good look.

118
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:30,879
Stay back!

119
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:34,480
Stay back!

120
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,279
Aiya...

121
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:42,639
Over twenty years

122
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,519
and I've finally found you.

123
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:50,279
This world

124
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,199
has finally welcomed you too.

125
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:24,900
(Dong Mianhua Wonton)

126
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,480
Hey!

127
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,199
Ow!

128
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:40,639
Qi.

129
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,160
You must work hard to be a good wife.

130
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,560
Mhm.

131
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,639
A kiss.
