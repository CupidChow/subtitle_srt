(Intent-to-Ether)

3
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,359
You didn't hold back.

4
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,519
Shelly wants
to kill everyone close to me.

5
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,480
If I hadn't faked your death,

6
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:10,159
once Shelly made her move,

7
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:12,319
even a god might not
be able to save you.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,640
Don't worry.

9
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:17,359
I had perfect aim.

10
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:18,840
I was never going to kill you.

11
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:21,760
As long as Qi is safe.

12
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,760
Who exactly

13
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:25,959
are they trying to hurt?

14
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,079
You've already died once.

15
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:30,719
You've paid your debt.

16
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,840
What comes next

17
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,280
is up to you.

18
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:52,159
Hmph.

19
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,560
Still not good enough.

20
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,239
Let me remind you,

21
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:57,640
everyone who came here today

22
00:01:58,239 --> 00:01:59,400
did it for you.

23
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,159
You think

24
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:08,479
you held your own against him.

25
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,439
But the truth is,

26
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,840
he only used ten percent of his power.

27
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,039
It's fine.

28
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,680
Right now,

29
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,360
you can slowly start to match him.

30
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:32,280
They all died because of you.

31
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:36,680
Your rage is already boiling over.

32
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,800
Only one more person

33
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,759
and you'll fully break through.

34
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:47,919
Awaken,

35
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,719
Luo Jie.

36
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,319
No!

37
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,400
Intent-to-Ether.

38
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:10,879
So

39
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,000
Intent-to-Ether is real.

40
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,719
You just awakened it, so it's still weak.

41
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,439
Is that so?

42
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,719
This is a double-edged blade.

43
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:45,159
Advance one inch, I kill you.

44
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:46,159
Retreat one inch, I die.

45
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,000
Do you dare let me die?

46
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:22,920
Seems like

47
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:25,240
the scales are tipping in my favor.

48
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:30,439
Tell me,

49
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:31,800
do you think

50
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:33,959
human will can defy heaven?

51
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,600
It's time.

52
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,959
It's you?

53
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:55,879
Who are you?

54
00:04:59,079 --> 00:04:59,920
I'm you.

55
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,879
I am you.

56
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:04,399
The you from twenty-four years later.

57
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,319
What you need to do

58
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:08,480
is exactly what I need to do.

59
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,040
The year you came
from the Metarealm to this world

60
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:14,839
was X90.

61
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,160
All of this

62
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,720
happens five years from now.

63
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,839
A P3-ranked intent wielder named Qiersa

64
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:22,399
accidentally killed the one he loved.

65
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,639
But in doing so, he uncovered a secret.

66
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,820
In the Metarealm,
where there was only joy,

67
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,720
he felt pain
and sorrow for the first time.

68
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,319
That new feeling

69
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:33,279
greatly enhanced his intent power.

70
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:35,600
He went beyond simple Intent-to-Form

71
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,079
and did what no one had done before.

72
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:39,759
He reached Intent-to-Ether.

73
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:42,439
Qiersa seduced more and more people

74
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:43,680
into becoming his followers.

75
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:46,439
They broke their limits by killing

76
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:48,399
the ones they loved most.

77
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,199
The Metarealm

78
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:51,800
turned into a living hell.

79
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,120
Because he
reached Intent-to-Ether first,

80
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,000
he became an unrivaled king.

81
00:05:57,879 --> 00:05:59,199
To stop him,

82
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,519
to save everyone in the Metarealm,

83
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:03,360
I had to master a power

84
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,720
strong enough to rival his.

85
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,079
Then, through the Space-Time Gate,

86
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:09,199
I came to the past.

87
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,160
I must stop him
before the disaster begins.

88
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,480
All of this

89
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:15,240
was the fate I chose for you.

90
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,560
This fate is my own choice.

91
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,920
Breaking the limits,
reaching Intent-to-Ether,

92
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:25,160
it comes from losing the one you love.

93
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,759
If I want to reach the peak

94
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:29,120
to fight him,

95
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:30,639
there's only one way.

96
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:33,160
Our souls are linked.

97
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:35,720
I can make you feel

98
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,079
the greatest pain in the world,
the pain of death.

99
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,519
May my death

100
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,040
bring life

101
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,319
to my people.

102
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:11,680
I've waited so long,

103
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,000
and the day has finally come.

104
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,160
Why should I
be just a vessel for intent power?

105
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,000
Why can't I rule this world instead?

106
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:45,720
No.

107
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:48,720
I won't let her ruin everything.

108
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:21,439
Go!

109
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,879
No!

110
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,039
Hurry.

111
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,240
Go back now.

112
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:57,759
The Aurora Space-Time Gate
is about to open.

113
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,399
What has happened

114
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,519
can...

115
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,000
Can still be rewritten.

116
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,399
Don't

117
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:17,639
save her.

118
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,080
Your ether is almost depleted.

119
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,799
Are you leaving?

120
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:42,600
No.

121
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,679
I'm going

122
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,440
to bring them back.
