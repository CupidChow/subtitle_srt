(Lost Pocket Watch)

3
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,180
(Lv's Ceramic Wine Sets)
Selling people!

4
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,079
Come take a look!

5
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:11,350
(If just one person buys,)

6
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:12,560
(I'll lose money.)

7
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,439
(If ten people come,)

8
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:16,040
(I'll make triple the profit.)

9
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,359
(I need to wait for more.)

10
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:20,680
(For sale: Illegitimate son of Fengxi City's richest man)
So that's the one with the huge bounty on his head.

11
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,680
Interesting.

12
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,159
(Where am I now?)

13
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:35,280
(I'm a proper intent power user
from the Metarealm,)

14
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,280
(how did I end up
captured by some girl?)

15
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,480
I'd rather not hurt you.

16
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,560
You can't beat me.

17
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,400
Fine.

18
00:01:57,879 --> 00:01:59,519
Then I'll let you see for yourself

19
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,319
what Intent-to-Form really means.

20
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:16,240
I want his pocket watch.

21
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,000
One silver yuan.

22
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:25,719
Where's my meta-artefact?

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,420
(Let them
get a good look at the product,)

24
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:29,639
(then they'll want to buy.)

25
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:38,719
Hey.

26
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:41,199
Don't leave.

27
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:43,039
Pack up.

28
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,439
You...

29
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,479
Why isn't anyone buying?

30
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:49,360
Thirty thousand.

31
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,120
I'll pay thirty thousand.

32
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,690
Why does someone
buy the moment I take off my clothes?

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,039
Do you need it gift-wrapped?

34
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:58,960
Want home delivery?

35
00:02:59,159 --> 00:02:59,479
Eh?

36
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,000
Is it that casual?

37
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:01,840
Wait.

38
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,479
We haven't even named our price yet.

39
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,520
(Could it be)

40
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,039
(the one buying me)

41
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:26,879
(is the one who killed
the original host)

42
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:28,960
(and brought me to this world?)

43
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,159
So many people.

44
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:35,120
We're going to make so much money.

45
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,639
(Weird.)

46
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:39,000
(I don't sense any intent power)

47
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,560
(coming from these people.)

48
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,759
Thirty-two thousand.

49
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:47,800
Forty thousand.

50
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,599
Forty-five thousand.

51
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:55,680
Forty-eight thousand.

52
00:03:58,759 --> 00:03:59,680
Forty-eight thousand!

53
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,360
Heavens!

54
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,719
Are you sure?

55
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,080
Forty-eight thousand.

56
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,639
Anyone offering fifty?

57
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:06,080
Huh?

58
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:07,840
Anyone?

59
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:09,039
Huh?

60
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:10,800
Anyone else?

61
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:12,479
Anyone else?

62
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:13,960
Eh.

63
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:15,879
I guess I'm going with you.

64
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,610
How about taking off your mask,

65
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,399
let me see your face.

66
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,639
Any bids for fifty?

67
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:21,759
Any bids for fifty?

68
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:24,000
Forty-eight, going once.

69
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,639
Forty-eight, going twice.

70
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:31,120
I'll pay one hundred thousand.

71
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,720
One hundred thousand?

72
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,639
That much?

73
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,720
Great!

74
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,240
You're such a good person.

75
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,160
I'll hand him

76
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,800
over to you.

77
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:44,560
You...

78
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:48,839
Yo...

79
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:52,000
Isn't that the only son
of Fengxi's richest man?

80
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Young Master Luo En?

81
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,399
Tch.

82
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:55,079
Only son? Please.

83
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,879
The illegitimate one's been found,

84
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,439
so he's not the only one anymore.

85
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,690
Now someone else
gets a piece of the inheritance.

86
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:03,079
Disguised himself to buy him out...

87
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:06,040
Looks like
Young Master Luo En is scared.

88
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:08,360
That guy?

89
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,319
He's a bastard.

90
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,560
Tch.

91
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,319
A shameless bastard, too.

92
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:14,600
Watch your mouth.

93
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,110
Take him away.

94
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,399
Hey!

95
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:20,759
I'm not going back with you.

96
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:22,000
What if you try to kill me

97
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,680
and keep the inheritance for yourself?

98
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,160
Say one more word.

99
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:51,639
He's bleeding.

100
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:52,920
He got shot?

101
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,360
Who was it?

102
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:04,879
Who are you?

103
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:06,000
How dare you shoot me?

104
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:09,319
It was him.

105
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:14,480
Cold?

106
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:16,639
No.

107
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:21,079
Just a bit noisy.

108
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:24,040
(Is it you?)

109
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,279
