3
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,039
Was it them smashing up the shop again?

4
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:56,479
Shh.

5
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:12,760
Luo Jie.

6
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,200
Luo Jie.

7
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:17,680
Luo Jie.

8
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:19,319
Qian Gang got trashed.

9
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:21,640
Don't worry.

10
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:22,560
I'll handle it.

00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,940

(Loyalty)

13
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:45,359
Everything's arranged.

14
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,239
You can rest easy staying here.

15
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:48,120
Mm.

16
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,439
She's not a good person.

17
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:00,920
I know.

18
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,079
So you're saying
you kept her around on purpose?

19
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,680
If she's one of Xu Huai Long's people,

20
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,199
then by coming to me,

21
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,879
she'll definitely try something.

22
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:12,520
And if she doesn't?

23
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:18,240
Everyone,

24
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:20,840
now that I've obtained Xu Huai's Word,

25
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:23,039
I can rescue the Master in no time.

26
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,439
Really?

27
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:25,719
You can save my dad?

28
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,199
Of course.

29
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,919
I'm the Young Master of Qian Gang.

30
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,540
(Loyalty)

31
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,919
Second Master, Zhu Que of Qian Gang.

32
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,280
Seventh Master, Qi of Qian Gang.

33
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:44,240
- Disciples of Qian Gang.
- Disciples of Qian Gang.

34
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,120
- Welcome back, Young Master!
- Welcome back, Young Master!

35
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,560
Ah.

36
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,919
You're finally back.

37
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,800
While you were up in the mountains,
the Chief called several times.

38
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,190
He said Du Shisan can't be held indefinitely
without charges.

39
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,759
He's a sly one.

40
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:11,879
The confession he wrote

41
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:13,520
we can't file a case
without a plaintiff.

42
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,479
And we've got no plaintiff.

43
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,660
So we had no choice but to let them go.

44
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,960
Then we'll track them down one by one.

45
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:26,319
Find someone who can press charges.

46
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:32,900

00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:36,319
(Sheng's Fashion)
Boss Jin,

48
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,319
Inspector Ye's
sent word several times now.

49
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,560
Won't you go meet with her?

50
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,080
Inspector Ye?

51
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,560
So what?

52
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,080
A few days ago,

53
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,080
(Boss Jin)
it was still worth giving the precinct some respect.

54
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,930
But starting today,
there's only one person I'll respect.

55
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:50,280
Who?

56
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,400
The one who has Xu Huai's Word.

57
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,560
The one who has Xu Huai's Word?

58
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,680
We can befriend him?

59
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:56,560
Mm.

60
00:03:58,919 --> 00:03:59,319
Hey.

61
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,759
I heard something.

62
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:02,990
Boss Jia from the chamber of commerce
wants to invite him to dinner.

63
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,039
But he only eats wontons
from that one shop.

64
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,199
This is our chance to shine.

65
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:09,960
That wonton shop
we're trying to acquire,

66
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,199
the owner there

67
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,400
is as stubborn as a mule.

68
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:12,879
Mm.

69
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,199
We have to lock it down today.

70
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,399
This is our moment to prove ourselves.

71
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,040
Let's go.

72
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,530
Let's go.

73
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:29,959
Well.

74
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,439
You didn't dare show your face
the other day when you were playing dumb.

75
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,240
What now?

76
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,200
Had a change of heart?

77
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:36,959
Got the nerve to open up again?

78
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,279
Same price as before.

79
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:40,519
One silver dollar.

80
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:41,639
Selling?

81
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:43,519
Or not selling?

82
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:47,639
Hey.

83
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:50,079
I'm talking to you.

84
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:50,639
Hey.

85
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:51,880
What do you think you're doing?

86
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,439
Hmm.

87
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm hungry.

88
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,290
I've waited so long,
and still haven't gotten my wontons.

89
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,839
Can't you see we're doing business here?

90
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,519
Throwing something like that

91
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:03,680
into a pot of food isn't very sanitary.

92
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:05,360
You should pick it up.

93
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,079
Are you deaf or what?

94
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:12,079
I said, you should pick it up.

95
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:12,560
Hey,

96
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,079
don't.

97
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,639
I've got connections.

98
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:21,600
You messed

99
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,639
with the wrong guy.

100
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:24,639
Remember how Qian Gang's people

101
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,839
got taken down the other day?

102
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:26,600
Huh?

103
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:35,680
Miss,

104
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,800
I know you're helping me.

105
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,610
But Qian Gang these days
compared to the chamber of commerce,

106
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:42,160
they're not even in the same league.

107
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:43,920
Besides,

108
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:45,720
there's the police too.

109
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,519
Ah.

110
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,560
Let go.

111
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:54,000
You're all dead meat.

112
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,160
Just you wait.

113
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,879
My people are on their way right now.

114
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,040
Then go ahead and wait.

115
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,639
I...

116
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:00,839
Oh.

117
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,220
Vice Chairman, you're here.

118
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:20,839
Oh.

119
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,240
You're here.

120
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:24,399
Come in.

121
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:26,160
Please

122
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,279
take a seat.

123
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:28,000
This way.

124
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:31,800
So this is the boss
who heard Xu Huai's Word?

125
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,560
Obviously.

126
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,319
Honestly, I wasn't planning
to come today.

127
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:38,480
But then I heard

128
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,160
you bought out this shop.

129
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,040
Heh.

130
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,959
That's me.

131
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:43,290
Got it for just one silver dollar.

132
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:47,399
Just one silver dollar?

133
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:48,040
Ah.

134
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,040
That's

135
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,680
a massive rip-off for the owner.

136
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,000
Why would he ever agree to that?

137
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,720
There's more to this than you realise.

138
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:57,360
It's called kicking someone
when they're down.

139
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,240
Oh?

140
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,639
Tell me more.

141
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,519
Have you heard of Qian Gang?

142
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:04,040
Mm.

143
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:06,439
Their boss used to act like a tyrant.

144
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:07,519
No one dared cross him.

145
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,279
Then a few days ago, he was arrested.

146
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,279
A few of the Masters
went up the mountain

147
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:12,560
to deal with it in person.

148
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:16,040
That left only a bunch
of useless stragglers guarding Qian Gang.

149
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,720
So the chamber of commerce

150
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:19,319
set a trap.

151
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,120
What kind of scheme?

152
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,600
Well, we nominated
Young Master Luo to be Chairman.

153
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,879
He suggested
he will eliminate the Masters

154
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,800
on the mountain.

155
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:37,480
Then we leaked that to Qian Gang

156
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,879
and fanned the flames,
urging them to seek revenge.

157
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,040
And right then, we called the police.

158
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,480
So then,

159
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:49,959
the Qian Gang brothers
went to avenge their Masters

160
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:50,839
and ran into the cops

161
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:53,120
you tipped off ahead of time.

162
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,000
Then you took advantage of it

163
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:58,040
and started buying up their shops
at low prices.

164
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,000
Aiya.

165
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:00,720
That is quite the plan.

166
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,240
Brilliant, really.

167
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,800
Brilliant.

168
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,639
Not at all.

169
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,560
Shut that filthy mouth of yours.

170
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,040
You know,

171
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:13,000
I was with you on the mountain.

172
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,560
I had no idea
what was happening down here.

173
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,680
Absolutely no idea.

174
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,600
You bought up all of Qian Gang's shops?

175
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,720
No.

176
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:21,120
At least not this one.

177
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:24,000
We never dared touch this wonton shop.

178
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,560
And yet I paid
only one silver dollar for it.

179
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:30,480
Big mouth.

180
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,639
Take a good look.

181
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:32,879
Open your eyes.

182
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,399
This is the one
who received Xu Huai's Word,

183
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,080
the young master of Qian Gang.

184
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:38,720
You blind idiot.

185
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:40,960
Forget it.

186
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,130
I don't want the shop anymore.

187
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,180
It's just a misunderstanding.

188
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,360
A huge misunderstanding.

189
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,799
I remember this shop

190
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,279
didn't look like this before.

191
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:49,519
Yes.

192
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,879
Look at these tables.
They're completely wrecked.

193
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,639
Yes.

194
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:53,759
I'll fix them.

195
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,600
I'll fix everything.

196
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,559
Replace the ceramics.

197
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,200
Use pearwood instead.

198
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:58,720
Oh dear.

199
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:00,159
Boss, if you have any requests,

200
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,039
just name them.

201
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:02,000
Please calm down.

202
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,639
Calm down.

203
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:07,720
Come here.

204
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,159
Yes?

205
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,320
I heard

206
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:15,759
the police

207
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:17,720
