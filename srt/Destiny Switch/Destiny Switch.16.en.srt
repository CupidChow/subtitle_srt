(The Vengeance Begins)

3
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:07,840
I don't get it.

4
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:09,920
Of course you don't.

5
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,480
Why him?

6
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:13,680
He and I

7
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,319
barely even know each other.

8
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:17,439
Just because of that nonsense?

9
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:18,680
Because 24 years ago,

10
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,120
Du Shisan heard Xu Huai's Word

11
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,760
saying I could save Qian Gang.

12
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,120
Right.

13
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,480
Foolish.

14
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:24,879
Foolish.

15
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:26,000
Utterly foolish!

16
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,719
Xuan Wu grew up on the streets.

17
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,990
But he didn't have a cruel heart.

18
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:35,599
He was always bullied.

19
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,280
There are many like him,

20
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,439
drifting into gangs
without knowing better,

21
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:43,040
yet unable to kill or steal.

22
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,680
It was the Boss's
Qian Gang who took them in.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,640
But,

24
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,680
Boss hoped people in the gang

25
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,280
could live with dignity,

26
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,840
out in the open under the daylight.

27
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,159
So,

28
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,760
he started placing
more and more restrictions on us.

29
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:02,599
But,

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,760
those of us who fight
with fists and feet,

31
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:08,639
if we don't walk the gray area,

32
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,639
how are we supposed to survive?

33
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:16,599
Still,

34
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:18,520
Boss,

35
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:20,039
and Xuan Wu,

36
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,560
they believed you could do it.

37
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,820
(The memorial tablet of Qian Gang's
Third Master, Xuan Wu)

38
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:04,719
To the Master of Qian Gang,

39
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:06,280
Xuan Wu has died in vain.

40
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:07,790
This memorial is set up

41
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:09,439
to honor his spirit.

42
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,240
To the departed soul,

43
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:14,800
let us drink together.

44
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,919
A gang of bandits and thieves,

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
playing ceremonial games.

46
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,319
What a joke.

47
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:37,759
Everyone,

48
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:39,879
let me tell you something.

49
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,800
The secrets of this mountain.

50
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,120
The fog on the mountain is thick.

51
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:45,479
Inside that fog,

52
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:46,800
there's a trace of poison.

53
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:48,199
Once inhaled,

54
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:49,400
your limbs go heavy,

55
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,199
your mind goes dull,

56
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,639
you may even fall asleep.

57
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,319
And the antidote

58
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,479
was in the tea in your rooms.

59
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,520
We checked the ones who fell asleep.

60
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,319
The tea in their rooms

61
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:03,479
was untouched.

62
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:09,919
Mr. Jia.

63
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:10,879
Hmm?

64
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,690
You're in
the medicinal herb business, right?

65
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,120
You should've realised something

66
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:16,439
was off from day one.

67
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,240
I did.

68
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,570
What a coincidence.

69
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,680
Our Master Xuan Wu knew medicine too.

70
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:24,079
It was only after we met with him

71
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,680
that we figured out the truth.

72
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:29,839
Tea

73
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:31,560
needs to be taken daily.

74
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:33,839
You thought you drank today's tea,

75
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,839
but in fact, your tea
had already been swapped out by us.

76
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:38,639
You...

77
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,480
You...

78
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,240
Drink this tea, and you'll be allowed
to stay on the mountain.

79
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:43,639
Give it to me.

80
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:44,879
But,

81
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:47,040
you're not worthy.

82
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,040
With this,

83
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,160
we honor our fallen brothers.

84
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:54,959
You all

85
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:57,240
can get off this mountain.

86
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:57,639
No.

87
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,070
I want to see Xu Huai Long!

88
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,030
I want to see Xu Huai Long!

89
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,590
Give it to me!

90
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,759
I'll avenge Xuan Wu!

91
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,330
All murder cases
fall under police jurisdiction.

92
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,890
You cannot seek revenge privately.

93
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:21,360
He's the killer!

94
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:24,680
We're all witnesses.

95
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:27,439
At the time of the explosion,
I was near the inn.

96
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:29,920
I saw Luo En run out from inside.

97
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,839
The inn was far from the blast site.

98
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,720
He couldn't have teleported there.

99
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,600
Inspector Ye.

100
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,000
Help me.

101
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,399
I'm innocent.

102
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,220
I can't die wrongly
at the hands of bandits.

103
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,240
Like I said,

104
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,519
murder cases
are for the police to handle.

105
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:52,560
Trust me.

106
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:53,920
Everyone,

107
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:56,600
there's bad news.

108
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,090
There's limited tea
left on this mountain.

109
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,360
This

110
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,319
is the last pot.

111
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,720
No wonder no one

112
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,279
has ever lasted three full days here.

113
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,279
Looks like

114
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:12,240
the final test is coming.

115
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:16,319
So everyone,

116
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,720
be good and stay in the inn tonight.

117
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:28,319
Where is that girl?

118
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,600
The one we took from the old man.

119
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,240
No idea.

120
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:33,600
Ugh.

121
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,040
(Tonight is the final test.)

122
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:40,759
(Without the meta-artefact on Shelly,)

123
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:42,199
(we're in trouble.)

124
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,319
(Did she go back
to that old man's house?)

125
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,279
Where did Luo Jie go?

126
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:42,040
Ran off so fast.

127
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,639
Help me one more time.

128
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:46,879
Give me the pocket watch.

129
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,759
Didn't you want to kill Luo Jie too?

130
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:55,920
Who's there?

131
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:16,759
What now?

132
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:19,040
Such lousy skills.

133
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,199
Turn around.

134
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,159
It's you.

135
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,720
You and Luo En plotted together

136
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,080
to get Luo Jie killed?

137
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:48,399
And you figured it out.

138
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:54,120
Then I guess I'll have to silence you.

139
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:54,759
Don't move.

140
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,080
She...

141
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,000
Why would she want to kill her?

142
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:47,919
