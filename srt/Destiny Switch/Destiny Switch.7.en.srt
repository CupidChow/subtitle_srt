(A cop suddenly burst in)

3
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,239
The worst thing
in a killing is hesitation.

4
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,480
It seems Boss Du

5
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:18,359
never hesitates when you kill.

6
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:20,560
Between us,

7
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:22,140
there seems to be some misunderstanding.

8
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:30,920
The moment Luo Sifu died,

9
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,170
the people Qian Gang sent to fetch me
had probably already set off.

10
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,519
It's like you predicted his death.

11
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,040
What foresight you have.

12
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,640
You might find this hard to believe,

13
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,799
but even though
I knew he would die tonight,

14
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,519
his death

15
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,480
had nothing to do with me.

16
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:53,719
Nothing to do with you?

17
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:57,439
But if you knew he'd die tonight,

18
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,000
then you must know

19
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,560
who it was

20
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,239
that killed him.

21
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,159
Well,

22
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,200
it's complicated.

23
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:10,840
First, you'll have
to promise me something.

24
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,919
Be Qian Gang's Young Master,

25
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:16,840
I want a name,

26
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,039
nothing complicated.

27
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,039
Murder.

28
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:29,560
Murder.

29
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:31,400
Are you alright?

30
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,879
Inspector Ye.

31
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:47,360
Master Shisan.

32
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,879
How leisurely of you.

33
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,680
Inspector Ye,
you're the one enjoying leisure.

34
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,639
I heard you've been promoted recently.

35
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,919
I haven't even had time to send a gift.

36
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,639
You open fire in front of me,

37
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:03,439
isn't that a fine gift?

38
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:17,879
Wait.

39
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:19,520
You can't take him away.

40
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,560
Why not?

41
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:22,520
Because

42
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,599
I was the one who shot him.

43
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,840
Qian Gang lot always use scapegoats.

44
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,199
Got anything more original?

45
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,199
Don't you remember me?

46
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:56,600
Don't be afraid.

47
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:58,960
I'll protect you.

48
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:00,960
Don't be afraid.

49
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,599
I'll protect you.

50
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,319
Because I'm a police officer.

51
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,480
(A cop.)

52
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:34,839
(Du Shisan grabbed the gun
from my hands.)

53
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,920
(Instead of answering
my questions about the killer,)

54
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,839
(he seemed more willing
to be taken into custody.)

55
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:55,959
Please, have some tea.

56
00:04:58,279 --> 00:04:59,360
What's going on here?

57
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:02,959
Boss.

58
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:03,900
Call from the Chief.

59
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,370
Tell him I'm not here.

60
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,290
I know what you're going to say,

61
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:15,879
but I'm not letting him go.

62
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,399
How many officers do we have?

63
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:19,040
Forty-eight.

64
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,560
And how many are in Qian Gang?

65
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,830
Two or three hundred, I think.

66
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,319
Do you really believe all these years,

67
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:27,680
it's been the police
keeping Qian Gang in check?

68
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,720
Or has it been
Boss Du holding them back?

69
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,600
Let him go.

70
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:34,319
Boss.

71
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,560
Are we really letting him go?

72
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,240
Boss.

73
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,759
Even if you don't release him now,

74
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,600
the Chief will just order it later.

75
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:43,920
You'll have to let him go anyway.

76
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,879
Oh, right.

77
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,970
Someone came
to the station this morning to report

78
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,160
that Luo Sifu,
Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce,

79
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,240
is dead.

80
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,439
You two fought for so many years.

81
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:01,920
Now he's dead...

82
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,980
You've gained the most
from it, haven't you?

83
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,079
The person who reported it
identified the killer,

84
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,639
and gave us their current location.

85
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,710
I'll go arrest them first, then.

86
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,879
Since Boss Du's suspected
of hiring a killer,

87
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:18,990
we'll keep him detained for now.

88
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:34,240
This man has no shame.

89
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,959
Crawling, grovelling, bowing like a dog.

90
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:39,399
This man has no conscience.

91
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,000
Greedy for money, betraying friends,
killing his own father.

92
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,759
This man is shameless.

93
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:47,360
How could someone so vicious exist?

94
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,759
Utterly shameless. Truly despicable.

95
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,180
(Billionaire's illegitimate son,
Luo Jie kills father at night)

96
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,759
(Who could it be?)

97
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,519
(I will find you no matter what.)

98
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,720
It's confirmed
he's being held at the police station.

99
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,279
Let's go.

100
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:06,160
Hey.

101
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,920
Don't be in such a rush to leave.

102
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,120
You and I

103
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:13,240
need to talk.

104
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,740
(Fourth Master of Qian Gang, Bai Hu)

105
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:19,759
Someone this shameless,

106
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,360
disloyal,

107
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,439
and who killed his own father,

108
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,480
how can someone
like that lead Qian Gang?

109
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:26,759
Ask the brothers.

110
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:27,510
Do they accept him?

111
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:28,720
- No way!
- No way!

112
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:29,879
Brother.

113
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,800
What's most important right now

114
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,839
isn't getting the boss out.

115
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,399
It's taking this chance

116
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:37,279
while the boss is stuck at the station

117
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,560
to get rid of this fool
who's bewitched him

118
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,439
and might just destroy
Qian Gang entirely.

119
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:42,959
Brother.

120
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,160
We've found him.

121
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:49,120
Someone spotted him out on the street.

122
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,519
Come with me.

123
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,839
For Qian Gang,

124
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:52,800
kill the weakling.

125
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,480
