(The Meta-Artefact Revealed)

3
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,840
You...

4
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:56,560
What are you doing?

5
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,240
So...

6
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:05,959
This is the secret of Mount Huaien.

7
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:17,460
White Tiger is strong. You go first.

8
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:17,840
Go!

9
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,599
This is Qian Gang's business.

10
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:39,319
Master White Tiger.

11
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,599
Well, what a coincidence.

12
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,879
Aren't you the traitor
who framed the boss

13
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:45,000
and killed his own father?

14
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,239
I'm really curious.

15
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:48,799
How did you

16
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,079
get out of the station?

17
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,280
Perfect.

18
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:53,159
Today, you'll get a taste

19
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,280
of my tricks.

20
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:55,599
You're asking for death.

21
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:56,760
Stop.

22
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:01,920
What a powerful meta-artefact.

23
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,239
It actually lets me
control intent power from afar.

24
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,080
Too slow.

25
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,080
Too slow.

26
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,000
Still too slow.

27
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:18,960
What's going on?

28
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:21,120
Was White Tiger really too slow?

29
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:23,439
That can't be.

30
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,319
He's so weak.

31
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,560
How did he dodge White Tiger's strike?

32
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,840
So boring.

33
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:30,250
I'm done playing with you.

34
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:30,960
Stop!

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,919
Let's get him together!

36
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:01,280
Looks like I still have to protect you.

37
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:03,919
Mm.

38
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,599
Let's go.

39
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,400
Why is the snow getting heavier

40
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,960
the further in we go?

41
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,199
(That's right.)

42
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:55,240
(The meta-artefact is right here.)

43
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:02,120
Stop staring at me.

44
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,439
You're a cop.

45
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:04,680
You're scaring me.

46
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,660
I wasn't looking at you.

47
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,280
I was just thinking.

48
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,639
What kind of technique is that?

49
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:10,599
You move so fast.

50
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:13,960
Technique?

51
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,800
I don't know any techniques.

52
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,079
I'm useless.

53
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,639
I even need a woman to protect me.

54
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:20,560
Mm.

55
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:56,839
Let me help you.

56
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,480
Let us help you.

57
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,399
Do you sell your wares?

58
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:33,920
No.

59
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,720
Shelly.

60
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,000
Where's the water?

61
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:43,680
Coming.

62
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,399
(Shelly.)

63
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,800
So slow.

64
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:19,839
Didn't eat, huh?

65
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,560
This is someone's home.

66
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,360
Don't go too far.

67
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,879
(That meta-artefact)

68
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:47,160
(is on her.)

69
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,000
I sincerely want to buy something
from your home.

70
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,439
Name your price.

71
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,319
Money...

72
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:01,519
I don't want it.

73
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:04,199
But we can play

74
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:06,000
a riddle game.

75
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:07,839
Riddles?

76
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:09,480
Three riddles.

77
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:10,600
As long as you

78
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:12,480
answer any one of them correctly,

79
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,519
you can take

80
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:15,360
the thing you want.

81
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,560
Alright.

82
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,000
It's a deal.

83
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:39,519
First question.

84
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:41,720
Why

85
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,439
is a pig considered stupid?

86
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:44,759
Huh?

87
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,800
Then second question.

88
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:51,879
Why

89
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:54,240
is a human considered smart?

90
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,639
This is so hard.

91
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:01,959
What kind of questions are these?

92
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:04,920
Third question.

93
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,600
How does a pig

94
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,120
become

95
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,160
a human?

96
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,120
When does a pig

97
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,079
become a person?

98
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,160
Since you can't answer,

99
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,839
then I won't see you out.

100
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,399
Hey.

101
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:28,920
Give me a moment to think.

102
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:40,679
She's gone. Why are you still looking?

103
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:56,639
Bosses,

104
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,080
those people at the station,

105
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,200
they knew they couldn't beat all of you,

106
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:01,919
so they took your money

107
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,200
and let you board the train.

108
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,039
But the ones who made it here,

109
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:06,480
they've all got real strength.

110
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:07,759
To be frank,

111
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:08,639
tonight,

112
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,960
we plan to wipe out
the rest on this mountain.

113
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:11,799
As for you,

114
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:13,240
leave your money

115
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,440
and go back down safely.

116
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:16,360
We'll save ourselves the trouble too.

117
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:17,960
Well?

118
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,279
You done?

119
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,000
Yeah, done.

120
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:25,519
Bring a basin of water.

121
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:26,919
Water?

122
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,200
What for?

123
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,279
To wash my hands.

124
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:31,159
Ah?

125
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:31,840
Wash...

126
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,039
Boss Luo.

127
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,440
Master Luo.

128
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:39,600
Impressive.

129
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:40,960
Truly impressive.

130
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,879
Didn't expect you had it in you.

131
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,360
If you get to meet
that person this time,

132
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,720
and obtain Xu Huai's Word,

133
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:48,559
please make sure to take me with you.

134
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:51,720
Don't worry.

135
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,759
Whoever gets Xu Huai's Word,

136
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:57,080
and becomes master of Fengxi,

137
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:58,879
will be me.

138
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:00,919
It'll definitely be you.
No one else but you.

139
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:10,639
Take it.

140
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:12,279
Follow me.

141
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:24,180
(Four days left. Sixteen remain.)

142
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,440
It's the middle of the day,

143
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,840
why is it so dark here?

144
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,240
