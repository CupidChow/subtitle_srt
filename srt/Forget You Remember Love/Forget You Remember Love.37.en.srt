11
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,190
What are you doing?

12
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,520
Looking at you.

13
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,550
What’s there to look?

14
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,630
I’ve been busy all day

15
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,190
and haven’t got time to shower.

16
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,600
My face is dirty.

17
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,840
I must look terrible.

18
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,720
It’s OK.

19
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,600
I love the way you are.

20
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:38,270
This kind of smell

21
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,960
represents true happiness.

22
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,550
You have a strange taste.

23
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,750
I do,

24
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,160
or why would I fall in love with you?

25
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,630
What did you say?

26
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,910
You want to taste my fist again?

27
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,720
A bit salty.

28
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,830
Go away!

29
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,440
What are you doing?

30
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,720
Tang saw us!

31
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,960
He saw everything!

32
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,750
So what?

33
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,750
I was kissing no other but my girlfriend.

34
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,520
Who’s your girlfriend?

35
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,240
You.

36
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:44,820
So,

37
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,340
are you willing to make it official?

38
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,440
Yeah.

39
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,000
You’re such a wild girl.

40
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,450
Wild?

41
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,630
Let me show you

42
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,800
how wild I can be?

43
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,880
Add a few Sichuan peppers to spice it up.

44
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,510
Not too many.

45
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,040
Stew it for another ten minutes, then it’s done.

46
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,950
Add some soy sauce, too.

47
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:34,600
It’s empty.

48
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:35,200
I’ll go get another bottle.

49
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:36,810
OK.

50
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,390
What’s wrong?

51
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,790
This is too much.

52
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,350
Gosh!

53
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,040
My eyes hurt!

54
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,760
They aren’t a good match at all.

55
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,200
What?

56
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:02,550
You mean

57
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,640
Qianyu isn’t good enough for your son?

58
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,760
Oh, please.

59
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,480
Your son is practically

60
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,830
clinging on to my daughter.

61
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,040
A seemingly imperfect match

62
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,950
might just be perfect.

63
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,230
You’re right.

64
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,760
I mistook you.

65
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,440
Hey, don’t you need soy sauce?

66
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,200
Help me with my work.

67
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:29,920
I’ll replace soy sauce

68
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,320
with sugar.

69
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,270
I’ve warned you already

70
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,350
that Marv has done money laundering.

71
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,320
It’s working with Senwell.

72
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,550
Why did you care so much

73
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,070
that you asked me to take the red-eye?

74
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:42,790
Relax.

75
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:43,640
Your pay will be doubled.

76
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,510
That’s more like it.

77
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,110
Marv’s firewall

78
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,070
is weak.

79
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:52,950
I’m in.

80
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:53,950
What did you find?

81
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,640
These are communication records

82
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,830
between Marv and Senwell

83
00:05:58,830 --> 00:05:59,830
regarding a chain supermarket project.

84
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,760
According to this pattern,

85
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,480
they gain eight billion in ten
by money laundering.

86
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,200
If this gets out,

87
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,350
they’ll rot in jail, no doubt.

88
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,070
Also, not only is Xu Ziqian

89
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,320
aware of it,

90
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,720
but he’s also part of it.

91
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,200
Why would he do that?

92
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,670
There’s more.

93
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,830
He and Marv

94
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,880
are negotiating the equity transfer.

95
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,040
Qiu Hanlin and Lin Zichao are involved in it, too.

96
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,040
Mr. Qiu and Mr. Lin?

97
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,350
They’re siding with Xu Ziqian
right after getting out of jail?

98
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:32,950
That’s correct.

99
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,880
Xu Ziqian, Qiu Hanlin and Lin Zichao

100
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,550
intend to

101
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,640
transfer all their shares to Marv.

102
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,110
The chain supermarket project
is only to test the water.

103
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,160
If it works, the transfer will be put into action.

104
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:52,160
01,

105
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,040
send me all the files.

106
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,270
OK.

107
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,000
This house

108
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,600
is filled with stinky romance now.

109
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,950
Shengzhe,

110
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,720
I made night snacks. Do you want some?

111
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,040
Yeah.

112
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,350
Let’s go.

113
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,510
Look,

114
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,440
it’s nothing stinky.

115
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,200
You’ll get it when you’re old enough.

116
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,480
I am now.

117
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,390
Qianyu.

118
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,440
I start to realize

119
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,720
why Tonghao loved this place so much.

120
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:54,550
Why?

121
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,950
Because of you.

122
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,320
You can tell me if you love me.

123
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,230
No need to be shy.

124
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,830
You love the blunt type?

125
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:10,480
Yeah.

126
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,110
Are you insane?

127
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:22,000
We’re at home. Behave yourself.

128
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,270
You said you love me being blunt.

129
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,440
I...

130
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:27,760
I...

131
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,760
Taichu? What brings you here?

132
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:08,230
I’m here to see Shan Junhao.

133
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:17,780
= Chain Supermarket Project =

134
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,220
= Mail Inbox =

135
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,440
So this is Ziqian’s exit plan.

136
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,960
Mr. Qiu and Mr. Lin

137
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,880
have always held grudges against me.

138
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,080
However much Ziqian hates us,

139
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,760
he can’t destroy your fathers’ legacies.

140
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:38,150
This project is just a start.

141
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,230
If Senwell

142
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,470
is merged into Marv,

143
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,760
it’ll be a disaster.

144
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,150
What should we do?

145
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,760
We must stop them.

146
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,670
I simply don’t want

147
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,200
Guanmei Development Project to be affected.

148
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,350
Taichu,

149
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,550
thanks for your information.

150
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,550
You’re welcome, Mrs. Shan.

151
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:11,670
Ziqian will only listen to one person.

152
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,080
Yunyi?

153
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,030
Yunyi.

154
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:32,960
Mom. What’s up?

155
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,590
Is everything OK?

156
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,280
Do you know

157
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,280
Ziqian is going to sell all his shares

158
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:40,520
to Marv?

159
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,710
What?

160
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,790
I thought he’d only cooperate with Marv

161
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,640
on the chain supermarket project.

162
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,030
That’s only a trial

163
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,550
to prepare for the equity transfer.

164
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,030
Turns out,

165
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,080
Marv is deeply rooted.

166
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,280
It’s also involved

167
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,910
in multiple money laundering cases,

168
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,110
including the chain supermarket project.

169
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,590
Impossible!

170
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,640
Ziqian would never engage in that.

171
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,110
This includes

172
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,640
all the messages sent between them.

173
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:18,710
You can take a look.

174
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:27,460
= Mail Inbox =

175
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,550
Where did you get these?

176
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:34,840
They can’t be true.

177
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,470
I’m sure

178
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,230
Ziqian doesn’t know about this.

179
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,400
Did he say anything to you?

180
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,760
He only told me

181
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,550
to leave with him

182
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,280
once he took care of the company.

183
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:56,910
He probably still hates us

184
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,400
because of the past.

185
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,000
And he detests Senwell, too.

186
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:04,640
That’s why he’s decided to sell it.

187
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,110
Yunyi,

188
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,200
please talk to Ziqian.

189
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,960
Right now,

190
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,320
he only listens to you.

191
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,670
If what you said is true,

192
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,880
I’ll tell him to stop.

193
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,760
They haven’t signed the contract.

194
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,470
It’s not too late for Ziqian to quit,

195
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,760
but it won’t be easy.

196
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,080
Investment in the chain supermarket project

197
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,280
reaches ten billion yuan.

198
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:38,280
If he’s involved in money laundering,

199
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:39,760
he’ll face

200
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,150
criminal liability.

201
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,620
= Ziqian =

202
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,550
Hello, Ziqian?

203
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,030
Yunyi, I know where we should go.

204
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,760
What about Melbourne?

205
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:05,470
It’s one of the most livable cities in the world.

206
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,840
I like it.

207
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,440
I’ve also selected a few houses,

208
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,320
including manors and garden villas.

209
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:17,400
I’ll send you the details.

210
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,230
Have a look.

211
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,280
OK.

212
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,790
What are you doing?

213
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,440
I’m out for a walk

214
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,230
and having coffee now.

215
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,590
I’m sorry

216
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,310
that I can’t be with you.

217
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,790
I’ll finish my business

218
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,760
as soon as possible.

219
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,840
It’s OK.

220
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,550
Don’t worry about me.

221
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:44,840
Go back to work then.

222
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,670
Take care of yourself.

223
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,590
I will.

224
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,910
What on earth are you doing?

225
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,790
Is it so hard

226
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,110
to knock at the door?

227
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,760
I calculated

228
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,840
the actual budget for
the chain supermarket project.

229
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,760
The number is way off

230
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,790
from that in the proposal.

231
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,160
Can you explain that to me?

232
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,710
Why should I?

233
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,110
Zhang Minghan,

234
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,670
don’t you find yourself pathetic?

235
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,110
You said Senwell

236
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,350
means the most to you.

237
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,590
However,

238
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:50,550
it’s merely a shell built on profits.

239
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,760
What’s that supposed to mean?

240
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:56,110
Get out.

241
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,280
Everything will go as planned.

242
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:19,020
= Money Bag Grocery =

243
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,420
Who is this?

244
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,350
How would I know?

245
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,110
Who...

246
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,000
Who is this?

247
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,470
Mr. Shan. Mrs. Shan.

248
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Dawei?

249
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,280
What brings you here?

250
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,150
There’s someone you need to see.

251
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,000
Mr. Shan. Mrs. Shan.

252
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,440
You guys take your time.

253
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:18,200
Let’s go.

254
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:18,760
Let’s go.

255
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,550
Leave.

256
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,030
Alright. Let’s go.

257
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:22,960
Come on.

258
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,470
Yunyi.

259
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,640
Yunyi, I’m back.

260
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:47,030
Did you read my email?

261
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,440
I am reading now.

262
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,200
Is there a particular one you prefer?

263
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,670
The Toorak one is perfect.

264
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,080
I already know how to decorate it.

265
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,640
Then you...

266
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:01,640
Yunyi.

267
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,840
What’s on your mind?

268
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,000
Ziqian,

269
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:10,920
I want to ask you something.

270
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,000
What is it? Shoot.

271
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,640
Promise me

272
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,350
that you’ll be honest.

273
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,710
I’m sorry

274
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,400
if I scared you.

275
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,230
Mr. Shan. Mrs. Shan.

276
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,040
He’s Jiang Xiaoqiang,

277
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,520
a survivor in the Changfeng Explosion.

278
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,160
During the explosion,

279
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,230
more than one person survived

280
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:56,950
other than Ziqian?

281
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:57,710
Yes.

282
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:00,470
Only the two of us

283
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,640
survived in that horrific accident.

284
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:06,710
What exactly happened?

285
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:15,000
Back then, Chairman Shan

286
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:18,280
did give a yacht to Xu Yifeng

287
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,160
and named it Changfeng.

288
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,310
I was

289
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,280
the captain.

290
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,560
I saw the news.

291
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:28,830
It said

292
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,710
that Chairman Shan

293
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:33,110
created the explosion

294
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:35,310
and you

295
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:38,110
and Mrs. Shan got implicated because of it.

296
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:40,920
I feel

297
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,400
I should come forward

298
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,160
and tell you the truth.

299
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,400
I didn’t tell you about it because

300
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,160
I don’t want you to spare your worries.

301
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:57,760
Or you’d be caught in a dilemma.

302
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,590
Now that you know,

303
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,590
are you taking their side?

304
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,680
I’m not taking sides.

305
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,760
But what Dad did

306
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,000
has nothing to do with Mom or Junhao.

307
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,920
They didn’t know about it.

308
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,350
And they’ve paid the price

309
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,430
for Dad’s faults

310
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:22,760
and given up everything.

311
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,880
Ziqian,

312
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,160
let it stop.

313
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:29,400
All these years,

314
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,190
I was trying my best to look after them

315
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,880
and help them

316
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:38,950
out of gratitude.

317
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,830
But what did they do to me?

318
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,540
I realize

319
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,590
a kind heart

320
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,280
is the cheapest thing in the world.

321
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,430
We had so much fun together,

322
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:01,070
didn’t we?

323
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,040
Junhao, you and I

324
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,560
grew up together

325
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,310
like siblings.

326
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,110
Mom and Dad

327
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,920
treated us like their own.

328
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:13,710
Since we were little,

329
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,590
we had

330
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,800
whatever Junhao had.

331
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,950
We were treated equally.

332
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,430
No matter what happened,

333
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:25,110
their love for us is real.

334
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:27,310
No.

335
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,470
Shan Yaolong didn’t love us.

336
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,110
Thanks for telling us all these.

337
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,680
After the accident,

338
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:49,160
Chairman Shan treated me well.

339
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,590
Without him,

340
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,920
I wouldn’t have lived this long.

341
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,400
This is the least I should do.

342
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:59,590
Hope it’s not too late.

343
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,280
If you need me to testify,

344
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,640
feel free to contact me.

345
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,310
Thanks.

346
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:16,590
I’m leaving then.

347
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,800
Let me show you out.

348
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:26,190
I knew your dad

349
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,640
wasn’t that kind of person.

350
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:30,520
He’d never do such things.

351
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,070
Mr. Shan.

352
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:38,280
We should

353
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,680
pay another visit to Ding Yuanxun

354
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:43,110
because their stories don’t match.

355
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:44,640
Yes.

356
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,800
But I’m worried about you.

357
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,160
If you’re related

358
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,640
to the money laundering,

359
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,070
the consequence will be dire.

360
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,070
If it worries you so much,

361
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,520
I’ll finish the equity transfer

362
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,920
before the supermarket project is launched.

363
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,310
But you are one of the initiators.

364
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,950
You can’t get away with it.

365
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:22,800
Marv’s alleged money laundering business

366
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,400
is only a rumor.

367
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,920
There’s no proof.

368
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:31,000
It’s most likely a lie

369
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,070
that Shan Junhao created

370
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,800
to prevent me from selling Senwell.

371
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:36,830
Ziqian,

372
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,160
you...

373
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,880
Yunyi, stop.

374
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:45,430
The end of Senwell

375
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,830
marks the beginning of our future.

376
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,310
Mr. Qiu, Mr. Lin.

377
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,070
I’m short of cash.

378
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,470
Can you...

379
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,590
You claimed it’s urgent,

380
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:35,160
but you simply want money.

381
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,760
Don’t think we don’t know

382
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,640
you still go to Macao to gamble.

383
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:41,800
That’s my only hobby.

384
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,590
Hobby?

385
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,830
Hadn’t you gambled too much,

386
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:49,710
would Shan Yaolong have fired you?

387
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,520
Would you have ended up like this?

388
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,280
We’ve paid

389
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,760
your two million gambling debt.

390
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,230
Ding Yuanxun,

391
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,070
don’t be too greedy.

392
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:04,190
You only paid two million

393
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,190
to turn Xu Ziqian and Shan Junhao

394
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:08,160
against each other.

395
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:13,310
That’s too good a bargain.

396
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,230
Ding Yuanxun.

397
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,590
Listen,

398
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,400
if you think you have leverage

399
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:28,110
to extort money from us over and over,

400
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,680
you can’t be more wrong.

401
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,280
Mr. Lin, let’s go.

402
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:43,830
Mr. Qiu,

403
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:46,710
Ding Yuanxun

404
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,830
will be a big problem.

405
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,800
We have to find a chance

406
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,110
to get rid of him.

407
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,430
Keep him for now.

408
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:55,830
He can still bite.

409
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:56,640
Let’s go.

410
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,560
Mr. Shan? What brings you here?

411
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:31,920
Have a seat, please.

412
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:34,950
Let… Let me clean it up.

413
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:40,230
Please.

414
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:55,640
Ding Yuanxun.

415
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:58,760
You still have a chance to tell me the truth.

416
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,040
What truth?

417
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:03,920
Mr. Shan.

418
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,880
I’ve told you everything I know.

419
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,190
Other than Xu Ziqian,

420
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,680
one more person survived the explosion.

421
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,070
He told me

422
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,640
it was an accident.

423
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:16,830
No way!

424
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,560
Chairman Shan ordered me in person

425
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,230
to tamper with the yacht.

426
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:24,000
Because of that,

427
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,070
I’ve been living a hellish life

428
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:28,280
over the past 20 years.

429
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,880
You know how Mr. Qiu and Mr. Lin

430
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,110
went behind the bars?

431
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,640
I’m sure you’ve heard

432
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,280
what kind of men they are.

433
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,070
You don’t know them at all.

434
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:48,110
Now it isn’t too late

435
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,400
to right your wrong,

436
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,920
or you’ll die without knowing it.

437
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:57,470
They won’t cave to threats.

438
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,190
Mr. Shan.

439
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,280
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

440
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,310
Ding Yuanxun.

441
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,040
Don’t fool yourself, OK?

442
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,040
Perjury

443
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,590
is a criminal offense.

444
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,830
What I said is all true.

445
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:18,230
Why are you forcing me

446
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:19,310
to lie?

447
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,830
Do you know what the truth is?

448
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,000
If you still refuse to confess,

449
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,070
then I can’t help you.

450
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,380
= Zhang Minghan =

451
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,640
Stop!

452
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,160
Freeze!

453
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:56,350
Go that way.

454
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:10,800
What’s wrong with you?

455
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,640
Stop!

456
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,980
= Mr. Qiu =

457
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,280
Hello.

458
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,920
Mr. Qiu,

459
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,110
Shan Junhao just came to me.

460
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,950
He seems to have known everything.

461
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,950
What’s next, Mr. Shan?

462
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,800
Should we call the police?

463
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:01,280
We have no evidence.

464
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,280
The police can’t help us.

465
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:05,160
What?

466
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,310
How could I?

467
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,110
I didn’t say a word.

468
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,040
Hello?

469
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:23,950
OK.

470
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,110
See you in a bit.

471
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:27,520
Who was that?

472
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:29,880
Zhang Minghan.

473
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:31,680
Let’s go.

474
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:37,000
If you want me to keep your secret,

475
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:40,070
wire the money to my account now.

476
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:57,950
Zhang Minghan.

477
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,800
Sit.

478
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,710
What do you want?

479
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,590
Ziqian is destroying Senwell.

480
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:22,710
I can’t stop him.

481
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,520
I already know.

482
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,070
What did you hear?

483
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,710
The chain supermarket project and equity transfer.

484
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:34,800
Equity transfer?

485
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,710
You probably don’t know that.

486
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,400
What’s going on?

487
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,520
The chain supermarket project

488
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:45,190
is a cover for Marv’s money laundering business.

489
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,000
This is just a start.

490
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,590
Once the cooperation succeeds,

491
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,560
Xu Ziqian will sell all his shares

492
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,560
to Marv.

493
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:55,110
Mr. Qiu and Mr. Lin are the middlemen.

494
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:58,040
What?

495
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,470
Take it.

496
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,220
Take a photo of it.

497
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,060
= Xu Ziqian =
Yes.

498
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:18,300
= Xu Ziqian =

499
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,710
Hello, Mr. Xu.

500
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,350
Mr. Qin.

501
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,500
I’ve already

502
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,190
passed all Senwell’s shares

503
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,430
to myself.

504
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,280
As for the chain supermarket project,

505
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,820
it’s all up to you.

506
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,110
Mr. Sheng and I have been waiting for this day.

507
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:41,160
Tell your lawyer to prepare the contract.

508
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,230
It’s ready

509
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:44,310
to be signed.

510
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,040
How about tomorrow?

511
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:51,350
OK. Let’s sign it at my place.

512
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,400
Sure.

513
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:08,680
Hello, 01?

514
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:10,950
Xu Ziqian has changed his mind.

515
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:12,160
He’s decided to move

516
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,470
the equity transfer signing forward.

517
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:14,760
The time and place have been settled.

518
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,920
I’m sending them to you now.

519
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,160
OK. Thanks.

520
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:24,520
I’m sorry.

521
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,430
I shouldn’t have trusted

522
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:28,760
Mr. Qiu and Mr. Lin,

523
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:32,310
revealed that recording

524
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,560
or introduced Ding Yuanxun to Xu Ziqian.

525
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,590
What do you mean?

526
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:43,040
When Mr. Qiu and Mr. Lin were in jail,

527
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:45,310
they implied that Mr. Xu

528
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:47,070
was forced to sell his shares

529
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:49,110
and asked me to dig deeper.

530
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,680
I happened to find

531
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,760
the recording about him and your father

532
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,180
signing the transfer agreement

533
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,760
because my father recorded it.

534
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,310
After Mr. Qiu and Mr. Lin

535
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:04,000
were released,

536
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:05,190
they told me

537
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:06,560
they had found Ding Yuanxun.

538
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:10,520
So those two are the masterminds.

539
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,470
And you gave Ziqian

540
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,920
that recording.

541
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:18,310
Junhao,

542
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:20,280
I admit

543
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,040
I did intend to drive a wedge

544
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:25,350
between you and Ziqian

545
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:27,000
to remove you from your post,

546
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:29,760
but I never ever anticipated

547
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,110
that Ziqian would go this far.

548
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,350
I hope we can stop him together

549
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:37,520
for Senwell.

550
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:46,800
Jiang Xiaoqiang and Ding Yuanxun present together

551
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,110
can make the truth come out.

552
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:50,710
But...

553
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,880
Ding Yuanxun escaped.

554
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,020
I found out

555
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:00,520
that your father fired Ding Yuanxun

556
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,830
because he was addicted to gambling.

557
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:04,190
He was unable to change.

558
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:05,880
I suspected him

559
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:08,560
but he denied it.

560
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,700
It’s most likely

561
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:12,910
that he lied for money.

562
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:20,180
= 01 =

563
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:34,520
Xu Ziqian has decided

564
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,320
to move the equity transfer signing forward.

565
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:37,950
The time and place have been settled.

566
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,120
It’s tomorrow.

567
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:42,080
OK.

568
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:44,320
I see.

569
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,840
What’s wrong, Mr. Shan?

570
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,190
The equity transfer signing

571
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,150
has been moved up.

572
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:55,390
The time and place are settled.

573
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,520
It’s tomorrow.

574
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,230
What?

575
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:04,760
If Senwell

576
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,600
falls into their hands,

577
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:08,320
it’ll become Keyi Group’s largest company

578
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,950
for money laundering.

579
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:14,190
Then Senwell will be doomed.

580
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:16,390
We can’t let it happen.

581
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:18,870
We must find Ding Yuanxun before the signing

582
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,120
to stop Xu Ziqian.

583
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,230
It’s like finding a needle in a haystack.

584
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,910
How can we find him?

585
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:33,910
Mr. Xu.

586
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,040
Please.

587
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:36,430
Thanks.

588
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,280
Mr. Xu.

589
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:39,840
Are you busy?

590
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,360
What are you here for?

591
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:48,000
Nothing important.

592
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,870
It’s just the signing is tomorrow.

593
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:53,080
We simply want to make sure it’ll go smoothly.

594
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,000
Nothing will happen.

595
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:58,280
What’s your point?

596
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,390
Here’s the thing, Mr. Xu,

597
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,360
Shan Junhao is forcing Ding Yuanxun

598
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,360
to alter his testimony.

599
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:07,190
He wants you to believe

600
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:09,080
there was no conspiracy.

601
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:10,000
So,

602
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:11,950
no matter what he says to you,

603
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,320
you can’t believe him.

604
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,870
I bet a spoiled brat like him

605
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:17,800
can’t stand living in a village.

606
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:21,040
So he attempts to get Senwell back.

607
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:28,080
It’s all settled.

608
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,870
What’s to worry?

609
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,910
Since Shan Junhao

610
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:36,280
has tracked down Ding Yuanxun,

611
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,390
he must have other plans as well.

612
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:42,320
The signing tomorrow

613
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,120
must go flawlessly.

614
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,040
Hello, Mr. Shan?

615
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,760
Dawei. How did it go?

616
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,760
I’ve waited for a night.

617
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,670
He isn’t back yet.

618
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,430
Well,

619
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,120
bring Jiang Xiaoqiang over.

620
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,230
I’ll be there later.

621
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,280
OK, got it.

622
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:55,950
Any sign of Ding Yuanxun?

623
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,190
Not yet.

624
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,280
What should we do?

625
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:02,120
Xu Ziqian is about to sign the contract.

626
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:03,560
I asked Dawei

627
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,520
to bring Jiang Xiaoqiang there first.

628
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:06,840
I’m going to join them.

629
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:08,950
I’ll go with you.

630
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:14,320
No need.

631
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:15,630
I’ve made arrangements.

632
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,150
Wait for me at home.

633
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:27,800
I’ll be back soon.

634
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:29,360
Alright.

635
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,150
Ziqian,

636
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:37,870
don’t go.

637
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:50,950
Mr. Xu.

638
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,670
I’m waiting for you at the club.

639
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:54,710
Don’t be late.

640
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:57,230
Let’s drink together after the signing.

641
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,430
I’ve prepared the finest wine

642
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:04,320
to toast to our success.

643
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:09,760
Let’s go.

644
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,040
Keep what I said in mind.

645
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:27,760
Yes.

646
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,390
Ziqian.

647
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,560
Ziqian.

648
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:48,800
What are you doing here?

649
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,870
Before you sign the contract,

650
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,230
I’d like to have a word with you.

651
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,120
I have nothing to say to you.

652
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:57,910
Ziqian.

653
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,120
Do you recognize me?

654
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:05,760
Who are you?

655
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,630
The last time I saw you,

656
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:10,600
you were only eight.

657
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,870
You loved Changfeng Yacht.

658
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:16,120
I was the captain, Jiang Xiaoqiang.

659
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,230
Changfeng Yacht?

660
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:19,560
Didn’t Chairman Xu and his wife

661
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,150
die on that yacht?

662
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:22,120
Yes.

663
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,320
I survived

664
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,230
and became like this.

665
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,280
Mr. Zhang, we found Ding Yuanxun.

666
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,040
That day,

667
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:40,760
you and your mother boarded the yacht first.

668
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,230
Later,

669
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:45,000
your father showed up in rage.

670
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,190
Once he was on board,

671
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,950
he came straight to the steering room.

672
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,280
He pushed me aside

673
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,670
and controlled the yacht himself. It was fast.

674
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,950
I was a little concerned

675
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:57,120
but your father seemed angry.

676
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,230
I couldn’t stop him.

677
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:00,320
The yacht went too fast

678
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:02,120
to avoid

679
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,120
the submerged reef.

680
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:06,120
When I warned him,

681
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,000
it was too late to go around it.

682
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:10,280
The yacht crashed,

683
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:11,520
and then the oil leaked,

684
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:13,430
casing the explosion.

685
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:17,320
It was an accident.

686
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:24,950
Even if you were the captain,

687
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,230
why should I believe you?

688
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:29,320
This scar

689
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:31,520
was caused by that accident.

690
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,360
Trust me.

691
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,870
Chairman Shan would never hurt your parents.

692
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:38,560
After the accident,

693
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,360
he blamed himself

694
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,280
and regretted giving your father that yacht.

695
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:48,120
Shan Junhao,

696
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:50,910
you think you can stop me in this way?

697
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:54,000
Senwell no longer belongs to you.

698
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:55,950
Ziqian,

699
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:59,320
my dad shouldn’t have forced Uncle Xu

700
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,280
to sell his shares.

701
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,280
Or he wouldn’t have been so angry

702
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,360
when he boarded the yacht

703
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:06,190
and caused the accident.

704
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,190
But my dad didn’t ask anyone

705
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:10,840
to tamper with it.

706
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:13,840
He did care about Senwell a lot,

707
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:16,280
but he was never a bad man.

708
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,190
Ziqian,

709
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:20,840
don’t be misled by others

710
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,670
and destroy the business

711
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,470
our dads built so hard.

712
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,080
That’s only your side of the story.

713
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,150
Why should I believe you?

714
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:33,560
Ziqian,

715
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,760
Captain Jiang had no reason to lie.

716
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,280
Don’t sign it.

717
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,600
Mr. Shan...

718
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:44,870
There’s one more witness

719
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,080
on the way.

720
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,470
When you see him,

721
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:49,840
you can make your own judgement.

722
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,000
That’s unnecessary.

723
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:51,840
Ziqian,

724
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,470
don’t be devoured by hatred.

725
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:05,190
You don’t get to lecture me.

726
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,320
Ziqian!

727
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:17,430
Ziqian!

728
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,470
You can’t sign it!

729
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,710
Why hasn’t Mr. Xu come?

730
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:35,230
Calm down. Be patient.

731
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,120
Mr. Qin.

732
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,230
Mr. Xu is on the way. He’ll be here soon.

733
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:59,650
You’re finally here, Mr. Xu.

734
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:00,840
Come on in. Please have a seat.

735
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:06,430
Mr. Xu,

736
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:08,560
welcome.

737
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,520
Sorry, I was caught up with something else.

738
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:12,800
It’s OK.

739
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:13,870
Perfect timing.

740
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:18,320
Thank goodness.

741
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:23,230
Here.

742
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:26,120
To our successful cooperation.

743
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:35,710
Cheers!

744
00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:36,950
Yeah. Cheers!

745
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:38,470
- Cheers! - Cheers!

746
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:41,050
Let’s drink.

747
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:52,600
Have a seat.

They say wine and pizza

751
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:10,840
go well together.

752
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,430

Mr. Xu,

00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:42,560
sign it.

00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:43,760
Yes, Mr. Xu.

757
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:45,600
There can’t be a better price

758
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,040
than Mr. Qin’s.

759
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:48,710
Mr. Xu,

760
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:53,080
are you hesitant?

761
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:03,950
Mr. Xu,

762
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:06,360
