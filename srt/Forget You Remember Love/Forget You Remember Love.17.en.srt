Wow!

12
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,480
Tonghao works in such a fancy building!

13
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,680
He didn’t look like

14
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,190
that kind of person in Guanmei Fishing Village.

15
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:57,510
Had I known this,

16
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,910
I would’ve picked him.

17
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,630
Then Ye Qianyu would’ve been out.

18
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,950
Thank god you didn’t.

19
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,360
Otherwise, I’d be out.

20
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,600
You’re still out.

21
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,110
This durian is heavy.

22
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,390
Let’s go inside.

23
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,520
Yeah. Right.

24
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:18,520
OK, OK, OK.

25
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,380
Let’s go.

26
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,960
Hurry!

27
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,670
How can I help you?

28
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,000
We’d like to see Tonghao,

29
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,650
also your boss Shan Junhao.

30
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,680
Do you have an appointment?

31
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,520
Appointment?

32
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,030
We’re his friends.

33
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,190
Yes.

34
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,240
I’m afraid I can’t let you in.

35
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,520
We’re really close.

36
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:39,630
You can ask him.

37
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,270
I can't ask our GM this kind of question

38
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,960
If you really are his friends,

39
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,110
you can call him.

40
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,720
Once we’re given the order,

41
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,000
you can go inside.

42
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,390
We don’t have his number.

43
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,030
What should we do?

44
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,670
Sorry,

45
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:52,880
you can’t enter the building.

46
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,740
- Let’s go eat at my place after work.
- Did you check

47
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,480
- the report I gave you last time? - OK.

48
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,390
Hey, handsome,

49
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,030
how about

50
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,720
you tell him we’re here?

51
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,960
Just say we came from Guanmei Fishing Village.

52
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,670
It was a two-hour bus ride.

53
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,600
We came a long way to be here.

54
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:07,750
I’m sorry.

55
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,390
Listen,

56
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,470
if you drive your boss’s friends out,

57
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,830
he’ll punish you

58
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,720
or even fire you.

59
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:17,630
That’s right.

60
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,440
This durian

61
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,470
is for your boss.

62
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,630
It’s heavy.

63
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,080
Sorry, you need to leave.

64
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:27,490
Tonghao!

65
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:28,010
Tonghao!

66
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:28,890
Tonghao!

67
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:29,450
Tonghao!

68
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,740
Tonghao, it’s really you!

69
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,280
- Wow! - Wow!

70
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,600
You’re so hot in this suit.

71
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,520
Yeah.

72
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,030
I almost didn’t recognize you.

73
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,520
No wonder they say the clothes make the man.

74
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,800
You’re as good as Taichu.

75
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,520
A hair.

76
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,910
Hey, Tonghao,

77
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,550
I caught you careless once.

78
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,960
I brought this durian especially for you.

79
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,880
It’s your favorite fruit.

80
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,960
I picked the biggest one.

81
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:07,830
Here you are.

82
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,390
Who are you?

83
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,950
What are you doing here?

84
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,670
Tonghao,

85
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,110
it’s me, Fengqiao.

86
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,790
We came from Guanmei Fishing Village.

87
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,480
You don’t recognize us?

88
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,760
I’m not Tonghao.

89
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,760
Neither do I know you.

90
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,440
You’re Shan Junhao,

91
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,720
and also Tonghao.

92
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,350
Tonghao is our friend,

93
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,070
work partner,

94
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,440
and a hero who saved Guanmei Inn.

95
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,640
I don’t have such friends

96
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,390
and I surely won’t partner with you.

97
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,440
Tonghao,

98
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,510
what’s that supposed to mean?

99
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,000
Are you ashamed of us?

100
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,440
Are you pretending

101
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,510
not knowing us?

102
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:52,600
That’s hurtful.

103
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,350
I’ll tell you one more time.

104
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,390
I do not know you

105
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,830
or why you’re here.

106
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,040
Stop.

107
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,510
Let me ask you this.

108
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,920
Do you know Ye Qianyu?

109
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,110
No.

110
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,000
No?

111
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,040
She’s your girlfriend.

112
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,720
How could you not know her?

113
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,550
My girlfriend is this lady behind me.

114
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,420
Her name is Fan Yunyi.

115
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,040
How could you say all these words?

116
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:40,350
We adored you

117
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:43,480
and appreciated everything you did for us,

118
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,200
but we were wrong.

119
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,440
We were wrong

120
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,320
about you.

121
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,640
We didn’t know you’d be such a heartless man.

122
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,720
Just because you’re back to Senwell

123
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,270
and have got your name and status back,

124
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,230
it doesn’t mean you can despise us.

125
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,790
Don’t be so condescending!

126
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:04,640
Security,

127
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,200
show them out.

128
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:06,790
Yes.

129
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,200
We can leave ourselves.

130
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,550
No need to bother you.

131
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,720
I was envious that

132
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,440
you could work in such a luxurious place.

133
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,000
But now,

134
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,000
I can’t stay a minute longer.

135
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,160
Let’s go.

136
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:19,600
Bah!

137
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,070
My fruit is for friends.

138
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,510
You don’t deserve it. Bah!

139
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:34,830
Junhao,

140
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,920
don’t let them

141
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,720
affect you.

142
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:39,160
Let’s go.

143
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,070
We still have a meeting with Mr. Wang.

144
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:55,550
Hello?

145
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,720
Really?

146
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,070
Great! Thank you.

147
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:04,230
OK. I see.

148
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,440
We’ll do our best.

149
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,230
Tang, Tang,

150
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,760
Explore the World

151
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,070
will shoot an episode in our village.

152
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,880
The highlight will be Guanmei Inn.

153
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:14,830
They called me

154
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,040
just now.

155
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,950
That’s wonderful!

156
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:20,550
What good news! Wait…

157
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,570
I remember it.

158
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,350
It was Tonghao who invited them here.

159
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,350
Too bad,

160
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,670
he’s no longer with us.

161
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,640
I...

162
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:01,920
Where did you go?

163
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,320
I didn’t see you guys for a while.

164
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,950
We went to see Tonghao.

165
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,110
You did?

166
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,000
Yeah.

167
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,600
But he pretended he didn’t know us.

168
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,110
As if we brought shame

169
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,640
on him.

170
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,510
I didn’t want to waste my durian on him.

171
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:21,880
Otherwise,

172
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,070
I’d whack him with it.

173
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,790
Why did you go see him anyway?

174
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,040
We’d like to know

175
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:31,110
what he looked like

176
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,760
working in Senwell as their boss.

177
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,470
Yeah.

178
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,350
Ever since he went back,

179
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:37,110
he hasn’t called us even once.

180
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,320
It’s been a while.

181
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,400
We missed him.

182
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,470
Yet he acted like he didn’t know us

183
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,320
or even Qianyu

184
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:47,590
and told the security to kick us out.

185
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,350
He’s rich, so what?

186
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,350
He’s their boss but not ours.

187
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,440
He’s so heartless

188
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,000
and ungrateful!

189
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,840
If Qianyu found out about this,

190
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,470
she’d be heartbroken.

191
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,880
They had met already.

192
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,200
I hope you can

193
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,470
stop mentioning him

194
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,470
in front of her.

195
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,200
Tonghao’s forgotten about

196
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,520
everything happened in Guanmei.

197
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,470
Are you guys slacking off

198
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,790
at work again?

199
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,790
Of course not.

200
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,320
Explore the World is coming to film us.

201
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,200
Guys,

202
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,710
we need to come up with a theme.

203
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,470
Just let them do their business.

204
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,080
They can film the scenery of our village,

205
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,520
and our inn.

206
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,470
No.

207
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,960
That’s too dry.

208
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,840
No one would want to watch it.

209
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,470
Well... They can film me.

210
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,950
I’m the endorser of our village.

211
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,650
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - This show isn’t about you.

212
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,470
20 minutes of you alone?

213
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,080
Who’ll be interested?

214
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,670
Sheng can stare at me

215
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,790
for two hours without blinking.

216
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,640
You know that?

217
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,670
How about me?

218
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:05,520
They can film me.

219
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,550
My... My coconut jelly

220
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,590
is the best in the village.

221
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,000
It’s not Master Chef.

222
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,670
Viewers don’t want to know your recipe.

223
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,280
I have an idea.

224
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:19,960
It was Tonghao

225
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,760
who changed Guanmei Fishing Village so much.

226
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,110
Why don’t we make it an episode

227
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,280
to say goodbye to him?

228
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:26,960
Say goodbye to Tonghao?

229
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,400
Say goodbye to Tonghao?

230
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,230
Look, you,

231
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,760
and you guys

232
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,320
should all move on.

233
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,350
We can’t always live in the past.

234
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:56,660
= Explore the World =

235
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,030
= Guanmei Inn =

236
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,320
I’ll be on TV.

237
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:02,540
- Look at this. - This is it.

238
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,790
- It’s rolling, it’s rolling. - Let’s begin.

239
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:07,790
We’re ready, boss.

240
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,440
Guanmei Inn

241
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,670
= Explore the World =
is the oldest inn in Guanmei Fishing Village.

242
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:17,760
= Explore the World =
The Tang family built it from scratch.

243
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,400
I’m the third generation.

244
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,790
It witnessed the ups and downs of our village.

245
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:27,580
= Money Bag Grocery =

246
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,350
This is Money Bag Grocery.

247
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,710
- It’s the most profitable store in the village
- Grocery.

248
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:34,350
because

249
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,760
the goods are cheap and fine,

250
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:38,080
and the owner is a beauty.

251
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,060
Stick to the point.

252
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:41,840
Whatever you need,

253
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,550
I can give it to you within five seconds.

254
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,080
Guanmei Fishing Village is
18 degrees north latitude,

255
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,200
on the same line with other amazing sceneries.

256
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,400
The seawater quality

257
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,840
meets the first-grade national seawater standard.

258
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:55,590
I lived here for so long

259
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,400
but didn’t know that

260
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,110
until Tonghao told me.

261
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,230
Tonghao,

262
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,080
you taught me how to make the best bed.

263
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,230
Tonghao,

264
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,590
you taught me how to dry the glasses perfectly.

265
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:15,400
Tonghao,

266
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:16,710
you taught me

267
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,840
how to be the prettiest receptionist.

268
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,760
Tonghao,

269
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,230
you taught me

270
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:23,710
how to perfect the menu.

271
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,790
Tonghao,

272
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:27,670
goodbye.

273
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,150
I’ll go buy some water.

274
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,520
Guanmei Inn

275
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:47,110
is the oldest inn in Guanmei Fishing Village.

276
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,440
It was Tonghao

277
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,400
who saved

278
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:53,710
and rejuvenated it.

279
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:54,960
We had a consultant

280
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:57,710
who could read customers’ minds,

281
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,350
Tonghao.

282
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,470
Tonghao is smart.

283
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,440
He has a photographic memory.

284
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:04,520
He said

285
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:06,790
since it can’t be changed,

286
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,280
then live in the moment.

287
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:12,030
He showed me

288
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:13,110
where Taurus is.

289
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,590
He rescued me from the heavenly pit.

290
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:18,520
And he helped me find Chinese white dolphins.

291
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,640
He showed up at the party

292
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:22,470
and saved me like a prince.

293
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,910
He took me to ride the merry-go-round.

294
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:27,280
He said

295
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,670
even when our hair turned gray,

296
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,150
he’d still be with me.

297
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,440
Those memories are too good

298
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,880
to be forgotten.

299
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,670
Today,

300
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,280
I’d like to say,

301
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,150
Tonghao,

302
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
thank you.

303
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,440
I’m lucky

304
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,030
to have met you.

305
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:59,900
Thank you, Tonghao.

306
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,550
Tonghao, goodbye. Bye-bye.

307
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,880
Bye, Tonghao.

308
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:14,200
Tonghao,

309
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,080
goodbye.

310
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,760
Mr. Shan. Yunyi.

311
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:35,640
Here you are.

312
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,000
Ye Qianyu

313
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:44,590
took my money but still wouldn’t shut up.

314
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:46,230
Let’s go.

315
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,350
You’re back.

316
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:58,880
Mom.

317
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,960
Are you two OK?

318
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:13,520
Mom.

319
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:16,080
I’d like to marry Yunyi soon.

320
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,640
Really?

321
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,200
Great!

322
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,520
I can’t wait for it.

323
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:27,350
Yunyi,

324
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,200
Junhao wants to get married quickly.

325
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:31,350
Why aren’t you happy?

326
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,960
Mom, I’m a bit tired.

327
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,230
I’m going upstairs to rest.

328
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,280
Is Yunyi...

329
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:46,200
Yunyi.

330
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,200
Yunyi.

331
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:56,960
What’s wrong?

332
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,640
You don’t want to marry me?

333
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,640
Heavenly pit,

334
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:10,230
white dolphins,

335
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,200
you didn’t mention a word to me.

336
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,280
Neither did you take me to ride the merry-go-round

337
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,520
or look at the stars.

338
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:24,230
All that stuff is boring

339
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,350
and childish.

340
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,790
But you did them all with Ye Qianyu.

341
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:28,960
If you like that kind of stuff,

342
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,200
we can go to the amusement park tomorrow.

343
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,150
OK?

344
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,080
Junhao,

345
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,710
it’s not about amusement park.

346
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,000
It’s just I suddenly feel

347
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,520
I’m not special to you at all

348
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,670
compared with that Ye Qianyu.

349
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,760
Didn’t you say she’s a fraud?

350
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:47,550
Why did you believe her words?

351
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,230
Junhao,

352
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:02,080
sometimes, I don’t know

353
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:04,040
what’s on your mind.

354
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:06,880
You seldom open your heart to me.

355
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:09,880
Although we grew up together,

356
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:12,000
I just found

357
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,560
that I don’t actually know you.

358
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:17,070
That Tonghao Ye Qianyu described

359
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:19,880
is strange to me.

360
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,640
Or is that the real you?

361
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,560
Why you’ve never

362
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,310
shown me that side?

363
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,230
Yunyi,

364
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,070
I didn’t know it’d bother you so much.

365
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,590
Don’t you believe me?

366
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,000
I’d never have any relationship

367
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,590
with someone like Ye Qianyu.

368
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,110
Yunyi,

369
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:56,520
I’m marrying you.

370
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,310
We still have a lifetime

371
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,760
to know each other.

372
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:21,400
Junhao,

373
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:24,470
I love you!

374
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,040
I’ve never

375
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:31,040
been so blunt in front of you,

376
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:35,920
but I want you to know

377
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:38,880
how much you mean to me.

378
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,190
I can’t afford to lose you again.

379
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,370
Let’s get married.

380
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:59,070
I expect full-scale execution soon.

381
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,470
Alright. Dismissed.

382
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:06,710
Mr. Shan,

383
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,430
there was a small mistake

384
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,520
but I didn’t want to interrupt you.

385
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,280
Do you want me

386
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,280
to give them a correction?

387
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,040
Mr. Shan,

388
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,470
how was your meeting

389
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,680
with Mr. Wang yesterday?

390
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,190
Don’t worry.

391
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:24,640
Mr. Shan completely convinced him with the number.

392
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,920
After a few modifications,

393
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,880
it’s good to go.

394
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:32,070
When Zhang Minghan showed Mr. Wang his proposal,

395
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,280
he got rejected repeatedly.

396
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,230
Yet you nailed it at one go.

397
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,920
That’s quite a comeback.

398
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:42,310
Compared with cultural values,

399
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,000
GQ cares more about profits.

400
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:48,760
They couldn’t resist the lure of money.

401
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,950
It’s time to plan the next step.

402
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,520
While Zhang Minghan is suspended,

403
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:58,280
I want you to take over all his projects.

404
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:59,800
As for Guanmei Development Project,

405
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,950
Director Fan will assist me with it.

406
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,560
Our priority is to

407
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,710
tear down Guanmei Inn.

408
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:19,880
Zhang Minghan.

409
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,410
You’re here, Mr. Shan.

410
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,560
Aren’t you too relaxed

411
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,680
after getting that chair back?

412
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:35,110
Relaxed or not,

413
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,560
that chair isn’t yours.

414
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,560
Don’t forget

415
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:41,950
you’ve been suspended.

416
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,800
Mr. Qiu and Mr. Lin are senior members.

417
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,070
They’re at fault,

418
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:51,470
but for old times’ sake,

419
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,920
please be lenient with them.

420
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,560
Kidnapping is a criminal offence.

421
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,800
There are laws to follow.

422
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:23,920
I have no right to punish them,

423
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,920
nor is it my business to put in a good word.

424
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:29,000
Back when my father was in charge,

425
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,350
they were dishonest and greedy.

426
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,400
Had we stopped them then,

427
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:35,470
things wouldn’t have turned out like this.

428
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,070
You should be relieved

429
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,070
that their evil plan didn’t succeed.

430
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,160
Otherwise,

431
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,070
they’d commit a felony

432
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:44,590
and drag Senwell down with them.

433
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,680
They already knew they were wrong.

434
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,190
Please give them another chance.

435
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:48,920
No.

436
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,070
In this case,

437
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,470
I’m the victim.

438
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,920
Besides,

439
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,640
the one who led them astray

440
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:58,830
wasn’t me

441
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,280
but themselves

442
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:04,190
and you.

443
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:08,830
Hadn’t you

444
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:10,040
backed them up continuously,

445
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:12,160
and tried to steal my position,

446
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,590
they wouldn’t have gone that far.

447
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,070
Shan Junhao,

448
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,520
I’ve never begged you before.

449
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:24,830
And

450
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,310
you can save it now.

451
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,470
I’m doing the right thing.

452
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:32,880
Right?

453
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,040
Are you sure everything you’ve done

454
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:37,190
is right?

455
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,760
If your affair with Ye Qianyu gets out,

456
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,520
I’m not sure

457
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,640
if you can still be so confident.

458
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,350
Are you threatening me?

459
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,830
I’m not.

460
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,190
Just a friendly reminder.

461
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,160
Don’t burn down the bridge

462
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,830
or push others too hard.

463
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:00,980
Explore the World

464
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:01,950
is a popular show.

465
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:04,000
Others don’t know Tonghao is you,

466
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:05,520
but

467
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,590
once they find out,

468
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:11,000
I don’t know if you can still

469
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,190
keep your position,

470
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,070
but Senwell will suffer a huge loss for sure.

471
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,920
Zhang Minghan,

472
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:25,800
Senwell’s loss

473
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,230
won’t benefit you, either.

474
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,950
If you want to bring me down,

475
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:32,070
better think of something smart.

476
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:36,310
Drop the dirty tricks.

477
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:07,470
I think I smell money.

478
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,400
Yes.

479
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:12,950
Master.

480
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:14,000
Thank you.

481
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:15,560
So thick!

482
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:18,830
- Boss, did you count it wrong? - Thank you, Tang.

483
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,800
Whatever!

484
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:22,520
It’s ours already.

485
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,920
I didn’t.

486
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,920
The extra cash

487
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,190
is your bonus.

488
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:33,190
Our inn is finally back on track.

489
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,880
It all thanks to you.

490
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,560
I didn’t get to

491
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,880
thank you properly.

492
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,680
This is a small thank you gift.

493
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:46,000
Thank you, boss.

494
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,370
- Thank you, boss. - Thank you, boss.

495
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,860
We love this kind of gift.

496
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:54,460
= Guanmei Inn =

497
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:29,580
= Guanmei Inn =

498
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,710
Here come customers.

499
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,950
Tonghao?

500
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:39,800
How dare you show up here?

501
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,680
Watch your attitude.

502
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,760
This is the head of Senwell, Shan Junhao.

503
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:48,470
So what if you have another name?

504
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,230
We failed to see Tonghao’s true color.

505
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,640
Don’t waste any breath

506
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:52,470
on such an ingrate.

507
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,280
Leave. Get out! Out!

508
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,310
Mr. Tang,

509
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,920
is this how you receive customers?

510
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,920
You aren’t our customer!

511
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:00,830
You should leave!

512
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,520
Get out!

513
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:02,280
Leave!

514
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,590
That’s enough!

515
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,310
Stop.

516
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,160
Tonghao, sorry,

517
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,190
Mr. Shan,

518
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:11,710
this way, please.

519
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:24,110
Sheng, call Qianyu.

520
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:30,520
Qianyu,

521
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:31,640
come and beat the dog,

522
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:32,800
a big mean dog.

523
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,800
Yes, come quickly.

524
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:37,760
What did she say?

525
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,070
She’s on the way.

526
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:40,520
Crush them.

527
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:41,680
Let’s go.

528
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:44,680
Mr. Tang,

529
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:47,190
I’ll give you one week

530
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,520
to shut down this inn and move out.

531
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,110
Mr. Shan,

532
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:55,400
you helped save this place.

533
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,400
You said it’s worth operating further.

534
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,280
How could you go back on your own word?

535
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,560
Mr. Tang,

536
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,230
while I was memoryless,

537
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,430
you concealed my identity on purpose

538
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,880
and used my accident to deceive Xu Ziqian.

539
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,310
You should be glad that I let that slide.

540
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,830
What do you have to bargain with me?

541
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,640
You met Junhao in Senwell before.

542
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,880
You could’ve brought him back immediately,

543
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,560
but you didn’t.

544
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:24,350
Senwell paid a huge price

545
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,310
for your selfishness.

546
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,880
It was my fault,

547
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:31,920
but

548
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:34,350
you already accepted my apology

549
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,590
and said you’d stay in Guanmei.

550
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,710
Mr. Shan would never say that.

551
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:42,520
Tang Shunming,

552
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,880
Senwell owns this inn.

553
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,920
You have to live with it.

554
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:56,590
Guanmei Fishing Village will soon become

555
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,400
a reserve for Chinese white dolphins.

556
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,800
Any exploitation is prohibited.

557
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,400
Protecting endangered animals

558
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:13,070
is also one of Senwell’s responsibilities.

559
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:17,560
= Protective Development Proposal
Targeting Chinese White Dolphins =

560
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,350
This is

561
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:21,070
a protective development proposal.

562
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:23,230
The government has approved it.

563
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:25,160
What else do you have to say?

564
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,880
Sheng, what’s going on?

565
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,830
Didn’t you call me to beat the dog?

566
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,430
Where is it?

567
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,520
Over there.

568
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:36,400
Qianyu,

569
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,800
that jerk Tonghao said

570
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,310
although we found white dolphins,

571
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:40,880
he insisted on

572
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,680
- tearing down our inn. - Yes.

573
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:48,960
- Qianyu! - Qianyu!

574
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,110
Tonghao,

575
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,000
is it true that you plan to pull down the inn?

576
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:11,310
Listen carefully,

577
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:13,830
I’m Shan Junhao,

578
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:15,850
not Tonghao.

579
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:19,280
But...

580
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:22,830
But you used to live here.

581
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:24,430
You said you love this place

582
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,310
and want to stay here forever.

583
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,400
Ye Qianyu,

584
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,160
can you drop your act?

585
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:30,800
You should leave.

586
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:32,680
Don’t disturb our meeting.

587
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,560
Qianyu,

588
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:35,520
let’s go.

589
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:42,830
Tonghao,

590
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,710
Guanmei Inn couldn’t have come this far

591
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,920
without your effort and hard work.

592
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:50,800
How could you level it?

593
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,350
You forgot how you had helped us?

594
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:56,430
You used me.

595
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,000
Ye Qianyu.

596
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,800
You admitted that yourself.

597
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,520
Guanmei Inn has changed.

598
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,190
More rooms have been booked.

599
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,520
The quality of our service is higher.

600
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:22,760
Reviews we’ve received are all positive.

601
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:24,680
Please

602
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,110
give us some more time.

603
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,230
What I see

604
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,400
is a stinky

605
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:36,350
and shabby hovel.

606
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,000
Calm down.

607
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,520
What you’re doing is meaningless.

608
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:41,350
People travel for relaxation and enjoyment.

609
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,200
They expect high-end accommodations

610
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,470
and facilities.

611
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:48,280
Tell me,

612
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,310
what do you have?

613
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,800
And look at your staff.

614
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:57,400
- How could he say that? - They eavesdrop

615
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:58,830
on their boss’s meeting.

616
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,040
- What does he mean?
- Is that your so-called high-quality service?

617
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,680
So rude! How dare he!

618
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,230
How could that jerk

619
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,520
do this to Qianyu?

620
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,000
So ruthless!

621
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:12,800
Guanmei Inn does have flaws,

622
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:15,760
but we’re doing our best to improve it.

623
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:22,190
Stop wasting my time.

624
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:23,070
Listen,

625
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:25,760
Senwell is going to transform this village,

626
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:27,160
the inn included,

627
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:29,560
to something unimaginable.

628
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:37,190
Hey,

629
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,540
we gotta teach him a lesson,

630
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,190
or he’ll think he can walk all over us.

631
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:42,920
Teach him hard.

632
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:43,680
Let’s go.

633
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,560
Let’s go.

634
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:53,760
Mr. Shan,

635
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:55,830
Guanmei Fishing Village

636
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,190
belongs to each and every one living here.

637
00:31:58,470 --> 00:31:59,230
You have no right

638
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,000
to make decisions for them.

639
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,680
Your so-called reconstruction

640
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,710
will only turn this place

641
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,560
into a resort for tourists.

642
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:08,190
But what about

643
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:09,220
the locals?

644
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,950
They’ve been living here for generations.

645
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,310
This is their home.

646
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:14,190
Who are you?

647
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,880
That doesn’t matter.

648
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,110
What matters is

649
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,000
if Mr. Tang pays off the debt

650
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,350
he owes to Senwell,

651
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:23,190
will that make Guanmei Inn

652
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,190
still his?

653
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,190
If so,

654
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:27,000
I can pay for him.

655
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,560
Taichu.

656
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,430
Taichu?

657
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,950
Are you ITA’s representative, Taichu?

658
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,190
I didn’t expect

659
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:39,830
we’d meet like this.

660
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,910
What are you doing here?

661
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,310
Only by coming here myself

662
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:46,190
can I gain in-depth knowledge

663
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,190
and give an accurate assessment, right?

664
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,830
International Travel Association

665
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,310
is known for its objectiveness

666
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,000
and accuracy.

667
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,470
As GQ’s consultant,

668
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,280
what you said

669
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,590
makes me question your ability and status.

670
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:02,920
Mr. Shan,

671
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,950
other than representing ITA in GQ,

672
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:07,560
I also represent myself.

673
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,280
I’m willing

674
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,640
to clear Mr. Tang’s debt.

675
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:12,840
Drafting and handing in the feasibility report

676
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,010
is my job.

677
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:19,400
Besides,

678
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:21,350
I can tell you with my expertise

679
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,000
that your development plan

680
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,310
doesn’t suit Guanmei.

681
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:26,520
You’re so eager to level this place to rebuild it

682
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:27,880
that you ignored

683
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,590
things worth keeping.

684
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,830
I didn’t see

685
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,680
any attraction here.

686
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,680
What is that you think is worth keeping?

687
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:42,040
It’s true

688
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,880
that this village is in decline

689
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,830
but the legacy is still treasured by the locals

690
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:50,800
and their protection of the sea and their home.

691
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,590
Did you see any of that?

692
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,040
I hope you said that

693
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,190
from an objective view

694
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,110
not for other reasons.

695
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,640
Objective or not, you don’t get to decide.

696
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,230
I’m not working for you.

697
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,560
At least,

698
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:10,600
GQ still acknowledges me.

699
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,040
You’re wrong.

700
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,280
GQ trusts Mr. Shan more.

701
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,360
Or why do you think we’re here?

702
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:23,280
Do your homework before playing the hero.

703
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:26,040
Tang Shunming’s preemptive right

704
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,230
has expired.

705
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:29,390
Even if he had enough money,

706
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:32,190
it’d be too late.

707
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,120
Mr. Tang,

708
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,670
don’t forget,

709
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:41,470
you only have one week.

710
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:55,760
Finished?

711
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,080
Don’t rush me.

712
00:34:59,120 --> 00:34:59,630
Hurry!

713
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,080
Taste this!

714
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,430
Let’s see what they can do.

715
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,470
Yeah!

716
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:28,190
They’re coming.

717
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:30,670
Hello?

718
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:47,040
Be quiet!

719
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:47,950
It hurts.

720
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:51,390
I’m sorry, my bad.

721
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:06,360
What’s wrong with Tonghao?

722
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:08,910
Even if he’s recovered,

723
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:12,670
there’s no need to be that cruel to us.

724
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,230
Why does he hate me so much?

725
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,560
I didn’t lie to him.

726
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,560
Qianyu.

727
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,470
What’s up?

728
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,040
Shan Junhao must’ve done something.

729
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,390
We punctured his tire

730
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,390
but we should’ve done more.

731
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:32,120
Yes!

732
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:33,670
You punctured his tire?

733
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,000
Qianyu, cheer up.

734
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,470
We’ll take revenge for you.

735
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,360
- We’ll let him pay! - Qianyu!

736
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:40,470
Did we say anything wrong?

737
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,600
Why did she rush out?

738
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,560
Let’s go with her.

739
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,150
Let’s go.

740
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,740
Liyin, you stay and watch the inn.

741
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,190
- Yes. - Good luck, guys.

742
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:48,670
OK.

743
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:50,560
Junhao,

744
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:53,040
you didn’t have to come today.

745
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,710
I meant to see the place I lived

746
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:01,900
and people I met

747
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,670
after I had the accident.

748
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:07,190
Turns out they’re as deceitful as Ye Qianyu.

749
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:15,320
But why is Taichu there?

750
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,950
Given his attitude towards Ye Qianyu,

751
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,080
they don’t seem to be just friends.

752
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:27,950
Dawei,

753
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:30,080
find out everything about Taichu

754
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,390
since he came to Guanmei Fishing Village.

755
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,280
Yes.

756
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:36,230
How come the low-pressure signal is on?

757
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:47,490
What’s wrong?

758
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,190
The tire was punctured.

759
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,080
Punctured?

760
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:54,670
They must’ve done it.

761
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,000
I’ll change it.

762
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:01,540
Drive faster.

763
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:06,350
Speed up. They’re right ahead.

764
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,630
Right there. Go, go, go.

765
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:11,670
Over there.

766
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:16,600
There they are.

767
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,080
What brings you here, Chen?

768
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,080
I... I’m here to chop that jerk into pieces.

769
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,470
Aunt Jinzhi, you look intimidating.

770
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,840
Darn right I am!

771
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:33,870
Jinzhi,

772
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:34,560
I knew

773
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:35,700
you’re the big gun.

774
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:36,250
Of course.

775
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:37,800
Guys,

776
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:39,870
he came in with two legs

777
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:41,120
but will leave with none.

778
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:41,950
Let’s go.

779
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,600
Are you alright?

780
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:47,910
You jerk!

781
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,560
You keep getting on my nerves.

782
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,910
What are you doing?

783
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:54,190
Nothing.

784
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:56,800
I’m going to teach that punk a lesson.

785
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:58,120
Mom!

786
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:01,950
I knew you were liars and frauds

787
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,120
but I didn’t know you were mobs, too.

788
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:06,560
You called us mobs?

789
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:07,360
- You... - Stop.

790
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:07,980
Tonghao,

791
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:09,950
we demand an explanation!

792
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,600
Why are you doing this to Qianyu?

793
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,430
Why are you destroying our inn?

794
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,520
Tonghao, you’ve changed.

795
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:17,940
I don’t think your previous kindness is fake.

796
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,630
I’m not Tonghao.

797
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:23,760
I’ll never make friends

798
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,870
with you people.

799
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:28,000
When will you stop pestering Junhao?

800
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:30,670
Do you want money?

801
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:32,150
Name your price.

802
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,040
Shut up!

803
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:34,630
You don’t get to speak here.

804
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,540
If you don’t want to be covered with blood,

805
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,720
then get lost.

806
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:41,290
Your money is nothing to me!

807
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,390
Mom!

808
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:43,640
- Enough. - Mama Jinzhi.

809
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:45,360
Don’t do this.

810
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,080
Easy, guys.

811
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,870
We can talk things out.

812
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:51,760
Mr. Shan,

813
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,760
I can give you a ride out.

814
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,670
Change the tire and leave!

815
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:02,840
OK.

816
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,910
You think you can scare me

817
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,430
with violence?

818
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:12,360
I’m sorry, Mr. Shan.

819
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:15,000
I apologize to you

820
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:16,000
for my mom and the others.

821
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:18,000
We shouldn’t have punctured your tire.

822
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,800
Did you do it?

823
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:23,840
I’m sorry.

824
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:24,870
Ye Qianyu,

825
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,670
stop pretending.

826
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:28,870
Qianyu.

827
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,230
Why did you apologize to him?

828
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:32,430
He abandoned and hurt you.

829
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,600
- Yes. - Yes, Qianyu.

830
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:35,600
Don’t waste time on that jerk.

831
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:36,390
Enough!

832
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:38,390
Be quiet!

833
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,630
He’s Shan Junhao, not Tonghao.

834
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:43,280
He’s forgotten about everything in Guanmei.

835
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:53,840
Since you know who I am,

836
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:57,040
don’t try to fool me with your tricks.

837
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,150
You guys

838
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:01,520
are the most unreasonable

839
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:04,000
and stupid people I’ve ever met.

840
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:06,230
Mama Jinzhi.

841
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:08,770
Hey…

842
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,120
Shan Junhao,

843
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:14,230
I can’t believe

844
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:15,630
you said that.

845
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:18,320
I heard you’re cold and mean

846
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,360
but I never thought you’d be so heartless.

847
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,910
They treat you as their friend

848
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:24,280
and family,

849
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,000
but you don’t deserve it.

850
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:33,080
If you think you can stop me

851
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,840
from developing Guanmei in this way,

852
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,360
you can’t be more wrong.

853
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,320
Mr. Shan,

854
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,760
the tire has been changed.

855
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,040
Mr. Shan,

856
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:45,560
you can leave.

857
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:46,800
I’ll take care of things here.

858
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,190
Let’s go.

859
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:55,060
- You can’t leave. - No.

860
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:56,800
Calm down. Don’t be mad.

861
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:58,460
Lin Donglu, you rat!

862
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,710
Step aside! Get out of the way!

863
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,000
What are you doing? Don’t block us.

864
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:03,190
Enough.

865
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:04,640
Listen to him.

866
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,690
Just go back.

867
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:06,830
But…

868
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:07,670
Qianyu,

869
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,360
you’re letting him go like this?

870
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,430
Fengqiao,

871
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:13,760
from now on,

872
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:15,950
that man

873
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,870
is a total stranger to us.

874
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:25,690
If you could really think so.

875
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:04,910
Junhao,

876
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:06,910
let’s not come here again.

877
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,840
They’re so out of line.

878
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:13,950
Do you also think I’m heartless?

879
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,150
How come?

880
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:16,000
Mr. Shan.

881
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:19,870
Actually, their life is hard.

882
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:22,280
Junhao,

883
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:23,910
don’t believe their words.

884
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,600
They’re unreasonable.

885
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,360
This is the second time

886
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:29,760
I’ve heard that comment today.

887
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:31,280
Mr. Shan,

888
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,950
they only said that because they didn’t know you.

889
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,800
That Shan Junhao I know

890
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,560
never questions himself.
