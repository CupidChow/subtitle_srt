11
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,590
Well, Mr. Shan.

12
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:52,230
You told me to find out

13
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,630
what Taichu is doing in Guanmei Fishing Village.

14
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,160
In these days,

15
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,590
I’ve learned many from them.

16
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,760
Taichu has been there for a long time.

17
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,800
He lives in Guanmei Inn.

18
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,080
They didn’t know

19
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,080
Taichu is Dadao,

20
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,870
nor did they know he represents the ITA.

21
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,080
They thought he was just a tourist.

22
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,720
Taichu gave them lots of help.

23
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,630
He and Tonghao led

24
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,720
the renovation of Guanmei Inn.

25
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,800
Later Tonghao…

26
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,960
You know what happened.

27
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,670
Taichu did all these

28
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,440
most likely

29
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,190
because of Ye Qianyu.

30
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:28,800
That’s why they believe

31
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,880
Chen Jinzhi wants Taichu to marry her daughter,

32
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,470
though Ye Qianyu loves Tonghao

33
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,270
and Tonghao loves Ye Qianyu.

34
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,320
Stay to the wheel.

35
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:46,340
Yes, sir.

36
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,670
Cheers, for the successful negotiation!

37
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,800
Cheers!

38
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,030
Thank you!

39
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:59,720
Well done!

40
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:04,190
All these are credited to Taichu.

41
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,030
Thank you, Taichu.

42
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,320
That’s my job.

43
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:07,860
Come on.

44
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,440
Cabriolet guy, thank you.

45
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:10,960
Yeah!

46
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,720
We owe Taichu a thank you

47
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,550
for saving Guanmei Inn.

48
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,190
It was a team work.

49
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,110
Taichu,

50
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,270
now you’ve taken the place of Tonghao.

51
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,630
That’s indeed an embarrassment.

52
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,630
It’s fine.

53
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,190
In the month to come,

54
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,830
let’s fight hard hand in hand.

55
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:40,600
Hand in hand, hand in hand.

56
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:44,110
Come on, don’t waste the food.

57
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:45,110
Come on, eat.

58
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:45,600
Come on.

59
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,550
It’s yummy.

60
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:47,080
Eat more.

61
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,000
Have more.

62
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,390
Cabriolet guy, eat more.

63
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,580
- Enjoy yourself. - I recommend this.

64
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,440
Enjoy yourself.

65
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:51,880
Yummy.

66
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,000
Master made all these delicacies.

67
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,960
Don’t let him down.

68
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,720
- If anything is left, - Good, good.

69
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,910
nobody can leave.

70
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:57,600
Enjoy yourselves.

71
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,240
Yes.

72
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:58,880
Got it.

73
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,430
A toast to Master!

74
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,360
Come on! It’s yummy!

75
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:05,960
This is good.

76
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,900
- Go on. Go on. - Have some shrimp.

77
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:08,800
It’s superb.

78
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,670
Seems Tang and Chen get along well.

79
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,750
This is nice.

80
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,960
Will they start one more fight?

81
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:17,110
Impossible!

82
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:18,390
Yummy!

83
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:25,830
Jinzhi,

84
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,720
are you taking me here

85
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,270
Cheers!

86
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,480
for a talk?

87
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,200
Cheers!

88
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,320
Cheers! Cheers!

89
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,270
I want you to know

90
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,480
I don’t like the way Shan Junhao

91
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,350
treated Qianyu

92
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,670
in Senwell.

93
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:49,070
That is the point?

94
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,070
Yes.

95
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,230
I’ll help you.

96
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,160
That’s his way,

97
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,110
as cold as ice.

98
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,320
Enjoy it!

99
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,350
Actually I didn’t expect he approved

100
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,320
I wanna more of that.

101
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,790
our proposal.

102
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,200
I’m afraid Shan Junhao

103
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,230
would hurt Qianyu again.

104
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,450
- It’s great! - Yummy!

105
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:08,490
Have more!

106
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,550
My silly girl, Qianyu…

107
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:11,930
Come on,

108
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:12,610
Sis.

109
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,760
that’s their business.

110
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,510
They’ll handle it.

111
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,600
You don’t understand.

112
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,790
Anyway,

113
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:27,000
Qianyu has Taichu with her.

114
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,670
He’ll help her forget Tonghao.

115
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,510
Are you using him…

116
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,720
How could you use a man

117
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,350
to forget another man?

118
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,300
- What do you think Qianyu is?
- I want that. Help me, please.

119
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,950
- You don’t understand, butterball!
- Here you are.

120
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:44,880
Think about it.

121
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,510
Qianyu is a blooming rose.

122
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,790
She can’t waste time.

123
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,350
Look at Taichu.

124
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,550
Look at him.

125
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,600
I did.

126
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,720
He’s smart,

127
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,720
he’s gifted,

128
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,070
and above all,

129
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:01,040
he’s rich.

130
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,320
All you have in mind are money,

131
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,320
space and new romance.

132
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,140
Whatever you like.

133
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,350
Chen Jinzhi, you are

134
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:09,550
a playgirl.

135
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,070
You play around

136
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,640
and wanna corrupt Qianyu?

137
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,110
What did you say?

138
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:16,000
I play around?

139
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,160
You do, don’t you?

140
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,670
That’s the truth, Chen Jinzhi.

141
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,600
Dare you say it again?

142
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,160
You… You just play around.

143
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,380
Dare you say it again?

144
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,660
And you use the grocery

145
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,880
as a pretext for playing around.

146
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,350
What?

147
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:27,920
What do you mean?

148
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,790
- They… They’ve told me everything.
- What were you told,

149
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:30,820
and who told you?

150
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:31,420
Let them be.

151
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,230
- That Chen… - Let them be.

152
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,510
They’ve been doing this for decades.

153
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,510
They’re too excited.

154
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,480
Come on.

155
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,350
I’ve seen something worse.

156
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:38,070
Try this.

157
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,000
This. It’s good.

158
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,600
This is good.

159
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,950
- Come on! - Cheers!

160
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,580
Cheers!

161
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,390
You’ll get a stroke.

162
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,790
You’re giving me a stroke!

163
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:46,920
Do get it!

164
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,720
Please!

165
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,480
Mom, I’m back.

166
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,950
What kept you so late?

167
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:55,640
Guanmei Fishing Village.

168
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,880
Why did you go there?

169
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,000
I went to see Dawei.

170
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,070
Dawei?

171
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,760
Why is Dawei in Guanmei?

172
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,270
When he went to close down Guanmei Inn,

173
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,790
he fell down and was hurt.

174
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,040
He had to stay there.

175
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,510
Really?

176
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:22,940
Hmm.

177
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,510
Is it serious?

178
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,600
Not really.

179
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:27,830
He’s back now.

180
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,760
But

181
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,510
why didn’t he

182
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,640
tell you in the first place?

183
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,510
Maybe he was tired

184
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,110
and slacked off.

185
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,230
It’s good he’s fine.

186
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:45,950
We don’t have to worry.

187
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,830
Are you hungry?

188
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:48,880
Have dinner.

189
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:49,740
OK.

190
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:50,510
Have dinner.

191
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,320
How did you get in?

192
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,670
Isn’t the code Fan Yunyi’s birthday?

193
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,950
You came uninvited

194
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,350
just to verify the access code?

195
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,350
Good wine.

196
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,320
Speak your words.

197
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,480
I pity you.

198
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,350
I’ve warned you.

199
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,670
Chairman Xu transferred equity to Shan Yaolong.

200
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,320
That is unusual.

201
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,150
You didn’t believe me.

202
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,710
Go to the point.

203
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,110
My point is

204
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:49,030
Shan Yaolong forced Chairman Xu

205
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,350
to transfer the equity.

206
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,440
Minghan,

207
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:56,400
don’t expect this would

208
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,150
cast in a bone between Junhao and me.

209
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,550
My father has a noble heart.

210
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,230
In his heart, fame and fortune

211
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,030
are far next to friendship

212
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,350
and freedom.

213
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:10,590
He and Uncle Shan were like brothers.

214
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,320
He volunteered the equity transfer.

215
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,400
Voluntary transfer,

216
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,440
as Shan Yaolong claimed.

217
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,840
Your father and Shan Yaolong

218
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,640
were never friends.

219
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,840
Your father insisted on

220
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,590
investing in Dongdao Finance and failed.

221
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,550
Shan Yaolong hated him

222
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,230
and wanted to kick him out.

223
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,230
You’re never in the know.

224
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:43,110
Facts speak louder than words.

225
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,880
I’ll show you the proof.

226
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:52,710
Yifeng,

227
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,110
you must sign it now.

228
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:57,150
I admit

229
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,280
investing in Dongdao Finance was my fault.

230
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:01,200
But are you kicking me out

231
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:01,880
because of this?

232
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,590
You know it,

233
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,790
I contributed the most part of Senwell’s

234
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,000
initial capital.

235
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:08,910
I am the father of Senwell.

236
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,710
You did contribute the most part

237
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:13,760
of the initial capital.

238
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,670
But as the chairman,

239
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,080
you made terrible decisions

240
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,790
that caused heavy losses.

241
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,840
Dongdao Finance alone

242
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,670
cost the company 300 million.

243
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,320
The loss must be fixed,

244
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,550
or Senwell is ruined in your hand.

245
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,440
Since you can bring money

246
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,840
to save Senwell from the crisis,

247
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:39,000
why do I have to go?

248
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,280
You forgot the vow we took

249
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,910
when we three started up?

250
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,790
We’re in the same boat.

251
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,150
You don’t deserve

252
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,760
to be in the boat with us.

253
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,790
You’re in our way.

254
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,230
If you don’t want to

255
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,350
doom everything we’ve gained,

256
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,200
sign it.

257
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,590
There is no alternative.

258
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,470
Yaolong, I didn’t know you’re so cruel.

259
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:06,840
Don’t you always dream to travel the globe?

260
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:07,980
Go do it.

261
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:10,280
That’s the right thing for you.

262
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,150
You are not a good

263
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,470
decision maker.

264
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,200
Fine.

265
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:17,140
I’ll sign it.

266
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,710
The recording,

267
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,280
where did you get it?

268
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:24,350
My father kept it.

269
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:29,200
I found it from his safe box.

270
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:33,320
My father saw the signing,

271
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,200
and made the recording.

272
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,400
He thought it was unfair

273
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:41,230
and secretly recorded the whole thing.

274
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,440
Zhang Minghan,

275
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,640
I know what you want.

276
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,590
You fabricated all these

277
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,790
because you want to

278
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,670
kick Shan Junhao out of general manager’s office.

279
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,230
You want to break us up

280
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,230
and planned everything.

281
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:16,400
Up to now,

282
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,710
you still don’t trust me, do you?

283
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,350
It’s your father’s talking.

284
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:21,470
Didn’t you hear that?

285
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,550
The brotherhood

286
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:26,880
is fragile.

287
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,910
Shan Yaolong took your father’s equity.

288
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,350
You should thank me

289
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,030
for telling the truth.

290
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,880
Yeah, you’re right.

291
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,670
I want to kick Shan Junhao

292
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,000
out of general manager’s office.

293
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:44,320
I don’t deny.

294
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:48,000
Zhang Minghan does everything above board.

295
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,640
I fight for anything

296
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,790
I'm going to obtain in just ways.

297
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:53,910
I am the one

298
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:56,320
who can make Senwell better.

299
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,590
I happened to know this.

300
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,440
I told you because

301
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,550
we grew up together.

302
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,320
If all these couldn’t convince you…

303
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,110
Xu Ziqian,

304
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,520
you’re fooling yourself.

305
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:20,840
I have a copy of this.

306
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,960
Take and verify it.

307
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:42,470
Who owns Dongdao Finance?

308
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,400
Dongdao Finance’s boss

309
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,000
is a close friend of your father’s.

310
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,670
Your father trusted him

311
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,200
and rejected Shan Yaolong’s objection

312
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,280
and made investment in his own name.

313
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,590
That man made off with the loot.

314
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,760
It was a heavy punch on Senwell.

315
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,520
Though your father was to be blamed,

316
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,640
he did not have to go.

317
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,960
Shan Yaolong threatened your father

318
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,000
to give up all.

319
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,840
He wanted power

320
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,470
and profits

321
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,790
at the expense of the brotherhood.

322
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:32,710
In the crisis,

323
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,640
he gave your father no support

324
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,710
but a final push.

325
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,640
He’s a snake, isn’t he?

326
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,150
Are you finished?

327
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:03,520
Ziqian,

328
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,200
your father spent all of his life on this.

329
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,320
It should have been yours.

330
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,200
What do you have now?

331
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,080
You’re serving the Shans,

332
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,440
in the name of a little director.

333
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,280
I think it’s unfair.

334
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:21,840
Tell me,

335
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,350
do you still want to protect them?

336
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:29,760
Get out!

337
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:35,670
I know

338
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,840
you never fight for anything.

339
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:40,840
I admire this.

340
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:44,000
But we don’t have to

341
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,280
tolerate a snake.

342
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,030
Get out!

343
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,180
Taichu,

344
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,000
you taught them well.

345
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,470
Someone else

346
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,840
taught Qianyu negotiation skills before me.

347
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:56,670
It was Tonghao.

348
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:27,590
Tonghao…

349
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,070
Don’t give me that look again.

350
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,830
I’m not Tonghao.

351
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:48,350
Yifeng,

352
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,760
you must sign it now.

353
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,560
I admit

354
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,430
investing in Dongdao Finance was my fault.

355
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,920
But are you kicking me out

356
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,110
because of this?

357
00:17:58,830 --> 00:17:59,470
You know it,

358
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,070
I contributed the most part of Senwell’s

359
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,400
initial capital.

360
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,590
I am the father of Senwell.

361
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:06,950
You did contribute the most part

362
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,040
of the initial capital.

363
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,880
But as the chairman,

364
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:13,430
you made terrible decisions

365
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:16,000
that caused heavy losses.

366
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,040
Since you can bring money

367
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,560
to save Senwell from the crisis,

368
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,560
why do I have to go?

369
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,560
Dongdao Finance alone

370
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:26,190
cost the company 300 million.

371
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,830
The loss must be fixed,

372
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,110
or Senwell is ruined in your hand.

373
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,470
You forgot the vow we took

374
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:36,920
when we three started up?

375
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:40,110
We’re in the same boat.

376
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,430
You don’t deserve

377
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,110
to be in the boat with us.

378
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,070
You’re in our way.

379
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,470
If you don’t want to

380
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,640
doom everything we’ve gained,

381
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:52,520
sign it.

382
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:54,830
There is no alternative.

383
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:59,430
Don’t you always dream to travel the globe?

Go do it.

That’s the right thing for you.

386
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,950
You are not a good

387
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,110
decision maker.

388
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,160
Yifeng, you must sign it now.

389
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,190
You did contribute the most part

390

of the initial capital.

391
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,040
But as the chairman,

392
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,520
you made terrible decisions

393
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:23,110
that caused heavy losses.

394
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,830
Dongdao Finance alone

395
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,520
cost the company 300 million.

396
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,160
The loss must be fixed,

397
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,280
or Senwell will be ruined in your hand.

398
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,070

399
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,920
to be in the boat with us.

Director Xu isn’t home.

419

Search where he often shows up.

420
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:04,680
Yes, Mr. Shan.

421
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,070
I’ll call him.

Didn’t answer.

425

Mr. Shan.

Found Director Xu?

Xu Ziqian, what are you doing?

431
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,800
Mr. Shan, shall we call the police?

432
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,800
Not necessary.

433
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,800
Ziqian,

434

where were you?

435
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,760
We were worried about you.

436
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,680
Just a slack-off.

437
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,230
I was exhausted.

438
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,400
Director Xu.

439
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,640
Are you still drunk?

440
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:24,950
I’m sorry, Mr. Shan.

441
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,560
At least you’re alright.

Why didn’t you answer the phone?

445
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,110

Do not do that again.

451
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:45,800
Yes, I promise.

00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:50,400
Alright,

Come to your seat.

when I was absent.

459

Key departments were re-staffed.

The new employees

461
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,190
follow Zhang Minghan’s lead.

462
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,160
There came problems.

463
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:23,560
Departments blame each other,

464
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,110
work efficiency is low,

465
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:28,400
and project progress lagged behind.

466
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:31,230
I suggest the old employees
return to their positions

467
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,880
and restore the order.

468
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,070
Director Xu,

469
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,280
you’ll take care of this.

470
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:43,520

00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,430
recent staff changes,

472
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,400
and systematically evaluate

473
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,880
those on the list.

474

Mr. Shan,

475
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,680

476
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,400
to a very little director,

477
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,310
are you sure?

478
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:03,190
Director Xu,

479
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,310
be serious.

480
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,040
In Senwell,

481
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,640

482
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,110
you and Director Fan.

483
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,640
There will be more burdens on you.

484
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,110
Any question?

485
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:32,830
No.

486
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:36,110
You’ll take care of this.

487
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,520

She worries about you.

491
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,190
I will.

492
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,190
Wait.

493
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,110
Next time you want a drink,

494
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,110
come to me.

495
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:30,110
Do not mess yourself up again.

496
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:36,340
Sure.

499

We must show him something

How shall we prove ourselves?

502
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:17,280
The biggest problem is low visitor flow.

503
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,000
We must have sustained increase of visitor flow

504
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,310
before lifting the inn’s performance

505
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,680
to a new high.

506
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:26,760
The best way to attract visitors is advertising.

507
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:30,160
But that’s very expensive.

508
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:31,640

515
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:15,400
to attract large visitor flow in a short time.

516
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,950
When Tonghao was here,

517
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,920
we planned the first Tourism and Culture Festival,

518

Now

520
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,470
we could take the chance of

521
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,400
the Taurus meteor shower

522
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,830
to redesign the Tourism and Culture Festival.

523
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,590
The best place to view the meteor shower

524
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:33,430
is Guanmei Fishing Village.

525
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,830
This is a God-blessed opportunity.

526

And

527
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:37,780
we can invite some celebrities

528
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,740
to the village.

529
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,500
They’ll attract attention to our inn.

530

531
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,590
the only celebrity I know

532
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:46,590
is Chen.

533
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,710
She monopolizes the drinking water supply

534
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,190
in Guanmei Fishing Village.

535
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:52,470
Don’t worry.

536
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,560
I’ll handle this.

537
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,280
Are you sure?

538
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,590
So,

539
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,470
Shan Junhao will see we’re working hard

540
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,640
and agree we run Guanmei Inn.

541
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,520

What’s it?

545
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,800
The Tourism and Culture Festival is an event

546
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,190
to publicize Guanmei Fishing Village.

547
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,680
It will promote the culture of the village

548
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,590
and bring more tourists.

549
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,880
Guanmei Inn

550
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,560
will be the organizer.

551
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,070
The festival on one hand

552
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,560
will bring Guanmei to the public,

553
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,310
on the other,

554
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,040
will improve its visibility.

555
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:30,760
When we get ready for it,

556
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:32,760
I’ll put this on my Weibo

557
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,680
and share the event with more people.

558
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,760
Taichu will also

559
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,310
invite the media professionals.

560
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,160
We’ll carefully receive them.

561
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,430
If they are happy,

562
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,470
they will help us through media.

563
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,640
More visitors will come

564
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,520
to Guanmei.

565
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,000
The Tourism and Culture Festival is a big event.

566
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,760
But we have only a week.

567
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:58,230
We will take care of the media professionals

568
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:00,000
and make all visitors know

569
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,350
how great Guanmei Inn is.

570
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,520
That’s to say,

571
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,190
we have to work hand in hand.

572
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:12,680
Actually, I have no idea
what they were talking about,

573
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:15,560
but Taichu is always right

574
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,640
and we’ll do as he says.

575
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,190
Yeah.

576
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,280
Let’s move it!

577
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,560
Move it!

578
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,880
Go, go, go!

579
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:23,280
Go, go, go!

580
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,160
Hello,

581
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,110
this is Guanmei Inn.

582
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:26,590
I need you to design

583
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:27,280
Guanmei Fishing Village’s first…

584
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,880
I worked out a list of we media.

585
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,280
I need you to contact them now.

586
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,760
I’ll email you the information you need.

587
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,470
Qianyu,

588
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,680
I worked out a menu for the meteor dinner.

589
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,640
Check it out.

590
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,070
The appetizer is oily.

591
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,040
The soup is plain.

592
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:38,950
Redo it.

593
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:40,060
Yes.

594
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:42,920
Taichu,

595
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:45,430
I’ll pick up Shengzhe at school.

596
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,430
Check this for me.

597
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:47,110
I’ll be back soon.

598
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:47,590
OK.

599
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,000
Qianyu,

600
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:49,950
you have job to do.

601
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,470
I’ll go.

602
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:11,830
Watch out!

603
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:17,070
That won’t kill me.

604
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,430
Tang,

605
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,520
I’ve been waiting for six years

606
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,560
before you came to me.

607
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:31,880
Shengzhe,

608
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,000
I owe you a lot.

609
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,160
Don’t try to steal my hair!

610
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,470
What are you doing?

611
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:42,920
I’ve been expecting you to steal my hair,

612
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:45,560
and you came when I’m having beard.

613
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:46,940
What…

614
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,800
What do I have to take your hair for?

615
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,190
You can’t fool me.

616
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,520
You want my hair

617
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,400
for the DNA test.

618
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:56,760
I don’t need the DNA test.

619
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:59,760
I’m sure you’re my own son.

620
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,350
Have you given me pocket money?

621
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,070
Do you know which class I’m in?

622
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:05,160
You failed your duties.

623
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,430
I won’t call you dad.

624
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:07,590
No!

625
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:12,230
Shengzhe,

626
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:13,260
wait.

627
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:23,160
Shengzhe,

628
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,400
your meal!

629
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:29,230
You need something good.

630
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,430
You’re growing.

631
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:36,880
Let me do it for you.

632
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,400
It’s OK.

633
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:56,920
Try it.

634
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:01,640
Yummy?

635
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:04,920
Overcooked.

636
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,680
Overcooked?

637
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,880
Next time I’ll do it better.

638
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:13,430
There’s no next time. I’m thirsty.

639
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:14,160
Thirsty?

640
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,350
Yes, yes.

641
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,070
Orange juice,

642
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,040
drink it.

643
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,400
That’s mine…

644
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:25,760
Tang,

645
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:28,430
You didn’t take him back to the grocery

646
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:30,160
just because of the steak?

647
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,070
He…

648
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,400
He’s a child.

649
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:45,880
Here,

650
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,590
eat it.

651
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,760
Mr. Ziqian.

652
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:01,400
Ziqian,

653
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:03,430
why are you so late?

654
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:04,310
Do you know

655
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,000
I worried about you?

656
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:07,760
Where were you?

657
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:13,920
Ziqian,

658
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:15,800
what happened?

659
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:18,920
Aunt Jiang, I’m fine.

660
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,590
I dropped my phone,

661
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:21,470
and couldn’t reach you.

662
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:24,920
I have some

663
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:26,760
caviar from France.

664
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:28,230
Your favorite.

665
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:30,190
Good boy,

666
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,800
sweeter than my own son.

667
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:35,160
Junhao never knows

668
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,040
what my favorite is.

669
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,880
I have similar feeling.

670
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,230
Mom loves Ziqian more than loves me.

671
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,680
That’s true.

672
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,430
Ziqian grew up in Shan’s family.

673
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:48,040
He’s good and sweet.

674
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,350
He never let me down.

675
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:50,430
I do love him.

676
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:53,310
Alright, rivals,

677
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:54,350
dinner is ready.

678
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,280
Dinner time.

679
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:55,950
OK.

680
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,520
Ziqian, eat more.

681
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:05,880
Eat more.

682
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:10,430
You don’t look well.

683
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,600
Do you need rest?

684
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,630
I’m fine.

685
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:17,360
Have a good rest.

686
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:19,390
You’ll have one day leave tomorrow.

687
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,560
Mr. Shan proposes a rest?

688
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:24,190
It’s rare!

689
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,600
Thank you, Mr. Shan.

690
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:30,470
Come on, children,

691
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,630
there’s no need to call him Mr. Shan at home.

692
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,230
Aunt Jiang,

693
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:42,000
may I ask you a question?

694
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:43,520
Go ahead.

695
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:48,630
Why did my father

696
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:52,040
give up his shares in Senwell

697
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:53,910
to travel around the world?

698
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,870
Your father snubbed fame and fortune.

699
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:12,320
Traveling with your mother around the world

700
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,360
was his dream.

701
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,190
We’re all sorry

702
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,320
for the accident.

703
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:27,710
Fortunately you’re alright.

704
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:30,280
Ziqian,

705
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:34,560
why did you ask this?

706
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:40,320
I just dreamed of them last night,

707
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:43,150
and want to know something about them.

708
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:45,800
I was too young when they were gone.

709
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:52,190
Your father and mother were nice people.

710
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,760
Your uncle and I

711
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:57,430
appreciate the friendship

712
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:00,280
with your parents.

713
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:02,800
They were gone

714
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:05,840
at such a young age.

715
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,670
Aunt Jiang, it’s OK.

716
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,800
Uncle Shan

717
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,360
seldom mentioned this.

718
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,080
Your father and your uncle,

719
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,760
like Junhao and you,

720
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,000
were like brothers.

721
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,630
They never had a fight.

722
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,800
They were the best friends

723
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,870
and the best partners.

724
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,280
Ziqian,

725
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,840
you’re always my son,

726
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:58,840
and here is always your home.

727
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,950
Yes, Aunt Jiang.

728
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:10,390
Mom, Ziqian,

729
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:12,430
the dinner is getting cold.

730
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,360
Yeah, the dinner.

731
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:30,760
Qianyu,

732
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,630
what on the list are
our media guests who have

733
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:33,710
confirmed their presence.

734
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:38,430
Those I contacted are all agreed to come!

735
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:44,840
Why is Princess Snow not on it?

736
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,910
I watch all her programs!

737
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,320
She recommends the best foods

738
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,360
and homestays!

739
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:55,430
Why she’s not coming?

740
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,360
Don’t you know each other?

741
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,150
Maybe she declined because

742
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,430
I invited her.

743
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:03,520
Why?

744
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,520
It’s OK.

745
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,040
You’ve helped a lot.

746
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:15,800
Anyway,

747
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:18,630
how could we bring her here?

748
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,040
If she comes,

749
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:22,760
our festival is already

750
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,360
50 percent successful.

751
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,670
That’s true.

752
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,870
Of those on the list,

753
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:30,800
she is the most helpful.

754
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:58,280
It’s cold at night.

755
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,390
Cold is dangerous to kids.

756
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,230
You’re busy,

757
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:05,280
and don’t have time for him.

758
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,280
I’ll take him home now.

759
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,520
Good, good.

760
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,280
Take Shengzhe home now.

761
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:13,150
Well,

762
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,630
you’d better call it a day.

763
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:16,910
Leave the work to tomorrow.

764
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:17,910
Good night.

765
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:30,000
Did you notice

766
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,040
Tang is different with Shengzhe?

767
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:34,950
I did.

768
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,470
OK, whatever.

769
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,000
I’ll take Shengzhe home.

770
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:43,950
As for Princess Snow,

771
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:44,870
we’ll handle this tomorrow.

772
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,670
OK, I’ll see you out.

773
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,820
= Senwell Post Relocation =

774
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,190
Director,

775
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,280
will Mr. Shan approve

776
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:00,630
the re-staffing plan?

777
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:03,670
Why?

778
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:05,760
Mr. Zhang replaced

779
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,040
many old employees

780
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:09,190
whom Mr. Shan trusts.

781
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:11,630
Since we’re helping Mr. Shan,

782
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,840
I suppose they should resume their posts,

783
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,760
or be promoted.

784
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,430
Why does the list say

785
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,470
they are demoted?

786
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,360
You noticed the loyalty they want you to notice.

787
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,040
You didn’t read their minds.

788
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,120
Do as I told you.

789
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,470
Make a list of

790
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:37,320
the vacancies,

791
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:39,280
and send it to HR.

792
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:40,950
The recruits will

793
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,910
be interviewed by me.

794
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,800
Yes, director.

795
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,360
What shall we do?

796
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,600
Shall we invite her in person?

797
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:07,630
Okay.

798
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,150
But we have to get ready for this.

799
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,230
Think what we can do

800
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:12,360
to change her mind,

801
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,910
or it’ll make no difference.

802
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,710
That’s easy!

803
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:20,230
Maybe she wants you.

804
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:22,190
Show her your charm.

805
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:23,320
What do you think?

806
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:27,470
Fengqiao, that’s not even an idea.

807
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,710
Tonghao said

808
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:30,560
know yourself and know your target.

809
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,870
We must know what she really wants

810
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:34,520
before finding the right way.

811
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:35,840
Yeah,

812
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,800
if Tonghao was here,

813
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,390
he would do that.

814
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,840
Tonghao also said

815
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,910
don’t give up at crisis

816
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:47,710
and you’ll find hope in desperate situation.

817
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:51,800
Master is right.

818
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:54,150
Listen,

819
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:55,040
every one of us,

820
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,950
check her social circle.

821
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:57,710
We need her information.

822
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,390
Do it now.

823
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:59,120
We’re running out of time.

824
00:41:59,120 --> 00:41:59,470
Now!

825
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:00,800
