Yunyi!

Gary.

14
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:28,670
Found her?

15
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:30,690
I pulled up the surveillance video.

16
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:32,990
Director Fan left alone

17
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:33,880
after the accident.

18
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,410
There’s good news, though.

19
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,790
Her eyes seem to have recovered.

20
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:41,630
I see.

21
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,000

23
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,670
Hello, Qianyu?

24
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,440
Hello, Taichu?

25
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,160
Did you leave?

26
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,360
I’m sorry.

27
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,320
Your trip is delayed because of me.

28
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,000
So, you aren’t going with me?

29
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,360
I...

30
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,360
Let’s talk in person.

31
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,190
The arch wouldn’t collapse itself.

32
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,520
That girl must’ve done it.

33
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,270
Don’t think the worst of her.

34
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,670
She saved me.

35
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,520
She made a huge scene

36
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,100
in front of everyone.

37
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,110
Don’t you know we already have enough scandals?

38
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,360
This isn’t a scandal.

39
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,160
Can’t you accept Qianyu?

40
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,000
Never!

41
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,670
Yunyi is missing.

42
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,670
Don’t you worry about her at all?

43
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,390
Any news?

44
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,120
I called everyone.

45
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,080
None of them know where Director Fan is.

46
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,520
The surveillance tape shows

47
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,960
she left the hotel alone

48
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,390
without bringing anything.

49
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,510
She’s all alone

50
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:38,150
and can’t see anything.

51
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,550
Where could she go?

52
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:43,390
Ziqian might have the answer.

53
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,000
Director Xu is looking for her, too.

54
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,320
But no news yet.

55
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,350
Get more people on the job.

56
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,880
You must find her!

57
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:51,790
Go!

58
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:52,620
Yes.

59
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,920
I think

60
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,440
you’ve had the answer.

61
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,880
I’m sorry, Taichu.

62
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,950
There’s no right or wrong in love

63
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,640
but only yes or no.

64
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,210
I can’t go with you.

65
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,120
I spent most of my life

66
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,590
on the way.

67
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,720
I never stopped

68
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,290
for anyone.

69
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:46,950
Nor was I ever

70
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,300
possessive

71
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,790
until I met you.

72
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,300
Thank you for driving me back.

73
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:05,020
Sometimes, I don’t know what I’m thinking.

74
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,350
But

75
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,390
you always understand me.

76
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,600
If there were another chance,

77
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,230
we might already

78
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:21,000
be in another country.

79
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,720
I fantasized a million times

80
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,230
about exploring the world with you.

81
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,510
Now,

82
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,440
that’ll only be a fantasy.

83
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,300
I’m really sorry.

84
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,550
It’s OK.

85
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,510
Actually, there’s one thing

86
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,040
I’ve kept from you.

87
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:59,200
What is it?

88
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,070
It was probably because of me

89
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:06,950
that Xu Ziqian found Tonghao.

90
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,440
You knew Tonghao’s real identity long ago?

91
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,070
No.

92
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:18,300
I didn’t suspect anything

93
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,110
until I saw him at the party.

94
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,460
Your classmate party, remember?

95
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,600
Didn’t you have an important meeting

96
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,390
that day?

97
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,070
Yes.

98
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,230
I left early and came back

99
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,260
to surprise you,

100
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,270
but I was still too late.

101
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,510
Actually, I knew

102
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,920
even if you hadn’t told Xu Ziqian,

103
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,640
Tonghao would go back sooner or later.

104
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,670
After he left,

105
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,920
you two met again.

106
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:05,950
I guess

107
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,640
that’s fate.

108
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:31,950
Come on.

109
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,670
Let me drive you back.

110
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:39,100
No need. I can go back myself.

111
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,150
I want to give you one last ride.

112
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:46,320
OK?

113
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,810
- Didn’t you have it yesterday? - It’s so good.

114
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:13,980
Be serious!

115
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:16,310
- Yeah. - Let’s go home.

118
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,590
Since you’ve decided to stay,

119
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,550
I’ll also stay for now.

120
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,660
I want to finish
the development project of Guanmei

121
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,200
to build a better village for you.

122
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:23,880
Thank you, Taichu.

123

124

may I hug you?

00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:03,210
Goodbye.

127
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,200
why are you back?

128
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,710
Where’s Taichu?

129
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,000
Didn’t he come back with you?

130
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,150
Did you miss your flight?

131
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,390
What’s wrong with your head?

132
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,680
Mom, I’m tired.

133
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,660
Isn’t this Yunyi’s veil?

00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,460
Yunyi!

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,550
Is Yunyi back?

142

Miss Yunyi?

143
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:30,760
She isn’t back yet.

= Money Bag Grocery =
What the hell is wrong with you this time?

146
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,200
There was an easy way right in front of you

147
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,640
yet you took

148
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,350
the tough one.

149
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,200
Where did you

150
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,260
get your foolishness from?

151
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,390
I probably got that from you.

152
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,270
When my dad passed away,

153
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,790
you could’ve abandoned me,

154
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,400
but

155
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,760
you stayed to look after me

156
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:09,470
and paid my dad’s debts.

157
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,200
What was wrong with you?

158
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:17,620
You... I don’t know what to say.

160
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,180
makes one laugh and cry.

Qianyu,

162
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,340
have you made up your mind?

163
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,260
Being with Shan Junhao

164
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,740
isn’t easy.

165
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:45,690
Mom, will you blame me?

166
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:47,900
I wish I could,

167
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,700
but I just can’t.

168
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:53,740
Qianyu,

169
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,380
you have to be fully prepared

170
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:58,790
for the difficulties ahead.

171
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,840
Poor Taichu.

172
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:10,940
I know.

173
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,230
But,

174
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,340
given that he could still drive you back,

175
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,840
he’s a real gentleman.

176
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,400
I’m sure

177
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,350
he’ll find

178
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:24,030
his happiness.

181
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:33,710
Yes.

182
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:35,300
When we got back,

183
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,470
this veil was outside the house,

184
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,050
but she isn’t at home.

185
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,730
How come you didn’t see her?

186
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:42,480
I’m sorry. I was inside the whole time.

187
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,720
I didn’t know she was right outside.

188
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,710
She was back already

189
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,110
but why didn’t she come in?

190
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,200
How could she?

191
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,280
You know how devastated she was?

192
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,590
Has any of you

193
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:56,940
ever truly cared about her feelings?

194
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,350
Ziqian...

195
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,550
What’s wrong with him?

196
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,740
He never gave me that attitude.

197
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,400
Maybe Mr. Ziqian

198
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,840
is too worried about Miss Yunyi

199
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,110
to stay calm.

200
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,200
Yunyi...

201
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,910
Where did she go?

202
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,330
She has no money or phone,

203
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,350
and she still can’t see.

204
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:31,790
She...

205
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,080
Mrs. Shan,

206
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,320
don’t worry too much.

207
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,230
Perhaps

208
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,670
she simply wants to be alone for a while.

209
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,220
She may be back tomorrow.

210
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,420
How did things end up like this?

211
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:45,790
Mr. Shan,

212
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,940
I’ve had them checked the scene.

213
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,180
It seems that the arch fell by accident.

214
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,760
But given the direction it collapsed,

215
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,200
it’s most likely to be prearranged.

216
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:00,670
Looks like

217
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:02,670
I was the real target.

218
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:06,110
I’m vetting those who decorated the hall

219
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:08,350
but they all work for Senwell.

220
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:09,850
I don’t think they had the gut to do that.

221
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:13,280
Someone must’ve plotted it secretly.

222
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,820
Don’t leak a word out.

223
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,220
Tell others

224
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,710
it’s an accident.

225
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,110
Yes. I’ll continue the investigation in secret.

226
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,020
Have you found Yunyi?

227
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,310
Not yet.

228
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,950
When I drove Mrs. Shan home,

229
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:35,110
we found Yunyi might’ve been back earlier.

230
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:38,830
But there’s no sign of her now.

231
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,000
Another thing is...

232
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,430
What?

233
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,260
The surveillance tape in the hotel shows

234
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,540
that Yunyi was in bad shape.

235
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,980
But given the way she walked,

236
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,100
she might’ve regained her vision.

237
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,430
Don’t be too nervous.

238
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,940
I’ve called the police

239
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,520
but the case can only be placed on file

240
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,310
after 24 hours.

241
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:12,950
Keep searching.

242
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,180
You must find her.

243
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:15,830
Yes.

244
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,380

- Good. Bravo! - Great!

259
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,490
- It was beautiful, wasn’t it? - Yeah.

260
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,560
- Let’s go. Come on. - Thanks.

261
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,290
- We should leave. - Let’s go.

262
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:06,800
Sure.

263
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:09,900
What did I say?

264
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,180
Let’s continue the walk.

265
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:19,430
- Come on. - It’s late already.

266
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:21,340
Come on.

267
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,160
More beer.

268
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,470
Wow!

269
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,560
A hot bride. Look!

270
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,920
What? Another runaway bride?

271
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,840
Why are you still out at this hour?

272
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:41,410
- Hey, pretty, let’s drink together.
- What are you doing?

273
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,560
- Leave her alone. - What’s bothering you?

274
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,330
Go away!

275
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,260
What’s troubling you?

276
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,670
- Beer can fix everything.
- Get lost! Don’t touch her!

277
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,430
Stay away from her! Stop!

278
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,340
- What? Piss off! - Who the hell are you?

279
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,230
Leave now!

280
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:52,880
Go!

281
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,470
I don’t hit chicks.

282
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,220
- Ignore her. - Let’s go.

283
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,030
She’s crazy.

284
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,920
- Let’s drink. - Ignore them.

285
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,560
Are you OK?

286
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,900
Go home.

287
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,160
It’s dangerous to be out alone at night.

288
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,990
I’m homeless.

289
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:12,000
What about friends?

290
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,220
Call them to pick you up.

291
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,600
I have nothing.

292
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,880
You’re likely to be harassed

293
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,260
in this outfit.

294
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:26,830
You can go to my place.

295
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,220
It’s nearby.

296
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:34,160
Get yourself changed

297
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,420
and eat something.

298
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:42,430
Come on.

299
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,260
Go home after you have some food.

300
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:51,940
Let’s go.

301
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,230
What is this?

302
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:05,620
You must be hungry.

303
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,000
Here.

304
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,800
Eat up.

305
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,020
What’s your name?

306
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,660
Fan Yunyi.

307
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,380
That’s a good name.

308
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,860
I’m Xiaoge. I named myself.

309
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:30,540
You named yourself?

310
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,940
How did your parents name you?

311
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,780
I have no parents.

312
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,760
When I was three,

313
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,710
I was left outside an orphanage.

314
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,920
The director there took me in.

315
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,800
I was short and skinny,

316
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,940
so I was called Xiaoxiao.

317
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:51,980
I wasn’t pretty enough

318
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,950
so nobody adopted me.

319
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,060
When I reached 16,

320
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:58,950
I left there to live on my own.

321
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:00,590
So...

322
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:04,340
Do you hate your parents?

323
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,900
They abandoned me

324
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:11,020
only because they couldn’t raise me.

325
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,350
I don’t hate them.

326
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,500
They gave me life after all.

327
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:17,780
Because of them,

328
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,420
I can enjoy sunshine, sing songs and be happy.

329
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,780
I’m grateful that they brought me to this world.

330
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:32,920
What about you?

331
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,350
Why did you run away from home,

332
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:40,760
and from your wedding?

333
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,360
Actually,

334
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:47,140
my parents also abandoned me.

335
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,500
When I was six,

336
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,980
my mom put me outside a villa.

337
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,060
The couple who owned it adopted me.

338
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,020
They were nice

339
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:08,180
and always wanted me to marry their son.

340
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,340
I thought

341
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,380
I’d have a happy marriage.

342
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,430
Turns out

343
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:26,500
only I want to get married.

344
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,430
He’s in love with someone else.

345
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,420
Perhaps

346
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,020
he’s never loved me.

347
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,520
You’re lucky.

348
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,020
I’m lucky?

349
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:53,140
Yeah.

350
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:55,140
Look,

351
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,800
first,

352
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,230
your mom loved you dearly.

353
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,640
She knew she couldn’t keep you,

354
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:02,710
so she left you outside rich people’s house

355
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,430
so that you could live well.

356
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,190
Then

357
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,500
that couple adopted you.

358
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:14,040
That shows they’re kindhearted

359
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,310
and they give you a home.

360
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,190
Now,

361
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,980
you didn’t marry the man who doesn’t love you.

362
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:24,830
You have plenty of time to get a new relationship,

363
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:25,710
to marry a better man

364
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:26,710
and enjoy the rest of your life.

365
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,740
You’ve been given enough luck.

366
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:33,470
I love him.

367
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,800
He promised to marry me.

368
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:40,680
But he abandoned me

369
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,100
just like what my parents did.

370
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,700
Was I born to be abandoned?

371
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,580
It’s not fair.

372
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,260
When we were abandoned,

373
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,280
we couldn’t support ourselves

374
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:59,520
and could only rely on others.

375
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,470
Now is different.

376
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,310
We’re adults.

377
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,640
Why do you still feel

378
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,710
abandoned?

379
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:11,780
We aren’t objects.

380
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,520
We don’t belong to anyone

381
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:16,230
but ourselves.

382
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,640
Other than yourself,

383
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:18,940
who could abandon you?

384
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,430
I think

385
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,110
you’re too dependent on him.

386
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,110
That’s not love.

387
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:30,000
Perhaps what you love

388
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,040
is to have someone to rely on.

389
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,430
You can crash with me tonight.

390
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,700
Ziqian.

391
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:05,100
Have you found Yunyi?

392
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,590
You broke Yunyi’s heart

393
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,760
and disappointed me.

394
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,700
I’m sorry that I hurt her.

395
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,280
Is that how you make yourself less guilty?

396
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:27,760
You know

397
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,280
how much she loves you?

398
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,830
I do,

399
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,940
but now, I finally realize

400
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,400
what I have with Yunyi isn’t love

401
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:44,700
but family affection.

402
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,110
Shan Junhao,

403
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,380
you’re too selfish.

404
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:54,150
Have you ever considered Yunyi’s feelings?

405
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,980
Not even a little bit?

406
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:58,340
Who is she to you?

407
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,780
A toy that you can play with or discard anytime?

408
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,310
Is that your so-called family affection?

409
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:06,560
It’s not what you said.

410
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,680
Yunyi disappeared

411
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,020
but no one cared about her.

412
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,070
Nobody even knew

413
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:14,400
when she was gone.

414
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,280
No one

415
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,830
in your family

416
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,280
has ever asked her

417
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,230
what she really wants.

418
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,400
The accident happened too suddenly.

419
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,160
It was a mess.

420
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,780
I didn’t mean to ignore her.

421
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:33,280
If anything happens to her,

422
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,560
I’ll make you pay.

423
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:38,320
What’s wrong with you, Ziqian?

424
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,110
You’re overacting.

425
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,300
Overacting?

426
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,620
You’ll see what overacting is really like.

427
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,060
You and your family

428
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,920
must pay

429
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,280
for all your deeds.

430
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,380
Mrs. Shan,

431
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,350
don’t be too sad.

432
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:50,640
They will find

433
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:52,110
Miss Yunyi.

434
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,830
It’s time to bring food to Mr. Shan.

435
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,310
OK.

436
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,310
I brought you goody.

437
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,100
What is it?

438
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:09,470
Pig brain soup.

439
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:10,880
Good for your brain.

440
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,340
Have you found Director Fan?

441
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:30,920
Don’t worry.

442
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,760
We’ll find her.

443
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,180
It’s my fault.

444
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,520
Don’t beat yourself up.

445
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,710
I failed to handle it well.

446
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:46,000
Alright.

447
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,560
I’ll eat.

448
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,760
It tastes good.

449
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,190
Did you have it?

450
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:04,780
It’s amazing.

451
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,470
Gary,

452
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:18,560
have you got anything?

453
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,820
My men checked every place

454
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,590
Director Fan might go,

455
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:22,640
but didn’t see her.

456
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,830
There’s no record of her

457
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:25,710
at the train station or the airport.

458
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:30,400
Keep searching.

459
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,680
Yes.

460
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,230
Mrs. Shan.

461
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:07,160
Come with me.

462
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:20,300
Do you know what you are doing?

463
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,290
Ever since you showed up,

464
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:25,470
Junhao got injured

465
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:26,760
and Yunyi went missing.

466
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,350
You won’t stop

467
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:31,040
until our family

468
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,310
falls apart, will you?

469
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,760
Mrs. Shan,

470
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:36,190
I...

471
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:37,310
Listen,

472
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:39,830
no one can replace Yunyi.

473
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,680
Although their wedding

474
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,680
didn’t complete,

475
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,160
she’s my only daughter-in-law.

476
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,880
If we can’t get her back,

477
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,710
I’ll hold you accountable.

478
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:04,110
If you truly love Junhao,

479
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,520
then stay as far as you can from him.

480
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,640
What do you want to eat?

481
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,000
I’ll tell Mrs. Lin to cook it for you.

482
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,520
How did it go? Have you found Yunyi?

483
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,070
Not yet.

484
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,800
The police are checking surveillance tapes.

485
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,160
It takes time.

486
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,710
I’ve had men look for her too.

487
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:02,400
I see. Go back to work.

488
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:10,630
Yunyi has nothing with her

489
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:12,670
and she’s still blind.

490
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,220
She’s out there all alone.

491
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:19,150
What if anything happens to her?

492
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,360
Mom,

493
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,000
don’t scare yourself.

494
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,910
I’m sure Yunyi can protect herself.

495
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:32,390
It’s Ye Qianyu’s fault.

496
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,190
Junhao,

497
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:39,630
can you cut ties with her

498
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:40,670
please?

499
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,910
I know

500
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:50,230
you won’t listen to whatever I say.

501
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,630
But think about it.

502
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:57,230
You and Yunyi grew up together.

503
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,390
Even if she isn’t your wife,

504
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:03,320
she’s still like your sister.

505
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,000
If anything bad happens to her,

506
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,870
will you live with a clear conscience?

507
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:10,230
Mom,

508
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:12,950
I know.

509
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:15,580
I promise

510
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,430
I’ll find her.

511
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:23,630
Since Yunyi went missing,

512
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,520
Ziqian has changed.

513
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:29,940
I know

514
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,910
he blames us for what happened.

515
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,120
Junhao,

516
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,560
please try to understand me.

517
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:44,760
I’ve lost your dad

518
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,870
and I can’t afford more losses.

519
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:00,910
Eat up.

520
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:11,230
Qianyu,

521
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:13,840
I need to discuss something with you.

522
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:15,120
What is it?

523
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:19,430
You’ve decided to stay

524
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:21,800
and quit your job

525
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,080
in Senwell.

526
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:26,910
Why don’t you take charge of Guanmei Inn?

527
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:36,040
I’m old

528
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,040
and bad at hotel management.

529
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:40,520
I almost ruined the inn.

530
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,360
Now, the business is starting to pick up.

531
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,230
I don’t want to screw it up again.

532
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:48,150
Qianyu, you’re smart

533
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,800
and you’ve learned a lot from Tonghao.

534
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:53,390
You also worked in Senwell Hotel

535
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,320
for a while.

536
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,800
I’m sure

537
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,600
you can make Guanmei Inn boom.

538
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:01,600
But

539
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,150
without Tonghao,

540
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,560
I don’t think

541
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,710
I can do it alone.

542
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,630
When I got injured,

543
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:12,560
didn’t you fill in for me?

544
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,670
Besides, Fengqiao, Sheng and Master

545
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,670
will all listen to you.

546
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:18,150
You’ll do a good job.

547
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,240
Trust yourself.

548
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:26,280
What about the Money Bag Grocery?

549
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,120
Chen can’t run it alone.

550
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:34,660
You’re my best delivery girl.

551
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:36,150
But if you become

552
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:37,740
the head of the inn,

553
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,710
that’ll also make me proud.

554
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,390
Relax.

555
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,360
I’m free.

556
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,910
I can deliver goods, too, right?

557
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:48,940
Can you do that at your age?

558
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,360
I’m old but experienced.

559
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,040
Well, for the sake of your happiness,

560
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:02,520
I guess I’ll have to take over the inn.

561
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:05,950
Tang,

562
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,430
am I supposed to be your heir?

563
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:09,670
I...

564
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:12,280
You troublemaker! What are you talking about?

565
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:15,430
Ye Qianyu,

566
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:17,520
since you’ll take my property,

567
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,230
from now on,

568
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:21,470
you’ll have to raise my allowance.

569
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:22,280
Fair enough, huh?

570
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,800
Not gonna happen!

571
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,560
Director Xu,

572
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:51,760

Mr. Shan!

Mr. Shan,

584
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,080
did your father

585
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,760
murder his business partner?

587

to become the largest shareholder of Senwell?

588
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,800
It’s said you and Director Xu Ziqian

590
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,470

Will you apologize to him?

Did your father really...

593
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:11,910
Sorry, everyone.

594
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:12,800

Mr. Shan,

Mom,

639
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:48,120
is the news true?

640
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:50,280
Junhao,

641
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,520
trust me.

642
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,560
Your father wasn’t that kind of person.

643
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:57,840
Then why did they say that?

644
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:03,470
I was at home looking after you kids,

645
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:04,470
so I didn’t know much

646
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:05,980
about the company.

647
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,630
Your dad once told me

648
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,120
one of Yifeng’s friends

649
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,360
owned a company named Dongdao Finance.

650
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:16,630
It was about to go broke,

651
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,710
so he asked Yifeng for help.

652
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,260
Yifeng couldn’t turn him down,

653
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:22,760
so he decided to fund his company.

654
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,580
But your dad and Minghan’s disagreed.

655
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,220
Yifeng didn’t listen

656
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,600
and invested the money anyway.

657
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,950
Later on,

658
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:33,740
his friend ran off with the funds,

659
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:36,910
which almost destroyed Senwell.

660
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,390
Yifeng blamed himself

661
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:40,980
for it

662
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:43,300
and deemed that he wasn’t cut out to do business,

663
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:46,020
so he decided to quit.

664
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,980
The recording says otherwise.

665
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:51,950
Dad forced Uncle Xu to quit.

666
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:54,320
Your dad would never do that.

667
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,560
There must be a misunderstanding.

668
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,060
Did dad give that yacht

669
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,700
to Uncle Xu?

670
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:06,760
Yes.

671
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:10,950
I’ll find out the truth.
