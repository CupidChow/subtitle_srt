Truth about Shan Junhao’s Violence =

12
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,590
You’re still reading that?

13
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,310
Look at these comments.

14
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,310
Xie Quan deserves them for what he did.

15
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,680
Everyone condemns him.

16
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,830
He asks for it.

17
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,400
However, this incident

18
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,590
isn’t as simple as it seems.

19
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,550
There must be a great power behind him.

20
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,360
You mean…

21
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,590
I mean

22
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,080
Xie Quan looks like a scumbag,

23
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,400
but he’s clear about the gains and losses.

24
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,360
He wouldn’t have enraged Shan Junhao
for no reason.

25
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,880
Senwell Group

26
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,520
is too powerful to challenge for him.

27
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,910
So he must have a strong backup.

28
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,520
Who will the man behind him be?

29
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,190
It’s hard to say.

30
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,960
It could be business competition

31
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,910
or personal grudges.

32
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,000
Have some.

33
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,600
The reverse of Xie Quan’s incident

34
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,360
brought ample positive publicity

35
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,670
to the hotel and the group.

36
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,520
Stock price is rising.

37
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,750
Our clients are assured.

38
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,910
And the investors resume cooperation with us.

39
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,600
Its publicity effect

40
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,470
surpasses publicity methods of any kind.

41
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,880
Especially for Mr. Shan,

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,600
he turned from a mysterious executive officer

43
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,600
into justice itself.

44
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,750
He’s as famous as a movie star.

45
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,800
Mr. Shan’s strike back

46
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,390
cleared the misunderstanding

47
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,630
and built a positive image

48
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,670
for Senwell.

49
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,320
But I don’t think

50
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,640
it’s as simple

51
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,000
as it seems.

52
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,960
Perhaps Xie Quan challenged

53
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,830
Senwell for other reasons.

54
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,190
I also think

55
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,910
we have to find out the truth.

56
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,030
I guess

57
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,520
it’s Marv that’s behind Xie Quan’s back.

58
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,470
The espionage didn’t break them down

59
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,030
due to a lack of evidence.

60
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,160
This is probably their retaliation.

61
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,080
Lately,

62
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,520
they competed with us on clients

63
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,030
in malicious ways.

64
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,800
In the bidding projects recently,

65
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,440
Marv always beat us

66
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,270
with offers slightly

67
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,880
lower than ours.

68
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,000
So I doubt

69
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,670
we have Marv’s spy among us.

70
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,030
Though Mr. Shan

71
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,800
safeguarded Senwell’s image in person,

72
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,520
it can’t reverse the fact

73
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,520
of a declining performance.

74
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,960
The hotel industry in particular.

75
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,550
The seasonal financial reports
are soon to be announced,

76
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,030
but Senwell

77
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,520
has no realistic good news

78
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:15,030
which the investors really want to see.

79
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,510
All right.

80
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,480
All departments, file an analytic report

81
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,510
and coping measures.

82
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,230
I hope what you propose

83
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,880
are solutions,

84
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:27,110
instead of issues.

85
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,950
Pay close attention

86
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,320
to Marv’s movements.

87
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,760
And conduct a thorough internal investigation,

88
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:34,880
especially of employees

89
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,760
who have access to corporate secrets.

90
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,350
You haven’t reset the code?

91
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,070
Thanks for the tip.

92
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:12,110
Ye Qianyu came out of nowhere

93
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,600
and saved Shan Junhao out of trouble.

94
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,550
But due to this incident,

95
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,550
Xie Quan must hate Shan Junhao

96
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,000
and Ye Qianyu.

97
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,510
Shan Junhao?

98
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,230
Ye Qianyu?

99
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,110
I don’t suggest you do that.

100
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,000
Xie Quan’s provocation

101
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,110
has caused baneful impact on the company.

102
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,350
With Marv as our competitor,

103
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,070
even if we kick Shan Junhao out,

104
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,320
I’m not sure we could clear up the mess

105
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,200
Shan Junhao leaves

106
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,670
once the company is influenced.

107
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,200
I hope your personal feelings won’t

108
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,510
influence your judgement.

109
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,230
Be very cautious about it.

110
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:03,660
= Let the frog be your company.
It used to be Tonghao’s best friend, too. =

111
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,570
Come in.

112
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:34,790
Director Fan,

113
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,370
this is the profile of the hotel employee

114
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:37,660
who filmed the video about Xie Quan.

115
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,600
For employees

116
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,950
who make great contributions to the company,

117
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,550
we must reward them.

118
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,160
Contact the hotel manager

119
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:45,540
and give her…

120
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,900
= Resume =

121
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,640
Is there a problem, Director Fan?

122
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,110
Go back to your work.

123
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:52,760
OK.

124
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,320
= Ye Qianyu Resume =

125
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,720
It’s her?

126
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,440
How come?

127
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,320
Come in.

128
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,110
Junhao,

129
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,640
when are you available?

130
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,950
The moderator wants us to get familiar

131
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:16,920
with the schedule of the wedding.

132
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,110
I might be busy these days.

133
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,270
How about later?

134
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,510
It’s a period of time to the wedding, isn’t it?

135
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,230
Junhao,

136
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,710
you seem to value

137
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,640
the stuffed frog from the employee.

138
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,840
What’s her name?

139
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,200
Which department is she in?

140
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,590
I’ll contact the hotel manager to reward her.

141
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,520
It’s Ye Qianyu.

142
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,350
Ye Qianyu?

143
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:59,790
No need to reward her.

144
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,150
She said she wanted to hone her skills
in her current position.

145
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,400
Have you met her?

146
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:17,400
Yes.

147
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,880
To say thank you.

148
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:26,080
Junhao, thank you for letting me know.

149
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,200
A heavy mind?

150
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,960
Are you occupied, too?

151
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,400
Can the breeze

152
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:42,000
blow away the sorrow

153
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,150
and enlighten you?

154
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,200
If it can’t,

155
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:50,150
why do people in bad mood

156
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,760
all come here?

157
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,150
The view across can’t enlighten you.

158
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,400
It only makes you feel humbler,

159
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,910
too humble to be noticed.

160
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,960
In this way,

161
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,000
nothing would matter to you.

162
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:14,400
Perhaps, it’s enlightenment to some extent.

163
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,230
Ziqian,

164
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:22,030
since when you’ve become so pessimistic?

165
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,710
Have I?

166
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,000
It’s not like you.

167
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,320
In my eyes,

168
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,110
you’re always like the sunflower

169
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,640
which grows in the direction of the sun.

170
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:47,550
But the sun isn’t always hanging in the sky.

171
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,960
Did anything go wrong?

172
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:01,670
No.

173
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,230
Tell me what’s troubling you.

174
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,710
It’s about Junhao, isn’t it?

175
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,080
Do you have the feeling

176
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,550
that Junhao changed a lot?

177
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,440
People don’t change for no reason.

178
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,300
Sometimes, it’s because part of them in hidden

179
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,360
is activated.

180
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:33,590
But I don’t understand

181
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,400
what Ye Qianyu did that activated him.

182
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,400
They’re from two different worlds.

183
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,760
Sometimes, Junhao is hateful.

184
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,960
He takes everyone’s love for granted,

185
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:49,030
but never treats others with his true heart.

186
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,320
I don’t want to be petty

187
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,670
and judge Junhao.

188
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,350
But I can’t help doubting him

189
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,960
due to what he did.

190
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,590
I hate this feeling.

191
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:10,440
Yunyi,

192
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:13,280
you should love yourself more.

193
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,710
Even you believe

194
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,710
Junhao doesn’t care about me?

195
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,910
If my answer is yes,

196
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,230
will you choose to move on?

197
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,460
Whatever your choice is,

198
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,420
you have my support.

199
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,150
Not bad!

200
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,710
In just a few days, you made progress.

201
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:01,110
Your mistake is others’ opportunity.

202
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,350
That’s what you told me.

203
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,910
I thought you didn’t

204
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,350
care about opportunities.

205
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,790
People change sooner or later.

206
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,350
Let’s kick off.

207
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,760
You’re distracted.

208
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,080
You’ll lose if you go on like this.

209
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,110
Don’t worry.

210
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,440
I won’t lose.

211
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,030
Especially not today.

212
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:32,840
Right.

213
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,520
You’ve won too many.

214
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,790
Winning to you

215
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,350
is for granted.

216
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,710
But have you ever thought

217
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,320
maybe one day,

218
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,670
you would lose?

219
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,520
Ziqian,

220
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,840
I know what I’m doing.

221
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,790
Do you, really?

222
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,220
Of course, I do.

223
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,000
If I don’t,

224
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,440
I have you to remind me, don’t I?

225
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:10,760
Junhao,

226
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,000
Yunyi has never walked out of the shadow

227
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,760
of being abandoned by her family.

228
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,760
She’s placed all stakes on you.

229
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,080
I hope you understand it.

230
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,200
I do.

231
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,200
If I didn’t,

232
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,200
why would I marry Yunyi?

233
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:39,840
Dinner time.

234
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,590
End of game.

235
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,790
I told you I wouldn’t lose today.

236
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,860
However, you’re getting closer

237
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,960
to defeat me.

238
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,280
Great job!

239
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,030
Come on.

240
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:56,910
Let’s go.

241
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:10,520
Mom,

242
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,590
it’ll be your birthday next week.

243
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:13,960
What presents do you want?

244
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:17,000
Actually, I want to take this opportunity

245
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,590
to throw a cocktail party.

246
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:22,790
Junhao, your dad has left us,

247
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,200
but I think you should meet

248
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,400
his friends.

249
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:28,110
After all, it’s friendship for years,

250
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:29,440
we can’t just cut it off.

251
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:30,550
Mom,

252
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,520
don’t you hate noise?

253
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,280
Yes.

254
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,200
I do like tranquility.

255
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,590
But it’s a different situation now.

256
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,670
The group is in peril.

257
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,320
Mom also wants to do something

258
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,590
instrumental to Senwell’s development.

259
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,910
Moreover, you’re young and ambitious.

260
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:51,280
You should learn from and exchange ideas with

261
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,440
the seniors and peers,

262
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,960
so that you can assume the office

263
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,520
of Chairman of Board smoothly.

264
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,670
This is also your dad’s will.

265
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,790
But birthday party is a private event.

266
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,350
You make it a social engagement party.

267
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,070
Is it a little bit…

268
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:08,680
Junhao,

269
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,470
I know you always focus on work

270
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,920
and dislike social engagement.

271
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,710
But it won’t do any harm

272
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,710
to Senwell’s development by maintaining friendship

273
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:17,760
with figures in business community

274
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,560
in this opportunity.

275
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,430
Ziqian, what do you think?

276
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:26,640
I think it’s good.

277
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,710
OK, it’s settled then.

278
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,680
OK.

279
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,950
Since you all agree,

280
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,640
let’s throw a party.

281
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:40,220
I thought you would be as stubborn as usual.

282
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,830
I’ll make a list of guests then.

283
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:47,880
We can allocate chefs, service staff

284
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,760
from the hotel.

285
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,430
OK.

286
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,800
I’ll leave it to the three of you.

287
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,430
= Money Bag Grocery =

288
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:00,110
Have more!

289
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,070
Qianyu,

290
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,640
the duty in the hotel must be heavy.

291
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,470
When you feel tired,

292
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:07,680
come back home.

293
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:08,950
I’ll raise you.

294
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:11,830
When Qianyu was at home in the past,

295
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:12,760
Chen,

296
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,520
you longed for her to get out of your sight.

297
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,040
Now she’s away,

298
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,400
you want her to come back.

299
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,110
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.

300
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,520
Trust me, Mama Jinzhi,

301
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,160
I’ll take good care of Qianyu.

302
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:35,280
Chen,

303
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,920
it’s paycheck day in a few days.

304
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:41,520
And I may be given a reward this month.

305
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,800
Do you know?

306
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,950
I’m a big name now.

307
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:46,800
I’m the heroine who saved

308
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,400
Senwell Hotel, even the Senwell Group.

309
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,800
You think you’re the Holy Mother?

310
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,760
Gloating on a stupid deal.

311
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,040
You’re such a fool.

312
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,920
A fool!

313
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,950
Here. Have some more

314
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,190
so you can grow smarter.

315
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:14,520
All right.

316
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,920
Thank you.

317
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,920
You’re welcome.

318
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,470
If that’s all, I should go.

319
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,760
Hold on.

320
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:28,520
Taichu,

321
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,950
I gave Qianyu to you

322
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:32,950
because I trusted you.

323
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,590
Is that how you look after her?

324
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,230
What’s up, Mama Jinzhi?

325
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:42,110
Qianyu isn’t the hotel manager.

326
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,430
It seems she isn’t your assistant, either.

327
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,760
Stop lying to me.

328
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,000
What’s going on?

329
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:49,000
Has Qianyu told you everything?

330
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,640
Well, that silly girl

331
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,680
never shared her sorrow with us.

332
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,830
But I feel sorry for her.

335
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,710
She bowed down,

336
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:07,760
scooped this slippery frog

337
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:10,590
and kissed it.

338
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,950
In an instant,

339
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:15,710
the spell on the frog was lifted.

340
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,800
Please,

341
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,470
my dear Ye Qianyu,

342
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,230
I don’t want to hear The Frog Prince anymore.

343
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,280
But it’s my favorite story ever.

344
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,560
Mama Jinzhi,

345
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,590
Qianyu was my assistant in the beginning.

346
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,560
But something happened later,

347
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,340
then she had to start with

348
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,240
fundamental work.

349
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:36,710
I tried to stop her,

350
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,110
but she was determined.

351
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:40,230
She said doing the easiest work well

352
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,310
isn’t easy at all.

353
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:43,980
Wait.

354
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,350
You can’t watch her

355
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:47,110
doing the cleaning job.

356
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,710
Well, I’d rather she run delivery errands

357
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:50,560
than cleaning rooms.

358
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,880
I would never allow my kids to bow down

359
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,470
and serve anyone.

360
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,000
Qianyu did this

361
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,520
to prove herself in her own way.

362
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,280
I can only show my respect.

363
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:01,310
And she did prove herself.

364
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:02,310
Within a month,

365
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:04,350
she saved Senwell twice from crisis.

366
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:06,160
It’s not something common girls are capable of.

367
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,000
So,

368
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,160
what she said is real?

369
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,280
Taichu,

370
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,590
I don’t know anything

371
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,160
in the workplace.

372
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,950
So I ask you

373
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:31,230
to look after my daughter, Qianyu.

374
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:33,110
Rest assured, Mama Jinzhi.

375
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,920
I will take good care of her.

376
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:38,710
OK.

377
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:42,430
Go back home and have some rest.

378
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:43,830
Good night.

Mr. Taichu.

00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:05,190
It’ll be Chairman Jiang’s birthday this weekend.

385
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,760
We want to invite you to the party.

386

Here is the invitation.

= Invitation =

388
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:12,070
If you’re available,

389
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,110
do come to the party.

390
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,710
Since you send the invitation in person,

391
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,800
I will go.

392
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:19,680
By the way,

393
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,560
you can bring a date.

394
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:22,880
OK, thank you.

395
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,830
See you then.

396
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,310
Date?

Qianyu.

398
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,230
I’m exhausted today.

399
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:52,310
Finally, it’s the weekend.

400
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,560
When I get home,

401
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,310
I’m going to eat three bowls of rice

402
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:57,230
and wake up naturally tomorrow morning.

00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,040
can you please be my date?

405
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,280
Date?

406
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:02,560
What date?

407
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,280
It’s Chairman Jiang’s birthday party.

408
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,350
Come with me.

409
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,400
The Chairman’s birthday party?

410
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,640
I’ve never been to such events.

411
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,280
I would embarrass you.

412
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,640
Find someone else.

413
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,680
Don’t worry. I’ve prepared everything.

414
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,710
Just take it as a favor.

415
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,520
Thank you.

= Money Bag Grocery =

418
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:45,880
Where is it?

00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,400
What are you looking for?

420
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,680
Mom, have you seen…

421
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,830
The uniform of your company is so weird.

422
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:02,470
The manager dresses like the cleaning staff.

423
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:11,280
Mom.

424
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,520
I lied to you from the beginning.

425
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,640
I am a cleaning girl.

426
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:26,400
I thought you wouldn’t tell me

427
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,590
until you became the manager.

428
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,640
You already knew it?

429
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,190
I knew it the day I delivered

430
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:33,680
surprise lunch to you.

431
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,880
I didn’t mean to lie to you.

432
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:43,160
I was afraid you would stop me.

433
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:46,070
I can’t tie you up, can I?

434
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:49,880
You don’t blame me, do you?

435
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,310
I don’t blame you.

436
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:55,560
Taichu has told me.

437
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:59,350
If that’s your choice,

438
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,110
you have my support.

439
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:05,280
Mom,

440
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,800
you’re the best mom.

441
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,520
Slow down. Slow down.

442
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,000
The dress is small on you.

443
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:19,950
Throw out your chest.

444
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,190
Watch out! Careful.

445
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:32,310
Talented man and gorgeous lady.

446
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:34,400
- A perfect match! - Perfect couple.

447
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,400
Shall we?

448
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,710
Hold on.

449
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,040
That’s what I saw on TV.

450
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,640
Can we go now?

451
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:07,710
- Of course. - Off you go.

452
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:11,580
- Bye-bye, drive safe. - Please.

453
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,650
- You look so beautiful today. - I know.

454
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,900
Slow down!

455
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,180
- Cheers! - It’s been a long time!

456
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,950
How are you doing?

457
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,560
- Hey. - Yes, it’s been a long time.

458
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,760
- How is everything? - Everything’s fine.

459
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,140
Welcome.

460
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,350
A toast.

461
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,000
- Thank you! - Thank you.

462
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,860
Thank you.

463
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:41,920
Thank you for coming!

464
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,520
Thank you! Thank you for coming!

465
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:46,760
Happy birthday, Mrs. Shan.

466
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,760
Thank you. Thank you, my friends.

467
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,110
Thank you!

468
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,870
- Happy birthday! - You’re welcome.

469
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,040
If you need any help in the future,
feel free to ask.

470
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:08,680
I have to say you’re better at acting now.

471
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,190
You look like a real member of the Shan family.

472
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,880
I never expected

473
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:18,880
that Shan Junhao used Mrs. Shan’s birthday

474
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,310
to grow his social connections.

475
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:22,710
But it’s great.

476
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:24,430
It’s also an opportunity for us.

477
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,310
All present at the party today

478
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,070
are business resources.

479
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:32,960
You should get to know them.

480
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:34,680
It’s good for your future.

481
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,280
You do care so much about me.

482
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,170
It’s been quite a while since the last time

483
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,800
we met Mrs. Shan before we went abroad.

484
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,670
Yes, it has.

485
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,640
Thank you.

486
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,350
Let’s go.

487
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,970
So good to see you again.

488
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:25,190
This is the second time I come here.

489
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,590
When was the first time?

490
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:31,070
Come on.

491
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,560
Hello, manager.

492
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,070
Qianyu,

493
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:45,310
it’s Chairman Jiang’s birthday party today.

494
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,520
Mr. Shan isn’t satisfied with
one of the waitresses

495
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,230
from our hotel.

496
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:49,230
You go fill in her position.

497
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:51,000
Remember. Wear our uniform.

498
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,760
But I have an appointment today.

499
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,400
You must fill in.

500
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,280
Or don’t bother

501
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,560
coming to work next week.

502
00:28:58,590 --> 00:28:59,470
What’s up?

503
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,560
There’s a problem with one of the waitresses.

504
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,920
The manager wants me to fill in.

505
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:04,880
Forgive me, Taichu.

506
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,710
I can’t be your date.

507
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,680
Never mind, Qianyu.

508
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:10,350
Thank you.

509
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,400
Qianyu.

510
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,310
Mom,

511
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,230
I’m assigned to an urgent job.

512
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:19,920
Can you send my uniform over?

513
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,400
I’ll text you the address.

514
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,160
OK, OK.

515
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,860
- I’ll leave you to talk. - OK, go on.

516
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:26,660
You two catch up.

517
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:29,710
Mr. Zhang, long time no see.

518
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:31,230
Taichu, long time no see.

519
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,400
A drink.

520
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:38,000
- Tastes good. Cheers! - Cheers!

521
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,160
Qianyu.

522
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,920
Mom, finally.

523
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:53,280
Here you are.

524
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:54,600
Oh my!

525
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,520
Wow!

526
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,430
Whose house is this?

527
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:59,280
It’s so big and stylish.

528
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,470
This is Shan Junhao’s home.

529
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:02,110
It’s his mom’s birthday today.

530
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,110
What are you doing here?

531
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,040
I…

532
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,880
I’m in charge of beverages and hospitality.

533
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,280
Why should my daughter take care of beverages?

534
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:17,070
Not to mention in Shan Junhao’s home.

535
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,830
Come on. Go home with me.

536
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:19,590
Mom,

537
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,360
- this is my job. - So what?

538
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,680
There’s wisdom in serving beverages.

539
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,800
Every detail

540
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,000
serves the idea of our services.

541
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,230
I don’t have a diploma.

542
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:30,310
So I can only accumulate experience in practice.

543
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,400
I have no objection to you

544
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,070
accumulating experience.

545
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:37,000
But not with Shan Junhao!

546
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,110
We’re just colleagues now.

547
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,350
I can’t talk with you anymore.

548
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:42,680
I need to get ready.

549
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,400
Qianyu,

550
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,470
listen to me.

551
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,880
I did say you have my support.

552
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:52,400
But don’t you think it’s awkward?

553
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,310
Mom,

554
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,470
I know what I’m doing.

555
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,710
All right. Go home.

556
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,070
Wait.

557
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:02,470
Where is the toilet?

558
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:04,110
I rushed here

559
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,040
and didn’t have time to go to toilet.

560
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,830
Toilet for guests is upstairs.

561
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:07,640
I can’t talk to you any longer.

562
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,520
I really am late. See you.

563
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,350
OK, OK.

564
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:11,920
You go. To your work.

565
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,640
Goodness!

566
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,000
- I heard Mr. Wang was coming. - Hi.

567
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,640
Really?

568
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,950
- Yeah. - I haven’t seen him for a long time.

569
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:21,580
Let’s have a drink.

570
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,580
Thank you.

571
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,710
Ye Qianyu.

572
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,350
Director Fan.

573
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:41,190
Aren’t you Taichu’s date?

574
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,070
I was assigned at last minute

575
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,590
to fill in another’s position.

576
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,560
That’s absurd!

577
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,280
Look,

578
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:49,040
I’ll ask the hotel to send someone else.

579
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,560
Go upstairs and change.

580
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,430
You’re here as a guest…

581
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:52,520
That’s OK.

582
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,110
Don’t bother, Director Fan.

583
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:56,190
There’s no time for the hotel to send another.

584
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:57,430
It’s good to be a waitress.

585
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:59,760
I’m also enjoying the cocktail party, aren’t I?

586
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:00,940
But…

587
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:01,950
It doesn’t matter.

588
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:03,280
I’ll go back to work.

589
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,040
Come, let’s have a drink with Mr. Wang.

590
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:28,730
OK.

591
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:33,590
Hungry?

592
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:39,040
People will misunderstand.

593
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,040
About what?

594
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:44,800
You have to eat to maintain your strength to work.

595
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,710
Thank you.

596
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:00,710
Tastes good.

597
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,480
One more piece.

598
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:09,920
Nice!

599
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,160
Ye Qianyu,

600
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,920
the guests ask for a glass of Martell, no ice,

601
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,950
two glasses of Hennessy,

602
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:18,430
four glasses of Remy Martin, on rocks,

603
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:19,830
and a glass of Lafite.

604
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:21,430
OK, right away.

605
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,190
OK.

606
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,560
I should go back to work.

607
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:27,000
A glass of Martell…

608
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:33,640
It’s been years.

609
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,590
Martell…

610
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:43,710
The guests ask for a glass of Martell, no ice,

611
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,950
two glasses of Hennessy…

612
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:47,760
A glass of Martell, no ice,

613
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,520
a glass of Lafite,

614
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,880
two glasses of Hennessy,

615
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,950
and four glasses of Remy Martin, thank you.

616
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:52,950
OK.

617
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,760
Thank you for saving me.

618
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:59,400
I don’t know what they’re talking about.

619
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:00,830
Don’t worry.

620
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,520
I’m your special assistant today.

621
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:03,680
Thank you.

622
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,000
Rich people are different from us.

623
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,760
It’s golden.

624
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,470
May I help you?

625
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,120
A glass of Margarita.

626
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:40,630
I want a glass of Mojito,

627
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:41,520
a little ice, thanks.

628
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:44,000
Give me a glass of Hennessy.

629
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,190
No ice, thanks.

630
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:46,280
Taichu.

631
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:50,510
Yes.

632
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,120
It seems you’re getting along well with Mr. Shan.

633
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,360
I believe the cooperation between GQ and Senwell

634
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:58,600
will be wonderful because of you.

635
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:00,710
I’m flattered, Mr. Wang.

636
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:02,280
Hello.

637
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,520
May I help you, sir?

638
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:13,390
Three glasses of Champagne.

639
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:14,520
OK.

640
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:20,120
Mr. Shan, is everything smooth with the project?

641
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,040
Absolutely, very smooth.

642
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:24,840
Glad to hear. What do you think, Taichu?

643
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,280
Taichu, I’m sure Mr. Shan will solve

644
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,360
the problem you raised just now.

645
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:44,610
Your Champagne.

646
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:50,280
Well,

647
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,950
a toast to fruitful cooperation.

648
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:55,190
To our cooperation.

649
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,080
Is everything alright, Mr. Shan?

650
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:12,760
Yes.

651
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,080
Taichu, please go on.

652
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,230
I’m very interested in the proposal you mentioned.

653
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:18,230
Here is the thing.

654
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,040
Here comes the cake!

655
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,820
Pretty good.

656
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:37,940
Yes, it is.

657
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:41,000
I’m grateful to all of you

658
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,950
for coming to my birthday party.

659
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:47,470
You’re my families, friends

660
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:49,840
and long-term partners of Senwell.

661
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:52,710
Since Yaolong passed away,

662
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,150
the future of Senwell

663
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,870
has been handed over to the younger generation.

664
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:58,670
I hope you can support Senwell

665
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:00,150
like you always do.

666
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,430
And I wish you enjoy the drinks

667
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:04,560
and the party.

668
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:05,560
Cheers!

669
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,190
- Cheers! - Cheers!

670
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:14,840
Mom, happy birthday.

671
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,670
Mom, happy birthday.

672
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,360
Aunt Jiang,

673
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,630
I wish you stay young and beautiful forever.

674
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,320
Thank you, my babies.

675
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,950
Aunt Jiang, happy birthday.

676
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:25,890
- Happy birthday! - Happy birthday!

677
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:27,030
- Thanks. - Happy birthday!

678
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:29,150
- Happy birthday!
- Thank you. Thank you, everyone.

679
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,760
Mom, let’s cut the cake.

680
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,230
Thank you all again.

681
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:48,390
Here. One more toast.

682
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:49,360
- Together. - Cheers!

683
00:37:59,190 --> 00:37:59,870
Mom,

684
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,230
are you alright?

685
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,520
Yes.

686
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,040
I drank a little too much.

687
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,190
My head aches.

688
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,840
A pill will fix me.

689
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,360
Let me go upstairs with you.

690
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,670
Be careful.

691
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:30,870
What?

692
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:56,520
I’ll get some water.

693
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,910
Have some rest after you take the pill.

694
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,000
I’m fine.

695
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,870
Better go downstairs later.

696
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,280
There are guests.

697
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,360
The hostess can’t leave for long.

698
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,430
Mom.

699
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:55,800
Mr. Wang,

700
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,080
on behalf of Senwell,

701
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,430
I’d like to thank GQ Ventures
for the great support.

702
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:00,150
Thank you.

703
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,320
GQ and Senwell

704
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,040
will open a new chapter in the future.

705
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:04,950
Qianyu,

706
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:09,120
did you add something else

707
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,190
in Shan Junhao’s glass?

708
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,910
Just some ginger sauce,

709
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:15,950
some vinegar,

710
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,870
and some salt.

711
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,470
He called you away.

712
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:21,950
He must have done it on purpose.

713
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,470
You misunderstand. I didn’t steal anything!

714
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:28,710
I’m here to deliver something!

715
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:30,800
Sir, let’s talk about it!

716
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:31,910
Let go of me!

717
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:33,280
I told you to let go of me!

718
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,000
Stop! Don’t run!

719
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,430
- Get her! - Get her!

720
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:37,910
Let’s go. Mom.

721
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,050
- Cheers! - Cheers!

722
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:42,820
OK.

723
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:43,870
Qianyu!

724
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,230
Qianyu!

725
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:45,800
Qianyu!

726
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:46,700
Mom!

727
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:47,490
What’s going on?

728
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:49,050
Mom.

729
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:50,200
- What’s up? - Qianyu.

730
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:53,030
- What are you doing?
- Tell them I’m not a thief.

731
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,650
Can you release her first, please?

732
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:56,600
- What’s up?
- How did such kind of person get in the party?

733
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,560
What was the security doing?

734
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:01,120
Mom.

735
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,910
She’s Ye Qianyu’s mom.

736
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:06,190
Ye Qianyu?

737
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,080
Ye Qianyu from Guanmei Fishing Village?

738
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,870
Qianyu.

739
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:13,040
Qianyu, tell them now

740
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,280
I’m really not a thief!

741
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,910
Can you let go of my mom first, please?

742
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:17,470
Mama Jinzhi,

743
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:18,670
what’s going on?

744
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:20,000
Cabriolet guy,

745
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,710
they accuse me of stealing.

746
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:23,390
But I didn’t.

747
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,280
Mom,

748
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:29,390
what happened?

749
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:33,080
I went upstairs to take some pills

750
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,470
and found her hiding in my room behind the drapes,

751
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,520
wearing my bracelet.

752
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,160
- So it’s true. - She is a thief.

753
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,940
-She is a thief. - It’s ture.

754
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:51,910
Please explain it.

755
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:57,360
I came to send Qianyu her uniform.

756
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:58,840
After I gave it to her,

757
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,470
I wanted to go to the toilet.

758
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,000
Qianyu told me where it is.

759
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,230
I walked around.

760
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:05,320
The house is too big. I got lost.

761
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,430
Then I saw an

762
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:08,950
extremely grand room.

763
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:10,320
On the dresser,

764
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,150
there is a beautiful bracelet.

765
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:13,040
So I…

766
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,790
I wanted to try it on.

767
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,840
I was going to put it back,

768
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,360
but I couldn’t take it off.

769
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,870
I really didn’t steal anything!

770
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:26,360
All lies!

771
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,520
You should’ve left after you used the toilet.

772
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,180
Why were you so curious about other’s things?

773
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:33,110
And you put it on your wrist.

774
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,930
Isn’t that theft?

775
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:37,280
Send her to the police station.

776
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,600
Don’t. Please, don’t.

777
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,390
I was just curious.

778
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:43,520
I just wanted to try it on.

779
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:44,760
I wanted to take it off,

780
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:46,840
but it didn’t come off my hand!

781
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,040
Mrs. Shan,

782
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:49,840
I swear on my integrity

783
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,390
that my mom would never steal anything.

784
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:53,150
She’s just curious.

785
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,430
I beg you.

786
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:55,950
Please let her go, OK?

787
00:42:58,390 --> 00:42:59,800
Who do you think you are?

788
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:02,390
Why should I believe you?

789
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,320
She’s Senwell’s employee.

790
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:12,870
An employee from the hotel?

791
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,280
Are Senwell’s criteria for new employees

792
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:16,560
so low now?

793
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,230
Mom,

794
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:22,150
she’s just an intern.

795
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:25,080
Let the security release her mom, please.

796
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,000
It’s your birthday today.

797
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,150
We have so many guests here.

798
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:30,880
Mrs. Shan,

799
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:33,800
Ye Qianyu is supposed to be my date.

800
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,080
But she was assigned to work as a waitress.

801
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:37,800
I feel so sorry

802
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,280
about what happened.

803
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:41,300
But as far as I know about Mama Jinzhi,

804
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:43,480
she would never be a thief.

805
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:45,710
Can we release her first

806
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:47,080
and let her take the bracelet off?

807
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,840
Who are you?

808
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:53,710
Mom, Taichu is GQ Ventures’ special consultant.

809
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:56,710
Mr. Wang of GQ Ventures is here, too.

810
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:59,360
Let’s release Qianyu’s mom, OK?

811
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:02,660
But we don’t know

812
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:04,140
- if she’s telling the truth. - Right.

813
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,190
Let her go.

814
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:11,840
It’s OK. You’re fine.

815
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,950
I really can’t take it off!

816
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:15,070
Look at my…

817
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:16,070
Mom, let me help you.

818
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:17,190
Let me give you a hand.

819
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:23,390
Mom,

820
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:25,390
look at her wrist.

821
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:27,120
It’s red and swollen.

822
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:29,190
It proves that she

823
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:31,150
tried couples of times to take the bracelet off,

824
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,910
but failed.

825
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,320
She probably just wanted to try it on.

826
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,000
Even it’s true,

827
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,390
it’s considered burglary

828
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:42,230
to break into another’s home

829
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:43,520
and take their things.

830
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:44,870
Mrs. Shan,

831
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,560
I’m so sorry

832
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,840
that we have spoiled your day.

833
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:50,520
I apologize to you for my mom.

834
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,040
I’m sorry.

835
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,910
You two can go home.

836
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:04,150
When the swelling subsides,

837
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:05,520
return the bracelet immediately.

838
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,080
Thank you, Mr. Shan.

839
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,470
Qianyu, let your mom

840
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:11,470
apply some hand cream before taking it off.

841
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:12,950
Maybe it helps.

842
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:15,950
Thanks, Director Fan.

843
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,000
Let’s go.

844
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:22,120
Mr. Shan, Mrs. Shan,

845
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:23,470
I’m leaving, too.

846
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:25,360
Thank you for your hospitality.

847
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:32,360
All right.

848
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:34,560
Excuse me. I’m sorry for the drama.

849
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,080
Let’s resume the party.

850
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:42,120
Mom,

851
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:44,760
don’t be angry.

852
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:46,910
It’s birthday today.

853
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:47,950
Cheer up.

854
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:49,910
Yes, Mom.

855
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:51,840
We have guests here.

856
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,600
Let’s put it to an end.

857
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,560
