Ding Yuanxun is here.

12
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,120
Mr. Shan,

13
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,160
let’s go.

14
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,240
Junhao, hurry!

15
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,440
Or it’ll be too late.

16
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:32,880
How dare you stop me!

17
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,720
Go away!

18
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,270
Shan Junhao broke in.

19
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:48,520
Someone burst in?

20
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,390
Who?

21
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,830
Mr. Shan.

22
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,320
Who are you?

23
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,630
What is Shan Junhao doing here?

24
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,910
Shan Junhao!

25
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,030
They’re here already, then let them in.

26
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,110
Mr. Shan.

27
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,360
You broke into my club

28
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,600
with so many people.

29
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:18,440
How can I help you?

30
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:25,800
Ding Yuanxun.

31
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,630
Tell Mr. Xu

32
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:29,960
what you did.

33
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,600
I...

34
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:33,630
Mr. Xu,

35
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,440
I lied to you. I’m sorry.

36
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:38,910
Actually,

37
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,630
I didn’t touch the yacht.

38
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,270
I only said so

39
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,960
because Mr. Qiu and Mr. Lin

40
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,830
ordered me to.

41
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,550
Liar!

42
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,270
What?

43
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,240
Back then,

44
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:54,830
I was addicted to gambling.

45
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,080
After Chairman Shan fired me,

46
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:59,800
I lost all my money.

47
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:03,110
My family cut ties with me, too.

48
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,380
Yet I continued

49
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,720
to gamble over the years

50
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,550
and owed huge debts.

51
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,830
When I was desperate,

52
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,880
Mr. Qiu and Mr. Lin came to me

53
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,510
and offered to pay my debts

54
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,670
only if

55
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,670
I followed their orders.

56
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,270
That’s why

57
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,620
I lied to Mr. Xu and Mr. Shan.

58
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,760
I’m sorry.

59
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,270
Stop telling lies!

60
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,200
Mr. Xu,

61
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,320
he’s a liar.

62
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,320
How could you believe

63
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,320
a gambler’s words?

64
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,270
Shan Junhao must’ve coached him

65
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,200
to say that.

66
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:49,440
Mr. Xu,

67
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,220
you have to believe us.

68
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,350
Trust us.

69
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,640
I didn’t lie.

70
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,880
Hearing that

71
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,270
Mr. Shan came to see me,

72
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,480
Mr. Qiu and Mr. Lin feared
that I’d ruin their plan

73
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,070
so they hired someone to silence me.

74
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,790
I managed to escape

75
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,070
and was saved by Mr. Zhang’s men.

76
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:11,070
Otherwise, I wouldn’t be able to be here.

77
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,160
If you still doubt me,

78
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,200
I have the recording of
our previous conversations.

79
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:29,780
- Mr. Qin... - Shut up!

80
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,540
Uh...

81
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:31,880
- Mr. Qin, he... - Be quiet!

82
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:33,950
- Well... - Get the hell out!

83
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:34,940
Mr. Qin.

84
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:35,980
Mr. Qin.

85
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,860
Out!

86
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:38,600
Let’s go.

87
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,320
Ziqian,

88
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,040
this is the whole truth.

89
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,790
Are you still going to sign the contract?

90
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,350
Ziqian,

91
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:57,440
my father started this whole thing.

92
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:58,830
I apologize for him.

93
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,670
But what happened before wasn’t a conspiracy.

94
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,230
My father would never kill his best friend.

95
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,160
Xu Ziqian,

96
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,390
don’t destroy your fathers’ legacies.

97
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,830
Ziqian,

98
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:12,550
give up.

99
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,070
Don’t sign it.

100
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,830
I’m sure you won’t believe

101
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,510
their chicanery,

102
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:33,320
right?

103
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,320
Sign it.

104
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,920
No, Ziqian.

105
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:37,760
Ziqian!

106
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,040
Xu Ziqian!

107
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,270
Ziqian, don’t!

108
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,920
Whoever tries to stop the signing

109
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,880
will have to answer to my gun.

110
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,510
Mr. Xu,

111
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,440
if they dare stop you,

112
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,640
I’ll take care of them.

113
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,480
Sign it.

114
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,780
What if we don’t?

115
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,640
Then no one can leave!

116
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:55,000
Still no news from Junhao?

117
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,160
He said he’d call me after he arrived,

118
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,160
but nothing yet.

119
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,950
I’ll call him

120
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,120
to see what’s going on.

121
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,150
- Sure. - OK.

122
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:25,600
Anything?

123
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:27,720
No answer.

124
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,270
Let me call Yunyi.

125
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:39,440
No answer, either.

126
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:44,110
Taichu didn’t pick up his phone.

127
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,150
What’s going on?

128
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,200
Neither did Ziqian.

129
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,280
Dawei is with Zhang Minghan.

130
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,400
Let me try his phone.

131
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,710
Again, no answer.

132
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,200
Did something happen to them?

133
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,130
I heard from insiders

134
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,520
that Mr. Qin of Marv

135
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,080
is well-connected.

136
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,470
Will he give them a hard time?

137
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,000
I’ll go check.

138
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:25,910
Hold on.

139
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,790
It’s dangerous for you to go there alone.

140
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:30,590
Yes. They’re all there.

141
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:31,520
Just stay.

142
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,520
Don’t worry.

143
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,080
I’ve never got myself in danger.

144
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,150
Mr. Xu,

145
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,110
my patience is running out.

146
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:48,790
Sign it.

147
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,280
I get it.

148
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,520
You’re hesitant because I didn’t get rid of

149
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,080
all these distractions, right?

150
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:32,670
Ziqian!

151
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,880
Shan Junhao!

152
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Shan Junhao.

153
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,280
Who do you think you are?

154
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,400
You think you’re above me

155
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,520
and can boss me around?

156
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,960
You’ve always been like this.

157
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,400
You have a problem with everything I do.

158
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,440
Now, I’m in charge.

159
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,640
Don’t you interfere!

160
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,230
Ziqian, are you crazy?

161
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,520
I’m only crazy

162
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,110
because of you!

163
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:14,470
Didn’t you claim

164
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:16,320
that Shan Yaolong

165
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,760
killed my father?

166
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,640
Now, you said he didn’t.

167
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,550
Is this a game?

168
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,470
Weren’t you eager

169
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:27,760
to be in charge of Senwell

170
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,030
but failed?

171
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,230
So is this your payback?

172
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,230
Xu Ziqian,

173
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,670
they grew up with you like brothers.

174
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,470
What you said is hurtful.

175
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,710
It’s among the three of us.

176
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:41,550
Stay out of it!

177
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,710
You people are ridiculous!

178
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,350
You all believe you’re saviors

179
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,320
who can help me out, don’t you?

180
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:57,880
Listen,

181
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,350
in my eyes,

182
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,520
you’re nothing!

183
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,640
Ziqian!

184
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,400
And you...

185
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,760
Drop your act.

186
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,230
Stop manipulating me

187
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,470
or controlling me in the name of caring.

188
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,640
Get out of my face!

189
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,200
What are you saying?

190
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,760
Mr. Qin.

191
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,030
Let them leave.

192
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,200
I don’t want to see them.

193
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,640
Why are you still here?

194
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:48,840
Get out!

195
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,910
I said get out!

196
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,150
Out!

197
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,760
Watch closely.

198
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:06,000
Nobody can get in,

199
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,960
or we’ll all be doomed.

200
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,110
- Yes. - Yes.

201
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:19,640
Excuse me.

202
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:21,840
What’s wrong?

203
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:31,280
Mr. Xu,

204
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,960
you’re a good actor.

205
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,840
You almost fooled me.

206
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,520
Oh, my god.

207
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,200
I’ll give you

208
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,960
an Oscar award!

209
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:44,790
Why did you act so hard?

210
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,550
Just so they could get out alive, right?

211
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,910
No one can leave

212
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,200
until the contract is signed.

213
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,440
Stop pacing back and forth.

214
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:05,760
You’re making me dizzy.

215
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,400
Everything is fine.

216
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,230
Don’t panic.

217
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,350
I have a bad feeling.

218
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,840
Whenever Qianyu was in trouble,

219
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,400
I’d feel the same way.

220
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,910
So many of them are there.

221
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,550
Nothing will happen.

222
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:27,910
You’re no better.

223
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:30,200
Look at you!

224
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,470
You almost broke your nails.

225
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,710
Did I?

226
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:24,860
= Signature: Party A: Party B: =

227
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,460
= Party A: =

228
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:36,840
Pizza delivery.

229
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,640
Bring it in.

230
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,110
Mr. Qin!

231
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,710
Mr. Shan,

232
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:25,200
it’s loaded.

233
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:29,200
Qianyu, are you alright?

234
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,520
I’m fine.

235
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,110
Qianyu, what are you doing here?

236
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,320
Without me, what would you do?

237
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,910
You still have to depend on me.

238
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:39,400
Mr. Qin,

239
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,440
I collected enough evidence

240
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,760
of Marv’s money laundering business

241
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,280
and handed it to the police.

242
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,710
This can prove Marv is guilty of money laundering.

243
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,320
It took me a while to get it.

244
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,880
Those foreign banks

245
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,470
are difficult to get in.

246
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,230
My hacker friends and I

247
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,960
worked tirelessly for days to access it.

248
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,200
So, you know...

249
00:16:59,080 --> 00:16:59,960
Rest assured.

250
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,590
Mr. Zhang will pay for it.

251
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,920
We have to submit them all to the police.

252
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,710
The police are on their way.

253
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,640
What?

254
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:14,680
Don’t move.

255
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:20,400
Ziqian,

256
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,680
now you see his true color.

257
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,800
You’ve got the evidence

258
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,000
and called the police.

259
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,350
Senwell won’t be affected too much.

260
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,560
Why did you still take such a risk

261
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,520
to stop me?

262
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:34,000
To save you.

263
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,190
Mr. Shan and the others all knew

264
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,040
if you signed that contract,

265
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,190
you’d be implicated in Marv’s crime.

266
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,230
- Qianyu! - Qianyu!

267
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:54,040
Let go of her!

268
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,520
Let go of her!

269
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,350
Mr. Shan,

270
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,710
drop the gun.

271
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,760
Don’t bluff!

272
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,040
You called the cops?

273
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,040
What do you want?

274
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,560
You told the cops?

275
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,470
I’ll kill you all here today!

276
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:12,950
Qianyu!

277
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,070
Qianyu!

278
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,000
Qianyu!

279
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,070
Qianyu!

280
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,350
Qianyu! Wake up!

281
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:21,920
Qianyu!

282
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,800
Qianyu!

283
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:26,880
Wake up!

284
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,430
Qianyu!

285
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:37,020
= Mr. Qin is suspected of illegal possession of
guns, forced transactions, money laundering =

286
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,900
= and other crimes and he’s under investigation. =

287
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,220

00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,620
= and are under investigation, too. =

290
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,590
Qianyu’s been unconscious for three days.

291
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,430
Why hasn’t she woken up?

292
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:39,040
Mama Jinzhi,

293
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,040
calm down.

294
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,190
The doctor said she’s fine.

295
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,640
She’ll be awake soon.

296
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,350
She’s probably catching up with her sleep.

297
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,350
She’ll wake up.

298
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:55,230
Yes.

299
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,280
I’m sure she’ll be fine.

300
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,190
Can’t Qianyu have any good luck?

301
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,760
Ever since you two met,

302
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,760
she’s been injured more than once.

303
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,280
Aunt Jinzhi,

304
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:11,620
I’m sorry.

305
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,980
Hadn’t it been for me,

306
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,500
she wouldn’t have got hurt.

307
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,680
Junhao,

308
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,070
don’t worry too much.

309
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,800
The doctor said she’ll soon wake up.

310
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,180
Yes.

311
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:42,350
You stay and take care of her.

312
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,350
I’ll watch the company.

313
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,140
OK.

314
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:50,700
Junhao,

315
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,590
I’m sorry.

316
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,140
Alright. Enough of that.

317
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:02,280
It’s over.

318
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:06,230
Qianyu got injured.

319
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,680
Your relationship was leaked to the press.

320
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,350
And you got hurt at your wedding.

321
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,070
They were all because of me.

322
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:16,160
Back then,

323
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,800
I didn’t want Yunyi

324
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,680
to marry you.

325
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,520
I hated you

326
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,950
for hurting her.

327
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:31,560
I hated your father for my father’s death.

328
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,350
It’s all my fault.

329
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,400
I’m really sorry.

330
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:48,470
I understand why you did such things.

331
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:51,680
I did make mistakes.

332
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:53,980
And I should apologize to you.

333
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,000
Can you two

334
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:01,680
stop apologizing to each other?

335
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,670
I’m getting goose bumps.

336
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,110
It’s gross.

337
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,920
I’ve signed

338
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,280
this equity transfer agreement.

339
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,760
Half of the shares

340
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,830
belong to your father.

341
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:22,920
You should keep them.

342
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:28,590
My father

343
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:30,430
already gave them to Uncle Shan,

344
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,760
so they aren’t mine.

345
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,260
He was never greedy

346
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:38,710
or a workaholic.

347
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,560
Without that accident,

348
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:48,070
he’d be living a carefree life now.

349
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:54,560
My father was responsible for that accident.

350
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,000
Let bygones be bygones.

351
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,160
After Ye Qianyu recovers,

352
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:07,230
I’d like to take a rest.

353
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:09,590
Where are you going?

354
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:14,860
To finish my father’s overdue trip.

355
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,220
Yunyi.

356
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,380
What about you?

357
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:27,350
I’ll go with Ziqian.

358
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,280
But now,

359
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,520
I only hope Qianyu can wake up soon.

360
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:34,470
What?

361
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:37,530
You two are going to travel?

362
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,070
Count me in.

363
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:47,280
Where are you going?

364
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,280
You can only stay here.

365
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,040
General Manager of Senwell

366
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,310
has no vacations.

367
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:57,640
General Manager?

368
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:03,190
Being both Chairman and General Manager

369
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:04,560
is too much for me.

370
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,760
Besides,

371
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,590
after what we went through,

372
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,950
I believe you’re qualified

373
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:10,880
for that position.

374
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,880
Zhang Minghan.

375
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,950
Your wish has finally come true.

376
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:18,230
Congratulations, Mr. Zhang!

377
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,520
By the way,

378
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,190
Director Xu, Director Fan.

379
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:23,230
As the General Manager,

380
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,230
I won’t give you a long vacation.

381
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,760
A few days are enough.

382
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,160
Come back to work after that.

383
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,910
Yes, Mr. Zhang.

384
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,400
Alright. See you later.

385
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,560
We’re leaving.

386
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,710
Take good care of Qianyu.

387
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:42,880
Bye.

388
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:52,430
Junhao,

389
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:53,470
Qianyu is awake!

390
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,350
Qianyu, you’re finally awake!

391
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:58,920
We’re all worried sick.

392
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,470
Qianyu.

393
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,400
How do you feel? Does your head hurt?

394
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,280
Are you feeling OK?

395
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:02,950
What do you want to eat?

396
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,190
Name it, and I’ll buy it.

397
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:05,110
What would you like to drink?

398
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,280
Guys, be quiet,

399
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,760
or my head will ache.

400
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:09,350
Fine.

401
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,060
We’ll stop.

402
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:10,660
We’ll be quiet.

403
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:12,920
Qianyu!

404
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,680
You’re up.

405
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:17,190
Who are you?

406
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:21,310
I’m Shan Junhao.

407
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,040
Who’s Shan Junhao?

408
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,400
Shan Junhao is also Tonghao.

409
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:29,040
And who is that?

410
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:32,520
Tonghao is your boyfriend.

411
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,160
I’m single.

412
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,180
= File Bag =

413
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:40,470
Qianyu,

414
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:43,470
you... You know who I am?

415
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:44,470
You...

416
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,920
You’re the famous scrooge in Guanmei,

417
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,760
Chen Jinzhi.

418
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,430
What about me? Who am I?

419
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,070
You’re the greedy devil Ye Shengzhe.

420
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,760
What about me?

421
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,710
You’re Tang who wants to chase Chen back.

422
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:02,470
You remember me?

423
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:03,220
Yeah.

424
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,920
You’re Prince Charming of Guanmei, Taichu.

425
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,350
You only forgot me.

426
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,040
You look familiar, though.

427
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,590
Who am I?

428
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,950
Don’t know.

429
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,830
Well,

430
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,430
you do look hot.

431
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,110
Nice to meet you, handsome.

432
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:35,680
I’m Ye Qianyu.

433
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,040
Good to see you here.

434
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,860
= Money Bag Grocery =

435
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,920
Why is this happening to Qianyu?

436
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:52,280
She and Tonghao were finally together

437
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,710
but she lost her memory.

438
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:55,350
It’s odd.

439
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:56,920
She remembers everyone

440
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,230
except Tonghao.

441
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,230
Good things always happen last.

442
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,230
Their lives are so bumpy.

443
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,710
Junhao,

444
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,400
what’s your plan next?

445
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,760
I forgot her once

446
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:22,760
and broke her heart.

447
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,230
This is probably the payback.

448
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,710
Whether she will regain her memory or not,

449
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,760
I won’t give her up.

450
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,760
Be careful.

451
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,310
She still remembers Taichu.

452
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,680
I’m not cut out to be a pianist.

453
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,520
I’ve practiced this piece many times

454
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,520
but still can’t master it.

455
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:18,430
You can divide it into a few sections

456
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:20,310
and practice one repeatedly every day.

457
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,190
After some time,

458
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,560
you can finish the whole piece.

459
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,800
I made this special score for you.

460
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,830
Fingerings are marked

461
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:32,110
on the difficulty parts.

462
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,310
Here you are.

463
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:36,880
Thanks.

464
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,780
Remember to practice it every day.

465
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:45,070
I always like

466
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:48,190
cabriolet guy.

467
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:51,620
Mama Jinzhi.

468
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:58,430
You already took my bracelet.

469
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:04,070
I can give it back to you.

470
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:07,070
My daughter should have more choices.

471
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,000
Fine. As long as you can take it off,

472
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,110
you can return it.

473
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:17,590
You couldn’t remove it before.

474
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:18,590
Now, you’ve gained weight.

475
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,880
How can you do it?

476
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:20,520
I...

477
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:22,160
I didn’t gain weight.

478
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:24,680
I’m… Still attractive.

479
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,220
No.

480
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,590
I also think you’re chubby.

481
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:30,760
When you weighted yourself yesterday,

482
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,680
I saw the number.

483
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:32,830
You do look plump.

484
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:33,950
Don’t deny it.

485
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,920
So what?

486
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:42,430
I’ll take it off. I...

487
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,110
Go ahead.

488
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:45,350
Enough.

489
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:47,070
Stop torturing your hand,

490
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:47,880
OK?

491
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,160
Look, it’s all red.

492
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,880
Qianyu,

493
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:02,430
save some time for yourself every day.

494
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:04,950
Don’t work around the clock.

495
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,760
You should love yourself more.

496
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:19,950
I’m leaving.

497
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,070
Goodbye.

498
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:01,310
Taichu.

499
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:05,350
Are you waiting for me?

500
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,470
No.

501
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,760
I’m watching the store.

502
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:12,280
OK. Go on.

503
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,350
I’m off.

504
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:16,710
Where are you going?

505
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:20,350
Not important.

506
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,280
If you promise

507
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,520
to love Ye Qianyu forever,

508
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,280
I may not be back again.

509
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,560
I’ll cherish her indeed.

510
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:34,520
You said that to me once,

511
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:36,560
yet failed to keep your promise.

512
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,880
I lost my memory.

513
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,500
You’re fine now.

514
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:45,900
Please take good care of her.

515
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:52,920
Well, I’m leaving.

516
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,520
Wait.

517
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,070
What’s wrong?

518
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,280
Thanks.

519
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,230
For what?

520
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,310
Thank you.

521
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:26,560
Yes, it’s her.

522
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:32,860
She’s a good singer.

523
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:39,430
It’s beautiful.

524
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,470
Is it good?

525
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,470
- Good. - Amazing!

526
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:02,880
Yunyi,

527
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,560
it’s a wonderful guitar.

528
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,070
The sound is amazing!

529
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:08,230
I love it.

530
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,390
Thank you.

531
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:11,040
I should thank you.

532
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:12,390
Xiaoge,

533
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,470
thank you for being with me

534
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:16,710
in my darkest moments.

535
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:20,080
I’m sure from now on,

536
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,760
you won’t experience any darkness again.

537
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,800
What are you doing?

538
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:46,000
Sis,

539
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,710
can I skip school?

540
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,560
You’re a good cube player.

541
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,910
How come you can’t

542
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:54,630
do your homework?

543
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:58,140
Cube is a game of skills,

544
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:01,820
while homework is a combination of words,

545
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:03,320
numbers

546
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,390
and luck.

547
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,630
I can’t outplay our teachers.

548
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:09,910
Buddy,

549
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:12,840
don’t give up at crisis,

550
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,840
and you’ll find hope in desperate situation.

551
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:17,540
You can do it!

552
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,120
I can do it!

553
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,560
Continue.

554
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,630
Junhao said

555
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:53,470
you and Yunyi are leaving soon.

556
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,470
We’re going to Norway.

557
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:59,970
Yunyi fancies the aurora there.

558
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:07,180
I want nothing else other than seeing you

559
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,340
be happy.

560
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:17,340
Our family owes you too much.

561
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,300
It’s OK

562
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:22,180
if you hate us.

563
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,940
But in my heart,

564
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,560
you’ll always be my son.

565
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,120
The past is the past.

566
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,670
All these years,

567
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:43,140
you’ve always regarded me

568
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:45,940
as your own son.

569
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,060
I’m forever in debt to you

570
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,660
for raising me so well.

571
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:58,220
Wherever you are,

572
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,300
don’t forget to call me and tell me you’re safe.

573
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,460
If you’re homesick,

574
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:07,500
I’ll always wait for you at home.

575
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,630
OK.

576
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:17,420
Mom.

577
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:36,280
Don’t cry, Mom.

578
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,600
Where are we going?

579
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:55,620
Devil Forest.

580
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:57,430
Why?

581
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:59,540
To find your lost memory.

582
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:06,190
That place marks the start of our relationship.

583
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:08,670
It’ll help you remember the past.

584
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:13,360
Back then, you fell in the heavenly pit

585
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,040
and we spent the night there together.

586
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:17,520
Now,

587
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,190
you can do it again

588
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:23,430
and we’ll relive the whole scene together.

589
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:25,600
I don’t want to sprain my ankle again!

590
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,430
What’s wrong?

591
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:45,630
How long do you plan to fool me?

592
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:47,630
You little liar!

593
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,840
I...

594
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:09,780
= Six Months Later =

595
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,520

596
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:18,920

Welcome.

599

Congratulations, Mrs. Shan!

600
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,020
- Congratulations! - Thanks. Thank you.

601
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,560
- Mr. Tang. - Right this way.

602
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,250
- Welcome. - This way, please.

603
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:28,000
You’re a big boy now.

604
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,180
Hello.

605
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,670
You’re as young as before.

606
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:33,970
- This way, please. - Welcome.

607
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,940
- Welcome. - Congratulations!

608
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:36,560
Have a seat inside.

609
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,460
- Congratulations, Mrs. Shan!
- Thank you. This way, please.

610
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:39,340
This way.

611
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:41,660
You’re so cool today, Shengzhe.

612
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:42,270
This way.

613
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,600
- Congratulations! - Is she pregnant?

614
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,520
Yeah.

615
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:00,000
Wow!

616
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,430
Dadao posted something on Weibo.

617
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:04,080
His last post was six months ago.

618
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,470
Let me see.

619
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:20,060
= The world is beautiful
because you’re the center of it. =

620
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,630
Congratulations, Mrs. Shan!

621
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:30,560
Welcome. This way, please.

622
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:31,840
Take a seat inside.

623
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:36,840
Yunyi!

624
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,470
Mom!

625
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:39,230
When did you come back?

626
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:42,000
How could I miss my brother’s wedding?

627
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,230
Ziqian.

628
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:43,760
Mom.

629
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:44,860
You’re back.

630
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:47,910
Congratulations, Ms. Chen and Mr. Tang.

631
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:49,430
Thank you.

632
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:50,340
Thanks.

633
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,710
Congratulations, Mom.

634
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,240
- Congratulations, Tang. - Mom,

635
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,340
Ziqian and I

636
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,320
got married in Las Vegas.

637
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:57,610
- Congratulations, Mr. Tang. - Really?

638
00:40:57,610 --> 00:40:58,310
Congratulations!

639
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,440
This way, please.

640
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,080
Ziqian,

641
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,710
we’re officially a family.

642
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,560
- I promise - Congratulations!

643
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,280
I’ll take good care of Yunyi.

644
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:08,320
I know I can

645
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,800
entrust her to you.

646
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,870
Alright, go wait inside.

647
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:13,710
I’ll soon join you.

648
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:14,760
OK.

649
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:18,600
Bring your mom with you

650
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,910
when you travel again.

651
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:21,950
- Congratulations to you! - Of course.

652
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:22,880
- Your wedding - You’re married?

653
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,600
- should be prepared soon. - Thanks.

654
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,770
You owe us a meal.

655
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:26,080
It’s your turn next time.

656
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:27,710
I won’t wear these.

657
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:30,190
I couldn’t walk in these on the flat ground,

658
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,150
let alone on the beach.

659
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:32,120
I’ll die.

660
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:32,820
I won’t wear them!

661
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:33,600
No way in hell!

662
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,870
All brides wear high heels!

663
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,040
Besides,

664
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:39,800
you’re much shorter than him.

665
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,560
High heels can close the gap.

666
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:42,910
Come on!

667
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:43,910
Here.

668
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:45,190
I won’t wear high heels

669
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:46,560
or any shoes.

670
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,190
Walking on the beach with bare feet

671
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:49,710
is so good.

672
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:51,230
Look, Qianyu,

673
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:53,150
you only get married once.

674
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,360
The groom

675
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,800
is that “lady’s man”, Shan Junhao.

676
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,230
You need to think for him.

677
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:00,800
He’s marrying me

678
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,950
not high heels.

679
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:02,710
I won’t wear them!

680
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:05,150
You’re so stubborn.

681
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,600
My brother loves

682
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:07,870
whatever you do.

683
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,120
Hi, Yunyi.

684
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,870
Hello, my sister-in-law.

685
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:15,000
Don’t give me, your sister-in-law
a hard time after getting married.

686
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:20,120
Hey my dear sister-in-law,
I’m hungry.

687
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:24,560
Your mom doesn’t allow you

688
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:26,760
to eat anything before the wedding.

689
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,470
She fears your dress will be torn.

690
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:35,360
I’ll get you some cupcakes.

691
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,890
You’re the best!

692
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:52,600
Qianyu,

693
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:55,870
congratulations.

694
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,880
This body, this look,

695
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,320
and this suit.

696
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,120
Perfect.

697
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,000
Junhao,

698
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:26,470
you’re that Snow...

699
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,280
No, I mean Prince Charming.

700
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:31,190
Perfect.

701
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,320
You’ll be on the cover again tomorrow,

702
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,360
Shan Junhao.

703
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:51,470
Welcome back.

704
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:54,870
I came straight from the airport

705
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,710
and I’m still jet-legged.

706
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:01,800
Glad to see you back.

707
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:03,320
So does Mom.

708
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:06,600
I’m already married

709
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:09,190
and can’t be your best man.

710
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:12,460
Why didn’t you tell Mom and me?

711
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,760
When we were abroad,

712
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:15,840
we didn’t think too much.

713
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:16,910
Just jumped on the moment

714
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,120
and did it.

715
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:25,000
Congratulations.

716
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:26,840
Thanks.

717
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:31,260
By the way,

718
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,280
where’s my ring? Is it ready?

719
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,360
Relax. I got it.

720
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:44,190
What’s wrong?

721
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,320
It’s not here.

722
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,520
I... I... I remember it.

723
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,800
I changed my suit before leaving.

724
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,000
It... It was in that suit.

725
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:04,470
Look,

726
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:06,520
my engagement failed.

727
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:07,840
So did my wedding.

728
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,230
How could you drop the ball the third time?

729
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,860
Come on, Dawei.

730
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:16,360
Did you do that on purpose?

731
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:21,000
You want Shan Junhao to be alone forever?

732
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,950
I... I’d never do that.

733
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:24,320
I...

734
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,520
How about... I go back to get it?

735
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:29,360
I’ll go get it.

736
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:29,910
Wait.

737
00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:31,910
The wedding is about to begin in ten minutes.

738
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:33,360
You don’t have wings.

739
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:37,040
What to do?

740
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:37,800
I have an idea.

741
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:39,180
Go borrow one.

742
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:42,630
That’s the only option.

743
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:43,870
Borrow it?

744
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:47,360
From... From whom?

745
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:48,800
I’ll do it.

746
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:51,320
I’ll find one.

747
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:01,360
Stop laughing.

748
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,150
He can do it.

749
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:12,800
Stop it!

750
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:15,710
- Please. - This way, please.

751
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,040
- Congratulations, Mr. Tang. - Right this way.

752
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:18,540
- Please. - Have a seat.

753
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:19,910
Thank you.

754
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,600
Shengzhe, you’re adorable!

755
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:29,760
Enough.

756
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:30,910
Jinzhi,

757
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:32,040
Mrs. Shan.

758
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:33,320
This...

759
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:36,470
I made these napkins.

760
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,870
Here you are, Jinzhi and Mrs. Shan.

761
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:39,950
My turn, my turn.

762
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:42,910
- Aunt Jinzhi, Mrs. Shan. - Thank you.

763
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:45,870
Qianyu and Tonghao went through a lot.

764
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:47,080
So,

765
00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:49,280
I prepared

766
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,320
this apple for them.

767
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:55,280
May they be safe and happy forever.

768
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:56,620
My turn!

769
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:58,140
Congratulations!

770
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:00,950
It hurts!

771
00:47:01,390 --> 00:47:03,280
Why do you always give others durians?

772
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:04,910
I meant to give Tonghao

773
00:47:04,910 --> 00:47:06,190
a big one last time

774
00:47:06,670 --> 00:47:07,470
but didn’t get to.

775
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:08,840
He’s getting one this time.

776
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:12,360
The smell is too strong.

777
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:15,450
Congratulations!

778
00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:21,960
Jinzhi!

779
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:31,230
Take it, grab it.

780
00:47:31,230 --> 00:47:32,470
Fine, I’ll hold it.

781
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:37,200
Is there a buffet?

782
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:42,980
- Let’s go. - Let’s go.

783
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:44,910
Come on.

784
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:46,900
Take it inside.

785
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,670
Is the cooking better than mine?

786
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:50,280
Go, go, go.

787
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:53,710
What are those?

788
00:47:54,390 --> 00:47:54,910
Take it!

789
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:57,840
They’re bringing us so much joy.

790
00:47:58,470 --> 00:48:00,380
- Too much. - Yeah.

791
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,490
Are you tired, Shengzhe?

792
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:04,210
Congratulations!

793
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:04,750
- I’m fine. - This way, please.

794
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:06,170
Welcome. Please take a seat.

795
00:48:06,170 --> 00:48:06,800
Thanks.

796
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:12,670
I... Need... A ring.

797
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:14,080
What ring?

798
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,880
Mr.... Mr. Shan

799
00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:18,080
doesn’t have the ring.

800
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:18,840
- Huh? - What?

801
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,040
He doesn’t have the ring?

802
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:21,980
Uh...

803
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,780
Where is it?

804
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:26,080
How could they get married without it?

805
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:27,190
I... Uh...

806
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:31,120
Mrs. Shan, your ring...

807
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:31,950
Mrs. Shan,

808
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:33,040
what’s going on?

809
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,950
No ring, no wedding, OK?

810
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:36,080
So insincere!

811
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:36,820
No...

812
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:37,840
My poor girl!

813
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,120
Jinzhi, listen to me.

814
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:40,280
I won’t! I won’t! I won’t!

815
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:41,080
Chen Jinzhi!

816
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:44,520
I hired the best designer

817
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:46,670
to customize a 5.21-carat diamond ring

818
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:49,000
based on Ye Qianyu’s birthday.

819
00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:50,630
How come it’s gone?

820
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:54,780
5.21-carat?

821
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,150
Is it the size of a pigeon’s egg?

822
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:00,980
Yes!

823
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:01,700
Of course.

824
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,670
How come there’s no ring?

825
00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:06,630
Mrs. Shan, your ring...

826
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:07,600
Where is it?

827
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:08,390
Show us.

828
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,190
Where’s the pigeon’s egg?

829
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:11,150
Pigeon’s egg... I...

830
00:49:11,150 --> 00:49:12,150
Dawei, where is it?

831
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:14,190
It... Well...

832
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:15,430
Mrs. Shan...

833
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:17,820
No ring, no wedding!

834
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:18,700
Cancel it!

835
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:20,870
Dawei, go find it!

836
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:22,120
Go ahead!

837
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:23,280
I can’t... I can’t find it.

838
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,190
Go!

839
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:26,470
Mrs. Shan, I...

840
00:49:27,470 --> 00:49:28,950
Find carefully! Hurry!

841
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,960
No ring, no wedding!

842
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,760
- We have the ring. - Diamond ring!

843
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:42,140
I’ve never been to a beach wedding before.

844
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:43,140
- Me neither. - Really?

845
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:47,500
= Shan & Ye =

846
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,670
It’s Qianyu!

847
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:08,520
Isn’t she gorgeous?

848
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:10,140
- So pretty! - Beautiful!

849
00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:12,840
Shengzhe, you can’t bully your sister again.

850
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:44,950
Are you alright?

851
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:45,800
I’m fine.

852
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:52,760
