Congratulations on Qianyu’s first day to work!

12
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,440
My daughter looks

13
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,230
like an office lady in this suit.

14
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,550
Ye Qianyu,

15
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,360
this outfit covers your violent nature

16
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,870
successfully.

17
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,080
As long as you don’t speak,

18
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,080
you’re safe.

19
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,230
Don’t say that!

20
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:02,720
Qianyu,

21
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,550
we’re so proud of you

22
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,590
that you can

23
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,320
work in Senwell.

24
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,470
Indeed.

25
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,720
Qianyu, I made these dumplings for you.

26
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,190
After eating them,

27
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,750
you’ll have

28
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,080
no trouble at all in the future.

29
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,830
Qianyu, Qianyu, I made some, too.

30
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,020
These dumplings are delicious, Master.

31
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,000
Qianyu,

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,750
once you’re in Senwell,

33
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,360
remember to study hard.

34
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,360
The future of our inn depends on you,

35
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:36,670
Qianyu.

36
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,880
Taichu has arrived.

37
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,440
See you.

38
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,870
Take care. Be careful.

39
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,270
Have a nice day.

40
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,260
Slowly, slowly.

41
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,320
She looks sharp.

42
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:47,750
She looks good in the suit.

43
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,960
Taichu, do I look OK?

44
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,080
Confidence is the best armor.

45
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:53,630
Let’s go.

46
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,550
Taichu is driving her to work?

47
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,670
He’d never let her go there alone.

48
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,550
You’re right.

49
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,000
Bye, guys.

50
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,190
Uh...

51
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,910
Qianyu,

52
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,550
when you’re at work,

53
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:13,720
remember to eat properly.

54
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,550
I will.

55
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,630
Taichu.

56
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,520
Please take good care of her.

57
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,440
She’s never worked

58
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,910
so far away from home.

59
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,520
I will, Mama Jinzhi.

60
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,750
Alright, Chen.

61
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,160
Don’t be so dramatic.

62
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,600
Senwell

63
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,440
is only an hour’s drive.

64
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,320
It’s not like I’ll be gone forever.

65
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:31,550
OK.

66
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,390
We gotta go.

67
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,600
Qianyu, Qianyu. Take this.

68
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,440
Don’t forget the dumplings.

69
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,440
Thank you, Chef.

70
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,240
Bye.

71
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,000
Bye.

72
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,550
Mr. Shan, we’ve received GQ’s funds,

73
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,520
but they still have doubts about the project.

74
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,110
Or, they wouldn’t have sent Taichu to oversee it.

75
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,670
They trust him.

76
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,630
What if he doesn’t disagree with us?

77
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,550
I’ll take care of that.

78
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:00,600
OK.

79
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,440
Welcome back, Mr. Zhang.

80
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,720
Like I said,

81
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,790
I’d never do anything harmful

82
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:17,950
to Senwell.

83
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,550
Mr. Qiu and Mr. Lin’s own doing

84
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:22,480
has nothing to do with me.

85
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,760
Hope we can make a good team.

86
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,620
Mr. Shan.

87
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,390
Welcome, Taichu.

88
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,550
This meeting is for Senwell and GQ

89
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,320
to discuss development details together.

90
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,170
What’s the member of Guanmei Inn

91
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:44,940
doing here?

92
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,550
Let me introduce to you,

93
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:49,270
my assistant, Ye Qianyu.

94
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,320
Hello, I’m Ye Qianyu.

95
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,820
I’m honored to be here.

96
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,760
Senwell has minimum requirements

97
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,390
for assistants.

98
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:04,780
Dawei.

99
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,440
I think you know the details.

100
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,320
Yes, boss.

101
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,640
First,

102
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:13,720
a master’s degree or above.

103
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,220
Overseas study experience is preferred.

104
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,600
Second,

105
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,640
at least three years of work experience,

106
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,000
preferably in listed companies.

107
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,040
Third,

108
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:25,200
CET 6 or above.

109
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,270
Sorry,

110
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,200
Ye Qianyu is my special assistant.

111
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,140
My standards are different

112
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:30,970
from Senwell’s.

113
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,440
First,

114
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,950
I don’t think diploma is the only standard

115
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:34,880
Check this one.

116
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,070
to assess a candidate

117
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,320
but his or her ability to learn.

118
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,640
Besides, isn’t this project

119
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,550
about the development of Guanmei Fishing Village?

120
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:43,550
It’s only natural

121
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:44,920
to have its representative to sit in.

122
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,230
More importantly,

123
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,510
I believe Miss Ye Qianyu

124
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,600
is more than capable for this job.

125
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,510
Thanks.

126
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,950
Let’s begin.

127
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,510
Guanmei Fishing Village is rich in natural

128
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,480
and ecological resources.

129
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,160
We’ll build a high-end resort

130
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,760
from east to west on the island.

131
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,790
There will be a theme park, a nature park,

132
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:15,200
a water world and a duty-free shopping mall.

133
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,440
Guanmei Fishing Village

134
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,920
will become a one-stop resort for tourists.

135
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,640
The village isn’t too big

136
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,320
but it’s conveniently located.

137
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,350
It’s only an hour’s drive

138
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,000
from the city center,

139
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,760
so it can attract both the locals

140
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,200
and those outside the city.

141
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:34,760
Hence,

142
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,160
we need to calculate the maximum capacity.

143
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,350
According to the estimation,

144
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,640
we expect

145
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,200
about 30,000 visitors per day.

146
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,510
Before the construction,

147
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,600
I suggest we design

148
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,320
the MI,

149
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:47,880
BI

150
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,880
and VI first for the village.

151
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,830
A slogan is also needed.

152
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,720
It’s essential

153
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,880
for the image-building.

154
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,000
Ye Qianyu,

155
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,880
you’re a local.

156
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,230
Do you have any suggestions?

157
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:01,110
Me?

158
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,790
Well... Uh...

159
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:10,200
What does VI mean?

160
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,350
VI means visual identification.

161
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,040
It’s an image or symbol

162
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:27,000
that makes one thing different from the others.

163
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:30,230
For example, when you see a yellow “M”,

164
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,760
you instantly know it’s McDonald’s.

165
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,230
I see.

166
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,790
We can use Chinese white dolphins

167
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,070
for this...

168
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,790
This visit...

169
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,070
Visual identification.

170
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,670
A cute white dolphin

171
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,440
must be appealing.

172
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,270
What about the slogan?

173
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,320
What do you mean?

174
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,950
Slogan can be a word or a phrase,

175
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,390
similar to an ad.

176
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:02,040
Just like McDonald’s “i’m lovin’ it”.

177
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,000
I understand.

178
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,350
I’ll tell tourists

179
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:08,600
come to Guanmei to see white dolphins.

180
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:13,270
If creating a slogan is that simple,

181
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,110
we can fire

182
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:17,510
all our copywriters.

183
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,200
Simplicity isn’t necessarily bad.

184
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,270
McDonald’s “i’m lovin’ it”,

185
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,070
Haagen-Dazs’s

186
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:27,230
“Lover her, treat her Haagen-Dazs”,

187
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,720
and Nike’s “Just do it” are all simple.

188
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,470
The key is to express the company’s vision

189
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,670
and the image of the village.

190
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,790
Mr. Zhang,

191
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:40,640
anything else you’d like to ask

192
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,110
about the development details?

193
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,470
I only care about the BEP.

194
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,760
I’ve done the calculation.

195
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,470
It’s 27.53%,

196
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,910
much lower than the 70% risk value,

197
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,670
which means development of Guanmei

198
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,590
is a typical low-risk project.

199
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,190
OK.

200
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,400
Let’s have a ten-minute recess.

201
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,440
I’ll buy coffee for you.

202
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,030
I’ll go.

203
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,200
I’m new here.

204
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,790
Drinks should be on me.

205
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:14,790
Uh... What would you like?

206
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:24,550
I’m not picky.

207
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,400
I’ll go with you.

208
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,150
No need. I can do it myself.

209
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:31,670
Thanks.

210
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,400
You can’t carry them all on your own.

211
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,550
Besides,

212
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,350
I’m familiar with everyone’s taste.

213
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:38,320
Thank you.

214
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:56,700
= The Minutes Presided by Shan Junhao =

215
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,470
Mr. Zhao.

216
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,880
May I ask you a question?

217
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,230
What does SWT mean?

218
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,150
You mean SWOT?

219
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,790
SWOT, S-W-O-T,

220
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,350
stands for Strengths, Weaknesses,

221
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,710
Opportunities, Threats.

222
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,960
It’s an abbreviation.

223
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,590
In another word, advantages and disadvantages,

224
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:20,400
chances and risks.

225
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:20,910
Analyzing every project

226
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,520
from those four aspects

227
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,200
can produce a relatively comprehensive,

228
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,470
systemic and accurate result.

229
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:30,000
What does “BEP” said by Mr. Zhang mean?

230
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,110
It stands for Break-Even Point,

231
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:34,230
where one earns matches what one spends.

232
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:36,960
Why did you

233
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,760
use so many fancy words during the meeting?

234
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,760
I was confused.

235
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,520
Senwell is a listed company

236
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,840
and most of our business is international.

237
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,840
The majority of the staff studied overseas,

238
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,150
so we use those jargon a lot.

239
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,590
I’ll make a list of the common jargon

240
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:50,760
and send it to you.

241
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,150
You can learn them yourself.

242
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,280
Thank you so much.

243
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,080
Thanks.

244
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,840
Here’s your coffee.

245
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,000
Ye Qianyu,

246
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,790
is this your minutes?

247
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,000
Yes.

248
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,760
See how other people did it.

249
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,710
That’s called professional.

250
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,110
Qianyu is new here

251
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:31,230
and doesn’t know much.

252
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,520
I’ll teach her bit by bit.

253
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,320
Consultant,

254
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,230
you’re surprisingly patient

255
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:38,880
with your assistant.

256
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,550
Of course.

257
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,910
Is that a problem?

258
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,790
Have some coffee.

259
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,200
Yes.

260
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,150
Take a coffee break.

261
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,760
Thanks.

262
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,590
You’re welcome.

263
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,910
Thanks.

264
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:17,350
I’m sorry, my bad.

265
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,320
I didn’t put it there on purpose.

266
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,570
Ye Qianyu,

267
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,080
when you’ll stop causing trouble?

268
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,280
I didn’t mean to do it.

269
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,150
Files I’m going to show
to our partner this afternoon

270
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,230
are on the laptop.

271
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,150
Do you have a backup?

272
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,320
No.

273
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,670
I just finished. Didn’t get to make a copy.

274
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:33,910
How come you’re a disaster

275
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,470
everywhere?

276
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:38,470
Junhao,

277
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,000
don’t blame her.

278
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It’s my fault.

279
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,640
I’m familiar with the content.

280
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,150
I can rewrite it quickly.

281
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:44,910
Director Fan.

282
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,840
Let’s bring the computer to IT department

283
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,150
and see if it can be repaired.

284
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,840
OK. Let’s go.

285
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,030
Sure.

286
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,080
Ye Qianyu,

287
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,350
I believe

288
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,110
you’ll bring Senwell

289
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:05,670
endless surprises.

290
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,670
Good luck!

291
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,790
She’s such a troublemaker.

292
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,790
Yes.

293
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,790
So clumsy.

294
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,840
Indeed.

295
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,200
She can’t handle such a small matter.

296
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,030
It’s OK.

297
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,230
Don’t worry too much.

298
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,030
Qianyu.

299
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,030
I apologize

300
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,520
that I wasn’t considerate enough.

301
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,000
Taichu.

302
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
You’ve done too much for me.

303
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,400
I’m not good enough.

304
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,440
Qianyu.

305
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,880
Don’t be discouraged.

306
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,840
I’m always with you

307
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,910
in Senwell.

308
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:10,710
Director Fan.

309
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,320
Consultant.

310
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,550
Director Fan. Director Xu.

311
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,470
Director Fan. How’s your laptop?

312
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,030
Don’t worry. It’s under repair,

313
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,960
but I can’t use it for the meeting this afternoon.

314
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,200
I’m really sorry.

315
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,230
It’s OK. I can redo it.

316
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:31,690
Consultant, I apologize

317
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,910
that your assistant was blamed

318
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,840
because of me.

319
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:37,280
I should be the one to apologize.

320
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,880
I don’t know much about Ye Qianyu,

321
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,200
but I think

322
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,280
she’s a smart girl.

323
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:50,320
I believe after professional training,

324
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,440
she’ll become an excellent assistant.

325
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,340
So I suggest

326
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,960
that Ye Qianyu

327
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,110
be trained in our Administration Department

328
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,590
for a while.

329
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,440
I can assign the best manager

330
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,320
to train her.

331
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,030
Once she completes the training

332
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,670
and comes back to work for you,

333
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:06,880
she’ll be of more help.

334
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,400
That’s unnecessary.

335
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:10,440
I can train my assistant well.

336
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,390
I will go.

337
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,840
Director Fan.

338
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,710
I want to go to the Administration Department.

339
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,280
Qianyu...

340
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,200
Taichu,

341
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,280
right now,

342
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,230
I’m unqualified for the job.

343
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,150
So I should improve myself

344
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,470
to become a better person.

345
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,440
Then I’ll be able to assist you

346
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,400
and work in Senwell.

347
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,670
If you insist,

348
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,440
I’ll support you.

349
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,550
Thanks.

350
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,390
Director Fan.

351
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:47,000
Can you take me to the Administration Department?

352
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:48,910
Consultant,

353
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,400
we’re leaving then.

354
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,150
Let’s go.

355
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,670
How could you be late

356
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:08,960
for the airport pickup?

357
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,710
You were supposed to arrive 40 minutes early,

358
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,080
and what you did?

359
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,550
You were two minutes late.

360
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,790
Don’t you know

361
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,790
Mr. Chen is an important ally?

362
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,520
If we offended him,

363
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,150
it would seriously affect our company’s business.

364
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,320
I’m sorry, Ada.

365
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:26,590
The traffic was bad and it was raining,

366
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:28,890
so I arrived two minutes late.

367
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:29,960
I’m really sorry.

368
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:31,760
If saying sorry can solve everything,

369
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,880
why bother making rules?

370
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,790
No monthly bonus for you.

371
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,590
Reflect on yourself.

372
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:40,440
Yes, Ada.

373
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,910
Director Fan. What brings you here?

374
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:46,880
This is Ye Qianyu,

375
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,350
Consultant Taichu’s assistant.

376
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,520
She’s new here

377
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,760
and isn’t familiar with our business.

378
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,670
I’d like you to coach her for a while.

379
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,760
Consultant Taichu’s assistant?

380
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,440
Sure. Entrust her to me.

381
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,620
I’ll teach her everything.

382
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,110
Qianyu.

383
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:05,310
Ada is a senior member.

384
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:07,520
You can ask her if you have any questions.

385
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,360
Study hard.

386
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,440
Thanks, Director Fan.

387
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,750
See you.

388
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,220
Sure, see you.

389
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,800
Hello, Ahda. My name is Ye Qianyu.

390
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,310
It’s Ada.

391
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,560
Sure, Ahda.

392
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,570
Yunyi.

393
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,520
Ziqian.

394
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,200
Let’s go have lunch together.

395
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,360
Sure. I’ll call Junhao.

396
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,160
No need.

397
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,160
He went to Senwell Hotel,
for a unannounced inspect.

398
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,350
The revenue continues to decline.

399
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,760
I’m sure it bothers him.

400
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,430
Why did you send Ye Qianyu

401
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,200
to the Administration Department?

402
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:02,000
To give her a chance to learn.

403
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:02,920
What’s wrong?

404
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:05,760
I know

405
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:07,350
you were afraid

406
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,950
if she continued to participate in the project,

407
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,470
she’d be too close to Junhao.

408
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,000
You have copies

409
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,350
of the files ruined this morning, right?

410
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,830
I know your work habits.

411
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:28,000
Ziqian.

412
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:32,160
You’ve become blunter.

413
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,190
I’m concerned about you.

414
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:42,560
Come on. Let’s go have lunch.

415
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,860

= Education Guanmei Community College =

417
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,400
You graduated from Guanmei Community College?

418
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,310
Yes.

419
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,590
Is there such a college?

420
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,230
Of course.

421
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:03,680
It’s famous in our village.

422
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:07,000
You used to work

423
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,430
as a tour guide and you delivered goods,

424
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:10,160
packages and food?

425
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:10,950
Yes.

426
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,830
Can you speak foreign languages?

427
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:16,560
Does “Hola” count?

428
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,000
How did you get to know Mr.Taichu?

429
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,800
He went to our village to travel,

430
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,520
and I was his tour guide.

431
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,400
That’s how we met.

432
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,800
Aren’t you lucky?

433
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:37,640
I’m strict

434
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,830
with all my staff members.

435
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,140
Follow me.

436
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,010
Come.

437
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:45,360
You first.

438
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,160
You blocked me.

= Janitor’s Room =

440
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:05,520
Do you know what this department does?

441
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,680
Given your resume,

442
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,830
I can only allocate

443
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:14,280
basic work to you.

444
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,230
That is to start working as a cleaner.

445
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,190
Cleaner?

446
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,160
What’s wrong?

447
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:20,950
Unsatisfied?

448
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,470
I didn’t mean that.

449
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,190
Cleaning seems menial,

450
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:28,400
but it’s crucial to maintain the image of Senwell

451
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:31,110
as a 5A office building.

452
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:32,590
Don’t undervalue it

453
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:34,560
or slack off on the job.

454
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,640
A good learner

455
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,560
can gain experience

456
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,760
from seemingly irrelevant trifles.

457
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,560
Doing every easy work well

458
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,470
isn’t easy at all.

459
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,880
I understand, Ada.

460
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,680
I’ll work hard.

461
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,430
Alright. Go get changed.

462
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:53,760
Thank you, Ada.

463
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:56,950
Cleaner?

464
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,760
Ye Qianyu,

465
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,950
you can do it!

466
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,450
I’m sorry. So sorry.

467
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:31,100
I’m sorry.

468
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,760
Cleaner 119.

469
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,920
Cleaner 119.

470
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,190
Yes, Ada.

471
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:06,190
Floor 21 was waterless for half an hour.

472
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:08,040
Now, the water supply has been restored.

473
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,280
Go clean all the bathrooms there.

474
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,230
Yes. Got it.

475
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:31,470
Hello, Shengzhe?

476
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,350
Chen wants to know if you had eaten.

477
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:37,000
Yes.

478
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:41,110
She asked what you ate.

479
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:44,880
I ate... A big burger.

480
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,430
Wow, sis,

481
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:48,710
you had a burger!

482
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,070
Was it yellow,

483
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,950
big and delicious?

484
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:54,760
Yeah.

485
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,680
Yellow, big and delicious.

486
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:01,470
Can you bring one back for me tonight?

487
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,470
Qianyu.

488
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,800
Burgers are junk food.

489
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,760
They’re unhealthy

490
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,920
and can make you fat.

491
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,000
Don’t eat too many.

492
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,760
Alright. I know.

493
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,040
What’s worse,

494
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:12,400
if you gain too much weight,

495
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,280
Taichu might lose interest in you.

496
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,800
He’s a rare catch.

497
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,430
You cannot lose him, got it?

498
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:22,160
Mom, I have a job now.

499
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:23,920
Maybe I’ll soon become rich.

500
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,160
Then I don’t need to marry a rich man.

501
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,680
What?

502
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,590
You really think you can make yourself rich?

503
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,000
There’s a wealthy man willing to marry you.

504
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,160
How could you let him go?

505
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:35,230
Don’t feel so good about yourself.

506
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:38,230
Hello? Chen, can you hear me?

507
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:39,950
I’m losing you.

508
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:41,590
Hello? Hello?

509
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,350
This is Senwell.

510
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,190
How come the signal is so bad?

511
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:45,190
Hello? Hello? Hello?

512
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:47,040
Gosh!

513
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,880
That girl really pissed me off!

514
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:56,020
= General Manager’s Office =

515
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:58,190
Only GM’s office

516
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:58,880
is left to be cleaned.

517
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,920
After that, I can get off work.

518
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,350
Shan Junhao

519
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:09,070
should’ve left at this hour.

520
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,040
Come in.

521
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:34,830
Mr. Shan.

522
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,760
I’m here to clean your office.

523
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,830
He’s frowning again

524
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:54,880
like an old man.

525
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,110
Mr. Shan,

526
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,430
will it disturb you

527
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:14,590
if I turn on the vacuum cleaner?

528
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:15,310
Hmm.

529
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,430
What does that mean?

530
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,110
So yes or no?

531
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:23,190
I'll just forget this.

532
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:25,830
What’s wrong?

533
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:27,430
Nothing.

534
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:29,520
I accidentally turned on the shower.

535
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,400
Ye Qianyu?

536
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,640
What are you doing here

537
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,710
in this uniform?

538
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,430
I’m an intern in the Administration Department.

539
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,160
Taichu arranged it?

540
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,350
No.

541
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,800
I want to improve myself

542
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,350
to not hold Taichu back.

543
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,710
Put this on.

544
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,590
Thank you, Mr. Shan.

545
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:28,640
Clean it up and leave.

546
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,040
Don’t disturb me.

547
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:44,310
As Taichu’s assistant,

548
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,680
do you always call him by the name?

549
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:48,590
Oh.

550
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:50,000
No,

551
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,280
it’s Mr. Tai.

552
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:53,110
I said it wrong.

553
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:00,350
Shan Junhao,

554
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,950
can you be less serious?

555
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,880
Don’t always frown.

556
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,710
When you do that, people get scared

557
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:12,190
and run away from you.

558
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,380
Cheer up, OK?

559
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:49,920
Come in.

560
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:52,830
Junhao.

561
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,160
Yunyi.

562
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:57,880
Let’s go home.

563
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,950
Mom asked Mrs. Lin to cook the meal.

564
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,110
She’s waiting for us.

565
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,800
You can go home first.

566
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,830
I still have work to do.

567
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,000
I’ll leave after it’s done.

568
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:12,190
I’ll wait for you.

569
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,350
Yunyi.

570
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:49,310
Don’t wait for me.

571
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:51,190
It’s going to take a while.

572
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:53,950
It’s OK. I want to keep you company.

573
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:01,150
Forget it.

574
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,590
Let’s go back.

575
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:09,070
This is the first time

576
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:10,830
you’ve put family before work.

577
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:11,960
Really?

578
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:17,520
Let’s go.

579
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,280
Oh, my goodness!

580
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,160
This kind of cold tone

581
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,680
really matches him.

582
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:57,110
You good-for-nothing!

583
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:59,070
Pack up and leave.

584
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,880
No, no, no.

585
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:08,830
I can’t believe Senwell hired

586
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:10,430
such an irresponsible person.

587
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,920
You’re fired.

588
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,800
Sounds exactly like him.

589
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,070
Qianyu.

590
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,280
Taichu.

591
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,830
Why are you here?

592
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:49,160
To pick you up.

593
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,430
Pick me up?

594
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,400
Are you hungry?

595
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,080
Yeah!

596
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,610
I haven’t had anything for a day.

597
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:58,350
Really?

598
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,760
Not exactly.

599
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,110
Come on. I’ll treat you to a big meal.

600
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:06,110
What’s wrong with your foot?

601
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:06,710
Nothing.

602
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:29,760
Are you OK?

603
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:32,840
I’m fine.

604
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,280
What are we going to eat?

605
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,000
You’ll find out later.

606
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,470
This crab stick is so good.

607
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,390
Taste it.

608
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,040
Have a try.

609
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:09,600
Eat it.

610
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,000
Go ahead or it’ll get cold.

611
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,840
Come on.

612
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,670
So? Isn’t it delicious?

613
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,320
So spicy.

614
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:32,120
You can’t eat spicy food?

615
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,190
We can have a two-flavor hotpot.

616
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:35,840
No need.

617
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,630
I’m fine.

618
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,520
Are you sure?

619
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:41,630
I’ll help myself then.

620
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,230
Eat as much as you can.

621
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:55,870
Qianyu.

622
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,320
Whose shirt is it in your bag?

623
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,800
Shan Junhao’s.

624
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,000
I accidentally wet my blouse

625
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,600
in his office this afternoon,

626
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,120
so he lent it to me.

627
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,870
I’ll dry-clean it before giving it back.

628
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:13,390
Why were you in his office in the first place?

629
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,710
I was there to...

630
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:18,390
Ada told me

631
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:19,520
to do a few things there.

632
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:22,080
Forget it. Not important.

633
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:24,760
How was your first day at work?

634
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,120
Great.

635
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:30,320
Had a busy day.

636
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,150
Good.

637
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,670
Congratulations!

638
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:35,560
To your new start.

639
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:38,280
Thanks.

640
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:43,800
Now that you have a job,

641
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,470
shouldn’t you consider your personal life?

642
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:46,430
What do you mean?

643
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,080
The wish I made to the meteor shower.

644
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:03,120
Taichu,

645
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:07,950
I...

646
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,040
I’m not...

647
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,670
No worries. I can wait.

648
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,230
Because of you,

649
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,040
my wait is fun and joyous.

650
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,390
Let’s eat.

651
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,150
Mr. Shan glanced at me.

652
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:50,560
He’s so cool.

653
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,840
Super hot!

654
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,320
He only seems that way.

655
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:55,630
Don’t you know how bad his temper is?

656
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:57,560
The new guy Taichu is my favorite.

657
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,870
He’s handsome and kind.

658
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:00,040
He isn’t scary at all.

659
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,760
I agree. I like him, too.

660
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,280
You know what, he’s also Dadao.

661
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,600
I’ve been following him on Weibo for years.

662
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,360
I never thought I’d meet him in person.

663
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,800
Gosh!

664
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,230
Ye Qianyu!

665
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:20,470
Mr. Shan is hotter.

666
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,520
Taichu sent another post on Weibo.

667
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:24,080
Ye Qianyu!

668
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,120
Can’t you mop the floor well?

669
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,520
What’s wrong?

670
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,320
I slipped and almost fell in the bathroom.

671
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,520
If someone else fell and got injured,

672
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,360
could you take the responsibility?

673
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:36,080
Sorry, I didn’t do it well.

674
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:37,840
It’s my fault.

675
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,430
Ye Qianyu,

676
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,910
Can’t you even do a simple job like that?

677
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,190
I’m sorry.

678
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,760
I’ll mop it again.

679
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:45,670
This is

680
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:47,840
a 5A office building.

681
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,430
Like the five-star hotel,

682
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:52,720
- everything must be spotless.
- Look, she’s in trouble.

683
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,910
Yes, Ada.

684
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:54,870
By the way,

685
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:56,560
the conference room

686
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,430
is empty now.

687
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:58,630
Someone else will use it later.

688
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:01,190
Go clean the bathroom first.

689
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,320
Yes.

690
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,000
Collect data from all these companies...

691
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:15,600
I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.

692
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,340
It’s OK.

693
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,360
I’m sorry, my bad.

694
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,470
I’m really sorry.

695
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,540
No worries.

696
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,520
Ye Qianyu?

697
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,390
Mr. Zhao.

698
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,560
How come you’re doing the cleaning?

699
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,280
Right now,

700
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,950
I can only do the easiest work well.

701
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,190
But I’ll work hard.

702
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,360
You can do it, Qianyu.

703
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,870
Hey,

704
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:35,120
I’ve put together a list

705
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,150
of all common jargon.

706
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:36,710
Do you still need it?

707
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:37,760
Of course. Thanks.

708
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,430
OK. I’ll send it to you later.

709
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:40,430
Thank you, Mr. Zhao.

710
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:41,390
No big deal.

711
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:42,870
Wait!

712
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:46,200
There’s one more.

713
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,250
Thanks.

714
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:49,210
You’re welcome.

715
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,710
Junhao, look,

716
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,280
this Tuscan castle is amazing.

717
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,280
If we have the wedding there,

718
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:58,280
it’ll be so romantic.

719
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,950
Helena Bay is good, too.

720
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:05,950
What do you think?

721
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:11,080
Or, maybe...

722
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,190
Let’s hold the wedding

723
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:15,360
in Senwell.

724
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,280
It’s more convenient for the guests, too.

725
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:22,670
You have a point.

726
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,000
We’re too busy lately

727
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,870
to spend too much time on this.

728
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:31,950
Mr. Shan.

729
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,800
Here’s the monthly operation analysis

730
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,230
of all the branches and their plan reports.

731
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:37,280
Have a look.

732
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,190
Wedding in a castle.

733
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,670
Good idea.

734
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:51,840
Junhao said

735
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,320
to have the wedding in Senwell

736
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,190
is better.

737
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:57,080
Look at him.

738
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,520
He’s even using his own wedding

739
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,560
for brand promotion.

740
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,910
Given Senwell’s current performance,

741
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,840
no wonder Marv beat us to it.

742
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,280
If we execute quietly

743
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:07,800
according to the plan in the report,

744
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,710
we’ll crush Marv

745
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:09,760
before they notice it.

746
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,870
This is classified information.

747
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:13,840
Make sure it’s kept safe.

748
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,080
I’ll supervise all departments

749
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,430
to execute it.

750
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:20,840
If there’s nothing else,

751
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,080
I’ll go back to work.

752
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:28,390
I’m leaving, too.

753
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:47,910
He must’ve left at this hour.

754
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,760
I... I’m sorry, Mr. Shan.

755
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,760
I didn’t know you’d still be here.

756
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,600
I’ll come back later.

757
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:11,000
Wait.

758
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:26,600
You have 15 minutes only.

759
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,840
Director Fan.

760
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:19,560
Ye Qianyu?

761
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,600
What are you doing here?

762
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,120
I’m here to do the cleaning.

763
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,320
Cleaning?

764
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,000
Ada assigned it to you?

765
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,390
Yes.

766
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:33,120
If Taichu knows

767
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,600
you’re working as a cleaner,

768
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,150
he’ll be annoyed.

769
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:38,000
I’ll rearrange your job.

770
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,910
It’s OK.

771
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:40,430
I’m getting the hang of it

772
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:42,080
and I’ve learned a lot.

773
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:43,600
I’ve never intended to tell Taichu.

774
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:53,280
Where’s Mr. Shan?

775
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:54,600
I don’t know.

776
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,000
He only gave me 15 minutes to clean the room.

777
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,950
Why is his shirt here?

778
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:02,360
I brought it back to him.

779
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:05,600
Brought it back?

780
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:07,710
Well,

781
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,950
when I cleaned his office yesterday,

782
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:11,150
my blouse got wet by accident,

783
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:13,470
so he lent it to me.

784
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,280
It’s OK.

785
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,910
Junhao is always generous to his staff.

786
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:21,670
You don’t need to give it back

787
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:23,320
because he never wears clothes

788
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,710
