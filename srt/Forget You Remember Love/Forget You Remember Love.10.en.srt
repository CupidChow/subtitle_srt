Fengqiao.

Tie this part tight.

13
00:01:44,559 --> 00:01:44,800
OK.

14
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,800
Don’t let it fall.

15

- OK. - OK. Boss. Rest assured.

16
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,480
Sheng. Master.

17
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,304
- Be careful. - OK. OK.

18
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:57,559
Right. That’s it.

19
00:01:57,559 --> 00:01:58,199
OK.

20
00:02:01,839 --> 00:02:02,559
Hello.

21
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,720
Taichu. The photos you shoot are so beautiful.

22
00:02:06,199 --> 00:02:07,639
Can I be your model?

23
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,279
I don’t shoot models.

24
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,559
What about me?

25
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,839
I don’t shoot pets.

26
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,000
You mean I’m your kitten?

27
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,559
Qianyu.

28
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,919
Do you mind my past?

29
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:34,000
I don’t know about your past.

30
00:02:34,399 --> 00:02:35,440
How could I mind it?

31
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,960
Why did you ask me this suddenly?

32
00:02:43,279 --> 00:02:44,000
Nothing.

33
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,279
You are kind of strange today.

34
00:02:58,839 --> 00:02:59,639
Gosh!

35
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:01,399
Good news! Good news!

36
00:03:01,559 --> 00:03:03,039
Great news!

37
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,160
What?

38
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,679
Dadao replied my Weibo.

39
00:03:05,679 --> 00:03:08,119
He said he’d participate in
Guanmei photography show.

40
00:03:10,839 --> 00:03:12,199
Really? Will he come?

41
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:13,119
He is my idol.

42
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,559
I’ve been following him for long.

43
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,800
If Dadao can come,

44
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,600
our photography show

45
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:19,279
will be a great success.

46
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,000
Yes. Yes.

47
00:03:20,559 --> 00:03:21,800
He is an authority.

48
00:03:22,279 --> 00:03:23,119
Why will he come here?

49
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,600
Maybe the old photos I posted

50
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,160
drew his attention.

51
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:27,440
Qianyu.

52
00:03:27,898 --> 00:03:30,520
Another handsome dude will come?

53
00:03:31,279 --> 00:03:31,880
Fengqiao.

54
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,559
Can you be a little reserved?

55
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,639
Let’s get prepared.

56
00:03:35,839 --> 00:03:36,960
Come on. Let’s do it. Hurry up.

57
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,440
Yes.

58
00:03:37,559 --> 00:03:38,199
Hurry up.

59
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:40,080
- OK. - OK.

60
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,039
Taichu.

61
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,160
From your reaction,

62
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:51,960
you seem to know he’ll come.

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,600
Yes.

64
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,759
Do you know him?

65
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,720
You are a traveler like him.

66
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:02,520
I’m not familiar with him.

67
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,720
Qianyu. Come and give me a hand.

68
00:04:09,839 --> 00:04:10,279
Coming.

69
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,520
I can’t buckle it.

70
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,239
Qianyu. Can you be my model?

71
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,200
Ask Fengqiao.

72
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:26,399
Guanmei Inn

73
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,040
has a history of more than 100 years.

74
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:29,640
It was built

75
00:04:29,679 --> 00:04:32,000
by my grandfather brick by brick.

76
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,279
After several renovations,

77
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,640
it becomes like this.

78
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,519
Come. Look at these photos.

79
00:04:40,679 --> 00:04:41,279
What’s this?

80
00:04:41,559 --> 00:04:42,679
It’s parchment

81
00:04:43,239 --> 00:04:45,480
found in waters around Guanmei Fishing Village.

82
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,359
And this is

83
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,200
Chinese white dolphin,

84
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,920
first class national endangered species,

85
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:51,600
known as the aquatic giant panda.

86
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,079
We found a group of them

87
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,640
some time ago.

88
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:56,160
This is the sunset at Guanmei.

89
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:57,440
It’s very special.

90
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,320
When there is fog, it will be dreamier.

91
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,720
Who is the photographer of these photos?

92
00:05:03,799 --> 00:05:06,279
The style seems...

93
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,679
Photographer is right standing in front of you.

94
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,079
Except the repaired old photos,

95
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,760
all other photos at the show

96
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:12,679
were taken by him.

97
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,920
His name is Taichu, a traveler.

98
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,799
I have to say that

99
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,399
today’s photography show is a great success.

100
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:34,839
Su Liyin.

101
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,279
We have so many guests today.

102
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:37,519
Shouldn’t you stay at the front desk?

103
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:38,440
Why do you come here?

104
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,799
I come to see my idol Dadao.

105
00:05:43,559 --> 00:05:44,160
Right.

106
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,200
He said he would come.

107
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,760
Will he come?

108
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,720
I don’t know.

109
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,239
Maybe he’s coming.

110
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,839
Everyone worked hard today.

111
00:06:11,359 --> 00:06:12,040
You know.

112
00:06:12,359 --> 00:06:14,119
We made so many photos

113
00:06:14,359 --> 00:06:15,320
and spent a lot of money,

114
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,160
but our customers in the hotel

115
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,320
didn’t increase much.

116
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,920
This photography show

117
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,160
is such a failure, isn’t it?

118
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,760
Right.

119
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:25,000
Don’t worry, Fengqiao.

120
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,920
Today, most of the people

121
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,320
came for the photography show.

122
00:06:28,559 --> 00:06:30,079
They didn’t mean to check in.

123
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,559
And we successfully aroused their interest

124
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,959
in Guanmei Fishing Village and Guanmei Inn.

125
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,119
It’s good enough that we can achieve this.

126
00:06:39,679 --> 00:06:41,440
It’s a pity that

127
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,640
Dadao didn’t come.

128
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,200
If he can see our sincerity

129
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,399
and recommend Guanmei Inn to others,

130
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,559
that will be great.

131
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:50,839
Qianyu.

132
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:52,799
Although today’s guests

133
00:06:53,119 --> 00:06:54,079
were not influential,

134
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:56,959
it was still helpful to promote

135
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,279
Guanmei Inn.

136
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:00,040
My gosh!

137
00:07:00,359 --> 00:07:02,440
Dadao did come to our Guanmei Inn!

138
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,640
Su Liyin.

139
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,320
Are you insane for him?

140
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:08,839
Look. This is Dadao’s Weibo posted today.

141
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,440
The photos were about our show.

142
00:07:13,799 --> 00:07:15,959
This place will make you linger on,

143
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,160
and you will try to protect it.

144
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,040
Gosh!

145
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,799
Do I see it wrong?

146
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,600
No, you don’t.

147
00:07:23,679 --> 00:07:25,399
This is Dadao’s Weibo.

148
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,079
Dadao did come to our Guanmei Inn!

149
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:30,160
Many people commented they love Guanmei Inn.

150
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,040
Let me have a look.

151
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,720
OK.

152
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,799
What a pity. I missed Dadao.

153
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,920
I wonder if he saw me.

154
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,519
Dadao is quite mysterious.

155
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,359
I get to know

156
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,640
why Dadao never shows up.

157
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:52,640
Why?

158
00:07:53,359 --> 00:07:55,440
He must be too ugly

159
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,440
to meet people.

160
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,160
You have a point.

161
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,679
You have a point.

162
00:08:05,799 --> 00:08:06,440
You have a point.

163
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:07,920
You have a point.

164
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:13,640
Ziqian.

165
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:18,040
You live alone. Don’t you feel lonely?

166
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,359
No.

167
00:08:21,559 --> 00:08:23,000
Daisy keeps me company.

168
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,200
Whenever I come back

169
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:27,519
and see it waiting for me at home,

170
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,679
I feel warm.

171
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:32,559
I know.

172
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,640
You move out early

173
00:08:35,119 --> 00:08:37,280
because you don’t want to rely on others.

174
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,919
I just want to have some space of my own.

175
00:08:48,719 --> 00:08:49,239
Moreover,

176
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:50,799
I can still

177
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,200
take good care of you.

178
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,320
Lately,

179
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:02,039
both the company and home are in a mess.

180
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:05,359
You have to deal with all the things alone.

181
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:06,799
It is tiring, right?

182
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,559
It’s fine.

183
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:15,200
Do you know

184
00:09:16,359 --> 00:09:18,280
why I tell Zhang Minghan

185
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,919
Junhao’s thing?

186
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:23,159
Why?

187
00:09:28,599 --> 00:09:29,799
Because I start to

188
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,239
accept it gradually.

189
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,479
Time is like the one-way road.

190
00:09:40,119 --> 00:09:41,799
We have to move forward.

191
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:47,159
But what

192
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,400
will be there ahead?

193
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:53,840
Hope.

194
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,679
Crap. Crap. Crap.

195
00:10:08,239 --> 00:10:10,440
How come so many people reserve rooms suddenly?

196
00:10:12,719 --> 00:10:13,400
Let me see.

197
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:20,200
Hello? Guanmei Inn.

198
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,960
How many rooms would you need?

199
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,479
OK. I will make a reservation for you right now.

200
00:10:29,359 --> 00:10:31,200
Hello? Guanmei Inn.

201
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,799
How many rooms would you need?

202
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:54,960
Hello. Welcome.

203
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,080
Hello. Hello.

204
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:56,799
Is it your first time here?

205
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:57,359
Yes.

206
00:10:57,359 --> 00:10:59,133
- This way, please. - Please.

207
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,280
This way, please.

208
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,400
Hello. Welcome.

209
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,840
What kind of room would you prefer?

210
00:11:03,239 --> 00:11:03,559
Standard room.

211
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:04,280
Wait a moment.

212
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,640
Is it your first time here?

213
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,520
Yes.

214
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,840
I’m sure you will have a good time here.

215
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,039
Room 204. Please.

216
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:10,840
- Turn right ahead. - Thanks.

217
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,119
Let’s go.

218
00:11:11,119 --> 00:11:12,239
Fengqiao. Show him the way.

219
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:13,520
This way. Let me guide you.

220
00:11:13,599 --> 00:11:14,760
Excuse me. Take your time.

221
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,479
Thanks.

222
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,080
Excuse me. Your dishes.

223
00:11:19,119 --> 00:11:19,880
Would you like anything else?

224
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,679
How about some drinks?

225
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,640
- Three cups. - Three cups, right?

226
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,719
OK.

227
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,520
Hello. Let me help you.

228
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:25,359
Good day.

229
00:11:25,359 --> 00:11:26,039
Come here.

230
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:27,356
- OK. - Welcome.

231
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:39,119
This is great. This is great.

232
00:11:39,359 --> 00:11:40,479
The only drawback is that

233
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,080
we should know this place earlier.

234
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,119
Congratulations. Guanmei Inn

235
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,640
received 122 customers today.

236
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,080
A new record!

237
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:57,239
And the occupancy rate

238
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,039
is up to 98%!

239
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,520
Customers praised the receptionist is beautiful.

240
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,840
Today I received a tip

241
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:05,479
from the first foreign customer.

242
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,400
I am so happy.

243
00:12:07,479 --> 00:12:09,400
I made over 100 coconut cakes today.

244
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,479
They were all eaten up.

245
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:11,679
They said the cakes were tasty.

246
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:17,679
Thanks.

247
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,880
Well done, everyone.

248
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,960
For the first glass of wine,

249
00:12:22,719 --> 00:12:23,840
I propose a toast to you all.

250
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,359
Come on.

251
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:29,513
- Cheers! - Cheers!

252
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,840
Next, I want to say that

253
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,755
Guanmei Inn is a legacy

254
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,200
of three generations of Tang family.

255
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,328
Sadly,

256
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,440
it declines in my hand.

257
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,076
Fortunately, I have Tonghao.

258
00:12:48,359 --> 00:12:50,048
Tonghao gets Guanmei changed

259
00:12:50,239 --> 00:12:54,137
and makes it full of vitality.

260
00:12:55,239 --> 00:12:56,128
For the second glass of wine,

261
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,532
I propose a toast to Tonghao.

262
00:13:00,359 --> 00:13:01,280
Thank you, boss.

263
00:13:03,243 --> 00:13:05,559
Come. Tonghao. One more glass.

264
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:07,872
- One more glass. - One more glass.

265
00:13:07,872 --> 00:13:10,976
- Fill up the glass. - Fill up.

266
00:13:15,119 --> 00:13:16,320
In that case,

267
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,320
I may say something.

268
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,159
Guanmei Inn gets changed

269
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:23,719
because of our joint efforts.

270
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,799
And

271
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,840
I’d like to thank you all.

272
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,320
It is you who give me a new start.

273
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:32,960
Come on.

274
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,679
I propose a toast to you with this glass of wine.

275
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,799
Come.

276
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:39,159
- Cheers! - Cheers!

277
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,400
OK. Let’s start it.

278
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,080
Help yourselves.

279
00:13:50,119 --> 00:13:51,039
- Eat. - Eat.

280
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,400
Hold on. Hold on.

281
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,280
We need to thank another guy.

282
00:13:55,479 --> 00:13:56,760
- Who is it? - Who is it?

283
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,799
It is Dadao.

284
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,039
We have so many customers today

285
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:07,840
all because of his recommendation.

286
00:14:08,239 --> 00:14:08,640
Come.

287
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,039
Let’s toast

288
00:14:10,119 --> 00:14:10,520
to this

289
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,280
mysterious and modest traveler.

290
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,057
Cheers!

291
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,200
To Dadao!

292
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,640
OK. Let’s start.

293
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,400
OK.

294
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,400
Taichu.

295
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,359
Help yourselves.

296
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,119
Thank you, Mama Jinzhi.

297
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,440
You’re welcome.

298
00:14:33,599 --> 00:14:34,760
Tonghao. Eat up.

299
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:36,679
Eat.

300
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,080
This is good.

301
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:39,799
Eat up.

302
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:40,840
Qianyu.

303
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,119
Excuse me.

304
00:14:48,359 --> 00:14:49,200
It’s tasty.

305
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,239
Where are you going?

306
00:14:50,719 --> 00:14:51,640
Tonghao.

307
00:14:55,359 --> 00:14:57,159
I have something to ask you.

308
00:14:58,239 --> 00:14:59,200
Tonghao.

309
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,400
Tell me.

310
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,239
What do you think of me?

311
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,159
Good.

312
00:15:06,479 --> 00:15:07,280
Really?

313
00:15:10,119 --> 00:15:11,159
Coming.

314
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:12,520
Cake is coming.

315
00:15:15,719 --> 00:15:17,080
Whose birthday is it?

316
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,479
It’s Tonghao’s birthday.

317
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:21,719
This cake

318
00:15:21,719 --> 00:15:23,960
is made specially for Tonghao by Master.

319
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,520
I didn’t participate.

320
00:15:25,599 --> 00:15:26,760
It isn’t nasty food cooked by me.

321
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:28,400
Don’t worry.

322
00:15:30,616 --> 00:15:31,697
OK. OK.

323
00:15:36,359 --> 00:15:37,039
Happy birthday.

324
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:37,440
Please.

325
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,359
Go ahead.

326
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,840
Is it my birthday today?

327
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:45,000
Yes, it is.

328
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,919
This date will be Tonghao’s birthday

329
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:49,640
in the future every year.

330
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,285
- Bravo! - Bravo!

331
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,559
Thank you all.

Thank you, Qianyu.

333
00:16:08,359 --> 00:16:10,159
Let’s sing “Happy Birthday” to Tonghao.

334
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:11,359
OK.

335
00:16:11,359 --> 00:16:11,760

Make a wish.

Alright. Alright.

352

Stop drinking.

353
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,079
Let’s go.

354
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:38,760
- Go. - I’m not drunk.

355
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,358
Go.

356
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:43,119
Don’t drink so much again.

357
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,199
We’re leaving.

358
00:18:47,199 --> 00:18:48,479
- Shengzhe. - Tonghao.

359
00:18:48,479 --> 00:18:49,239
Another drink.

00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,439
Let’s go.

361
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,000
Go back to sleep.

362
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:53,599
You drank too much.

363
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:54,680
Let’s go, Shengzhe.

364
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,920
Slowly.

365
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:15,479
What’s wrong, Qianyu?

366
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,439
How come photos on Dadao’s Weibo

367
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,119
are in Taichu’s camera?

368
00:19:29,959 --> 00:19:32,199
Could it be that he is Dadao?

369
00:19:33,479 --> 00:19:34,520
How is it possible?

370
00:19:36,959 --> 00:19:37,560
Taichu.

371
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:41,800
This is a picture in your camera.

372
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:44,079
This is the picture on Dadao’s Weibo.

373
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,599
You found it out.

374
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:03,920
Actually, I’m the ugly Dadao.

375
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,359
What?

376
00:20:08,239 --> 00:20:09,800
Dachu is Taidao?

377
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,119
What?

378
00:20:11,719 --> 00:20:13,280
Taidao is Dachu?

379
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,239
Why didn’t you tell us earlier?

380
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,160
Why did you hide your identity

381
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,760
and help us?

382
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:32,160
I didn’t mean to hide my identity.

383
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:35,239
And Dadao has told you

384
00:20:35,239 --> 00:20:36,680
why I helped Guanmei Inn.

385
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,640
This place will make you linger on,

386
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,439
and you will try to protect it.

387
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,520
Come on.

388
00:20:57,359 --> 00:20:58,479
I propose a toast to you.

389
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:00,839
Thank you for helping us so much.

390
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,119
Thanks, Taichu. I propose a toast to you as well.

391
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:04,920
You’re welcome.

392
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,680
Excuse me.

393
00:21:15,719 --> 00:21:17,000
I’m going to answer the phone.

394
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,868
Would you like to take a walk there?

395
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:31,880
Let’s go.

396
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:39,719
Go back to sleep.

397
00:21:42,199 --> 00:21:44,319
Dachu is Taidao.

398
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:45,800
Taidao is Dachu.

399
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,599
Qianyu.

400
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:11,239
Thank you.

401
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,920
For what?

402
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,839
Thank you for

403
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:28,119
celebrating’ the first birthday in my memory.

404
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:31,920
You’re welcome.

405
00:22:32,199 --> 00:22:34,359
I will be there for every birthday of yours.

406
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:49,880
People are flying Kongming Lanterns.

407
00:22:50,719 --> 00:22:51,839
Let’s go and have a look.

408
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:05,239
So many Kongming Lanterns!

409
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:08,680
So beautiful!

410
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:16,640
I am really happy today.

411
00:23:17,239 --> 00:23:19,359
Thanks to Taichu’s help,

412
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:22,119
so many customers came.

413
00:23:22,959 --> 00:23:25,000
And I never thought

414
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:27,560
Taichu is Dadao.

415
00:23:55,239 --> 00:23:56,680
Ye Qianyu.

416
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,920
I work hard for Guanmei Inn as well.

417
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,319
Why don’t you thank me?

418
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:03,760
You are different.

419
00:24:04,199 --> 00:24:05,319
How so?

420
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,560
He is a guest.

421
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,400
You are not.

422
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:18,599
What am I then?

423
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,199
You are one of us.

424
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:41,119
But

425
00:24:42,719 --> 00:24:44,800
I have no idea how long you will stay in Guanmei.

426
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,040
Qianyu.

427
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,359
I know what you’re worried about.

428
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,719
Even so,

429
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,040
I still can’t help caring about you.

430
00:25:23,479 --> 00:25:24,400
Tonghao.

431
00:25:25,719 --> 00:25:27,000
Sometimes,

432
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,000
I feel your arrival

433
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,119
is like an unreal dream.

434
00:25:33,239 --> 00:25:36,000
I don’t know when I will wake up from the dream.

435
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,079
Maybe after I wake up,

436
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,560
I can’t see you anymore.

437
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,800
Qianyu.

438
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:53,439
All my memory

439
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:55,239
is about Guanmei and you.

440
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,160
Even if my memory will recover one day,

441
00:25:58,439 --> 00:26:00,239
I will not leave here,

442
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,040
or leave you.

443
00:26:05,479 --> 00:26:06,520
Are you sure?

444
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,160
Pinkie promise.

445
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,560
Help yourselves.

446
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,599
Thanks.

447
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:50,959
Mr. Taichu.

448
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:53,959
You supported Guanmei Inn on Weibo

449
00:26:54,439 --> 00:26:55,560
and promoted Guanmei Fishing Village.

450
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:57,800
It isn’t fair from the company’s perspective.

451
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,760
I’ve finished the report.

452
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:02,400
All the feasibility analysis

453
00:27:02,439 --> 00:27:03,760
is objective and fair.

454
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,000
Weibo is personal.

455
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:08,680
It shows my favor to Guanmei Fishing Village.

456
00:27:10,439 --> 00:27:13,000
Mr. Wang hasn’t made instructions on your report.

457
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,560
Senwell hasn’t finished

458
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,920
the revision of the development
project of Guanmei.

459
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:18,680
You showed your attitude in public

460
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:19,920
before it’s determined.

461
00:27:20,479 --> 00:27:22,079
It will make Senwell and GQ Ventures

462
00:27:22,199 --> 00:27:23,079
in a passive role.

463
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:28,880
My investigation result on Guanmei Fishing Village

464
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,280
and my comments on Weibo

465
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,479
are consistent.

466
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,400
The decisions of Senwell

467
00:27:33,479 --> 00:27:34,760
and GQ Ventures

468
00:27:34,959 --> 00:27:37,000
are not my considerations.

469
00:27:39,479 --> 00:27:41,479
You ask me to do the investigation

470
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,119
because you believe my judgment, right?

471
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,400
I’m sure

472
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,239
you will see the final decision very soon.

473
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,400
You know.

474
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,760
What you say and do matters a lot.

475
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,880
So we’re kind of worried.

476
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,839
I believe my judgment.

477
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,400
Mr. Wang will return from abroad soon.

478
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,119
He wants to talk with you face to face.

479
00:28:04,479 --> 00:28:05,319
When?

480
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,359
These two days.

481
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:08,839
I’ll tell you the specific time later.

482
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,560
OK. No problem.

483
00:28:15,719 --> 00:28:17,400
Dadao updated a Weibo

484
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,280
about Guanmei Fishing Village.

485
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,040
This is the first time Dadao shows his attitude

486
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,439
to Guanmei Fishing Village.

487
00:28:24,199 --> 00:28:26,079
From the text we can see

488
00:28:26,239 --> 00:28:27,319
Dadao

489
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:29,280
is on Guanmei Fishing Village’s side.

490
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:31,560
I’ve been trying to get in touch with him,

491
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:33,560
but no result.

492
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:36,079
It doesn’t matter now.

493
00:28:36,479 --> 00:28:37,560
His feasibility report

494
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,800
has been submitted to GQ Ventures.

495
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:41,520
That’s why Mr. Wang wants to
meet with Shan Junhao.

496
00:28:42,199 --> 00:28:43,719
Because of Shan Junhao’s disappearance,

497
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,160
the discovery of Chinese white dolphins,

498
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,319
and Dadao’s attitude,

499
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:50,079
GQ Ventures already has doubts

500
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,719
on our project.

501
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:54,599
The priority now

502
00:28:55,199 --> 00:28:56,319
is to finish the revision

503
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,560
of Guanmei development project soon

504
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,920
and make plans for GQ’s worries.

505
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,040
But we can’t find Shan Junhao now.

506
00:29:03,479 --> 00:29:04,439
Mr. Zhang.

507
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,760
If you can’t do

508
00:29:06,959 --> 00:29:08,719
what Mr. Shan can,

509
00:29:09,239 --> 00:29:10,000
you don’t deserve

510
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:11,760
the position of general manager.

511
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,479
Well.

512
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,760
I’ll go with Mr. Zhang

513
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,000
to meet with Mr. Wang.

514
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:19,760
No.

515
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,199
I can handle it myself.

516
00:29:29,439 --> 00:29:30,439
Taichu.

517
00:29:30,479 --> 00:29:31,560
Taichu. You are back.

518
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,479
Taichu.

519
00:29:32,719 --> 00:29:33,959
Do you have clothes to wash?

520
00:29:33,959 --> 00:29:36,640
Let me wash your clothes.

521
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,599
Taichu.

522
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:38,239
Come. Let’s take photos together.

523
00:29:38,239 --> 00:29:39,079
Where did you do the hairstyle?

524
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:40,719
Can I have the same hairstyle?

525
00:29:40,719 --> 00:29:41,880
Taichu.

526
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,880
- Could I have your autograph?
- This photo will be the profile picture

527
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,880
of all my social softwares.

528
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,079
Your hairstyle is wonderful.

529
00:29:47,199 --> 00:29:48,800
I want your autograph, too.

530
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,239
Someone ordered takeout. Two boxes of ice cream.

531
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:04,119
Deliver them right now.

532
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,640
Ye Qianyu.

533
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:15,040
Who will have your nasty food

534
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,719
this time?

535
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,280
Not you anyway.

536
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,280
You think I don’t know whom it is for?

537
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,680
I’m leaving.

538
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,560
Taichu.

539
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,160
Why are you here?

540
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,359
You don’t know.

541
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,400
They see me like an alien

542
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,119
whenever I show up at Guanmei Inn.

543
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,520
So I have to sneak out.

544
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:06,119
Where are my ice creams?

545
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,560
Your takeout?

546
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,319
Yes.

547
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,560
Qianyu.

548
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,640
I have a question for you.

549
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,359
What is it?

550
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,520
Is Tonghao really your cousin?

551
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,119
Actually

552
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,079
not.

553
00:31:46,239 --> 00:31:49,239
My car bumped into him one night.

554
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,359
He didn’t remember anything when he woke up.

555
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,520
Mama Jinzhi and I didn’t know what to do,

556
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:57,040
so we took him home.

557
00:31:58,319 --> 00:31:59,239
Your car bumped into him?

558
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,479
It was dark.

559
00:32:02,199 --> 00:32:03,640
He was wet all over

560
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,199
and came from nowhere.

561
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:06,319
He had fallen down

562
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:07,400
before I braked.

563
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,319
I didn’t mean it.

564
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:15,000
You think I’m a bad guy, right?

565
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,239
Do you care about my opinions to you?

566
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:22,719
Of course.

567
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,920
You are my friend.

568
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,359
I’m happy to hear that.

569
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,160
Thanks for your ice cream.

570
00:32:41,239 --> 00:32:42,680
I have work to do. I’m leaving.

571
00:32:43,959 --> 00:32:45,680
OK. Go ahead.

572
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,599
Bye.

573
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:57,719
What’s wrong?

574
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,479
My old car breaks down again.

575
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:07,520
Drive my car then.

576
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,359
Is it OK?

577
00:33:10,719 --> 00:33:11,760
Why not?

578
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,040
I don’t need it now.

579
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:15,280
You can’t deliver goods on foot, can you?

580
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,439
This place is quite ordinary,

581
00:33:24,439 --> 00:33:25,760
much worse than Senwell Hotel

582
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:26,800
where we usually stay.

583
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:28,160
Right.

584
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,079
Ye Qianyu.

585
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:36,880
Dai Anfen.

586
00:33:40,199 --> 00:33:41,400
It’s you!

587
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:43,719
I thought I made a mistake.

588
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:45,560
Do you still live in Guanmei?

589
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,199
Yes. So what?

590
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:51,359
I remember

591
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,880
you didn’t find a job after graduation

592
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,079
so you went home.

593
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,520
We haven’t contacted since then.

594
00:33:59,439 --> 00:34:00,359
Look.

595
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,160
Your style of dressing

596
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,680
is exactly the same

597
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,920
as before.

598
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,399
What do you do now?

599
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,840
Nothing special.

600
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,520
I help my mom in the store.

601
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,760
Do you still run that grocery store?

602
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,159
Your car is good.

603
00:34:18,479 --> 00:34:19,639
How can you

604
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:20,959
afford this car by running a grocery store?

605
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,479
Can’t I buy such a car

606
00:34:23,479 --> 00:34:25,120
by running a grocery store?

607
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,120
Are you still together?

608
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:29,679
Why do you come to Guanmei?

609
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,719
Dadao’s Weibo said

610
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:36,320
Guanmei Inn was good.

611
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,840
So Mike insisted on

612
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,879
coming here with me to have a look.

613
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:43,439
I just looked around.

614
00:34:43,959 --> 00:34:44,760
It’s quite ordinary,

615
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,840
much worse than Senwell Hotel

616
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:48,239
where we usually stay.

617
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,080
By the way, Qianyu,

618
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,360
do you have a boyfriend?

619
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,080
Yes. What do you mean?

620
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,919
I remember you said

621
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:04,360
you would find a rich boyfriend.

622
00:35:04,919 --> 00:35:07,000
How is your boyfriend?

623
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:10,760
My boyfriend is very kind to me.

624
00:35:11,479 --> 00:35:14,399
He shares my work when I’m busy,

625
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:15,719
and helps me protect Guanmei.

626
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,080
He’s the hero of this island.

627
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,719
You see this car?

628
00:35:22,919 --> 00:35:24,120
It’s my boyfriend’s car.

629
00:35:24,199 --> 00:35:25,199
Gorgeous, right?

630
00:35:25,399 --> 00:35:29,439
My boyfriend is more gorgeous than this car.

631
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,439
That is to say,

632
00:35:31,439 --> 00:35:33,239
your boyfriend must be very rich.

633
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,639
He is.

634
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,760
He gives me many keys,

635
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
the keys of villas and cars.

636
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,159
I can’t even tell one from another.

637
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,439
We’re looking forward to meeting him,

638
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:46,280
right?

639
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:46,679
Yes.

640
00:35:46,879 --> 00:35:48,280
We’ll have a party in two days.

641
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:49,840
Come with your boyfriend.

642
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:51,719
Yes.

643
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:55,399
I can’t. I am busy.

644
00:35:55,919 --> 00:35:56,919
You must come.

645
00:35:56,919 --> 00:35:58,159
It is rare to meet.

646
00:35:58,199 --> 00:36:00,000
We were classmates. You must come to the party.

647
00:36:00,479 --> 00:36:02,600
I believe our classmates are curious about

648
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,280
that Clumsy...

649
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,800
Clumsy Dance Queen

650
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:10,159
- Clumsy.
- has what kind of boyfriend now.

651
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,040
Mike.

652
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,840
We will be late, right?

653
00:36:13,919 --> 00:36:14,639
Yes.

654
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,239
I have no time to talk with you.

655
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:19,159
We have business to do. We gotta go.

656
00:36:19,399 --> 00:36:20,959
I’ll send you the address later.

657
00:36:20,959 --> 00:36:22,439
Be sure to come.

658
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:23,560
Bye.

659
00:36:24,439 --> 00:36:26,600
Her boyfriend? That’s funny.

660
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,040
Let’s see who she will come with.

661
00:36:28,879 --> 00:36:30,399
I’m sure she won’t come with a boyfriend.

662
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,360
Waiter.

663
00:36:32,399 --> 00:36:33,399
Hello. This is the menu.

664
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:34,919
These are our specialties.

665
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,239
I like this.

666
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,360
Sheng.

667
00:36:42,959 --> 00:36:44,120
Why don’t you

668
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:45,439
clean up this table?

669
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,520
Tonghao. The customer just left.

670
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,399
I didn’t have time to tidy up.

671
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:49,840
Don’t make excuses for your mistakes.

672
00:36:50,479 --> 00:36:51,159
Sorry.

673
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:52,639
Waiter.

674
00:36:54,919 --> 00:36:55,879
Hello. Can I help you?

675
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,679
Tonghao. Are you hungry?

676
00:36:57,679 --> 00:36:59,159
I made lunch for you.

677
00:37:00,399 --> 00:37:02,600
I’m busy. Leave it to yourself.

678
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,439
I’ll have meal for staff.

679
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,560
Eat lunch first.

680
00:37:18,959 --> 00:37:19,959
Su Liyin.

681
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,520
I told you many times.

682
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,040
Don’t do make ups when you are working.

683
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,479
It is very unprofessional.

684
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,080
Yes.

685
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,000
Su Liyin.

686
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,959
Why not spend more time

687
00:37:29,959 --> 00:37:31,719
helping Sheng in the restaurant?

688
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,320
He can’t do it all by himself.

689
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,080
I am a receptionist.

690
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,800
How can I leave my post?

691
00:37:38,439 --> 00:37:40,320
A beautiful image

692
00:37:40,879 --> 00:37:43,080
shows the professionalism of my work.

693
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,679
What do you think

694
00:37:45,879 --> 00:37:47,800
of my new lipstick color?

695
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:51,040
It’s ugly. Wipe it off. You will scare the guests.

696
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,280
I think it’s pretty.

697
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:00,080
It suits you well.

698
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:03,679
Liyin. We may have more guests tonight.

699
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,280
The dinner will be late.

700
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:15,719
You may eat this first.

701
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Thank you.

702
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:28,517
The food is so ugly.

703
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,360
For the sake of your kindness,

704
00:38:30,919 --> 00:38:33,360
I will accept it reluctantly.

705
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:44,199
Ye Qianyu.

706
00:38:44,479 --> 00:38:46,639
Does your cousin fall for me?

707
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,719
He gives me food to chase me.

708
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,239
Not romantic at all.

709
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:01,879
These are all for you.

710
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,399
You usually eat a lot.

711
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,800
You think I’m a pig?

712
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,840
Darn it.

713
00:39:11,584 --> 00:39:14,010
= Money Bag Grocery =

714
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,560
Ye Qianyu.

715
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,399
Do you have a grudge with the calculator?

716
00:39:27,399 --> 00:39:29,080
It costs money to buy it.

717
00:39:32,479 --> 00:39:34,679
In the world,

718
00:39:34,959 --> 00:39:37,080
only one thing can make women furious

719
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:40,159
and let them vent anger

720
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:41,399
by breaking things.

721
00:39:43,439 --> 00:39:44,199
What is it?

722
00:39:44,879 --> 00:39:45,840
Men.

723
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,080
Big sister.

724
00:39:50,919 --> 00:39:52,560
It is heavily raining outside.

725
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:55,320
I suggest you sending an umbrella to Tonghao.

726
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,760
You little imp. What nonsense is that?

727
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:03,040
Her boyfriend will be cabriolet guy.

728
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,000
You know that?

729
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,360
Mama Jinzhi.

730
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:17,520
You are back.

731
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,159
Whose umbrella is this?

732
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:27,280
Su Liyin’s.

733
00:40:36,679 --> 00:40:37,199
Tonghao.

734
00:40:37,239 --> 00:40:38,080
Gently.

735
00:40:38,439 --> 00:40:39,199
I think

736
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:42,239
Su Liyin is a good girl.

737
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:45,479
It seems you two are close.

738
00:40:45,959 --> 00:40:47,520
She suits you well.

739
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,560
Chen.

740
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,959
You’re adding fuel to the fire.

741
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,760
You little kid. Who do you know about?

742
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,040
Tonghao. Is Taichu still in the inn?

743
00:41:03,159 --> 00:41:03,959
Yes.

744
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:05,239
That’s good.

745
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,159
Qianyu will take Taichu to a classmate party

746
00:41:08,679 --> 00:41:10,439
the day after tomorrow.

747
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,800
I’m going upstairs.

748
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,080
Chen.

749
00:41:35,479 --> 00:41:37,360
When did I say I would go to classmate party

750
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,800
with Taichu?

751
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:44,760
Come.

752
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,000
Look.

753
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:48,159
Dai Anfen sent you the address.

754
00:41:48,199 --> 00:41:49,719
I replied for you.

755
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,560
If I don’t go,

756
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,879
she’ll post my awkward dance video

757
00:41:56,919 --> 00:41:57,840
on the Internet.

758
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,919
So you have to go.

759
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,639
It’s a good opportunity

760
00:42:01,639 --> 00:42:03,760
for you to seek revenge against her.

761
00:42:04,479 --> 00:42:06,320
You can count on me.

762
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:08,479
I’ll find cabriolet guy for you.

763
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:09,679
Qianyu.

764
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,239
Remember this.

765
00:42:11,479 --> 00:42:14,199
Stay away from Tonghao.

766
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,840
Or cabriolet guy will mistake it.

767
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,360
You...

768
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:21,600
Hey...

769
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:23,760
What is her attitude?

770
00:42:24,439 --> 00:42:26,199
Shouldn’t she thank me?

771
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,080
Anyway, I will

772
00:42:30,439 --> 00:42:32,320
make an appointment with cabriolet guy tomorrow.

773
00:42:38,992 --> 00:42:40,768
= Guanmei Inn =

774
00:42:41,439 --> 00:42:42,520
Hello, cabriolet guy.

775
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,879
Mama Jinzhi. Morning.

776
00:42:45,439 --> 00:42:46,879
Morning.

777
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,479
The clothes you wear today

778
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:51,959
are as red as

779
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:53,399
your car.

780
00:42:53,639 --> 00:42:54,959
It suits you well.

781
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,120
Really?

782
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,239
What brings you here, Mama Jinzhi?

783
00:43:01,959 --> 00:43:02,800
Well.

will attend a classmate party.

786
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:08,159
She wants you to go with her,

787
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,520
but she is too shy to say it.

788
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,600
You know girls.

789
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:12,760
When?

790
00:43:13,239 --> 00:43:13,879

00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:15,199
Are you free tomorrow?

792
00:43:16,199 --> 00:43:16,919
Tomorrow?

793
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,439
I have a very important meeting tomorrow.

794
00:43:20,679 --> 00:43:22,719
I’m afraid I don’t have time.

795
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:25,800
I see.

796
00:43:27,159 --> 00:43:27,959
Sorry.

797
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Never mind. It’s fine.

798
00:43:31,479 --> 00:43:33,479
I’ll take my leave then.

799
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,080
Good day.

800
00:43:37,024 --> 00:43:38,280
= Guanmei Inn =

801
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,439
Bye. Come to my home when you have time.

802
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:41,719
OK. Bye.

803
00:43:54,399 --> 00:43:55,080
Qianyu.

804
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:00,479
I went to meet cabriolet guy.

805
00:44:00,879 --> 00:44:03,080
He will be too busy to go with you.

806
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,719
What about your classmate party?

807
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,040
Let Tonghao go with you.

808
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:23,040
He isn’t a rich man. How can I go with him?

809
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:26,320
Dai Anfen doesn’t know Taichu,

810
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:27,120
right?

811
00:44:27,479 --> 00:44:30,080
Let Tonghao disguise as Taichu.

812
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,000
Is it OK?

813
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:36,639
Why not?

814
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,120
You’re right.

815
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:39,919
OK.

816
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:43,320
Hey.

817
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,719
Have you repaired your old car?

818
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:46,679
We have tons of goods to deliver.

819
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,861
