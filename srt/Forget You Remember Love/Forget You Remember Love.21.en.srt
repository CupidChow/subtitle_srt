12
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,550
Many on this list are new.

13
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:56,840
Yes.

14
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:59,120
They’re elites I poached

15
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,830
from other companies.

16
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,270
I interviewed them one by one.

17
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,950
Compared with our senior staff,

18
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,910
their average age is five years younger,

19
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,550
salaries are 30% lower,

20
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,390
but they are just as capable.

21
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:11,190
This way,

22
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:14,270
we can reduce labor costs

23
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:17,080
and gain more vitality.

24
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,670
Are there particular reasons

25
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,160
to transfer or fire senior staff members?

26
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,360
I’ve checked them thoroughly.

27
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,550
They hogged

28
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,470
key positions of key departments for long.

29
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,600
Their salaries are high.

30
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,190
They think the company depends on them,

31
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,390
so they despise others

32
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,390
and are irresponsible.

33
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,110
They’re hindering the company from further growth.

34
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,550
You’re a good judge of character.

35
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,880
You were in charge

36
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,320
of recruitment before.

37
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,750
I trust your judgment.

38
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,440
But be sure to handle

39
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,830
the aftermath properly

40
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,320
to avoid future disputes.

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,440
Sure. Consider it done.

42
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,160
Alright.

43
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,910
Tell HR

44
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,240
to announce it soon.

45
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,370
OK.

46
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,500
Dawei,

47
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,800
go to HR tomorrow

48
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,360
to get me the list of new recruits.

49
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,440
Do a full background check on them

50
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,670
and report it to me.

51
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,230
Yes, Mr. Shan.

52
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,450
Everyone, cheer up!

53
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,100

You’re awesome, Taichu!

Welcome.

100
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,230
Don’t overthink.

101
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,640
I’m only here for the meteor shower.

102
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:31,020
It’s our biggest pleasure to have you here.

103
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,240
Welcome!

Thank you.

111

Here’s a gift.

112
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,710
We can do it!

113
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,320
Have you checked the new employees’ backgrounds?

114
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,640
I have.

115
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,160
They’re indeed the best in the industry.

116
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,560
But...

117
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,490
But what?

118
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,480
Giving so many new members

119
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,200
in key positions,

120
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,000
will it break the company’s balance?

121
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,550
Director Xu is reliable.

122
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,550
I don’t think it’ll be a problem.

123
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,230
But

124
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,070
do keep track of staff’s reactions.

125
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,110
I will, Mr. Shan.

126
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,160
Come in.

127
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,190
Junhao.

128
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,110
Hi, Yunyi.

129
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,350
Director Fan.

130
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,670
Is your work done?

131
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,600
We agreed to

132
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,070
try wedding gowns and suits at 2 with Mom.

133
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,510
She’s downstairs already.

134
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:05,640
OK.

135
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,550
Give me a minute.

136
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,830
I’m not done yet.

137
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,050
I booked window seats at Star Restaurant

138
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:11,920
for tonight.

139
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,750
Later on,

140
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,110
we can have dinner

141
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,550
while enjoying the meteor shower.

142
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,320
Meteor shower?

143
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:17,920
Yeah.

144
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,980
There will be a Taurus meteor shower tonight.

145
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,080
You forgot?

146
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,790
You promised

147
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,440
to watch it with me.

148
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:32,070
How could I forget that?

149
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,670
Why don’t you go downstairs

150
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:35,640
to be with Mom first?

151
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,440
I still have something to tell Dawei,

152
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,440
then I’ll meet you there.

153
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,160
OK.

154
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,880
Guanmei Fishing Village

155
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,920
will host its first Tourism and Culture Festival

156
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,440
in a week.

157
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,670
I’m here to invite you.

158
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:53,920
Mr. Shan.

159
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:55,600
Mr. Shan?

160
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,950
What else do you need me to do?

161
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:03,760
Go to Guanmei Fishing Village.

162
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,530
Guanmei?

163
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:06,560
Hmm.

164
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:09,400
Guanmei Inn is hosting

165
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,120
its first Tourism and Culture Festival today.

166
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,830
Go have a look

167
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,510
in case of any trouble.

168
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,160
After all,

169
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:21,720
Senwell owns Guanmei Inn.

170
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,670
OK, I see.

171
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,480
I’m going.

172
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:31,230
Meteor shower?

173
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,440
Zhang Minghan,

174
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,080
inviting yourself in

175
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,320
isn’t a good habit.

176
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,280
I thought you didn’t believe me

177
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,000
but you acted fast.

178
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,620
It seemed that you replaced my people

179
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,260
but they were Shan Junhao’s men.

180
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,000
That’s a normal change of personnel.

181
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,710
Of course it must seem that way.

182
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,520
Otherwise, wouldn’t it be troublesome,

183
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,000
if Shan Junhao noticed it?

184
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,880
Relax.

185
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:17,640
I’m on your side.

186
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,640
Once we join hands,

187
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,150
Shan Junhao will have to step down

188
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,790
from his position as general manager and chairman.

189
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,200
You can get your shares back

190
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,960
and I’ll regain my position as general manager.

191
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,670
Isn’t that win-win?

192
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,150
You’re thinking too much.

193
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,320
Don’t tell me

194
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,880
you don’t want the shares.

195
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,080
Your action has said it all.

196
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,590
I’m here only to tell you

197
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,400
I support what you are doing.

198
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,880
That recording only proves

199
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,960
that Shan Yaolong verbally threatened

200
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,840
your father,

201
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,030
but he didn’t break the law.

202
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,840
Your father signed the contract after all.

203
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,790
As long as we make that recording public,

204
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:07,150
Shan Junhao will have to hand over everything.

205
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,590
Right now, we must be meticulous

206
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:10,760
and take one step at a time

207
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,640
to slowly weaken his power.

208
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,720
There’s no “we”

209
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,200
between you and me.

210
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,520
Ziqian.

211
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,790
Working with me is your best choice.

212
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:28,150
I never take sides.

213
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,320
You’d better

214
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,000
spend more time on yourself.

215
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:33,870
Don’t forget

216
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,350
you’re still suspended.

217
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,320
I told you

218
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,470
I had nothing to do

219
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,350
with Mr. Qiu and Mr. Lin’s attempt

220
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:39,840
to kidnap Shan Junhao.

221
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,590
I’ll be back soon.

222
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,110
You’re gonna need me then.

223
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,320
- Please enjoy. - Enjoy, guys.

224
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,960
- Please enjoy. - Enjoy, everyone.

225
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,780
- What do you need? - OK.

226
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:07,820
- Here.

227
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,840
- Here. - OK.

228
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:10,880
Your towel.

229
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,430
- The wine tastes good. - This is OK.

230
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:15,470
Bring it over there.

231
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:17,590
Over there.

232
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:18,350
That table, right?

233
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:19,910
Here you are, miss.

234
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:22,000
- Enjoy the wine. - Give me a sec.

235
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,590
You look gorgeous, Qianyu!

236
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,790
That wine pairs well with this dish.

237
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,230
Yes.

238
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,400
Enjoy your food and wine.

239
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:35,700
What do you think?

240
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,030
It’s good, huh?

241
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,550
The taste isn’t too bad,

242
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:42,710
but how is it special?

243
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,440
The cod are done.

244
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:45,820
Try this.

245
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,290
If you need anything, feel free to tell me.

246
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,960
Thank you for all your support.

247
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,200
We have all sorts of drinks.

248
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,840
Tell us if you need anything.

249
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,880
- Here. - Taste it while it’s hot.

250
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,200
- Have a bite. - OK, you’re welcome.

251
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,080
Drink as much as you can.

252
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,840
- Enjoy the wine. - Enjoy, guys.

253
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,960
Make yourselves at home.

254
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,080
This is good.

255
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:14,080
The cod are from southern France.

256
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,550
Their heads and guts are removed

257
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,280
and are frozen quickly with their tails hung up.

258
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,470
They’re stored and shipped

259
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:21,840
at -40℃ along the way

260
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,520
to preserve

261
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,960
their freshness and taste to the maximum.

262
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,790
The sauce we use

263
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:29,030
is handmade by our executive chef

264
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,200
following a secret recipe.

265
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,440
Here comes the spring chicken.

266
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,110
Let me.

267
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,280
Taste this dish.

268
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,590
It’s delicious.

269
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,230
This Guanmei Flavored Braised Chicken

270
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,000
is our signature dish.

271
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:51,110
All chickens are handpicked

272
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:53,150
and braised with bree.

273
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,200
That pot of bree

274
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,680
is over 100 years old.

275
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,910
It’s been used since Guanmei Inn was built.

276
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,320
But don’t worry,

277
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,200
it didn’t go bad

278
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,790
but has become more flavorful.

279
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,520
No wonder.

280
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,110
Its taste is unique.

281
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:10,440
Enjoy the meal.

282
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:11,840
We’ll go wait other tables.

283
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,470
- Have some more wine. - Enjoy!

284
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,760
Hi, guys, cheers!

285
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,140
- Enjoy yourselves. - Drink more.

286
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:30,020
Have fun, everyone.

287
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:30,660
How’s the food?

288
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:32,160
Cheers!

289
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:32,720
What do you think?

290
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,420
Do you like the food?

291
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:34,960
It’s good.

292
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,660
- I like it. - Have some water.

293
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,470
Please make more cod.

294
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,200
- Eat whatever you like. - OK.

295
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,570
- Thank you. - This is your wine.

296
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,770
Oh, thank you.

297
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:42,670
Sheng,

298
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,950
serve more food.

299
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,040
How is it? Is it nice?

300
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,300
Got it.

301
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,670
Have fun, guys.

302
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,140
Hello. Hi, my followers.

303
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,150
This is Princess Snow.

304
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:59,590
I’m at the first Tourism and Culture Festival

305
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,520
held by Guanmei Fishing Village.

306
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,670
This is Guanmei Inn.

307
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,590
Tonight,

308
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:07,760
there will be a huge Taurus meteor shower.

309
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,320
Guanmei Inn

310
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,400
is the best viewing place.

311
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,680
Enjoy the wine. Enjoy!

312
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,140
Make yourselves at home.

313
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:27,550
The taste is great.

314
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:29,000
Tell me if you need anything.

315
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:30,760
Give us a shout if you need anything.

316
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,320
Dawei!

317
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,940
- It’s fresh. - Thank you, guys.

318
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,440
What brings you here?

319
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,320
Didn’t Mr. Shan come with you?

320
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,150
He and Miss Fan Yunyi

321
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,710
are going to try wedding gowns and suits,

322
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:44,520
so I’m here

323
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,760
on his behalf to inspect your work.

324
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,150
Dawei, come here.

325
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,670
Have a seat. Sit.

326
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,590
Come here.

327
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,710
Cheers, guys.

328
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,470
Shan Junhao is too busy with his wedding

329
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,080
to come here in person.

330
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:02,670
But it’s OK.

331
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:04,280
I believe Dawei

332
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,400
will tell him our performance.

333
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,790
Here’s your food. Please enjoy.

334
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,470
Go to work.

335
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,470
I’m here as an inspector.

336
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,640
Why are you...

337
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,000
Smells familiar.

338
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,790
Right?

339
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,790
We’re short of one player tonight.

340
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,200
Let me fill my stomach first.

341
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:33,960
OK, OK, OK.

342
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,340
You’ve lost some weight. Eat up.

343
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:35,960
- Juice. - Have some more.

344
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,720
This... This juice.

345
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,900
Fine. I’ll go get it.

346
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,670
Seeing you two like this

347
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:46,790
makes me picture your wedding.

348
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,440
I’m looking forward to it.

349
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,440
Miss Fan,

350
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,840
you look stunning

351
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,880
in this gown.

352
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,840
Junhao,

353
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,590
what do you think?

354
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,320
It’s up to you.

355
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,470
Do you like it?

356
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,880
I’ve tried three of them.

357
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,110
Which one is the best?

358
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:03,470
They look all the same to me.

359
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,760
Oh, silly,

360
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:08,430
most women

361
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,880
only buy wedding gowns once in a lifetime.

362
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,590
So when they choose them,

363
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:14,520
they also want their partners’ opinions.

364
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:17,150
She’s wearing it for you.

365
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,350
I’m sorry, Yunyi.

366
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,550
I didn’t think that much.

367
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,760
So which one should I wear?

368
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,000
All three of them aren’t good enough.

369
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,440
How about trying some other ones?

370
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,080
It’s OK if you don’t like them,

371
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,440
there will be new arrivals

372
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,590
from abroad shortly.

373
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:40,230
You can come and try them on later.

374
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,400
Miss Fan and Mr. Shan,

375
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,320
you can take them off

376
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,200
and have some tea in the VIP room.

377
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,080
I’ll bring you the albums

378
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,350
for you to choose your wedding photo style.

379
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,600
OK. Thank you.

380
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,370
Sure. Thanks.

381
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:54,000
You’re welcome.

382
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,050
Junhao.

383
00:16:59,240 --> 00:16:59,980
Let’s go.

384
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,320
Be careful. Slowly.

385
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,460
= Taurus Meteor Shower =

386
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,580
= Invitation for
the Tourism and Culture Festival =

387
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,920
These three look good.

388
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,590
She’ll try them on once they arrive.

389
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,400
Yes, ma’am.

390
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:33,590
Thank you.

391
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:43,760
By the way,

392
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,830
how about

393
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,880
you two go somewhere special

394
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,880
for your honeymoon?

395
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,680
Junhao.

396
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,680
Junhao!

397
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,420
Mom.

398
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,680
What’s on your mind?

399
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,680
I said after the wedding,

400
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,640
you two should go somewhere special

401
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,190
for the honeymoon.

402
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,140
Mom.

403
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,080
I still have piles of work

404
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,050
to do.

405
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:18,700
I may not have time...

406
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,220
What do you mean?

407
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,590
Getting married is a huge matter.

408
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:25,190
You have to make time for it no matter what.

409
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,050
Mom.

410
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,800
We can go travel when he’s free.

411
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,110
Yunyi,

412
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,710
don’t worry about it.

413
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:34,710
I’ll decide for you.

414
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,400
Junhao, think about it.

415
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,190
You disappeared for months,

416
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,190
but Senwell was still fine.

417
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:42,280
Did it collapse?

418
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:46,040
Taking a vacation for your honeymoon

419
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,520
is being responsible for yourself.

420
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:51,070
Don’t hurt Yunyi’s feelings.

421
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,560
I won’t. Mom, you’re right.

422
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,240
I’ll make arrangements soon.

423
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,960
That’s more like it.

424
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:03,580
Yunyi,

425
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:09,110
Dawei just called.

426
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:11,710
Representative of the Vietnam project agreed

427
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,070
to meet tonight.

428
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,350
I’m sorry. I can’t have dinner with you.

429
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,760
Look at you.

430
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,310
What did I just say?

431
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:22,160
Work isn’t everything.

432
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,590
Your wedding is the priority.

433
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:24,710
You...

434
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:25,710
Mom.

435
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,520
It’s OK.

436
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,640
Everything Junhao is doing

437
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,160
is for Senwell.

438
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,300
Don’t blame him.

439
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,760
You’re too considerate.

440
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:46,430
Junhao,

441
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,010
go ahead.

442
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,920
Mom.

443
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,590
You two have fun.

444
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:53,820
Don’t come back too late.

445
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:54,940
OK.

446
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,380
See you.

447
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,890

Jinzhi,

494
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:28,640
I’d like to have a word with you in private.

495
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:30,040
What is it?

496
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:31,640
Let’s go.

497
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:32,700
Come on.

00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,960
What are you doing?

Make a wish. Do it now.

503
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:14,650
- Let go of me. - What are you doing?

504
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:15,400
This is it.

505
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,060
What?

506
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,580
You can have a clear view here.

507
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:24,230
Let the stars be my witnesses.

508
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,280
I hope

509
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:27,920
Jinzhi and Tang will never make up

510
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,310
and will be enemies forever.

511
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:31,000
Stars, please bless me. Please.

512
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,560
I hope Jinzhi will like me.

513
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,040
This is the brightest.

514
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,310
It’s breathtaking.

515
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:43,000
Do you remember

516
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,950
the meteor shower

517
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,040
16 years ago?

518
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:53,920
I do.

519
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,830
You proposed to me

520
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,830
when the stars were falling.

521
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,070
Jinzhi,

522
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,590
have you ever considered

523
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,560
giving Shengzhe a complete family?

524
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:17,470
It depends on your performance.

525
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,520
OK. Sure.

526
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,190
More stars are coming.

527
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,640
Make a wish.

528
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:28,880
I hope Jinzhi and I will be together again. And...

529
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,820
- It’s huge! - It’s huge!

530
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,970
Yes.

531
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,110
So pretty.

532
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:34,800
Awesome!

533
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,040
Let’s all make a wish.

534
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:36,620
Yeah. OK.

535
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,200
- Make a wish. - Make a wish.

536
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,560
Liyin,

537
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:44,350
I made a wish.

538
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,760
What is it?

539
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,040
I want to grow up quickly

540
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,160
so that I can marry you.

541
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,000
Well, hurry up,

542
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
or I’ll be too old.

543
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,520
What do you know, kid?

544
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,310
I know more than you do.

545
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,700
One more.

546
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,920
- Look! - Wonderful!

547
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,130
It’s twinkling!

548
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,640
So pretty.

549
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,710
Another one.

550
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,470
Make a wish.

551
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,680
Dawei,

552
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:28,880
are you single?

553
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,000
Of course I am.

554
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,470
Since I graduated at 23,

555
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,040
I’ve been working for Mr. Shan.

556
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,830
You know his style at work.

557
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,520
I have no time to date.

558
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,400
Actually, love and life

559
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,190
can be balanced, you know?

560
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,430
I have no time to meet girls.

561
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,710
Now is a good chance.

562
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:01,760
You mean...

563
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,310
You mean Su Liyin?

564
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,590
Yes. Exactly.

565
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:12,830
You’re right.

566
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:15,110
The thing is, Su Liyin

567
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:17,400
has tons of suitors.

568
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,230
If you go after her,

569
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:21,430
she won’t cherish you, got it?

570
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,400
Hey,

571
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,110
I heard she’s your niece.

572
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,070
Does that make you my elder sister?

573
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:29,920
No.

574
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,950
I should call you aunt.

575
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:33,710
No!

576
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,680
She’ll kill you.

577
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,710
Shut up!

578
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:44,590
Well, I’m slightly older than her.

579
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:48,950
You can call me Qiao.

580
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,560
It’s nine years.

581
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,350
Be quiet!

582
00:26:55,470 --> 00:27:00,070
Fengqiao,

583
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,230
why are you still single?

584
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,190
I’m waiting... Waiting for

585
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:11,830
the right one for me. Understand?

586
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:12,560
I mean,

587
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,110
I feel that person has arrived.

588
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:20,160
Gross.

589
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:27,760
I see an eye crust.

590
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,950
What about this one?

591
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,350
This eye, too.

592
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,760
Don’t move. Sit still.

593
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,310
What’s wrong?

594
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:38,920
You also have some.

595
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:40,190
Really?

596
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:40,800
Let’s go.

597
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,830
You two can leave.

598
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:55,560
Guanmei Inn is a nice place.

599
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:58,040
Now I understand

600
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,920
why you chose to stay to help them.

601
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,760
I told you that you wouldn’t be disappointed.

602
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,950
Thank you, Princess Snow.

603
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:09,950
I also figure out

604
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:12,640
why you rejected me.

605
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,680
Bye.

606
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,230
What are you doing?

607
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,680
Making wishes.

608
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:47,110
With so many stars, I can make tons of wishes.

609
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:48,590
Tons of wishes?

610
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,280
What’s your first wish?

611
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:53,880
I hope all the locals

612
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,830
can forever be as happy as they’re now.

613
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,430
What’s the second one?

614
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,190
I hope our family

615
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:04,070
can be rich

616
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:06,400
so that we can pay off my dad’s debt.

617
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,760
What about the third one?

618
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,680
I hope I can become prettier.

619
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:18,830
Did you make a wish?

620
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,040
I’m doing it now.

621
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,430
Stars are so pretty.

622
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,350
Done.

623
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,710
Already?

624
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:31,040
I only made one wish.

625
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,280
What is it?

626
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,710
My wish is

627
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,520
to be with you.

628
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,000
Princess?

629
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,680
Are you OK?

630
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:11,850
Princess.

631
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:12,650
Are you alright?

632
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:13,320
What’s wrong?

633
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,650
Princess.

634
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,560
- What’s going on? - What happened?

635
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,680
Someone fainted?

636
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,950
Dawei.

637
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:33,800
Bad news about Guanmei Inn, Mr. Shan!

638
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,040
Yunyi.

639
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:46,800
Yunyi.

640
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:48,890
Stop drinking.

641
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,010
Ziqian.

642
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,400
I don’t get it.

643
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,830
What did I do wrong?

644
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,160
Why is Junhao’s heart

645
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,160
beating for that woman?

646
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,000
Yunyi,

647
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:12,160
you did nothing wrong.

648
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,280
It’s Junhao’s fault.

649
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:21,350
Ye Qianyu

650
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:23,950
changed him.

651
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,230
You know,

652
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,830
he never lied to me before,

653
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,280
but because of her,

654
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:37,710
he just lied in my face.

655
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:41,040
Why?

656
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,680
You shouldn’t get yourself drunk for that.

657
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,680
Just go ask him.

658
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:57,160
It’s a meteor shower.

659
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,160
It’s real.

660
00:31:58,430 --> 00:31:59,400
So many stars.

661
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:00,560
Hurry and make a wish.

662
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,350
Shooting stars!

663
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,160
Yunyi,

664
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,830
I’ll always be with you.

665
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,430
Ziqian.

666
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,040
Ye Qianyu is only an ordinary girl.

667
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:46,520
What did Junhao see in her?

668
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:49,160
How is she better than me?

669
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,710
What does she have?

670
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:56,430
What about her that attracts Junhao?

671
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,760
Ziqian.

672
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:24,680
Let’s make a wish.

673
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:27,000
Let’s do it.

674
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,430
I hope

675
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:37,470
Junhao can love me as much as I love him.

676
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,070
She should be OK.

677
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:09,950
Why no one is out?

678
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:17,280
How is she, doctor?

679
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,560
Luckily, you took her here in time.

680
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,150
She’s stable now.

681
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,430
But remember,

682
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:26,120
don’t give her food that she’s allergic to again.

683
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:28,190
Can we go see her now?

684
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:29,120
Yes.

685
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,780
- Thank you, doctor. - Thank you, doctor.

686
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,600
Let’s go.

687
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,870
Ye Qianyu,

688
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,080
is this how you prove yourself?

689
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:45,230
I don’t know how it turned out like this.

690
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:46,190
We’ve asked all guests

691
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,670
about their eating habits
and certain food they avoid.

692
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:48,950
No more excuses.

693
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,950
It is what it is now.

694
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:53,280
We’ll do our best to make up for it.

695
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,360
It’s all my fault.

696
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,000
I’ll take full responsibility.

697
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,430
With what?

698
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,560
My sincerity.

699
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:24,080
I’m sorry.

700
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,280
What happened tonight is an accident.

701
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:26,800
We’ll cover

702
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,520
all your medical expenses and damages.

703
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,710
Please forgive me.

704
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,870
What’s the use of saying sorry?

705
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,230
You think money can solve the problem?

706
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,320
I invited you,

707
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,870
so I’ll take full responsibility.

708
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:44,320
Next time, when you invite media,

709
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,520
check carefully first, OK?

710
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:49,360
Don’t bother me again

711
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:50,910
with such a terrible B&B.

712
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:54,560
This never happened in Guanmei Inn before.

713
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,520
I’m really sorry

714
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,390
about what happened to you.

715
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,320
But trust me,

716
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,320
I’ll handle it properly.

717
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:05,190
I asked my assistant to tell you

718
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:07,190
that I’m allergic to Milk Root.

719
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:09,080
Why didn’t you listen?

720
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,870
Milk Root?

721
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,870
Liyin’s list

722
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:19,670
only includes milk.

723
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,390
They’re completely different.

724
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,360
We didn’t use any milk

725
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,840
in all our dishes today,

726
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,080
but our chef’s 100-year-old bree

727
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,630
to braise the chicken

728
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:33,000
contains Milk Root.

729
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,040
It’s not a common ingredient,

730
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,120
so Liyin might’ve made a mistake.

731
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,280
I’m sorry.

732
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,190
It’s our fault.

733
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,000
You’re so careless about guests’ requests.

734
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,760
How could you run an inn well?

735
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:47,910
I’ll sue your inn.

736
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:51,280
We spent days

737
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,800
preparing for this festival

738
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,280
and the viewing of the meteor shower.

739
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,840
We meant to give everyone

740
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,120
the best service.

741
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,120
We never intended for this to happen.

742
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,360
We’ll bear all the consequences.

743
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,000
Please

744
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,670
give us one more chance.

745
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,580
Princess Snow.

746
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:08,970
Whatever your request is,

747
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:11,470
we will do our best to compensate you.

748
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:14,910
I said it’s not about money.

749
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:15,920
She...

750
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:18,090
They must pay the price

751
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:19,290
for their negligence.

752
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,080
I’m sorry.

753
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:27,290
I apologize.

754
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,230
For the accident,

755
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:33,910
Senwell is also responsible.

756
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:34,670
Who are you?

757
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,190
This is the general manager of Senwell,

758
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:37,080
Shan Junhao.

759
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,280
Senwell Group

760
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,840
is the developer of Guanmei Fishing Village

761
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,150
and the host of the meteor shower activity.

762
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:45,430
On behalf of Senwell,

763
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:48,870
please accept my sincere apology

764
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:50,040
and compensation.

765
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:52,390
If you have any complaints or requests,

766
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:53,760
I’m all ears.

767
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,710
This is the first major event

768
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:56,760
that Guanmei Fishing Village has ever held.

769
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,760
Their lack of experience and management

770
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,560
caused this incident.

771
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,160
I hereby

772
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,760
express my deep apology to you.

773
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:10,680
I’m sorry.

774
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:15,320
I hope you can give us another chance.

775
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:16,430
Senwell

776
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:18,010
will transform Guanmei Fishing Village,

777
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:19,230
the inn included,

778
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:22,190
into a perfect resort for tourists.

779
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,180
OK.

780
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:28,630
Since Mr. Shan has apologized himself,

781
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:29,870
I’m sure your company

782
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:31,430
can handle this well.

783
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,000
But,

784
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:35,000
I have one request.

785
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,670
What is it?

786
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:40,600
You always keep a low profile, Mr. Shan.

787
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:42,470
No media

788
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:43,950
have ever published your photos.

789
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:47,230
Do I have the honor

790
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,520
to be the first publisher?

791
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,560
I’m sure

792
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:54,040
after my fans see the photo of us,

793
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,320
they’ll forgive Guanmei Inn.

794
00:38:58,430 --> 00:38:59,560
You mean...

795
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,430
You won’t sue us after that?

796
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,240
OK.

797
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:13,340
Let’s go.

798
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,190
Done.

799
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:30,800
Look.

800
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:37,470
This one it is.

801
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:39,280
Post it on my Weibo page.

802
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,160
Yes.

803
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:41,910
This one is good, too.

804
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:44,060
Mr. Shan,

805
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,660
thank you.

806
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:47,550
Thanks.

807
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:04,320
Hello, Mr. Shan.

808
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,520
How did it go? What’s the result?

809
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:10,120
Mr. Shan put in a good word for us.

810
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,360
Princess Snow decided to let it slide.

811
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:15,560
Thank you for helping us, Mr. Shan.

812
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,630
Thank you, Mr. Shan.

813
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:18,040
Don’t flatter yourselves.

814
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,280
I didn’t do it for you

815
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,320
but for Senwell’s name and image.

816
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,280
Don’t forget

817
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,190
Guanmei Inn belongs to Senwell.

818
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:28,280
Can we continue our business?

819
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:33,430
The renovation is a huge project.

820
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:35,340
You think you can change everything

821
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:36,580
on your own?

822
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:40,910
I’ll send professionals

823
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:41,950
to work here.

824
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:42,710
That’s good.

825
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:44,710
If we can have professional help,

826
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,520
that’ll be great.

827
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,040
You mean...

828
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:54,190
You won’t pull down the inn?

829
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,630
Don’t mistake it.

830
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,320
I didn’t say that.

831
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:08,600
Shan Junhao!

832
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:15,390
You promised to let us continue the business.

833
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:17,150
How dare you try to pull down the inn?

834
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,280
Chen Jinzhi.

835
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:18,630
Mom.

836
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:19,800
What’s the matter with you?

837
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,870
Mom, what are you doing?

838
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:22,470
Mr. Shan helped us.

839
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:24,910
He took care of Princess Snow for us.

840
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,800
That’s right, Mama Jinzhi.

841
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:36,020
I...

842
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:37,910
Mr. Shan.

843
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:44,000
Sorry.

844
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,970
Hello, Yunyi?

845
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:53,560
Junhao. When will you be back?

846
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,120
Don’t wait up.

847
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:57,760
I still have work to do.

848
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,080
I’ll be back later.

849
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:03,390
Work?

850
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:05,560
Fine.

851
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,950
I’m so sorry.

852
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,430
If you don’t mind,

853
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:29,870
you can

854
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:31,430
get changed inside.

855
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:43,600
It’s all my fault...

856
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,280
By the way, Mama Jinzhi,

857
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,950
what about other media?

858
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:52,470
We managed to pacify them.

859
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,190
I’ll explain it to them.

860
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,390
OK. Thanks.

861
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:10,320
I knew

862
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,000
Tonghao would help us.

863
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:13,710
Didn’t you splash water over him?

864
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,040
Where do you want to go?

865
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:25,470
Guanmei Inn.

866
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:30,470
OK.

867
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:35,560
He persuaded Princess Snow

868
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:38,120
not to sue us.

869
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,190
Besides,

870
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,280
he’s also agreed to let us continue the business.

871
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:17,840
Tonghao?

872
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:28,320
Jinzhi,

873
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,430
I have something to tell you.

874
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:36,520
Listen...

875
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:37,190
What?

876
00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:37,870
’This thing...

877
00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:39,620
- Say it. - Look,

878
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,280
we can’t discuss it here.

879
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:55,080
Is this outfit Tonghao’s?

880
00:44:57,710 --> 00:44:58,800
Yeah.

881
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,870
Isn’t the size just about right?

882
00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:02,800
I bought it for him.

883
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:13,630

00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:51,980
