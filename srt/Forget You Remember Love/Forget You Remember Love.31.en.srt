Good night.

Qianyu...

14
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,360
See you tomorrow.

15

What’s wrong?

16
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,470
Mr. Shan,

17
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,000
I looked into

18
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,830
the news published about you and Ye Qianyu.

19
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,160
It was Xie Quan

20
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,180
who asked the tabloids to release it.

21
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,710
He’s been holding a grudge against me.

22
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,560
Guess that was payback.

23
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,380
Those photos

24
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:19,800
are the ones Zhang Minghan

25
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,230
showed to the board last time.

26
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,810
Outsiders couldn’t get them

27
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:23,960
unless

28
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,110
they had people inside.

29
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,030
Dig deeper.

30
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:31,830
Yes.

31
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,270
Alright.

32
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,030
If there’s nothing else, you can go back to rest.

33
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,720
Mr. Shan.

34
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,080
Anything else?

35
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,110
Are you really going to...

36
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:47,670
I’m sorry.

37
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:49,720
I overstepped my bounds.

38
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:52,910
See you tomorrow.

39
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,630
Junhao.

40
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,000
Yunyi?

41
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,350
Why are you sitting in the dark?

42
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,390
I can’t see.

43
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,790
Having light or not makes no difference.

44
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,230
Where are you going?

45
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,110
Junhao.

46
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,760
I love you.

47
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,000
You don’t need to respond to me now

48
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,230
because I’ll wait for your response

49
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,230
for the rest of my life.

52
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,110
Two days ago,

53
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:01,270
we went to Granny Huazi’s to bring her supplies.

54
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,110
On the way back,

55
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,640
we accidentally

56
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,880
fell into the heavenly pit in the Devil Forest.

57
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,830
Qianyu was scared.

58
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,720
She said she still has

59
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,920
tons of dreams.

60
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,760
She didn’t want to die.

61
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,950
What a silly girl.

62
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:19,720
I will

63
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,390
help her fulfill all her dreams.

64
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,950
Today, I finally realize

65
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,550
that Qianyu does care about me.

66
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:36,670
The moment I saw her coming from afar,

67
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,030
I’ve put Indonesia behind.

68
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,880
I’ll stay in Guanmei.

69
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,200
I no longer want to leave.

70
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,030
I couldn’t help kissing her,

71
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,030
the girl who’s destined

72
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,200
to be part of my life.

73
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:09,400
I don’t like Taichu.

74
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:12,670
He’s always around Qianyu.

75
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,520
But,

76
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,760
I won’t allow him to steal her away.

77
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,400
Hey, hey, hey.

78
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,150
Do you have everything with you?

79
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,840
Passport, ID,

80
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,400
phone, power bank...

81
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,000
Yeah. I have all of them.

82
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,000
Alright.

83
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:38,810
Hey,

84
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:39,960
I have a gift

85
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,550
for you.

86
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,470
My grandfather left it to me,

87
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:46,000
a Polaroid automatic land camera.

88
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,910
When you see amazing views,

89
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,440
you can take photos of them.

90
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:50,200
Take it.

91
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,080
Thank you.

92
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,640
Ye Qianyu,

93
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,470
put all gifts for me in this bag.

94
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,960
Make sure it’ll be full.

95
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,640
But now, you can put your gift in.

96
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:00,670
Thank you.

97
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:02,760
Qianyu,

98
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,350
I made this hanky for you.

99
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,820
There’s your favorite frog on it.

100
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,000
Here you are.

101
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,080
Thank you, Fengqiao.

102
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,760
Qianyu,

103
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,520
this is my photo.

104
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,080
I’m always with you.

105
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,280
Don’t miss me too much.

106
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,350
Qianyu, Qianyu,

107
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:22,150
this is my gift for you.

108
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,030
Is it the soap in our inn?

109
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,910
Your gift sucks.

110
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:30,150
I didn’t have time to prepare anything.

111
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:32,910
Qianyu, Qianyu,

112
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,080
this is a lucky egg.

113
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,520
It didn’t break after falling on the floor.

114
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,520
I boiled it.

115
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,550
Eat it on the way.

116
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,320
Thank you, Master.

117
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:43,840
I almost forgot.

118
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:49,000
Qianyu,

119
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:52,470
have fun out there.

120
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:53,670
Don’t worry about the money.

121
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,670
You know

122
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,840
the password.

123
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,760
Take it, take it.

124
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,200
Taichu,

125
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,280
please take good care of Qianyu.

126
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,230
Don’t worry, Tang.

127
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,440
Tang.

128
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,590
Please look after Chen and Shengzhe for me.

129
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,280
Consider it done.

130
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,230
No problem.

131
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,000
I don’t need him.

132
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,440
Butterball!

133
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,000
He’s still staying in Shengzhe’s room.

134
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,080
Hey, why did you bring that up?

135
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,980
Don’t touch me.

136
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:30,710
Just mind your own business.

137
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,280
Goodbye.

138

- Bye. - Bye-bye.

144
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,800
Have a safe trip.

145

Ziqian,

162
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,020
you’re up to more

163
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,110
than just receiving guests, right?

164
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:50,920
- It’s been a while. - Indeed.

165
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,910
So hot!

166
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:35,110
Mrs. Shan.

167
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,840
Let me.

168
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,030
This is your big day.

169
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,030
Be happy.

170
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,760
Junhao,

171
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,230
right now,

172
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,520
you may resent me.

173
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,470
But trust me,

174
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:11,280
this is the best for you.

175
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,320
I know, Mom.

176
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:20,670
My son is the hottest.

177
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:24,710
Qianyu, I’ve planned out everything.

178
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,520
Our first stop is Provence in France.

179
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,960
Then we’ll go to Paris.

180
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,150
After that,

181
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,580
we’ll head to Spain.

182
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,350
Qianyu?

183
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,470
Nothing.

184
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,350
All done, Miss Fan.

185
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:58,030
Thanks.

186
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,350
Ziqian.

187
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,230
Is it you?

188
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,790
You look

189
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,230
stunning as usual.

190
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:32,590
Yunyi,

191
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,230
why don’t you reconsider...

192
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:37,110
Ziqian.

193
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:41,400
You have a lot to do today.

194
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,200
You have to be

195
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,910
both the best man and the bridesmaid.

196
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,900
Is Junhao ready?

197
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,400
I’ll go check.

198
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,430
Mr. Shan,

199
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:29,280
let me tell you a story.

200
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,070
I still remember

201
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,070
it was a winter

202
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:39,520
when I left home for my dream.

203
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,680
Since then,

204
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,590
people in my village

205
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:46,520
haven’t had any water.

206
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,310
What is that?

207
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,830
Not... Not funny?

208
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:09,590
I meant to cheer you up.

209
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,190
Junhao,

210
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:27,830
are you ready?

211
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:30,830
The ceremony will begin in 30 minutes.

212
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,190
I see.

213
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,280
What’s wrong, Taichu?

214
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,000
Qianyu,

215
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,310
I told you

216
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:00,350
leaving

217
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:02,040
isn’t about time and space.

218
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,110
If you can’t let it go yourself,

219
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,710
a change of place is of no use.

220
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,160
Taichu,

221
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,150
I...

222
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:17,360
Are you sure you want to leave?

223
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,520
I need time

224
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,560
to forget about the past.

225
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:34,400
Qianyu,

226
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,110
everyone’s heart is small.

227
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,110
It’s only big enough for one person.

228
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,470
Where are we going, Taichu?

229
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,520
The place your heart desires.

230
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,760
Let’s welcome the bride and the groom.

231
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,160
Ziqian.

232
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:35,710
Ziqian?

233
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,430
In this world,

234
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:30,280
there’s this most beautiful language

235
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,950
and the brightest light,

236
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,760
which is love.

237
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:38,470
Love is

238
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:41,310
where one heart meets the other,

239
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:45,880
where one person keeps the other company.

240
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:49,800
Today, we’re all here

241
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,920
to witness Mr. Shan Junhao

242
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:55,520
and Miss Fan Yunyi’s sacred moment.

243
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,230
They’ll announce their trust and commitment

244
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:01,190
to each other.

245
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,470
Miss Fan Yunyi,

246
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:07,000
will you take Mr. Shan Junhao

247
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,760
as your husband?

248
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:13,190
Whether you’re in weal or woe, rich or poor,

249
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,310
happy or sad,

250
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:18,400
you’ll love him unconditionally

251
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,400
and be loyal to him

252
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:20,830
till death do you part.

253
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,680
Will you?

254
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,520
Yes.

255
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,920
Mr. Shan Junhao,

256
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,000
will you take Miss Fan Yunyi

257
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
as your wife?

258
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,830
Will you love her unconditionally

259
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,430
till death do you part?

260
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,520
Will you?

261
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,830
Let me go with you.

262
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:35,360
What’s wrong?

263
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,630
Is he shy? Why didn’t he answer it?

264
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:41,960
He seems a bit coy.

265
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,300
What is he doing?

266
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:47,920
Mr. Shan Junhao,

267
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:51,280
will you take Miss Fan Yunyi

268
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,070
as your wife?

269
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:02,560
Junhao?

270
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,720
Who is this? Do you know her?

271
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,580
Who is she? Never seen her before.

272
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,900
Don’t know.

273
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,060
Doesn’t seem to be one of the guests.

274
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:49,580
That’s right.

275
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,760
- What is she doing here? - Yeah.

276
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:56,350
What are you doing here?

277
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,860
Isn’t she that village girl?

278
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,490
Yeah. She really is.

279
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,920
I’m here to give them my blessings.

280
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:21,880
Mr. Shan,

281
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:23,830
Director Fan,

282
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,190
may you have a happy marriage.

283
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:41,180
She’s Ye Qianyu?

284
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,350
Yes.

285
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:50,800
Why is she here?

286
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:56,820
They’re getting married.

287
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,120
Yeah.

288
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,550
How dare she

289
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:00,940
barge into their wedding?

290
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,300
Call an ambulance!

291
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:44,240
Qianyu!

292
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,560
Qianyu!

293
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:55,530
Junhao!

294
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:56,410
Junhao!

295
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,300
Are they OK?

296
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,740
Call an ambulance! Now!

297
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,100
Do something!

298
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:10,780
- Mr. Shan! - Qianyu!

299
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:11,520
Hurry! Move!

300
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,440
- Mr. Shan! - Junhao!

301
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,170
- Junhao! - Junhao!

302
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:15,310
How are they?

303
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:16,860
- Mr. Shan! - Junhao!

304
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,880
Yunyi!

305
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:22,000
Be careful.

306
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,640
Junhao! Can you hear me, Junhao?

307
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:29,280
Junhao!

308
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,430
Call an ambulance!

309
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:33,230
Stay here. Don’t move. I’ll go check on Junhao.

310
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,430
Mr. Shan!

311
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:36,470
Mr. Shan!

312
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,560
Mr. Shan!

313
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:45,280
Junhao! Qianyu! Are you OK?

314
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,190
Junhao!

315
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,710
Junhao!

316
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,000
- Mr. Shan! - Junhao!

317
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,590
Mr. Shan!

318
00:31:58,430 --> 00:31:59,430
Junhao!

319
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,010
- Wake up, Junhao! - Mr. Shan!

320
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:07,520
Junhao, open your eyes, please!

321
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,600
Junhao!

322
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:18,560
- Hello? We need an ambulance!
- Wake up!

323
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,160
Can you hear me, Junhao?

324
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,220
- Yes! Please wake up quickly!
- Junhao!

325
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:41,880
He passed out. Is he gonna be OK?

326
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:45,420
His head is bleeding.

327
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,310
Junhao! Junhao!

328
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:53,230
Slowly. Careful.

329
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:57,190
Junhao! Junhao!

330
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,470
Slowly.

331
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:00,760
- Be careful. - Careful.

332
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:07,940
= OR =

333
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,520
Excuse me,

334
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,040
did you see Miss Fan Yunyi?

335
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:22,800
No.

336
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,740
= Yunyi =

337
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:35,530
- The number you’ve dialed can’t be reached.
- Pick up!

338
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:37,120
Please try again later.

339
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,230
Qianyu, let’s get you bandaged.

340
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,560
I’m fine.

341
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:56,040
Why did you come?

342
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
It’s all your fault!

343
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,160
Mrs. Shan,

344
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,920
hadn’t it for her,

345
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:05,310
your son’s condition would’ve become worse.

346
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:06,800
Yes, Chairman.

347
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:08,280
Qianyu injured herself

348
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:10,190
in order to save Mr. Shan.

349
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:17,710
Qianyu, you should get treated, too.

350
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,150
Have a seat, Chairman.

351
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:38,080
Where did she go?

352
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:51,390
Hello?

353
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,040
Mrs. Lin,

354
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,390
is Yunyi at home?

355
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:55,520
No, she isn’t.

356
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:57,000
Wait there.

357
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:58,360
If she gets back,

358
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,430
call me immediately.

359
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:00,910
Yes, Mr. Ziqian.

360
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:10,560
Why is she walking in the street
in a wedding gown?

361
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,670
Look.

362
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,000
What’s going on?

363
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,950
So odd.

364
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,120
Take some photos.

365
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,700
Gosh, is she crazy?

366
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:24,380
What happened to her?

367
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,880
Why is she out like this?

368
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,600
Yeah. So weird.

369
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,760
- Let’s go. Let’s go. - Come on.

370
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,320
The patient was hit by heavy objects

371
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,470
and developed a subgaleal hematoma.

372
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,950
The severe blood loss caused his shock.

373
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,120
We’ve removed some clots

374
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,000
through puncture.

375
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:34,600
He should be OK.

376
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:37,520
Thank you very much, doctor.

377
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,570
You’re welcome.

378
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,320
Thank god Mr. Shan is fine.

379
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:43,800
Chairman,

380
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,840
you still need to

381
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,320
handle the aftermath.

382
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,000
Please.

383
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,430
Find out who did this.

384
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:01,600
The culprit must pay for hurting Junhao!

385
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,280
Yes, Chairman.

386
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,430
The venue has been secured.

387
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:06,080
I’ll investigate it now.

388
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,230
Ziqian?

389
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,150
What took you so long?

390
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:13,080
Is Yunyi here?

391
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,600
No.

392
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:18,560
I didn’t see her

393
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:19,950
after the accident.

394
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,760
No one took her here?

395
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:25,390
It was a mess.

396
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,040
I also forgot.

397
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,040
You only care about Junhao

398
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,670
but didn’t know Yunyi is missing?

399
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,800
She can’t see anything!

400
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:35,840
What if something happens to her?

401
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:38,910
Zi...

402
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:42,120
Yunyi is missing?

403
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:45,360
What are you waiting for, Dawei?

404
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:46,760
Go find her!

405
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,280
I’m on it.

406
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:14,480
How are you holding up?

407
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:37,340
Don’t take such risks ever again.

408
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:52,830
I...

409
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,470
I’d save

410
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:56,760
whoever was there.

411
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,520
You regret it?

412
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:08,280
Regret what?

413
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,560
If not, why are you here?

414
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:20,280
I’m here to convince myself to give up.

415
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,120
Do you mean

416
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:25,040
you still haven’t?

417
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:34,910
This is the third time I’ve saved you.

418
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:38,520
I must’ve owed you a ton

419
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,230
in my previous lives.

420
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:42,280
I owe you.

421
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:46,630
They can call me a cheating bastard

422
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,190
or a selfish jerk.

423
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:51,000
I don’t care.

424
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,470
I’ve decided

425
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,670
to cling on to you.

426
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,120
I’ll repay

427
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,840
what I owe you with the rest of my life.

428
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:22,230
Mr. Ziqian.

429
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:23,230
Is Yunyi back?

430
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:24,360
No.

431
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,430
Is everything OK?

432
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:27,760
Where are Mrs. and Mr. Shan?

433
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:29,150
Mr. Ziqian.

434
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:30,520
What happened?

435
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:32,320
Mr. Ziqian!

436
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,710
Qianyu,

437
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,280
Tonghao was in love with you

438
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,800
and so is Shan Junhao.

439
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,360
I guess

440
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,520
this is fate.

441
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,190
It’s all your fault.

442
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,320
I was about to leave.

443
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,120
I didn’t realize

444
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,950
until the accident happened

445
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,430
that I cannot stop caring about you.

446
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:50,000
I won’t allow you to run away from me.

447
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,520
That’s irresponsible.

448
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:57,760
You’re already married.

449
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:01,000
I didn’t make the vow.

450
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:03,360
Don’t go against your heart.

451
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:14,080
Come here.

452
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,190
What?

453
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:18,360
I want to take a closer look at you.

454
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,560
What’s there to look?

455
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:31,600
What’s wrong? It hurts again?

456
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:38,320
Got you!

457
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,150
Your eyes have given you away.

458
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,560
What?

459
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:51,000
From now on,

460
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,040
you cannot leave me again.

461
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:54,760
Let go.

462
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:55,950
No.

463
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:56,840
Let go of me!

464
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:57,560
I won’t.

465
00:43:57,980 --> 00:43:59,500
- Let go! - No!

466
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:02,040
What are you doing here?

467
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:03,670
Mrs. Shan.

468
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:05,820
Mom.

469
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:07,000
I’m leaving.

470
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:08,910
Qianyu.

471
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:09,840
Junhao.

472
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,600
Yunyi is missing!

473
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:15,760
What?

474
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,470
