Senwell?

= Qianyu I hope you can come to Senwell tomorrow.
I need you. Shan Junhao =

13
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:56,830
Thanks.

14
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,550
How could he do this to you?

15
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,630
Who does he think he is?

16
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,590
He’s rich, so what?

17
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,520
If Tonghao wants to see you,

18
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,190
why didn’t he call you?

19
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,190
Who would still write a letter?

20
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:14,110
And,

21
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,030
= To Ye Qianyu of Guanmei Inn =
it shouldn’t have been sent to the inn.

22
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,320
The address should be our store.

23
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,000
What’s going on?

24
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:22,960
This letter looks fishy.

25
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,600
I have to go

26
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,750
regardless.

27
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:29,800
You can’t.

28
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,360
If Tonghao misses you,

29
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,160
he can come here.

30
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,910
Don’t be so obedient and humble.

31
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:36,830
Yes.

32
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:37,880
Qianyu,

33
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,550
where is your pride?

34
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,000
Mom.

35
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:42,880
Tonghao needs me.

36
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,030
Fan Yunyi said he had forgotten about you.

37
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,000
Has he shown up once since he left?

38
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:50,960
He thought

39
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,750
he could summon you there by a single letter?

40
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,160
What did he think of you?

41
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:57,630
I never thought Tonghao would be like this.

42
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,670
He doesn’t deserve my friendship.

43
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:00,560
Hey,

44
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,000
may I say something?

45
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,270
I think Qianyu should go.

46
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,360
They need to clear things up face to face.

47
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,320
What are you saying?

48
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:10,960
What do you mean?

49
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,160
You’d rather

50
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,720
see Qianyu get bullied?

51
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,830
- No, I just... - Shut up!

52
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,430
- You mistook it. I… - How could you?

53
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,670
I allow you to eat and sleep here for free,

54
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,630
- yet you speak for others.
- I pay you two thousand every month.

55
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,720
I’m not a freeloader.

56
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,750
That’s peanuts compared with how much you eat.

57
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:23,720
That’s still money.

58
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:24,800
Enough.

59
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,470
Can you two pause for a while?

60
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,910
We’re talking about

61
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,520
Ye Qianyu and Tonghao.

62
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:37,670
Mom,

63
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,720
please let me go.

64
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,320
I need to talk to him.

65
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:45,630
Go ahead,

66
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:46,670
Qianyu.

67
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,080
Perhaps when you see him,

68
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,190
you’ll be able to move on.

69
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,830
- I already paid. - How could you…

70
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,630
Why can’t I have it?

71
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,600
Give me yours.

72
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,440
She’s here. Take her to the conference room.

73
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,510
Yes, boss.

74
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,340
Everyone,

75
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,740
since Shan Junhao went AWOL

76
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,000
and missed,

77
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,950
I’ve been in charge

78
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,720
for a while.

79
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,040
I believe

80
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,720
my contribution

81
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,230
is obvious to all.

82
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,550
However,

83
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:27,480
some people are still against me.

84
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,200
If the core team is split up,

85
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,920
it’ll shake Senwell.

86
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,670
So this meeting today

87
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,350
is to resolve differences.

88
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,000
- Yes. - Yes.

89
00:05:58,830 --> 00:05:59,510
Taichu.

90
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,200
Mama Jinzhi.

91
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:02,950
Where’s Qianyu?

92
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,160
She went to Senwell.

93
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,640
She really did?

94
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,390
I think there's something wrong.

95
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,950
You do?

96
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:16,790
I feel the same way,

97
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,550
but can’t pinpoint what’s wrong.

98
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,350
Is she going to be OK?

99
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,950
What about I go to Senwell
and check on her?

100
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,480
OK, that's the best.
Keep an eye on her.

101
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:28,480
See you.

102
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:31,920
Sorry for troubling you.

103
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:32,320
It’s OK.

104
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:35,550
Zhang Minghan.

105
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,160
You know what you’ve done?

106
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,510
Investment of underwater hotels in Madagascar,

107
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,070
negotiation failed.

108
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,270
Land development in Sumatra,

109
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:47,480
pending further decisions.

110
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,480
Resort Project in Malaysia,

111
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,640
postponed indefinitely.

112
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,040
Are those your so-called contribution?

113
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:58,670
Those projects didn’t go smoothly,

114
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:03,000
but the company didn’t lose money.

115
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,510
Looks like

116
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,760
you didn’t do your homework well.

117
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:07,880
It’s OK.

118
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:09,880
I can tell you.

119
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:14,440
We purchased Manta on Phuket Island in Thailand,

120
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:17,440
and signed the cooperation agreement
with Stamford.

121
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,320
Investment in the beach park in Sri Lanka

122
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,510
starts to pay off.

123
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,270
If you take pride

124
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:24,760
in those so-called victories,

125
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,110
you’re short-sighted.

126
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:29,560
Manta is uncompetitive.

127
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,200
Stamford is in huge debts.

128
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,440
Sri Lanka will soon declare a state of emergency.

129
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,880
Have you picked up on any of that?

130
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:38,920
Don’t forget

131
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:43,320
you bombed us with Guanmei Development Project,

132
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:44,390
and then disappeared.

133
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,550
GQ Ventures almost canceled the cooperation

134
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,320
due to the long-overdue construction.

135
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,480
You know?

136
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,600
Mr. Zhao.

137
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,440
There you are, Qianyu.

138
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,110
Where’s Shan Junhao?

139
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,920
Follow me.

140
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,550
Guanmei Development Project

141
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,880
could’ve been launched as planned,

142
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,640
yet you

143
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,640
got cold feet

144
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,910
because of a few dolphins.

145
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,110
Speaking of that,

146
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,790
you’re the culprit,

147
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:46,960
Shan Junhao.

148
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,840
What do you mean?

149
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,420
Is it true?

150
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,260
Can’t tell.

151
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,840
Didn’t you say Shan Junhao wants to see me?

152
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,760
Why are there so many people?

153
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,760
Shan Junhao.

154
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,670
You went missing for so long.

155
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,150
Don’t you think you owe us an explanation?

156
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,400
You know how much damage

157
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,550
your AWOL caused the company?

158
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,470
He didn’t go AWOL.

159
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,230
He was hit by a car and suffered from memory loss.

160
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:39,800
Memory loss?

161
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,540
How could it be?

162
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,200
It’s totally different from what we knew.

163
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:42,980
Is it true?

164
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,370
- Yeah. - Memory loss?

165
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,150
Memory loss?

166
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,590
Never heard about it.

167
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,440
Shan Junhao.

168
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,840
Is what she said true?

169
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,000
Yes.

170
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:01,400
Miss Ye Qianyu,

171
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:04,200
tell us what Shan Jun...

172
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:04,910
Oh, sorry,

173
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:07,230
Tonghao.

174
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,320
What Tonghao did for Guanmei Fishing Village

175
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,520
when he lost his memory.

176
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:16,520
I heard he’s your hero.

177
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:19,550
Yes.

178
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,470
Tonghao is our hero.

179
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,840
After he came to our island,

180
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,710
he helped us run the inn better

181
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:27,030
and found Chinese white dolphins.

182
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:29,520
- Is that true? - Is it true?

183
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,820
- Is that true? - Right.

184
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,080
How did he know?

185
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,220
- Is it trustworthy? - Yeah.

186
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,230
- What happened? - Is it possible?

187
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,110
Senwell invested a huge amount of resources

188
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,670
in Guanmei Development Project.

189
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,910
It could’ve started as scheduled,

190
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,000
but the appearance of white dolphins

191
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,230
halted our project.

192
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,280
The one who found them

193
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,520
and stopped Senwell’s project

194
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,350
was you, Shan Junhao.

195
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,320
Impossible!

196
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:00,280
Shan Junhao,

197
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,520
because of you,

198
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,440
all our efforts went down the drain.

199
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,470
You’re unqualified for the GM position,

200
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,320
and the company should sue you.

201
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,640
I have no memory of doing that in Guanmei.

202
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,590
I only remember

203
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,640
that Miss Ye Qianyu

204
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,150
is a liar.

205
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,320
The first time I met her,

206
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:34,880
she extorted money from me.

207
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,790
I almost fell off from her hot air balloon.

208
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,760
Not only did she refuse to take responsibility,

209
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:45,710
but she also accused me of damaging her balloon.

210
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,550
Is someone like her

211
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,520
really reliable?

212
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,690
Yeah, Shan Junhao is right.

213
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:57,390
- Right. - Yeah.

214
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,730
I don’t think we can believe her, either.

215
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,650
- Mr. Shan must’ve been deceived. - Yeah.

216
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:03,860
And she looks like…

217
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:04,670
Shan Junhao.

218
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,590
you’re a heartless man.

219
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,030
I learned that you and Miss Ye Qianyu

220
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,760
were a couple in Guanmei Fishing Village.

221
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,080
Now, you’re throwing her under the bus?

222
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,350
She fabricated the whole thing.

223
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:22,910
Everyone,

224
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,790
don’t believe a word she said.

225
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,710
Fabricated?

226
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:28,790
Everyone in Guanmei Fishing Village

227
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,470
can prove that.

228
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,670
We can’t be related in any way.

229
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,550
As the head of this company,

230
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:39,000
you ruined the key project.

231
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,710
You’re ridiculous.

232
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,400
Gentlemen,

233
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,640
I believe you all know

234
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,000
what kind of leader Senwell needs.

235
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,390
- Yeah. - How could he do that?

236
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,600
Junhao.

237
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,940
This is our interest.

238
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,910
He has put so much effort into this project!

239
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:28,320
People make mistakes.

240
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,110
Shan Junhao is right.

241
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,280
I am a liar.

242
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,380
See? I said so.

243
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,850
I make a living by lying and cheating.

244
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,400
- He won’t do that. - Yeah.

245
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,670
While he was memoryless,

246
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,350
I immediately recognized that he’s Shan Junhao.

247
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,200
But,

248
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,520
I concealed that fact

249
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,550
and named him Tonghao

250
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,840
to approach him

251
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:55,960
so that I could squeeze money out of him.

252
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,200
I even seduced him

253
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:04,670
in order to realize my dream
of marrying a rich man.

254
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,110
But who knew

255
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,200
he regained his memory

256
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,470
and saw through my lies.

257
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,280
Right now,

258
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,960
I have nothing else to say.

259
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,030
I found white dolphins.

260
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,200
I took the photo to the site

261
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:25,640
to stop the demolition of Guanmei Inn.

262
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,440
It’s all my fault.

263
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,150
It’s nothing to do with Shan Junhao.

264
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:45,960
Zhang Minghan,

265
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,400
you heard her?

266
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:52,590
She already admitted to the scam.

267
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:55,640
Don’t you try to

268
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,670
trump up charges against me.

269
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,590
Shan Junhao is right.

270
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:15,670
It is a scam.

271
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:23,200
He’s capable and qualified

272
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,200
to be your chairman

273
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:29,910
and general manager.

274
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,960
Sorry for wasting your time.

275
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,440
Gentlemen,

276
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,440
Ye Qianyu’s change of attitude

277
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,790
shows she loves Shan Junhao dearly.

278
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,710
In order to keep his position,

279
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,880
she described herself as a fraud.

280
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,520
But it’s OK.

281
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,390
We have other evidence.

282
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:03,990
- Other evidence? - Other evidence?

283
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:04,690
What is it?

284
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,610
- Look! - Is it fake?

285
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:11,890
- Yeah. - Photos can’t be fake.

286
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,060
Right now, anything can be faked.

287
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:16,040
Abandoning a senior position

288
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:17,400
for love,

289
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,430
how romantic!

290
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,590
Yes.

291
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,280
- This one is nice. - Look at this photo.

292
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:24,880
- It’s not his fault that he was memoryless.
- Yes.

293
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:27,260
- It was taken when he lost his memory.
- This one looks good, too.

294
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,920
Who knows? Anything is possible.

295
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,790
- Is it real? - Yeah.

296
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:33,730
It must be.

297
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:35,830
How could he damage the company’s interest?

298
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:36,690
Is it fabricated?

299
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:37,800
It’s true that when he had no memory, he…

300
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,520
I’ve never seen him

301
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,560
so happy before.

302
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:43,280
It’s obvious

303
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,280
whether Ye Qianyu lied or not.

304
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,920
Now, let’s elect the new general manager

305
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,190
by a show of hands.

306
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,070
Well,

307
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:03,920
the result is clear.

308
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,000
Next,

309
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:06,640
I’m honored to announce

310
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,800
the new general manager is...

311
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,590
Hold on!

312
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:22,560
Wait!

313
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:38,950
Director Xu.

314
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:40,800
There you are again.

315
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,000
This is a board meeting.

316
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,160
There isn’t a place for you.

317
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:52,800
Everyone,

318
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,760
sorry to interrupt,

319
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:57,590
but it’s urgent,

320
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,760
so I burst in on you.

321
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:03,160
I’d like to introduce

322
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,350
two key witnesses to you

323
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,560
to help uncover the truth.

324
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:12,710
Who knows?

325
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:13,820
General manager.

326
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,940
Don’t know.

327
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,310
Director Xu.

328
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:20,400
Who are they?

329
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:22,560
A while ago,

330
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:26,470
Shan Junhao had another car accident.

331
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,520
They’re responsible for it.

332
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:36,640
Director Xu.

333
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,710
You mean Shan Junhao

334
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:40,520
was hit again?

335
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:41,520
Exactly.

336
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,800
He just regained his memory

337
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,950
and remembered who he was,

338
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:48,590
but right at this time,

339
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,520
on his way home,

340
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,710
these two hit him with a car.

341
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,000
They’ve admitted

342
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,470
that they were told to do so

343
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,760
and the people who ordered them

344
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,070
are right here in this room.

345
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:02,420
No way.

346
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,940
It can’t be.

347
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,640
Who did it?

348
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,100
How dare someone do this!

349
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:16,640
That’s right.

350
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,270
Hitting others on purpose is ruthless.

351
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:19,130
This…

352
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:22,090
This… Hitting people…

353
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,590
Director Xu.

354
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,070
Who are they?

355
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,070
The second accident

356
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,760
made me suspect

357
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,400
the first one.

358
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,000
What are the odds

359
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,310
that someone got hit twice?

360
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:37,760
Zhang Minghan,

361
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:39,830
you know

362
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,830
what I’m talking about.

363
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,070
Let them point out who did it.

364
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,880
I can’t wait to see

365
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,830
who the masterminds are.

366
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:10,830
Mr. Qiu, Mr. Lin?

367
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:12,070
- They did it? - How dare you

368
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,310
point fingers at me!

369
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:16,830
I’ve never met you.

370
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,710
Are you sure?

371
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:18,480
They did it.

372
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,350
Their motive

373
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,760
was to make Shan Junhao disappear

374
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,520
and prevent him from getting back his position.

375
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:29,850
That was murder!

376
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,890
How could they do that? Unbelievable!

377
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,190
- What were they thinking?
- What’s wrong with them?

378
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,780
- They shouldn’t have done that. - Yes.

379
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,680
It’s so out of line!

380
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,110
Mr. Qiu. Mr. Lin.

381
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,400
The police will find out the truth.

382
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:47,400
I’d like to know

383
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,470
who gave you

384
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,070
the order.

385
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,520
It has nothing to do with me.

386
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:01,400
Gentlemen,

387
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,590
you can tell everything to the police.

388
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,230
They’ll give you enough time.

389
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,070
Go with us.

390
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,360
- Look at them. – Look.

391
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,720
- They deserve it. - Who knew they would do that?

392
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,700
Yes. Can’t believe they did it.

393
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,070
This matter is clear.

394
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,950
As to who should be the manager,

395
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,400
I hope you can think carefully.

396
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:34,810
That’s right.

397
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,000
Yes.

398
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,640
Given what happened,

399
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,040
it not only concerns personal safety,

400
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,520
but more importantly, the future of the company.

401
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,110
We need

402
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:53,560
a righteous, decisive, and reliable leader

403
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,760
instead of

404
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,400
a greedy

405
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,880
and unscrupulous culprit.

406
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,290
- Director Xu is right. - I agree.

407
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,290
- We can’t decide rashly. - Exactly.

408
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,520
I propose

409
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:11,190
Zhang Minghan be suspended, pending investigation.

410
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,830
Meanwhile, Shan Junhao

411
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:13,950
will take over his place for now.

412
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:15,920
Once the investigation completes,

413
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,190
we’ll discuss the formal appointment.

414
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,110
Any objections?

415
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,000
No.

416
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:22,560
I agree.

417
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,350
Me, too.

418
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,520
OK. Let’s call it a day then.

419
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:36,710
Shan Junhao,

420
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:42,000
You got lucky today.

421
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,520
At this stage,

422
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,920
you still won’t give up?

423
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,560
The three of us grew up together.

424
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,190
We’re like brothers.

425
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,560
I can’t believe you’d be so coldblooded.

426
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:55,760
Ziqian.

427
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,680
You really think I’d sink so low?

428
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,070
I was never part of it.

429
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,070
I’ll get to the bottom of it.

430
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,070
Luckily, Ziqian came in time,

431
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,760
otherwise,

432
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:27,800
Zhang Minghan would gain complete control.

433
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:29,680
Ziqian.

434
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,520
How did you find those men?

435
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:34,800
Ever since you went missing,

436
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:36,830
I’ve never stopped investigating it.

437
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,230
Thank you.

438
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,110
You’ve been saying that a lot lately.

439
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:50,680
Come on.

440
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,190
Let’s go home and eat.

441
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:09,880
You should all have a good rest.

442
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:10,950
Starting from tomorrow,

443
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,560
you’ll be buried with work.

444
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:13,680
OK.

445
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:28,920
Junhao.

446
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:32,280
Where are you going?

447
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,800
I want to ask her

448
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:39,350
what on earth happened to me in Guanmei.

449
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,430
Did I really date her?

450
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,350
Why is her story different from yours?

451
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,350
People like Ye Qianyu

452
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:50,470
would do anything for money.

453
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,590
She recognized you

454
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,560
but lied to you on purpose.

455
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:57,000
You can’t believe her.

456
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,950
Had she

457
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,800
been Zhang Minghan’s pawn,

458
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,830
why would she have admitted

459
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,560
that she was a liar?

460
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,710
How would that benefit her?

461
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:13,710
Her lies were full of flaws

462
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,110
and they couldn’t be continued.

463
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:20,830
Then what about those photos?

464
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:32,760
Junhao!

465
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:34,640
Yunyi,

466
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,000
Junhao has the right to know the truth.

467
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,590
We should trust him

468
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,110
that he can handle it well.

469
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:51,830
Tonghao!

470
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:55,430
I’m not Tonghao.

471
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:56,920
My name is Shan Junhao.

472
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,280
Just now during the board meeting...

473
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,400
I’m sorry.

474
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,710
I assumed you invited me here.

475
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,350
I didn’t know it’d cause you trouble.

476
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,920
I don’t know you.

477
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:18,880
Why would I do that?

478
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,310
That’s a lousy excuse.

479
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:25,040
You don’t know me?

480
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:27,640
Tonghao, what are you talking about?

481
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,830
I’ll say it again.

482
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,160
My name isn’t Tonghao.

483
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,000
It’s Shan Junhao.

484
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:37,830
I’m here to check something with you.

485
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,430
Zhang Minghan claimed that we were a couple.

486
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,260
Is it true?

487
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,470
You don’t remember?

488
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,280
I’m...

489
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,710
I’m Ye Qianyu.

490
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,280
Were we in love,

491
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:56,590
why didn’t I feel

492
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,950
any chemistry between us?

493
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,000
On the contrary,

494
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,800
all I feel is disgust.

495
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:11,350
I don’t believe.

496
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,000
Did Tonghao disappear

497
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:15,710
after you became Shan Junhao?

498
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:19,280
We went through so much together.

499
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:22,190
Whenever I needed help,

500
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,400
you were right there.

501
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,230
You really don’t remember?

502
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:29,160
When I got injured in the heavenly pit,

503
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,190
you carried me out.

504
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:34,280
You told me names of stars.

505
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:38,040
You got hurt when searching for white dolphins.

506
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,950
You went with me to my classmate party

507
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,710
and we took the Ferris wheel together.

508
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,160
You don’t remember

509
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,000
any bit of it?

510
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,760
Not at all.

511
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,830
Did Tang Shunming

512
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:05,430
ask you to seduce me

513
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,280
when I ended up in Guanmei, memoryless,

514
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:10,710
so that he could avoid paying the 8 million back?

515
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:18,400
How scheming you were!

516
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,040
What?

517
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,430
He would never do that.

518
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,520
Or what else?

519
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:32,830
You used my vulnerability

520
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,350
and made up stories about us

521
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,520
to blackmail me,

522
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:38,590
right?

523
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,110
Fine.

524
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:45,800
Name your price.

525
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:48,000
What?

526
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:50,640
Isn’t it your style?

527
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:53,680
You got me out of the water

528
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,880
and asked me to pay for your salvage,

529
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:58,470
first kiss and loss.

530
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:01,640
How much hush money

531
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,470
should I pay this time?

532
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:15,350
100,000

533
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:16,830
per word.

534
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,640
Shan Junhao and I were once in love.

535
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,520
Eight words, so 800,000 it is.

536
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,520
A good bargain

537
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,350
to protect your reputation, isn’t it?

538
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,400
Fine. Deal.

539
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,880
I’ll ask my lawyer to send you the contract.

540
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,640
Once you get paid,

541
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:46,470
you’d better keep your promise.

542
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:54,560
I might be greedy and shameless

543
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:59,160
but I’m a woman of my word.

544
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,800
Good.

545
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:28,800
Junhao.

546
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:32,640
Let’s go.

547
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,560
Qianyu.

548
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,190
Qianyu.

549
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,430
Are you alright?

550
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:41,520
Let’s go home.

551
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:02,880
You need to eat something.

552
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:11,950
That jerk Shan Junhao...

553
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,090
I want alcohol.

554
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,520
Are you sure?

555
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:24,270
Let her drink.

556
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:27,990
She’ll feel better afterwards.

557
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:36,230
Qianyu can’t drink?

558
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,830
You’ll find out later.

559
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:41,470
Mom.

560
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,560
Thanks to Ziqian,

561
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,110
we were able to turn the table.

562
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:46,880
Yes.

563
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,280
He found the key witnesses,

564
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:51,110
leading to Zhang Minghan’s suspension.

565
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:53,520
Really?

566
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:57,590
But,

567
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,520
was he really involved?

568
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,710
Mr. Qiu and Mr. Lin are his men.

569
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,800
The investigation will reveal

570
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:06,400
if he’s guilty.

571
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,430
Seeing the three of you working together

572
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:17,670
to overcome the difficulty,

573
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,390
I’m really proud.

574
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:21,950
By the way,

575
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:26,120
I heard Ye Qianyu

576
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,520
made a scene during the board meeting.

577
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:30,230
What did she want?

578
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:32,230
Money, of course.

579
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:35,150
She asked Junhao for 800,000.

580
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,230
Has she no shame?

581
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:44,630
Junhao,

582
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:46,840
tell the security

583
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,150
not to let her enter the company again.

584
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,040
Don’t worry, Mom.

585
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,360
I’ll handle it.

586
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,320
Yunyi,

587
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,320
we need a new director of development.

588
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,840
I want you to take that position.

589
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:07,120
I’ll tell HR to announce it tomorrow.

590
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:08,910
OK.

591
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,230
Congratulations! You’re promoted!

592
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,320
I want nothing else

593
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:19,760
other than the three of you.

594
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:23,520
Aunt Jiang. You seldom look so delighted lately.

595
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:25,560
Yes.

596
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,150
Since Junhao came back,

597
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:28,950
you’ve been in a much better mood, Mom.

598
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:35,630
Today is a good day.

599
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,470
Let’s drink together to celebrate.

600
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,460
Good idea.

601
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:43,280
I’ve asked Mrs. Lin to prepare a big meal.

602
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:44,470
Let’s eat.

603
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:45,360
OK.

604
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:46,800
Let’s go.

605
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,800
Cheers!

606
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,710
Drink your sorrow away.

607
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,150
Slowly, slowly.

608
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,600
Mama Jinzhi.

609
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:13,080
Will...Will she be OK?

610
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:16,150
Just let her be.

611
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,040
Tonghao,

612
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,000
you rat bastard!

613
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,230
Yes. He is.

614
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,080
Tonghao is a jerk!

615
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,470
Chen Jinzhi.

616
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:19,230
You’re so cheap and stingy.

617
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,600
You always deduct my allowance

618
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,280
and take my secret money.

619
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:28,800
I told you she can’t drink.

620
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,670
Ye Shengzhe!

621
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,630
You’re no better.

622
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:32,870
You

623
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,120
always copy adults’ words

624
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,950
and pretend to be nice.

625
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,000
You think you’re so smart, huh?

626
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,390
Yes, you are smart.

627
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,040
You’re a genius

628
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,710
but you can’t set me up all the time,

629
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:50,470
did you hear me?

630
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,040
You kept so much to yourself.

631
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:03,080
Taichu?

632
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,430
You...

633
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,430
I...

634
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,110
You’re good.

635
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:18,710
Let’s dance, OK?

636
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,000
Let’s dance.

637
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,870
- Dance around the room. - Careful.

638
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,600
- Come on. - Slowly.

639
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:28,300
Turn around.

640
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:29,310
Turn around.

641
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:32,040
Be careful.

642
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:38,760
I’m fine.

643
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,190
I’m OK.

644
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:49,910
My bad.

645
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,470
It’s my fault.

646
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,560
I forgot

647
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,430
how wild she was after getting drunk.

648
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:58,910
Hey, cabriolet guy.

649
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,520
You don’t mind that, do you?

650
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,520
I think she’s cute.

651
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:07,630
Mama Jinzhi.

652
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:08,560
She’s too drunk.

653
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:10,560
Let me bring her back to her room.

654
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,760
OK. Sure.

655
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,390
Don’t lock us up.

656
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,870
Don’t lock the door.

657
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:27,950
The lock was broken last time.

658
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,220
I want more beer.

659
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:31,150
Don’t go.

660
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,150
Don’t leave me alone.

661
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:33,870
OK?

662
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:40,170
Tonghao, don’t go.

663
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,360
Relax. I’m not going anywhere.

664
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,230
I don’t believe.

665
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,870
Did Tonghao disappear

666
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:16,150
after you became Shan Junhao?

667
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:19,670
We went through so much together.

668
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,950
Whenever I needed help,

669
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,670
you were right there.

670
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,950
You really don’t remember?

671
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,910
When I got injured in the heavenly pit,

672
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,150
you carried me out.

673
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,080
You told me names of stars.

674
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,840
You got hurt when searching for white dolphins.

675
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:41,360
You went with me to my classmate party

676
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:43,080
and we took the Ferris wheel together.

677
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,150
You don’t remember

678
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:47,040
any bit of it?

679
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,800
You’re up.

680
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:23,320
Mom.

681
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:25,020
My head hurts.

682
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:26,320
You deserve it.

683
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,230
You got yourself drunk.

684
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:30,600
And you danced like crazy.

685
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:31,760
So embarrassing!

686
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:34,560
I danced?

687
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:36,870
You didn’t do it alone.

688
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:40,190
You insisted on dancing with Taichu.

689
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:42,390
If I were him, I’d never love you.

690
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:44,190
You know what he did?

691
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:45,670
He was with you here the whole night.

692
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,080
He did?

693
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,230
He stayed the night again?

694
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:53,670
Yeah!

695
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,430
You held his arm and refused to let him go.

696
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,320
You completely lost your mind.

697
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,080
I was so embarrassed.

698
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,710
What’s worse,

699
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,760
you called him Tonghao.

700
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:12,430
Why didn’t you stop me?

701
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:13,520
How could I?

702
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:15,190
I wish I could!

703
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:17,230
So humiliating!

704
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:18,430
Most importantly,

705
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:22,040
you called me cheap and stingy.

706
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:25,430
This is not over.

707
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,230
