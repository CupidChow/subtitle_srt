12
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,310
Hello, Mr. Qin.

13
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,480
Mr. Qin,

14
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,510
this is Mr. Xu.

15
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,270
This is Mr. Qin.

16
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,190
Mr. Xu,

17
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,910
I heard quite a lot about you.

18
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,080
Glad to meet you finally.

19
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,040
Good manner.

20
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,390
Nice to meet you.

21
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,270
Nice to meet you.

22
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,440
Hi, Mr. Xu.

23
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,590
Good to see you again.

24
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,780
Um…

25
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,270
Be seated, please.

26
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:28,750
Be seated.

27
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:30,970
Please.

28
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:34,600
Mr. Xu,

29
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,190
Mr. Qin

30
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,000
is a straightforward,

31
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,470
friendly and gallant man.

32
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,110
Mr. Lin and I

33
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:43,800
used to work for Senwell,

34
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,160
but Mr. Qin

35
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,520
accepted us

36
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,680
without any prejudice.

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,550
So I think you two

38
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,800
could make good friends.

39
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,190
Right?

40
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,390
Yes, I agree.

41
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,960
In fact,

42
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:01,190
the cooperation

43
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,600
between Mr. Xu and Marv started long ago.

44
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,910
Yes, true.

45
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,550
Everyone present is my good friend.

46
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,100
Yes.

47
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,520
And good business partner.

48
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,240
- Right. - Yeah, yeah.

49
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,020
Come on.

50
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:32,630
I propose

51
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,110
we drink the first glasses to Mr. Xu.

52
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:34,910
- Good idea. - OK.

53
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,750
- Here. - To you, Mr. Xu.

54
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,160
I believe under Mr. Xu’s leadership,

55
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:42,160
Senwell will open a new chapter.

56
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,550
Mr. Xu, cheers!

57
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,750
Let’s go to Maimai Hamburger.

58
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,240
They offer two at one’s price now.

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,910
Most importantly,

60
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,190
they offer free Wi-Fi.

61
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,750
You can sit there until late in night.

62
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,630
They won’t drive you out.

63
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,110
You sing at night.

64
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,880
Why don’t you get a daytime job?

65
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,830
Singing is my job.

66
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,110
Do you think only a job with fixed working hours

67
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,240
and salary

68
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,320
is considered a job?

69
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,230
Aren’t you lack of sense of security

70
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,160
to live a life with so many uncertainties?

71
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,960
Sense of security?

72
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,950
That’s the most boring thing

73
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,040
in the world.

74
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,350
It tells you to

75
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,790
go ahead in one direction,

76
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,230
which you could foresee the end.

77
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,110
I’d rather maintain

78
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,000
my curiosity and interest in the world

79
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,200
than let the sense of security

80
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,600

I don’t know.

105
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,790
All I know is that they’re in trouble.

106
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,550
I’m worried about them.

107
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:35,920
You have to know

108
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,920
if you go to them

109
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,840
before your wound fully heals,

110
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,440
I’m not sure you can get out unharmed.

111
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,940
I can’t care that much.

112
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:45,980
Yunyi,

113
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,070
remember,

114
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,830
whatever happens,

115
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,830
live the life for yourself.

116
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,270
I believe you all

117
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,230
have a thorough knowledge about the incident.

118
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,390
What Shan Yaolong did

119
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,200
is undisputedly

120
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,240
a disgrace to Senwell.

121
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,880
But what happened happened.

122
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,350
Now we have to

123
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:18,110
open a new chapter in Senwell.

124
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,200
The office of chairman

125
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,790
is usually assumed by the director
with the most shares.

126
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,480
Yes. That’s right.

127
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,110
If you all agree,

128
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,600
let’s welcome our new chairman,

129
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,040
Xu Ziqian.

130
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,350
I believe my father would be glad

131
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,270
to see me assuming the office of chairman.

132
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,270
From now on,

133
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,480
I’ll lead you

134
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,350
and Senwell to a new era.

135
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,040
Besides,

136
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,110
do you have any suggestions

137
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,110
on the candidate of general manager?

138
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,820
We have to be serious about it.

139
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,860
It seems we need to talk about it seriously.

140
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,180
- This is important. - Yes.

141
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,320
As the chief executive officer of the group,

142
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:33,000
the GM has to possess the ability
to think in big picture,

143
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,320
a visionary and keen insight,

144
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,760
and the leadership to unite the team.

145
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:51,110
Sadly, we don’t have such a person in our group.

146
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,480
So, I decide

147
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,270
to concurrently hold the office
of general manager.

= Sealed up by Qingcheng People’s Court =

149
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,280

150
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,550
Chairman Xu,

151
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,470
why did you do that?

152
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:13,520
Has your hate

153
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,640
made you the slave of power?

154
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,550
I have no interest in power.

155
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,710
As to the reason why I made the decision,

156
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,710
I’ve made it clear at the board meeting.

157
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,710
Mr. Xu, I’ve found Director Fan.

158
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,590
Where is she?

159
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:30,110
I found her outside the Shan Residence.

160
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,640
But there’s a tiny accident.

161
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,080
She’s been sent to the hospital now.

162
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,540
= Money Bag Grocery =

163
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,840
Give me the bowls.

164
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,400
OK.

165
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,880
Aunt.

166
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,000
She actually came.

167
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,470
Aunt, this way, please.

168
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,640
Go ahead.

169
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,110
Come on, go.

170
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:32,960
Welcome!

171
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,030
Good evening, Mama Jinzhi.

172
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,440
Not quite good actually.

173
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,280
Chen!

174
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,670
Mrs. Shan,

175
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,080
welcome to our humble house.

176
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,550
Be seated, please.

177
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,910
Aunt, this way.

178
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,720
Mr. Shan, Mrs. Shan.

179
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:02,700
Mrs. Shan, over here.

180
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,900
- Here. - This way, please.

181
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,500
Please be seated.

182
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,260
Make yourself at home.

183
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:29,520
Mrs. Shan, tea, please.

184
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,150
Junhao,

185
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,470
let’s find somewhere else to stay.

186
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,230
Aunt,

187
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,760
we’ve prepared rooms for you.

188
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,440
Just in Guanmei Inn.

189
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,520
After dinner,

190
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,880
I’ll drive you there.

191
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,000
Yes, yes.

192
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,400
Tonghao is back!

193
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:54,440
Dinner is ready!

194
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:55,110
Dinner is ready!

195
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:55,880
Welcome!

196
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:57,000
So many dishes!

197
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,080
Here. Put it here.

198
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,870
OK.

199
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,070
- Make room. - Make room.

200
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:01,800
Help yourself.

201
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,490
Shrimps.

202
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,200
These dishes

203
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,880
are all to Tonghao’s appetite.

204
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,470
Tonghao,

205
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,350
you look so handsome in suit.

206
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,980
- This must be Tonghao’s mom. - Tonghao.

207
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,610
Your suit is so stylish.

208
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,160
- Aunt. - It must be expensive.

209
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,040
You must have spent

210
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:25,520
- quite a lot on it. - So beautiful.

211
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,990
- Is 150 yuan enough to buy it? - All right.

212
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,800
- I can give it to you if you like.
- Let’s have dinner.

213
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,200
Right.

214
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,020
- Let’s talk over dinner. - Dinner.

215
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:33,840
- Take a seat. - Have dinner.

216
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,490
Sit.

217
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:35,880
Yeah, we can talk over dinner.

218
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,460
Sit.

219
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,520
These dishes

220
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:39,370
are all Master’s specialties.

221
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,320
Make yourself at home.

222
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,650
- Help yourself. - Yeah, help yourself.

223
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:43,640
Let’s have dinner.

224
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:43,980
OK!

225
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,640
- All right. Dinner time! - Get started.

226
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,670
Try this!

227
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:48,270
Come on. Eat more.

228
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,130
Eat more.

229
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,910
Come on. Try this.

230
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,110
A few more.

231
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:56,470
Delicious!

232
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,400
Um…

233
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,280
If I may,

234
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:01,590
Mr. Shan,

235
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:02,230
I…

236
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,640
This is good.

237
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,640
I’m so grateful to you.

238
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,280
I didn’t expect

239
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,350
you would give Guanmei Inn back to me.

240
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,200
Listen,

241
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,440
on behalf of Guanmei Inn,

242
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,280
a toast to Tonghao.

243
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:19,960
Raise your glasses.

244
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,470
OK!

245
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,260
Glasses!

246
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,140
- Come on, guys! - Come on!

247
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,760
Our friend, Tonghao, is back!

248
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,120
And Mrs. Shan.

249
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,900
- To Mrs. Shan! - Mrs. Shan.

250
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,180
- This is to you! - Cheers!

251
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,090
Cheers!

252
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:33,440
Cheers!

253
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,320
- Have more! - This is good.

254
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,230
This one is excellent.

255
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,280
There you are.

256
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,550
Dawei, glad you come.

257
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,640
Come here. Chop, chop!

258
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,550
Come over here.

259
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,640
Are you hungry? Have you had dinner?

260
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,880
Move, move.

261
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,960
I’m here to check if Mr. and Mrs. Shan

262
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,110
have settled in.

263
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,590
Have you found Yunyi?

264
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:00,150
Not yet.

265
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,350
I’ll keep you informed.

266
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,110
Dawei, have a bite.

267
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,980
- I already had dinner. - You look thinner.

268
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,000
Really?

269
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,960
I told you that you’re welcome at any time.

270
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,780
You haven’t come for a while.

271
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,380
You’re sitting too close to me.

272
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,960
- I’m busy at work.
- So I can get food for you.

273
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,720
I don’t have much time.

274
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,880
Wait. I called.

275
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,910
Why didn’t you answer?

276
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:23,840
Make yourself at home.

277
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,710
Is this one good?

278
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:25,960
Try some shrimps.

279
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,030
Yes, it’s delicious.

280
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,150
Am I right?

281
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,180
- Have a few more. - Yummy!

282
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,420
- This one is tasty. - Help yourself.

283
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,180
Let me get some for you.

284
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,320
Make yourselves at home.

285
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,560
Help yourselves.

286
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:37,440
Come on.

287
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:37,900
Try this.

288
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,730
Here. Try this.

289
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:40,110
- Have a few more. - Have a few more.

290
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,200
Aunt,

291
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,470
do you want to use the toilet?

292
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:46,590
Let me show you.

293
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,760
On behalf of everyone here,
I’d like to say to Tonghao…

294
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,270
No, to Mr. Shan.

295
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,130
- Here. - Thank you.

296
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:00,430
Cheers!

297
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,150
We made such a feast.

298
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,110
What does she mean?

299
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,150
I don’t care if she eats or not.

300
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,710
What’s with the long face?

301
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,840
I apologize, Mama Jinzhi.

302
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,760
My mom is probably too tired.

303
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,030
She doesn’t have appetite.

304
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:15,590
Don’t be angry with her.

305
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,590
I can understand that.

306
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:22,440
After so many things happened,

307
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,280
who could have appetite or sleep well?

308
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:24,960
Join me.

309
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:25,760
One more toast.

310
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,910
Raise your glasses.

311
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,030
- Cheers! - Cheers!

312
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,110
You’re right.

313
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,700
If it were me,

314
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,160
I’d have been crushed.

315
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,590
All right. Let’s have dinner.

316
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,790
Tonghao, here is to you.

317
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:51,520
The patient collapsed

318
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,910
due to hypoglycemia.

319
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,080
She needs to take some rest and nutrition.

320
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:55,790
She can go home.

321
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,200
What about her eyes?

322
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,000
Her eyes have been cured for a while.

323
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,760
Don’t worry about that.

324
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:01,790
Are you saying

325
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:03,670
that her eyes have recovered long time ago?

326
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,640
Yes.

327
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,470
The clot pressuring her optic nerve

328
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,610
dissolved long before.

329
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,150
There’s no further sequela.

330
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,890
But you need to pay attention

331
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,510
that the patient is depressed

332
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,840
and has little appetite and trouble with sleep,

333
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,020
probably caused by mental stress.

334
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:17,870
I suggest

335
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,520
you take her to see a psychologist.

336
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,410
Sometimes,

337
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:22,240
comfort from family and friends
isn’t professional,

338
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,880
hence can’t produce the result you want.

339
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,400
OK, I see, doctor.

340
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,110
Thank you.

341
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,520
Yunyi.

342
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:02,710
You’re awake.

343
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:03,470
Ziqian,

344
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,230
how are Junhao and Mom?

345
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,110
Where are they?

346
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,950
They went to Guanmei.

347
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:17,040
Let’s go to them.

348
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:19,430
They’re alright.

349
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,920
The doctor said

350
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,190
you need to stay in bed

351
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:23,590
and rest.

352
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,760
Is it true

353
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:34,520
about the incident?

354
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:37,110
Did Dad really…

355
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:40,470
Yunyi, put it out of your mind.

356
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,040
Where have you been?

357
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,800
I looked for you for long.

358
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,280
I…

359
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:54,960
Never mind.

360
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,350
Put these things aside

361
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,640
and have some rest,

362
00:17:58,830 --> 00:17:59,470
OK?

363
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,000
Mom, how do you like this place?

364
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,800
Quite normal.

365
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:32,430
Aunt,

366
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,310
you have trouble with sleep recently.

367
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,070
Chen made some soup that helps sleep.

368
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,190
It works.

369
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,000
Take it

370
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,680
and I guarantee you’ll have a good sleep.

371
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,350
I don’t have appetite.

372
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,590
I’m thirsty. I’ll have a bowl.

373
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,160
Tastes good.

374
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:02,760
Give the other to me.

375
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:17,400
Aunt, do you like this room?

376
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,520
Tonghao designed it.

377
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,430
The view is great.

378
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,110
It’s OK.

379
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,950
I’m tired. I want to go to bed.

380
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,760
OK, good night.

381
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,040
Call me if you need anything.

382
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,590
I’ll leave you.

383
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,680
Mom, sweet dreams.

384
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:43,350
I’ll see you tomorrow.

385
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:06,880
Sorry, Qianyu.

386
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,430
My mom is upset recently.

387
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,470
I apologize.

388
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:14,070
It doesn’t matter.

389
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,590
So many things happened lately.

390
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,430
Aunt must be depressed.

391
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,190
Don’t frown.

392
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,760
Your luck will slip away.

393
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,590
Then let me…

394
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,430
Give you a hug.

395
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:48,470
What are you doing?

396
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:49,830
As long as you’re in my arms,

397
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,230
I can keep my luck.

398
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,470
Put me down.

399
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:53,880
No!

400
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:55,760
If I did,

401
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,800
my luck would run away.

402
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,640
I need to go home.

403
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:00,520
I’ll send you home.

404
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,070
Put me down.

405
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,880
Come on. Let me carry you home.

406
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,350
Let me down! Now!

407
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:08,110
Let me send you home!

408
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,520
Put me down.

409
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,230
Hold on tight!

410
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,430
We’re going home!

411
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,000
Put me down.

412
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:13,620
No.

413
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,530
Put me down. I can walk myself.

414
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:17,230
No, I won’t put you down.

415
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:19,100
Hold tight. Let’s go home.

416
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,250
Put me down.

417
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,950
No.

418
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,560
Put me down!

419
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,880
No way! Let’s go!

420
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,070
Put me down.

421
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,800
Daisy was just like

422
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,070
myself when I was little,

423
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,280
abandoned on street,

424
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,040
so poor.

425
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,160
So I took her home.

426
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:48,280
But I couldn’t take care of her myself.

427
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,000
Gladly you took her in

428
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,280
so she can be so happy.

429
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,640
I can take care of Daisy

430
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:58,880
and I can take care of you.

431
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,230
Ziqian,

432
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:02,800
I’m sorry

433
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,640
to have made you worried.

434
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:07,880
It’s OK.

435
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,590
What matters is that you’re back.

436
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,430
However,

437
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,590
our home is gone.

438
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,070
In fact,

439
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,680
I didn’t have home in the first place.

440
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,950
Yunyi,

441
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,040
this is your home.

442
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:35,000
You can rely on me,

443
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,950
forever on me.

444
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:45,920
Ziqian,

445
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,230
Mom and Junhao…

446
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,070
Don’t bring them up.

447
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:55,040
Shan Yaolong killed my parents.

448
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,680
He almost killed me, too.

449
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,920
Junhao had everything

450
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,560
but he hurt you more than once.

451
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,040
Without them,

452
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,800
we could have had a better life.

453
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,830
Yunyi,

454
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:19,000
promise me.

455
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:21,470
Put everything behind you

456
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,920
and have a good rest.

457
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,040
OK?

458
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,110
Come in.

459
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,560
Aunt Jiang,

460
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,800
Chen made you breakfast.

461
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,830
Please have some.

462
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,830
I don’t have appetite.

463
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,110
Your body couldn’t possibly put up with it.

464
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:01,280
Chen made these dishes by herself.

465
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,040
They’re all delicious.

466
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,230
Ye Qianyu,

467
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:10,230
you shouldn’t have come into Junhao’s life.

468
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:12,920
Because of you,

469
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,880
Yunyi left us.

470
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:17,800
I’m sorry, aunt.

471
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,350
I didn’t know it would end up like this.

472
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,230
I’ll help you find her.

473
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,190
If anything happens to Yunyi,

474
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,520
I will never forgive you.

475
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:39,680
I’m sorry.

476
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,760
Have some breakfast.

477
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,710
I’ll leave you.

478
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,470
Qianyu.

479
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:11,820
Morning.

480
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:13,000
Morning.

481
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:20,760
What’s up?

482
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,590
Nothing.

483
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,040
I didn’t sleep well last night.

484
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,310
My shoulders are sore.

485
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,160
Come. Let me give you a massage.

486
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,310
Mama Jinzhi is so considerate.

487
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,400
Have breakfast.

488
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,560
Let me give you a massage.

489
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,590
I’m OK. Have your breakfast.

490
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,760
Take a seat.

491
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:01,830
Now.

492
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,110
Eat while it’s warm.

493
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,430
Aren’t you going to have some?

494
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:10,230
I already had.

495
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:13,880
Try this.

496
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,110
Chen made it herself.

497
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,310
Nice!

498
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,950
A few more bites.

499
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,680
You’re awake. Morning.

500
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:11,350
Morning.

501
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,350
Daisy.

502
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,160
Breakfast time.

503
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,830
Easy.

504
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,110
What are you waiting for?

505
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:25,560
Let’s have breakfast.

506
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:41,520
Ziqian,

507
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,470
I didn’t know it can be so cozy on your own.

508
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,520
It’s just good for today.

509
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:50,470
It’s the first time I feel

510
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,310
this house is home.

511
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,680
Why?

512
00:27:58,430 --> 00:27:59,470
Because you’re here.

513
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,000
Ziqian,

514
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,400
I don’t deserve you being so good to me.

515
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,830
Only I, myself,

516
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:17,590
know if you deserve or not.

517
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:25,590
Have some breakfast.

518
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,590
The doctor said it was malnutrition.

519
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,430
Come in.

520
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,070
Mom.

521
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,680
Junhao.

522
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,830
Aunt, do you like the breakfast?

523
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,000
It’s OK.

524
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,230
Mom,

525
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,160
let’s take a stroll outside.

526
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,920
The air here is fresh.

527
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,190
I’m good.

528
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,400
Any news of Yunyi?

529
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,040
Not yet.

530
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,920
I’m going to look for her.

531
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,710
Let me go with you.

532
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:20,950
No need.

533
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,070
Go back to your own business.

534
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,350
Mom,

535
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,680
Qianyu meant to be kind.

536
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,830
Don’t be so aggressive to her.

537
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:58,560
Before Yunyi comes back,

538
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,590
I can’t possibly accept her.

539
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:11,830
Yunyi,

540
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:13,680
do you want to take a walk?

541
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:15,560
Let’s buy some clothes

542
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,280
and some food ingredients.

543
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:18,880
I’m good.

544
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:21,430
Don’t you need to go to work?

545
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,230
It’s OK.

546
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,470
I’ve arranged everything in the company.

547
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,190
Yunyi.

548
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,310
Yunyi.

549
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,280
Jinzhi,

550
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,280
you’ve given up on Taichu so soon?

551
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:11,640
Shan Junhao lost everything.

552
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:14,800
And you made soup that helps sleep

553
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,430
and breakfast for his mom.

554
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:19,760
You never made such a bad deal.

555
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,760
It’s not a deal.

556
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:24,520
Is my daughter’s love a deal?

557
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:27,190
Qianyu chose Shan Junhao.

558
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,260
I can’t force her to love Taichu.

559
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,310
Right.

560
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:32,520
Fengqiao,

561
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,470
do you know what you’re saying?

562
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:38,830
Jinzhi,

563
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:41,560
I know you’ll support Qianyu.

564
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:47,350
Qianyu is my daughter.

565
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:49,000
Of course she has my support.

566
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:50,830
Excellent!

567
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,430
No one competes with me on Taichu now.

568
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,590
Taichu?

569
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,830
What are you talking about?

570
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,590
Nothing.

571
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:05,310
No appetite?

572
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,310
She ate them all.

573
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,400
You made the breakfast.

574
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,310
The most tempting breakfast of the world.

575
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:14,400
Right.

576
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,430
Look,

577
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:17,590
you sent the breakfast over in early morning.

578
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,470
But you haven’t had any yet.

579
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,400
Hey,

580
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,950
let’s go home and have breakfast.

581
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,710
I’m starving.

582
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,040
I told you to have breakfast first.

583
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,520
You refused and had to come with me.

584
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,680
I just wanted to seize every opportunity

585
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,710
to spend more time with you.

586
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:38,310
Let’s go.

587
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:40,640
OK.

588
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,110
I want to be in love, too.

589
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:57,500
= Money Bag Grocery =

590
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:23,110
Director Fan,

591
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:25,110
why did you come here?

592
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,710
Mr. Tang,

593
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:34,470
I heard my mom and Junhao are here.

594
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:36,310
I want to see them.

595
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,470
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

596
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:38,920
They both live here,

597
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,230
in Guanmei Inn.

598
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,070
Due to your being missing lately,

599
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:44,800
Mrs. Shan is terribly concerned.

600
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:47,950
Oh, right. I need to tell them right now.

601
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:50,280
Yes. Please wait a moment.

602
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:21,430
Yunyi!

603
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,800
Mom.

604
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,470
Darling.

605
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,120
I’m sorry.

606
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,150
As long as you’re back.

607
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:39,560
That’s all I ask for.

608
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:46,470
Let me see if you’re OK.

609
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,320
Don’t cry.

610
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:53,600
Let’s not cry.

611
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,120
We should be happy. Cheer up.

612
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:57,910
I’m OK, Mom.

613
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:00,230
Come in. Let’s talk inside.

614
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,430
Director Fan.

615
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,910
Where have you been?

616
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,670
Why didn’t you call us for so long?

617
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,600
Junhao and I were worried about you.

618
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,710
Mom, where is Junhao?

619
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,560
He’s out looking for you.

620
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,190
I’ve told him

621
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:40,870
to come back as soon as possible.

622
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:43,670
Junhao is worried about me, isn’t he?

623
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:45,320
Of course he is.

624
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:46,910
He’s worried about you

625
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,190
and looks for you every day.

626
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:51,000
He’s searched every place

627
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,390
you could possibly go.

628
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:56,190
Darling,

629
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,950
don’t ever run away.

630
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,430
Mom missed you.

631
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:05,950
Mom.

632
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,470
I’m sorry.

633
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,870
I… I just

634
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:13,390
don’t know what to do. Mom.

635
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:14,840
Don’t say sorry.

636
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:16,910
It’s not your fault.

637
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:18,560
It’s not your fault at all.

638
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:22,040
It’s my fault.

639
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,670
Mom wanted you

640
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:27,000
to be my daughter-in-law.

641
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:28,230
Who knows

642
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,150
it hurt you so much?

643
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:32,120
It’s OK, Mom.

644
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,910
I’m sorry for that.

645
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,080
Mom.

646
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:37,430
Mom.

647
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,600
Mom.

648
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,710
Now you’re back.

649
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:48,630
Nothing is more important

650
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:51,390
than a reunion of our family.

651
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,120
Boss,

652
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:57,630
Fan Yunyi is back now.

653
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,710
Will she and Tonghao

654
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:01,360
get back together?

655
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,360
When she passed the front desk,

656
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,320
I could feel the hostility in her.

657
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,560
Really?

658
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:12,910
Qianyu did screw up her marriage.

659
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:15,670
She has every reason to hate Qianyu.

660
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,560
Nonsense!

661
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:20,000
Qianyu… Qianyu saved Tonghao.

662
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,560
What do you mean “screw up”?

663
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,670
No, no, no.

664
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:23,470
Listen to me.

665
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,430
I heard she’s…

666
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,870
Stop the gossip. It won’t kill you.

667
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:33,800
- OK. - OK.

668
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:38,390
Master,

669
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:39,470
Director Fan is here.

670
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:41,230
Make some of your specialties for them.

671
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:45,840
Qianyu,

672
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:47,600
Yunyi is back, right?

673
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,430
Where is she?

674
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:50,430
She’s chatting with Aunt Jiang on the balcony.

675
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,840
Help me take this…

676
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:02,080
Qianyu,

677
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,320
your mom isn’t home today.

678
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:05,040
I need to go back to the store.

679
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:06,120
OK.

680
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:07,120
See you.

681
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,940
- Bye-bye, boss. - Bye-bye, boss.

682
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:25,080
Fengqiao,

683
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,950
what’s going on here?

684
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,430
I have no idea.

685
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,910
As far as I can see,

686
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:33,190
maybe Xu Ziqian

687
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,390
likes Miss Fan upstairs.

688
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:39,520
But Miss Fan doesn’t like Xu Ziqian

689
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,560
but Shan Junhao.

690
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,320
But Shan Junhao likes Ye Qianyu.

691
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:47,840
Ye Qianyu likes Tonghao.

692
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,470
You’re right.

693
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,320
You’re so stupid.

694
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:00,470
Yunyi!

695
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:01,950
Junhao is back.

696
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,390
Junhao.

697
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,950
Yunyi, is everything alright?

698
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,120
Yes.

699
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,360
How do you know we’re here?

700
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:19,320
Ziqian told me about it.

701
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:22,760
Ziqian found you?

702
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:24,280
No.

703
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,150
I learned from news that Senwell was in trouble.

704
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,190
So I came back.

705
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,910
Junhao, what happened?

706
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,190
It’s all gone now.

707
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,600
I just hope you’re fine.

708
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,280
What are you and Mom going to do?

709
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:52,840
We’ll stay in Guanmei for a while.

710
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:56,150
In the meantime, I’ll find a job.

711
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:57,870
I think I can provide for us.

712
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:01,190
Are you going to stay in Guanmei?

713
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:07,190
Is it because of Ye Qianyu?

714
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,150
I made scented tea.

715
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:29,600
Talk over a cup of tea.

716
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,280
And I asked Master to prepare lunch.

717
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,800
You can have lunch in half an hour.

718
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:35,670
Don’t pretend to be nice.

719
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,630
- Mr.…- Mr.…

720
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:06,840
Qianyu,

721
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,560
give us a minute.

722
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:17,040
You’re together.

723
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,360
You ruined my marriage

724
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,870
and my life.

725
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:35,560
After hurting me mercilessly,

726
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,080
you two got together?

727
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,190
So unperturbedly?

728
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:43,910
Junhao,

729
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,560
how could you do that to me?

730
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:48,600
How could you?

731
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,230
Yunyi.

732
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:50,220
Why?

733
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:52,140
- Why did you do that to me?
- Yunyi, don’t.

734
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,390
Mom is here. I’m on your side.

735
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,360
Yunyi.

736
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,040
Ziqian.

737
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,320
- Ziqian. - Why?

738
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,960
- Why? - Yunyi, let’s go.

739
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:17,000
- Ziqian. - Ziqian.

740
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,080
Where are you taking her?

741
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:23,600
What does it have to do with you?

742
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,840
We’re all Yunyi’s family.

743
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:34,280
Family?

744
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:38,670
How dare you say the word to me?

745
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,910
When Yunyi came back,

746
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:43,230
the first people she wanted to see
are you and Aunt Jiang.

747
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:47,040
She was so worried that she couldn’t eat

748
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:48,470
or sleep.

749
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,630
I tried to persuade her,

750
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,280
but she still ran away and came to you.

751
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:55,800
But what about you?

752
00:42:58,170 --> 00:42:59,160
What did you do?

753
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,360
You hurt her feelings again.

754
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:04,560
Don’t you know why she ran away?

755
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:09,230
Junhao,

756
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:11,430
listen carefully.

757
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:14,230
You’ve ruined her marriage.

758
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,800
I won’t allow you

759
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,320
to ruin her life.

760
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:24,860
Ziqian.

761
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,560
You can take her away.

762
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:31,150
I believe you can take good care of her.

763
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:33,760
But you have to promise me.

764
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,950
Don’t bring your hatred to her.

765
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,840
I know how to look after her.

766
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:46,080
No need to tell me what to do.

767
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:50,440
Yunyi.

768
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,200
Ziqian.

769
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:07,720
Mom,

770
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:09,670
don’t be upset.

771
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:12,670
At least, Yunyi is back.

772
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,150
Ziqian will look after her.

773
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:25,760
If Yunyi can’t come around,

774
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:28,360
you and Qianyu

775
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:30,870
won’t have our blessings.

776
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,630
Yes, we don’t let others run our lives.

777
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:38,320
But at least, we should live up to our conscience.

778
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:42,520
Think about it.

779
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:31,800
Qianyu,

780
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,950
I’ll deal with these matters.

781
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:37,950
