Shengzhe, don’t you think it’s odd?

12

Tomorrow is Saturday,

13
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,910
yet Qianyu said she has to work.

14
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,800
She seldom covered

15
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,160
others’ shifts on weekends.

16
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,400
What’s more,

17
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,120
Taichu called

18
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,360
and told me

19
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,800
she couldn’t go home this weekend.

20
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,360
How is that odd?

21
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,110
They want to be alone.

22
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,800
Should I go check on them?

23
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,960
Do you know where Taichu lives?

24
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,390
I don’t.

25
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,030
Chen.

26
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,190
Go easy on the salt!

27
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,390
Why did you put so much?

28
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:37,520
Did I?

29
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,830
Chen,

30
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,440
why did you add so much water?

31
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,720
Isn’t it too salty?

32
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,080
I’m changing this dish

33
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,110
to tomato and egg soup.

34
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,000
With more water,

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,520
we’ll have enough to eat tomorrow.

36
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:04,000
The clot in her brain is starting to dissolve.

37
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,360
Surgery is unnecessary for now.

38
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,280
Given the speed of her recovery,

39
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,950
she’ll regain her vision soon.

40
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:13,750
Thank you, doctor.

41
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,600
You’re welcome.

42
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:24,800
Yunyi,

43
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,470
tell me

44
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,030
what exactly happened.

45
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,960
Did someone push you on purpose?

46
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:38,960
Mom,

47
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,360
Ye Qianyu has explained it.

48
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,600
I only trust Yunyi’s words.

49
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,910
Mom, the floor was slippery.

50
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,960
I fell by accident.

51
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,520
Have a good rest.

52
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,470
Meanwhile,

53
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,470
I’ll prepare the wedding for you.

54
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,720
But...

55
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,670
It’s OK

56
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:06,630
even if you can’t see.

57
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,270
The wedding will be held as scheduled.

58
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,630
Don’t worry.

59
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:15,030
I’ll go home and make you some soup.

60
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,720
Junhao will be here with you.

61
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,320
Junhao,

62
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,350
can you give me my bag?

63
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,510
Tell me what you need. I’ll get it.

64
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,040
Open it.

65
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:30,110
After you came back from Guanmei,

66
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,510
I found it in your pocket.

67
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,790
I kept it

68
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,600
because I wanted you to know

69
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,510
that I could forgive you

70
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,880
despite this unexpected incident.

71
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:49,830
Yunyi...

72
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,480
Since we were little,

73
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,950
you’ve been my sun

74
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,950
and my hope.

75
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,270
I tried so hard to be good enough for you

76
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,950
and to be able to stand next to you

77
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,320
to show my best side

78
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,950
to you.

79
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,720
But...

80
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,110
to you,

81
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,550
all my effort seems to be meaningless.

82
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,790
You mistook a false encounter

83
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,760
as fate.

84
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,600
That was on the spur of the moment.

85
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,230
How long

86
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,760
have you known Ye Qianyu?

87
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,510
You’re only curious about her.

88
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,550
That’s not love.

89
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,640
Yunyi.

90
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:51,550
I know how I feel about Ye Qianyu.

91
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,200
Junhao,

92
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,200
I won’t let you go.

93
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,040
You should also think again.

94
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,350
Director Xu,

95
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,200
I’m surprised

96
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,640
that you asked to see me

97
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,000
in the middle of nowhere.

98
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,880
I believe you have a good reason for it.

99
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,830
Hope you can be smarter this time

100
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,350
and don’t put your own head on the chopping block.

101
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:34,670
Isn’t she that attendant

102
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:35,640
in Senwell Hotel?

103
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,590
Yes,

104
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,320
but she’s more than that.

105
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:45,150
So she’s that village girl I’ve heard rumors of!

106
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:48,400
No wonder Shan Junhao beat me.

107
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,520
But...

108
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,150
Why did you give me these?

109
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,640
This is her personal information.

110
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,670
Do I need to teach you how to write the story?

111
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,440
Of course not.

112
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:07,000
I make a living by that.

113
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,790
It’s juicy.

114
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,080
A huge bomb!

115
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,150
I get it.

116
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:23,910
You’re doing this

117
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,080
for Fan Yunyi, aren’t you?

118
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,110
I heard

119
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,880
things are complicated among you three.

120
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,350
I bet

121
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:35,200
there must be a love triangle.

Chief Xie.

123
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,230
I believe you won’t be so dumb

124
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,760
and write things you shouldn’t have in the story.

125
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,200
Of course not.

126
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,080
I have professional ethics.

00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,790
Are you OK?

193
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:57,670
I’m fine.

194
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,400
I’m sorry

195
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,030
that I caused you so much trouble.

196
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:06,320
I should be the one to apologize.

197
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,280
This matter has a huge impact

198
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,200
on Senwell, too.

199
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,030
I’ll tell everyone

200
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,400
it’s a misunderstanding.

201
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,670
It’s not.

202
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,230
No matter what others think,

203
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,440
I won’t give you up.

204
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,710
Don’t check your phone

205
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,670
or go out.

206
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,030
I’ll fix it.

207
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,550
I don’t know anything!

208
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,760
Are you deaf or not?

209
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:36,780
Go away!

210
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,170
- Tell us the truth. - Where’s Ye Qianyu?

211
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:39,120
What the hell do you want?

212
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,200
Where’s Ye Qianyu?

213
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,840
I don’t know anything!

214
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,080
Tell us more. Explain the whole thing.

215
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:45,960
Go away! Leave!

216
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:46,810
How are you?

217
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:47,600
Are you OK?

218
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,300
We’re fine.

219
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,640
Are you with them, too?

220
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,200
Who are you?

221
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,480
- Leave us alone! - Leave!

222
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,070
- Get out of here! - Get the hell out!

223
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,030
Why are you helping her?

224
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,150
What’s your relationship with Ye Qianyu?

225
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,280
- Say something. - Explain it to us.

226
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,200
Stop! Follow me.

227
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,200
Come with me!

228
00:13:59,260 --> 00:13:59,980
Leave us alone!

229
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,590
- Stop following us! - Get in!

230
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:03,960
Let’s go!

231
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,570
Get in the car.

232
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,860
- Step back! Move! - Let’s go.

233
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,030
Hurry up!

234
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,720
- Don’t leave! - Come back!

235
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:14,710
Why aren’t they back yet?

236
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:15,520
- Yeah. - I know.

237
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,550
What’s taking them so long?

238
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,960
Are you alright, Aunt Jinzhi?

239
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,640
Yeah. How could this happen?

240
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,350
We saw it on the news.

241
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,760
Where’s Qianyu?

242
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,640
She’s with Taichu.

243
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,670
Aunt Jinzhi,

244
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,710
when boss saw reporters heading to your store,

245
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,470
he left at once to save you.

246
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,150
Oh, crap!

247
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,520
I forgot to lock the cash register!

248
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,470
Don’t worry.

249
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,350
I’ll go.

250
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:56,960
Sheng,

251
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,960
arrange a room for Jinzhi to rest.

252
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,150
Fengqiao,

253
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,640
you take Shengzhe to school.

254
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,960
Don’t tell anyone

255
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,080
that Jinzhi is here.

256
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,640
If reporters come to our inn,

257
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,590
kick them all out.

258
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,080
They aren’t welcomed in Guanmei Inn.

259
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,490
- Yes. - Got it.

260
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,520
I didn’t know

261
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,960
Tang could be so manly.

262
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,740
Who is this?

263
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,490
- Do you know him? - Don’t know.

264
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,940
- Who’s this? - No idea.

265
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:37,550
Hello.

266
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,350
Excuse me, do you know Ye Qianyu?

267
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,910
Do you know her?

268
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:41,960
Sorry, don’t know.

269
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,120
You know where Ye Qianyu is?

270
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,740
Yes. Tell us.

271
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,400
You’re still here?

272
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,960
I said I don’t know.

273
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,000
Even if I did,

274
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,150
I wouldn’t tell you.

275
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,640
Stop asking me.

276
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,200
Excuse me. Sorry.

277
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,450
- Don’t leave. - Can you tell us anything?

278
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,400
Tang.

279
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,440
Where’s Mama Jinzhi?

280
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,320
In the inn.

281
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:08,230
That’s a relief.

282
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,320
Hey,

283
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,880
isn’t Qianyu at your place?

284
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,030
Why are you here?

285
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:14,790
I’ll tell you later.

286
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:15,590
Let’s go back first.

287
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,070
Sure. Let’s go.

288
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,230
Say something.

289
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:22,590
Stop asking us.

290
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:35,670
The best way to clarify the rumor

291
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,520
is to have Junhao and Yunyi marry now.

292
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,760
Aunt Jiang, what?

293
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,590
Once they get married,

294
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:45,520
the rumor will disappear itself.

295
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,200
But right now, Yunyi...

296
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,000
Nothing needs to be clarified.

297
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,110
It isn’t the time

298
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,710
to be stubborn now.

299
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,080
Don’t you know

300
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,790
how serious this matter is?

301
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:05,190
Junhao!

302
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,350
Junhao.

303
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,470
I hope you can think carefully.

304
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,800
Don’t risk Yunyi’s happiness

305
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:25,950
to cover your scandal.

306
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,760
I’ve already thought it through.

307
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:32,190
There’s no scandal between Qianyu and me.

308
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:36,000
Neither will I risk Yunyi’s happiness.

309
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,640
You’d better keep your promise.

310
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:46,760
Dawei.

311
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,920
I don’t care what you do

312
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,400
but delete all abusive comments online

313
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,800
on Ye Qianyu.

314
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,590
Yes.

315
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:58,520
Boss,

316
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,110
= YUZHU GROUP =
several partners canceled their appointments.

317
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,830
= YUZHU GROUP =
And our commercial is postponed.

318
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:06,800
What should we do?

319
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,520
Mr. Shan,

320
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,680
you’ve made the headline

321
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,190
several times lately.

322
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,000
Dawei.

323
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:23,000
Tell Publicity Department
not to issue any statement for now

324
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,590
and ask Director Xu

325
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,230
to dig up the source of the news.

326
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,190
Yes.

327
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:31,520
This matter is no longer about you

328
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,590
but concerns the entire company.

329
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:35,560
Shouldn’t you give us an explanation?

330
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,160
Mr. Zhang,

331
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,760
if you do care about Senwell,

332
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:44,430
you’d better spend more time on your work.

333
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:45,680
I’ve devoted all my time

334
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,160
to Senwell,

335
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:49,350
unlike you

336
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,190
who is the center of gossips.

337
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,400
Don’t forget

338
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:03,000
the board is still waiting for your explanation.

339
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,680
I told you

340
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,110
do not drag Ye Qianyu into this

341
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,190
at the moment.

342
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,590
I’m fine with you acting against Shan Junhao,

343
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,800
but I don’t want Senwell

344
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,560
to suffer irreversible losses.

345
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:42,880
Why didn’t you discuss it with me

346
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,310
before you took action?

347
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:45,800
Discuss it with you?

348
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,760
Why should I?

349
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:50,920
You think by doing this,

350
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,880
Fan Yunyi will be with you?

351
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,110
Do you still remember your goal?

352
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,400
Do you want

353
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,950
to get your things back or not?

354
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:00,880
Get out.

355
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,640
I have no time for you.

356
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,260
= Mr. Qiu =

357
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,210
Gosh!

358
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,110
How did this happen?

359
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,520
I don’t know the details

360
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,110
but it seems to be serious.

361
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:35,070
So I didn’t bring Qianyu back with me.

362
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:36,190
Jinzhi.

363
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,000
You and Shengzhe

364
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,310
can stay with us these days.

365
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,430
If you need anything,

366
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,950
I’ll go to your store to get it.

367
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:46,950
We didn’t do anything wrong.

368
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:49,040
Why should we hide ourselves?

369
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:50,710
Mama Jinzhi.

370
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,350
Cyber-violence is horrible.

371
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:53,520
You’d better

372
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,560
stay away from the media.

373
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,700
Shouldn’t Shan Junhao

374
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,360
respond to it?

375
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,870
What could he say?

376
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:03,870
They did date for a while.

377
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,950
I feel sorry for Qianyu.

378
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,190
What do they know?

379
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,800
No, I’ll

380
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,470
speak for Qianyu in the comments section.

381
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,040
How do you do that?

382
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,000
Teach me.

383
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,110
I’ll speak for her, too.

384
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,230
Yes, me too.

385
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,070
Mama Jinzhi, don’t worry too much.

386
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,640
I’ll protect Qianyu.

387
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,000
See?

388
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,040
Just calm down and stay here.

389
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,680
Taichu.

390
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,040
How are Chen and Shengzhe?

391
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,110
Tang let them stay in the inn.

392
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,680
It’s all my fault

393
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,230
that Chen and Shengzhe get implicated.

394
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:52,830
Don’t blame yourself.

395
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,040
They’re fine

396
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,680
but they’re worried about you.

397
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,430
Taichu.

398
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,110
I’ve been thinking

399
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,760
how things turned out like this.

400
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:16,110
Now, I have the answer.

401
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,310
Shan Junhao and I

402
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:19,110
belong to different worlds.

403
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,160
He can’t cut ties with his world,

404
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,190
yet I

405
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,040
keep causing him trouble.

406
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:31,160
You might be a trouble

407
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,590
in his world.

408
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,430
But to me,

409
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,950
you’re my whole world.

410
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,830
Leave with me.

411
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:51,560
Leaving means running away.

412
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,590
I don’t want to do that.

413
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,190
No matter how this will end,

414
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:57,760
I’ll accept it.

415
00:22:58,190 --> 00:22:59,110
Qianyu,

416
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,760
leaving doesn’t mean running away

417
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,950
but embracing a new self.

418
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,520
You’ll see different people and things,

419
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:09,760
then you’ll realize there are many things

420
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,000
that you love and care.

421
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,710
If you miss here,

422
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:16,190
you can come back anytime.

423
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,880
Leaving

424
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,000
isn’t about time and space

425
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,830
but moving on with your life.

426
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,800
Before I leave,

427
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,140
I have an important thing to do.

428
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:50,350
OK.

429
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,080
Congratulations

430
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:54,140
on your early release.

431
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:57,180
Thanks for your help, Mr. Zhang.

432
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,850
Otherwise, we couldn’t sit here together.

433
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:00,970
Yes, Mr. Zhang.

434
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,380
- Here. - Thanks for everything you did for us.

435
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,270
We’ll pay you back handsomely.

436
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:04,880
Yours.

437
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:09,590
You’re welcome.

438
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,160
Shan Junhao is merciless

439
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,560
but I’m not.

440
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,070
Mr. Zhang,

441
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:21,230
his name alone

442
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,190
gets me hot under the collar.

443
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:26,430
We ended up in jail

444
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:29,680
because of that little bastard!

445
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,560
Not only that,

446
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,920
he bought our shares at a low price.

447
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,600
Now, he’s in hot water.

448
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,030
Actually, I knew

449
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,950
his affair with Ye Qianyu
would be exposed one day,

450
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,400
but I didn’t expect

451
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,590
it’d be so explosive.

452
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:50,470
Mr. Zhang,

453
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,430
what do you think?

454
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:53,110
Isn’t our idea great?

455
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,070
Xu Ziqian and Shan Junhao

456
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,590
are officially on opposing sides.

457
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:58,640
What’s more,

458
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,070
Xu Ziqian has become one of us.

459
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:04,110
It’s not easy

460
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,400
to destroy Shan Junhao.

461
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:07,880
By the way,

462
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:09,800
you didn’t ask me out

463
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,560
only to catch up, did you?

464
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,070
You’re smart.

465
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,920
Nothing can be concealed from you.

466
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,830
We have

467
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,040
something for you today.

468
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,000
What is it?

469
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:27,040
It’s marvelous.

470
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:31,350
It can bury Shan Junhao instantly.

471
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,950
This is a copy of the equity transfer agreement

472
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:44,760
= Equity Transfer Agreement of Senwell=
between Xu Yifeng and Shan Yaolong.

473
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,230
What’s the use of it?

474
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:48,920
This is

475
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:52,760
the news report of Changfeng Yacht’s explosion.

476
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,350
Check the dates on the two files.

477
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,540
= Boat Crashed Searching for the Missing =

478
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,350
Right after Xu Yifeng sold his shares,

479
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,190
= Xu Yifeng and His Wife Died in Boat Crash =
his yacht exploded on the same day.

480
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,950
What’s the connection?

481
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,590
Think about it.

482
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:11,760
Shan Yaolong forced Xu Yifeng

483
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,040
to sign the equity transfer agreement.

484
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:15,920
On the same day,

485
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:18,190
Xu Yifeng died in the accident.

486
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:20,520
And his yacht

487
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,880
was a gift from Shan Yaolong.

488
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,710
Piece the three incidents altogether.

489
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:30,000
Isn’t it obvious?

490
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,710
Shan Yaolong gave that yacht to Xu Yifeng?

491
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,040
- Yes. - Correct.

492
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,000
Are you saying

493
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,560
the explosion isn’t an accident

494
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,110
but was planned by Shan Yaolong?

495
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,830
Exactly.

496
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:51,070
Those three incidents seem to be related

497
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,680
but the connection is still thin.

498
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:54,920
Also,

499
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,160
this time,

500
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:00,880
we’ve found a key witness

501
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,160
who can prove that

502
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,000
the explosion

503
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,110
was Shan Yaolong’s doing.

504
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,280
Have a look.

505
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,380
= Testimony =

506
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,300
= Ding Yuanxun =

507
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,280
Ding Yuanxun?

508
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:24,190
Yes. Ding Yuanxun.

509
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:43,590
Yunyi.

510
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,400
Yunyi.

511
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,560
I bought you flowers.

512
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,360
Sunflowers.

513
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,880
You like them?

514
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,000
Without the sun,

515
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,160
sunflowers will die, won’t they?

516
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,710
We’re in pain

517
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,640
most likely because we refuse to let go.

518
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:49,760
Junhao isn’t someone I can let go

519
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:52,230
but I can’t live without him.

520
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,110
Yunyi.

521
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:57,640
All these years,

522
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,230
I’ve chosen to stand behind you,

523
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:05,190
but I realized

524
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,950
my sacrifice

525
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,640
didn’t lead you to the right choice.

526
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:19,430
Now, I want you to know

527
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:22,470
I can be your sun, too.

528
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,190
I’m sorry, Ziqian.

529
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,590
I think

530
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,040
you can understand how I feel

531
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,160
because to some extent,

532
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:49,160
our experiences are similar.

533
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,470
It’s OK.

534
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,920
I’ve spent so much time on you

535
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:14,760
and I’m willing to

536
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,560
to spend more.

00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:35,430
If it’s work,

539
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,430
you should go.

540
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:41,400
No worries.

541
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:43,640
I want to stay for a few more minutes.

542
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,280
- Mr. Shan. - Shan Junhao.

543
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,800
Is your relationship with Ye Qianyu true?

544
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,640
Mr. Shan. Give us an answer.

545
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,520
Excuse me.

546
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,350
Can you explain it?

547
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:58,280
Excuse me. Make a way.

548
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,190
Mr. Shan.

549
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:01,580
Have you considered

550
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:02,510
your fiancée’s feelings?

551
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:03,600
Mr. Shan, please answer the questions.

552
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,800
Is the latest rumor true?

553
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,410
Isn’t she that village girl?

554
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:07,260
Ye Qianyu,

555
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,890
don’t you know Shan Junhao is already engaged?

556
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:09,690
Did Mr. Shan

557
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:10,830
give you the job in Senwell?

558
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:15,760
Ye Qianyu,

559
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,040
I said

560
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:20,090
- I wouldn’t... - I know

561
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,880
you wouldn’t have mercy on anyone

562
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,310
who slandered you or Senwell.

563
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,430
As the person involved,

564
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,920
I should tell you the truth.

565
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,760
When Shan Junhao lost his memory,

566
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:37,350
he did stay in Guanmei Fishing Village
for a while.

567
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,280
At that time,

568
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,000
he made friends with me

569
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:43,710
and everyone else there.

570
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:45,400
Other than friends,

571
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,680
we have no other relationships.

572
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:51,190
Shan Junhao, is what she said true?

573
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,230
I gave Ye Qianyu a job

574
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:58,280
in Senwell,

575
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,680
but she already resigned.

576
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:01,560
Please stop disturbing her life.

577
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,710
Who are you?

578
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:07,470
I’m her boyfriend-to-be.

579
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,880
I hope

580
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:11,110
she can accept me soon.

581
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:14,680
Let’s go.

582
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,860
- Mr. Shan, say something.
- Excuse me.

583
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,660
- Excuse me. No photos.
- Explain it to us.

584
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,460
No photos.

585
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,160
Qianyu!

586
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:35,520
Why did you do that?

587
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,470
Shan Junhao,

588
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:41,680
we live in different worlds.

589
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:44,190
My family runs a grocery for a living.

590
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:46,400
I only want to live a peaceful life.

591
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:47,800
I can live like Tonghao.

592
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,070
You can’t.

593
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:51,280
Your status,

594
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,680
your family,

595
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:54,190
and your career

596
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,470
are all your responsibilities.

597
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:58,590
They’re too heavy for me.

598
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,590
We’re done.

599
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:08,400
The past is the past.

600
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:22,830
If you want the best for Qianyu,

601
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,310
just let her go.

602
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:26,310
You can’t imagine how much she has to sacrifice

603
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,520
if she wants to be with you.

604
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,800
Standing by your side

605
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,800
is just controversial enough.

606
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,590
Is that what you want to see?

607
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:35,070
Or can you control it?

608
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:37,590
You really think

609
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:39,000
you can make her happy?

610
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:43,000
It’s between Qianyu and me.

611
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,680
Stay out of it.

612
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,950
It’s also between her and me.

613
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:49,830
I don’t want her

614
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:50,950
to live in bias and criticism.

615
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:53,760
She deserves happiness

616
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,560
and freedom.

617
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,000
I can give her both.

618
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,040
Yes.

619
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:04,470
I know you can abandon Senwell,

620
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:05,160
Fan Yunyi

621
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,800
and everything for Qianyu,

622
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:08,320
but have you considered

623
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,390
that your love

624
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:10,910
can also be a burden?

625
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,360
You’ll make her a public enemy.

626
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:20,950
Qianyu has quitted her job

627
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,630
and I’ve handed in my resignation letter to GQ.

628
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,870
We’ll soon leave the country.

629
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,390
Let her go, Shan Junhao.

630
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,320
Yunyi.

631
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,760
Your wedding gown is ready.

632
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,520
You’ll be the prettiest bride.

633
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,430
But

634
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,560
Junhao hasn’t agreed to marry me.

635
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:08,360
Come in.

636
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,190
What are you doing here?

637
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:17,150
I’m here to check on Director Fan.

638
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,150
Is it Ye Qianyu?

639
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:23,710
Get out.

640
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:25,280
I don’t want to see you.

641
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,390
Mom.

642
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:47,390
Director Fan,

643
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:50,870
thank you for your help lately.

644
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:53,390
I’m sorry

645
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,230
that I hurt you

646
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:58,410
and damaged the company.

647
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,560
So,

648
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,190
I’ve decided to leave Senwell

649
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,670
and get out of your life.

650
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,680
Wish you and Mr. Shan all the best.

651
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,950
She brought the bracelet back.

652
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:47,820
Let’s go.

653
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:15,760
What?

654
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:18,040
You’re leaving for real?

655
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:24,080
Mama Jinzhi,

656
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:26,150
Qianyu needs to go to a new place.

657
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:29,630
Ye Qianyu,

658
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,040
bring me with you.

659
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,520
My relationship failed, too.

660
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,430
Your relationship?

661
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:36,760
Your sister only had one.

662
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,150
Qianyu,

663
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:45,870
are you sure about it?

664
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,080
I’ve made up my mind.

665
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,570
OK.

666
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:03,360
Please take care of her, Taichu.

667
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,150
I will, Mama Jinzhi.

668
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,620
= Xie Quan =

669
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,430
Director Xu.

670
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:35,470
So,

671
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,390
are you satisfied

672
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,470
with my work?

673
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,840
Shan Junhao is doomed.

674
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:41,600
Do you think...

675
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:55,600
Why didn’t you pick up your phone?

676
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,600
I was looking for you all night.

677
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,040
Is this your place?

678
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,000
You can’t barge in like this.

679
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:12,230
Stop drinking.

680
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:24,320
Mr. Qiu and Mr. Lin found

681
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,470
Shan Yaolong’s most trusted assistant,

682
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,000
Ding Yuanxun.

683
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:29,080
He can prove that Shan Yaolong

684
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,470
gave that yacht to your father.

685
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:33,230
And the explosion isn’t an accident.

686
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,360
Shan Yaolong did it.

687
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,560
This is a copy

688
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,280
of the equity transfer agreement your dad signed

689
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,950
and the news about the explosion.

690
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:58,040
They happened on the same day.

691
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,150
Your dad died right after he signed the paper.

692
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,950
Shan Yaolong was ruthless.

693
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:08,000
He killed your father

694
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:09,560
for the shares.

00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,820

Ziqian,

699
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,630
I know it’s a lot to bear,

700
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:33,230
but you need to stay strong.

701
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:42,420

And this...

704
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,150
is Ding Yuanxun’s address.

705
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:02,910
You must go see him yourself.

707

The Shans are brutal.

708
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,430
You have to make them pay.

709
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,950
Ziqian.

710
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,390
I’ll go with you.

711
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:27,470
No need.

712
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,630
It’s my own business.

713
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:32,800
Ziqian!

714
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,320
Since the day I adopted Yunyi,

715
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:42,080
I’ve raised her

716
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:42,910
as your future wife.

717
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:46,190
She’s never disappointed me.

718
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,520
She’s your perfect partner

719
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,360
either at home or at work.

720
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:54,950
Did you ask what she wants?

721
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,150
I know what she wants.

722
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,910
Marrying you is her dream.

723
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:03,080
Can people get married without love

724
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,230
as long as their conditions match?

725
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:10,360
Son,

726
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,280
marriage isn’t all about love.

727
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,120
After a few years,

728
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:19,120
love will become family affection.

729
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,600
What you need

730
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,120
is the one who can stand next to you,

731
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,800
go through thick and thin with you

732
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,150
and can help you.

733
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,150
Ye Qianyu can’t do that.

734
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,630
Even if you’re together now,

735
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:33,560
your happiness won’t last long.

736
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:43,800
That’s only what you think.

737
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:46,870
I’m going to bed.

738
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:01,000
Although I wasn’t in jail,

739
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,600
over the past years,

740
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:08,840
I’ve already been punished!

741
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:10,950
Look at me.

742
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:13,630
Look what kind of life I’m living!

743
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:16,760
I wish

744
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:19,150
I were dead.

745
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:24,910
You deserve it.

746
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,150
What were my parents like?

747
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:43,160
Your...

748
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,350
Your parents

749
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,710
were the nicest people I’ve ever seen.

750
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:56,840
They were always kind.

751
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,670
They treated the staff

752
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:02,360
like family.

753
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:06,870
Back then,

754
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:09,560
your father,

755
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:13,560
Shan Yaolong and Zhang Fengxi

756
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:16,670
founded Senwell together.

757
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:19,950
At first,

758
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:22,600
they were close.

759
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:25,320
But then,

760
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,470
with the expansion

761
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:30,840
of the company,

762
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:33,190
disagreements grew

763
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,760
between your father and Shan Yaolong.

764
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:39,360
The failed investment in Dongdao Finance

765
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,360
gave Shan Yaolong a chance.

766
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:45,120
Zhang Fengxi

767
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:48,950
was soft and sophisticated.

768
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,080
In order to protect himself,

769
00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:53,470
he sided with Shan Yaolong.

770
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:58,120
He agreed that your dad shouldn’t be in charge

771
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,840
because he was unambitious and indecisive.

772
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,150
He hindered the development of the company.

773
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:09,980
Your father

774
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,080
refused to quit,

775
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:19,910
so Shan Yaolong took away his shares

776
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,800
in the name of raising funds

777
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,670
to save Senwell.

778
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,120
Then he gave your dad a yacht

779
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:29,840
and bombed it

780
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:31,600
to kill him

781
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,760
so that he can end things once and for all.

782
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:35,950
After that,

783
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:42,430
Shan Yaolong paid me to leave

784
00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:47,520
and bury that secret forever.

785
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,280
I will take revenge

786
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:58,000
