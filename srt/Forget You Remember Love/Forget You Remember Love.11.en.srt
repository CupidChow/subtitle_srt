11
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,520
Hey. Where would you like to have fun?

12
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,680
Eat or go to the seaside?

13
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,040
Eat, of course.

14
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,000
Tonghao.

15
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,400
Come here.

16
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,800
What’s up?

17
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,920
It comes to me that

18
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,600
you look like someone.

19
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,400
Who?

20
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,840
This guy looks like you. Right?

21
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,360
Yes, kind of.

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,880
Who is it?

23
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,120
It’s billionaire Shan Junhao,

24
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,960
the former general manager of Senwell.

25
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,055
He is said

26
00:02:21,055 --> 00:02:22,520
to be a commercial genius.

27
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,920
He became the general manager at a young age.

28
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,320
Besides,

29
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,600
he was mysterious and low-profile.

30
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,360
He seldom attends

31
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,640
the interviews from any media.

32
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,200
This photo

33
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,520
was taken by a gossip reporter

34
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,400
with great difficulty.

35
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,840
Show me today’s

36
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,360
housing registration form.

37
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,000
OK.

38
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,240
Senwell?

39
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,880
Isn’t Senwell’s general manager Zhang Minghan?

40
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,240
Shan Junhao was the former one.

41
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,760
It’s said he went abroad to further his studies.

42
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,200
That’s why Zhang Minghan replaced his position.

43
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,120
He’s so handsome in this photo.

44
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,360
Although his face isn’t clear,

45
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,000
I can still

46
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,760
feel his noble temperament all over

47
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,520
through the screen.

48
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,720
Can you feel it?

49
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,400
So charming.

50
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,360
Tonghao.

51
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,120
Come out with me.

52
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,000
I have a business for you.

53
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,200
What is it?

54
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,760
Do me a favor

55
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,440
to offset half of the money you owe me.

56
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,040
It’s a good deal, isn’t it?

57
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,560
What’s the favor?

58
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,240
Go to my classmate party with me.

59
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,120
Taichu can’t go,

60
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,320
so you want me be his substitute?

61
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,000
Only you can help me.

62
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,680
I am not a rich man.

63
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,320
What’s my identity for the party?

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,760
My boyfriend.

65
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,960
Your boyfriend?

66
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,320
Why not let someone else be your boyfriend?

67
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,000
There are few men in Guanmei Fishing Village.

68
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,480
You want Sheng to play my boyfriend?

69
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,480
Sheng likes Su Liyin.

70
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,960
I can’t do that.

71
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,520
You are born with extraordinary temperament.

72
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,520
Handsome and sunny.

73
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,520
Who else can be my boyfriend

74
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,600
if not you?

75
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,880
If you say so,

76
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,520
I may consider it.

77
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,720
Really?

78
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,840
You are close to Taichu.

79
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,880
It’s convenient to disguise as him.

80
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,200
Disguise as Taichu?

81
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,120
What do you mean?

82
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,000
I told Dai Anfen

83
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,680
I have a rich boyfriend.

84
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:46,880
So...

85
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,560
So you need to disguise as Taichu.

86
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,720
Qianyu.

87
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,680
You are so vainglorious.

88
00:04:57,725 --> 00:04:59,320
I am not.

89
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,760
Dai Anfen and Mike try to make a fool of me.

90
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,960
I won’t let that happen.

91
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,600
If you don’t like them,

92
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,840
just stay away from them.

93
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,800
Why did you brag and show off to them?

94
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,120
You made the trouble.

95
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,520
Handle it by yourself.

96
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,440
I am kind to you.

97
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,000
You must help me.

98
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,440
And

99
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,320
I have promised you

100
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,840
to reduce half of your debt.

101
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,880
If you still think it’s unfair,

102
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,920
how about two thirds?

103
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:29,880
Ye Qianyu.

104
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,600
Not all things

105
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,120
can be measured by money.

106
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,400
I don’t know

107
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,880
you are so vain

108
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,640
until now.

109
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,600
You don’t help me.

110
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,880
Why do you scold me?

111
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,600
Is it vain of me to pretend to be rich?

112
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,200
Do I deserve to be mocked

113
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,280
and despised?

114
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,800
Why not be your true self in front of them?

115
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,280
I’m not rich.

116
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,480
Go to ask someone else for help.

117
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,920
You do look like him.

118
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,760
Why not disguise as him

119
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,560
and go to the party with my sister?

120
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,320
Why do you let me pretend to be the rich?

121
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,680
Is it shameful to be poor?

122
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,640
Why can’t I

123
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,960
go to the party with my true identity?

124
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,280
Move to that side.

125
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,440
Let me tell you.

126
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,600
My sister loved a boy

127
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,840
named Mike in school.

128
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,520
Her classmate Dai Anfen made a fool of her

129
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,800
and said Mike liked her too.

130
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,480
She even

131
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,680
asked her to confess her love to Mike at a party.

132
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,000
Mike deliberately asked her to dance in public,

133
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,960
but rejected her.

134
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,200
From then on,

135
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,120
her classmates nicknamed her Clumsy Dance Queen.

136
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,720
Your sister loves so many boys.

137
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,320
Oh, right.

138
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,720
Wait a second. Let me show you something.

139
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,480
Is your car repaired?

140
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,360
My old pickup often breaks down.

141
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,840
I have to repair it every three or five days.

142
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:28,902
Thanks to it,

143
00:07:28,902 --> 00:07:30,520
I’m adept at repairing cars now.

144
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,360
Mama Jinzhi said

145
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,600
you would have a classmate party tomorrow. Right?

146
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,800
Yes.

147
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,840
Is this party special?

148
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,280
You know

149
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,600
classmate parties.

150
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,560
They wear the best clothes,

151
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,120
take the best bags

152
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,400
and drive the best cars

153
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,960
to show off themselves.

154
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,280
But I have nothing to show off.

155
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,200
I made a trouble for myself.

156
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,240
I’m sure

157
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,920
they will make fun of me tomorrow.

158
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,480
What trouble?

159
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,960
Ye Qianyu keeps a diary.

160
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,320
She writes down everything, including secrets,

161
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,160
in the diary.

162
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:20,640
Wait a second.

163
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,920
My mom couldn’t afford storybooks for me,

164
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,360
so I read her diary.

165
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,120
It’s much more interesting

166
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,160
than the storybooks.

167
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,440
Let me see.

168
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:34,680
This diary

169
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,920
is about Dai Anfen and Mike making a fool of her.

170
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:37,800
Look.

171
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,600
These words were blurred

172
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,800
by her tears.

173
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,800
Please have pity on her.

174
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,800
I had a crush on my classmate before.

175
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,800
He made fun of me

176
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,720
and asked me to dance in public.

177
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,440
Yesterday

178
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,960
I ran into him at Guanmei.

179
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,120
To anger him,

180
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,200
I said

181
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,960
I have a rich boyfriend.

182
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,800
I didn’t expect

183
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,640
he invited me to a classmate party

184
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:08,400
with a boyfriend.

185
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,320
If he won’t see my boyfriend,

186
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,440
he will spread my awkward dance videos

187
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,840
all over the world.

188
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,920
I do want to watch your awkward dance videos.

189
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,880
I never want to watch it.

190
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,400
Girls tend to hide their feelings.

191
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,160
Although my sister wants to marry a rich man,

192
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,160
and my mom also wants her to marry Taichu,

193
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,400
I think

194
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,680
you still have a great chance.

195
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,320
You must seize it.

196
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,640
Taichu can’t go.

197
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,800
You may disguise as a rich man

198
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,280
and go to the party with my sister.

199
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,240
It’s a rare opportunity to get close to her.

200
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,560
I am not rich.

201
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,960
I don’t want to disguise as him.

202
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,560
But

203
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,600
Tonghao is right.

204
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,800
It isn’t a shame to be poor

205
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,240
or have no boyfriend.

206
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,880
I shouldn’t be afraid of Dai Anfen.

207
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,520
I should stand in front of her

208
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,560
and tell her

209
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,440
who I am.

210
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,800
That’s the right way to fight back.

211
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:25,760
Yes.

212
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,160
I am who I am.

213
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,600
I am who I am.

214
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,000
I am who I am.

215
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,520
The party will be held tomorrow.

216
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,680
You must go to save my sister.

217
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,560
Or else she will be extremely embarrassed.

218
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:43,360
She always hopes a Prince Charming

219
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,440
can show up and rescue her when she’s in distress.

220
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,680
This is your chance.

221
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,000
You must seize it.

222
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,400
Tonghao.

223
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,240
Just disguise as Taichu

224
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,960
and go to the party with Qianyu.

225
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,640
Just go.

226
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,000
It’s not a big deal.

227
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,200
Right?

228
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,440
I’m going to deliver the goods.

229
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,520
If you don’t go,

230
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,000
Dai Anfen will embarrass Qianyu.

231
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,400
Alas. Tonghao.

232
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,800
I’m leaving.

233
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,320
Mom.

234
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,520
You take care of the store.

235
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,200
I will get prepared

236
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,880
to go to the party.

237
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,600
Neither Tonghao nor Taichu will go with you.

238
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,640
How will you go?

239
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,760
I’ve made up my mind.

240
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,275
I will tell Dai Anfen

241
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,440
I don’t have a rich boyfriend.

242
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,000
I lied to her.

243
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,000
She made a fool of you.

244
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,640
Now you will go ask for an insult.

245
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,240
Don’t go.

246
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:37,800
No.

247
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,800
I will.

248
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,240
I will tell her loudly

249
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,200
who I am.

250
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:50,880
What’s this?

251
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,480
It was from Taichu.

252
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,480
He also specially

253
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,800
sent the car key to you.

254
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,160
Taichu?

255
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,800
Ye Qianyu doesn’t seem to come today.

256
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,600
Right.

257
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,240
We can’t watch the show prepared for her.

258
00:13:36,725 --> 00:13:38,776
I knew she would not come.

259
00:13:39,025 --> 00:13:40,100
Funny.

260
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,200
It doesn’t matter.

261
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,480
Ye Qianyu.

262
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,400
Where’s your boyfriend?

263
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,280
Dai Anfen.

264
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,400
I come to tell you...

265
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,880
Attention, please.

266
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,520
Look who comes here.

267
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,960
It is our Clumsy Dance Queen.

268
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,280
Let’s welcome her.

269
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:22,960
Qianyu.

270
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,240
Where is your boyfriend?

271
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,360
You said he would come with you.

272
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,720
Why do you come alone?

273
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,720
Did you lie to me?

274
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:38,760
I...

275
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,240
Mike.

276
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,280
Ziqian?

277
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,425
I thought you wouldn’t come.

278
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,520
This is my girlfriend Dai Anfen.

279
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,360
This is Xu Ziqian,

280
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,880
the friend I mentioned to you before.

281
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,240
Hello.

282
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,120
Hello.

283
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,400
This is my friend Fan Yunyi.

284
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,200
Hello.

285
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,025
Hello.

286
00:15:56,725 --> 00:15:58,120
You come so late.

287
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,680
The traffic was heavy. Sorry.

288
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,600
Never mind.

289
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,160
Can you play snooker?

290
00:16:03,175 --> 00:16:03,730
Yes. A little bit.

291
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,200
Shall we play together?

292
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,520
OK.

293
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,587
Ziqian.

294
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,825
You play snooker so well.

295
00:16:46,075 --> 00:16:46,814
You almost pot

296
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,830
all balls by one break.

297
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,720
Actually, my skill is ordinary.

298
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,480
The best player as far as I know

299
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,360
is Shan Junhao.

300
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,000
He can easily

301
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,800
break the deadlock like this.

302
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,480
He is the only person

303
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,400
who scores a century I’ve ever seen myself.

304
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,360
Is he so awesome?

305
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,920
Few can score a century

306
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,040
in the whole nation.

307
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,120
Yes.

308
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,920
His skill is as good as
that of professional players.

309
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,800
Ziqian,

310
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,520
you may play here.

311
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,750
I wanna take a walk.

312
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,640
I’ll go with you.

313
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,040
Excuse me.

314
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,480
Do they...

315
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,240
I don’t know, either.

316
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:15,960
Hey.

317
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,880
Where is Ye Qianyu?

318
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,280
Taichu.

319
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,280
According to your report, you think

320
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,520
it isn’t best choice

321
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,200
to collapse and rebuild

322
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,480
Guanmei Fishing Village?

323
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,160
Mr. Wang.

324
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,480
In the past month

325
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,320
I’ve been in Guanmei Fishing Village.

326
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,280
It is a very beautiful

327
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,680
and humanistic village.

328
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,560
It is beautiful

329
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,600
not only because of its natural scenery,

330
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,440
but also its humanism.

331
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,560
They have their own stories,

332
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,640
and their own history.

333
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,840
Completely rebuilding it

334
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,960
with modern constructions

335
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,480
may bring more harm than good.

336
00:18:59,040 --> 00:18:59,920
I suggest

337
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:00,920
not to destroy

338
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,425
the historic buildings

339
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,960
which bear the soul of this island.

340
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,600
But now Senwell’s general manager is changed.

341
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:09,760
Do you think

342
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,280
they can still do this project well?

343
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:12,880
Mr. Wang.

344
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,000
This is beyond my evaluation.

345
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,120
Right.

346
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,200
I’ll ask them

347
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,360
to modify the plan

348
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,560
according to your report.

349
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,320
Thanks for your recognition, Mr. Wang.

350
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,400
It’s late.

351
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,560
How about we eat dinner together?

352
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,240
Well, I’ll order seats.

353
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,760
No, thanks. Mr. Wang.

354
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,760
I have an appointment tonight.

355
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,520
Maybe next time.

356
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,600
You keep looking at your watch.

357
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,360
This appointment must be very important.

358
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,160
Your girlfriend?

359
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,200
OK.

360
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,360
Let’s call it a day.

361
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,000
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

362
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:46,840
Goodbye.

363
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,320
Goodbye.

364
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,280
Sir. May you speed up?

365
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,640
No.

366
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,840
There are many speed limits here.

367
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,320
I’ll take the responsibility. Alright?

368
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,520
No.

369
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,680
Safety first.

370
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,600
Qianyu.

371
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,160
You didn’t leave?

372
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,600
I thought you have left.

373
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,240
How could I leave?

374
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,840
This wine is good.

375
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:31,760
Really?

376
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,560
Then drink as much as you please.

377
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:35,760
Oh, right.

378
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,040
Where’s your boyfriend

379
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:37,840
giving you

380
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,475
car keys and villa keys?

381
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:42,803
Didn’t he come with you?

382
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:46,800
Boyfriend?

383
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,400
My boyfriend...

384
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,720
Actually, I don’t have...

385
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,960
Qianyu.

386
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:11,920
Why do you come here?

387
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,680
Sorry.

388
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,600
I’m late.

389
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,360
They must be your classmates,

390
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,360
Dai Anfen and Mike.

391
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:27,720
Hello.

392
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,680
I’m Shan Junhao.

393
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,920
Shan Junhao?

394
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,360
Are you Shan Junhao

395
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,800
from Senwell?

396
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,560
Qianyu asked me to meet her classmates.

397
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,320
So I’m here.

398
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,480
You’re Mike, whom Qianyu had a crush on?

399
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,880
Nice to meet you.

400
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,640
That’s when we were in school.

401
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,240
Excuse me.

402
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,325
Come here.

403
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,200
What’s going on?

404
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,240
I don’t know, either.

405
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:05,960
Why do you come?

406
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,960
To be your Prince Charming.

407
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,600
Surprised?

408
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,520
Is it really Shan Junhao?

409
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,000
You’re charming in a suit.

410
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,120
In fact, I only meet him once.

411
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,760
I was far away from him.

412
00:23:18,698 --> 00:23:19,827
- Did you rent this?
- I didn’t remember it clearly.

413
00:23:19,827 --> 00:23:21,055
He may be fake.

414
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,320
How could a village girl like Ye Qianyu

415
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,160
know big shots like Shan Junhao?

416
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,600
Shan Junhao is the general manager of Senwell.

417
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,480
He’s much richer than Taichu.

418
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,280
Don’t you know this?

419
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,400
Do you figure out his identity

420
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,440
before disguising as him?

421
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,400
Of course.

422
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,840
What’s his identity then?

423
00:23:42,526 --> 00:23:43,566
How did you get the flowers?

424
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:45,729
I bought them for you. Do you like them?

425
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,800
Shan Junhao.

426
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,440
I heard that you’re a snooker master

427
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,360
who can score a century.

428
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,440
How about

429
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,320
we have a game?

430
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,280
What?

431
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:09,840
Don’t you dare to challenge me?

432
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,400
If you’re Shan Junhao for real,

433
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,240
please show us

434
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,160
your snooker skills.

435
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,680
Sure.

436
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,720
Can you play snooker?

437
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,360
Nope.

438
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,360
This is the unfinished game

439
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,360
between Xu Ziqian

440
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,360
and Mike.

441
00:25:13,923 --> 00:25:15,695
Xu Ziqian said just now

442
00:25:15,797 --> 00:25:18,033
only Shan Junhao could break the deadlock.

443
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,640
Then you showed up.

444
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,240
What a coincidence.

445
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,520
You know.

446
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,680
Everyone here

447
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
is looking forward to watching your show.

448
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,760
Am I right?

449
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,160
Yes.

450
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,880
Is he really that awesome?

451
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:41,397
It seems he truly is Shan Junhao.

452
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,680
He does look like that guy I saw before.

453
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,520
It should be him.

454
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,880
Shan Junhao’s cuff

455
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,800
tailored by my sister, a designer.

456
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,040
There’s a mark S specific to Shan family on it.

457
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,120
That’s unique.

458
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,440
Really?

459
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,160
I never expected the ugly duckling Ye Qianyu

460
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,480
could have Shan Junhao as her boyfriend.

461
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,560
But I heard that

462
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,000
Shan Junhao was going to

463
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,120
be engaged to the adopted daughter of his family.

464
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:22,530
I have no idea

465
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:23,970
why he has a new girlfriend.

466
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,040
Weird.

467
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,120
Right.

468
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,720
Do you mean Fan Yunyi?

469
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:30,680
No wonder

470
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,000
her expression was strange when you

471
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,600
talked about Shan Junhao just now.

472
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,560
What would happen

473
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,480
if Xu Ziqian, Fan Yunyi

474
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,560
and Shan Junhao

475
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,400
all stood here?

476
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,240
But Xu Ziqian has already left.

477
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,600
Shan Junhao,

478
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,000
you are really something.

479
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,280
I’m not gossiping.

480
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,720
I heard that you left your fiancée Fan Yunyi

481
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,240
and ran away on the engagement ceremony.

482
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,320
Was it because of Qianyu?

483
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,720
What is exactly the charm of Qianyu

484
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,960
that attracts you?

485
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,440
Love is wonderful.

486
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,120
You’re willing to pay everything for it.

487
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,120
Listen. Listen.

488
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,920
Qianyu. You are so lucky

489
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,000
that you meet your Prince Charming finally.

490
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:02,720
Could you tell us

491
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,320
your love stories?

492
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,320
We...

493
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,360
We...

494
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,160
We...

495
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,120
Well...

496
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,160
Well. One day

497
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,920
I fell into the sea from a boat.

498
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,760
Qianyu saved me.

499
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,720
She couldn’t tell kiss from artificial respiration

500
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,720
and blamed me for taking away her first kiss.

501
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,600
She asked me to give it back to her.

502
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,800
So we are together.

503
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,320
Yes.

504
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,720
I normally catch seaweeds

505
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,120
or shrimps from the sea.

506
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,560
I never thought I could

507
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,320
catch a boyfriend there.

508
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,360
Ye Qianyu. You’re so lucky.

509
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,880
Yes, indeed.

510
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,160
Are you unhappy

511
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,440
for Junhao was brought up?

512
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,960
I know Junhao’s position in your heart,

513
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,280
as well as his importance to you.

514
00:30:20,998 --> 00:30:23,500
But I agree with Aunt Jiang.

515
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,400
I hope you can let the pain go

516
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,520
and restart your life.

517
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,040
Hadn’t you been with me,

518
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:35,840
I would

519
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,600
have no idea how to live.

520
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,920
Thank you.

521
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,200
My comfort and companionship

522
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,240
can only relieve your pain for now.

523
00:30:49,904 --> 00:30:51,160
Only you can get yourself

524
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:53,261
out of it.

525
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,320
I can’t make it.

526
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,200
You’ve done very well.

527
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,400
I have an advice.

528
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,440
You may try to smile more often.

529
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,480
Like this.

530
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,560
Why did you pretend to be Shan Junhao?

531
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,200
What if someone knew him here?

532
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,360
Play it by ear.

533
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,480
I don’t want to pretend to be Taichu anyway.

534
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,480
However,

535
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,000
you do look like

536
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,389
a rich man in this suit.

537
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,360
Am I handsome?

538
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,800
Don’t tell you.

539
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,240
Your clothes, bag and shoes

540
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,280
are also quite expensive.

541
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,800
You spend a lot of money

542
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,960
in attending this party.

543
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,200
I feel terrible in this suit,

544
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,600
especially the shoes.

545
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,200
I don’t have money to buy them.

546
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,160
They were given by Taichu.

547
00:32:14,144 --> 00:32:15,728
I’m pissed off

548
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,959
with Ye Qianyu’s arrogance.

549
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,200
Luckily we’ve reserved a show for her.

550
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,200
No.

551
00:32:23,187 --> 00:32:24,415
Don’t mess with Shan Junhao

552
00:32:24,487 --> 00:32:25,303
for making fun of Ye Qianyu.

553
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,280
He is a handful.

554
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,560
Shan Junhao?

555
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,920
So what?

556
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,560
If Shan Junhao watches

557
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,600
her awkward video

558
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,880
that she danced and confessed her love to you,

559
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,880
he will dump her in public.

560
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,480
Aren’t you mad

561
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,680
about her arrogance?

562
00:32:39,877 --> 00:32:41,288
I’m pissed off.

563
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,000
No. I will give her a good lesson.

564
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,560
If you make a fool of her,

565
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,000
you will make Shan Junhao lose face.

566
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,760
Besides my dad’s company

567
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,000
still cooperates with Senwell.

568
00:32:49,924 --> 00:32:51,642
Do not mess with Shan Junhao.

569
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,480
Would you eat cake?

570
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:57,760
Would you?

571
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:58,680
No.

572
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,240
It’s tasty.

573
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,200
It’s good.

574
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,360
Don’t move.

575
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,240
I’m so happy today.

576
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,840
I used to dream

577
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,680
Prince Charming could come

578
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,880
and save me.

579
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,520
I never thought

580
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,120
he did show up today.

581
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,840
I am not Prince Charming.

582
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,960
I’m just a frog in Prince’s suit.

583
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,840
I made

584
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:43,920
a dream before.

585
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,600
In the dream, a frog said he was a cursed prince.

586
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,120
Only my kiss could break the spell.

587
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:51,800
Tonghao.

588
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,720
Do you ever think that

589
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,840
you were a prince

590
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,120
before you lost your memory?

591
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,960
Then your kiss is the cure.

592
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,480
Where are we going?

593
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,200
Home.

594
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,760
Go home now?

595
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,680
The magic will disappear once we get home.

596
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,400
I will be Cinderella

597
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,120
and you will be the frog.

598
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,320
I wish I could keep the feeling now,

599
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,920
even if it’s only today.

600
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,120
Let me take you to a place.

601
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,200
Where?

602
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
You’ll know it soon.

603
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,360
= Enchanted Forest =

604
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,360
So beautiful!

605
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,400
Get off.

606
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,200
You said you didn’t want the magic disappear.

607
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,120
And?

608
00:37:43,223 --> 00:37:44,740
= Enchanted Forest =

609
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,440
Let me

be your prince tonight.

611
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,560

You said you wanted to take Ferris wheel

655
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,200
with your love in the moonlight.

656
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,120
How do you know?

657
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,320
You read my diary.

658
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,200
I didn’t.

659
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,440
Shengzhe showed it to me.

660
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,160
He says he takes your diary

661
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,480
as a model of compositions.

662
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,680
Ye Shengzhe, you little imp.

663
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,200
Let’s go.

664
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,880
Don’t.

665
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,880
160 yuan per ticket. Too expensive.

666
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,160
Don’t.

667
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,720
You know the password

668
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,040
of Mama Jinzhi’s credit card. Right?

669
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,440
Birthdate of Shengzhe.

670
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,440
Another order.

671
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:00,920
What?

672
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,160
Ye Qianyu!

673
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,320
You stole my credit card!

674
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,920
You went too far!

675
00:41:08,836 --> 00:41:10,486
This is my first time to take Ferris wheel.

676
00:41:10,486 --> 00:41:11,454
Am I very rustic?

677
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,480
No, not at all.

678
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,040
Because we share a lot of

679
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,560
first-time memories.

680
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,000
For example,

681
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:26,080
it’s my first time to camp with a girl.

682
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,920
The first time to see stars with a girl.

683
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,680
The first time to lie for a girl.

684
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:33,920
Me too.

685
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,680
It’s my first time

686
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,400
to stay up so late with a boy.

687
00:41:37,767 --> 00:41:39,412
The first time to be carried by a boy.

688
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,480
The first time to take Ferris wheel with a boy.

689
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,600
Tonghao.

690
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,840
I have a question for you.

691
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,040
In the party just now,

692
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,240
that...

693
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,280
That kiss

694
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,920
was also part of acting?

695
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,040
Look at me.

696
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,560
What?

697
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:00,960
If this kiss is acting,

698
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,800
I’d like to keep acting for good.

699
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,120
It’s said the lovers

700
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:17,240
who kiss at the top of Ferris wheel

701
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,600
will be happy forever.

702
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:23,280
Is it a tale made up by you?

703
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,640
How about we

704
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,920
validate this tale together by this lifetime?

705
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,600
Your ring seems special.

706
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,360
Why do you keep it on all the time?

707
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,200
I have no idea.

708
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,000
I cannot take it off anymore

709
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,400
since the day I put it on.

710
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:52,480
I think

711
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,480
its only meaning

712
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,160
should be

713
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,560
related with you.

714
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,920
Maybe you will recall it one day.

715
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:22,960
Alright.

716
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,680
I kissed this ring.

717
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,680
So

718
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,200
it has memory about me.

719
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,200
Tonghao.

720
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:39,240
If your memory is recovered one day,

721
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,120
will you forget me?

722
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,200
Of course not.

723
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,800
Even if my memory is recovered,

724
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,680
I will not leave you.

725
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:51,800
Because I love you.

726
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:54,520
