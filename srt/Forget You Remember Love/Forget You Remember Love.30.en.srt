What took you so long?

63
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:21,920
I drafted up the agreement

64

and passed it to finance and legal departments,

65
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,200

to stamp it.

I had to rush them repeatedly.

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,040
Sorry, Mr. Shan.

81
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,550

00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,230
the best place

194
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:53,400
for us to say goodbye.

195
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,030
How is this possible?

196
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,670
Are you sure Mr. Shan gave this to you?

197
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,030
Yeah, he handed it to me

198
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,590
in person.

199
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:43,590
Ye Shengzhe,

200
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:45,400
go do your homework. What are you doing here?

201
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,280
Go ahead. Be good.

202
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:51,550
Hey, read it carefully.

203
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,710
I am reading it.

204
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,350
Mama Jinzhi.

205
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:59,230
- Taichu. - Mr. Tang.

206
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:00,350
What brings you here?

207
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,670
Where’s Qianyu?

208
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,350
She went out.

209
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,230
Where did she go?

210
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:14,440
We said

211
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,640
to make plans for this trip.

212
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:18,550
She...

213
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,590
She went out with Shan Junhao.

214
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,760
Did they say where they’d go?

215
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,960
They didn’t say anything.

216
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,150
I’ll wait for her here.

217
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,220
What are you looking at?

218
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,180
= Guanmei Inn Joint Operation Agreement =

219
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,670
Mrs. Lin.

220
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,400
Is Junhao back?

221
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:57,910
Not yet.

222
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,760
This is

223
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:42,310
where Tonghao and I had our first date

224
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,760
and also the last.

225
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,920
I’m suddenly curious

226
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,950
about everything happened

227
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,160
between you and him.

228
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,520
Since you’ve forgotten,

229
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,000
just let it go.

230
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,560
It shouldn’t bother you.

231
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,950
Riding merry-go-round is romantic,

232
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:54,470
but the two on the horses

233
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,950
will always move in circles and behind each other.

234
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,350
They’ll never advance together

235
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,830
or cross paths with each other.

236
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:33,470
This is my first date with Shan Junhao

237
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,760
and probably the last.

238
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,680
= Joint Operation Agreement =

239
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,760
What does this mean?

240
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,230
According to the agreement,

241
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:35,430
Senwell will build

242
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:37,310
a brand new Guanmei Inn in three years.

243
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,400
All the profits will belong to Senwell.

244
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:42,560
Mr. Tang and the staff

245
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,680
will become official employees of the inn

246
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,160
and will enjoy salaries and bonuses accordingly.

247
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,880
After that, Senwell will

248
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,950
return the shares to Mr. Tang unconditionally.

249
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,520
In a word,

250
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,800
this agreement

251
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,640
won’t benefit Senwell at all.

252
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,520
Why did Shan Junhao do this?

253
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,190
Yes. He didn’t say anything.

254
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:07,230
He just gave it to me and left.

255
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,110
Is this

256
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,520
a trap?

257
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,590
All the clauses

258
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:16,000
are written clearly.

259
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,760
There’s no ambiguity.

260
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:20,430
It’s already been signed and stamped by Senwell.

261
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:22,190
Mr. Tang, once you sign it,

262
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:24,040
it’ll take effect immediately.

263
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,590
By doing this,

264
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,400
isn’t he giving the inn back to me

265
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,470
for free?

266
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:35,190
Yes.

267
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:40,920
Is it possible

268
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:43,190
that he regained his memory as Tonghao?

269
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:50,280
Looks like he still has a conscience.

270
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,470
I didn’t feed an ingrate.

271
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,470
Mr. Ziqian.

272
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:02,830
Mrs. Lin, where’s Yunyi?

273
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,520
She’s upstairs.

274
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,060
= Taichu =

275
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,900
= Yunyi =

276
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,280
Hello, Taichu?

277
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,110
Hello, Qianyu?

278
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,640
Why didn’t you pick up your phone?

279
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,350
Sorry,

280
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,800
I didn’t hear the ring tone.

281
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:35,920
Where are you?

282
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I’m...

283
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,280
I’m at the amusement park.

284
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:48,400
Where’s Shan Junhao?

285
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,620
What’s going on?

286
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:58,160
He’s here with me.

287
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:06,230
Hello?

288
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,520
Junhao,

289
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,680
where are you?

290
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,710
I’m out for business.

291
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:16,310
When will you come back?

292
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:19,560
Mrs. Lin cooked your favorite food today.

293
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,950
Eat without me.

294
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:25,110
I’ll come home once it’s done.

295
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:27,280
Junhao,

296
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,310
our wedding is tomorrow.

297
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,640
Don’t be back too late,

298
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:35,430
or Mom and I will worry.

299
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:37,470
Come back early if you can.

300
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,470
We’re leaving tomorrow.

301
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:45,280
I know.

302
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,000
I’ll wait for you.

303
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,160
Qianyu,

304
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:32,850
we...

305
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:33,920
We should go back.

306
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,070
Yunyi.

307
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,040
Ziqian.

308
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:36,040
Is the decoration done for tomorrow’s wedding?

309
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,950
It’s...

310
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,190
Perfect.

311
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,280
Too bad,

312
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,560
I can’t see it.

313
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:53,470
Don’t be sad.

314
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,070
I’ll tell the photographer to take lots of photos.

315
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,520
Once you recover,

316
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:01,680
you can see them yourself.

317
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:03,160
I know

318
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:05,430
you’ll make everything flawlessly.

319
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,920
Junhao...

320
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,040
He lied to you.

321
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,470
It’s OK.

322
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,880
I can forgive him.

323
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,880
You still want to marry him

324
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:33,640
even after knowing

325
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,800
he doesn’t love you?

326
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:37,110
Ziqian.

327
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,110
Don’t try to persuade me.

328
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:42,230
I want nothing else

329
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:44,520
other than marrying Junhao.

330
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,230
It’s not too late.

331
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:49,800
You still can change your mind.

332
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,310
I’m sure

333
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:53,520
Junhao will come back.

334
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,760
Why are you sacrificing yourself for him?

335
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,310
It’s about your lifetime happiness.

336
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:01,880
It’s not a sacrifice.

337
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,640
I’m getting married with the man
I love the most tomorrow.

338
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,280
I am happy.

339
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:12,590
He doesn’t deserve you.

340
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,190
He doesn’t.

341
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,190
Ziqian.

342
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:25,280
Can you do me a favor?

343
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,070
Dad left us.

344
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:31,280
Can you

345
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:34,520
walk me down the aisle tomorrow?

346
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:42,060
This matter is important

347
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,160
to me.

348
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,280
OK.

349
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:53,310
I’ll be there for you.

350
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,640
Yunyi,

351
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,000
I’m leaving.

352
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:11,000
I’ll go find her.

353
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:12,550
What?

354
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,520
How come things turned out like this?

355
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,000
Director Xu.

356
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,040
Everything is ready.

357
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:54,350
Be careful. Don’t let anyone get hurt.

358
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:57,760
Yes. I’ll go back to work.

359
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,280
Right now,

360
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,520
you’re still willing to help Shan Junhao

361
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,950
prepare this wedding?

362
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,630
What are you doing here?

363
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,870
I finished discussing cooperation plans with MC

364
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,360
and saw you here,

365
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:25,560
so I came to check on you.

366
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:30,840
Ziqian,

367
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,390
are you letting the Shans off the hook like this?

368
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:40,430
Stay out of it.

369
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,870
It’s my own business.

370
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,040
You look calm

371
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,800
but in a scary way.

372
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:44,910
Qianyu...

373
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,360
Sign it. It’s OK.

374
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:04,560
No.

375
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,760
I have to think again.

376
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,760
Even Taichu said it’s legit.

377
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,040
Should I sign it or not?

378
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,870
You’re back, Qianyu!

379
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:16,040
Where did you go? We’re worried sick!

380
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:17,360
I’m fine.

381
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,320
Didn’t Taichu come back with you?

382
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,390
Taichu?

383
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,120
Yeah. He was worried and went out to find you.

384
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:24,870
Yes.

385
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:31,740
= Taichu: Wait for me. =

386
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:39,060
= I’m home. =

387
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:52,260
= Ye Qianyu: I’m home. =

388
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,910
Hey, Qianyu,

389
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:11,600
Shan Junhao said he’d return the inn to us.

390
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:15,150
He’s giving the inn back?

391
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:16,120
Yes.

392
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,320
Read this.

393
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:21,320
= Joint Operation Agreement =

394
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,430
It says

395
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:26,040
we can still work in the inn as usual.

396
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:26,910
That’s right.

397
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:27,870
Once the three-year period is over,

398
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:29,280
he’ll officially

399
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,430
return the inn to me.

400
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:31,280
Yes.

401
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,710
Should I sign it

402
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,120
or not?

403
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,280
I think

404
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,320
Shan Junhao and Tonghao

405
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,760
have become a whole.

406
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,390
Yes.

407
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,320
Where are you going now?

408
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,150
Isn’t that Qianyu’s truck?

409
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:30,190
Li,

410
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:32,670
did you see a car numbered 6A888?

411
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,560
No.

412
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:38,630
This is the only path to Guanmei Fishing Village.

413
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:39,940
We’ve been here for a while.

414
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:41,560
No sign of the car you said.

415
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:48,000
What’s wrong?

416
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,470
I’ll stay and wait for it with you.

417
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,360
Qianyu,

418
00:40:57,670 --> 00:41:00,800
is that Mr. Shan’s car?

419
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:04,320
I saw it

420
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,630
when he came last time.

421
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,630
It’s late.

422
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:14,040
Why would his car be here?

423
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:16,760
Uh...

424
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,950
We just parted

425
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:20,000
but I have something else to tell him.

426
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,020
Qianyu,

427
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:29,190
I heard

428
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,190
you’re leaving tomorrow

429
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:33,950
with that traveler to tour around the world.

430
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:43,600
Yes.

431
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,280
Taichu?

432
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:53,800
Hello,

433
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:54,710
sobriety test.

434
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,080
It’s routine.

435
00:41:58,670 --> 00:41:59,670
It is him.

436
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:01,390
Clean. You may leave.

437
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:03,840
Qianyu. What are you doing here?

438
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:14,840
Uncle Li.

439
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,870
Qianyu. Where were you?

440
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:20,390
Mama Jinzhi and I are worried sick.

441
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:25,120
You guys talk. I’ll go over there.

442
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:29,560
Let me drive you back. Come on.

443
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:36,840
Qianyu,

444
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:38,560
what’s wrong?

445
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,870
I’m waiting for Shan Junhao.

446
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:43,120
Shan Junhao?

447
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,150
Why would he be here?

448
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,250
Is it

449
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,560
because of that agreement?

450
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:10,000
Take it

451
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,150
as his last gift for your village.

452
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,120
Qianyu,

453
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:16,360
he’s getting married tomorrow.

454
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:17,760
And we’re leaving the country.

455
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,710
We should

456
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:21,280
accept that gift.

457
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:27,880
It’s late. Let’s go.

458
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,140
Come on.

459
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,150
Alright.

460
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:42,950
Uncle Li, good night.

461
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:53,630
Bye, Uncle Li.

462
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:34,670
Stop the car, please.

463
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,760
Hello, sobriety test.

464
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,520
Clean. You may leave.

465
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:46,710
Mr. Shan.

466
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:51,040
Mr. Shan.

467
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:52,320
You’re late.

468
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:54,520
Qianyu was here waiting for you.

469
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,910
Where is she now?

470
00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:03,600
She just went back with Taichu.

471
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:13,820
= Li Dawei =

472
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,000
Hello, Dawei?

473
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:19,800
Mr. Shan,

474
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:20,600
we’ve found out

475
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:23,000
who leaked the information to the media.

476
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,630
I see. Let’s talk in person later.

477
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:28,360
OK.

478
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:42,840
