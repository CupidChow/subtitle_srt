Mrs. Shan take me for?

13

These rich people

14
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,310
are so snobbish.

15
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,790
I am poor,

16
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,440
but I would never steal.

17
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:56,480
I just wanted to try it on.

18
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,830
All right, Mama Jinzhi.

19
00:01:58,830 --> 00:01:59,720
Don’t be angry.

20
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,310
It’s gone now.

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,080
Qianyu,

22
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,720
I’m sorry.

23
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,830
I put you in that awkward position.

24
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,470
Mom, you didn’t.

25
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,160
You think too much.

26
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,320
Let’s go home.

27
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,460
Let’s go.

28
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,200
That’s it.

29
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,000
I think it’s OK.

30
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,030
The goddamned bracelet

31
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,000
was stuck on my wrist for all day!

32
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,670
I’m relieved, finally.

33
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,190
All right.

34
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,520
It’ll be over after we send it back tomorrow.

35
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,440
I’m sorry you have to go back there.

36
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,190
Mom, it’s OK.

37
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,440
Is Qianyu alright?

38
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,960
Jinzhi.

39
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,440
I…

40
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,520
I’ll work hard on the inn

41
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,920
and give you a better life.

42
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,190
Why do you bring it up?

43
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,190
I’ll go check on Qianyu.

44
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:54,190
Sure.

45
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,160
Mom, you must be tired.

46
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,800
I’ve never met

47
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,880
such an outrageous family.

48
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,160
Junhao,

49
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,240
fire Ye Qianyu immediately.

50
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,230
Mom,

51
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,000
Ye Qianyu didn’t do anything wrong.

52
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,950
Senwell won’t

53
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,510
fire an employee without good reason.

54
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:28,480
As one of the service staff of Senwell Hotel

55
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,720
and a waitress of the party,

56
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,790
she connived at her mom’s thievery.

57
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,040
Isn’t that wrong?

58
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,270
Ye Qianyu’s mom didn’t steal anything.

59
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,920
I’ve made it clear.

60
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,880
If Yunyi and I didn’t catch her red-handed,

61
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,390
the bracelet would have been stolen by her.

62
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,000
Doesn’t that make her a thief?

63
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,790
And she made these excuses.

64
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,920
Why did you speak for her?

65
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,480
I didn’t speak for them.

66
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,880
I just didn’t want to carry the matter further

67
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,160
on your birthday party.

68
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,000
Really?

69
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,600
Is it really for my consideration?

70
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,110
OK.

71
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,070
Fire Ye Qianyu immediately.

72
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,270
Mom,

73
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,160
Qianyu is a kind girl.

74
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,200
You shouldn’t be prejudiced against her.

75
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,200
Junhao,

76
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:17,040
you’re about to marry Yunyi.

77
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,760
Don’t get another involved.

78
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,230
Fire Ye Qianyu immediately.

79
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,760
And bring your life back to normal.

80
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,230
So you can be happy with Yunyi.

81
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,270
You can’t ruin

82
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,000
someone’s future with just words.

83
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,640
We have no right to dominate other’s life.

84
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,230
What has

85
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,320
that girl done to you?

86
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,230
Why are you defending her?

87
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,920
She has nothing to do with this, Mom.

88
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,070
Junhao.

89
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,110
Junhao,

90
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,200
it’s Mom’s birthday.

91
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,830
Don’t make her angry.

92
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,320
Anyway,

93
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,320
it’s gone.

94
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,510
Go to bed.

95
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,480
I have work to do.

96
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,200
What’s in your mind?

97
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,070
I’m thinking

98
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,480
we are not equal, actually,

99
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:27,670
right?

100
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,270
A family like ours

101
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,000
would surely be regarded as thieves.

102
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:38,000
In fact, in front of death and diseases,

103
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,320
we’re all equal.

104
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,390
No one can escape from that.

105
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,880
When they accused us of thievery,

106
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:54,600
I felt I was so insignificant and humble.

107
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,640
It was the first time I had that feeling.

108
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,440
Is it because of Shan Junhao?

109
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,160
No.

110
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,880
Shan Junhao and Tonghao

111
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,790
are different.

112
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,200
We don’t need to care about

113
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,480
others’ judgement.

114
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:22,230
If you change yourself due to others’ judgement,

115
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,880
you’ll no longer be yourself.

116
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,790
Do you know why I like travelling?

117
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,550
Because when you’re on the road,

118
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,230
there’s no restraints.

119
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,270
You can be yourself.

120
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,670
I wish I can be as free as you, too.

121
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:53,270
As long as you want to,

122
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,200
you can be free, too.

123
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,000
Joey,

124
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,230
why did you replace that waitress

125
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,960
to serve in Shan Mansion?

126
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:27,260
I got Mr. Shan’s notice out of blue

127
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,180
to assign Ye Qianyu to the party.

128
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:32,410
She didn’t do anything wrong, did she?

129
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,640
No, I see.

130
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,220

Junhao, where are you?

134
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,960
I want to be alone.

135
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,840
Don’t come back too late.

136
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,880
Don’t wait for me.

137
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,320
Go to sleep.

138
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,230
Tell Mom to go to bed early.

139
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,150
I will wait for you.

140
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,110
Junhao,

141
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,000
I love you.

142
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:36,570
Do you love me?

143
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,330
Yunyi,

144
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:42,810
don’t think too much.

145
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,200
Go to bed.

146
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,960
Drive safe.

What brings you here?

152
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:54,710
I don’t know, either.

153
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:59,400
I just drove my car here.

154
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,550
I’ve never come here before,

155
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,550
but it looks familiar.

156
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,550
Did Tonghao

157
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,280
come here with you before?

158
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:40,670
It’s all gone.

159
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,150
By the way,

160
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,710
thank you for today.

161
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:49,790
No need to thank me.

162
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,640
Since I met you,

163
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,960
I’ve been in a tangle.

164
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,320
I’m used to it.

165
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:02,230
But there’s never been a person like you.

166
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,280
What about me?

167
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:15,320
In the past, I thought

168
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,150
you were a common, plain,

169
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,760
rude and impolite person.

170
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,520
What

171
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:27,670
about you that attracts me?

172
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,880
Do you come all the way in midnight

173
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,670
to ridicule me?

174
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,230
You must be very bored, Mr. Shan.

175
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,710
But I’m thinking of you all the time.

176
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:48,150
When you were bullied,

177
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,280
I beat that man up.

178
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,350
You agreed to be someone’s date,

179
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:58,660
so I asked you to serve the wine.

180
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,710
This is the first time in my life I learn

181
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,670
what jealousy and possessiveness are.

182
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,280
I wonder

183
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,110
what charm

184
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:15,150
in a person like you

185
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:17,470
that changes a man’s heart.

186
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,640
I hate to be influenced.

187
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:26,960
I hate the person who has influence on me.

188
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:31,710
So I hate it that you come into my sight

189
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,200
and distract me.

190
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,230
Tell me.

191
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:38,140
What should I do

192
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,270
to stop you from intervening my life?

193
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,460
What should I do

194
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:45,120
to stop myself from thinking about you?

195
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,110
The story of Tonghao and Ye Qianyu ended.

196
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,910
If I disturb your life,

197
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:58,960
I apologize.

198
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,640
I’ll disappear.

199
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,550
Ye Qianyu,

200
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:11,980
I didn’t know what love is

201
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,120
and what pain is until now.

202
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Now I finally believe

203
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,320
everything about Tonghao you mentioned is real.

204
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:20,520
In fact, when you put on the ring

205
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,880
and couldn’t take it off,

206
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,230
it was a tip from destiny.

207
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,440
Ye Qianyu and Shan Junhao

208
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:39,000
belong to two different worlds.

209
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,470
I don’t care.

210
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,790
Can you give me a chance?

211
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,200
You know what?

212
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,960
When Tonghao left,

213
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,470
how I wish you could say these words.

214
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,670
But you didn’t.

215
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,080
And now,

216
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:26,000
we both have our own lives.

217
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,320
And I’m trying to forget you gradually.

218
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,520
Let’s just take our different paths.

219
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,080
Isn’t that good?

220
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,230
No.

221
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,440
I don’t allow it.

222
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:57,000
In the banquet today,

223
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,350
when my mom and I

224
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:01,230
were watched by so many people,

225
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:05,070
I realized the gap between you and me.

226
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,680
If we had to choose to stay together,

227
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,680
it would hurt lots of people,

228
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,950
including you.

229
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,800
So,

230
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:22,310
I’ll take what happened today

231
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,800
never happened.

232
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,000
What happened is happened.

233
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,040
Why do you want to take it never happened?

234
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:35,160
The person I love is Tonghao.

235
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,590
Shan Junhao is Tonghao.

236
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,520
Don’t you ever

237
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:42,230
have the slightest feelings for Shan Junhao?

238
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,950
If you don’t,

239
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,900
why are you wearing this ring

240
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,530
all the time?

241
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,160
I can put this ring

242
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,070
on my finger,

243
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,640
so can I throw it away,

244
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,230
like the memory about you.

245
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,110
Why did you do it?

246
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,400
Junhao,

247
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,520
where have you been?

248
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,590
I need to talk to you.

249
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,880
It’s late.

250
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,400
Let’s talk tomorrow.

251
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,110
Yunyi,

252
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:08,470
I went to Guanmei Fishing Village.

253
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,590
Now,

254
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,680
you don’t even wanna lie to me?

255
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:24,800
I’m sorry, Yunyi.

256
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,640
In this period of time,

257
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:27,830
my behaviors

258
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,560
must have caused you a lot of trouble.

259
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,160
It’s because

260
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,430
I wasn’t clear about my affection.

261
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,110
If it goes on like this,

262
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:42,000
I could only bring you more pain.

263
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:44,880
I think

264
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,430
we should reconsider

265
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:50,000
the decision about our marriage.

266
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,310
Junhao.

267
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,160
What did you say?

268
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,680
I don’t agree.

269
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,710
Do you know what you’re doing?

270
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,310
Are you out of your mind?

271
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,520
I am not.

272
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:11,230
I know very clearly what I’m doing.

273
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:13,520
And clearly I know

274
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,070
what I want.

275
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,640
Did that girl

276
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,710
pester you again?

277
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:18,950
She didn’t pester me.

278
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,040
I’m pestering her.

279
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:23,590
Don’t forget

280
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,040
that you’re the General Manager of Senwell,

281
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,880
the only successor of Shan family,

282
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,800
and Fan Yunyi’s fiancé.

283
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,520
Is that a person

284
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,110
in your status should say?

285
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:31,800
Mom,

286
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,350
Yunyi and I grew up together.

287
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:37,590
You believe we should get married.

288
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:38,430
But,

289
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,040
I realized finally

290
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,400
that our relationship is of families, not lovers.

291
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:48,400
If I continue

292
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,070
the relationship with Yunyi,

293
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:52,160
it’ll be so unfair for her.

294
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:55,880
Yunyi should love and be loved.

295
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:58,710
That’s why you should marry her.

296
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:02,350
You should give her love and a happy life.

297
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:05,430
She grew up in our family.

298
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:07,800
She is the only choice for you,

299
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,880
and the best one.

300
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,230
Mom.

301
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,400
I can’t marry Yunyi.

302
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,230
Yunyi

303
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,040
will meet a man

304
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,520
who can give her love and happiness.

305
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,590
But that man

306
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,560
isn’t me.

307
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:37,470
Yunyi,

308
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:41,280
I’m sorry.

309
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,230
Darling.

310
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:00,470
Darling.

311
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,830
Mom.

312
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:04,280
Mom.

313
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,470
Why?

314
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:11,950
Why?

315
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,550
Mom.

316
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,800
It’s all right.

317
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:19,710
I know.

318
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:22,000
I… I understand.

319
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,400
Ye Qianyu,

320
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,470
I won’t give you up.

321
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,260
= Tonghao will take care of Ye Qianyu forever =

322
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,700
= Tonghao feeds Ye Qianyu =

323
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,900
= Tonghao washes clothes for Ye Qianyu =

324
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,400
Why didn’t you

325
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,040
wake me up when you came in the morning?

326
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:35,710
Because I wanted you to sleep a little longer.

327
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:38,280
It’s already a great favor

328
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,520
to pick me up after work.

329
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:41,190
You really don’t have to
pick me up in the morning.

330
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:44,640
It’s a privilege for someone in bad mood.

331
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:47,680
Qianyu,

332
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,280
I bought you breakfast.

333
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:50,400
Eat it warm.

334
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,430
You bought so little.

335
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:57,110
Have you ever considered my appetite?

336
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:02,680
It’s already for two.

337
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,000
Make it four next time. Thank you.

338
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:16,000
OK, I’ll get you breakfast for four.

339
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,160
Qianyu,

340
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,830
why don’t you wear

341
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:27,190
the necklace I gave you?

342
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,470
I threw it in the sea.

343
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:37,040
I really did.

344
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,350
You don’t regret it?

345
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,880
No.

346
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,280
Mom.

347
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,040
Junhao went to office in early morning.

348
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,000
Let’s have breakfast.

349
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:14,920
Yunyi,

350
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,760
don’t think too much.

351
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,310
Junhao didn’t have a clear mind.

352
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:21,920
He’ll get it through.

353
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,350
Since we were little,

354
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:28,680
Junhao has been an independent person.

355
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,350
I think when he said that,

356
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:36,760
he probably made up his mind.

357
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,000
Silly girl,

358
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,160
it’s far from a decision now.

359
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,680
Mom won’t allow

360
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,190
him to be with any other woman.

361
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,310
You know Junhao

362
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,800
is obedient to me.

363
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:52,710
He won’t go against my will.

364
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:55,590
It’s just

365
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:58,760
you need to give him some time

366
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:00,880
to cool down

367
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,950
and get it straight.

368
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,350
But I don’t know what to do

369
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,920
to make Junhao happy.

370
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,520
Maybe to him,

371
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,950
whatever I do is wrong.

372
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:24,350
Don’t go to work today.

373
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:27,000
Stay with me.

374
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:29,920
Let’s go shopping, buy things

375
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,760
and go to the cinema, OK?

376
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,040
Mom, it’s OK.

377
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,430
It takes two in love,

378
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:44,160
but one in my work.

379
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,110
Morning, Mr. Shan.

380
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:07,520
Mr. Shan,

381
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,430
do you come to give us some instructions?

382
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:11,040
No.

383
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,230
I want to check the status of our rooms.

384
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:15,350
Let me be your guide.

385
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,190
No, thanks.

386
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,470
I’ll go on my own.

387
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:18,430
Get on with your work.

388
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,710
Ye Qianyu.

389
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:49,000
It’s against personnel regulations

390
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,110
to ignore the General Manager.

391
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:56,760
Morning, Mr. Shan.

392
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,190
Morning.

393
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:07,110
Mr. Shan, is there anything else?

394
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:09,830
No.

395
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,920
I just want to inspect the rooms.

396
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,310
I’ll go to work.

397
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,160
Mr. Shan,

398
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:05,640
you don’t need to do that.

399
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,070
I can ask other cleaning staff to help.

400
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:11,280
As the General Manager,

401
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,080
it’s a plus to my image

402
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,540
to show kindness occasionally.

403
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,320
Ah.

404
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:22,170
Mr. Shan, I can do it. Leave it to me.

405
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:30,470
Director Fan.

406
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,760
Dawei, where is Mr. Shan?

407
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,160
Mr. Shan went to Senwell Hotel
in the early morning

408
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,160
to supervise their work.

409
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,110
Why didn’t you go?

410
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,160
Mr. Shan said he wanted to go alone

411
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,400
and to enhance communication with employees.

412
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,140
What?

413
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:00,590
Remember. Do it as early as possible…

414
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:01,920
Yunyi.

415
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,800
Mr. Shan,

416
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,230
don’t you have work to do?

417
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:21,760
Or do you worry about my work

418
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,280
that you have to supervise in person?

419
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,000
I…

420
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,040
Come to inspect the rooms.

421
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:37,680
Room inspection is a pivotal part

422
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,280
of the hotel management.

423
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,560
Because guests’ experience

424
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,680
determines the occupancy rate.

425
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,160
Senwell Hotel’s occupancy rate of this year

426
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,280
drops 20% compared with that of last year.

427
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,430
Despite of malicious competition,

428
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:54,830
I wonder what the problem is.

429
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:59,880
I don’t know anything about hotel management.

430
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:02,070
But Tonghao told me once

431
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,920
that the secret of running a hotel
lies in details.

432
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:07,230
Senwell Hotel is lavish in decoration.

433
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:09,310
But I think the smile on some employees’ faces

434
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,950
isn’t as bright as Fengqiao’s.

435
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:13,160
The smell in the air is great,

436
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,800
but not as fragrant as flowers in Guanmei Inn.

437
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:18,350
Towels in the room are soft,

438
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,830
but they’re too plain and neat
that lose the warmth of home.

439
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,110
Good point.

440
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,430
Really?

441
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:29,210
It seems Tonghao is a great teacher.

442
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,900
Mr. Tonghao is brilliant.

443
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,710
Mr. Shan,

444
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:36,710
why do you come today?

445
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:47,000
I want to give you another chance to regret.

446
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:48,070
What?

447
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,640
I think you must feel remorse yesterday

448
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,350
not to accept my feelings.

449
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:55,950
And as a girl,

450
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,520
you’re too shy to admit it.

451
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,880
So I’m right in front of you now

452
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,070
to give you another chance.

453
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,840
Cleaner on second floor!

454
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,280
Copy that.

455
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,750
A guest spilt drinks on the stairs.

456
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,200
Clean it up as soon as possible.

457
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,520
OK, copy that.

458
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,520
Mr. Shan,

459
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,230
I’ll give you a minute to admire yourself.

460
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:21,630
Bye-bye.

461
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,000
Ye Qianyu,

462
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,360
I never take back

463
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,800
what I said.

464
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:46,230
And I won’t give up

465
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,230
on the decision I made.

466
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,290
This is your card key. Here.

467
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,040
Director Fan.

468
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,120
Have you seen Mr. Shan?

469
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,150
Mr. Shan was here just now.

470
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:38,360
He went downstairs with a colleague

471
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,360
of the Cleaning Department.

472
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:47,560
Joey.

473
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,120
Mr. Shan,

474
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,430
what’s up?

475
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,520
Someone fell off from the stairs
on the second floor.

476
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,560
Fell off?

477
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:01,660
Let’s go.

478
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,420
All right.

479
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:21,420
= Operation Room =

480
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:41,280
Go take a seat.

481
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:44,950
What’s up?

482
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:46,800
Are you injured?

483
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,520
No, I’m fine.

484
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:55,840
Junhao.

485
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,190
How is Yunyi?

486
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:00,840
Doctors are saving her.

487
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,430
What was going on?

488
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:04,760
How could Yunyi fall off from the stairs

489
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,870
in the hotel?

490
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:09,430
I’m sorry.

491
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:12,000
I was mopping the floor.

492
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:13,470
It was slippery,

493
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,800
which led to Director Fan’s fall.

494
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,560
I’m sorry.

495
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:30,190
If anything happens to my daughter,

496
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,000
I will let you pay the price.

497
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,120
Mom,

498
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:41,710
it’s just an accident.

499
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:43,120
Don’t you see the situation here?

500
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,600
How could you speak for her?

501
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:52,560
Mom, calm down.

502
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,320
Ye Qianyu,

503
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,950
Junhao and Yunyi is about to get married.

504
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,150
I warn you.

505
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:05,870
Stay away from them!

506
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:10,120
Don’t ever get in my sight!

507
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,190
Get out!

508
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,430
I’m sorry.

509
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:23,710
- Yunyi! - Yunyi.

510
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:25,230
- Yunyi. - Yunyi.

511
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:28,120
Doctor, how is my daughter?

512
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,840
Her head was hit badly

513
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,840
which leads to coma

514
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,040
and severe concussion.

515
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:35,280
But these aren’t dangerous.

516
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,520
What’s dangerous is

517
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,120
that intracerebral hematoma is found

518
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:40,430
and oppresses the optic nerve.

519
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:49,040
Yunyi.

520
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,000
Yunyi, you’re awake.

521
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,560
Yunyi.

522
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:56,800
Yunyi.

523
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:59,760
You’re awake. How do you feel?

524
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:00,600
Mom.

525
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:01,710
I’m here.

526
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:02,830
- Mom. - I’m here.

527
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,800
Mom is here.

528
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:08,000
My eyes.

529
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:09,190
Eyes?

530
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,520
What’s wrong with them?

531
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,080
I can’t see anything.

532
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:21,840
Mom.

533
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,280
What…

534
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:26,870
What’s going on?

535
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:28,360
This is the consequence

536
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,230
when intracerebral hematoma
oppresses the optic nerve.

537
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:33,870
Loss of vision.

538
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,910
Loss of vision?

539
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,080
Mom.

540
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:45,120
If the clot can dissolve itself,

541
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,120
as the pressure on optic nerve is relieved,

542
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,910
she can regain her vision.

543
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,560
But if the clot stays,

544
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,040
we suggest

545
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,870
a surgery to remove it.

546
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:02,390
It’s OK.

547
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:03,520
What should I do?

548
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,120
You heard the doctor.

549
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,040
He said

550
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,430
it’s only temporary…

551
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:08,600
Temporary loss of vision.

552
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,670
What should we do?

553
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,480
Cheer up. It’s OK.

554
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:12,990
- It’s OK. - Mom.

555
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,210
Yunyi.

556
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:17,740
Mom.

557
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Where is Junhao?

558
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,520
He’s here.

559
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:21,470
He’s here.

560
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:23,320
Junhao.

561
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:26,600
Junhao.

562
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,430
You’ll be fine.

563
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:35,430
Mom.

564
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,560
It’s gonna be fine.

565
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:40,430
You’re OK.

566
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,600
Qianyu.

567
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:08,040
Taichu.

568
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:11,430
Is your hand OK?

569
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,840
Yes.

570
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,600
Let me see.

571
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,430
It’s severe.

572
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:18,520
Let me take you to the doctor.

573
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:20,190
- I’m fine. - Let’s go.

574
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,320
Tell the hotel manager to fire Ye Qianyu.

575
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,230
Mom,

576
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,190
I told you it was an accident.

577
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:29,600
I don’t care if it was an accident or not,

578
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,600
I don’t want to see her again.

579
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,390
I won’t fire her.

580
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,760
What’s wrong with you now?

581
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:44,840
You weren’t like this before.

582
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,230
You were obedient.

583
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,470
Now you go against my will more than once

584
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:50,190
for that girl.

585
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,520
Is Ye Qianyu more important than Yunyi

586
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,080
or the company?

587
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,360
You…

588
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:03,760
Junhao.

589
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:11,080
Is Ye Qianyu

590
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:15,190
more important than Yunyi in your eyes?

591
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:33,760
Qianyu, are you alright?

592
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,840
Now you remember to care about Qianyu.

593
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,080
Don’t you think it’s too late?

594
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,800
Taichu, we should go.

595
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:49,870
Qianyu…

596
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:52,670
If you can’t take care of Yunyi,

597
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,160
please let her go.

598
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:18,800
Thank you.

599
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,430
Qianyu,

600
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,630
stay in my home for a few days.

601
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,430
Or Mama Jinzhi would be worried

602
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:28,520
if she found you injured.

603
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,710
I’ve called her.

604
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:32,910
Thank you, Taichu.

605
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,360
What’s this?

606
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:56,320
For you.

607
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,080
Thank you.

608
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:08,910
Put behind what you should let go.

609
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:10,910
Qianyu,

610
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:12,600

611
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,800
