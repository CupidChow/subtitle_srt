11
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,510
Mr. Zhang.

12
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,760
How are Mr. Qiu and Mr. Lin?

13
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:47,830
I visited them.

14
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:50,040
Knowing Shan Junhao wouldn’t back off,

15
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:51,680
they were in a foul mood.

16
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,510
What did the lawyer say?

17
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,160
He’s been trying

18
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,310
to reduce their sentences,

19
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,720
but getting acquitted is impossible.

20
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,720
That’s the consequence of their foolishness.

21
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,630
Not only have they lost their freedom,

22
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,520
but also their shares

23
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,960
to Shan Junhao.

24
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,600
They said if Shan Junhao

25
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,360
insisted on pressing charges,

26
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,160
they’d have to counterattack.

27
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,910
Those two are behind the bars.

28
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,630
What could they do?

29
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,160
They meant

30
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,240
Xu Ziqian could be used to destroy Shan Junhao.

31
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,390
Xu Ziqian?

32
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,030
Yes.

33
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,550
They told me

34
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:34,080
Xu Ziqian’s father Xu Yifeng

35
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,830
didn’t give his shares to Shan Yaolong willingly

36
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,830
but was forced to do so.

37
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,880
According to them, Chairman Xu and Shan Yaolong

38
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,670
never agreed on the business mode.

39
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,080
Chairman Xu was deceived by his friend

40
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:48,880
and lost his investment,

41
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,720
causing a huge disaster to Senwell

42
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,720
which almost buried it.

43
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,320
Then Shan Yaolong managed

44
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,910
to gain enough funds to save the company.

45
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,960
But only after Xu Yifeng resigned

46
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,910
would he inject the money into Senwell.

47
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,000
How did Mr. Qiu and Mr. Lin

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,440
learn about that?

49
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,030
They weren’t

50
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:09,600
even in Senwell

51
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,160
when the shareholding was changed.

52
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,030
Since they were in jail,

53
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,390
they’ve been holding a grudge against Shan Junhao

54
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:16,830
and have been looking for ways

55
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,320
to get back at him.

56
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,880
Eventually, they dug that up.

57
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:27,960
They’ve decided to marry?

58
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,310
Yeah.

59
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,160
Now that Junhao is back,

60
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,000
and the company is also back on track,

61
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,800
it’s time to consider their marriage.

62
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,720
They’ve both agreed on that.

63
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,550
I invited you here

64
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,520
to discuss those things

65
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,320
with you.

66
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,030
Let them decide.

67
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,670
You’re back.

68
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:57,520
Ziqian and I are discussing your wedding.

69
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:06,720
How do things in Guanmei go?

70
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,800
I’ve ordered them to move out soon.

71
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:12,670
Well,

72
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,470
I think

73
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,780
- Guanmei shouldn’t... - Boys,

74
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:18,510
leave your business talk at work.

75
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,510
Since you’re all here,

76
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,320
let’s plan the wedding.

77
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,180
Mom.

78
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,350
You can decide for us.

79
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,480
We have no objections.

80
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,390
Congrats.

81
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,530
Thanks.

82
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,880
Shan Junhao is right.

83
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,600
Hard work isn’t enough.

84
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,200
I’m too incapable.

85
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,600
Don’t blame yourself.

86
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,070
You’ve done well enough.

87
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,070
Taichu.

88
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,950
Why didn’t you tell me

89
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,480
what you were really here for?

90
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,480
Professionally speaking,

91
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:56,920
I’m an observer.

92
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,670
I want to see things as they are.

93
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,000
If you knew about my identity,

94
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,270
things would be different.

95
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,480
Sadly, it’s still too late.

96
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,070
We still can’t change the result

97
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,270
despite all our efforts.

98
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,070
Don’t be too sad.

99
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,200
Things might turn.

100
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:24,830
Taichu.

101
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,550
Thank you for everything you did for us.

102
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,830
I’ll do my best to protect Guanmei.

104
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:03,640
Stop.

105
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,270
Why are you here again?

106
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,440
It’s been a week.

107
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,110
We’re here to shut down Guanmei Inn.

108
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,110
Take all your personal belongings and leave.

109
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,480
How could you do this?

110
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,550
Leave.

111
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,550
We don’t welcome

112
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,760
members of Senwell here.

Boss.

114
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:26,230
They’re ordering us to leave.

115
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,760
Go pack up.

116
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,110
Guanmei Inn

117
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,320
no longer belongs to us.

118
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:38,720
- Tang. - Boss.

119
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,110
You’re giving up already?

120
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,070
I’m sorry.

121
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:41,640
Boss.

122
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,440
- Boss. - Boss.

123
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,390
Everyone,

124
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,390
we’re executing the contract

125
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,390
according to the law.

126
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,320
Dawei,

127
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,550
can you persuade Shan Junhao

128
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,110
to let us stay?

129
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:54,510
I’m sorry.

130
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,390
My hands are tied.

131
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,510
Log all items.

132
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:18,390
Taichu.

133
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:18,950
What’s up?

134
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:21,950
What?

135
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,760
I’ll contact you once it’s all finished.

137
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,960
What should we do?

138
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,590
This belongs to the inn.

139
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,350
I always use this spoon

140
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,590
for my afternoon tea.

141
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,150
Can you return it to me?

142
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,110
No.

143
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,350
Don’t cry, Fengqiao.

144
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:34,880
Don’t cry. There, there.

145
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:40,640
This one

146
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,960
also belongs to Guanmei Inn.

147
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:46,520
This hanky has been with me for three years.

148
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,200
Please don’t take it away.

149
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,670
Sorry, you can’t keep it.

150
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,150
Mr. Song,

151
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:56,230
let them keep those small items.

152
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:57,520
No.

153
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,200
Other than their personal belongings,

154
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,440
they can’t take away

155
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,470
anything that belongs to the inn.

156
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,200
That’s Mr. Shan’s order.

157
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:13,670
Fine.

158
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,000
All finished.

159
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,160
I’m leaving.

160
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:16,810
Thank you.

161
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:17,440
OK.

162
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,520
Let’s go.

163
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,350
Goodness!

164
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:22,440
What should we do?

165
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,400
Mr. Tang, don’t be too sad.

166
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,080
And you guys.

167
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,150
We’re simply following orders.

168
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:39,790
How did it go?

169
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:40,960
Tell me.

170
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,760
Nothing we can do to stop it?

171
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:09,910
Just go back for now.

172
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,910
I’ll figure something out.

173
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:12,400
Yes.

174
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,670
Go back, guys.

175
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,880
We want to take one last look.

176
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,030
You go ahead.

177
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,150
Tang,

178
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,080
let’s go home.

179
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,500
It’s OK.

180
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,380
I’m leaving.

181
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,030
Bye, Liyin.

182
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,080
Actually...

183
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,080
You

184
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,670
beanpole.

185
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:56,700
Why are you still here?

186
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,180
Well, I...

187
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,110
- Leave. - Get lost.

188
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:00,760
Alright.

189
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,390
Let’s go.

190
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,590
Luckily, we have a back entrance.

191
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:35,880
- Bravo! - Good!

192
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,620
Let’s go.

193
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:37,790
Wait.

194
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,080
Once we get in,

195
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,960
if things are missing,

196
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,760
will they accuse us of stealing?

197
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:43,880
They won’t find out.

198
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:45,670
Stealing?

199
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,470
We aren’t stealing anything.

200
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:48,550
We’re taking them back.

201
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,670
We’re taking back

202
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:51,000
what belongs to us.

203
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,000
Yes. Exactly.

204
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,080
Come. Let’s do it, Master.

205
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:54,830
OK.

206
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:55,720
Ready.

207
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,440
One, two, three.

208
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:06,960
You first.

209
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,790
Sure. I’ll go.

210
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,400
Go.

211
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,400
What are you doing?

212
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,900
This is a nice place.

213
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:14,670
The sunlight is too strong.

214
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,140
- Look at that flower. - It’s scorching.

215
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,950
- Look how big the tree is. - It’s beautiful.

216
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:18,830
You guys...

217
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,080
And that tree...

218
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,350
Where... Where is he?

219
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,840
Where did he go?

220
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,470
Dig in, guys.

221
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:52,520
Usually, these dishes are only for guests.

222
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,550
We can’t afford

223
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,150
to eat such expensive food.

224
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,760
What plans do you have?

225
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,230
I thought I’d work for Guanmei Inn

226
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,520
for the rest of my life.

227
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,710
I’m too old.

228
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,960
What plan could I have?

229
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,150
Tang,

230
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,910
just stay with us.

231
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:18,520
I never thought

232
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,470
we’d be forced out of the inn.

233
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,470
Where’s Taichu?

234
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,110
Taichu!

235
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,880
Taichu!

236
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,030
Qianyu,

237
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,400
we have leverage to negotiate with Shan Junhao.

238
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,230
What is it?

239
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:39,760
I reviewed

240
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,760
the files closely.

241
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,080
The recent profit growth rate

242
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,110
has reached 300%.

243
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,000
Meaning what?

244
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,440
If we can grow at this rate

245
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,400
and upgrade the business mode,

246
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,200
Guanmei Inn will soon pick up.

247
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,610
But

248
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,670
Guanmei Inn has been sealed.

249
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,400
How can we continue to run it?

250
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,840
We can use these files

251
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,280
to negotiate with Shan Junhao.

252
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,710
Given the current profit progression,

253
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,550
the previous equity evaluation and transfer

254
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:03,230
weren’t reasonable.

255
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,740
Really?

256
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,520
Of course.

257
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,110
But before we go see him,

258
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,670
we must be fully prepared.

259
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,710
Other than completing a data report,

260
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:12,550
you all need to become

261
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:14,230
hotel management professionals.

262
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,390
Hey,

263
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,670
aren’t we professional enough?

264
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,640
Master.

265
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,400
With all due respect,

266
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,710
over the years,

267
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,320
Guanmei Inn has been like a family.

268
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,000
It’s warm.

269
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,790
You all get along well

270
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:27,440
but you lack knowledge of professional management.

271
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,150
What we need

272
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,440
is to run this place with expertise.

273
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,910
That’ll give us an advantage in the negotiation.

274
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:34,400
How can we become

275
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,000
professionals?

276
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,960
That’s where I come in.

277
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,230
My training will improve you quickly.

278
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,520
Can we make it?

279
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,670
Will it really work?

280
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,550
We must seize everyone possible chance

281
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:46,960
to save Guanmei Inn.

282
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,550
Then...

283
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,710
Then waste no time.

284
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:51,340
Let the training begin.

285
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,090
Sit with us.

286
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:52,860
- Yes. - OK.

287
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,630
- Come here. - Sit.

288
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,800
Let’s eat and discuss it.

289
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,400
I’ve designed about ten modules.

290
00:16:58,710 --> 00:16:59,230
First,

291
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:02,080
development and trends of hotels and tourism.

292
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,190
Understand the whole market

293
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,430
before adjusting ourselves.

294
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:07,070
Second, hotel management,

295
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:08,280
namely,

296
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,560
positioning and brand planning.

297
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:11,950
Third,

298
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,310
investment.

299
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,310
Based on an accurate value assessment,

300
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,310
look for reliable sources of investment.

301
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:17,830
About that,

302
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:19,710
I can offer you five million initial capitals.

303
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,280
Five million?

304
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,040
Fourth, hotel design and construction.

305
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:26,040
I’ll draft up

306
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,110
a proposal including all the items above soon.

307
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,760
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

308
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,680
What are you doing?

309
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,000
Nothing.

310
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,350
Nothing?

311
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:56,700
If so,

312
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,230
can you turn on the light?

313
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,520
I’m afraid of the darkness.

314
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:04,830
My bad.

315
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:05,590
I forgot.

316
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,590
Untie me now.

317
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,400
I can’t.

318
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,920
If I let you go,

319
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,000
you’ll probably tell Shan Junhao everything.

320
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:26,520
This is a crime.

321
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:30,540
We didn’t do anything.

322
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,350
You fell yourself,

323
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,560
remember?

324
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,440
Really?

325
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:37,680
Hey,

326
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,190
have some soup first.

327
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:50,830
Here.

328
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,560
I’ll feed you.

329
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:54,520
No.

330
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:55,950
What’s wrong?

331
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,950
What if it’s poisoned?

332
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,680
Why would I poison you?

333
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,920
Alright. How about this?

334
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,710
Just let me go.

335
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:07,920
I swear

336
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,920
I won’t tell anyone about this.

337
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,350
You know,

338
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,560
I sympathize with you.

339
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,070
I can’t call the shots.

340
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,430
Then ask someone who can to be here.

341
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,070
Can’t you be cooperative?

342
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,710
I’m trying to feed you soup. You want it or not?

343
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:24,680
I...

344
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,680
I’ll take it if you don’t.

345
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:38,950
Leave that wolfberry to me.

346
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:42,520
It’s good.

347
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,230
Your nose is bleeding.

348
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:54,070
It’s normal.

349
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:55,230
Really?

350
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:56,310
I’m leaving.

351
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,830
No, please stay.

352
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:03,230
Oh my! It is really drugged.

353
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,420
= Mr. Shan =

354
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:26,090
Hello?

355
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:27,390
Hello?

356
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,280
Dawei is supposed to be back from Guanmei.

357
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,590
Why didn’t he pick up?

358
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,160
Mr. Song said

359
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,040
he stayed to pacify those employees.

360
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:35,930
That’s probably why he’s late.

361
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:36,730
Pacify them?

362
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,710
Dawei is too sentimental.

363
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,810
Alright.

364
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,510
Let’s go home.

365
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,160
I’ll drive.

366
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:48,920
It’s OK.

367
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:51,000
Mr. Shan will call again.

368
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,280
Come on, boss.

369
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,160
No.

370
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,760
Anyone here?

371
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,830
Help!

372
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,590
Help!

373
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,360
Hey! Wake up.

374
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,830
Don’t scare me. I’m timid.

375
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,040
Don’t die.

376
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,760
Anyone here?

377
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:39,430
Someone died.

378
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,710
What’s Sheng doing?

379
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,520
What’s taking him so long

380
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,400
feeding the soup?

381
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:43,880
Yeah.

382
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:46,190
- Sheng! - Sheng!

383
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:47,390
Sheng!

384
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,160
Sheng!

385
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,050
Sheng!

386
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:50,160
Hey, hey, hello!

387
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,850
I’m also here.

388
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,680
- What did you do to him? - Sheng!

389
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,190
Sheng!

390
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,850
What did I do to him?

391
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,110
I meant to ask why you tried to poison me.

392
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:58,950
Poison you?

393
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,040
You’re thinking too much.

394
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,350
We’re broke.

395
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:03,520
We can’t afford to buy any poison.

396
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,400
Then why did his nose bleed and he die

397
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,000
after taking the soup?

398
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,680
He took that soup?

399
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:11,470
Sheng!

400
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:12,160
Sheng!

401
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,590
- Sheng! - Sheng!

402
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,950
- Sheng! Sheng! Sheng! - Sheng!

403
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:20,560
Sheng!

404
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,640
- Where am I? - Wake up. Open your eyes.

405
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,190
What’s wrong with you?

406
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,350
I told you

407
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:26,310
the turtle ginseng chicken soup wasn’t for you.

408
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,880
Why did you take it?

409
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,310
It was for him.

410
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,310
This guy...

411
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:37,040
This guy refused to have it,

412
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,040
so I took it.

413
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:41,520
You pig!

414
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:42,950
Go away.

415
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:45,640
Had we meant to harm you,

416
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,800
we would’ve done that

417
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,760
after you fainted.

418
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:48,800
Yes. Right.

419
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,070
You’re Li Dawei, right?

420
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,590
What’s wrong?

421
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,350
You look like a decent man.

422
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,070
But how come you hang out

423
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:57,710
with people like Shan Junhao?

424
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,760
You don’t know him.

425
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,590
Mr. Shan is a good man.

426
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:03,710
Good?

427
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:04,350
You didn’t see

428
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:05,590
how he treated us.

429
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:07,110
Had you witnessed his cruelty,

430
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,230
you wouldn’t have said that.

431
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,980
= Mr. Shan =

432
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,920
Reject it.

433
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,470
Reject it.

434
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:27,470
I’m sending your boss a text message.

435
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,760
Dear Mr. Shan,

436
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,830
I don’t feel well

437
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,560
and I’d like to take a few days off.

438
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,350
It won’t work.

439
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,310
I’m his special assistant.

440
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,950
I’m on standby 24/7.

441
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,560
I never rest.

442
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,620
= Denied =

443
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,070
Denied.

444
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:51,000
See?

445
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,350
See?

446
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,300
This is your boss.

447
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:56,640
He’s so inhuman

448
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,000
that he won’t let his man rest.

449
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:03,830
Dawei,

450
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,760
we won’t hurt you.

451
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,070
Untie me first.

452
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:07,830
Untie you?

453
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:09,040
No.

454
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:11,040
I have a proposal.

455
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:12,680
Look,

456
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:14,160
just take this as a vacation.

457
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,760
Not too bad.

458
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,280
I haven’t rested for long.

459
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,400
Guanmei Inn’s staff ask for a negotiation.

460
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:30,230
Negotiation?

461
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,430
They have nothing left.

462
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:34,280
What’s there to negotiate?

463
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,710
They’re already on the way.

464
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:39,160
Have you seen Li Dawei?

465
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,070
Dawei?

466
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:42,040
What’s wrong?

467
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:46,280
He texted me last night

468
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,280
and asked for a few days off.

469
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:49,470
I said no

470
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,070
and haven’t seen him since I came.

471
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,160
Dawei

472
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:55,590
never did anything like this before.

473
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,160
Hold on. Let me call him again.

474
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,540
= Li Dawei =

475
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,920
The subscriber you dialed is busy.

476
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,430
Please try again later.

477
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,800
No answer again.

478
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,190
What is he doing?

479
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:14,110
Forget it. Never mind.

480
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:15,160
Then...

481
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:15,710
Mr. Shan,

482
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:18,190
are you going to meet with them?

483
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,350
Let’s go

484
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:23,920
and see what game they’re playing.

485
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:28,070
Either make it or break it.

486
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,920
It all depends on us.

487
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,070
We’ll succeed.

488
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:33,850
Wait.

489
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I’m nervous.

490
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,230
I want to pee.

491
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:39,560
Sheng,

492
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,230
you’ve gone to the bathroom seven times.

493
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,520
Do you have a nervous bladder?

494
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:43,760
I think so.

495
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,640
If Tonghao,

496
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,470
no, if that Shan Junhao

497
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,310
refuses to agree to our condition,

498
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,000
he’ll have to

499
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,070
seal me, too.

500
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,550
Anyway,

501
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:55,110
I’m part of Guanmei Inn.

502
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,640
Master.

503
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,040
Taichu told us

504
00:26:58,430 --> 00:26:59,830
to convince him by reasoning.

505
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:02,430
With our brand-new professional attitude,

506
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:04,040
we’ll conquer Shan Junhao.

507
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:09,880
Don’t be scared.

508
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:10,710
Go,

509
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:11,950
Guanmei!

510
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,260
This way, please.

511
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,380
This room is huge!

512
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,950
It must be expensive.

513
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,830
It’s so soft.

514
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,710
Sheng. Fengqiao.

515
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:43,160
It’s luxurious.

516
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,680
Don’t break it.

517
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,820
This place is magnificent.

518
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:47,940
It’s their boss’s seat.

519
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,640
Please have a seat.

520
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,640
So comfy.

521
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:28,860
Be serious.

522
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:29,280
OK.

523
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:47,280
I see you have some manners.

524
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,500
But a seemingly nice shell

525
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:52,350
can’t cover

526
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:54,160
your ugly nature.

527
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,710
What do you want to say?

528
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,710
I don’t have a whole day.

529
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:01,160
Tang.

530
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,590
Mr. Shan,

531
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,350
this is the recent earnings report of Guanmei Inn.

532
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:12,070
= Guanmei Inn Daily Revenue Report (July) =
The profit growth rate

533
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:13,640
= Guanmei Inn Daily Revenue Report (July) =
has reached 300%.

534
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:14,640
According to the agreement,

535
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,760
Senwell is supposed to purchase Guanmei Inn

536
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,000
based on the new valuation,

537
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:19,800
or it’ll be considered a hostile takeover.

538
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:25,880
You want more money, don’t you?

539
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,110
Ye Qianyu.

540
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,280
Senwell didn’t purchase

541
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,710
Guanmei Inn.

542
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:34,470
Mr. Tang mortgaged his shares

543
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:35,880
to Senwell long ago.

544
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,880
He failed to return the money on time,

545
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,880
so his shares belong to Senwell.

546
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:42,310
We only offered you compensation

547
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,880
out of sympathy and kindness.

548
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,830
Yet you’re here to bargain with us?

549
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,180
I apologize.

550
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,760
She said it improperly.

551
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:54,800
Anyway,

552
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,470
the value of Guanmei Inn

553
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:58,830
already exceeds the number on the loan agreement.

554
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:00,710
Hence, the purchase

555
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:01,310
is unreasonable.

556
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,070
We aren’t here

557
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:04,760
for money

558
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:07,680
but to seek win-win cooperation with Senwell.

559
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,880
You losers

560
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,560
are proposing win-win cooperation?

561
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:17,070
You have the ownership of the inn,

562
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:18,560
but do you know

563
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,110
how to run it better

564
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,430
without pulling it down?

565
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:23,760
I admit

566
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,590
that you’re professionals

567
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:26,830
in hotel management,

568
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,560
but we know Guanmei the best.

569
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:30,710
If

570
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,190
you can let us

571
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:33,000
run the inn,

572
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:35,190
then both sides will win.

573
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,920
You surprised me, Ye Qianyu.

574
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,520
A swindler like you ripping money off customers

575
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,640
is proposing such a deal.

576
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,220
Mr. Shan,

577
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,760
not everyone can be a swindler.

578
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,520
You need skills

579
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,350
to convince people to pay.

580
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:01,560
Basically,

581
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:03,310
it’s similar to running a hotel.

582
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,110
You think

583
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,880
our high-end hotels

584
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,040
all over the world

585
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,280
make profits by cheating?

586
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,680
That’s not what I mean.

587
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,520
Director Fan,

588
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,350
we’re fully aware

589
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:18,110
of our shortcomings,

590
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,830
but that doesn’t make us less professional.

591
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:23,040
Tang.

592
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,800
I drafted this new proposal for Guanmei Inn.

593
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,520
I’m sure you’ll be interested.

594
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:32,680
You think by barging in

595
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,640
to negotiate with us,

596
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,230
you’ll have the inn back?

597
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,260
Mr. Shan,

598
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,040
100 years ago,

599
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,950
Guanmei Fishing Village was a business hub

600
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:44,160
and it provided supplies to all passing ships.

601
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:47,560
Although it’s in decline now,

602
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,920
it still bears historical marks.

603
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:51,710
What we need to do

604
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,710
is to keep its legacy

605
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,430
while improving it,

606
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,880
making it

607
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,760
a perfect and convenient tourist spot.

608
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,350
Let me put it this way.

609
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,230
If you level Guanmei Inn

610
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:08,950
to build an underwater hotel

611
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:10,860
or a resort with luxurious villas,

612
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:11,540
= Guanmei Inn Joint Operation Proposal =

613
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:13,310
that’ll completely destroy

614
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:16,070
the uniqueness of Guanmei.

615
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:18,950
A successful travel destination

616
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,350
should give tourists

617
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:21,950
unforgettable memories.

618
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,640
If they only want to swim in an infinity pool

619
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,560
or to take a sunbath on the lawn,

620
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:28,830
they can go to millions of other places.

621
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:30,670
Indeed.

622
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:32,920
We never intend to make Guanmei Inn

623
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,310
a five-star hotel

624
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:36,000
because it doesn’t fit to be one.

625
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,040
There are 23 five-star hotels

626
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,110
near Guanmei Fishing Village.

627
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,830
They’ve been worrying

628
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,560
about the falling occupancy already.

629
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:45,590
How could we compete with them?

630
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,950
Currently, the revenue of traditional hotels

631
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:50,350
is falling at a rate of 16.77%.

632
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,230
Whereas 86.93%

633
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:53,230
of the high-income earners

634
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,640
prefer nature-friendly and tranquil experiences.

635
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,110
That’s why

636
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:59,230
B&B has been soaring in recent years.

637
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:02,430
Within a 20-kilometer radius around Guanmei,

638
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,110
B&Bs are less than three.

639
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:06,520
They all have a six-month

640
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,160
waiting list for rooms.

641
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,800
That’s our chance.

642
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,400
Our profit growth rate

643
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,710
has been increased to 300% in a month.

644
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:15,830
That’s the best proof.

645
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:17,680
It works for Guanmei Inn.

646
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,590
Contents including redecoration,

647
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:20,520
marketing strategies,

648
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,400
development plans,

649
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,760
as well as the schedule,

650
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,310
liaison and work arrangement

651
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,000
are all explained in detail

652
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,190
in the proposal.

653
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,160
Sources of our data are in the appendix

654
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,350
for you to confirm.

655
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,400
Mr. Shan,

656
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,000
all you need to do

657
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:36,400
is to give us three months

658
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,470
to prove ourselves.

659
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,920
After that,

660
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:41,350
if you still want the inn back,

661
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,680
we’ll have no objections.

662
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,230
The proposal is great.

663
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:55,460
- Thanks. - Thank you.

664
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,910
Hope my 16.5 minutes

665
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:16,470
won’t be in vain.

666
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,420
Junhao...

667
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,300
So,

668
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,280
you’ve agreed to give us three months?

669
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:24,230
No.

670
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,420
One month.

671
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,760
Show me results in one month.

672
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:34,670
That’s enough.

673
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:37,230
Look, it’s doable.

674
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,430
Thank you for giving us this chance.

675
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:44,820
Taichu.

676
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,800
You taught them well.

677
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,560
Someone else

678
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,520
taught Qianyu negotiation skills before me.

679
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:53,670
It was Tonghao.

680
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,050
Dismissed.

681
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,660
- Come here. - Come.

682
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:26,800
Now we have time.

683
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:28,120
- Here. - Here.

684
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:28,650
Here.

685
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:31,540
- Cheers! - Cheers!

686
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,380
Junhao.

687
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:38,040
Why did you grant their request?

688
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:41,670
Their plan

689
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,260
matches GQ Ventures’ previous vision perfectly.

690
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:46,340
If we can meet their demand

691
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,260
for free,

692
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:49,520
and they have a complete

693
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,560
profit model,

694
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,710
why don’t we let them try it?

695
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,020
But...

696
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,630
But you said you’d never compromise.

697
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,510
I didn’t.

698
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,430
This is to develop potential needs.

699
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,460
Yes.

700
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:05,560
I read their proposal.

701
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:06,600
It’s thorough

702
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:07,760
and worth a shot.

703
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:25,870
Yunyi,

704
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,310
this is just work.

705
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,520
No need to worry.

706
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,220
I hope so.

707
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:49,280
What do you want now?

708
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,470
I’m sorry.

709
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:54,760
You must be tired.

710
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:55,260
Are you alright?

711
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,620
- Let me untie you. - Your legs must be numb.

712
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,520
I’m so sorry. I’ll free you now.

713
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,320
- You’re fine now. - Sorry about this.

714
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,440
- Here. - We’re really sorry.

715
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,520
Come here. Slowly, slowly.

716
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,230
How do you feel? Is your body sore?

717
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:06,840
Dawei,

718
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,320
we have good news for you.

719
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,040
Your boss has agreed to let us

720
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,190
continue running this inn.

721
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:12,910
Really?

722
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:13,600
Yes.

723
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:14,630
I told you

724
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:16,230
Mr. Shan is a good man.

725
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,580
= Mr. Shan =

726
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:23,040
Dawei.

727
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,190
Mr. Shan.

728
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:25,320
Don’t answer it.

729
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,910
If Shan Junhao knows we kidnapped you,

730
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:27,950
we’ll have serious trouble.

731
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,150
Hey, Master, did you hang up?

732
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,580
Hello?

733
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:37,470
That was scary!

734
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:38,380
= Mr. Shan =

735
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:43,020
Forget about it.

736
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:56,920
Don’t answer the call.

737
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,520
But you...

738
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,570
Are you hungry?

739
00:37:59,100 --> 00:37:59,880
Yeah.

740
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,800
- You are? - You’re hungry?

741
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,540
- Let’s go to eat. - Let’s go.

742
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:02,340
- Let’s go to eat. - Is the food ready?

743
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,660
- Let’s go. - Really?

744
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,050
This way.

745
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,560
We did it!

746
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,630
Thank you, Taichu.

747
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:13,760
Without you,

748
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,470
we wouldn’t be able to convince Shan Junhao.

749
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:17,760
Taichu.

750
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,950
You’ve done so much for us.

751
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,150
I don’t know how to repay you.

752
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:23,910
I want nothing else

753
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,080
other than seeing Guanmei Inn booming.

754
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,260
Mr. Shan.

755
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,040
What brings you here?

756
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,100
Ye Qianyu.

757
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,670
I thought you had changed

758
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:43,670
but you kidnapped my assistant!

759
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,390
I kidnapped your assistant?

760
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,870
What are you talking about?

761
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:50,910
Where is Dawei?

762
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,430
The last time I saw him

763
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:55,040
was when the inn was closed.

764
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:59,360
Someone abducted Dawei?

765
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,180
Eight Bamboos.

766
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,060
Chow.

767
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:06,150
East Wind.

768
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,380
Eight Circles.

769
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:10,950
Dawei,

770
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:13,280
look how fantastic our life here is.

771
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,960
Why don’t you stay with us?

772
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,880
Don’t leave.

773
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,100
Three Characters.

774
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:17,760
I wish I could

775
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,870
but I work for Mr. Shan.

776
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:22,410
Five Circles.

777
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,470
Why haven’t Qianyu and the others come?

778
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:27,520
Aren’t we supposed to unseal the inn?

779
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,000
Dawei, don’t leave.

780
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,910
Stay and play mahjong with us.

781
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:32,940
Nine Bamboos.

782
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,000
I won!

783
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:46,600
Pay up. Pay up.

784
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:48,190
You’re a mahjong genius!

785
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:48,950
Pay up.

786
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,520
We lost again.

787
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,910
Come on. Give me the money.

788
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,250
- Here. - Pay up.

789
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:00,240
Here you are. Take it.

790
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,630
It’s peanuts.

791
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,710
Li Dawei!

792
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,180
Mr. Shan.

793
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:21,320
What are you doing here?

794
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:27,820
Are you hungry?

795
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,190
Mr. Shan.

796
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,520
They didn’t abduct me.

797
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,870
I fell and fainted by accident.

798
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:56,840
Mr. Shan.

799
00:40:57,470 --> 00:40:58,560
It’s all my fault.

800
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,390
I told him not to answer your calls.

801
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,910
It was my idea.

802
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:03,950
They didn’t do anything.

803
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:04,870
It’s my fault.

804
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:06,840
I kept him here.

805
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,370
Mr. Shan.

806
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,390
Don’t listen to them.

807
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:13,080
Blame me.

808
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,430
I’m sorry.

809
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:15,760
I’m really sorry.

810
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:17,800
Please don’t take back

811
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,910
your promise.

812
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:19,600
Enough!

813
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:28,840
While you asked to negotiate with me,

814
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,120
you kidnapped my employee behind my back.

815
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,540
Mr. Shan.

816
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,470
I’ll take full responsibility

817
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,800
but Guanmei Inn

818
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,320
has nothing to do with it.

819
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,150
Shan Junhao,

820
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,630
what are you doing?

821
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,560
Tonghao...

822
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:26,000
Don’t give me that look again.

823
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:31,260
I’m not Tonghao.

824
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:14,220
Ye Qianyu.

825
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:16,190
You only have one month.

826
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:25,300
Mr. Shan. Mr. Shan.

827
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:26,500
Mr. Shan!

828
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,220
Dawei,

829
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:27,870
call us.

830
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:28,520
Yeah.

831
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:29,470
Come anytime.

832
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:30,710
Mr. Shan.

833
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:31,800
