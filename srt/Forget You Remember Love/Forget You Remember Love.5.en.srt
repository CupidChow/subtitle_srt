Cabriolet guy,

14
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,810
young man should eat sea cucumbers more.

15
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,290
It’s good for health.

16
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,240
Ye Qianyu, restrain yourself!

17
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,990
Chen, you should restrain yourself.

18
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:03,580
You eat the rice!

19
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,320
Eat the vegetables!

20
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,980
Chen, I want to eat the sea cucumber, too.

21
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:11,180
Eat the vegetables!

22
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,040
Eat the vegetables!

23
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,240
Tonghao,

24
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,090
how did you find us today?

25
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,790
Have some more.

26
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,300
Mama Jinzhi said

27
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,130
it was dangerous there.

28
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,630
And I saw the research you made.

29
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,250
So I headed your direction.

30
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:30,580
Thank you, Tonghao.

31
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,210
You’re welcome.

32
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:33,100
But don’t ever

33
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,170
take Qianyu to someplace so dangerous.

34
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,300
What’s it with you where Taichu and I go?

35
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,090
Eat the vegetables!

36
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,530
In fact, I find Dolphin Island

37
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:44,890
is a fantastic place.

38
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,670
It’s not as horrible as the legend describes.

39
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:50,490
However,

40
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,100
I heard Senwell

41
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,020
would renovate it into a resort.

42
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:55,940
If they do,

43
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,080
it won’t be so much fun.

44
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,650
You’re different from others.

45
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:01,810
When they go there,

46
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,490
they just take photos.

47
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,560
But you go to learn the history of the village.

48
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,760
Are you

49
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,610
a rich successor travelling around anonymously?

50
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,020
I’m just used to find out

51
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,490
everything about each place I go.

52
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,560
How insightful!

53
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,390
What have you found out in the last few days?

54
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,480
This is a very nice fishing village.

55
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,760
But it can be better.

56
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,330
How can we make it better?

57
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,410
Do you also believe it’ll be better once Senwell

58
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,150
makes Guanmei Fishing Village

59
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,010
the backyard of the rich?

60
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,650
That’s not what I mean.

61
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,160
I’m just saying

62
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,780
we should be more open

63
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,700
to changes.

64
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,760
I agree.

65
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,570
I give it my full support.

66
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,940
What’s the point keeping the shabby village?

67
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,860
The money Senwell offers

68
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,670
is quite a lot.

69
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:56,880
Miss Chen Jinzhi,

70
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,320
this is your home.

71
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,290
Your family is your home.

72
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,840
Home isn’t a house.

73
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,170
Make a home wherever you wish with the money.

74
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,660
Qianyu,

75
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,760
what is Senwell?

76
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,140
Senwell is a company

77
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,510
that harbors evil intentions.

78
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,140
How I wish to dig out its boss’s heart

79
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,030
and see if it’s black!

80
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:25,590
Tonghao,

81
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:27,200
you eat too much!

82
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,370
This is your third bowl.

83
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,980
Taichu hasn’t finished his first.

84
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,290
Cabriolet guy,

85
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,220
how could we let you wash dishes?

86
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,190
Oh, no!

87
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:47,870
It’s late.

88
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,360
Go back to hotel and rest.

89
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,680
OK.

90
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,100
I’m going back now.

91
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,160
OK.

92
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:55,860
See you.

93
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,150
Bye-bye! Bye-bye!

94
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,170
What are you looking at?

95
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,010
You do the dishes today.

96
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,050
Chen,

97
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,520
I’ve done the dishes for a month.

98
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:18,890
Look,

99
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,580
if I do the dishes with my tender hands,

100
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,290
how could I be able to marry a rich man?

101
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,610
None of your nonsense.

102
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,570
You had case-dough.

103
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:31,850
It’s because you gave us too little.

104
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,990
Right, Shengzhe?

105
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:33,860
Yes.

106
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,420
Gosh, you guys!

107
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,050
One more word and I’ll deduct your money.

108
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,420
Well, I’ll do it.

109
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:43,360
Good man!

110
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:44,460
Go ahead.

111
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,240
Look.

112
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,550
Today, I asked Tonghao to find you.

113
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,370
I thought he wouldn’t come back.

114
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,260
In that case, we could

115
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,180
get rid of the hot potato easily.

116
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,380
Unexpectedly,

117
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,450
he came back with you.

118
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,740
Chen,

119
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,810
he lost his memory because of us.

120
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,170
Would it be too cruel to abandon him?

121
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,500
But, what should we do about him?

122
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,250
We can’t raise him.

123
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,800
Look how much he eats. You got a rival.

124
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,910
We’re short of a guy in the grocery, right?

125
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,090
Why don’t we let him work for us,

126
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,250
as a free labor?

127
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,710
Right. He can teach me Rubik’s Cube.

128
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:33,050
You’re so short-sighted.

129
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,410
Truth will come to light.

130
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,170
He has to go as soon as possible.

131
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,810
Moreover, I can’t afford him.

132
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:52,340
How could you

133
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,370
keep the water running while doing dishes?

134
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,260
The water bill is high.

135
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,090
Goodness!

136
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:01,500
Gosh, how many detergents have you used?

137
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,570
A few will do. You wasted half a bottle.

138
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,340
That’s all money. Money!

139
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,910
Step aside. Go!

140
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:10,100
Bummer!

141
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,290
Go!

Go home with Aunt Jiang.

160

that their general manager, Shan Junhao,

161
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:33,180
went abroad for a secret research
of a key project.

162

It’s said, for the research,

163

Mr. Shan Junhao

164
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,380
even cancelled his engagement ceremony.

165
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,330
Mr. Shan is low-profile.

166
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,780
He never did a media interview.

167
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,860
But under his leadership, Senwell Group

168
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,020

Yesterday,

175
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,160
I met with GQ Ventures’ representatives.

176
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,430
They completely agreed on project proposal

00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,040

is the representative from ITA.

183
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:18,650
I’m trying to get in touch with him.

184

as far as I know, Mr. Wang from GQ Ventures

189
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,770
was unhappy about the shift of contact person.

190
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,090
After all, you’re just a director

191
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,990
and he’s the general manager.

192
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:37,780
Director Xu is appointed by Chairman Shan

193
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,890
to lead negotiation with GQ Ventures.

194
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:43,430
Chairman Shan and Mr. Wang’s father

195
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:44,860
have been friends for years.

196
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,140
And Mr. Wang values their friendship.

197
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,050
Isn’t the chairman in ICU?

198
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:53,840
He’s leading the group now?

199
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:57,870
Thank you for your concern, Mr. Zhang.

200
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,580
My father’s getting better.

201
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,800
Chairman Shan and Director Xu
are like father and son.

202
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,200
Naturally, Director Xu listens to

203
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,430
the chairman’s arrangement.

204
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:11,260
Do you have a problem with it, Mr. Zhang?

205
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:11,790
Not at all.

206
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:14,600
I just don’t think we should leave

207
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,190
the GM’s position vacant for long.

208
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:18,790
Mr. Shan used to travel

209
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,110
for a week or even a month.

210
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,850
It’s only been 5 or 6 days.

211
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:24,910
It’s not a very long time.

212
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,400
I don’t know what you’re hiding.

213
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,890
But I have patience.

214
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:35,550
Because truth will come to light sooner or later.

215
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,630
Board meeting is on Monday.

216
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,200
And let the board decide

217
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,510
on the alternative of GM.

218
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,290
That’ll be all.

219
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:49,290
By the way,

220
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:51,490
Director Xu,

221
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,130
you have no right to attend the meeting.

222
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:58,270
Neither do you, Miss Fan.

223
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:19,330
Yunyi,

224
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,240
why don’t you take a leave for a few days?

225
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,890
Don’t wear yourself out.

226
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,630
I have no right to rest.

227
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,230
I must complete

228
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:33,050
Junhao’s projects.

229
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:38,970
Where are you going?

230
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:13,540
The ring on your finger is so dazzling!

231
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,310
Do you remember anything?

232
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,430
It’s just the ring looks so familiar.

233
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,500
I think I saw it somewhere before.

234
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:32,930
Moreover,

235
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,830
it seems you don’t want me to see it.

236
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,920
This ring is mine.

237
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,570
You almost robbed it from me.

238
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:49,750
In the past, you didn’t just tell lies.

239
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,690
You also robbed things without any fear.

240
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,460
I don’t want you to see it

241
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,320
because I’m afraid you may rob it.

242
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,130
I’m that bad,

243
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,450
but you still let me stay.

244
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,420
Thank you.

245
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,690
It’s called rendering good for evil.

246
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:09,890
I don’t want to blame you.

247
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,150
If you’re grateful, work harder.

248
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:13,920
You may leave when you pay the debt.

249
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,360
Qianyu,

250
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:20,970
can you take me to places

251
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,760
you know that I’ve been to?

252
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,680
Maybe my memory will come back.

253
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,400
OK.

254
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,990
But my time is precious.

255
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,390
Come on. Get these to Granny Huazi.

256
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:38,210
OK.

257
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,320
Do your job.

258
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:44,880
What are you doing?

259
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,470
You haven’t finished your job.

260
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,030
Let me go with you,

261
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,420
so I can get on board your job.

262
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,550
Then I can help you

263
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:54,910
and you won’t have to work so hard.

264
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,400
All right.

265
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:04,140
Are you tired?

266
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,850
Let me drive.

267
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:08,810
You can drive?

268
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,240
It’s a stick shift car.

269
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,480
I think I can give it a try.

270
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:14,680
You sure?

271
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,100
Pull over.

272
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,020
Nice!

273
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,090
You have talent in almost everything.

274
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:45,670
From now on,

275
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,140
I can be your driver of your errands.

276
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:42,860
Here it is!

277
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,830
This is Devil Forest.

278
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:57,610
Let’s go.

279
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:19,890
Qianyu,

280
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:21,840
let me take it for you.

281
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,360
Good man!

282
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:27,990
Well, let me tell you.

283
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,740
I used to carry

284
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,870
way more than these.

285
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,330
And I carried them up the hill all by myself.

286
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:33,960
Let’s go.

287
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:35,660
Careful.

288
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,380
The view is great, isn’t it?

289
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:04,030
Come on.

290
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,660
Granny Huazi!

291
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:12,890
Granny Huazi!

292
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:14,990
This is Granny Huazi’s home.

293
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:16,770
Granny Huazi!

294
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,530
Qianyu.

295
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,240
Granny.

296
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:22,410
You come.

297
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,240
How are you doing?

298
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,410
Great!

299
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,430
Hi, Granny Huazi.

300
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:29,990
Who is this?

301
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:31,790
He’s Tonghao.

302
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:32,590
I found him.

303
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,530
You found him?

304
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,440
Then you’ve found a treasure.

305
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,040
It’s true I found him by the road.

306
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,560
But I think he’s dumb.

307
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,560
He can’t remember anything.

308
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:48,440
He looks like a clever kid to me.

309
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:53,470
Granny, predict my luck, please.

310
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,590
Have you met someone recently?

311
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:07,290
Yes, right.

312
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,450
He’s the one in your destiny.

313
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,330
Really?

314
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,440
However,

315
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,530
you’ll go through a lot.

316
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,990
It’s really him?

317
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,650
Who?

318
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,850
None of your business.

319
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:22,810
Tonghao,

320
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,110
you can also pick three shells.

321
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,290
When you make the picking,

322
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,160
focus on your wishes

323
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,350
and what you want to ask.

324
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,350
And then put them on the table.

325
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:48,280
You really don’t remember anything?

326
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:50,510
No, I don’t.

327
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,330
Without your previous memory,

328
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,190
your life starts anew.

329
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,470
You must be very happy now.

330
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:01,680
Hmm.

331
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:07,770
Perhaps,

332
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,160
it’s because God wants you to stop,

333
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,910
listen to voices around you

334
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,340
and feel the happiness and sorrow.

335
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,120
More importantly,

336
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:21,140
he wants you to feel your heart.

337
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,370
You should know

338
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,930
not all of us have such an opportunity.

339
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,690
People set their eyes on the remote

340
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,840
but they tend to ignore their own feelings.

341
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:35,580
Well,

342
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:37,830
you’re so lucky.

343
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:48,440
Qianyu,

344
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,200
do you like Taichu?

345
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,150
Taichu is great.

346
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:55,570
He meets all Mama Jinzhi’s

347
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,360
criteria for a son-in-law.

348
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,440
How could I dislike him?

349
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,700
Even Granny Huazi said

350
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,970
he’s the one I’m bound to meet.

351
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,030
Why do you ask?

352
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,470
Granny Huazi said

353
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:10,410
the one would appear.

354
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,170
It might not be him.

355
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:15,490
Not him? You think it’s you?

356
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,490
Don’t flatter yourself.

357
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:18,290
Let’s go home.

358
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:19,840
It’s getting dark.

359
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,320
Qianyu.

360
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:29,110
Tonghao!

361
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:54,840
Are you alright, Qianyu?

362
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:57,300
Are you a pig? You’re so heavy.

363
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,080
Get up.

364
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:03,910
What is it?

365
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,110
I think I hurt my foot.

366
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:07,750
Don’t move.

367
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,350
I think it’s OK.

368
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,290
No bone damage.

369
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,560
What should we do now?

370
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,490
Don’t worry.

371
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,950
We can call for help.

372
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,600
No signal here.

373
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,440
What now?

374
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:01,410
Seldom would people

375
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,190
come to Devil Forest.

376
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:04,760
Look, we don’t have any supply.

377
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,040
And no phone reception.

378
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:08,640
If we wait to be found,

379
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,050
we’ll become mummies in the end.

380
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,190
If I die,

381
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:15,200
what will happen to Shengzhe and Mama Jinzhi?

382
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,580
Am I going to leave all the debts

383
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:20,490
to Mama Jinzhi like my dad did?

384
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:22,800
Shengzhe is so little.

385
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,930
It’s gonna be fine. I’ll think of something.

386
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,460
I haven’t made enough money

387
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,140
or worn fashionable clothes,

388
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,670
or gone to karaoke,

389
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:33,260
or played in the amusement park,

390
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,500
or had a boyfriend.

391
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,950
And I’m going to die.

392
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:39,450
That’s so unfair.

393
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:43,620
God, why do you punish me so?

394
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:47,000
I’ve never done anything evil.

395
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:49,640
Promise me. Let me get out. I…

396
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,290
All right. We’ll be fine.

397
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:14,430
What are you doing?

398
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:15,970
I’m telling you.

399
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,610
Don’t take advantage of my vulnerability.

400
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,360
I have strong arms.

401
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,480
I could punch your teeth out.

402
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:27,570
What advantage is there to take?

403
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,120
What?

404
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:31,650
Do you have sight problems?

405
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,930
Not at all.

406
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,300
Show me then.

407
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,990
Go away. Stay away.

408
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,270
I’m kidding.

409
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:46,700
You aren’t so afraid now, right?

410
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:50,290
Kind of not so afraid.

411
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:54,710
But what should we do?

412
00:23:59,050 --> 00:23:59,740
All right.

413
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,360
Don’t think about that.

414
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:03,080
Let me see your foot.

415
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,990
Chen, did you make a fortune?

416
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:08,570
You cooked so many ribs.

417
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,360
All small ribs!

418
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:18,360
This is your sister’s favorite.

419
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:20,860
She works hard recently.

420
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,370
Wait until she’s back.

421
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:27,140
Mom, just one piece.

422
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:28,210
I’m hungry.

423
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,660
I’m starving.

424
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:32,020
Grandpa Li came to buy laundry detergent just now

425
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,320
but I didn’t have the strength to get it for him.

426
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:37,820
Mom, you’re the prettiest mom in the world,

427
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,750
the best mom ever.

428
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,760
I can’t believe you’re so beautiful.

429
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,010
One rib, OK?

430
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,590
OK. OK.

431
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:46,150
OK.

432
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,190
Just one piece.

433
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,250
OK.

434
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:51,860
It’s OK. I can massage on my own.

435
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,530
Don’t move.

436
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:55,960
You must lift your foot high

437
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,720
so that blood flows backward.

438
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,990
Otherwise, it would keep swelling up.

439
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,080
How are you going to do that alone?

440
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,320
Does it hurt?

441
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,320
Hang in there.

442
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,060
Do you feel better now?

443
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:47,230
I can’t believe your massage

444
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,450
is professional.

445
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:56,730
Come here. Turn around.

446
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:59,430
= Money Bag Grocery =

447
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:01,080
It’s dark.

448
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:04,180
Why hasn’t Qianyu come back?

449
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,000
Shengzhe,

450
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,160
call your sister now.

451
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:15,430
What’s up?

452
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,810
She didn’t answer.

453
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:19,850
Should we eat the ribs now?

454
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,250
Don’t you think your sister will be sad for that?

455
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,480
I wouldn’t get any when she comes back.

456
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,890
Call her! Again, right now!

457
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:45,740
It’s late.

458
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,170
Mama Jinzhi and Shengzhe

459
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:50,050
must worry about us so much.

460
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:54,910
Let’s check around the pit

461
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,250
tomorrow at dawn

462
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:58,570
and find a way out.

463
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:01,770
We don’t know if we could find one.

464
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,120
In fact, I don’t believe we could.

465
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,240
Let me tell you a story.

466
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,290
Once upon a time,

467
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,310
there was a drought-struck frog.

468
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:23,620
It dug up for water.

469
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:26,590
It kept digging.

470
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,880
However, in the end, it dug out a stone.

471
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,170
So it gave up.

472
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,670
Later, it died of thirst.

473
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,810
In fact, there’s a spring beneath the stone.

474
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:45,670
If it moved the stone away, water would flow out.

475
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:50,480
Therefore, don’t give up at crisis

476
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,710
and you’ll find hope in desperate situation.

477
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:03,000
Don’t give up at crisis

478
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,080
and you’ll find hope in desperate situation.

479
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:13,410
Tonghao, you’re good at great stories.

480
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,090
Trust me.

481
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,310
We’ll get out of here safe.

482
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,000
Look!

483
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,130
So many stars!

484
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,580
True. So many stars.

485
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:41,410
I never knew

486
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,170
the stars above Devil Forest

487
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,240
are so beautiful.

488
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:49,130
What’s your horoscopic sign?

489
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:50,440
Taurus.

490
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,110
Taurus…

491
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,240
Give me your hand.

492
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,060
Hold out a finger.

493
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,080
Look,

494
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,460
these five stars

495
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,340
form a triangle,

496
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:17,690
like a bull’s head.

497
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:20,170
That’s Taurus.

498
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:23,250
You can see it only at this season.

499
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:27,660
I saw it!

500
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:29,980
So that’s Taurus?

501
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,440
What about yours?

502
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,870
I don’t know.

503
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:49,650
Sorry about that.

504
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:53,420
It’s OK.

505
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:58,200
I can rewrite my life.

506
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:02,110
It’s an opportunity so many people can’t get.

507
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,630
From now on,

508
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:09,050
I’ll choose my birthday,

509
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,520
my horoscopic sign,

510
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,620
my friends,

511
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,780
and my families.

512
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:17,130
Qianyu,

513
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:21,680
you’re the first person I met
after I lost my memory.

514
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:24,230
You’re my friend,

515
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,180
my family,

516
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,300
and the most important person to me.

517
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:33,850
But…

518
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,230
Are you cold?

519
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:44,860
I’m trying to fight cold with my fat.

520
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:14,400
I’ll do everything I can to protect my friend

521
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:15,600
and my family.

522
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:55,010
Mom,

523
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,500
have something to eat.

524
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,970
Otherwise you’ll collapse.

525
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:08,570
I have no appetite.

526
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:17,530
It’s late. Who is it?

527
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,720
Mr. Ziqian.

528
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:22,360
Ziqian.

529
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:22,970
Yunyi.

530
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,280
Ziqian.

531
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,710
It’s late. What are you doing here?

532
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,490
I heard you had trouble sleeping.

533
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,750
So I bought you two sleeping lamps.

534
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,090
Thank you.

535
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:39,690
Thank you for what you did recently.

536
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:42,130
Don’t mention it, Aunt Jiang.

537
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:45,390
I’ll take care of the family and the company.

538
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:46,570
Don’t worry.

539
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:54,770
Don’t go back tonight.

540
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,170
It’s late. It’s tiresome to drive back.

541
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:01,650
I’ve been keeping your room for you.

542
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,250
Mrs. Lin often cleans up.

543
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:05,400
OK.

544
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:08,670
Let me install the lamps for you.

545
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:26,900
Mr. Ziqian,

546
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:28,530
I’ve made your bed.

547
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:29,860
You can go to sleep.

548
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,490
OK.

549
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:33,920
When they’re asleep, I’ll go to bed.

550
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:35,740
Good night.

551
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:38,200
OK.

552
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:39,470
I’ll leave you.

553
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,260
This insolent girl!

554
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,750
When you’re back, I’ll beat you up.

555
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:23,930
Jerk!

556
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:25,630
You took advantage of me while I was asleep.

557
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:27,970
Stay away from me.

558
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,990
I’m going to marry a rich man.

559
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:33,860
Please keep proper distance.

560
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,660
You hugged me last night.

561
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,290
You said you were cold and slept in my chest.

562
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:46,390
I couldn’t help but putting up with you.

563
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:49,100
I…

564
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,140
I just have bad habits in sleep.

565
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,130
From now on,

566
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:00,150
keep safe distance.

567
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,750
What should we do now?

568
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:29,130
I think there’s an exit.

569
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:30,960
Maybe it could lead us out.

570
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,010
Shall we have a look?

571
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:35,810
All right.

572
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:45,690
Give me a hand.

573
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:50,000
Didn’t you ask me to keep safe distance?

574
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:51,620
You…

575
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,750
Any candles?

576
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:05,970
Yes.

577
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:12,890
Watch out!

578
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:16,810
Careful.

579
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:28,050
Come on.

580
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:31,760
Be careful.

581
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:39,840
Look, there’s an exit.

582
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,100
True!

583
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,270
It’s so beautiful here!

584
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:17,410
Mama Jinzhi.

585
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,600
You’re going out?

586
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,560
Where is Qianyu?

587
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:21,440
Cabriolet guy,

588
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:23,290
Qianyu and Tonghao

589
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,540
went on a delivery errand to Granny Huazi’s.

590
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,980
But they didn’t come back all night.

591
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,140
They didn’t answer our calls.

592
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,940
There are plenty of pits in Devil Forest.

593
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,260
I’m afraid they’re in danger.

594
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,970
Shengzhe and I are going to find them.

595
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,740
Where is Devil Forest? I’ll go.

596
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:37,620
But you’re not familiar with it.

597
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,450
I can take him.

598
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,090
OK.

599
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:42,050
Mama Jinzhi, wait at home.

600
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,630
If Qianyu comes back, remember to tell me.

601
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:45,970
OK, OK.

602
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,010
Goodbye then.

603
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:49,820
Take care of yourselves.

604
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,420
OK.

605
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:08,730
What’s that?

606
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,250
It should be white dolphin.

607
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:16,430
Goodness!

608
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:19,250
There are white dolphins in our village!

609
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:26,170
Are you alright?

610
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,390
Get on my back.

611
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,470
Come on.

612
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:54,220
White dolphin, hi!

613
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,440
White dolphin!

614
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:57,560
White dolphin!

615
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:00,450
Hello!

616
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,250
Hello!

617
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,450
They’re gone.

618
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,600
Bye-bye!

619
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,270
Bye-bye!

620
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,360
Bye-bye!

621
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,130
Bye-bye!

622
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:21,280
Legends about Guanmei Fishing Village are real!

623
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,720
Shengzhe, come on.

624
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,130
Let’s go.

625
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:57,850
I think we can climb up here

626
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:00,250
and go back to Devil Forest.

627
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:03,040
It’s high and steep. How could we make it?

628
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,500
While it’s bright,

629
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,000
let’s go back to the pit

630
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,450
and see if we can climb out from there.

631
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:14,810
Let’s go.

632
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,740
Actually, you could leave me alone

633
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,880
and go home.

634
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:28,910
What did I tell you?

635
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:31,130
After I lost my memory,

636
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,180
you were the first person I met.

637
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,950
That makes you my friend, my family.

638
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:37,970
I’ll protect you.

639
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:40,350
No one would abandon his families.

640
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:41,050
Right?

641
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:49,320
Qianyu!

642
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:50,890
Big sister!

643
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:52,930
Qianyu! Where are you?

644
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:54,530
Big sister!

645
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:56,870
Qianyu!

646
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:59,000
Big sister!

647
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,610
Big sister!

648
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:09,250
Qianyu!

649
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,360
Big sister!

650
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,970
Qianyu! Where are you?

651
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:18,650
Qianyu!

652
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:19,640
Big sister!

653
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,730
Qianyu! Where are you?

654
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,280
Taichu!

655
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:27,210
Taichu comes to save us!

656
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,340
Big sister!

657
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,130
Qianyu!

658
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:30,090
Taichu!

659
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:32,730
Taichu!

660
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:36,210
Qianyu! Where are you?

661
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:38,890
Big sister!

662
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:41,100
Qianyu! Where are you?

663
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:41,890
Shengzhe!

664
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:43,130
Taichu!

665
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:44,840
Taichu!

666
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:45,550
Shengzhe!

667
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:46,540
Taichu!

668
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,450
We’re here!

669
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,090
Big sister!

670
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:51,130
- Qianyu! - Shengzhe!

671
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:53,200
Taichu!

672
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:53,850
In here! In here!

673
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:56,410
Taichu! Taichu! Taichu!

674
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:57,530
Are you guys alright?

675
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:58,760
Yes, we’re fine.

676
00:42:58,780 --> 00:42:59,770
Hang in there.

677
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:00,840
I’ll pull you out.

678
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:06,400
Shengzhe!

679
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:08,930
Big sister!

680
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:11,170
We’re saved!

681
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:13,690
Shengzhe.

682
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:30,370
Here.

683
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:33,540
Cabriolet guy, have some more.

684
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:35,840
Thank you, Mama Jinzhi.

685
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:38,300
I may be not a good cook,

686
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,420
but my handmade noodles

687
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,940
are the best in Guanmei.

688
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:42,170
Then I have to have more.

689
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:43,160
Yes.

690
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,920
More meat for you!

691
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:45,740
Here.

692
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:47,630
Thank you.

693
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:50,410
Here!

694
00:43:58,630 --> 00:43:59,300
Eat your noodles!

695
00:43:59,320 --> 00:43:59,970
Mom!

696
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:05,180
Tonghao saved me.

697
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:09,320
Enjoy.

698
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:15,390
Taichu got you out.

699
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:16,990
You should be grateful to him!

700
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,790
Taichu, more for you.

701
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:20,290
Thank you, Taichu.

702
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:26,990
Hope you enjoy it.

703
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:37,040
Tonghao,

704
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,220
what did you do in the past?

705
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:40,490
Where are you from?

706
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:43,440
Tonghao!

707
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,300
He…

708
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:53,810
He’s the son of a distant relative.

709
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:55,630
He’s Qianyu’s…

710
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,740
Cousin, cousin.

711
00:44:58,840 --> 00:44:59,810
Qianyu’s cousin.

712
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:00,510
Right.

713
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:02,330
That’s it.

714
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,450
He’s in our debt. He works for us to pay the debt.

715
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:07,650
Right!

716
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:08,810
The two of them

717
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:10,380
have no intimate relations.

718
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:12,670
Oh, I see.

719
00:45:13,850 --> 00:45:14,740
Eat, eat!

720
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:15,830
