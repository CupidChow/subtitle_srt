11
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,310
When you called me for dinner,

12
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,000
I had an illusion.

13
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,230
It was like we were little again.

14
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,190
When Mom made the dinner,

15
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,080
she’d call the three of us to come downstairs.

16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,190
Is it the feeling of being at home?

17
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,670
It seems I should change the code.

18
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,600
Mr. Xu,

19
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,630
I heard you didn’t show up lately

20
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,630
due to the cooperation.

21
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,190
Is this the so-called cooperation?

22
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:41,030
I suppose you’re not invited for dinner.

23
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:43,960
I have no interest in your dinner.

24
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,110
I just want to know

25
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,600
what you want to do.

26
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,110
Zhang Minghan.

27
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,390
If you have questions,

28
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,630
I’ll answer you tomorrow in the company.

29
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,550
Xu Ziqian,

30
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,960
Shan Junhao has lost everything.

31
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,160
You should be satisfied with the result.

32
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,190
Shouldn't you put your attention

33
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,360
on Senwell?

34
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,910
You shut down so many projects by an order.

35
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,750
Before the board reaches a resolution,

36
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,630
you have no right to give such an order.

37
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,110
What’s happened in the company?

38
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,360
It seems you know nothing about it.

39
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,000
Let Mr. Xu explain to you.

40
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,630
Zhang Minghan,

41
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,160
I’m the dominant shareholder of Senwell.

42
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,470
My decision

43
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,550
is the board’s decision.

44
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,830
You call off so many projects

45
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,470
just for the chain supermarket project?

46
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,910
You gather all the scattered risks

47
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:04,960
in one.

48
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,160
What will you do if it goes wrong?

49
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,550
How many times have I told you?

50
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,470
I’ll usher Senwell

51
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,910
into a new era.

52
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,920
See things in a broader perspective, OK?

53
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,230
The returns of the chain supermarket project

54
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,760
is far beyond your imagination.

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,440
Yes, it is beyond imagination.

56
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,640
My steak is getting cold.

57
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,400
Good night.

58
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,390
Xu Ziqian,

59
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,130
I ask you…

60
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:43,870
Please go.

61
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,110
Ziqian,

62
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,390
while I was away,

63
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,920
what’s happened in the company?

64
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,070
Don’t worry, Yunyi.

65
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,720
They’re just not used to the new start.

66
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:26,600
Let’s get back to dinner.

67
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,160
What is the chain supermarket project?

68
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,640
Why haven’t I heard about it before?

69
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,440
It’s a project

70
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,320
that will set us completely free.

71
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,720
Completely free?

72
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,640
What does that mean?

73
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:53,920
In the last years,

74
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,230
I’ve regarded Junhao’s parents

75
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,200
as my own families

76
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,440
and taken care of them whole-heartedly

77
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,920
in appreciation of them raising me.

78
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,790
However,

79
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,440
they deceived me,

80
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,040
for so many years.

81
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,440
I finally get it

82
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,000
why Shan Yaolong said sorry to me

83
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,720
in his death bed.

84
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,760
As for Junhao,

85
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:35,880
I know

86
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,160
you’d say he has nothing to do with this.

87
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,670
But what he did wrong

88
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,390
is to break your heart.

89
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,550
From today on,

90
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,110
Shan Junhao is officially

91
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,950
a member of Guanmei Inn as the Director.

92
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,880
Let’s welcome him!

93
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,670
- Welcome! - Welcome!

94
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:04,830
Welcome! Welcome!

95
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:05,830
I believe

96
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:06,830
with Tonghao here,

97
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,160
our inn will get better and better.

98
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,070
It sure will.

99
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:12,040
And it cheers us up

100
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,350
to see a handsome man every day.

101
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,920
But, Tonghao, can you adapt to the work?

102
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:16,760
You used to be

103
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,880
Senwell’s General Manager

104
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,790
and Chairman.

105
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,950
Guanmei is a tiny inn.

106
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,350
Don’t you feel degraded?

107
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:23,950
Hush!

108
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,160
Why do you bring it up?

109
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,270
Tonghao is back to Guanmei Inn.

110
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,320
This is his home.

111
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,880
How could he not adapt to his home?

112
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,000
Right!

113
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,160
Master is right.

114
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:35,670
This is my home.

115
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,600
Let the new day begin.

116
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:40,550
Go for it!

117
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,070
Go for it! Go for it! Go for it!

118
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,070
Each hidden scar has a lead.

119
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,320
Today, let’s try

120
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,480
to find the lead.

121
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:57,230
OK?

123
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:06,600
Now,

124
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:10,760
lie slowly back in the chair.

125
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:17,320
Try to relax yourself.

126
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,640
Relax your forehead.

127
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,880
Relax your eyes.

128
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:30,230
Relax every piece of your hair.

129
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:36,910
Relax every part of your body.

130
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,590
Take a deep breath.

One,

135
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,030
two,

136

Mom…

139
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,400
Sweet girl?

140
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:35,910
Sweet girl?

141
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:38,320
Sweetie, wake up.

142
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:41,640
Sweet girl?

143
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,470
Wake up.

144
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,080
Uncle Shan,

145
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,110
she’s so poor.

146
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,550
Can I take her home?

148

00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,230
what did you see?

150
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,670
I realize

151
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,440
a silent love

152
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,230
can be touching, too.

153
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,280
So now,

154
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,350
what do you think

155
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,960
love is?

156
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,760
Love…

157
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,790
Love has many definitions.

158
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,470
Love acknowledged by everyone

159
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,960
isn’t always true love.

160
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,030
Yunyi.

161
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,550
Doctor, how is she?

162
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,840
No need to worry.

163
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,840
Give Yunyi some time to accept herself.

164
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:48,640
I believe she’ll get better soon.

165
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,840
Thank you, doctor.

166
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,230
What’s up?

167
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,640
Nothing. Let’s go home.

168
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,590
OK.

169
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,960
Come in.

170
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:21,910
It’s cold.

171
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,960
I’m afraid your quilt is too thin.

172
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,080
Thank you.

173
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,280
So you do know how to say thank you.

174
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,080
Kids are mom’s kids forever.

175
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,440
If you miss them,

176
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,590
go to see them.

177
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:09,840
Morning.

178
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,780
Morning.

179
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,760
Daisy.

180
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,320
Here is your breakfast. Good girl.

181
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,550
Sit down and have breakfast.

182
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,040
Daisy already gets started.

183
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:27,310
OK.

184
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,440
Did you make all these?

185
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:39,340
Yes.

186
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,760
Have a bite and see if it’s to your taste.

187
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:42,830
OK.

188
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,670
It’s delicious.

189
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:54,910
Ziqian,

190
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,400
thank you.

191
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:57,880
For what?

192
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,550
I didn’t make the breakfast.

193
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,550
Thank you for taking me to Shan Residence.

194
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,790
I thought it was Junhao.

195
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:08,840
Sometimes, memory deceives us.

196
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,350
You remember.

197
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,960
I was too stubborn

198
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,320
to have disoriented myself.

199
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,520
In fact, no one abandoned me.

200
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,640
And no one has to dominate another.

201
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:25,470
I’ve adjusted myself.

202
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,640
Don’t worry.

203
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,280
I’m so pleased

204
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,030
that you come through.

205
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,440
All right. Let’s have breakfast.

206
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:35,910
OK.

207
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:48,440
Hello, Gary.

208
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:49,440
Mr. Xu,

209
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,910
the directors of board want to see you.

210
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,510
Moreover, Mr. Wang from GQ,

211
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:53,400
Mr. Liu from Wenhua,

212
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,400
and Mr. Huang from Yingdu

213
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:56,080
all have urged for a few times.

214
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:58,440
OK, I hear you.

215
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,670
I’ll see to it later.

216
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,090
Is it work?

217
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:04,000
No.

218
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:07,150
You’ve been looking after me lately

219
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:08,910
and seldom go to the company.

220
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,960
Now I’m OK.

221
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,400
Let’s go back to work.

222
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,230
You want to go back

223
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,910
and work in Senwell?

224
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,280
I know you weigh a lot on the corporate issues.

225
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,470
After so many changes lately,

226
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,670
there must be lots of things to handle.

227
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,030
Yunyi, like I said before,

228
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,840
actually, we could leave everything behind

229
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:44,150
and start over in a new place.

230
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,440
What about the company?

231
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,280
I’ll take care of the company.

232
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,910
The point is

233
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,150
are you willing to spend

234
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,790
a free life as we look forward to?

235
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,910
Just you and me.

236
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,160
I’m glad

237
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,590
you find it was me in your memory at 6.

238
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:18,400
In fact,

239
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,350
at the first time I met you,

240
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:23,800
I fell for you.

241
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,590
Due to your relationship with Junhao,

242
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,070
I had to bury my feelings

243
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,800
deep in my heart.

244
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,880
But I realized

245
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,560
my letting go didn’t bring happiness to you.

246
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,160
On the contrary, it caused so much pain.

247
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:47,310
Therefore,

248
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,000
I don’t want to be the watchman any longer.

249
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,560
I want to stay by your side,

250
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,680
protect you,

251
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,800
give everything you want

252
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,000
and make you the happiest woman

253
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:20,880
in the world.

254
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:23,470
Yunyi,

255
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,590
I love you.

256
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,150
Ziqian,

257
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:33,870
I’m happy too,

258
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,590
that I find it was you in my memory.

259
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,360
Yunyi,

260
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:42,880
are you willing to be with me?

261
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:52,230
Ziqian,

262
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,190
please give me some time.

263
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,830
I’ll consider it.

264
00:18:59,160 --> 00:18:59,760
OK.

265
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,350
Due to your efforts in Guanmei Inn lately,

266
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,400
my duty is much lighter.

267
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,950
It feels so good to punch in and out

268
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:17,710
each day with you.

269
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:21,520
So this is how it feels to date a colleague.

270
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:23,710
I knew

271
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,710
you would like the life in Guanmei.

272
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,640
It’s ordinary,

273
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,950
but I feel peaceful inside.

274
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,950
Junhao.

275
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,830
Mom.

276
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,160
I want to check on Yunyi.

277
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:54,160
Don’t know how she’s doing in these days.

278
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:55,640
I’m a little bit worried.

279
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:58,560
OK.

280
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,280
Take the car.

281
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:10,230
Leave the work in the inn to me.

282
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,160
I should go back to work.

283
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:14,430
Bye, aunt.

284
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:18,350
Be careful.

285
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:19,520
OK.

286
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,800
Mom, let’s go.

287
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:53,230
Junhao, come with me.

288
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,590
I’d better not.

289
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,230
I guess

290
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,310
Yunyi doesn’t want to see me now.

291
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,590
I’ll wait for you in the car.

292
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:13,310
I’m sorry.

293
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,920
I failed to look after you.

294
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:20,920
Mom,

295
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,590
I’m fine, really.

296
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,160
Don’t worry about me.

297
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:30,430
I did hate Junhao before.

298
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:31,830
I hated him for leaving me.

299
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,920
But I realized later

300
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,280
that I couldn’t make a man love me.

301
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:38,310
By blessing another,

302
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,830
I bring bless to myself.

303
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,430
The reason why I couldn’t get over Junhao

304
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:47,830
is largely because

305
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,560
I put the hope of my life

306
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,520
on one person.

307
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,560
So Junhao didn’t do anything wrong.

308
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,400
It’s my fault.

309
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,520
No, it’s all my fault.

310
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,430
I made the choice

311
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,230
to regard you as Junhao’s wife

312
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,880
and my daughter-in-law.

313
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:09,350
I’m being selfish

314
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,880
that causes so much pain to you.

315
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,070
Mom, don’t say that.

316
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,830
You’re not wrong.

317
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,160
To be Junhao’s wife

318
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,920
used to be my own will,

319
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,040
not yours forced on me.

320
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:28,830
Besides,

321
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,830
you and Dad raised me.

322
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,920
You’re my families forever.

323
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,280
So,

324
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,520
can I continue to be your daughter?

325
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,560
Mom.

326
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:51,950
I’m so delighted

327
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,400
and joyful

328
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,000
that you said that.

329
00:22:58,830 --> 00:22:59,560
But,

330
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,280
I’m worried about Ziqian.

331
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,190
After what happened lately,

332
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:15,880
there’s no way
we could turn him back to who he was.

333
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,760
I understand.

334
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,760
The Shans wronged him.

335
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:28,040
Is he alright in these days?

336
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,560
He’s fine.

337
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,590
Though

338
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:34,400
he’s taken over Senwell Group,

339
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,400
he told me

340
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,680
this isn’t what he cares and wants.

341
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,160
He wants to leave.

342
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,110
And I

343
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,710
will leave with him.

344
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,640
Are you two together?

345
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,310
Not yet.

346
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,760
But, after what we’ve been through,

347
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,190
I realized

348
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,880
that Ziqian was the one

349
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,680
brought me home and stayed by my side.

350
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:12,590
Whatever becomes of us in the future,

351
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:16,950
as long as you live a happy life,

352
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,760
I’m relieved.

353
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,760
Thanks, Mom.

354
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,760
Where are you going?

355
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,190
It’s just an idea.

356
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,430
We don’t have a plan, yet.

357
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,110
Please take good care of him.

358
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,110
It’s too much to ask for his forgiveness.

359
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,110
As long as he’s happy,

360
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:44,920
I’m happy.

361
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:47,880
Trust me, Mom.

362
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:49,190
I will.

363
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:56,880
Mom,

364
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:02,350
perhaps time will change his mind.

365
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:15,830
Mom,

366
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,350
how is Yunyi?

367
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,040
She’s come through.

368
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,640
Her mental status is good.

369
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:32,760
Glad to hear.

370
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,230
Yunyi said

371
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:36,830
she and Ziqian are leaving.

372
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,590
Anyway,

373
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:40,520
if they can look after each other,

374
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:42,400
I’ll have no worries.

375
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,470
Cabriolet guy,

376
00:25:58,470 --> 00:25:59,470
= Money Bag Grocery =
isn’t this nice?

377
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:01,040
= Money Bag Grocery =
You should come to visit. Right?

378
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:03,830
What’s up?

379
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:05,310
You’re home.

380
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,560
Mrs. Shan.

381
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,830
Hello.

382
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,680
Shan Junhao,

383
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:15,710
I want to ask something

384
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:16,800
about Senwell.

385
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,040
You two catch up.

386
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,230
I’ll get in.

387
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,520
Give you some time.

388
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,950
Chen! Chen!

389
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:30,190
Right.

390
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,350
I’ll go make dinner.

391
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,680
I need to get prepared.

392
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,590
Come and help me in the kitchen.

393
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:46,830
What is it?

394
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:50,880
Xu Ziqian calls off projects in Guanmei,

395
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,400
St. Lucia,

396
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:53,310
Seychelles,

397
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,470
and Marrakech.

398
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:55,950
Do you know about it?

399
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,000
I have nothing to do

400
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,110
with Senwell now.

401
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,830
It’s said Xu Ziqian shuts down these projects

402
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,350
to give full support

403
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:09,000
to a chain supermarket project with Marv.

404
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,470
Marv?

405
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:11,500
Yes.

406
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,190
Marv has been a major competitor

407
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:14,520
to Senwell.

408
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:15,520
Moreover,

409
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,430
I heard Marv’s background is complicated.

410
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:20,920
These projects

411
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,800
are the major projects I led.

412
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,040
Maybe this is why Ziqian calls them off.

413
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,310
I’m quite familiar

414
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,470
with Marv’s vicious competition.

415
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,070
As to the others,

416
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:33,880
I heard something

417
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,710
but don’t know the whole picture.

418
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,800
Zhang Minghan and the others directors

419
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,000
don’t agree to do that.

420
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:39,880
Moreover,

421
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,110
Xu Ziqian can’t call off projects

422
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,160
for private reasons,

423
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,800
especially projects with foreseeable returns.

424
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:50,280
The shutdown of any of the projects

425
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,800
will lead to huge loss.

426
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,470
Put aside the expected returns.

427
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,070
The investment already made is huge.

428
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,920
Xu Ziqian must know it clearly.

429
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:01,640
So what’s the reason he insists
on shutting them down?

430
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,450
No idea.

431
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:06,830
And it’s no longer my concern.

432
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:10,350
Why do you care?

433
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,760
I just have a bad feeling.

434
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:20,230
Ziqian said

435
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,520
he wants to let go everything and leave.

436
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,350
I’m not sure what exactly he means.

437
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:29,040
Hopefully, it won’t end up ugly.

438
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,800
Come on, a toast.

439
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,000
A toast.

440
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:43,430
I like wise men like Mr. Xu,

441
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:45,760
who put interest before personal feelings.

442
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,470
We take what we need.

443
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,710
By the way, Mr. Qin, Mr. Xu,

444
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,560
what’s the progress of the project

445
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,520
we talked about last time?

446
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,760
OK, let’s get down to business.

447
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,520
How is it going

448
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:08,920
with the chain supermarket project?

449
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,560
Very well.

450
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:12,560
When can we sign the contract?

451
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,040
My boss is busting my hump.

452
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,470
I’ll let you know when it’s time.

453
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,400
You have to hurry.

454
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,070
After all, it’s a large sum of capital.

455
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:24,520
Lots of eyes on it.

456
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:27,070
Trust me.

457
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:28,880
I know what to do.

458
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,160
You’re more flexible than Shan Junhao.

459
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:35,190
My boss likes you.

460
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,400
I don’t care if they like me or not.

461
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,760
I’m doing this

462
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,350
for myself only.

463
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,230
Here come the dishes.

464
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,340
= Money Bag Grocery =

465
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,000
We’re all set.

466
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,640
Let’s have dinner.

467
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,310
Come on.

468
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,860
- Help yourself. - Don’t be shy.

469
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:05,710
Make yourself at home.

470
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:07,830
Cabriolet guy,

471
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:10,280
you haven’t come here to dine with us for long.

472
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:13,190
I made your favorite stir-fried crabs.

473
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,430
Thank you, Mama Jinzhi.

474
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,310
My cooking

475
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,430
is the top-notch in Guanmei.

476
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,110
Yes.

477
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,310
Even my mom likes

478
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,920
Mama Jinzhi’s soup and dishes.

479
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:28,800
Compared to Mrs. Lin’s cooking,

480
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,950
hers is a little bit poor.

481
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,040
No one forces you to eat it.

482
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:39,680
Come on.

483
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,590
Help yourself.

484
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,680
Guys,

485
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:51,800
if Xu Ziqian shuts down
Guanmei Fishing Village project,

486
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:53,160
what should we do?

487
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:56,950
Ziqian isn’t an impulsive man.

488
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,110
If we find out

489
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,350
the real reason he wants to call it off,

490
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,710
maybe we can make a change.

491
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,280
Why would he

492
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,350
partner with his competitor?

493
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:08,710
Senwell and Marv

494
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:09,920
are incompatible foes.

495
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,880
There’s no chance they could form a partnership.

496
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,310
Shan Junhao,

497
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:18,760
have you ever thought about
asking Xu Ziqian face to face?

498
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,680
Ziqian, you’re home.

499
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:43,430
Yunyi.

500
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,680
You drank.

501
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,330
Sit.

502
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:47,400
Easy.

503
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:54,950
Why do you drink so much?

504
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,280
Yunyi,

505
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:09,590
I miss you so much every minute and every second

506
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:12,350
I’m away from you.

507
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:19,760
I love you.

508
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,650
I love you.

509
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,040
I love you.

510
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,720
I love you.

511
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:33,920
I love you.

512
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:38,710
For so, so many years.

513
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,430
Be with me, please.

514
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:00,350
OK?

515
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,920
Are you willing to be with me?

516
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,710
Are you willing to let go of everything

517
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:36,880
and come with me

518
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,800
to a place that belongs to the two of us?

519
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,710
And Daisy.

520
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:46,680
Right, and Daisy.

521
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,950
- Isn’t that Mr. Shan? - Right.

522
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:46,060
- Why is he coming? - Don’t know.

523
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:46,920
- Let’s go. - Go.

524
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:47,600
Morning.

525
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:49,320
Morning, General Manager.

526
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,040
Morning, General Manager.

527
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,230
I’m not

528
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:55,430
Senwell’s General Manager anymore.

529
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,910
Mr. Shan.

530
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,190
- Look, isn’t that Mr. Shan? - Right.

531
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,440
Is Chairman Xu here?

532
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:03,230
He hasn’t come yet.

533
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,150
OK.

534
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:07,840
I’ll wait for him.

535
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:09,000
OK.

536
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:39,600
Morning, Chairman Xu.

537
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,470
Morning.

538
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,040
Ziqian,

539
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,840
can you give me a few minutes?

540
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:53,520
I want to talk.

541
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:54,800
I’m busy.

542
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:56,040
Ziqian.

543
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,080
I heard

544
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:03,670
you’re working with Marv

545
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:05,600
on a chain supermarket project,

546
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,470
that requires tens of billions.

547
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,470
Do I need

548
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,150
to report to you on what I’m doing?

549
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,150
I know

550
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:22,040
I have nothing to do with all these.

551
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:23,280
But,

552
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,560
we spent so much

553
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,080
on Guanmei Fishing Village project.

554
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:30,670
I hope earnestly

555
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:32,320
that the project can be completed.

556
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,190
I’m afraid I’m gonna let you down.

557
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:47,120
Ziqian,

558
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:49,600
the project Senwell

559
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,760
and Marv are working on is huge.

560
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,470
But Marv is notorious

561
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:53,840
in this industry.

562
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,320
I’m concerned that it’d go wrong.

563
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:01,800
Shan Junhao,

564
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:04,800
at present,

565
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,950
I’m the Chairman of Senwell.

566
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,190
Don’t point your fingers

567
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:11,910
to any of my decisions.

568
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:15,000
Senwell has nothing to do with you,

569
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,670
not now, not ever.

570
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:21,190
I know.

571
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:23,560
But Senwell

572
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,710
is the legacy of our fathers.

573
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:31,600
How dare you bring up our fathers?

574
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,910
Have you forgotten

575
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:36,520
what your father did to mine?

576
00:37:56,100 --> 00:38:01,460
= Qingcheng People’s Court =

577
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:18,670
Junhao.

578
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,280
Yunyi.

579
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,870
Thank you for coming.

580
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:33,230
In fact, I have something to say to you.

581
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,120
When Mom went to see you,

582
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,630
I was waiting outside.

583
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:43,710
Because I wasn’t sure if you wanted to see me.

584
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:52,150
We shouldn’t have been so alienated.

585
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,230
I was wrong for being stubborn.

586
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:58,150
Yunyi,

587
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:02,520
I’ve been hoping to make a proper apology.

588
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,280
I’m sorry.

589
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:07,560
We grew up together

590
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,470
and took too many things for granted.

591
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,670
In the past, I put all my attention on the career

592
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:20,230
and mistook family as lover.

593
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,280
Before Ye Qianyu came into my life,

594
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,190
I believed the two of us

595
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,000
would spend the whole life like that.

596
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:32,430
No more excuses for myself.

597
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:35,120
I betrayed you.

598
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:37,360
I apologize.

599
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:44,000
In Shan Residence,

600
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:47,080
I tried hard to please Dad and Mom,

601
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,560
and to please you.

602
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,360
Because I wanted you all to like me

603
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,800
and I was afraid to be deserted again.

604
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:57,150
So,

605
00:39:57,630 --> 00:40:00,390
when you left me for Ye Qianyu,

606
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:03,230
the feeling of being deserted

607
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:04,630
haunted me at night.

608
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,320
It drove me crazy

609
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:10,320
and led to so many wrongdoings.

610
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,710
So, Junhao,

611
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:21,630
I want to apologize to you and Ye Qianyu, too.

612
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,670
I’m sorry.

613
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,670
In fact, I discovered the love
between you long time ago,

614
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,560
but I wanted to pull you back to me

615
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,520
and caused you lots of troubles.

616
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,150
Yunyi,

617
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,710
don’t say that.

618
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,080
It’s not your fault.

619
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,840
It’s mine.

620
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:44,600
I didn’t realize until recently

621
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:48,800
that the person brought me to Shan Residence

622
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,950
is Ziqian.

623
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:54,470
But… I mistook it as you.

624
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,630
So our memories deceive, too.

625
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:14,600
Actually, Ziqian is a lonely man.

626
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:17,670
I wasn’t aware of his feelings all along.

627
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,630
With you keeping him company,

628
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:26,670
he won’t feel lonely anymore.

629
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,360
According to Ziqian,

630
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,800
he wants to leave.

631
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:37,040
Has he ever told you about

632
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,120
what he’s gonna do about Senwell?

633
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:45,320
He seldom talks to me
about the corporate affairs lately.

634
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,840
I just met Ziqian.

635
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,470
You…

636
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,150
I went to see him

637
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:12,950
for something about Senwell.

638
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:20,000
I heard Ziqian is working with Marv

639
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:23,520
on a national chain supermarket project

640
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:25,710
which requires tens of billions of investment.

641
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,560
For this project,

642
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,710
he halts other major ongoing projects,

643
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,520
including Guanmei Fishing Village project.

644
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,760
Either from the perspective of business interest

645
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,320
or corporate development,

646
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,670
I don’t understand

647
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:46,950
why Ziqian makes such a decision.

648
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,190
Are there any other reasons?

649
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:55,120
Marv has a poor standing in the industry.

650
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,150
I’m deeply concerned.

651
00:42:58,190 --> 00:43:00,430
But he refuses to tell me anything.

652
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,520
I’ll figure out what’s going on.

653
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:20,520
Mr. Wang,

654
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:22,910
I’ve been wishing to talk to Xu Ziqian.

655
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,760
But he refuses to meet me.

656
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:26,560
As the Vice President, Zhang Minghan

657
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,230
knows very little about it, too.

658
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,950
So far, everyone in Senwell is disoriented.

659
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:33,520
If Senwell breaks the deal

660
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,560
on Guanmei Fishing Village project,

661
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:38,630
it’s gonna be a large sum of default fine to pay.

662
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,560
What makes Senwell rather pay the default fine

663
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:44,000
than continue this project?

664
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:49,120
Xu Ziqian and Shan Junhao
walk in different styles.

665
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,080
Xu seems moderate.

666
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:51,910
In fact, he’s hardly predictable.

667
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:54,190
Recently I heard rumors

668
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:57,280
that Xu Ziqian is close with Mr. Qin from Marv.

669
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,710
It seems quite unusual.

670
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:01,910
I wonder if it’s related to Senwell’s upheaval.

671
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:04,000
Marv Group?

672
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:06,230
Marv Group is involved

673
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:08,600
in many illegal money-laundering projects.

674
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:09,630
It’s notorious.

675
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:13,230
Why is Xu Ziqian with Mr. Qin?

676
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:19,630
You’ve spent long enough with me.

677
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:21,870
Don’t delay your work for me.

678
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:25,230
You just take over Senwell.

679
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,120
There must be so many things to deal with.

680
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,360
Indeed, there are things to be processed

681
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:36,080
so that we can leave together.

682
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,150
What are they?

683
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,080
Is there anything I can do?

684
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,190
Don’t worry, Yunyi.

685
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:47,470
I can handle it.

686
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,520
Just make yourself feel better.

687
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:00,560
I heard

688
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:04,190
you’re going to cooperate with Marv.

689
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:06,150
Is it real?

690
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,080
Who… Who told you that?

691
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:18,150
Former colleagues.

692
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:20,910
I worked in Senwell, didn’t I?

693
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,080
Is it Shan Junhao?

694
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:38,630
What does he want?

695
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,630
Don’t you have enough harm from him?

696
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:44,760
I won’t get hurt by him anymore.

697
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:48,950
Ziqian,

698
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:50,950
don’t worry about me.

699
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,320
We feel hurt because we love each other.

700
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:57,230
My relationship with Junhao is over.

701
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:00,040
Now we’re just families.

702
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:09,560
Families?

703
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,230
What does he want?

704
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,870
He’s worried about you.

705
00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:27,800
I don’t need a hypocrite to worry about me.

706
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:31,950
And I don’t need such a hypocritical family.

707
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,040
Yunyi, have you forgotten

708
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:39,080
how he hurt you before?

709
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,870
It’s all gone.

710
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,360
We need to put it behind.

711
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,630
But those bygones

712
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:01,120
are nightmares to me.

713
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,390
I can never forget.

714
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:13,190
