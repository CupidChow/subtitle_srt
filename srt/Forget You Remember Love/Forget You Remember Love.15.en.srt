11
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,720
I don’t think Zhang Minghan will step down easily.

12
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,160
After all,

13
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,230
he was elected by the board.

14
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,720
While you were away,

15
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,440
he won most of the board members over.

16
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,080
So,

17
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,480
the odds are against us.

18
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,160
What’s our plan now?

19
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,630
We don’t need a plan

20
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:02,910
to bring him down.

21
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,910
Ability is the most powerful weapon.

22
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,310
And Junhao’s ability

23
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,600
is highly recognized by the board and investors.

24
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:10,800
Actually,

25
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,360
during Junhao’s absence,

26
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,830
Zhang Minghan

27
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,630
couldn’t handle most of the projects.

28
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,910
Ziqian has a point.

29
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,470
Those projects can be used against him.

30
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,160
Dawei,

31
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:27,270
I need a progress summary

32
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,080
of all the following projects.

33
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,600
Yes. I’m on it.

34
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:40,670
Ziqian.

35
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,110
Thanks for your help.

36
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,160
No big deal.

37
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:48,750
You can thank me

38
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,830
by playing snooker with me.

39
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,800
Without you,

40
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,830
I have no match.

41
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,000
Sure.

42
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,630
Deal.

43
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,550
Since Shan Junhao called for a board meeting,

44
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,440
he must’ve had something

45
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,960
to get back his position.

46
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,720
After he went missing,

47
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,550
we handled every project flawlessly

48
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,390
and won the board’s trust.

49
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,110
Don’t be afraid of him.

50
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:27,720
I’m not afraid.

51
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,190
Instead of being on the defensive.

52
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,600
our best choice is to attack.

53
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:34,800
How?

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,360
What did you find

55
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:39,550
about Shan Junhao’s missing?

56
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,030
Over the past few months,

57
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,030
he was close to a girl named Ye Qianyu.

58
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,190
Ye Qianyu?

59
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,440
The one who threatened us

60
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,960
with a photo of white dolphins?

61
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,030
Yes.

62
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,910
They aren’t just friends.

63
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,390
How did you know?

64
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,670
My men

65
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,800
saw Ye Qianyu

66
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,800
showing up near Shan Junhao’s house.

67
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,160
Near his house?

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,550
You had people monitoring him?

69
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,480
After Xu Ziqian said he’d be back,

70
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,110
I’d like to verify it,

71
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,880
so I placed men there.

72
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,760
They only monitored him

73
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:29,760
without doing anything else?

74
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,350
Nothing at all.

75
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,040
I heard Shan Junhao was hit by a car

76
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,160
before he came back.

77
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:41,550
Mr. Zhang,

78
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,760
we’re businessmen

79
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,920
and can only do business.

80
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,640
Perhaps we can use Ye Qianyu

81
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,200
to destroy Shan Junhao.

82
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:56,950
Dig up everything on her.

83
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:57,760
Be quick.

84
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:00,640
Yes.

85
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:13,670
Zhao Qun.

86
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,760
Go to Guanmei Fishing Village tomorrow.

87
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,070
I don’t trust their words.

88
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,040
Yes, boss.

89
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:29,950
Junhao.

90
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,440
This is your favorite.

91
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:33,830
Eat up. You need more nutrients.

92
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:38,200
You suffered a lot.

93
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,790
Look how skinny and tanned are you!

94
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,510
Aunt Jiang. You should eat more, too.

95
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:45,160
OK.

96
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,230
You, too.

97
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,110
Where was I

98
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,510
over the past few months?

99
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,110
I only remember

100
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,830
there was a sea.

101
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,230
You were in Guanmei Fishing...

102
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,350
You were there...

103
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:07,950
Yes.

104
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,160
You were resting there.

105
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,160
The air and water there are clean

106
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,440
but the UV light is strong,

107
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,720
so you’re tanned.

108
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,440
You still look handsome, though.

109
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,270
Celebrities love getting themselves tanned.

110
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,600
Yunyi is right.

111
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,670
You disappeared in the middle

112
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:34,510
of you and Yunyi’s engagement.

113
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,110
Now that you’re back,

114
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,000
you should finish it.

115
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:40,720
I can’t wait

116
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:44,000
to have Yunyi as my daughter-in-law.

117
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,390
The engagement

118
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,670
is simply a formality.

119
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,720
Since I put on this ring,

120
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,070
I’ve already regarded Junhao

121
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:00,950
as my husband.

122
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,200
This ring...

123
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,880
What’s wrong, Junhao?

124
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,640
Are you OK?

125
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,950
I’m fine.

126
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,440
Just a mild headache.

127
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:32,510
Junhao.

128
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,270
The doctor said you injured your head,

129
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,950
so you need to rest well for some time.

130
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,880
Don’t force yourself

131
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,200
to recall anything.

132
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,110
Try to relax yourself.

133
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:48,950
Look,

134
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:51,040
you two are practically engaged.

135
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,950
Why don’t you just get married?

136
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:58,880
Get married?

137
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,510
I have no objections.

138
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,040
What about you, Junhao?

139
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,400
Tonghao.

140
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:22,460
Liyin,

141
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,560
our honey water

142
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,020
is the healthiest and best detox drink.

143
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,220
Do you want some?

144
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,980
Thanks.

145
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,460
Tonghao?

146
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,500
Liyin,

147
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:39,980
it’s me, Sheng.

148
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,590
I gave you the honey water,

149
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,020
not Tonghao.

150
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,060
When was the last time we saw Tonghao here?

151
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,020
Qianyu also hasn’t come for days.

152
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,780
Don’t you find it strange?

153
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:54,700
Ouch!

154
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,400
How is it strange?

155
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,910
They’re in love.

156
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,400
Those lovebirds

157
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,940
have no time for us.

158
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,700
Tonghao is Qianyu’s first love.

159
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,540
I bet they can’t get their hands

160
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,640
off each other.

161
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,620
They have no time to work.

162
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:17,470
But Money Bag Grocery

163
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,220
is closed for days, too.

164
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,260
That is strange.

165
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,820
Jinzhi loves money.

166
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:28,470
She didn’t close the store on typhoon days,

167
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:32,140
but why now?

168
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,100
It does seem odd.

169
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,740
Read this news.

170
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,020
= Former GM of Senwell Shan Junhao Returned
The War is On =

171
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:42,110
What’s so special about it?

172
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,200
When Tonghao was absent,

173
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,550
Senwell announced

174
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,400
that Shan Junhao had come back from abroad.

175
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,140
It can’t be a coincidence.

176
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:01,550
Are we right that he really is Shan Junhao?

177
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,140
You are.

178
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:09,500
Tonghao is Shan Junhao.

179
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,080
You’re back.

180
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,760
- Welcome back. - Welcome.

181
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,020
Qianyu.

182
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,000
Tang said you’d be back today,

183
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,020
so I baked a big cake especially for you.

184
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,840
May you recover soon.

185
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,760
I wrote the words on it.

186
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,780
Their handwriting is terrible.

187
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,020
Qianyu,

188
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:45,220
isn’t Tonghao back with you?

189
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,880
Thank you.

190
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,020
Thanks. Thanks.

191
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,640
Jinzhi,

192
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,150
don’t you always

193
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,670
want to marry Qianyu to a rich man?

194
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,880
It will soon come true.

195
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,060
I heard

196
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,860
Shan Junhao is a billionaire.

197
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,580
Jinzhi,

198
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,710
when you become his mother-in-law,

199
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,280
don’t forget about us.

200
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:08,640
Hey, Qianyu,

201
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,470
now that you’re

202
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,910
Shan Junhao’s girlfriend,

203
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,580
the debt

204
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,980
we owe Senwell

205
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,110
can be written off, right?

206
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,150
Of course.

207
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,280
That’s only a drop in the bucket

208
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,320
to them.

209
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:23,710
Consider it a betrothal present.

210
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:24,670
Yeah.

211
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:25,230
Right. Right.

212
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:26,710
Hey, guys,

213
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,710
that’s enough.

214
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,280
Money and love

215
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,590
can’t be mixed together.

216
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:31,960
They’re irrelevant.

217
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,710
Fine. Alright.

218
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:37,110
Let’s eat the cake.

219
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,180
Yes.

220
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,820
- Yes. Let’s eat. - Yes. Let’s eat.

221
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:42,910
Qianyu.

222
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,000
What happened?

223
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,790
What’s wrong?

224
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:48,470
What’s up?

225
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,080
Tonghao or Shan Junhao

226
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:52,080
is a stranger to us.

227
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,710
Go back to work.

228
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,020
This…

229
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:02,110
What’s going on?

230
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:02,910
Yeah.

231
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,030
There, there.

232
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,640
Don’t cry.

233
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,960
Or you’ll look like a mess.

234
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:29,910
Mom,

235
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,400
I’m heartbroken.

236
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,440
I know.

237
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,660
I understand.

238
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,220
But that’s what love is.

239
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,060
It can bring you joys

240
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,980
as well as sorrows.

241
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,790
What should I do?

242
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,520
What about my life?

243
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,740
Failed relationships can help you grow.

244
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,820
You should learn to accept it

245
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,880
and let it go.

246
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,620
In the end,

247
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,350
we can only rely on ourselves.

248
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:18,140
Even if everyone abandons you,

249
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,860
you should live well on your own.

250
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,340
You have to be responsible for your own life.

251
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,620
When exactly

252
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,460
will the pain stop?

253
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,980
Time isn’t a cure.

254
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:39,900
It can’t heal you

255
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:44,300
but can numb your heart.

256
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,380
You’ll be fine

257
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,700
in a while.

258
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:18,520
It’s a new day to make money.

259
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:22,150
Go, go, go!

260
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,670
Welcome.

261
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,420
What are you doing here?

262
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,420
I’d like to talk to Ye Qianyu.

263
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:48,820
She has nothing to say to you.

264
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:09,500
= One Million RMB =

265
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,980
What do you mean?

266
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,780
I know you need money,

267
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:17,260
so I’m here to make you an offer.

268
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,300
What is it?

269
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:20,820
First,

270
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,900
don’t tell others

271
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,780
about the past between you and Junhao.

272
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:26,700
Second,

273
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:29,820
don’t ever show up in front of him again.

274
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,860
Tonghao is worth this much, huh?

275
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:41,910
Will you take it or not?

276
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,060
Did Tonghao ask you to come here?

277
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,340
You made up

278
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,660
that name.

279
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:55,670
You used his amnesia

280
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,200
to manipulate him.

281
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,670
That’s not love

282
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,520
but pure deception.

283
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,100
Luckily,

284
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,230
he’s got his memory back

285
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,350
and won’t fall for your lie again.

286
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,040
I never deceived him.

287
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:10,280
What he experienced in Guanmei

288
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,380
is real.

289
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,110
Junhao is the GM of Senwell,

290
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,880
yet you hid him on purpose

291
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,400
and kept his whereabouts secret.

292
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,230
Because of you, his father passed away

293
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,640
and Senwell is in turmoil.

294
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,100
He lost everything

295
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:26,400
due to your selfishness.

296
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:27,880
Shouldn’t you

297
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,470
take responsibility for it?

298
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,620
I have no idea.

299
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,180
I didn’t know Tonghao is Shan Junhao.

300
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,110
He was happy here.

301
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,590
Although he lost his memory,

302
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,350
he saw different things

303
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,880
and experienced a new life.

304
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,110
Why are you trying

305
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,800
to erase them all?

306
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,500
You stole his love

307
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,940
and you should give it back.

308
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,180
But how?

309
00:17:58,780 --> 00:17:59,700
Forget it.

310
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,220
He already did.

311
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,920
And so should you.

312
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,940
He did?

313
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,620
Yes.

314
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,060
He doesn’t remember anything

315
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,940
about Guanmei.

316
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,400
Take your check and get out.

317
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,020
Don’t bother us.

318
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:24,830
Leave!

319
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,710
Qianyu doesn’t know a Shan Junhao.

320
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,000
Don’t bring up that name again

321
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,160
in front of me.

322
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,710
Get out of here!

323
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:31,920
Get out. Out!

324
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,560
Ye Qianyu.

325
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:38,800
Don’t forget my two conditions.

326
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,060
OK. This is your key.

327
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:01,660
- OK. - OK.

328
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:03,140
- Thanks. - This way, please.

329
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,300
Welcome, sir.

330
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,500
Do you have a reservation?

331
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,420
No.

332
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,740
I don’t need a room.

333
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,900
= Zhao Qun General Manager’s Assistant =
This is my card.

334
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,470
General manager’s assistant.

335
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,920
Did we meet somewhere?

336
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,760
Last time, when they tried to tear down our inn,

337
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,230
you were there, too, right?

338
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,520
I was only following orders.

339
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:37,040
So, are you Tonghao’s assistant?

340
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,070
Tong... Tonghao?

341
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,710
Tonghao is Shan Junhao.

342
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:43,070
Isn’t he your boss?

343
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:45,780
Yes.

344
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:46,500
He is.

345
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:47,710
I’m his assistant.

346
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,460
Where’s Tonghao?

347
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,900
Did he come with you?

348
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:53,900
Tonghao?

349
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,700
Is Tonghao back?

350
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,580
Is Tonghao back?

351
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:57,940
Is Tonghao back?

352
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:58,940
Is Tonghao back?

353
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,160
Who are you?

354
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,280
- I… - He’s Tonghao’s assistant.

355
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:06,620
I knew

356
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,220
he’d come back to visit us.

357
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,540
Where is he?

358
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,300
He didn’t come

359
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,340
but he sent me instead.

360
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,140
Is he super busy?

361
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,140
Yes.

362
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,620
He just came back

363
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,300
and he’s occupied with work.

364
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,380
He’s busy.

365
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,060
Why did you call him Tonghao?

366
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,180
Qianyu gave him that game.

367
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,900
Are they close?

368
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,220
Of course.

369
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,620
They’re a couple.

370
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:32,860
Really?

371
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,340
Yeah.

372
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,340
You don’t know?

373
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,620
He’s Tonghao’s assistant.

374
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,340
It’s rude to have him stand here.

375
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,100
Let’s sit down and talk.

376
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,070
Have a seat.

377
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,160
- Please. - Here.

378
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:45,740
Here. Sit.

379
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:46,900
Sheng. Bring him some water.

380
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,620
OK.

381
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,540
No need, thanks.

382
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,540
Thank you for taking care of Mr. Shan.

383
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:53,620
Don’t mention it.

384
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,500
Actually, he did a lot for us.

385
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,100
Yes. Thanks to him,

386
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,260
our inn

387
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,540
has become so popular, right?

388
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,020
What did he do?

389
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,640
That’s a long list.

390
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:06,000
Let me tell you one by one.

391
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,560
Hotel management,

392
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,140
arrangement of items,

393
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,980
he upgraded this place

394
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:12,780
from inside out.

395
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:13,340
That’s right.

396
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:15,620
He taught us how to put a perfect sheet,

397
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,920
how to choose the best pillow

398
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,590
and a whole lot more.

399
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,230
He also helped me

400
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:22,350
cook various meals

401
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,760
catering to customers’ tastes.

402
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,460
He coached me to be the prettiest receptionist

403
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,820
and serve all customers

404
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:29,880
with my sweetest smile.

405
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,590
You’re pretty enough.

406
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,800
Most importantly,

407
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,950
he helped save our village.

408
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:37,110
He’s our hero!

409
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,380
- Hero! - Hero!

410
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:39,640
That’s right.

411
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:40,800
A while ago, the white dolphin,

412
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:41,680
white dolphin incident,

413
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,540
it was also Tonghao’s doing.

414
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,260
- He helped us with it. - Yes!

415
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,300
Indeed.

416
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,400
Are you sure?

417
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,950
I think they told the truth.

418
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:59,180
I browsed all Ye Qianyu’s posts on social media

419
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:01,540
and found this.

420
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,590
Who knows the one who will bury Shan Junhao

421
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,230
is himself.

422
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,340
Mama Jinzhi.

423
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,740
Long time no see.

424
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,460
Hey, cabriolet guy.

425
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,540
I thought you went abroad.

426
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:54,580
I did.

427
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,400
But now, I’m back.

428
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,040
Welcome back.

429
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,470
Qianyu.

430
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,470
Qianyu!

431
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,560
What?

432
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,400
Taichu!

433
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,400
Didn’t you go to South America?

434
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,190
I did.

435
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,190
But I missed Mama Jinzhi’s cooking so much,

436
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:19,070
so I came back.

437
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:27,800
Taichu.

438
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:30,590
I’m so glad you’re back.

439
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,400
It’s a nice day today.

440
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:35,180
Taichu.

441
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:37,260
Why don’t you and Qianyu go out for a walk?

442
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,700
She’s

443
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,760
locked herself in the room all day lately.

444
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:43,230
She’s almost molding.

445
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,190
Sure.

446
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:46,400
Qianyu.

447
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:48,920
Here’s a gift for you.

448
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,000
Let me see.

449
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,640
That’s too kind of you.

450
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,280
The color is amazing!

451
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,160
Go put it on.

452
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,300
Go.

453
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,380
Put it on now.

454
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,380
Thank you, Taichu.

455
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,100
Be quick.

456
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,780
Go, go, go.

457
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,070
Come down once you finish.

458
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,590
What would you like to drink?

459
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,680
I’m not picky.

460
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,230
I envy you

461
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,830
that you can travel a lot.

462
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,000
Bring me some photos next time.

463
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:39,400
My daughter looks stunning

464
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,420
once dressed up.

465
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,470
The moment I laid eyes on this dress,

466
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,830
I knew it’d fit you perfectly.

467
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,100
You have a good taste.

468
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,350
Hey,

469
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,420
you’re already dressed up.

470
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,700
Why don’t you and Taichu go on a date...

471
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,680
Take a stroll?

472
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,820
Let’s go.

473
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:05,860
Go ahead.

474
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,680
What a perfect match!

475
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:11,070
See you.

476
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:12,830
Bye-bye.

477
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:25,900
While I was away,

478
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,060
more and more people came to Guanmei to travel.

479
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,300
Yes.

480
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,430
Our village has changed a lot.

481
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,400
Social media

482
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,190
have been promoting Guanmei online.

483
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:36,640
It all thanks to Tonghao.

484
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:47,230
Shan Junhao is a genius in business.

485
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,400
This is a piece of cake.

486
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:53,310
You knew already?

487
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,280
Everyone knows

488
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,800
Shan Junhao is back to Senwell.

489
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,470
How I wish Tonghao weren’t him!

490
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:11,710
If there were such a wish,

491
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,760
why didn’t you wish

492
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,430
you hadn’t met him at all?

493
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:21,230
Qianyu.

494
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:23,190
You love Tonghao,

495
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,590
not Shan Junhao.

496
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,000
They’re different.

497
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,880
Tonghao is gone.

498
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,190
But Tonghao is part of him.

499
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,820
If it were true,

500
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:44,020
why didn’t he come back even once?

501
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,460
When he became Shan Junhao again,

502
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,860
why didn’t he come here to see you?

503
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,020
So,

504
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,470
what we had

505
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,470
was just a fling, right?

506
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:17,680
The first time

507
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:19,430
I put on this ring,

508
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,880
I couldn’t take it off however hard I tried.

509
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,830
Then it fell off itself

510
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:26,230
when I lost Tonghao.

511
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:29,880
This ring has magic.

512
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,160
Don’t you think?

513
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,880
It’s not the ring that has magic

514
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:37,070
but love.

515
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:44,800
Since it doesn’t belong to me,

516
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,070
I should let it go.

517
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:06,230
Let me help you.

518
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,060
You…

519
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:15,070
You threw it away?

520
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,160
Yeah.

521
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:18,680
You said to let it go.

522
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:22,230
I… I haven’t made up my mind.

523
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:23,800
It’s Tonghao’s ring.

524
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,560
I planned to return it to him.

525
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,640
I have to get it back.

526
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,710
Here it is.

527
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,740
I…

528
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,560
I saw it falling into the water.

529
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,880
That was something I bought in South Africa.

530
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:43,540
You still paid for it.

531
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:44,700
Go ahead then.

532
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,430
I was joking.

533
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,920
The past, however beautiful, is still the past.

534
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,920
True love may come

535
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,920
before you notice it.

536
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,680
After my alteration,

537
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,760
this ring has become a necklace.

538
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:13,470
It’s brand new

539
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,400
and no longer carry Tonghao’s mark.

540
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,190
This is my gift for you.

541
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,040
Thanks.

542
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,640
This is the Sri Lanka Beach Park Project.

543
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:48,420
= 2019 Sri Lanka Beach Park Project =

544
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:52,460
Junhao.

545
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,300
What’s wrong?

546
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:03,430
I don’t know

547
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:09,040
but my heart aches frequently

548
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:12,520
as if it were torn apart.

549
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,000
Let’s go to see the doctor.

550
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:16,640
No need.

551
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,430
I don’t think it’s a physical problem

552
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,000
but more like a mental one.

553
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,230
Qianyu.

554
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:13,280
Let me teach you to play the piano.

555
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:15,070
Maybe some other day.

556
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:25,040
It’s late. Aren’t you going back?

557
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,180
Oh, silly.

558
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,580
How could you kick him out?

559
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,400
Let me tell you a bedtime story before I leave.

560
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,420
I’m not a kid.

561
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:37,950
Adults can listen to stories, too.

562
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,140
Let me tell you

563
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,740
my experience in Venezuela this time.

564
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:44,620
One day,

565
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:47,230
I met an elder from Germany on the bus.

566
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,350
He carried his backpack with him all the time

567
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,830
and he loved chatting with others.

568
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:55,680
He said when he was young

569
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,400
he was too busy

570
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,110
to travel with his wife.

571
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,230
After she passed away,

572
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:03,710
it was too late to regret.

573
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:05,580
In his backpack...

574
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,160
Chen. What are you doing?

575
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,640
You’re too young to know.

576
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,070
At each stop,

577
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,280
he shared everything he saw

578
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,920
with his wife.

579
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:16,590
You know...

580
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,180
Chen,

581
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:21,520
are you hooking them up?

582
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:24,590
Go to bed.

583
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,230
A trip for two is different from traveling alone.

584
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,310
Go away.

585
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:29,880
I’ve been alone on the way for too long.

586
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:32,350
What will it be like

587
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:36,040
if I have company?

588
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:04,000
I love you, Qianyu.

589
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:27,870
Mama Jinzhi.

590
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,390
Shengzhe.

591
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:31,320
Where are you?

592
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,630
Open the door for me.

593
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:38,910
Good morning.

594
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:41,520
Why are you here?

595
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:44,800
You forgot

596
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,190
I told you story last night?

597
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,710
You dozed off before I finished.

598
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,800
When I meant to go back,

599
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,840
I found Mama Jinzhi had locked the door.

600
00:35:57,910 --> 00:35:59,950
Did you sleep well?

601
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,910
Did I disturb you?

602
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:04,080
What do you think?

603
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,000
It’s Chen’s fault.

604
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,950
How dare she lock the door!

605
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,710
Mama Jinzhi is adorable.

606
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,000
Adorable?

607
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:16,080
You can have her then.

608
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,760
After years of her torture,

609
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,870
it’s a miracle

610
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,430
that I grow up alive.

611
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:22,460
Qianyu,

612
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,470
I do envy you sometimes.

613
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,430
For what?

614
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,760
Your mom is fun,

615
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,760
and your younger brother is cute.

616
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,420
Growing up in this kind of family

617
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,380
is a delight.

618
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,220
Fun?

619
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,320
Cute?

620
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:41,800
I’m delighted

621
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:43,870
but we’re still poor.

622
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,150
I envy you, too.

623
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,910
You can tour around the world

624
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,150
and live a carefree life.

625
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,190
Unlike me,

626
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:52,600
if I want to head to downtown,

627
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:55,040
I’ll have to check if I have enough gas money.

628
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:57,760
What’s there to envy?

629
00:36:58,390 --> 00:36:59,870
It’s true that I’ve been to a lot of places,

630
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:02,320
but I do also feel tired and lonely sometimes

631
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:04,800
and want to settle down

632
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:07,430
to live a peaceful life.

633
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,120
Guanmei is a perfect choice.

634
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,470
You want to stay here?

635
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,560
You don’t welcome me?

636
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:14,670
No, no.

637
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,430
I didn’t mean that.

638
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:18,230
Then what’s your concern?

639
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,470
Nothing.

640
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:24,320
But...

641
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:26,190
Why Guanmei?

642
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,520
Because of you.

643
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,470
I was joking.

644
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,430
Don’t take it seriously.

645
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,840
You aren’t my type,

646
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:46,040
lion.

647
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,360
What are you doing here? Go away!

648
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,320
Qianyu. Taichu.

649
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,230
Are you up?

650
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,800
Breakfast is ready.

651
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,190
I’m so embarrassed because of you.

652
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:20,910
Morning, Mama Jinzhi.

653
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,520
Morning, Taichu.

654
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,320
Did you sleep well?

655
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:26,670
Not too bad.

656
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,670
Good. Great.

657
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:31,390
Come down for breakfast.

658
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,870
I’m not hungry.

659
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:33,710
I’m needed elsewhere.

660
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,520
Gotta go.

661
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:36,560
OK.

662
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,520
What are you looking at?

663
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,390
Forget about it.

664
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,190
You should get rid of

665
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:09,150
that guy’s stuff.

666
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,360
Will that help her forget about him?

667
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:15,120
What Qianyu needs is time.

668
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:19,390
But keeping it is of no help at all.

669
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:25,670
I wish you could lose your memory.

670
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,190
Qianyu.

671
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,080
Believe me.

672
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:40,230
Everything will be fine.

673
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,800
You should distract yourself.

674
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:50,470
Taichu is nice to you.

675
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:53,390
Chen Jinzhi.

676
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:55,600
Qianyu’s mind is already a mess.

677
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:57,600
Don’t make it bigger.

678
00:39:57,950 --> 00:39:59,190
What did I do wrong?

679
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:05,020
Mom,

680
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:06,670
I can’t use Taichu.

681
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,470
Don’t push him to me.

682
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:13,430
Yes.

683
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,320
Hey,

684
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:16,800
you should leave her alone.

685
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:21,670
When I see that Shan Junhao again,

686
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,630
I’ll chop him into pieces.

687
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:33,940
Junhao.

688
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:36,220
I made you coffee.

689
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:38,950
Thank you.

690
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:48,220
Junhao.

691
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,000
The doctor said you haven’t fully recovered.

692
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,120
Don’t exhaust yourself.

693
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:53,040
I’m fine.

694
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:56,040
The board meeting is tomorrow.

695
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:58,430
I need to familiarize myself

696
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,120
with the progress of all projects

697
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:02,710
launched during my absence,

698
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:05,320
to regain control

699
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,600
of the company.

700
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,430
What’s wrong?

701
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,430
Nothing.

702
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:18,600
I’m content seeing you like this.

703
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:31,000
Thanks for coming.

704
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:31,840
Please.

705
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,430
- Let’s go. - Thanks.

706
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,320
Qianyu.

707
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,390
Su Liyin.

708
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,230
What do you have for me?

709
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,870
Ye Qianyu.

710
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,430
Why was your letter delivered to our inn?

711
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,120
My letter?

712
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:56,040
Qianyu.

713
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,150
I hope you can come to Senwell tomorrow.

714
00:41:58,230 --> 00:41:59,320
I need you.

715
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,080
Shan Junhao.

716
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:04,120
Why did Tonghao ask you to go to Senwell?

717
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:05,080
Qianyu.

718
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,670
Tonghao wrote you a letter?

719
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:08,430
He sent his assistant

720
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:09,520
to come and see us yesterday.

721
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:12,840
Ye Qianyu. You’re such a lucky gal!

722
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:15,120
The guy you found turned out to be a billionaire.

723
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:18,600
It seems your dream will soon come true.

724
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:30,100
What’s wrong with Qianyu?

725
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,840
Qianyu. Let’s go out to have fun.

726
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:36,470
Do you want me to teach that jerk a lesson?

727
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:39,000
Let’s go see dolphins.

728
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:46,120
Taichu.

729
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:48,000
Thank you for trying to comfort me,

730
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:49,940
but...

731
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:51,560
I’m not in the mood.

732
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:53,470
I’m going back.

733
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:07,150
Shan Junhao wrote a letter to Qianyu?

734
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:07,950
Sheng,

735
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:09,390
you just said

736
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:11,360
his assistant was here.

737
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,390
Yes.

738
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:13,910
What did he say?

739
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:17,080
He asked about

740
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,430
what Tonghao did here.

741
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:19,950
Nothing special.

742
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:23,430
His assistant didn’t know anything.

743
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:25,390
He didn’t know the name Tonghao,

744
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:26,360
or why he ended up here.

745
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:27,910
He knew nothing.

746
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:30,040
I see. Thank you.

747
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,040
