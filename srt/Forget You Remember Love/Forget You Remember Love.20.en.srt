Those are the homestays

of today’s recommendation.

15
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:56,590
Go for a visit and you’ll like them.

See you next time.

17
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,000
This way, please.

18
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,800
It’s a beautiful place!

19
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,000
It’s beautiful!

20
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,520
It’s so beautiful!

21
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:42,240
So they are the friends?

22
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:44,600
Yeah.

23
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,750
Princess Snow,

24
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,880
you’re so beautiful!

25
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,190
Could you tell me

26
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,630
how can I be as pretty as you?

27
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,960
Save the compliments.

28
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,750
You have 3 minutes only.

= Soul of Guanmei Fishing Village =
= Guanmei Inn =

30
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:58,520
Princess Snow,

31
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,470
this is about Guanmei Fishing Village

32
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,360
and Guanmei Inn.

33
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:05,000
We’re new in homestay

34
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,750
but Guanmei Inn

35
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,030
is culturally and geographically blessed.

36
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,830
We boast 100 years’ history

37
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,160
and the village

38
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,800
is absolutely free of

39
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,750
commercial development.

40
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,110
The ecology in Guanmei sea

41
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,160
is getting better and better.

42
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,750
Even the legendary

43
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,550
Chinese white dolphins have returned.

44
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,800
An inn’s core values are its personality,

45
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,190
feelings and stories.

46
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,440
Unfortunately it seems

47
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,320
you enjoy your own stories very much,

48
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,960
but the visitors don’t.

49
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,520
You’re not giving high-quality

50
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,360
experiences and possibilities.

51
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,520
I made the coconut cake for you,

52
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,600
one of the inn’s brand products.

53
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,470
Take a bite,

54
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,520
you’ll like it.

55
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,190
I appreciate your efforts

56
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,600
to please me.

57
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,240
But,

58
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,350
the cake is dull.

59
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:17,950
It does not tell

60
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,790
anything about how special your inn is.

61
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,920
By the way, please do not try to please me.

62
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,920
That’s counterproductive.

63
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,160
Hey, you girl.

64
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,160
If you decline,

65
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,640
go straight and say no.

66
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,920
Why are you making it so hard?

67
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,390
Fengqiao!

68
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,160
Fengqiao!

69
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:37,950
Sorry for this.

70
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,790
I hate your attitude

71
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,270
more than you

72
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,640
fawning on me.

73
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,670
You…

74
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:44,600
She drives me mad!

75
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,920
Shut up, please.

76
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,830
Princess Snow,

77
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,200
we come here with

78
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,760
sincere good faith.

79
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,000
We don’t expect you to recommend

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,270
Guanmei Inn in your show,

81
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,880
but we do expect you to visit Guanmei Inn

82
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,440
to see the meteor shower.

83
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,790
If it is you who invites me,

84
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,160
I will say no.

85
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:06,790
Why?

86
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:07,480
Why?

87
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:09,230
Why?

88
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:09,790
What do you mean?

89
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,040
OK.

90
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,760
Time’s up,

91
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,440
and you didn’t persuade me.

92
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,640
Goodbye.

93
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,480
Princess Snow,

94
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,270
the cultural festival is

95
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,390
very important to us,

96
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,720
because we have to make something special

97
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,510
within a month,

98
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,670
or

99
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,160
Senwell will demolish Guanmei Inn.

100
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:31,440
The inn

101
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,600
is not only a homestay for visitors,

102
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,070
but also our home.

103
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:35,950
Yes,

104
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:38,320
I’ve been cooking for the inn for 20 years.

105
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,440
If Guanmei Inn is gone,

106
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,160
I…

107
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:44,000
I don’t know where I can go!

108
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,350
I would do anything for Guanmei Inn.

109
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,600
Princess Snow,

110
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,000
I’m sorry.

111
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,230
I apologize for my attitude.

112
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,670
I shouldn’t have done that.

113
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,350
Please give us a chance.

114
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,070
Actually I’m a nice girl.

115
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:03,480
I am. Ask them, please.

116
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,760
Yeah, Princess Snow,

117
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:09,230
many men wanted to marry Fengqiao,

118
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,920
but she rejected because

119
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,270
she doesn’t want to leave the inn.

120
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:14,920
I haven’t served the inn

121
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,390
for as long as they have.

122
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,790
But I swear

123
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,200
I will guard it.

124
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,670
Guanmei Inn has gone through a lot.

125
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,160
I am aware of the loss of money every day,

126
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:30,000
but I insist, never give up.

127
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,720
That’s why

128
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,920
I pledged all my equity

129
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,950
and it is in such situation.

130
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,000
But no matter

131
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,640
what happens,

132
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,350
I will not give up Guanmei Inn.

133
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,640
Princess Snow,

134
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,720
I admire you, I really do.

135
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,760
Please give us a chance.

136
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,480
We will not let you down.

137
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:52,390
I know

138
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,880
you must have been to many places

139
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,640
and you think

140
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,920
Guanmei Inn is nothing,

141
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,790
nothing special.

142
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,950
But it is special,

143
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,670
because it has us.

144
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,720
Guanmei Inn has us

145
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,720
who would do anything for it.

146
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,320
Taichu,

147
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:31,600
is this why you care about Guanmei Inn

148
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,070
and Guanmei Fishing Village so much?

149
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:34,790
Yes.

150
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,390
I care because of them.

151
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:41,830
They’re nice

152
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:42,720
and earnest.

153
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,200
OK.

154
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,920
Anyway, I’ll go to see the meteor shower,

155
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:52,480
maybe have a look at Guanmei Inn.

156
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,760
- Really? - Really?

157
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,040
That butterball

158
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,760
has some decency.

159
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,200
Why does he have Shengzhe’s photo?

160
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,510
Black-and-white?

161
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:34,670
Done!

162
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,280
Then begin to write.

163
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:38,030
What?

164
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,470
By hand?

165
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,110
Certainly by hand.

166
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,710
Hand writing delivers sincerity.

167
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,840
And,

168
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,910
email is of course easier,

169
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,280
but lacks affection.

170
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,880
Do it.

171
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,550
Fine.

172
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,110
Where’s that butterball?

173
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,790
Butterball, come over!

174
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:12,880
Chen Jinzhi,

175
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:15,000
what are you yelling at?

176
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,080
It’s early morning!

177
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,080
No wonder you’re so nice to Shengzhe,

178
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,760
because of the photo?

179
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,400
Give it to me!

180
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:29,400
What are you doing?

181
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:32,000
Everyone is working hard.

182
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,230
Could you get some work

183
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,710
rather than fighting?

184
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,280
He…

185
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,580
She…

186
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:38,590
You…

187
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:39,760
You…

188
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,760
She yells around like a gamecock!

189
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,150
Could you stop for a second?

190
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:46,590
Who is a gamecock?

191
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:48,520
Tell me, who is a gamecock?

192
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,440
Alright! Please!

193
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:49,880
Come on.

194
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,110
Who is?

195
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:50,760
Please!

196
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,150
I am.

197
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,200
You have to explain!

198
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:53,590
Please!

199
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:54,230
I am. I am.

200
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,110
I…

201
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,590
You butterball!

202
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,440
Why is Shengzhe in this suit?

203
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,230
And on a black-and-white photo?

204
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,230
Who is that woman?

205
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,280
Isn’t she Tang’s great-grandmother?

206
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,000
- I’ve seen her in an old photo. - Yes, she is.

207
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,840
Yes, yes.

208
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,030
The boy must be Tang’s grandfather.

209
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,400
Shengzhe resembles him.

210
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,300
Yes, yes.

211
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:21,000
So you admit Shengzhe is your son?

212
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,910
Who is the man that hated to

213
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:24,550
take a look at him?

214
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,230
Who is the man

215
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,590
that claimed he’s the son of me and another man?

216
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,670
He’s not your son.

217
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,550
It’s none of your business.

218
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,910
Go away, go away!

219
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,080
Go away, all of you.

220
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:42,520
Explain!

221
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,000
I didn’t blame you.

222
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:49,760
You just… You didn’t explain.

223
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,880
I didn’t explain?

224
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,280
I explained many times.

225
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,000
Did you believe me, you wood head?

226
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:58,150
Enough.

227
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,840
Chen. Tang.

228
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,320
Stop your fight.

229
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,790
You’ve been fighting for this

230
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,550
for half of your lives.

231
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,110
Now the truth is clear

232
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,280
and are you still fighting for it?

233
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,200
You love each other, you know that.

234
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,590
But you are too proud

235
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:18,840
to give in.

236
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,150
Don’t spend time on fighting.

237
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,200
Think about it,

238
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,440
will you make it up?

239
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:24,620
I…

240
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,400
You’re not young anymore.

241
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,000
You’ve kept each other waiting for years.

242
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,790
Now you still want that to continue?

243
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,110
Do you still want Shengzhe look at the foreign guy

244
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:34,200
on the photo and call him dad?

245
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,030
Jinzhi,

246
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,350
I owe you an apology.

247
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,280
Hum…

248
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,150
Tang,

249
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,320
go ahead.

250
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:57,590
Yes, yes.

251
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,110
Jinzhi, wait for me.

252
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,320
Chen Jinzhi,

253
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,470
wait for me.

254
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:09,110
We’ve been fighting for too long.

255
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:10,400
Time for a break.

256
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:12,640
Jinzhi,

257
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:13,640
Jin…

258
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,080
Go away!

259
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:21,760
That’s annoying.

260
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:22,910
Go away!

261
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:26,760
Jinzhi…

262
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,000
I said go away.

263
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:34,910
Jinzhi,

264
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:37,550
it was all my fault.

265
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,590
I’m sorry.

266
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:41,110
Now here comes your sorry.

267
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,350
Too late!

268
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:43,760
Let go of me.

269
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,840
Give me a chance,

270
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,350
I’ll make it up to Shengzhe,

271
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:47,440
and…

272
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,960
And you.

273
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,760
We don’t need you.

274
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,030
We are good.

275
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,470
I know you are mad at me.

276
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,200
Yes, you may not forgive me.

277
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,880
But I beg for your forgiveness

278
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,320
and I can do anything for that.

279
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,880
Actually the photo is not the point.

280
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:19,960
Actually, I am regretful.

281
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,230
I regret most that

282
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,230
I left you.

283
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,470
But it is the photo

284
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,440
that gives me a push.

285
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:31,540
It tells me that

286
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:35,020
I can’t just put the regret in my heart.

287
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,960
I must do something

288
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,640
to bring you and Shengzhe back.

289
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,200
Jinzhi,

290
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,590
I beg you,

291
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,520
give me one more chance.

292
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,710
Are you serious?

293
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,980
Should Tang tell a word that’s a lie,

294
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,140
may he be tortured in hell…

295
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,760
No, save it.

296
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:01,400
You’d stay in the world
and beg for my forgiveness.

297
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:04,840
Does that mean

298
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:08,030
I have one more chance?

299
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,080
You have to win it.

300
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,280
It depends, depends.

301
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,200
Alright.

302
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,400
I myself will

303
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,440
deliver Shan Junhao the invitation.

304
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,110
He has to come here

305
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,670
and look at what we’ve done.

306
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,520
Hello, your access card.

307
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:44,910
I don’t work here.

308
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,470
But I have something important

309
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,200
for your general manager, Shan Junhao.

310
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,030
Sorry, miss.

311
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,400
You need a reservation.

312
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:51,320
Please leave it at the reception.

313
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,400
We’ll forward it.

314
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,280
No,

315
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,150
I must put this in his hand.

316
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,710
You need a reservation.

317
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,400
Please, an exception!

318
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,790
No, please leave.

319
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,910
Got it. OK.

320
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:11,230
- Dawei! - OK.

321
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,000
I’ve got to hang up.

322
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:14,000
What’s up?

323
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:14,960
Why are you here?

324
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,550
I have something important

325
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,910
for the general manager.

326
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,440
Could you tell him

327
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,230
to let me in?

328
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,400
Mr. Shan is not here.

329
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:23,910
Where is he?

330
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,880
In one week,

331
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,790
Guanmei Fishing Village will host

332
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,200
an event themed the meteor shower.

333
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,640
I want to invite Mr. Shan.

334
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,150
Please, please.

335
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,710
I must put the invitation in his hand.

336
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,230
Please, Dawei.

337
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:42,030
This is our last chance.

338
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:43,520
I understand

339
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,150
that Mr. Shan is a harsh man.

340
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,710
But, I have to

341
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,880
show him our good faith.

342
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:54,640
Mr. Shan is inspecting Senwell Hotel.

343
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,030
I’ll give you the address.

344
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,030
Thank you, Dawei.

345
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,200
Actually, Mr. Shan is a nice man.

346
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,400
He’s not that harsh,

347
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,520
or he would not have

348
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,880
given you one month,

349
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,280
not mentioning the piano.

350
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,110
Is it right?

351
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:08,640
Address sent.

352
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:10,110
Piano?

353
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,550
Yeah, you don’t know yet.

354
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:15,960
Mr. Shan gave you the piano.

355
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,520
That day,

356
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,000
Mr. Shan and I went to Guanmei

357
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,150
and saw you were on the piano

358
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,200
fighting to protect it.

359
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,440
He couldn’t bear it

360
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,080
and bought the piano for you.

361
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,400
I’ve got to go.

362
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:34,760
Yes.

363
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,350
It’s him.

364
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,500
= Purchasing Manager’s Office =

365
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,820
= Material Supply & Sales, Sep. =

366
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:58,320
We purchased 800 Boston Lobsters this month,

367
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,110
but only sold 268.

368
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,080
The stock was half full

369
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,320
but more supplies came.

370
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,920
The same happened to other expensive materials.

371
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,430
Can you explain this?

372
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:07,400
Mr. Shan,

373
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:09,710
it should be bookkeeping errors.

374
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,070
You came unnoticed

375
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:13,110
and I haven’t checked it yet.

376
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,590
You mean I have to

377
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:18,920
notice you before coming

378
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,640
so that you will modify the books?

379
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,760
Mr. Shan, it’s not like that.

380
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,880
There is no fraud in the hotel.

381
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,280
I’m checking it now.

382
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,280
You’re checking the books, aren’t you?

383
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,230
Why are you following me?

384
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,880
I’ll escort your visit.

385
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,560
Not necessary.

386
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,590
Check out what’s going on,

387
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:41,760
or resign yourself.

388
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:42,880
Yes.

389
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,020
May I have your room card, please?

390
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,060
That’s it.

391
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:52,700
Check it, please.

392
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,220
It’s done. Thank you.

393
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,100
It’s on the screen.

394
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:55,950
- Thanks. - Hope to see you again.

395
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:56,950
Hello.

396
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,560
Miss Ye has something important

397
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,430
for Mr. Shan.

398
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:01,680
Where is he?

399
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,400
He just went to B1 office.

400
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:05,560
Who is Miss Ye?

401
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,110
You don’t know Miss Ye?

402
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,710
Mr. Shan may fire you.

403
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,220
The subway station is 100 meters

404
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,260
on the left.

405
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,310
Who is Miss Ye?

406
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,430
I don’t know.

407
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,040
Neither do I.

408
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,940
= Material Supply & Sales, Sep. =

409
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,520
The general manager of Senwell Group

410
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,230
is checking the cold store by himself!

411
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,590
It can’t be true!

412
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,280
Why are you here?

413
00:19:58,710 --> 00:19:59,800
I need a talk with you.

414
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,110
Not necessary.

415
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,070
What do you want?

416
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,040
Are you making another scandal

417
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,590
or do you want hush money?

418
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,470
Don’t think everything has a price

419
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,590
because you are rich.

420
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,430
I came for Guanmei Inn.

421
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,190
I’ve given you a chance.

422
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,110
That’s the only topic between us.

423
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,310
In one week,

424
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,520
Guanmei Fishing Village will host

425
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,880
its first Tourism and Culture Festival.

426
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,800
This is the invitation.

427
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,310
I’m busy.

428
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,880
The designer of the Tourism and Culture Festival

429
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,880
is Tonghao.

430
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,190
It’s a shame

431
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,230
that he’s gone before finishing this.

432
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,680
We will make a good ending.

433
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,920
The Taurus meteor shower comes in a week.

434
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,230
Guanmei Fishing Village has the best view of it.

435
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:48,070
We’ve planned the details

436
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:50,470
and invited renowned media.

437
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,880
So, you must come, please.

438
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,590
It’s Tonghao’s wish.

439
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,640
It’s not only an invitation,

440
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,230
but our good faith.

441
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,560
Trust me,

442
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,140
I will honor my promise.

443
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,140
Guanmei Inn

444
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,000
will be the most special homestay.

445
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:33,980
= Cold Store =

446
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:38,400
- Hey! - Hey!

447
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,580
Open the door!

448
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,640
Open the door!

449
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,800
Hello!

450
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,920
OK. Save it.

451
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,280
This is a polyurethane gate made by

452
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,920
high press foaming,

453
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,710
of perfect sound and heat insulation.

454
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,110
They can’t hear you.

455
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,100
What…

456
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,000
What shall we do?

457
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,590
You’re the boss.

458
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,430
Tell them to open it.

459
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:07,760
No signal.

460
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:08,760
God!

461
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:11,430
Open the door!

462
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,710
There should be an alarm.

463
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,400
I’m afraid not.

464
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,710
Open the door!

465
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,280
Hello!

466
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,280
I… I’ll die here, right?

467
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,710
How about Mama Jinzhi?

468
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:31,190
And Shengzhe?

469
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:31,880
I don’t want to die.

470
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,880
Enough. Quiet!

471
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,190
I don’t want to die.

472
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,680
Could you please quiet down?

473
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,830
Let me think.

474
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:37,950
I can’t die!

475
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:41,580
I can’t die in here. Open it!

476
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,700
Open the door!

477
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,230
Tonghao.

478
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:50,280
Listen…

479
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,470
Do you know instinctive reaction?

480
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,110
Instinctive reaction is

481
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,590
the reaction you make

482
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:04,950
in emergent situation.

483
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,830
It does not imply anything.

484
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:08,760
It’s meaningless.

485
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,920
I just wanted you to calm down.

486
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,190
Calm down.

487
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,590
I know.

488
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:16,950
Don’t explain.

489
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,830
Shan Junhao doesn’t explain.

490
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:20,310
I didn’t explain.

491
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,680
I just hate you always try to

492
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,950
find Tonghao from me.

493
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:41,040
How about this?

494
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:41,880
Very beautiful!

495
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,950
♪ Good day ♪

496
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,110
Maybe to the left a little?

497
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,000
It’s fine.

498
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,420
Do it. I put it here.

499
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,880
As blue as the sky!

500
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,000
So nice.

501
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:51,590
Come over.

502
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:56,920
OK.

503
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,230
Jinzhi, thank you.

504
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,590
Don’t mention it.

505
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,230
It’s good to have you.

506
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,280
Li Donglu!

507
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:13,160
What are you doing out there?

508
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,830
I just find you’re busy

509
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,760
working in Guanmei Inn.

510
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,520
I guess I may give hands.

511
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:31,110
You traitor!

512
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,950
How dare you show up?

513
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:33,710
Listen,

514
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:35,190
we don’t need your help.

515
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,000
Take the money from Senwell

516
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,040
and enjoy your last days!

517
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,350
Uncle Donglu.

518
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:41,000
You have the right to choose,

519
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,400
but you chose

520
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,160
to harm us!

521
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:43,760
Yeah!

522
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,310
He doesn’t deserve to be here.

523
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:47,800
Shame on him!

524
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,110
Uncle Donglu, listen,

525
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:51,310
now, Senwell’s

526
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,760
development plan for Guanmei Inn

527
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,110
does not work.

528
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,160
I suggest you take care of the money.

529
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,190
I’m afraid it will be gone.

530
00:25:58,950 --> 00:25:59,400
Yeah.

531
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,180
Go, go.

532
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:00,710
Leave here.

533
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:01,860
- Go, go. - Leave, now!

534
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,220
Go!

535
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,230
I… I sold my house,

536
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,880
not my love to you.

537
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,110
I gave the money back.

538
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:10,310
I did give it back.

539
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,280
I just come here to help.

540
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,710
I’m not your enemy.

541
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,400
That’s not easy for Uncle Li.

542
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,920
Don’t embarrass him.

543
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,070
Cabriolet guy,

544
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,190
he’s not our guy anymore.

545
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,110
He’s a snob.

546
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,190
Don’t defend him.

547
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:33,310
- Yeah, Taichu. - Yeah.

548
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,590
You know what?

549
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:36,000
He won’t hesitate

550
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,280
to polish Shan Junhao’s shoes with his sleeves.

551
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:38,950
- Yeah. - Yeah.

552
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:40,280
We can’t blame him for

553
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,470
the different decision

554
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:42,590
he has made.

555
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,430
And,

556
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,560
I’m sure Uncle Li comes with a sincere heart.

557
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,400
Yes.

558
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:49,000
He doesn’t have a sincere heart.

559
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,040
He hardly has a heart.

560
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,230
Don’t believe him.

561
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:52,880
Shame on him.

562
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,040
OK, enough.

563
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:56,590
Li Donglu,

564
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:58,160
since you’ve come,

565
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:00,710
join us and see what you can help.

566
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:01,470
Yes.

567
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,800
- Butterball! - No.

568
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,950
It’s alright.

569
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:07,310
Harmony brings wealth.

570
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:09,280
Lose no time, guys.

571
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,560
Get to work.

572
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:13,110
Thank you, thank you.

573
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:13,590
Thank you all.

574
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,310
Come on. Back to our work.

575
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:16,470
Let me, let me help.

576
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,430
Why no one came to save us?

577
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,520
How could Senwell’s employee

578
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,800
lock the cold store without making sure

579
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,880
nobody in it?

580
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,160
Did you sign the paper

581
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,470
when you got in?

582
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,070
If you didn’t,

583
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:47,760
nobody is to be blamed.

584
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:49,310
You’re to be blamed.

585
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:52,070
An arrogant boss is to be blamed.

586
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:55,590
Are you teaching me?

587
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,710
I just don’t want another innocent

588
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:05,710
Senwell employee to be fired.

589
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,560
What does that mean?

590
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:11,160
Do you think I’m a ridiculous boss?

591
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:15,110
I heard Senwell has a high quit rate,

592
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,000
and Shan Junhao is a cruel boss.

593
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:19,310
I believe that

594
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:22,590
everyone makes mistakes

595
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:26,920
and shall be given a chance.

596
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,070
Even you

597
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:31,920
are locked in here because of your mistake.

598
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,760
But that doesn’t mean

599
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:35,310
you’re not a good boss.

600
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,760
I don’t need you to tell me how to be a boss.

601
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,230
Sorry.

602
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,350
I know

603
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:53,980
you actually have a soft heart.

604
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,920
Aren’t you cold?

605
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,760
Save it!

606
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:01,070
Ye Qianyu, you always bring me bad luck，
aren't you？

607
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,560
Each time I met you,

608
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,710
I dropped to water or got trapped.

609
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,000
And

610
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:11,950
car accident.

611
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,800
You’re right.

612
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:17,190
Each time we met, we met in a special way,

613
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:19,590
very special

614
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,400
and deadly.

615
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,160
I didn’t say that.

616
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:30,760
Seems

617
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,680
you did forget everything.

618
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,000
I said

619
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:41,470
don’t look at me in that way.

620
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:45,110
You commit Tonghao had existed?

621
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:53,680
I don’t care whether he existed or you made him,

622
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:55,830
he has nothing to do with me.

623
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,190
Don’t worry.

624
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:04,280
I won’t disturb you again.

625
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,640
What have gone are gone.

626
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,190
But

627
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,800
we are now partners.

628
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:16,560
Partners meet from time to time,

629
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,350
unless you return Guanmei Inn.

630
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:22,350
You’re indeed a chatterbox.

631
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:23,620
Oh.

632
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,040
Still no signal.

633
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:40,920
Do we have to wait till they

634
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,710
come to work tomorrow?

635
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,880
Are you cold?

636
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,710
Hello, Ziqian?

637
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:06,280
Found Junhao?

638
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,830
I searched every place Junhao

639
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:08,590
went to today.

640
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,640
The last place he showed up

641
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:11,760
was the hotel.

642
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,590
Yunyi, calm down.

643
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:15,280
I’m checking the hotel surveillance.

644
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,590
Junhao will be found.

645
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:17,710
OK.

646
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,590
Wake up! Wake up!

647
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,800
Where are we?

648
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:58,190
Don’t sleep.

649
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:00,640
You may keep talking.

650
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,520
You must stay awake.

651
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:08,950
I remember.

652
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:11,920
We’re trapped in the cold store.

653
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,590
You said I’m a chatterbox.

654
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,830
And you want me to chatter now.

655
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:25,830
Don’t sleep, or you’ll never wake up.

656
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,430
Keep talking to me.

657
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,680
Got it?

658
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,220
Come on.

659
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,160
Come on.

660
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,230
Get up.

661
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,710
Get up and move. Hop.

662
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:53,680
Stay awake.

663
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:56,110
I can’t hop.

664
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,230
Hop or die.

665
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:00,830
Please.

666
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,190
- Come on. - OK.

667
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:05,070
I can’t die.

668
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:07,560
I will guard Guanmei Inn.

669
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,470
Come, follow me.

670
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,630
Why are you laughing?

671
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,870
So,

672
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:26,120
you can hop as a frog.

673
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:28,190
I thought Shan Junhao

674
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,670
was cold to his bone.

675
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:44,430
You’re dying. Don’t make fun of me.

676
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,520
You’re dying, too.

677
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,000
I have company.

678
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:56,600
It’s weird.

679
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,430
Shouldn’t the general manager

680
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,840
have had a large company

681
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,080
in an inspection?

682
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,230
Why are you trapped here for two hours

683
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,800
without anyone noticing it?

684
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,470
Dawei was assigned another work.

685
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,190
He wasn’t with me.

686
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:14,040
The inspection is not on my schedule.

687
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:15,760
The hotel was not informed.

688
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:18,470
The purchasing manager thought I had left.

689
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,230
He didn’t know

690
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:23,360
I would check the cold store.

691
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,710
Why did you check it?

692
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,390
Senwell Hotel

693
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:31,560
reported deficit for three months in a row.

694
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,870
We found nothing wrong

695
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,190
from its financial statements.

696
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:36,390
So I had to come have a look.

697
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,800
You have too many questions.

698
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,190
You asked me to talk.

699
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:43,630
Can’t I have questions?

700
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:46,560
I came to check unnoticed

701
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:49,870
to find out what is wrong.

702
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,280
If they were noticed,

703
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,230
they’d give me modified statements.

704
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,080
Details are boring, aren’t they?

705
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:59,760
The devil is in the details.

706
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,800
Senwell Group

707
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,040
has many subsidiaries.

708
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,000
In some cases,

709
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,760
I have to put my hands on it

710
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,800
for efficiency.

711
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:14,390
Similar as the way I run the inn.

712
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:16,000
For the Tourism and Culture Festival,

713
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:17,560
from a cup mat

714
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:18,870
to the whole decoration,

715
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:20,430
I have to confirm everything.

716
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,520
So,

717
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,040
please

718
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:30,840
come and have a look.

719
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:36,430
Let's get out of here first.

720
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,560
Feeling better?

721
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:45,620
Boss,

722
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,740
= Tourism and Culture Festival =

723
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:49,520
where will the rollups and banners go?

724
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:53,560
Put them outside.

725
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:54,910
OK, yes.

726
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:56,560
Fengqiao, give me a hand.

727
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:57,390
Coming.

728
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,520
Wait for me.

729
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,360
Jinzhi,

730
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:12,710
this is my heart.

731
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:13,910
After these years,

732
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,560
could you forgive me?

733
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:26,670
You…

734
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:31,800
Witch.

735
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,230
Mama Jinzhi.

736
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:36,800
Why isn’t Qianyu back yet?

737
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,910
I called her and she’s out of service.

738
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,950
Fool girl.

739
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,190
She can’t be with that

740
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,320
Shan Junhao, right?

741
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,560
She was sending the invitation.

742
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:50,870
She’s clear we’re busy here.

743
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,360
She can’t stay for long.

744
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,670
Hope she’s not in trouble.

745
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:14,950
So cold.

746
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,230
Junhao!

747
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,000
Junhao!

748
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:11,390
Junhao!

749
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,150
Mr. Shan!

750
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,100
- Junhao! - Junhao!

751
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,470
Qianyu!

752
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,280
Junhao.

753
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:18,910
Junhao.

754
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:30,950
- Junhao. - Mr. Shan.

755
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,000
Junhao!

756
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:48,670
Go!

757
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,220
- Junhao. - Hurry!

758
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:53,380
Hurry!

759
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:57,120
Careful! Be careful!

760
00:39:59,000 --> 00:39:59,700
Here.

761
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:05,230
Wait!

762
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:06,120
Yeah.

763
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,520
Cover her. Cover her.

764
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,000
Qianyu.

765
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:11,910
You were frozen.

766
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:14,120
Feel better?

767
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:15,910
You know it?

768
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:17,080
I made it!

769
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:19,470
Shan Junhao took my invitation.

770
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:22,760
You were frozen.

771
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,870
Don’t talk.

772
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,600
We didn’t know you were in the cold store

773
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,520
until I called Xu Ziqian.

774
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,320
What a fool you are!

775
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,390
You work too hard!

776
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,150
I’m fine.

777
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,120
I’m a strong little woman.

778
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,120
Give me a little energy

779
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,760
and I get fully recovered.

780
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:05,630
It’s beautiful.

781
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:08,360
Su Liyin, I need your help.

782
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,320
I can’t hear you.

783
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,910
Playing your phone again?

784
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,630
Are you sharing moments?

785
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,120
When you do that,

786
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,390
could you casually think of me?

787
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:22,870
Or I doubt you and I are

788
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:24,230
fair-weather friends.

789
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:26,470
You make yourself look like a coquette

790
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:28,080
and me a pie face.

791
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,430
That costs time.

792
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:33,000
Fengqiao,

793
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,520
I would say a hamburger.

794
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,840
Go to hell!

795
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:38,390
I’m just kidding.

796
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,800
Go to hell!

797
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,360
Gosh!

798
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,380
Come over and look at this.

799
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:47,940
- What? - What’s it?

800
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,020
Come over!

801
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:51,760
Taichu posted a blog,

802
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:55,280
with millions of comments and shares.

803
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:57,000
What blog?

804
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:57,710
Show me.

805
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:58,430
Look,

806
00:41:58,630 --> 00:41:59,800
it says

807
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,180
the best place to view

808
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:04,630
Taurus meteor shower is Guanmei Inn.

809
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:08,470
Taichu is awesome.

810
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,190
He posts a blog and

811
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:12,470
millions of people know Guanmei Inn.

812
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,360
He’s the ambassador of Guanmei Inn.

813
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,600
He is.

814
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:19,950
Taichu is a globally renowned traveler.

815
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:21,390
He has many followers.

816
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:24,280
I know he’s the man of my type.

817
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,120
Liyin,

818
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,190
Taichu loves Qianyu.

819
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:29,910
He’s not yours.

820
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:32,040
Consider me.

821
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,710
Are you ready?

822
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:34,430
Taichu.

823
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:36,040
- Ready for what? - Taichu.

824
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:37,800
Guanmei Fishing Village

825
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,600
will receive large visitor flow

826
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,040
during the first Tourism and Culture Festival.

827
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,230
We must get ready for the hospitality.

828
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,910
There won’t be many of them.

829
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:46,470
I’ve been working here for years.

830
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:48,150
We had a hundred at most in peak time.

831
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,230
We’re ready for this.

832
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:57,950
Hello, this is Guanmei Inn.

833
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:00,670
A reservation for 12th of the month?

834
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:03,080
How many rooms, please?

835
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:05,910
Twelve rooms?

836
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,390
OK, yes, Mr. Li.

837
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:08,800
Twelve rooms!

838
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:10,470
So many!

839
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:14,800
Hello, this is Guanmei Inn.

840
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:16,670
A reservation for 12th of the month?

841
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:19,910
How many rooms, please?

842
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:22,040
Eight rooms?

843
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:23,260
OK, yes, Mr. Wang.

844
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:24,390
- Eight rooms! - Eight!

845
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:25,360
Twelve…

846
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:28,150
Twelve plus eight…

847
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,520
Hello, this is Guanmei Inn.

848
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,390
A reservation for 12th?

849
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,840
The meteors come at night,

850
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,080
so, many visitors need accommodation.

851
00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:40,390
According to the reservation calls,

852
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:42,670
all rooms of Guanmei Inn have been ordered.

853
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,470
But, we are short of hands.

854
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:46,910
Everyone will be in position,

855
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:48,320
or in positions.

856
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,360
Tang will take care of this.

857
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,190
You’ll make job arrangements.

858
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,870
Sure, no problem.

859
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:55,800
Master has

860
00:43:55,870 --> 00:43:57,040
worked out the menu

861
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:57,760
for the media professionals.

862
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:00,120
Liyin will confirm with each of them

863
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,040
to know their

864
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:03,360
likes and dislikes,

865
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:04,670
and collect feedbacks

866
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:05,910
to finalize the menu.

867
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,080
Ah,

868
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:07,710
is Qianyu

869
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:08,390
alright?

870
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:09,600
She’s fine.

871
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:11,390
She’s not hurt.

872
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:12,520
She needs rest.

873
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:14,320
I will update Qianyu

874
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,150
on our progresses.

875
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:17,320
OK, get to work, everyone.

876
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:19,080
- Yes. - Yes.

877
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,080
Go, go, go!

878
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,800
Go, go, go!

879
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,390
Why are you still here?

880
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:30,800
