11
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:49,480
What are you looking at?

12
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,270
The Milky Way.

13
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:55,940
Look.

14
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,950
Altair and Vega are separated by it.

15
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,360
But when the cowboy and the weaver girl met,

16
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,400
he didn’t know

17
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,760
she was a fairy in heaven.

18
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,270
Had they known the consequence

19
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:12,270
of their love,

20
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,360
what would they’ve chosen in the beginning?

21
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,470
Still, they chose to be together eventually.

22
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:27,960
I never thought

23
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,000
you’d be Shan Junhao.

24
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,630
You can call me Tonghao

25
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,080
or Shan Junhao,

26
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,800
but I’ve never changed.

27
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:59,160
Shan Junhao is a billionaire.

28
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,110
Doesn’t Mama Jinzhi want that kind of son-in-law?

29
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,060
From now on, she won’t stop us

30
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,470
from seeing each other.

31
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,750
But Shan Junhao has a fiancée.

32
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,360
I don’t remember anything about her.

33
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,390
To me,

34
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,270
she’s nothing but a stranger.

35
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,190
I don’t want to be Shan Junhao.

36
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,440
I prefer to be Tonghao,

37
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,600
a grocery seller who lost his memory.

38
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,390
Tonghao’s life begins

39
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,670
when he met a girl

40
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,910
named Ye Qianyu.

41
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,440
Tonghao only lost his memory

42
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,190
because of Ye Qianyu.

43
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,440
She hit you with her car,

44
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,080
causing your memory loss.

45
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,040
She didn’t call the police

46
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,880
and gave you a fake identity.

47
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,270
How could you be so calm?

48
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,000
I know nothing

49
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,350
about the past or the future.

50
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,040
What I do know is

51
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,640
I love you.

52
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,640
That’s enough.

53
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,230
Taichu.

54
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:50,880
Sorry,

55
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,040
I’m late.

56
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:52,920
I just finished my delivery.

57
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:54,790
It’s OK.

58
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:57,110
Take your time. I’ll always wait for you.

59
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:59,670
So, what’s up?

60
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,070
I’m leaving.

61
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,790
Going to travel again?

62
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,980
Yes.

63
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,950
I’ve been here for far too long.

64
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,480
Where are you going?

65
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,440
South America.

66
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,040
When will you come back?

67
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:18,000
Maybe I'll never come back.

68
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,000
Actually, my departure is long overdue.

69
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,110
I met someone here,

70
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,830
so I decided to stop.

71
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Qianyu,

72
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,550
you’re the most outgoing, diligent

73
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,040
and optimistic girl I’ve ever met.

74
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,270
I hope

75
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,920
you’ll always be like this.

76
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,640
If you get upset someday,

77
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,480
don’t forget you still have me as your friend.

78
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,880
Remember to update your Moments.

79
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,270
I’ll read all your posts.

80
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:53,720
Someday,

81
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,200
if you want to see the world outside,

82
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:58,920
you can call me.

83
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,920
If one day,

84
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,070
you’re tired on the way and want to rest,

85
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:06,160
you can come back.

86
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,040
We’ll all miss you.

87
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,720
I’ll miss you, too.

88
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:36,900
Hey, handsome,

89
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,040
don’t forget to update your blog.

90
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,670
I’ll keep following you.

91
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,760
After you leave,

92
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,880
the face score of our hotel

93
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,880
will plunge.

94
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,790
I’ll try to keep it up,

95
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,950
but I’ll still miss you.

96
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,440
Bring it for the trip.

97
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,230
You won’t forget the taste

98
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,270
and will come back for more.

99
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,580
Thanks.

100
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,670
Mama Jinzhi wants you to have this talisman.

101
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,320
Travel safe.

102
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,820
Thanks.

103
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,480
Don’t forget your promise.

104
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,070
You came this late

105
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:33,110
not to enjoy the view with me, right?

106
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,230
Do you love her?

107
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,400
Of course.

108
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:52,380
What about you?

109
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,440
Well, she loves you.

110
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,960
I know.

111
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:16,790
Can you promise me

112
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,000
that you’ll protect her forever

113
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,350
no matter who you are?

114
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,790
Why should I promise you that?

115
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:39,910
Because if you can’t,

116
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:43,790
I’ll do it.

117
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,350
Actually I will protect her ever

118
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,760
no matter you are here or not.

119
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,400
That’s all I need to hear.

120
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,320
I’m leaving tomorrow.

121
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:18,000
Please make her happy.

122
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:30,710
I will.

123
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,590
I’m leaving.

124
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,030
Just stay.

125
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,550
I’m used to traveling alone.

126
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:12,880
Why people have to separate?

127
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,230
With me here,

128
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,440
don’t think of other men again.

129
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:57,760
What are you doing?

130
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,520
To make us jealous?

131
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,040
- Let’s go. - Let’s go.

Junhao!

135

Is it really you?

136
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,350
I’m so glad you’re fine.

137
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:57,520
Miss.

138
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,320
How can I help you?

139
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,550
What did you call me?

140
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,470
You really don’t remember me?

141
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,400
I’m Yunyi.

142
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:15,880
Do we...

143
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,670
know each other?

144
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,710
Of course we do.

145
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,150
We grew up together.

146
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,150
I’m your fiancée.

147
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:51,320
Junhao,

148
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,550
ever since you went missing,

149
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:58,110
not a day goes by that I don’t miss you.

150
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:01,320
I keep looking for you.

151
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,470
I can’t sleep at all.

152
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,590
How could you forget about me?

153
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,440
I’m sorry.

154
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,520
Did you mistake me for someone else?

155
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,760
I don’t have a fiancée.

156
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,200
I only have a girlfriend

157
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,550
named Ye Qianyu.

158
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,520
She isn’t your girlfriend.

159
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,280
Look at this ring.

160
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:42,520
You gave me this engagement ring.

161
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:44,710
You said

162
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,550
it was once for a lifetime.

163
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,520
You really don’t remember?

164
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,590
I don’t.

165
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:13,520
Junhao!

166
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,150
It’s OK.

167
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,110
You simply lost your memory.

168
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,640
Let’s go back.

169
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,880
We’ll find the best doctor

170
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,840
to help you regain your memory.

171
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:28,880
I have memory.

172
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,280
Sorry, I gotta go.

173
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,620
Junhao!

174
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:42,150
Junhao!

175
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:44,470
Junhao!

176
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:48,660
Yunyi!

177
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,550
Are you OK?

178
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,840
Get up first.

179
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,400
Ziqian.

180
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,840
Junhao said he doesn’t remember me.

181
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,520
He’s forgotten about me.

182
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,760
How could he?

183
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,500
- How could he say... - I’m sorry.

184
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,040
Yunyi!

185
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,800
Ye Qianyu, you know

186
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:47,920
while he’s here,

187
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,920
how much trouble the company is facing?

188
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,070
While he’s here,

189
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:56,070
how serious the crisis his family is in?

190
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,400
While he’s here,

191
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:59,950
his father passed away without seeing him again.

192
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:01,880
It’s all because of you!

193
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:03,560
You keep him here.

194
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:06,470
Do you know the price we have paid?

195
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:09,680
I don’t know.

196
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:11,400
I swear I didn’t know he’s Shan Junhao.

197
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,280
Liar!

198
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:15,560
You didn’t know

199
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,760
so you kept him to yourself

200
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,800
while he was confused?

201
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,560
Ye Qianyu.

202
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,830
Is that fair to him,

203
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,430
to his family,

204
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:33,470
or to me?

205
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,520
No!

206
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,280
I never knew it’d turn out like this.

207
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,400
I’ll do anything

208
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,680
to make it up to you all.

209
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,400
Give Junhao back to me.

210
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,540
I...

211
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,020
I...

212
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,760
Give him back right now!

213
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:07,430
Please return him to me.

214
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,590
I...

215
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,430
Give Junhao back to me.

216
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,680
Give Junhao back!

217
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,310
Give him back.

218
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,190
Give Junhao back!

219
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:18,710
Yunyi!

220
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:19,660
Yunyi!

221
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,830
Calm down.

222
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,920
Give Junhao some time.

223
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,950
Let’s tell Aunt Jiang

224
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,710
Junhao is fine. He’s still alive.

225
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,800
Let’s go back, OK?

226
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:58,400
Ye Qianyu.

227
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,400
Junhao has his career,

228
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,070
his family,

229
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:06,230
and his fiancée.

230
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,430
He doesn’t belong here.

231
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,430
Nor does he belong to you.

232
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,140
Mom.

233
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:05,920
You’re back.

234
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,980
Mom.

235
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,520
Junhao is still alive.

236
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,590
Darling,

237
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,470
I know

238
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,280
you’re in sorrow lately,

239
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,830
but we all

240
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,470
have to face reality.

241
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,700
Mom.

242
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:02,560
It’s true.

243
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,760
We saw him.

244
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,590
Right, Ziqian?

245
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:09,230
Yes.

246
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,070
Yunyi didn’t lie.

247
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,190
Junhao is still alive.

248
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,950
Is it

249
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,710
true?

250
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,920
Why didn’t you bring him back?

251
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,520
How is he?

252
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,000
Is he OK?

253
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:40,380
Aunt Jiang,

254
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,920
Junhao is fine.

255
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,280
We didn’t bring him back

256
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,460
because he needs a little preparation

257
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,680
before coming back to you.

258
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,830
Where was he?

259
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,680
What happened to him?

260
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,280
Why didn’t he come home?

261
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,020
He...

262
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,280
Speak!

263
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,470
He was hit by a car, fell into the sea,

264
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,920
and then ended up on a desert island.

265
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:12,560
A ship passing by found him

266
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,070
and brought him back.

267
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:16,680
Hit by a car.

268
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,590
Was he injured?

269
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,950
Was it bad?

270
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,510
- No, no.
- That’s why you couldn’t bring him back.

271
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:22,680
He’s in hospital, right?

272
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,740
- Which one? - He’s OK.

273
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,190
- Aunt Jiang. - Take me there now!

274
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:24,460
Mom!

275
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,910
- Take me there now! - Calm down, Aunt Jiang.

276
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,200
- Mom, he’s fine. - He’s fine.

277
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,250
- He’s OK. - He’s OK.

278
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:29,800
Mom.

279
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:31,880
Junhao is fine.

280
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:36,470
He... He just…

281
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:40,000
His mustache and hair are too long,

282
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,710
so he wants to tidy himself up

283
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:44,040
before coming back.

284
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,310
You didn’t lie?

285
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,040
Is it

286
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,830
all true?

287
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:06,300
He’s fine.

288
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,760
That’s great.

289
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,760
Junhao is fine.

290
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,560
I’m relieved.

291
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:41,640
No stars tonight.

292
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,800
Stars are the eyes of hope.

293
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,400
Hope is gone,

294
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,760
so stars become dim.

295
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,590
What’s on your mind?

296
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:55,920
Tonghao,

297
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,040
ever since I met you

298
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:00,880
I knew

299
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:05,280
you’d leave me one day.

300
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,920
Everything happened here

301
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,520
would only be a footnote in your life.

302
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:12,680
Even so,

303
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,400
I still fell in love with you.

304
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:22,230
I even wish you’d never regain your memory.

305
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,640
That way, you’d be with me forever.

306
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:28,800
Qianyu,

307
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:31,680
I’ll never leave you.

308
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,830
But your family needs you.

309
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:42,950
I don’t remember them.

310
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,160
They’re strangers to me.

311
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,640
All I know is you.

312
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:51,430
Guanmei is my home.

313
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,760
Isn’t it cruel to your family?

314
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,950
They’ve found you after so much effort.

315
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,520
You really don’t want to go back?

316
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:05,950
You want me to leave?

317
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:09,280
If not, you won’t leave?

318
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,160
What about your mom,

319
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:13,070
your fiancée,

320
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,470
or your company?

321
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,110
They have nothing to do with me.

322
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,950
But you belong to them.

323
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,430
Qianyu,

324
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,680
I won’t leave.

325
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:35,160
I’ll stay with you,

326
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,470
stay in Guanmei.

327
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:38,470
You don’t belong here.

328
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,400
You didn’t, you don’t

329
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,590
and you won’t.

330
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,280
Qianyu!

331
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,830
What’s going on between them?

332
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,000
Something is wrong since last night.

333
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,310
They didn’t seem to have argued.

334
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,280
They do have a serious problem, though.

335
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:34,950
Qianyu,

336
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:37,880
let’s go out on a date.

337
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,710
You completely shattered my dream

338
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:54,520
of marrying Qianyu to a rich man.

339
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,430
Jinzhi,

340
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:00,830
there’s something you don’t know.

341
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,640
What's that?

342
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:07,160
He hid 300 yuan

343
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,680
under his pillow in the warehouse.

344
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,110
I know everything.

345
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:15,070
That’s for the date.

346
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:16,430
Mama Jinzhi.

347
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:18,310
Thank you for not taking it away.

348
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,280
I’m done.

349
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:20,110
I’ll go move the goods.

350
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:23,560
I’ll go with you.

351
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,640
I said

352
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,310
I’ll do this kind of work in the future.

353
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,760
There’s no future between us.

354
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:48,950
Qianyu!

355
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:00,160
Development of Guanmei Fishing Village

356
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,520
can’t be terminated for a few white dolphins.

357
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:04,280
Senwell has invested a lot

358
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,430
in this project.

359
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,590
Protecting endangered animals

360
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,560
is only those greedy villagers’ pretext

361
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,880
to stop us.

362
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:15,590
Our experts can prove

363
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,430
the development won’t

364
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,000
damage their habitat,

365
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:22,040
but can protect it instead.

366
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:23,850
- Mr. Zhang is right. - Right.

367
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:24,920
- That’s right. - If that’s the case,

368
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:27,560
let’s get a move on.

369
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,040
Before that,

370
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,310
I have an important announcement to make.

371
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,760
Director Xu.

372
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,160
Don’t bluff.

373
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:42,310
What could be more important than our project?

374
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,350
Shan Junhao is back.

375
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:49,070
- What? - How come?

376
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:49,880
Why is he suddenly back?

377
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,820
- This… - Yeah, why is he suddenly back?

378
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:51,540
It... It can’t...

379
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:57,590
Who’d know

380
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,680
Shan Junhao survived?

381
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:02,830
Didn’t they say

382
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:06,070
he went missing after the car accident?

383
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:07,880
Yeah.

384
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,950
I’ve had people look into it.

385
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,920
What if he can’t come back?

386
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,000
What do you mean, Mr. Qiu?

387
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:23,950
Mr. Zhang,

388
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,350
Mr. Qiu means

389
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,560
since Shan Junhao went missing once,

390
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,680
we can make it twice.

391
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,920
We’re businessmen,

392
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:41,470
not mafias.

393
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,400
I’m warning you.

394
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:45,640
Don’t do anything dirty.

395
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:47,760
I always

396
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:49,640
compete fair and square.

397
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,800
So what if he’s back?

398
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,680
GM of Senwell is still me,

399
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:57,760
Zhang Minghan.

400
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:46,920
Why are you sitting here alone?

401
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:53,470
I was rude to you last night and just now.

402
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,160
Please forgive me.

403
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:55,800
I’m sorry.

404
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:59,310
You apologized to me?

405
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,660
Hmm.

406
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,920
That’s it?

407
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:09,400
Saying sorry isn’t enough.

408
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,070
What more do you want?

409
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:16,160
I have an idea

410
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,110
that can help you make it up to me.

411
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:21,280
What is it?

412
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,640
Other than an apology, I have nothing else.

413
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:28,680
Let’s go on a date.

414
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,470
You’re still thinking about that?

415
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:36,350
Don’t forget

416
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,800
I stole you away from your family.

417
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,590
Tang didn’t tell you your real identity.

418
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:43,560
You should hate us.

419
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,400
How I feel

420
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:46,470
is my freedom.

421
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:49,230
Will you go out with me now?

422
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:53,310
We belong to different worlds.

423
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,710
You should go home.

424
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:55,950
Your family is waiting for you.

425
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,520
I won’t.

426
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,680
I won’t leave you.

427
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,000
I only want to be with you.

428
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:05,230
Tonghao,

429
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:07,230
if one day, you went missing,

430
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,710
I couldn’t imagine

431
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,920
how devastated and helpless I’d feel.

432
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,070
I’d wait for you to come back all the time.

433
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,230
How I’d feel

434
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,710
is how your family is feeling right now.

435
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:17,520
Do you understand?

436
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:21,520
But I have no memory of them.

437
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,430
I only remember you.

438
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:27,190
You lost your memory because of me.

439
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,880
Xu Ziqian said

440
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,950
before you hit me,

441
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,070
a car had knocked me

442
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:40,640
into the sea.

443
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,830
I think that accident

444
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,920
caused my memory loss.

445
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:47,430
Even if you hit me,

446
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:49,430
I wouldn’t blame you

447
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,520
because you brought me new memories,

448
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,190
incredible ones.

449
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,760
We’re meant to meet.

450
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,190
Don’t you think the way we met

451
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:06,230
is special?

452
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:08,910
You saved me twice.

453
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,430
Mathematically speaking,

454
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,470
I still owe you one life.

455
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:18,040
You really don’t resent me?

456
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:27,760
You know what,

457
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:31,040
when I went to see the doctor,

458
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,520
he said

459
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,120
I could recover by surgery,

460
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,390
but I didn’t do it.

461
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:42,600
Why?

462
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,280
I’m indeed curious about my past,

463
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:49,840
but for a person who lost his memory,

464
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,670
the past

465
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:54,150
is gone.

466
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,520
It’s insignificant.

467
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,670
Right now,

468
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,430
you’re the most important to me.

469
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,190
Hadn’t you brought me back,

470
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,120
a car would’ve run over and killed me.

471
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,630
Had you thrown me out,

472
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,760
I would’ve ended up in a sweatshop.

473
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,060
Qianyu,

474
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,950
don’t abase yourself

475
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,870
only to force me out.

476
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:31,470
I know you.

477
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:35,760
I want to see the real Qianyu.

478
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,360
She’s kindhearted,

479
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:41,150
adorable

480
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,870
and the love of my life.

481
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,000
If one day,

482
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:53,870
I hated you,

483
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:57,280
there could be only one reason.

484
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:01,870
That is you don’t love me anymore.

485
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:09,760
Tonghao,

486
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,320
why are you so nice to me?

487
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:16,040
Because...

488
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,390
Because I love you.

They say merry-go-round isn’t for couples.

521
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,760
How come?

522
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,120
If one sits at the front and the other back,

523
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,910
the horses go round and round,

524
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,630
you’ll only see each other’s backs

525
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:17,950
and can never catch up.

526
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:21,120
If they sit next to each other,

527
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:24,360
it seems that we move in the same direction,

528
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:27,910
but we’ll never cross paths.

529
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:30,320
So

530
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,040
this game means

531
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:33,840
to wait,

532
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,950
and to be distant.

533
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:45,230
Qianyu.

534
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,230
I’ll let you in on a secret.

535
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,040
What is it?

536
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,300
Come closer.

537
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:08,630
The gap is closed.

538
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,120
Tonghao,

539
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,600
promise me

540
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,000
that you’ll be happy like this forever.

541
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:29,120
Of course.

542
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:30,870
With you by my side,

543
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,320
I’ll never be sad.

544
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:33,940
Also,

545
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,910
don’t ever frown again.

546
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:37,950
You look so old when you do that.

547
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:39,670
Like this?

548
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,080
One... One more time,

549
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,230
and I’ll iron your forehead.

550
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:48,840
Your kiss is the best iron.

551
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:54,220
I haven’t had enough fun.

552
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,360
You look so sweet together.

553
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:56,560
This is your photo.

554
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,190
You should keep it.

555
00:40:58,950 --> 00:40:59,840
I will if it’s free.

556
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:02,380
How much?

557
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:02,910
30.

558
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,630
What?

559
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:05,740
30.

560
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:06,840
30?

561
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:09,000
I only charge 20 taking photos on the beach.

562
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,150
You asked for 30?

563
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:11,560
I thought I was greedy enough.

564
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,840
You’re worse than me!

565
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,300
Here you are.

566
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,420
Thanks.

567
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:29,760
Let’s go.

568
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,320
Welocme your next coming.

569
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,800
I’ll charge 30, too.

570
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:03,910
Qianyu.

571
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,320
Here’s a gift for you.

572
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,630
What gift?

573
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:09,940
Look.

574
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:17,190
“Ye Qianyu can punch Tonghao”.

575
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:20,360
“Tonghao will wash Ye Qianyu’s feet”.

576
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,390
These are wish cards.

577
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,800
Many are still blank.

578
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:28,040
You can write down your wishes.

579
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,600
I’ll realize them all.

580
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:50,980
= All Tonghao’s money belongs to Ye Qianyu =

581
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:58,470
“All Tonghao’s money belongs to Ye Qianyu”.

582
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:03,520
Sure.

583
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,430
There’s one last step.

584
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:16,630
Here.

585
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,390
Sign with your thumb.

586
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:23,320
Then they’ll come into effect.

587
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:27,860
= All Tonghao’s money belongs to Ye Qianyu =

588
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:31,020
= Tonghao will take care of Ye Qianyu forever =

589
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:35,100
= Tonghao can gain one sweet kiss from Ye Qianyu =

590
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:36,100
Done.

591
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,950
This is the first wish to come true.

592
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:51,780
= Tonghao can gain one sweet kiss from Ye Qianyu =

593
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,080
Tonghao,

594
00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:49,470
I feel I’m the happiest girl in the world.

595
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:51,390
I guess

596
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:53,840
even when I reach 100,

597
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:55,520
my hair turns gray,

598
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:57,000
my memory becomes bad,

599
00:44:57,710 --> 00:44:59,000
I’m too weak to move

600
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:02,040
and can only sit in a rocking chair in the sun,

601
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:04,230
when I think of this moment,

602
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:05,950
I can still feel the happiness.

603
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:09,150
Is this your confession of love?

604
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:12,710
Can you say that again?

605
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:15,000
Tonghao,

606
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:17,910
I love you!

607
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,520
Even when I’m 100,

608
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:32,430
I won’t forget your confession.

609
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:02,190
Tonghao,

610
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,230
let’s play a game.

611
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:05,600
OK.

612
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:07,580
What do you want to play?

613
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:13,760
I’ll

614
00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:16,150
blindfold myself.

615
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:19,190
Usually,

616
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:21,430
people get scared when they can’t see.

617
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:24,430
But it’s different if someone they trust

618
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:25,630
is next to them.

619
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:29,280
So this is a trust game.

620
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,870
You’re my eyes now.

621
00:46:32,470 --> 00:46:34,360
I’ll go wherever you lead me to.

622
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:35,500
OK?

623
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:37,620
Sure.

624
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,150
Alright. Let’s go.

625
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:54,380
Qianyu,

626
00:46:54,870 --> 00:46:55,950
why this game all of a sudden?

627
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:58,870
No particular reason. Just wanna have a try.

628
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:06,760
Can you tell me how you found this ring?

629
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:12,280
I found it on the beach.

630
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:14,710
Back then, you said it was yours

631
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:15,800
and tried to grab it.

632
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:18,150
Why did I do that?

633
00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:20,000
Don’t know.

634
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:22,670
I thought you were a conman.

635
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:26,230
But if you’re Shan Junhao,

636
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:29,710
you wouldn’t do that for no reason.

637
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:31,520
So

638
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:34,150
this ring is probably yours.

639
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:37,390
It’s fate

640
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:40,040
that you found it.

641
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:48,390
This must be your gift for Fan Yunyi.

642
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:10,150
I’ve tried but can’t take it off.

643
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:11,560
It’s weird.

644
00:48:11,870 --> 00:48:13,800
It seems to have grown on me.

645
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:19,840
When true love appears,

646
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,360
this ring will lock your finger

647
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:24,670
and can never be taken off.

648
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:26,470
What did you say?

649
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:30,630
I don’t know.

650
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:33,320
It just came to me.

651
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:36,660
Alright.

652
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:37,600
You can stop.

653
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,390
If it’s Shan Junhao’s ring,

654
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:42,280
it must be expensive.

655
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:49,180
Right.

656
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:55,910
I’ll keep it then.

657
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:01,900
Qianyu.

658
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:04,560
Look me in the eye.

659
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:07,910
No matter who I was

660
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:09,910
or what I did,

661
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:12,840
from this moment on,

662
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,630
I’ll only be your Tonghao.
