11
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,890
Tonghao,

12
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,260
can we stop Senwell in this way?

13
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,220
I am sure I saw Chinese white dolphin last time.

14
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,320
I have checked it.

15
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,620
Chinese white dolphin is a first class
national protected animal

16
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,580
and an endangered species.

17
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,260
It is honored as the aquatic giant panda.

18
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,820
So long as we prove

19
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,380
there is Chinese white dolphin
at Guanmei Fishing Village,

20
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,340
we can stop the commercial development of Senwell

21
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,160
in the name of protecting endangered wild animals.

22
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,000
Great idea!

23
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:20,840
But we don’t see any Chinese white dolphins today.

24
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,950
Normally, white dolphins will jump

25
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:24,450
out of water surface in good weathers.

26
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,270
But it is cloudy today.

27
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,660
I am afraid we have to go into water.

28
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,560
How can you go into water? You can’t swim.

29
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,560
I can’t swim. But I can dive.

30
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,100
I have checked

31
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,090
how to dive and the precautions

32
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,770
in details beforehand.

33
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:41,710
I can dive.

34
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:42,640
I will search for them underwater

35
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,740
and you can wait for me onshore.

36
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,760
Maybe the white dolphins

37
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,520
will jump out of water.

38
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:49,720
No.

39
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,440
It is enough to have one person onshore.

40
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:53,370
It is quicker if we have two people underwater.

41
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,560
No.

42
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,740
It is too dangerous.

43
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,120
Don’t worry, Qianyu.

44
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,810
White dolphins won’t enter

45
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,630
any sea area deeper than 25 meters,

46
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,560
nor will us.

47
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,880
So we must hurry up.

48
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:05,950
Let’s go.

49
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,570
Take care.

50
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,050
OK.

51
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,010
Chen Jinzhi,

52
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:25,680
don’t you feel tired?

53
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,120
Of course, I do.

54
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,510
Butterball,

55
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,560
you really made me exhausted.

56
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:39,560
Come down here.

57
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,350
Why did you throw it away?

58
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,570
Return us the contract.

59
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,980
Don’t go too far.

60
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,270
Don’t throw away.

61
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,170
Don’t throw away.

62
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,120
Don’t make a fuss.

63
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,980
Take care.

64
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,020
Beware of safety.

65
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:05,870
Good luck to us.

66
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,560
May we find Chinese white dolphin.

67
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,920
Stop throwing.

68
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,470
It is enough.

69
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:15,310
Stop throwing.

70
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,260
Use talks.

71
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:19,390
Come down right away.

72
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,440
Beat him.

73
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,150
Don’t make a fuss.

74
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,200
Calm down. No more fighting.

75
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:31,680
Stop throwing.

76
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:32,860
Zhang Minghan,

77
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,930
I told you not to take compulsory actions.

78
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,200
It is in chaos now.

79
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,070
How will you address it?

80
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,160
Take it easy.

81
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,830
There will be a perfect ending soon.

82
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,380
The situation is out of control now.

83
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,320
How can you feel at ease

84
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,510
and sit here drinking coffee?

85
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,330
Is it out of control?

86
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:50,510
It is all under my control.

87
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,570
Is it necessary to fuel the villagers
against Tang Shunming?

88
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:54,980
Xu Ziqian,

89
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,530
your indecisiveness has prevented us from finding

90
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,330
a good solution to the issue of Guanmei Inn.

91
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,250
Tang Shunming won’t hold on for long.

92
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:02,680
I already promised Tang Shunming

93
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,010
a grace period of one month.

94
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,530
Return with your people right away.

95
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:07,780
Xu Ziqian,

96
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,300
a board resolution has been passed

97
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,710
on Guanmei Inn.

98
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,440
You are just the interim chairman.

99
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:15,000
You can’t overturn a board resolution.

100
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,100
I already reached an agreement with Tang Shunming.

101
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,400
But you are taking compulsory actions now.

102
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,480
If it is disclosed to the media,

103
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,040
your position as general manager will be in danger.

104
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:25,960
Xu Ziqian,

105
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,090
I have a question for you specifically.

106
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,620
Why have you always blocked me

107
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,710
from promoting the project of Guanmei Inn?

108
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:32,820
I don’t mean to block the project.

109
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,150
I just object to your development mode.

110
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,630
Listen,

111
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,100
it is not a compulsory action.

112
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,060
Tang Shunming will voluntarily

113
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:40,880
surrender it.

114
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,170
That is too much.

115
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:42,900
Chen,

116
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,410
catch it.

117
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,280
Beat him, beat him!

118
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,280
Stop throwing.

119
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,380
Stop throwing.

120
00:05:58,590 --> 00:05:59,500
Stop it!

121
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,790
Stop!

122
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:03,780
Give it to us.

123
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,000
Smash him.

124
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:16,800
Come down.

125
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,240
Smash him.

126
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,740
Calm down.

127
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,020
Stop throwing.

128
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,490
Stop it.

129
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,760
Chen Jinzhi,

130
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,130
who are you supporting?

131
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:31,580
Only I am qualified

132
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,570
to beat him.

133
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,050
Mr. Tang!

134
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,130
Boss!

135
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,190
Are you OK?

136
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:53,880
What a heavy blow!

137
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,470
Tang Shunming.

138
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:58,940
Tang Shunming, are you OK?

139
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,460
Call the ambulance right away!

140
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,730
Hurry up, call the ambulance right away.

141
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,410
Emergency!

142
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,070
Yes.

143
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,100
Tonghao! Tonghao!

144
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,040
Taichu! Taichu!

145
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:30,980
We got it!

146
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:32,950
Tonghao!

147
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,300
Dear villagers,

148
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:00,640
I would say

149
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:03,340
I am reluctant to give up Guanmei Inn

150
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:05,950
more than

151
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,660
Guanmei Fishing Village.

152
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:10,840
Everything here, such as

153
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:12,510
the sky,

154
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:13,720
and the sea,

155
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,720
is so valuable to me.

156
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,560
I can’t imagine

157
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,940
a life far away from Guanmei.

158
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,810
It is our home.

159
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,520
But you don’t feel sorry at all to sell it.

160
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,010
Is Guanmei

161
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,760
valueless and worthless

162
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:33,610
to you all?

163
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,400
It sounds right.

164
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:39,630
Once Senwell

165
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:43,580
turns Guanmei Fishing Village
into the backyard of the rich,

166
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:45,800
your home

167
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,130
will become their home

168
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,170
and we will never return.

169
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,340
Yes.

170
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,300
Zhang Minghan

171
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,590
put so much money

172
00:08:58,610 --> 00:08:59,530
on the table today

173
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,680
just to stimulate us

174
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,160
and turn you against me together.

175
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,520
Of course,

176
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,750
I don’t have the power

177
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,640
to keep you here.

178
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,490
You can leave,

179
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,370
but I won’t.

180
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,320
So long as I am still alive,

181
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,440
I will stand here

182
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,030
until I die.

183
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:35,050
Come.

184
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:37,590
Take care.

185
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:38,750
Are you finished?

186
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:41,100
Tonghao, slow down.

187
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,310
Take care.

188
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,200
Tonghao!

189
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,090
Tonghao!

190
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,080
Tonghao!

191
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:04,590
Tonghao!

192
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:05,520
Are you OK?

193
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,560
I am OK.

194
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:13,990
Qianyu.

195
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:14,910
Just take the photos back right away

196
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:15,790
to stop Senwell.

197
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:16,960
Otherwise, it will be too late.

198
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,010
No.

199
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,340
I must find a way to rescue you now.

200
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,420
Leave me here.

201
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:25,960
Qianyu,

202
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,680
listen,

203
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,380
when you face your enemy,

204
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,750
even if you are not confident,

205
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:34,060
never show your timidity.

206
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,870
Believe that you are omnipotent

207
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,720
and suppress him with your strong vigour.

208
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,350
Got it?

209
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:42,790
Qianyu,

210
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,290
Tonghao is right.

211
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,600
You leave first

212
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,810
and I will find a way out here.

213
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,940
All villagers,

214
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,340
the new contract is printed out.

215
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,960
Please take and sign the contract.

216
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,160
All villagers,

217
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,410
I am Xu Ziqian, and I am the representative

218
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:14,100
of Senwell’s chairman.

219
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,520
You may not make your decision now.

220
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,970
I will give your adequate time.

221
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:20,770
You can take the contract

222
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,540
and go back and consider it for a few days.

223
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:27,980
It sounds a good idea.

224
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:35,760
Dear villagers,

225
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:37,980
if you have made a decision,

226
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,150
you can sign the contract right now.

227
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,190
We will very much support you.

228
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,190
Xu Ziqian,

229
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:47,450
I am coming to solve the problem.

230
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,130
Even if you don’t like to help me,

231
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:50,770
don’t be a troublemaker.

232
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,490
Dear all villagers,

233
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,760
I very much understand how Mr. Tang feels now.

234
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,260
But we can’t stop here.

235
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,480
We must look ahead

236
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,800
because the outside world is very beautiful.

237
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:03,500
You can use the money

238
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,940
to do lots of things

239
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:06,740
and live a better life.

240
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,440
Even if you leave,

241
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:10,130
Guanmei Fishing Village will still be here.

242
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,480
Senwell will develop it better.

243
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,650
If you don’t sign the contract,

244
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,850
I will

245
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,260
feel very sorry for you.

246
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,030
But the money is here.

247
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,850
Yes, sign it.

248
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,100
I will sign it.

249
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,010
No.

250
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,680
Don’t sign it. Don’t sign it.

251
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,480
Don’t sign it.

252
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,510
- Give one to me. - Don’t sign it.-

253
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:40,310
Don’t sign it.

254
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,600
- Give one to me. - Don’t sign it.

255
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,120
- Don’t sign it. - Take a second thought.

256
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,000
Why is it necessary to take a second thought?

257
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:47,430
I will sign it too.

258
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,730
Wait a minute.

259
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,230
Don’t sign it.

260
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,000
Do you see it?

261
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,640
This is Chinese white dolphin.

262
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,420
The Chinese white dolphin

263
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,330
that lives in the sea area of Guanmei Island.

264
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,320
It is a first class national endangered species

265
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,120
and honored as aquatic giant panda.

266
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,240
I don’t care if there is any giant panda

267
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,120
or lesser panda.

268
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,010
Don’t delay my work.

269
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,240
When you face your enemy,

270
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:31,370
even if you are not confident,

271
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,680
never show your timidity.

272
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,450
Believe that you are omnipotent

273
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,180
and suppress him with your strong vigour.

274
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:41,210
Mr. Zhang,

275
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,690
as general manager of Senwell,

276
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:43,960
you have no chance to make a mistake.

277
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,210
Shan Junhao?

278
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:51,530
How is it possible?

279
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,130
Don’t you know the term

280
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:55,850
“national forbidden development zone”?

281
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:56,650
OK.

282
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,070
Listen.

283
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,510
According to Article 10 of Chapter 2
of the Law of the PRC

284
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:02,130
on the Protection of Wildlife,

285
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:04,020
the country preferentially protects

286
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,100
precious endangered wild animals.

287
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:07,740
According to Article 22 of Chapter 3 of

288
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,440
the Law of the PRC on
Marine Environmental Protection,

289
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:10,920
a marine natural reserve

290
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,420
shall be established

291
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,940
where there is a natural concentration

292
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,910
of rare and endangered marine organisms.

293
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:18,270
According to Article 7 of Chapter 2 of

294
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,410
the Regulations of the PRC

295
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:21,170
on Protection of Aquatic Wild Animals,

296
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:23,120
no entity and individual is permitted to damage

297
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,720
national and local key protected

298
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,640
water areas for the living and breeding
of aquatic wild animals

299
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,900
and their living conditions.

300
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:32,990
Guanmei Fishing Village is the habitat
of Chinese white dolphins

301
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,710
and commercial development is strictly forbidden.

302
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:36,510
Is it necessary for me to

303
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:38,530
list relevant clauses in details here?

304
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,870
I am afraid the more I list,

305
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:41,250
the greater disadvantage will Senwell face.

306
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:44,120
Do you think these vague photos

307
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,720
can prove presence of white dolphins here?

308
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:46,960
Do you think these legal provisions

309
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,270
can prove your justice?

310
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:49,300
Even if there is any white dolphin,

311
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,050
are you qualified

312
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,720
for endangered species protection zone?

313
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,590
It is so stupid that you rely on them

314
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,020
to stop Senwell from development.

315
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,270
There is a legend about dolphins
at Guanmei Fishing Village

316
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:58,820
but nobody has seen it.

317
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,590
Luckily,

318
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,080
we have found them recently

319
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,380
and they’re in large quantities.

320
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,460
This is the photo I have taken.

321
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,810
I haven’t filed the application.

322
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:07,600
You may choose not to believe what I said

323
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,680
and dismantle the inn compulsorily.

324
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,950
If we acquire the

325
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:11,340
official qualification as a protection zone,

326
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,300
you must unconditionally resume

327
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,740
the original state of what you have

328
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,000
dismantled, including residential building

329
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:18,330
and even a small rock.

330
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,250
What Senwell will lose

331
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:21,360
is not only the resources
you have prepared for long,

332
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,960
but also your reputation in the industry.

333
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:23,760
Higher capability

334
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,400
brings greater responsibilities.

335
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,530
Senwell is obligated

336
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,400
to protect national rare wild animal resources.

337
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,520
Mr. Zhang,

338
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,210
we need to investigate

339
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,510
if there is any Chinese white dolphin.

340
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:40,770
If it is true,

341
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,920
we can’t develop Guanmei Fishing Village

342
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,620
blindly and recklessly.

343
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,210
Even in that case,

344
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,080
the fact of Senwell’s ownership

345
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,570
of Guanmei Hotel won’t be changed.

346
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:51,380
Absolutely.

347
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:54,450
But what can you do with Guanmei Inn?

348
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,230
I suggest you go back and
make investigations clearly.

349
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,890
Or it may just backfire on you.

350
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,310
Great!

351
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,380
Dear villagers,

352
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,700
although you don’t

353
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,940
live a rich life at Guanmei Village,

354
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,360
it is our home.

355
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,090
When our houses are broken,

356
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:13,890
we can construct a new one.

357
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:15,480
When the roads are blocked,

358
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,200
we can repair them.

359
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:18,400
We have hands and feet.

360
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,160
We have the courage and stamina.

361
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:22,520
We should make Guanmei better

362
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,300
instead of rejecting it

363
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,330
and abandoning it.

364
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,750
Yes.

365
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,310
- Good call. - Good.

366
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,620
- Yes. - Good.

367
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,190
- I agree. - She’s right.

368
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,150
Guanmei Fishing Village

369
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,130
is our home.

370
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:42,830
Dear villagers,

371
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,360
I feel deeply sorry

372
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:48,680
for the troubles today.

373
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:50,560
Please believe that Senwell

374
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:53,120
will certainly find a satisfactory

375
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,400
solution for you all.

376
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,320
It is saved.

377
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,860
Great.

378
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:11,740
It won’t be dismantled. I am so happy.

379
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:13,510
We still have our home.

380
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:18,860
Hello,

381
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,490
Taichu?

382
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,670
It was settled here.

383
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:22,480
How are you there?

384
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:24,710
You are in the hospital?

385
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:26,430
I will be there right away.

386
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:38,840
Nurse,

387
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,090
do you know where Tonghao is?

388
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,010
Tonghao?

389
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,670
The one who was just delivered here for rescue?

390
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:44,160
Yes.

391
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,130
He is in the emergency room.

392
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,140
Doctor. Doctor.

393
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,400
Is he Tonghao?

394
00:17:58,770 --> 00:17:59,540
He is…

395
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,280
Tonghao!

396
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:00,980
Tonghao!

397
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,570
Wake up!

398
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,180
Tonghao!

399
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,050
Tonghao!

400
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:04,580
Guanmei Inn is saved!

401
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,950
We are all waiting for your return.

402
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:06,610
Tonghao!

403
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,180
Tonghao!

404
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,500
Doctor!

405
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,370
Please save him!

406
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,170
We are trying to save him.

407
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,520
Tonghao!

408
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,500
Tonghao!

409
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:19,900
Tonghao!

410
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,940
Wake up!

411
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,470
Tonghao!

412
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:22,440
You won’t die.

413
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,240
Tonghao.

414
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,840
Please come back!

415
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,850
I won’t make fun of you again.

416
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,170
I promise.

417
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,190
I won’t push you down the heavenly pit,

418
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,520
nor cause you to fall into water.

419
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:31,890
Tonghao!

420
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,250
Wake up!

421
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,220
Tonghao!

422
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,250
Tonghao!

423
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,770
Tonghao!

424
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:40,680
Qianyu,

425
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,290
what are you doing?

426
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,310
Doctor.

427
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,410
Is my wife here?

428
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,690
No, no, no.

429
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,810
Sorry, sorry!

430
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:52,570
Sorry, doctor!

431
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,570
Sorry.

432
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,930
Sorry, wish you good health.

433
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:55,630
Sorry.

434
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:24,080
Do you hear my heartthrob now?

435
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,560
How can I die?

436
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,420
I know

437
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,930
you won’t die.

438
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:32,820
I still owe you a lot.

439
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,890
I can’t die.

440
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,400
What about your injury?

441
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:37,820
Not serious.

442
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,960
Just some scratches.

443
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,520
Don’t cry again.

444
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:44,760
You really scared me.

445
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,770
They are back.

446
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,790
Get ready!

447
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:00,790
Welcome!

448
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:02,890
Tonghao.

449
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,520
Thank you very much.

450
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,510
You are welcome.

451
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,750
Qianyu, Taichu and I

452
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:09,130
found the dolphins together.

453
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,610
Without them,

454
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:11,960
I wouldn’t have done it by myself.

455
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,070
Cabriolet guy,

456
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,680
thank you!

457
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:18,560
Anyway,

458
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:21,510
we must say thank-you for your driving away

459
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:22,980
Senwell.

460
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,910
You three people are the best.

461
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,680
Please accept our love like this!

462
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,120
Jinzhi,

463
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,120
you also deserve the credit

464
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,160
for your great contributions today.

465
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,340
Me?

466
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,650
I have nothing to do

467
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,580
with Guanmei Inn.

468
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,650
I remember somebody

469
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:47,780
yelled hysterically in the daytime today,

470
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,030
crying “only I am qualified

471
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:53,080
to beat him”.

472
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:54,580
And also the umbrella.

473
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:56,190
When it was opened,

474
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,550
it was full of love.

475
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,670
It hurts.

476
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,090
You don’t have to repeatedly bully me.

477
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,330
Anyway,

478
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,370
many thanks to Tonghao and Taichu

479
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:13,360
for helping to protect Guanmei Inn.

480
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,160
Yes! Yes!

481
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:17,670
Great job!

482
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,030
Thank you!

483
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,480
Well done!

484
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:43,610
Your wound can be treated through an operation.

485
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,990
The success rate is very high.

486
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,590
You can resume your previous life.

487
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:49,970
Resume my previous life?

488
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:50,560
Yes.

489
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:53,040
Don’t you feel curious

490
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,350
about your previous life?

491
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:09,080
What are you thinking about?

492
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:15,150
Nothing.

493
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,670
I was just listening to the sound of waves.

494
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:24,590
Thank you, Tonghao.

495
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:29,870
I should thank you.

496
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:34,020
Thank you

497
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,480
for having accepted a big liar
who has lost his memory.

498
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:42,520
Thank you for not abandoning me.

499
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:49,060
But…

500
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,230
But what?

501
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,520
I think

502
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:03,240
if you get your memories back one day,

503
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,060
maybe you will forget everything here.

504
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,540
Guanmei is possibly just
an accidental stop in your life.

505
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:12,140
All you have done here

506
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,630
will become your past.

507
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:24,120
Do you expect me to get my memories back?

508
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:24,980
I…

509
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,520
I don’t know.

510
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,050
Actually,

511
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,790
it isn’t important if I have my past.

512
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:50,650
What is important is that

513
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:52,260
I have new memories

514
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,450
and I can also understand

515
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,650
your feelings to work hard

516
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:01,160
for what you really care about.

517
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,630
Guanmei is my home

518
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:07,450
and a place that needs my protection.

519
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,960
Don’t worry about the future.

520
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,600
Just let it be.

521
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,150
But how can a person

522
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:18,530
forget his past completely?

523
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,000
Past is passed.

524
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:25,600
What we need is to command the present

525
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,640
and live a good life today.

526
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,200
Sometimes,

527
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,950
I will imagine myself to have lost my memory,

528
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:37,000
just like you,

529
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,280
and been stranded on a small island.

530
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:41,240
I may encounter some people

531
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:42,800
and some things.

532
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:45,040
I am like a piece of white paper

533
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,720
that can be filled with many things,

534
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,740
but may feel lonely sometimes.

535
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:57,080
Although I have lost my memory,

536
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,250
I feel so lighthearted

537
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,140
and can clearly feel

538
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,240
the fresh winds

539
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,680
and enjoy the sunshine

540
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,560
here at Guanmei.

541
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,970
Doesn’t it feel good to live this way?

542
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:33,800
Investigations show that

543
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,970
there are white dolphins
at Guanmei Fishing Village.

544
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,430
Once it is classified as
an endangered animal protection zone,

545
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,460
a greater part of the development project

546
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,190
will be infeasible.

547
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:47,970
The Development Department is calculating

548
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:50,610
the costs of revision and
the profit margin of the project.

549
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,110
If it is worthwhile,

550
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,340
the project of Guanmei Fishing Village

551
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:56,840
will continue.

552
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:03,360
Even if the project is suspended,

553
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,860
Senwell still retains ownership of Guanmei Inn.

554
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:08,920
Without Tang Shunming,

555
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:11,410
there wouldn’t have been so many troubles.

556
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:13,900
You should feel lucky

557
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,470
that you didn’t dismantle Guanmei Inn yesterday.

558
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,840
If the white dolphins were identified
after commencement of the project,

559
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,520
it would be a serious negligence
in our survey work.

560
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,720
Negligence in our survey?

561
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,090
Negligence in our survey?

562
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,200
It is all because of

563
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,880
you and Shan Junhao.

564
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,470
You don’t know

565
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:39,770
where Shan Junhao is, right?

566
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,680
Because Shan Junhao

567
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,890
has no reason to disappear

568
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:50,170
and give up Senwell for so long.

569
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:00,910
He is lost.

570
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:03,800
What?

571
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,260
Zhang Minghan.

572
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,440
Listen,

573
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:10,330
Shan Junhao is really lost.

574
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:13,250
He disappeared without any sign

575
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:14,810
at our engagement ceremony.

576
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,170
He didn’t attend the chairman’s funeral.

577
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,520
For the general good of the group,

578
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:23,120
we have concealed the fact.

579
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,020
Mr. Zhang,

580
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,120
if it is known to the public that
Shan Junhao has been lost,

581
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:28,880
what will be the consequences?

582
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,090
Yunyi.

583
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,080
Yunyi!

584
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:37,960
Yunyi!

585
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:55,600
Yunyi.

586
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:57,160
Are you OK?

587
00:27:58,590 --> 00:27:59,480
Will Zhang Minghan

588
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,010
disclose Junhao’s disappearance

589
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,330
to the public?

590
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,890
He has always very much cared about

591
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:06,060
the reputation of Senwell.

592
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:08,470
He is the general manager now.

593
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,450
I don’t think he will.

594
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:17,030
Ziqian,

595
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:19,490
Junhao won’t come back, right?

596
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,680
I can’t hold on sometimes.

597
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,440
Will it feel better to accept the reality?

598
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,320
You know,

599
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,970
I always recall my childhood.

600
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,130
When I was ten years old,

601
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,710
Uncle Shan sent us to a wild training camp

602
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,940
to train our perseverance.

603
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,380
Only Junhao

604
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,040
didn’t press the help alarm button.

605
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:46,560
He has been strong and confident

606
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:47,810
since childhood

607
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,790
and he never gives up.

608
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,000
That is his personality today.

609
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:54,010
Maybe he has encountered many difficulties

610
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,220
and can’t contact us now.

611
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:57,840
But he must be pushing hard along

612
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:00,980
and try to come back to us.

613
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,120
Before Junhao gives up,

614
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:07,360
we must hold on.

615
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,180
= Customer Experiences =

616
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,620
Although the crisis of Guanmei Inn

617
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,800
is relieved for now,

618
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:39,960
Senwell won’t give up.

619
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,760
Let’s make the hotel better

620
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:44,840
during this period.

621
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:46,750
When the tourists arrive at the hotel,

622
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,590
they expect for greater convenience,

623
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,580
higher-than-expected services,

624
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,050
freedom,

625
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,590
and good service experiences.

626
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,780
What we can do

627
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,250
is to satisfy all their requirements

628
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:58,920
beyond their expectations

629
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,330
so that they will

630
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:04,930
come to this hotel next time.

631
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,630
Do you understand

632
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:08,980
such a feeling?

633
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,300
- Yes. - Yes.

634
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,350
Check your notes.

635
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:16,610
Sheng, you have got

636
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:17,960
the wrong character of Guanmei Inn.

637
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:20,870
I see.

638
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,360
It should be a different character.

639
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:26,930
Master,

640
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,030
what shall I add now?

641
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,060
Mushrooms.

642
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:40,010
Master.

643
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:40,790
And now?

644
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:41,760
Potato.

645
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,580
OK.

646
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:51,730
How do you think about it?

647
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:59,380
I asked you to add potato chips

648
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,480
instead of potato blocks.

649
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:03,840
I think they have similar shapes.

650
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,130
How about now?

651
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,570
Add some onions

652
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,270
to improve the taste.

653
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:09,980
OK.

654
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,510
Qianyu.

655
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:26,680
What’s up?

656
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,720
I cut my hand.

657
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:30,780
Are you OK?

658
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:34,650
Qianyu.

659
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,340
You…

660
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:38,170
Why did you have to come here for cooking?

661
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,600
You just

662
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,050
made a big mess here.

663
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,810
Tonghao was injured

664
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:46,060
so I have to consult you

665
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,300
which soup can help to heal the wound.

666
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:49,240
Well,

667
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:51,360
I can cook for him.

668
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,110
No.

669
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:53,010
I must make it myself.

670
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,080
Do you have band-aid?

671
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,630
OK.

672
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:00,580
Wait a minute.

673
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,240
Tonghao,

674
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:07,970
drink my soup!

675
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,230
I made it personally!

676
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,260
What’s wrong with your hand?

677
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,150
I accidentally cut my finger
when I was cutting an onion just now.

678
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:19,880
So

679
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,920
you must drink all the soup.

680
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,140
I consulted Master

681
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,910
and cooked this nutritious soup for you.

682
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:27,680
Take care next time.

683
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:38,870
How do you think about it?

684
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:39,800
Do you like it?

685
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:46,770
Very delicious.

686
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:47,520
Really?

687
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,130
Let me have a taste.

688
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,540
I want to drink one more bowl.

689
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:16,870
One more bowl?

690
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:17,990
Master is here too.

691
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,250
Drink it if you like.

692
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,280
Anyway,

693
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,520
I was preparing to throw it away just now.

694
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,200
Thanks, Master.

695
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,870
Is it really delicious?

696
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:34,230
Yes.

697
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,350
Are you sure?

698
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,660
Because it was made by you.

699
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,650
Qianyu,

700
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:43,530
Guanmei Inn urgently needs publicity now.

701
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:45,570
But we have a limited budget.

702
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,070
I hope to organize a photography show.

703
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:47,970
A photography show?

704
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,400
Yes, a photography show.

705
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:51,220
Qianyu,

706
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,760
I have submitted the application

707
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:55,730
for white dolphin protection zone.

708
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,280
They will reply to us soon.

709
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:58,530
Thanks, Taichu.

710
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,690
I have also figured out a good way

711
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:01,960
to publicize Guanmei Inn.

712
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,270
Photography show.

713
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,700
You share the same idea as Tonghao.

714
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:12,080
Really?

715
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,460
The photography show

716
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,710
will publicize not only Guanmei Inn,

717
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,200
but also the culture of Guanmei Fishing Village.

718
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,610
This is the best publicity method

719
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,960
that I can figure out

720
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,320
within our ability.

721
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:26,440
It can work effectively

722
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:28,280
through online and offline means.

723
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:30,560
We have taken many photos

724
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,940
of Guanmei Fishing Village

725
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,530
and they are enough for a photography show.

726
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,630
You have taken the photos of Guanmei today

727
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,490
but you don’t have the photos of its past.

728
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,460
I have an idea.

729
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,690
Our inn has many old black and white photos.

730
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:45,920
Just take them out and repair them.

731
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,650
OK, I will start making preparations right away.

732
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,840
We can also invite

733
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:56,320
some media professionals
who love traveling and photographing.

734
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:57,810
Moreover,

735
00:34:57,830 --> 00:34:58,730
our guests

736
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:00,940
can also be our spectators.

737
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,420
Instead of casting a net blindly,

738
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:05,550
I recommend directly inviting
an authoritative traveler here.

739
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,330
An authoritative traveler

740
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:09,580
will spread the fame of Guanmei
Fishing Village and Guanmei Inn

741
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,970
to numerous people.

742
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:12,790
No.

743
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:15,940
Guanmei Fishing Village is an unknown place

744
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:18,040
and Guanmei Inn has just recovered
from its long-term depression.

745
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,040
Those famous guys

746
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:21,720
won’t come at our invitation.

747
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:24,620
We should invite some more reliable people

748
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,960
according to the ability and level of our inn.

749
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:27,990
You must have a try

750
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:28,780
to know the result.

751
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,440
This is a list I have drafted.

752
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,250
Qianyu,

753
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,060
I have also drafted a list.

754
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,600
Only one person?

755
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,270
This person

756
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:47,870
works more effectively than
hundreds of media professionals.

757
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:00,920
My decision is

758
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,540
inviting the guests on both lists.

759
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,990
Just one person more anyway.

760
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:06,290
I won’t give up

761
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:07,350
if there is a chance.

762
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:25,970
Excuse me,

763
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:26,930
I have to answer a phone call.

764
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,680
I will go and sort out the photos.

765
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:45,740
Mr. Zhang,

766
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,490
why did you call us here in such a hurry?

767
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:49,850
What’s up?

768
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,410
Mr. Wang of GQ Ventures will return
to China in a few days.

769
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:55,320
He wants to meet Shan Junhao.

770
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,780
You are the general manager now.

771
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,350
You can fully represent Senwell to talk to him.

772
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:05,720
It is Shan Junhao who has

773
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,260
discussed on all projects between Senwell and GQ.

774
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,400
Mr. Wang only talks to Shan Junhao.

775
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,030
If he can’t return this time,

776
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:13,760
the project will stop.

777
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:15,460
They already started to have suspicions

778
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:17,180
due to the problem of white dolphins.

779
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,240
If Mr. Wang withdraws investments,

780
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,280
the impacts on Senwell will be enormous.

781
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,270
The development of Guanmei Fishing Village

782
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:26,450
will certainly stop.

783
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:29,890
I can talk to him.

784
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:32,010
GQ Ventures’s funds

785
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:33,320
will go to the project in the end.

786
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:35,070
It is a profit-oriented investment.

787
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,860
I don’t think he will be so stubborn.

788
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:42,950
You talked about the disappearance
of Shan Junhao to me before.

789
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,150
What happened on earth?

790
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:47,860
For the benefit of Senwell,

791
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:50,040
I have the right to know all facts.

792
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,910
You are the general manager now

793
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,440
and we don’t have to hide it from you.

794
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:01,280
I believe you know how to handle it

795
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,100
for the benefit of Senwell.

796
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:04,040
So

797
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,030
where on earth is Shan Junhao?

798
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,840
He had a car accident.

799
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:19,660
On the day of engagement ceremony,

800
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:22,800
he had a traffic accident

801
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:24,660
on the way taking his ring.

802
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:45,470
Aunt Jiang,

803
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,470
please restrain your grief’.

804
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,280
Life is uncertain.

805
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,130
Just let it be.

806
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:58,850
I only hope Ziqian,

807
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,730
Yunyi and you

808
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,230
can manage Senwell properly together.

809
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:07,020
This is the expectation of Yaolong and Junhao.

810
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:19,050
I have to leave first.

811
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,550
I didn’t expect Shan Junhao
had a traffic accident.

812
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,480
It was a long time ago.

813
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,860
I don’t think he will come back.

814
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,000
It is good news actually.

815
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:56,430
Well…

816
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:10,960
Where is Qianyu?

817
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,700
She is delivering goods.

818
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,260
Delivering goods?

819
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,850
It is my job.

820
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:19,170
She said your wound hadn’t recovered

821
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,520
and you were already too busy
at the inn in the daytime

822
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:22,840
and you needed more rests.

823
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,890
Tonghao,

824
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:34,450
since you came to Guanmei,

825
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:37,270
you have helped Money Bag Grocery
and the inn a lot.

826
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,640
I really appreciate your efforts.

827
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,760
You are a good boy.

828
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:45,680
It is what I should do.

829
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:48,510
You accepted me anyway.

830
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:51,980
Moreover, you are all very good to me,

831
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,600
particularly Qianyu

832
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:54,740
and you,

833
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:55,990
and also Shengzhe.

834
00:41:57,790 --> 00:41:59,660
Don’t misunderstand her.

835
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:03,270
Words like this are normally followed by

836
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:04,980
“but”.

837
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,170
But

838
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:14,220
have you ever thought of

839
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,790
going back to your original life

840
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:19,810
when you get your memories back one day?

841
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:29,090
Maybe you already have a girlfriend

842
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:32,790
or you are married.

843
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:34,440
What

844
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:37,190
shall Qianyu do then?

845
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:40,920
But

846
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:44,340
I only have the present in my memory.

847
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:49,640
Tonghao,

848
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,100
you have forgotten your past.

849
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,940
But those who had lived with you

850
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,260
haven’t forgotten it.

851
00:42:56,670 --> 00:43:00,100
You still have relations with them.

852
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:04,830
Do you know

853
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,120
why I talked to you about it?

854
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:23,560
Tonghao,

855
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:24,950
you still have a long way to go

856
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,500
