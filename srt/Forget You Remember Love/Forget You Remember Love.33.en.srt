Check the water heater immediately.

14

Yes.

all true?

29
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,910
I was your father’s assistant.

30
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,190
I’m the only one

31
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,830
who knows the truth.

32
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,800
Why did you confess now?

33
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,800
I’ve been living

34
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,880
with a guilty conscience

35
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,670
for over 20 years.

36
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,360
I’ve had enough.

37
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,830
I can’t take it anymore.

38
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,800
You were with my husband for decades.

39
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,440
You know him the best.

40
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,860
Why did he do that?

41
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,630
Investment in Dongdao Finance

would hold Senwell back

45
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,440
or even destroy it,

46
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,360
so he did that.

47
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,520
He

48
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,320
loved Senwell

49
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,240
more than anything.

No!

Let us in.

Sorry, you can’t enter the building.

58
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,040
We need to interview Mr. Shan.

59
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,760
Please go back. Mr. Shan isn’t here.

60
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,210
- Let us in.
- Is Mr. Shan in or not?

61
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,670
Mr. Shan won’t take any interviews, sorry.

62
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,640
Why are there so many reporters?

63
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,880
Let’s go straight to the garage.

64
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,580
- Yes. - We only have a few questions.

65
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,900
- Mr. Shan. - Let us in.

66
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,810
- Mr. Shan is here. - Mr. Shan.

67

Mr. Shan. Mr. Shan.

68
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,650
Say something, Mr. Shan!

69
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,270
- Mr. Shan. - Mr. Shan.

70
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,550
Let us in.

71
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,350
I’m sorry, you can’t.

72

I can’t let you in

74

until I’m ordered otherwise.

75
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,280
Please go back.

76
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,390
What are you doing here?

77
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,790
I was looking for you everywhere.

78
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,150
I’m waiting for Shan Junhao.

79
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:37,950
You promised you’d only target at Shan Junhao,

80
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:38,720
not Senwell.

81
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,790
You didn’t discuss anything with me

82
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:40,550
before taking any action.

83
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:41,600
And you fed such a huge scandal

84
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,700
to the press.

85
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,390
Do you know how bad

86
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,160
the impact is?

87
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,480
The stock price has plunged to the limit.

88
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,600
Many partners are officially

89
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,440
terminating the cooperation. You know?

90
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,270
Mr. Zhang,

91
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,790
I’ve never promised you anything.

92
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,440
We’ve agreed to join hands.

93
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,600
I also told you

94
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,790
I never take sides.

95
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,270
I’m only doing things my way.

96
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,350
What are you up to?

97
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,640
I feel sorry for Director Xu.

98
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,510
He always regards Mr. Shan as his brother.

99
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,270
I know.

100
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,930
What will Mr. Shan do?

101
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,320
How will Mr. Shan...

102
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,160
- Morning, Mr. Shan. - Mr. Shan.

103
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,300
Mr. Taichu,

104
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:04,950
welcome back to Senwell.

105
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,070
I’m only back

106
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:10,270
to finish the Guanmei Project.

107
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,070
I admire your generosity.

108
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,670
Your calmness is admirable, too.

109
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,000
In the adult world,

110
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,480
there are always ups and downs,

111
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:32,880
but not in their emotions.

112
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,920
Senwell’s stock price

113
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,760
has hit the limit down.

114
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,510
Hope it won’t break you.

115
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:38,750
Thanks for your concern.

116
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:42,480
My only concern is your personal affair

117
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,480
may hinder the project.

118
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,160
If you can’t handle it properly,

119
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,070
GQ may still withdraw the funds

120
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,320
due to

121
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,440
Senwell’s breach of contract.

122
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,110
Rest assured.

123
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,160
I’ll give you a proper explanation.

124
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:21,670
Ziqian?

125
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,660
You must’ve known it by now.

126
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:37,540
That’s unimportant.

127
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,020
What matters is

128
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,980
to right the wrong.

129
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,150
If my dad did make such mistakes,

130
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,940
I will take full responsibility.

131
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,500
No wonder all these years,

132
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,010
your parents took excellent care of me.

133
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,720
I was grateful for it

134
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,550
and really appreciated it.

135
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:34,310
I regarded you all as my real family,

136
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,540
but now I realize

137
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,840
everything is a lie.

138
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,760
They loved you with their hearts.

139
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:02,350
Hearts?

140
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,990
Do you believe that yourself?

141
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,590
Does any of you still have a heart?

142
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,470
Our dads

143
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,790
were best partners and friends.

144
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,080
But

145
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,440
after your dad stole everything,

146
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,520
he murdered my dad heartlessly.

147
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:36,790
And you...

148
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,030
Yunyi is your fiancée.

149
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,200
You’re her world.

150
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:49,300
Yet you hurt and abandoned her repeatedly.

151
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,340
Shan Junhao,

152
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,500

Yunyi

154
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,420
and me

155
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,780
must be paid back altogether!

156
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,320
I’m sorry, Ziqian.

157
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,960
I’ll do anything

158
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,080
to make it up to you.

159
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:28,470
I know I can’t ask you to forgive me,

160
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:31,320
but

161
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,880
I still want you to know

162
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:39,700
you’ve always been my best friend.

163
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,280
Drop your act.

164
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,180
Get out!

165
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,340
I don’t want to see you again!

166
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:13,800
Ziqian.

167
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,300

Shan Junhao,

172
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,320
why didn’t you answer my calls?

173
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,000
You know how worried I am?

174
00:12:59,110 --> 00:12:59,780
Qianyu.

175
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,520
I want to see you.

176
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,210
Good!

177
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,500
Thank you. Thanks.

- Bravo! - Thanks.

See?

180
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,200
A pretty face can conquer the world.

181
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,910
I couldn’t make so much money on my own.

182
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,710
I’m surprised that you’d be so happy

183
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,040
over such little things.

184
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,670
Put all little things

185

together,

186
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,670
your happiness will grow bigger.

187
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:32,400
I’ll come here with you every day.

188
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,320
You aren’t going back?

189
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:37,150
Maybe your family is looking for you

190
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,000
and waiting for you.

191
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,660
I don’t know if I can face them.

00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,620
You can escape for a while

193
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,540
but not forever.

194
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,900
When I was with you,

195
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,640
I could put the past behind for a while.

196
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,100
It was a nightmare.

197
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,900
I don’t want to relive it.

198
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,400
Alright then.

199
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,910
Once you’re ready to move on,

200
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,670
you can go back then.

201
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:14,200
Let’s continue to sing, OK?

202
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:21,340
= Guanmei Inn =

203
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:54,200
Do you remember

204
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,550
the story you told me

205
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,880
when we were trapped in the heavenly pit?

206
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:02,790
You said a frog was looking for water

207
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:05,200
but only found a rock.

208
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,960
Eventually, it died out of thirst.

209
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,150
But it didn’t know

210
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:09,790
right under the rock

211
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,760
there was a spring.

212
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,590
The water gushed out continually.

213
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,790
Whenever I was in trouble,

214
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,000
I’d think of that story.

215
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:21,550
So,

216
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:23,760
no matter what happens,

217
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,670
don’t give up,

218
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,030
OK?

219
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,400
If one day,

220
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,960
I lost everything,

221
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,790
would you still love me?

222
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:51,030
Why did you ask me that?

223
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,400
I’m a bit unconfident.

224
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,640
I fear

225
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,110
I’d lose you

226
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,710
if I became penniless.

227
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:05,910
You fool!

228
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,110
When I fell in love with Tonghao,

229
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,760
he wasn’t just penniless.

230
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,470
He even owed me 8,500 yuan.

231
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,640
Don’t frown.

232
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,710
That’s better.

233
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:36,000
Smile more.

234
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,400
Life is hard

235
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,030
but don’t forget to be happy,

236
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,230
OK?

237
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,000
Thank you, Qianyu.

238
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,230
Listen,

239
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,880
whatever the future holds,

240
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,000
I’m always there for you.

241
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:01,400
Really?

242
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,160
Yes.

243
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,640
These shares

244
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,110
used to belong to your dad.

245
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:42,880
Now, I’m returning them to you.

246
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,710
Also,

247
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:48,350
those that my mother and I own

248
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,520
are yours for free

249
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,820
as compensation to your family.

250
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,830
Will those

251
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:05,280
bring two lives back?

252
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,160
I know

253
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,160
whatever we do

254
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,000
can’t make up

255
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,560
for all your losses.

256
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,800
We’re simply trying

257
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,190
to atone for Yaolong’s sins.

258
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:39,710
Ziqian.

259
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,710
All these years,

260
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,760
I’ve been treating you as my own son.

261
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:49,590
Please,

262
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,710
you have to trust me on that.

263
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:02,880
Whatever you offer me

264
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,300
won’t make me forgive you.

265
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,110
I’m not asking for your forgiveness.

266
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,860
All I hope is that you can

267
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,820
keep our fathers’ legacy and carry it forward.

268
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:24,950
Meanwhile,

269
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,710
I have a small request.

270
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,110
I hope the Guanmei Project

271
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,230
can be continued.

272
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:36,040
The village will become a wonderful resort.

273
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,000
At this stage,

274
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,920
you’re still thinking for Ye Qianyu?

275
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,460
Have you forgot

276
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,160
Yunyi is still missing?

277
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,710
I’ll continue

278
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,760
looking for her.

279
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,190
This…

280
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,640
Isn’t over.

281

= Equity Transfer Agreement =

282
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,950
You gave everything to Xu Ziqian?

283
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,040
He deserves it.

284
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,760
Taking a step back might not be the best solution.

285
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:38,460
But it can make me feel less guilty.

286
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:46,590
Mr. Shan.

287
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,880
Director Xu’s lawyer

288
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,310
sent you the complaint.

289
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,470
He demands to reopen the case

290
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,850
and follow through.

291
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:59,460
= Lawyer’s Letter =

292
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,000
If my dad

293
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,680
was indeed guilty,

294
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:13,190
I’ll take full responsibility.

295
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,070
Besides,

296
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,560
Director Xu told the press

297
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,800
that you returned the shares.

298
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:19,560
The news is out.

299
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,880
We have to get out of here.

300
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,430
Otherwise,

301
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,640
we’ll be surrounded by reporters again.

302
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:30,190
Mr. Taichu,

303
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,190
see you around.

304
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,950
Look forward to working with you again.

305
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,360
Mr. Shan.

306
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,710
Shan Junhao.

307
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,760
It serves you right.

308
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,950
None of your business.

309
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:09,000
I don’t get it.

310
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,230
What makes you still so confident?

311
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,560
Don’t forget

312
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,190
Xu Ziqian lost his family because of you.

313
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,800
You’ve got what you deserve

314
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:19,710
today.

315
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:22,640
What we owe to Ziqian

316
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,800
is not your concern.

317
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,590
Former GM of Senwell

318
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,470
fell from his pedestal

319
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:33,920
and lost everything.

320
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,040
Poor man!

321
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,210
- Mr. Shan is here. - Mr. Shan.

322
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:48,730
- Mr. Shan. Mr. Shan. - Mr. Shan.

323
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,140
Is it true

324
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:50,900
that you gave up all your shares?

325
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,180
After returning the shares,

326
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,140
what’s your plan next?

327
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,460
Mr. Shan, by doing that,

328
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,860
are you admitting that your father was guilty?

329
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:56,860
It’s said Xu Ziqian

330
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,430
will pursue his parents’ case to the end.

331
00:22:58,430 --> 00:22:59,140
How will you deal with that?

332
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,080
Are you admitting to the accusations?

333
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,100
Mr. Shan,

334
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,050
- did Xu Ziqian force you to do that? - Let’s go.

335
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:03,160
- Did you do it willingly?
- Excuse me. Sorry.

336
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,330
Or you are caved to the public opinion?

337
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:06,300
Mr. Shan, say something.

338
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:07,820
Excuse me.

339
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:08,960
- Mr. Shan. - Mr. Shan.

340
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:19,160
Who... Who are you?

341
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,800
We’re sent by the city court.

00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,640
I am.

Hold on.

How did this happen?

He’s lost his company and all his money.

He’s broke!

374
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,310
Is it true that his dad was responsible

375
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:47,070
for the explosion?

Oh, no.

384
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:07,620
I gotta call Qianyu.

385
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,520
Sheng.

386
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,590
Qianyu,

387
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:19,800
bad news!

388
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,430
Shan Junhao lost his company.

389
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:22,230
What?

390
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,110

Thanks.

394
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,950
How did this happen?

395
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:39,520
What’s wrong?

396
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,310
What happened?

397
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,020
We’ve logged everything.

398
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:58,560
Is there anything left?

399
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:00,300
Mom.

What’s going on?

00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:09,830
Look.

403
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,000
What should we do?

Officer,

406
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:28,950
must we move out today?

407
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:29,830
According to the law,

408
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:31,230
the seizure enters into force immediately.

409
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,800
You can only take daily necessities.

410
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:35,160
Please pack up.

411
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,420

Let’s go pack up.

I need to see him now.

416
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,280
Do you know where he is?

417
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:29,580
I’m sorry, Dawei.

418
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:31,700
You also lost your job

419
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,540
because of me.

420
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:37,430
It’s OK, Mr. Shan.

421
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,680
Don’t worry about me.

422
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:42,160
I’ll continue looking for Yunyi.

423
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,430
If there’s anything new,

424
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,810
I’ll let you know.

425
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:53,920
Mom.

426
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:09,460
Mrs. Lin,

427
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:12,230
this is your salary

428
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:13,860
and compensation.

429
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,800
Thank you for helping us all these years.

430
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,170
You’re too kind, Mr. Shan.

431
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,840
I can’t take this.

432
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,820
Don’t worry about me.

433
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,180
I can go live with my daughter.

434
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:26,780
But now,

435
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:29,000
under this circumstance,

436
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,230
I’m afraid

437
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:31,920
it’s hard for Mrs. Shan

438
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,950
to adjust to the change.

439
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:36,880
Please keep the money

440
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,760
and take good care of your mother.

441
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:47,560
Listen to me,

442
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,760
just take it.

443
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,760
Thank you, Mrs. Shan.

444
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:56,280
Do take care of yourself.

445
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:58,880
So do you.

446
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:05,400
Let’s go.

- Mr. Shan. - Mr. Shan.

451
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,740
Excuse me.

Sorry. Excuse me.

453
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,430
Step aside, everyone.

454
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:51,010
Excuse me.

455
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,310
Enough.

456
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:53,880
- Excuse me. - Make a way.

457
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,520
What’s your response?

458
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,510
- Say something, Mr. Shan. - No more photos.

459
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:57,700
Excuse me. Thank you.

460
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:59,140
- Is this because... - Excuse me.

461
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,330
Please step back.

462
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,130
Answer the question, Mr. Shan.

463

- Mrs. Shan. - Mrs. Shan.

464
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:04,920
What do you have to say?

465

- Mrs. Shan. Mr. Shan. - Mr. Shan.

466
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:07,580
Alright. That’s enough. No more photos.

467
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:09,190
Thank you, everyone. Stop taking photos.

468
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:11,250
Thank you. Please stop.

469
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,530
- Did Mr. Xu set you up? - What’s the truth?

470
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:13,340
Alright. Enough.

471
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,020
- Did anyone pressure you?
- Enough, everyone.

472
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:14,860
Mr. Shan.

473
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,260
Thank you. Excuse me. Make a way.

474
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,580
Does your silence mean yes, Mr. Shan?

475
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:18,710
- Mr. Shan. - Mr. Shan.

476
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:20,100
- Mrs. Shan. Mrs. Shan. - Mrs. Shan.

477
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,220
Mr. Shan, does your silence mean

478
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:21,800
it’s all true?

479
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,070
Mrs. Shan, say something.

480
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,440
Answer the question, Mr. Shan.

481
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,560
Is this a yes, Mr. Shan?

482
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:51,880
Mom.

483
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,950
It’s OK.

484
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:55,760
I’m here.

485
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,080
Everything will be fine.

486
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,590
Dawei!

487
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:23,680
Qianyu?

488
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,000
Where’s Shan Junhao?

489
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,590
He left with Mrs. Shan.

490
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:31,430
Where did they go?

491
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,800
Hotel.

492
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,160
They...

493
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,050
Have nowhere else to live.

494
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:40,040
Do you know the address?

495
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:40,950
Text it to me.

496
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:41,880
Thank you.

497
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:42,880
Sure.

498
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,040
Let me.

499
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:21,240
I’m sorry, sir.

500
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:22,390
Your card got rejected.

501
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:23,190
It can’t be used.

502
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,550
Try this one.

503
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:32,260
OK.

504
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,080
Sorry, sir.

505
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,400
It can’t be used, either.

506
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:55,680
Fine. Thanks.

507
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,470
Can we go to the rooms?

508
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:11,110
They’re all booked.

509
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:20,640
Let’s go to another hotel.

510
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:51,580
Let’s go, Mom.

511
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,040
Give one suitcase to me.

512
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:58,310
I can do it.

513
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:19,760
Hello,

514
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:25,600
did you see the man in this photo?

515
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,870
He’s with a woman.

516
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:29,800
Their cards got rejected, so they left.

517
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,870
Did they say anything before leaving?

518
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:33,840
No.

519
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:42,080
Thank you.

520
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,230
You’re welcome.

521
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:13,280
Mr. Xu.

522
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,800
Any news?

523
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:19,630
The police haven’t found anyone

524
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:21,320
matching the description of Director Fan.

525
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,710
She didn’t go back to the Shans’?

526
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:23,430
No.

527
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:24,760
We have men

528
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,620
monitoring that place 24/7.

529
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,500
Had she gone back,

530
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,710
we would’ve been notified at once.

531
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,360
Keep looking.

532
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,120
Yes.

533
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,870
Hello.

534
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:03,220
OK.

535
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:06,000
Come to my office.

536
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,600
Director Xu.

537
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,560
Please.

538
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:33,840
Hello, Director Xu.

539
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:34,720
No.

540
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:36,950
Mr. Xu.

541
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:38,910
Long time no see.

542
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,040
I know

543
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,630
you found Ding Yuanxun.

544
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,670
Without him,

545
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,520
I wouldn’t have discovered the truth.

546
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:50,600
You will

547
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:52,080
be rewarded for that.

548
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,190
Mr. Xu,

549
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:55,320
that’s too kind of you.

550
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:56,870
Actually, we’ve got

551
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,080
what we want.

552
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,190
That is to see Shan Junhao

553
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,600
lose everything.

554
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,120
I can’t be happier

555
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,150
seeing him fall so hard.

556
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,000
Yes.

557
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:09,950
Mr. Xu,

558
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,560
we’re here today

559
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,020
not to ask for any reward

560
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,120
but to introduce someone

561
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,570
to you.

562
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,390
Who is it?

563
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:39,040
Junhao,

564
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,340
I’m sorry

565
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,190
that you have to

566
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:48,280
pay the debts we owed.

567
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:51,040
Don’t say that, Mom.

568
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,710
Give me some time.

569
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:56,950
Everything will be fine.

570
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,870
I’ll go get some drinks.

571
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:04,230
Wait here for me, OK?

572
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:18,320
Hello, two bottles of water, please.

573
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,410
OK.

574
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,630
That’s ten yuan.

575
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,360
Sorry, I...

576
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,950
I don’t want them now.

577
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:39,710
I’ll pay.

578
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,630
Thanks.

579
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,320
Shan Junhao!

580
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,050
I love chocolate.

581
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:55,630
Shan Junhao!

582
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,320
Shan Junhao!

583
00:38:58,470 --> 00:38:59,710
Shan Junhao!

584
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,840
Shan... Shan...

585
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,390
Shan Junhao! Stop!

586
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,320
Do you know

587
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:10,320
I have been looking for you the all day?

588
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,630
I went to your house, the hotel

589
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:13,040
and finally found you here!

590
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,950
I’m so worried!

591
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:29,470
I can handle

592
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:30,670
my own business!

593
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:37,360
What are you doing?

594
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,040
Shan Junhao,

595
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,840
you idiot!

596
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,230
Since we’ve decided to be together,

597
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:44,870
then your problem is also mine!

598
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:46,280
Why are you avoiding me?

599
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,630
Are you crazy?

600
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:48,870
Don’t you know you could get hit?

601
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:49,950
I don’t!

602
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:51,390
I don’t know anything.

603
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:53,190
All I know is I’m so worried

604
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,950
that I’m losing my mind.

605
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:57,590
Why didn’t you answer my calls?

606
00:39:57,790 --> 00:39:58,960
After all that happened,

607
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,080
I could only read it on the news.

608
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:03,520
I don’t want to drag you into this.

609
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:04,730
Shan Junhao,

610
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:06,940
what’s that supposed to mean?

611
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,380
You don’t love me at all!

612
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,760
You have no idea how much I care

613
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,000
and worry about you!

614
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,740
They’re two separate things.

615
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:17,680
Shan Junhao is invincible.

616
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:18,840
He shouldn’t let others worry

617
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,120
or pity him!

618
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,710
He isn’t the man you’re looking at now.

619
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,760
You don’t know what he looked like

620
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,670
when I met him at his lowest point.

621
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:30,120
Back then,

622
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,040
you wore cheap clothes

623
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:34,540
and delivered goods

624
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,190
and food with me every day.

625
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:38,940
Even so,

626
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:40,900
you were still optimistic.

627
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,470
You cared what I cared.

628
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,520
My concern was your concern.

629
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,140
But now,

630
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,040
you choose to escape.

631
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:51,600
You said

632
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,560
you’d never let me leave.

633
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:54,630
But now,

634
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:55,870
you’re leaving me!

635
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:00,750
I’m sorry, Qianyu.

636
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:03,610
I never meant to do that.

637
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:05,390
You told me

638
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,320
there’s an angle

639
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,130
in Ye Qianyu’s heart.

640
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:13,190
But she knows it better than anyone

641
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:16,160
that in Shan Junhao’s heart,

642
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,140
there’s an angle, too,

643
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:22,200
whose name is Tonghao.

644
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:28,190
Ye Qianyu,

645
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,000
if you’re trying to move me

646
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,520
with your words,

647
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,990
then you’ve made it.

648
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:18,840
Go home with me.

649
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:22,080
You once said

650
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:24,390
Guanmei is your home.

651
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:30,530
