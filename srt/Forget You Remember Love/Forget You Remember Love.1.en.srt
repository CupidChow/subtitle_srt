Once upon a time,

12
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:50,580
there were three greedy pirates,

13
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:56,280
the greedy devil, Ye Shengzhe,

14
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,930
the stingy queen, Chen Jinzhi,

15
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,010
and the untruthful captain, Ye Qianyu.

16
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,900
They went through all kind of hardships

17
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:09,220
and found the legendary treasure.

18
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,700
I’m the guardian of the chest.

19
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,780
I know why you’re here.

20
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,310
Give me a kiss,

21
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,350
and I’ll give the treasures to you.

22
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:38,250
Have you seen enough?

23
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:41,400
Are you willing to kiss me?

24
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,440
Of course, I am.

25
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,630
Here I come.

26
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,640
Who would kiss you, stinky frog?

27
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,910
The treasures are ours!

28
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,020
You kick me?

29
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,830
Now,

30
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,110
I’m going to turn you all into frogs!

31

Qianyu,

32
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,660

33
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,390
Oh, by the way,

34
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,280
in fact,

35
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,130
I’m a prince being cursed.

36
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,060
If you kiss me,

37
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,000
I’ll transform to what I used to be.

38
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:29,960
And,

39
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,820
you can take the treasures away.

40
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:34,880
Kiss me.

41
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,220

48
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,630
Mom.

49
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,780
You hid 500 yuan

50
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,900
in the frog’s pocket?

51
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,730
That’s mine.

52
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,740
Come clean.

You’d better be right.

58

What did you do to me?

159
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,680
I performed CPR on you.

160
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:06,940
Without me,

161
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,030
you’d be dead now.

162
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,390
What’s the smell?

163
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,120
What?

164
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,770
Is it the Tonghao I ate in the morning?

165
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,590
Tonghao?

166
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,220
What does that mean?

167
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:32,230
I…

168
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,030
I saved you!

169
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,940
Shouldn’t you be grateful?

Thank you.

To save you,

174
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:49,710
I lost the Rough Water Swim and 5,000 yuan.

175
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,330
And I did CPR on you.

176
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,640
I lost my first kiss.

177
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,250
It’s CPR, not a kiss.

178
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,780
My lips were on your lips.

179
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,560
What’s the difference?

180
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,310
You must compensate for my loss

181
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,790
and the reward of the race.

182
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:18,940
Are you blackmailing me?

183
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,530
I saved your life.

184
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,590
And you compensate my loss.

185
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,660
Isn’t that what it is?

186
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,010
OK.

187
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,730
How much do you want?

188
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:49,300
I’ll pay you.

189
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:52,570
To save you,

190
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,180
I lost 5,000 yuan in the Rough Water Swim.

191
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,910
1,000 yuan for salvage

192
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:59,610
and 1,000 for CPR.

193
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,740
That’s blackmailing.

198

199

8,000 yuan in total.

200
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,270
Your first kiss is only worth  1,000 yuan?

201
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,200
I regret that I saved you.

202
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,500
Give me the money.

I can write you an IOU.

As for the deviation of 0.01 km2,

275

please give me another chance.

276
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,470
Because of the deviation of 0.01 km2,

Director Liu,

279
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,010
Mr. Shan went on a field study
in Guanmei Fishing Village.

280
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:47,710
In the safe waters you planned,

281
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:49,650
his yacht ran on a rock

282
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:51,000
which almost got him killed.

283
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,580
There’s no “more or less” in Senwell,

284
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:56,940
but only 100% accurate.

285

There’s no need to ask.

Mr. Shan,

319
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,470
you advanced the starting date of the project.

320
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,320
Is it a little bit risky?

321
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:09,480
We start two weeks earlier.

322
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:11,680
Then construction will be completed
two weeks earlier.

323
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:12,450
Accordingly,

324
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,400

Conmen are so bold nowadays.

349
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:31,520

350
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:46,970
How do you do, Mr. Tang?

351
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:47,600

Director of Operation Department of Senwell.

355
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:53,160
I don’t care.

356
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:54,130
Like I said,

357
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:55,810
I talk to Shan Junhao only today.

358
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:58,160
Mr. Tang,

359
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:00,840
you can tell me about your request first.

360
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:02,330
I speak on behalf of Mr. Shan.

361
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,680
We received a Demolition Notice

362
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,720
from you concerning Guanmei Hotel.

363
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:08,660
I want to ask Shan Junhao face to face that

364
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,870
why he can demolish my hotel in advance.

365
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,510
Because of your loan delinquencies, Mr. Tang.

366
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:14,840
Principal and interest together,

367
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,270
your debt adds up to 8 million yuan.

368
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,560
And the payment is late for 3 months.

369
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,870
As the creditor,

370
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:22,840
we have the right to recall Guanmei Hotel.

371
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,120
What?

372
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,520
You lost the reward and were cheated?

373
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:29,850
Ye Qianyu, are you a fool?

374
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:32,210
You eat two bowls of rice every meal.

375
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:32,990
It should make you smarter!

376
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,800
The main component of rice is starch.

377
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:38,150
Starch doesn’t make people smarter.

378
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:42,740
= IOU =

379
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,040
Rotten liar!

380
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,620
Next time I meet him,

381
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,190
I’m gonna chop him up.

382
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:49,580
I’m gonna chop you up first!

383
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,540
Do you see that?

384
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,160
= Debtor: Tonghao =
Whose name is like this?

385
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,430
Tonghao?

386
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:59,590
He looks like a rich man to me.

387
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:02,240
I didn’t know he’s a liar.

388
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:04,160
He looks like?

389
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,340
Do I look like a rich person?

390
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:15,810
Yes.

391
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,020
All right.

392
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:18,670
Go deliver the goods!

393
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:19,570
Go deliver the goods!

394
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:21,200
Without the reward, you better start making money.

395
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:22,670
Go!

396
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:26,440
But you agreed

397
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,820
to give me a month to raise money.

398
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:29,310
Now it hasn’t been two weeks

399
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,220
and you want to demolish my hotel.

400
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:31,790
You…

401
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,860
You break our agreement!

402
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,260
So far,

403
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,750
you can only give it up.

404
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,070
But I can promise you

405
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:40,520
a reasonable amount of compensation.

406
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,810
Compensation?

407
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,220
I don’t give a toss.

408
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:44,530
We’ve been running

409
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:46,230
the hotel for decades since my grandpa.

410
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,190
You ask me to sell it?

411
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,090
How am I going to face my ancestors?

412
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,370
I’m telling you.

413
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,040
If you want to demolish it,

414
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,860
you have to kill me first.

415
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:00,160
You don’t have the say.

416
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,260
I have to meet Shan Junhao.

417
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:04,180
Stop him!

418
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:05,800
Mr. Tang!

419
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:13,130
Mr. Tang!

420
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,220
Mr. Tang!

421
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:22,220
What are you doing?

422
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:31,970
Who are you?

423
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:32,860
I’m Tang Shunming,

424
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,910
the owner of Guanmei Hotel
in Guanmei Fishing Village.

425
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:38,100
Don’t come closer.

426
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:38,530
Easy!

427
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:39,690
Calm down!

428
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:43,520
Hello, Yunyi?

429
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,550
Come over. Tang Shunming is making a scene.

430
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:46,310
What?

431
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,480
Let’s have a break.

432
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:09,670
Zhao Qun,

433
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,040
go check it out.

434
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,210
Yes, Mr. Zhang.

435
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:24,350
Hello, Sheng?

436
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,250
= Guanmei Hotel =
Hello, Qianyu? Bad news!

437
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,370
= Guanmei Hotel =
Guanmei Hotel is going to be torn down.

438
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:28,380
What?

439
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:29,890
We couldn’t find Tang just now.

440
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:30,930
So we went in his room.

441
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:32,790
= Demolition Notice =
Then we found the Demolition Notice.

442
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:35,510
Wait, who wants to tear Guanmei Hotel down?

443
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,600
Senwell.

444
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,660
Senwell Group.

445
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,880
Senwell?

446
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,670
OK, I’ll go have a look.

447
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:44,590
Wait for my news.

448
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:45,960
Where are you going?

449
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:46,820
Mom, Tang is in trouble.

450
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,640
I’m going to have a look.

451
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:53,900
What about the delivery?

452
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:55,450
Hey!

453
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:59,580
Tang Shunming, you butterball!

454
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,860
You call Qianyu off again!

455
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:01,840
Don’t do it!

456
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:02,720
Stay back, all of you!

457
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:03,300
Put it down!

458
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:03,740
Stay back!

459
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,020
Put it down!

460
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:04,430
Stay back!

461
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:04,780
Down!

462
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,920
You can’t pay for my life.

463
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:06,720
I’ll cut myself!

464
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:07,720
Stay back! Back up!

465
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,710
All of you, back up!

466
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:09,780
Go! Back!

467
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:11,350
Mr. Tang, calm down.

468
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:12,590
Let’s talk.

469
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,790
I have nothing to talk to you.

470
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:15,440
Mr. Tang, calm down.

471
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,950
If I die in Senwell today,

472
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:19,360
the media will know.

473
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:20,880
You can’t cover it up.

474
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:21,620
Mr. Tang,

475
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,780
your death can’t solve the problem.

476
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,160
Because all Senwell’s decisions

477
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,280
conform with the laws.

478
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,280
If you kill yourself,

479
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,970
there’s no way we can solve it.

480
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,980
I’m in a dead end.

481
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,170
Which way do I have now?

482
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:34,130
Where there’s a will, there’s a way.

483
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:36,300
As long as you’re alive,
you can think of something.

484
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:36,540
Right.

485
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,280
You force me into this.

486
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:40,420
You have to give me an explanation.

487
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,000
Mr. Tang.

488
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,400
Calm down, Mr. Tang.

489
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,600
What explanation do you expect from Senwell?

490
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:46,580
Mr. Shan.

491
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:48,700
Junhao.

492
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,810
Shan Junhao!

493
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:54,510
It’s me.

494
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,340
Because of you,

495
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:58,600
I’m about to lose everything.

496
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:59,820
You don’t pay your debt

497
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,780
and you stir up the trouble.

498
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,640
Senwell will not be threatened by you.

499
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:03,810
I’m gonna cut now.

500
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,000
I’ll kill myself here.

501
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:07,010
Senwell will hit tomorrow’s headline.

502
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,430
The media will focus their attention

503
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:10,640
on the development of Guanmei Fishing Village.

504
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:11,610
By then,

505
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:13,530
Senwell will be condemned.

506
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:15,300
And you will not

507
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,060
take a pebble from Guanmei Fishing Village,

508
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,170
let alone my hotel.

509
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,090
May I help you?

510
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:29,300
I’m here to look for someone.

511
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:29,930
I’m sorry.

512
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:31,220
Senwell doesn’t do interviews now.

513
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,260
Is Tang Shunming

514
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,170
from Guanmei Hotel here?

515
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,260
I’m here for him.

516
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,180
He’s my uncle.

517
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:38,220
Tang Shunming?

518
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:39,380
Tang Shunming,

519
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,740
you think you’ll draw public attention by suicide?

520
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,370
Let me tell you. You won’t.

521
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:47,080
Even your suicide is on news,

522
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,910
it just gives people something
to talk about for now.

523
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:51,230
Soon, it’ll be forgotten.

524
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:53,620
Then I’ll let you suffer in conscience

525
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,610
and leave a moral stain

526
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:58,240
on Senwell’s reputation with my blood.

527
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,090
OK.

528
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:02,450
Mr. Shan.

529
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:03,850
If you want to die,

530
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:05,870
then go ahead.

531
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:06,350
You…

532
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:08,950
You’ll regret it.

533
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,240
I’ll cut my throat now.

534
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,220
But I want to tell you that

535
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:16,540
that’s not your carotid.

536
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:18,170
If you cut the wrong position,

537
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,350
you can’t die.

538
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:21,130
What’s worse, it may block your airway,

539
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:22,180
which causes more pain.

540
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,740
If you don’t cut deep enough,

541
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,660
you’ll become a vegetable

542
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,440
due to emergent loss of oxygen

543
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,690
in your brain.

544
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:29,160
That’s more painful than death.

545
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:31,460
However, if you cut the right position,

546
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,290
your blood

547
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:34,230
will spray to two meters high

548
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,510
and you’ll become a mummy in five minutes

549
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:38,070
due to massive blood loss.

550
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:40,350
Don’t try to scare me.

551
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:41,340
I have to say.

552
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:43,100
Mr. Tang, I do admire you.

553
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:43,830
But,

554
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,710
please allow me to point out

555
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,030
the carotid for you.

556
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:48,830
Don’t come over.

557
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:54,880
Stay where you are.

558
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,400
You can watch my finger

559
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:59,620
and follow my instruction.

560
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:03,940
Move two centimeters to the left

561
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,640
until you feel

562
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,900
the pulse of your carotid.

563
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,720
There it is.

564
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:14,700
Mr. Shan, watch out!

565
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:20,800
Let me go! Get off me!

566
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,470
It’s a stupid thing to threaten

567
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,860
others with your own life.

568
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,460
= Beverage Bar =

569
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,470
Mr. Tang.

570
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:20,280
Are you alright?

571
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:27,500
Don’t give yourself too much pressure.

572
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,730
In fact, according to our Credit Agreement,

573
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,760
if you can raise enough money in a month

574
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:32,640
and pay the debt,

575
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,320
you’re given preferential right

576
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,190
to buy Guanmei Hotel’s shares.

577
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:41,330
A month?

578
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:45,950
It won’t help.

579
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:48,800
He’s in.

580
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:53,130
Tang! Tang!

581
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:54,740
Tang, are you alright?

582
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,030
Yes.

583
00:33:57,050 --> 00:33:58,020
I’m fine, Qianyu.

584
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,150
Why do you do that?

585
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,000
Guanmei Hotel means nothing to you.

586
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,650
But to Tang,

587
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:11,140
it’s everything.

588
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,460
Different stances. No explanation.

589
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:19,430
I just want to say

590
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:20,830
sorry.

591
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,090
I…

592
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:24,040
All right, Qianyu.

593
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,180
It really has nothing

594
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,070
to do with Director Xu.

595
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:31,940
OK, Tang.

596
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,200
Let’s go home.

597
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,590
OK.

598
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:36,550
Hi!

599
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:38,390
We do not buy at this door.

600
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:39,620
We don’t need anything, either.

601
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,730
Toilet on the outside to the right.

602
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:44,410
Our toilet is open to customers only.

603
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:45,590
No, I’m…

604
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,460
We don’t need extra hands, either.

605
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,500
The old house is going to be demolished.

606
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,630
We’re about to lose our jobs.

607
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,160
I want to say that

608
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,900
I need a room.

609
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:58,480
A room?

610
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,470
You want a room?

611
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,200
Nice to meet you.

612
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,090
Welcome!

613
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:06,500
Can you tell me what kind of room do you prefer?

614
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,320
Let me help.

615
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:10,310
But you said that

616
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,200
it’s gonna be demolished.

617
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:13,730
Yes.

618
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,720
You’d better go to the downtown…

619
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,040
It’s not demolished yet.

620
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,600
Do you want a business suite, standard room,

621
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,640
or VIP suite?

622
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,850
Can I take a look of the room first?

623
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:25,880
Of course.

624
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:26,720
I’ll show you the way. Come along.

625
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:27,550
This way please.

626
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:28,700
Please.

627
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:37,780
Sir, come in.

628
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:40,960
In Guanmei Fishing Village,

629
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,310
our hotel is…

630
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,760
Every book and every object here

631
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:49,110
have their special meaning and story.

632
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:50,950
Sir,

633
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:53,200
on the upstairs is your bedroom.

634
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,620
By the way,

635
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:55,900
the most noted feature

636
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,630
of our hotel is that

637
00:36:58,370 --> 00:37:00,320
you can see the ocean in the day

638
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,890
and watch stars at night.

639
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:06,410
Too dusty.

640
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:08,390
Excuse us.

641
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:09,860
It’s a sea view room. Wind is strong.

642
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,140
Gosh!

643
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:24,050
What’s up?

644
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:27,550
I want some excise.

645
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:28,970
I like excise.

646
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:30,640
Sports.

647
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,370
We love sports.

648
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:32,370
I love sports, too.

649
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,050
So, sir, how do you like the room?

650
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:38,540
Great, this is it.

651
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:40,960
Here.

652
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:43,630
Check me in.

653
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,660
I’ll get it done now.

654
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:56,420
He’s been to so many countries.

655
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,560
Goodness!

656
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:06,420
I never expected that before we make a move,

657
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:09,470
Shan Junhao came a cropper.

658
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:11,680
But it’s great.

659
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:14,380
Saved us the trouble.

660
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,370
That’s the consequence of his rash decision.

661
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:22,900
He urged to advance
Guanmei Fishing Village project

662
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:25,350
and got Tang Shuming here.

663
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:29,150
Each of Shan Junhao’s mistakes

664
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,240
will become our trump card.
