I don’t agree.

12

Well.

13
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,540
I just asked Tonghao

14
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,810
to be an advisor of Guanmei Hotel.

15
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,230
You don’t need to feel so upset.

16
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,630
Tonghao is my staff.

17
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:54,090
You are not justified

18
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,360
to poach my people.

19
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,010
He has the freedom to choose his job.

20
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:58,180
He

21
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,560
wishes to help me at Guanmei Hotel

22
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:00,740
and I wish to recruit him.

23
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,050
It is something between us.

24
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,070
Tonghao is helping me reform Money Bag Grocery.

25
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:06,190
He is my staff.

26
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,720
So it is something between us.

27
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,040
You?

28
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,810
Do you pay any wage to Tonghao?

29
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,230
Do you sign any employment contract?

30
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:13,900
You are a real

31
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,270
miser indeed.

32
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:15,960
You.

33
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,530
He…

34
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,480
He owed us

35
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,040
and he must work for us free of charge to pay.

36
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,250
How much does he owe you?

37
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,290
I will pay for him.

38
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,510
Yes.

39
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:26,520
You are really generous.

40
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,710
Why didn’t you pay

41
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,920
Shengzhe’s maintenance fee upon our divorce then?

42
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,750
Do you think I am such a fool?

43
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,710
OK, enough.

44
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:34,730
Don’t always quarrel

45
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,150
whenever you meet each other.

46
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,990
It is very simple.

47
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,100
It is a perfect solution

48
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,200
if Tang pays the wage of Tonghao

49
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,110
directly to Chen, right?

50
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:49,610
I agree.

51
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,290
Good idea! Good idea!

52
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:51,790
What a good idea!

53
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:58,600
I request

54
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,020
paying one month’s salary in advance.

55
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,230
Why?

56
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,200
I know very well that

57
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,740
you haven’t paid any wage
to Sheng and others for long.

58
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,760
I will never allow you
to exploit Tonghao and his labor.

59
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,410
OK,

60
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,750
it is a deal.

61
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:20,980
Er.

62
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:21,700
OK.

63
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,100
Come to work tomorrow.

64
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:24,500
OK.

65
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,500
Just transfer the money to my account tomorrow.

66
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,840
What do you mean?

67
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,400
I will transfer the money
one month after his service.

68
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,570
Didn’t you hear what I had said?

69
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,200
I told you

70
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,450
to pay one month’s salary in advance.

71
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:33,440
Pay in advance! Pay in advance!

72
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,650
We had better leave

73
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,360
and leave them alone.

74
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,140
Go, go, go.

75
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:37,660
Pay in advance.

76
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,230
Do you know paying in advance?

77
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:39,520
Gosh.

78
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,240
Chen Jinzhi,

79
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,420
do you have anything else in your mind

80
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,630
other than money?

81
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:43,580
Stop talking nonsense.

82
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,270
Unless I receive the money…

83
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:46,340
Money talks.

84
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,200
Listen, if you have the money,

85
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,820
- you can make the mare go!
- He’s my staff now!

86
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,060
= Guanmei Hotel =

87
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:51,790
Fengqiao,

88
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,580
please make the bedding

89
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,250
of each room

90
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,330
in the way I taught you today.

91
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,030
OK.

92
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,320
I will fulfill the duty.

93
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,190
Sheng,

94
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,760
rearrange the restaurant

95
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,810
on the second floor today.

96
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,550
Replace all the old tablecloths.

97
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:04,620
OK, no problem.

98
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,620
I have also made a new menu

99
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,150
for the customer’s free choice.

100
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,760
We only lack a receptionist now.

101
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,240
As Tonghao said,

102
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,540
receptionist represents our hotel’s image.

103
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,440
So we must find

104
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:17,880
a young

105
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:18,820
pretty

106
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:20,780
and graceful girl.

107
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,680
Such an important position

108
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,340
must certainly be taken by me,

109
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,150
the No. 1 beauty of Guanmei.

110
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,100
Why are you here instead of

111
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:32,850
staying at the piano store?

112
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,050
Mr. Tang is smart enough

113
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,860
to invite me here.

114
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:38,200
Su Liyin,

115
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,560
please roll up your hair in the future.

116
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,040
Otherwise, your hair will just roll down.

117
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:43,790
OK.

118
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:45,660
I am pretty regardless of the hair style anyway.

119
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What is my job then?

120
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,010
You are in charge of company publicity.

121
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,590
What is company publicity?

122
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,950
Why are some people only in charge of beauty?

123
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,720
Company publicity is a very important job.

124
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,340
You have very strong communication

125
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,280
and planning abilities,

126
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,530
so only you are qualified

127
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,730
for this job.

128
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,600
Really?

129
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,280
What you need to do first

130
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:08,390
is to renew the photos and profiles

131
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:09,470
posted on various major platforms

132
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,600
and display the best of Guanmei Inn

133
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,560
to all customers.

134
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,080
OK.

135
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:14,700
Qianyu,

136
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:15,770
I can help you take photos.

137
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:16,430
OK.

138
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:21,820
From now on,

139
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,320
let’s work hard together.

140
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:26,100
Go ahead together.

141
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,100
= Guanmei Hotel =

142
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:04,550
Wait a minute.

143
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,370
So beautiful in photos.

144
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,040
Qianyu,

145
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,720
what on earth did Tonghao do before?

146
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,110
He has lost his memory. How can I know that?

147
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,480
Lost his memory?

148
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:53,420
He is Mama Jinzhi’s distant relative.

149
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,830
We were not familiar with each other before.

150
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:57,980
Not familiar.

151
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,080
Without adequate industrial experiences,

152
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,260
it is very hard to point out the problems.

153
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,520
So

154
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:06,190
he is not a simple person.

155
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:08,930
Of course.

156
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,540
Tonghao planned to give up before

157
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,990
but started to work on it
for unknown reasons later.

158
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,230
But

159
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,650
do you think it is useful?

160
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:20,810
Of course, it is useful.

161
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,250
If we hold on,

162
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,910
we will make it.

163
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:26,570
Do you mean

164
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:27,770
we can save Guanmei Hotel?

165
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,320
Great!

166
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,830
I wish Tonghao had shown up earlier.

167
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,900
But Senwell already acquired

168
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,270
the development right of Guanmei Fishing Village

169
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,680
and the project must proceed.

170
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,980
What will you do?

171
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,000
Actually I know

172
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,480
Guanmei Fishing Village is too backward.

173
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,760
I’ve have been the guide
of many tourists who came here.

174
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,070
They all felt

175
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,180
Guanmei Fishing Village

176
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:55,970
lacked good planning

177
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,730
though it’s very beautiful.

178
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,130
But I just don’t understand

179
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,120
why Senwell has to have

180
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,780
irreconcilable conflicts with us?

181
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,310
Actually,

182
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,090
we are also a very important part

183
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,240
of Guanmei Fishing Village.

184
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:13,410
Maybe

185
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,570
it is our presence here

186
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,510
that makes Guanmei Fishing Village what it is now.

187
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:18,350
Don’t you think so?

188
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,060
Maybe I can help you.

189
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:25,880
You are already helping us.

190
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,630
Qianyu,

191
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:31,370
I want to visit the heavenly pit
you mentioned before.

192
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:33,570
Some other day.

193
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,000
I will arrange the balcony of the second floor
with Tonghao today.

194
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:39,100
OK.

195
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,980
Ziqian,

196
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:09,820
do you have any message
about Junhao’s whereabouts?

197
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:18,670
Uncle Shan,

198
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,970
Junhao’s whereabouts is still unknown.

199
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,660
Don’t cheat me.

200
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,880
Just tell me the truth.

201
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,360
Yaolong,

202
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:38,690
we have always been looking for Junhao.

203
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:41,610
But we haven’t

204
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,870
got any message about him.

205
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:53,280
Ziqian,

206
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,510
I have brought you up personally.

207
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,020
I know

208
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:02,590
you are a considerate person.

209
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,360
I can read your mind

210
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,270
even if you don’t tell me.

211
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:17,260
Yunyi,

212
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:21,030
you are a straightforward girl.

213
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:24,380
I know you have been trying to cover it up.

214
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,060
I have brought you up personally too.

215
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,880
You can never

216
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,140
hide your pains from me.

217
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,290
OK.

218
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,610
Stop talking.

219
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,680
Take care of yourself.

220
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:50,460
- Have more rest. - Uncle Shan.

221
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:51,330
Dad.

222
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,170
Ziqian,

223
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:53,800
come here.

224
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,410
Come here. Come here.

225
00:10:58,330 --> 00:10:59,290
Uncle Shan.

226
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,270
Ziqian.

227
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,080
Please

228
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,150
take good care of

229
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,420
the Shans and Senwell.

230
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,520
Uncle Shan,

231
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,940
I will certainly take good care
of Aunt Jiang and Yunyi.

232
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,850
You will be OK too.

233
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:24,850
Ziqian,

234
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:30,160
I am so sorry for you.

235
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:31,280
I…

236
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:35,150
Uncle Shan.

237
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:35,880
Yaolong!

238
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,500
Uncle Shan!

239
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,620
Dad!

240
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,710
- Yaolong! - Uncle Shan!

241
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:43,310
Uncle Shan!

242
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:45,110
Call the doctor right away!

243
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,190
Hurry up!

244
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,480
Doctor!

245
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,580
Hurry up!

246
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,330
Excuse me.

247
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,920
Hurry up!

248
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:04,960
Dad!

249
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,060
Yaolong!

250
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,410
Yaolong!

251
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,970
Uncle Shan!

252
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,750
Dad!

253
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:02,790
As a man, you can’t even move a chair well.

254
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,670
Tonghao, are you OK?

255
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,050
What’s wrong with you?

256
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,830
I don’t know.

257
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,090
I suddenly feel very sad.

258
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,790
My heart is empty.

259
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,090
Do you think of something?

260
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,900
I just feel a little sad suddenly

261
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:50,580
as if

262
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:55,290
I had lost something important.

263
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,980
Maybe it has something to do with your past.

264
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,190
Maybe.

265
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,290
Maybe your family is missing you

266
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,550
or your family is worrying about you.

267
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,650
As we have telepathy with our family,

268
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,700
however far away it may be,

269
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,830
we can always feel it.

270
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,050
But

271
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:26,140
I can’t remember anything about them.

272
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,700
Moreover, I am not sure

273
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,310
if I have a family.

274
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,800
Tonghao,

275
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,180
actually…

276
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:42,900
Qianyu,

277
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,170
you are

278
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,600
my family to me.

279
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:52,240
In my memory,

280
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:55,520
you are the first person

281
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,860
I have met and known.

282
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:02,990
Thank you!

283
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:06,170
Thank you

284
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,090
for having filled the gap in my memory.

285
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,010
Why are you looking at me that way?

286
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,400
Tonghao,

287
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:33,210
I don’t know whether you belong here or not.

288
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,900
But I am afraid

289
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,450
you will leave one day.

290
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,010
Why do I have to leave?

291
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,020
I feel very happy here.

292
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,000
Because

293
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,900
in my world,

294
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,080
you are my only acquaintance.

295
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:17,910
What are you doing?

296
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,930
I need your support.

297
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,340
Why?

298
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,270
Your shoulder bone makes me very painful.

299
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,130
Hey.

300
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,410
But it feels very warm.

301
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:19,740
= Guanmei Inn =

302
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:26,560
Bravo! Bravo!

303
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:29,440
Let’s work hard together from now on

304
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,330
and turn Guanmei Inn into

305
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,030
the best homestay at Guanmei Fishing Village.

306
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:34,260
Great!

307
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,410
Tang,

308
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,740
you are so ambitious.

309
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:38,730
But

310
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,810
our Guanmei Inn

311
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:42,410
must become the best homestay of China.

312
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:43,420
- Yes! - OK!

313
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,080
OK.

314
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,950
Let’s work hard

315
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,230
and go ahead together.

316
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:50,350
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead!

317
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:02,140
Welcome, welcome, welcome!

318
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,780
Welcome, welcome.

319
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,950
Come on, everybody comes up here.

320
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:11,820
It is completely different from
one year ago when I was here.

321
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,410
Yes.

322
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,410
Our Guanmei Hotel

323
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,120
has undergone a general brand regeneration

324
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,810
and made it a brand new Guanmei Inn.

325
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:18,510
I guarantee that

326
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,230
our services will be satisfactory to all.

327
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,130
OK.

328
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:23,930
Please come in.

329
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:26,400
Come in, please.

330
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,150
Let me carry it.

331
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:28,960
Come in, please.

332
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,020
Let me help you.

333
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,950
We have everything here.

334
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:35,870
Just enjoy yourself.

335
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,120
OK.

336
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:37,990
Check in here.

337
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:39,300
It’ll finish soon.

338
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,690
Guide.

339
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:43,070
We also offer free VIP package to tour guide,

340
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:43,780
OK?

341
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,330
Great, thank you!

342
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,050
You are welcome.

343
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:46,860
Come and eat something.

344
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,730
Hope you enjoy your stay here.

345
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,340
Please let me know if you need me.

346
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,730
I will keep the key for you.

347
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,220
Thanks.

348
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,090
You are welcome.

349
00:18:58,690 --> 00:18:59,220
OK, OK.

350
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,540
OK, OK.

351
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,330
OK, OK.

352
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,830
No. 7 Team of Guanmei.

353
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,290
Let’s go in and have a rest.

354
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,020
Go into the room, everybody.

355
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,910
This way, please.

356
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:13,580
Good.

357
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,730
Let me do it.

358
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,230
Zhang Minghan,

359
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,190
what do you mean?

360
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,310
I just want to elect a new general manager

361
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,960
according to the board resolution.

362
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,450
Mr. Shan isn’t back.

363
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,030
Why do we need a new general manager?

364
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:49,220
Shan Junhao didn’t even attend

365
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,190
his father’s funeral.

366
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,180
Do you think he will come back?

367
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,020
Director Xu,

368
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,520
Mr. Shan Junhao

369
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,470
has disappeared for so long.

370
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,470
And Chairman Shan Yaolong

371
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,210
is dead now.

372
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:06,660
Our Senwell

373
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,140
can’t operate without a leader.

374
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,080
Mr. Shan will certainly come back.

375
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,910
Then please tell us

376
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,710
when he will come back.

377
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:20,290
Director Xu,

378
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,000
Miss Fan,

379
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,240
you are not qualified to
speak out at a board meeting.

380
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:26,500
OK.

381
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,260
No more quarrel.

382
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,610
Dear everyone,

383
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,080
Chairman Shan has passed away.

384
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,880
He transferred all his shares to me.

385
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:44,630
But I am not able to lead the group

386
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,860
as I have been a housewife
for more than twenty years.

387
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,260
We are

388
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,700
in the same boat now.

389
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,140
I hope you can work together

390
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:59,960
for the general benefits of our group.

391
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,770
I agree.

392
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:09,040
The rumors are spreading quickly.

393
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,260
They say the senior management of Senwell

394
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,680
is undergoing complete changes

395
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:16,230
so that many of our project investors

396
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,620
maintain a suspicious and hesitant
attitude towards us.

397
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,620
If it continues,

398
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:25,270
I am afraid our company may
be launched into chaos.

399
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:28,010
For the general good of Senwell,

400
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,690
we must elect a new general manager today.

401
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:36,090
Vice president Zhang Minghan

402
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,090
has the right to exercise the powers
of the general manager for now.

403
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,590
Vice president Zhang Minghan

404
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:42,800
has always been a diligent person

405
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,310
who works for the general good of our group.

406
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,200
So

407
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,370
I recommend

408
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,870
electing Vice president Zhang Minghan

409
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,640
as our general manager.

410
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:52,650
Dear everybody,

411
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,640
how do you think about it?

412
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:55,850
I agree.

413
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:57,970
I agree too.

414
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,320
I agree.

415
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,670
I agree too.

416
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:02,790
I agree.

417
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,560
Can I trust you,

418
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:24,880
Minghan?

419
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:28,720
Mrs. Shan,

420
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,610
I know you have always complained about me.

421
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,640
But I just wonder

422
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,900
why I have to do anything harmful to Senwell.

423
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:41,880
My father also has part of the shares

424
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,450
in Senwell.

425
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:48,300
I only want to make Senwell bigger and better.

426
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,970
I hope you will

427
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,380
honor my trust.

428
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,350
Mom.

429
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,140
Mom.

430
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:46,120
Why did you have to compromise?

431
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:47,660
Yunyi,

432
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,760
we had no other choice.

433
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:52,580
Zhang Minghan has bought off all other directors.

434
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,720
Even if he didn’t get it today,

435
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,730
he will get it tomorrow.

436
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,410
We have no other choice.

437
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,520
Zhang Minghan

438
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:04,780
is really the only candidate of general manager.

439
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:07,040
But

440
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,770
he will certainly be the only decision-maker.

441
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,680
So

442
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,820
I am prepared for it.

443
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:25,440
Ziqian,

444
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:27,850
I hereby formally authorize you

445
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,170
as the interim chairman.

446
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:31,330
Only in this way

447
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,350
can we restrict Zhang Minghan.

448
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,460
Twenty rooms in total.

449
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:54,990
Plus catering fees.

450
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,020
Plus service fees.

451
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,570
Minus the costs.

452
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:01,580
5,200.

453
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:05,900
Boss,

454
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,570
this is the first time that Guanmei Inn

455
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,400
has had such a high income since our opening.

456
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:11,420
Guide Lin also said

457
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,610
she would take other tourists here in the future.

458
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,540
I am so touched.

459
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,020
I want to cry.

460
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,290
Sheng,

461
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,730
please don’t

462
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,300
be a sissy

463
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,310
at such a crucial moment.

464
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:24,000
’Isn’t it good?

465
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,880
But I also want to cry.

466
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,170
Tonghao,

467
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,860
it seems you are an inborn businessman.

468
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:33,000
Thanks.

469
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:35,240
Also, Taichu

470
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,750
only as a tourist,

471
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:38,970
is a real expert in management.

472
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:41,490
I know it is all because of my beauty

473
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,950
that such great fortune comes.

474
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,340
But Tonghao and Taichu’s methods

475
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,810
are really useful.

476
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:50,260
Your beauty is attractive to men

477
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,210
instead of fortune.

478
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:53,510
Ye Qianyu,

479
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:55,690
don’t you ever always envy my beauty?

480
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:56,140
Yes,

481
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:56,730
I envy.

482
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:57,980
I envy you so much.

483
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,770
Tonghao,

484
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,870
I will send the datasheet to you

485
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:05,980
via WeChat later.

486
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,130
OK.

487
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,230
You are friends on WeChat?

488
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:14,970
Qianyu,

489
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,850
all men in Guanmei Fishing Village

490
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:19,490
are WeChat friends of Su Liyin.

491
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,000
Excluding me

492
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:22,930
because I am in her blacklist.

493
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,820
Sheng,

494
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:27,860
if I were you, I would

495
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,460
just

496
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:29,760
jump down from here.

497
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,140
Why are you looking at me?

498
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,580
Taichu,

499
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,150
can I send the datasheet to you

500
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:44,340
via WeChat later too?

501
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:45,690
OK.

502
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:48,070
My email address is taichu@gemail.com.

503
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,570
All dishes are ready.

504
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:54,710
Let’s start the meal.

505
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:57,870
Come on, help yourself.

506
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:58,450
We have many delicious foods here.

507
00:26:58,470 --> 00:26:59,770
Come on, help yourself.

508
00:27:01,239 --> 00:27:03,400
All the great achievements today

509
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,640
are due to the hard work of all.

510
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,400
Come on,

511
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:06,440
Come on! cheers!

512
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,210
Bottoms up!

513
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:09,780
Bottoms up!

514
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,630
OK.

515
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,320
Help yourself.

516
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:19,370
Very delicious.

517
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,080
Tonghao.

518
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,160
Nothing special.

519
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:31,030
Just help yourself

520
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,280
and eat to your full.

521
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,200
Yes.

522
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:34,950
OK.

523
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:36,230
Tang,

524
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:38,750
are you willing to add Tonghao’s WeChat too?

525
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,060
What’s WeChat?

526
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,830
I don’t play things like this.

527
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:47,420
I just wonder, Tonghao,

528
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:50,450
if you will continue to help Guanmei Inn

529
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:53,940
when you get your memories back one day.

530
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,650
Of course, I will.

531
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:01,290
Because

532
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,510
I must work for those who I care about.

533
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,210
Tang,

534
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,280
that is really a strange idea.

535
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:10,470
Why will Tonghao give up the hotel

536
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:11,360
he has developed personally?

537
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,010
Moreover, I found

538
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,510
Tonghao is really an expert in hotel management.

539
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:18,340
Of course.

540
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:18,850
Help yourself.

541
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,740
Just think who he is.

542
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:23,030
No.

543
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,700
I said we must eat up all the dishes.

544
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:26,830
OK.

545
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:27,530
Delicious.

546
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,880
It is delicious.

547
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,320
Eat more.

548
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,530
Try this one.

549
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,970
Really yummy.

550
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,320
Come on.

551
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:37,880
Qianyu,

552
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:39,060
eat more.

553
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:39,640
Thanks.

554
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,560
Enough.

555
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:41,970
I am full.

556
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:43,070
Thanks.

557
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:45,230
Just eat more.

558
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:50,480
You too.

559
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,390
Come on, don’t waste the foods.

560
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:30,610
General manager.

561
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:31,420
Zhao Qun,

562
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:34,340
notify the Engineering Department

563
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,440
to get ready

564
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:37,640
and start the construction of Guanmei Project

565
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:38,620
tomorrow.

566
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:39,860
OK,

567
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,470
general manager.

568
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:45,550
Director Qiu and Director Lin.

569
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:49,770
Mr. Zhang,

570
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,500
Mrs. Shan authorized Xu Ziqian

571
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,830
as the interim chairman.

572
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:55,870
What?

573
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:58,250
It was publicized just now.

574
00:29:59,010 --> 00:29:59,540
Yes.

575
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:04,590
It seems Mrs. Shan knows the trick of balance well

576
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,620
even if she is a housewife.

577
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:08,790
But it doesn’t matter.

578
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,000
An interim chairman without shares

579
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:12,960
is just a paper tiger.

580
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,790
Yes.

581
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:17,280
You can go now.

582
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:19,200
Let’s go.

583
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,120
Congratulations, Ziqian,

584
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,730
for your promotion from a petty director

585
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,580
to interim chairman.

586
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,430
Zhang Minghan,

587
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,860
you finally fulfilled your wish.

588
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:44,120
I should have become
Senwell’s general manager earlier.

589
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,800
I hope to have your cooperation

590
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,660
at work in the future.

591
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,340
As the interim chairman,

592
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:56,060
I am in charge of the company’s major decisions

593
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:57,920
instead of cooperating with you.

594
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,620
Ziqian,

595
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,250
you have gone too far

596
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:11,490
in your loyalty and protection of the Shans.

597
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,900
I hope you can have a sober mind.

598
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:17,180
Otherwise, you will be cheated like a fool.

599
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:19,480
What do you mean?

600
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:23,450
Chairman Xu, your father,

601
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:25,350
used to be one of
the three shareholders of the company.

602
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:28,680
Even if he had a very good relationship
with Shan Yaolong,

603
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:31,620
he wouldn’t have transferred
all his shares to others.

604
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:33,890
Don’t you feel very strange?

605
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,670
Haven’t you have any suspicion?

606
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:38,800
Don’t make irresponsible remarks
to instigate conflicts.

607
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:40,750
Not everybody

608
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:43,290
prioritizes benefits like you in the world.

609
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:45,110
Not everybody is so kindhearted and naive

610
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:47,370
like you in the world, either.

611
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:50,630
My father

612
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:52,650
voluntarily transferred his shares.

613
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:55,360
Friendship and liberty are
the most important to him,

614
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,250
so it is with me.

615
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,070
Ziqian,

616
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:00,940
I am just considering it

617
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,160
from your perspective.

618
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,670
Don’t be too silly,

619
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:06,330
or you will be cheated.

620
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,250
Don’t be too shameless,

621
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,340
or you will be punished.

622
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:39,070
Do I have to tell Senwell

623
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:41,770
that Shan Junhao is at Guanmei Fishing Village.

624
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,830
No.

625
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:48,230
I can’t.

626
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,160
If Shan Junhao is back to Senwell,

627
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:53,910
he will dismantle my Guanmei Hotel right away.

628
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:11,910
Folks.

629
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:21,340
Lots of money.

630
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,820
Also excavators.

631
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:35,490
Zhang Minghan,

632
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,680
what on earth are you doing?

633
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:38,180
Mr. Tang,

634
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:42,080
don’t you remember that it’s the farewell day

635
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:43,680
for Guanmei Inn today?

636
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,520
Farewell day?

637
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:47,340
Do you want to dismantle Guanmei Inn?

638
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:49,730
Boss,

639
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:51,320
will it be dismantled?

640
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,900
Our business is going up now.

641
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,140
Hello, Mr. Tang?

642
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:03,890
Director Xu.

643
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:06,150
Didn’t you agree to

644
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:08,030
give me a grace period if I told you

645
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:09,290
the truth about Shan Junhao?

646
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:11,500
But Senwell already dispatched people

647
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,600
to dismantle Guanmei Inn
before Mr. Shan was back to Senwell.

648
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:14,930
Dismantle your inn?

649
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:15,980
Who is that?

650
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,350
Mr. Zhang.

651
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:22,460
I will be there right away.

652
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,330
OK.

653
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,210
What’s up?

654
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:28,500
Zhang Minghan and his people are going
to dismantle Guanmei Inn.

655
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,110
What?

656
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:29,950
Go.

657
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,270
Dear villagers,

658
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,440
I know your biggest concern.

659
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,370
Senwell has tripled the compensation.

660
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:42,920
Not every real estate developer can do this.

661
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:46,270
It shows Senwell’s sincerity to you all.

662
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:48,570
You can take away the money right away.

663
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:49,890
But

664
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,950
you must sign a contract.

665
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:55,860
Hello, Ye Qianyu?

666
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,180
Guanmei Inn is in big trouble.

667
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:57,830
Come here right away.

668
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,270
So much money, am I dreaming?

669
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,120
Triple the standard compensations?

670
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,180
Yes.

671
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:02,840
Zhang Minghan,

672
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,590
you can’t do this.

673
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:05,680
Mr. Tang,

674
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,180
you are not the decision-maker.

675
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:09,990
Dear all villagers,

676
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,900
you are the decision-makers.

677
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:13,990
Anybody who signs the contract today

678
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:15,660
will enjoy discounts

679
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,620
to buy a property

680
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,200
from Senwell.

681
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:24,040
I will sign it!

682
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,410
Donglu,

683
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,010
don’t sign it!

684
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:29,150
Mr. Tang,

685
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:30,600
I’m not so silly to refuse money.

686
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:32,370
How much are those dilapidated properties worth?

687
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,870
It is a windfall indeed.

688
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:36,560
Let go of me.

689
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:42,970
He really signed it.

690
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:46,840
Thanks!

691
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:49,000
Thanks so much!

692
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,860
Real money!

693
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:57,260
Triple the standard compensations!

694
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,210
Tonghao,

695
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:12,890
hurry up.

696
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:14,130
Tie it up.

697
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:19,660
Qianyu,

698
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,010
what are you doing?

699
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:22,300
Senwell plans to dismantle Guanmei.

700
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,730
I will resist them to the end.

701
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:25,540
Tonghao,

702
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,370
what are you busy with?

703
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:27,810
Tie it up. Or it will be too late.

704
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:29,120
Senwell has prepared for it.

705
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,850
We must find a countermeasure.

706
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,130
What is that?

707
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,120
White dolphin?

708
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,820
I have prepared the diving suit.

709
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,910
Let’s go now.

710
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:45,720
You had the same idea.

711
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,380
What on earth are you talking about?

712
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:48,280
Let’s go.

713
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:50,560
Let’s go.

714
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:53,350
Oh.

715
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:56,160
Folks, don’t sign the contract.

716
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,610
Don’t sign the contract.

717
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:58,350
Dear all,

718
00:36:58,830 --> 00:36:59,870
don’t sign the contract.

719
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,100
Dear all folks,

720
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,370
we are not selling properties.

721
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,570
It is our home that our ancestors

722
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:09,430
have operated and maintained with their life.

723
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:14,280
Without the home,

724
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:17,900
we will all become homeless roamers.

725
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,960
Butterball,

726
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,880
I can repay all my debts

727
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:25,000
with so much money.

728
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:32,240
Mr. Tang,

729
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:36,530
you are no longer the owner of Guanmei Inn,

730
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,530
nor can you represent the villagers.

731
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:40,270
Please don’t be a troublemaker.

732
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,350
You are not just hampering
the progress of Senwell’s project,

733
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:44,090
but undermining the villagers’ benefits.

734
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,390
They can live a better life

735
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:49,270
with the money, right?

736
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,230
Yes.

737
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,180
Don’t be so stubborn.

738
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,370
It is good for nobody.

739
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:56,890
Let’s get the money together

740
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:59,300
and it is good for all.

741
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,130
Yes.

742
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,200
Exactly.

743
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:01,850
Tang Shunming,

744
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:03,530
stop undermining our interests.

745
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:04,890
Your inn is about to collapse

746
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:06,010
and it is useless at all.

747
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,450
We can buy a big apartment in the downtown
with the compensations

748
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:09,840
and it is a good deal.

749
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:10,890
Yes.

750
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:12,370
It is good to sign the contract.

751
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:13,470
Take a second thought.

752
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:14,640
Yes.

753
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:27,570
Stop it!

754
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:28,680
What are you going to do?

755
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:34,330
Mr. Tang.

756
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:41,350
If you want to dismantle my Guanmei Inn,

757
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:43,690
just run over my body first.

758
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:44,340
Mr. Tang.

759
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,350
Mr. Tang.

760
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,890
What a stubborn butterball!

761
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:49,740
Just give up Guanmei Inn.

762
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,690
You don’t have to risk your own life.

763
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,030
Without Guanmei,

764
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:56,330
my family’s business
developed in three generations

765
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:58,330
will be completely destroyed.

766
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:01,430
What is the point of my survival?

767
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:02,150
Mr. Tang,

768
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,630
you have threatened us

769
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:05,860
with your suicide once.

770
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,530
It is too stupid to play this game.

771
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:10,740
Please don’t waste our time.

772
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:13,250
Folks!

773
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:15,220
Sign the contract and get the money right away.

774
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,510
Go and sign it!

775
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:17,680
Yes.

776
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:19,840
What are you doing?

777
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,420
Don’t sign it!

778
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,280
Don’t sign it!

779
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,710
Stop! Don’t sign it! Listen to me!

780
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,120
Don’t sign it! Don’t sign it!

781
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,150
Don’t sign it!

782
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,470
Qianyu, come here right away! Big troubles!

783
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,770
Butterball is besieged and attacked.

784
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:53,760
Delay it?

785
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:06,760
It is here!

786
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:43,230
Qianyu,

787
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,650
take care!

788
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,540
Please take care!

789
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:01,630
Let’s go.

790
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:02,400
OK.

791
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:11,170
Don’t sign it!

792
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:14,090
Calm down!

793
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:15,220
Don’t sign it!

794
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:18,330
Don’t sign it!

795
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:19,360
No more jostle!

796
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:21,590
Don’t come here!

797
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:23,430
Listen,

798
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:24,370
don’t come any further!

799
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:26,730
I have heart diseases.

800
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:28,780
Anybody who comes over and knocks me down

801
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,020
will have to take the responsibility.

802
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:35,080
Forget him. He is a liar.

803
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:37,130
Delay it?

804
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:38,520
No more jostle!

805
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,120
Calm down.

806
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,250
Tang Shunming,

807
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:45,680
give me the contract.

808
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:46,270
No.

809
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:47,390
Give me!

810
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:48,800
No.

811
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:49,770
Give me.

812
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:50,730
I will tear it.

813
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:51,580
You won’t have the courage.

814
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:53,170
I will show you the courage!

815
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:54,600
I challenge you to do that. You are a coward!

816
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:56,290
I am a real coward if I don’t tear it!

817
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,170
You are a coward
because you won’t have the courage!

818
00:41:58,190 --> 00:41:59,950
I… I will tear it!

819
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,250
I will!

820
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:04,710
Again!

821
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,160
Stop it!

822
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:09,120
Tang Shunming!

823
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,250
Again!

824
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:11,110
Stop it,

825
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:12,600
or I will tear you into pieces!

826
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:13,170
Stop it!

827
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:14,820
No fighting!

828
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:19,300
Why are you…

829
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,050
Get away!

830
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,320
Give it to me!

831
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:22,200
Beat you!

832
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:23,060
