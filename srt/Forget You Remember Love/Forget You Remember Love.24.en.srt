Boss?

14

Dawei, ask Ye Qianyu to come to my office now!

15
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,110
Yes.

16
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:38,880
Junhao.

17
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,000
What’s wrong?

18
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,980
What’s this?

19
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,110
- I’m sorry, my bad. - It’s OK.

20
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,000
I’m sorry.

21
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,600
I’m really sorry.

23
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,960
Mr. Zhao.

24
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,470
Is this yours?

25
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:35,080
It might’ve fallen to my cart this morning.

26
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,270
I thought it might be important

27
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:37,360
and dare not lose it.

28
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,190
Yes. Thanks.

29
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,720
It is mine

30
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,390
but it’s useless.

31
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:58,320
I was about to shred it.

32
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,670
Thank you anyway.

33
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,600
You’re welcome.

34
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,720
See you. Bye.

35
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,550
Ye Qianyu,

36
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,550
Mr. Shan asked to see you.

37
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,030
Me?

38
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,720
Mr. Shan.

39
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,390
Director Fan.

40
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,040
Why did you touch my stuff?

41
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,920
What stuff?

42
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,200
Files on Mr. Shan’s tables

43
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,110
became disordered

44
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,830
and one important page is gone.

45
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,600
I did organize them.

46
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,000
Did you take that page?

47
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,040
I didn’t.

48
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,200
I didn’t take anything.

49
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:56,200
How come it’s gone

50
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,390
after you cleaned my office?

51
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,830
When I turned on the vacuum cleaner,

52
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,390
the blow mode was on,

53
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,110
and the files fell on the floor.

54
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,200
I picked them up and put them back.

55
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:10,040
Could it be left at some corner?

56
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,790
Ye Qianyu,

57
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,720
that page contains classified information.

58
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,950
Think harder.

59
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,670
Did you throw it away?

60
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,440
I swear I didn’t.

61
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,720
When I do the cleaning,

62
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,600
I never throw away any files

63
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,760
unless they are in the shredder.

64
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,390
Otherwise,

65
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:31,110
cleaners have no right to touch them.

66
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:34,880
Get out.

67
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,640
Don’t ever set foot in my office again!

68
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,950
I didn’t take anything...

69
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,110
It wasn’t me...

70
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:46,350
Dawei.

71
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,440
Tell Director Xu

72
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,830
to send me another copy.

73
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,200
Yes, boss.

74
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:12,350
Nobody is allowed to touch

75
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,670
Mr. Shan’s table.

76
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,270
You don’t know that?

77
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,760
Ada told it to me.

78
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,830
I swear I only picked them up.

79
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,790
That includes our top secret.

80
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,040
If it leaks out,

81
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,230
we’re doomed.

82
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,230
I’ll look for it again.

83
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,760
Qianyu.

84
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:55,880
What are you doing here?

85
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,790
I was waiting for you downstairs for a while.

86
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,510
You didn’t pick up your phone.

87
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,160
Why are you in a cleaner’s uniform?

88
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:12,550
Because... Because I am a cleaner.

89
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,480
Cleaner?

90
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,880
I asked you to learn
in the Administration Department,

91
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,640
not to do the dusting.

92
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:23,830
It’s OK.

93
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:26,110
Starting from the bottom isn’t bad.

94
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,110
Besides, I’m inexperienced.

95
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,920
I have so much to learn.

96
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,390
Why didn’t you tell me yesterday?

97
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,640
I didn’t want to worry you.

98
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,670
I can’t always

99
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,760
hide under your wing in Senwell.

100
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,230
Alright.

101
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,640
Let’s go home.

102
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,950
We can’t.

103
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,230
Why?

104
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,480
I made a huge mistake.

105
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,600
You did?

106
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,830
What did you do wrong?

107
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,040
I lost a classified file

108
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,390
when cleaning Mr. Shan’s office.

109
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,480
Don’t panic.

110
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,600
I’ll help you find it.

111
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,440
Junhao.

112
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,640
What will you do to Ye Qianyu?

113
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:18,340
Dawei.

114
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,160
Ask her to leave tomorrow.

115
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,020
Boss,

116
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:24,270
are you firing her?

117
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,640
Taichu brought her here after all.

118
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,790
Since she works in Senwell,

119
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,520
she must follow our rules.

120
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,030
Let her be Taichu’s assistant then.

121
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,710
She’ll be his problem.

122
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,880
I don’t want to see her again.

123
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,640
Lighten up, Junhao, don’t be mad.

124
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,520
Cheer up.

125
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:49,640
I picked

126
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,440
a few decoration plans for our wedding.

127
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,200
Have a look.

128
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,150
Do you like this one?

129
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:01,550
It’s all up to you.

130
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,150
Still haven’t found it.

131
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,200
Shan Junhao is right.

132
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,880
I am a disaster.

133
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:18,910
Hey, don’t beat yourself up.

134
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,080
It’s already late.

135
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:21,400
Let me drive you back.

136
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,030
Go get changed.

137
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,230
I’ll wait for you outside.

138
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,740
= Janitor’s Room =

139
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,440
Ye Qianyu.

140
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:43,520
Ada.

141
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,080
I knew you wouldn’t be here for too long,

142
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,400
but I didn’t expect

143
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,910
you couldn’t even pass the third day.

144
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:51,960
What do you mean?

145
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,320
What on earth did you do

146
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,440
that infuriated Mr. Shan?

147
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,520
His assistant told me in person

148
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,230
that you made a drastic mistake at work,

149
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,280
so you’re fired.

150
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,150
Go fill in the paperwork in HR.

151
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,440
I’m so useless.

152
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,550
Don’t say that.

153
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,960
But I’m already fired.

154
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,470
Senwell has no right to fire you.

155
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,000
You’re my assistant.

156
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:44,880
Where did that file go?

157
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:48,030
I’ve acquired important information.

158
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,440
Senwell will take further actions

159
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,910
against Marv.

160
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,230
Also,

161
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,640
I happened to get hold of a classified file.

162
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,710
He...

163
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:08,110
No.

164
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,080
I can’t give it to you

165
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,280
unless...

166
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,280
You give me something in return.

167
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:25,400
What’s wrong, Taichu?

168
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:26,980
Qianyu.

169
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,910
Did you give a file to Zhao Qun yesterday?

170
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:29,910
Yes.

171
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,030
It fell in my cart by accident.

172
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,110
Did you see

173
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,080
what was it about?

174
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,640
No. I didn’t understand a word on it.

175
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:40,590
Zhao Qun is most likely a spy.

176
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,880
A spy?

177
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:44,960
How could he be?

178
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,910
He’s a nice person.

179
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:48,320
The biggest reason to be a spy is money.

180
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,030
Some people may seem nice,

181
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,960
but they have no principles.

182
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,150
Let’s tell Shan Junhao about it now.

183
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:55,880
We can’t.

184
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,350
We have no proof.

185
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,660
Where can we get it?

186
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,440
I have an idea.

187
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,200
What is this about?

188
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:17,980
Have a seat.

189
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,000
Just cut to the chase.

190
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,910
I’m sure you didn’t invite me here for drinks.

191
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,150
Most senior executives of the key departments

192
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,760
are your people.

193
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,110
You also took over

194
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,470
all my previous projects.

195
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,590
You’ve gradually weakened Shan Junhao’s power.

196
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,400
What’s your next move?

197
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:50,030
Shan Junhao just lost a classified file

198
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,000
about competitive strategies against Marv.

199
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,030
Shan Junhao

200
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:00,520
made such a stupid mistake.

201
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,590
If our trade secret leaks out under his watch,

202
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,640
the board will surely hold him responsible.

203
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,470
Just sit and watch.

204
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,640
OK.

205
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,730
I’ll send the file to you later.

206
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:14,340
OK, it’s on your desk.

207
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,670
Sure. Of course.

208
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:17,440
No problem. You can trust me.

209
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:18,710
OK. Bye.

210
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:21,820
One cappuccino, please. Thanks.

211
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,360
Got it.

212
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:26,840
I’m in a hurry.

213
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,470
I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry.

214
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,710
I’m sorry, my bad. It’s my fault.

215
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,230
- It’s OK. - Sorry.

216
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:45,180
I’m so very sorry.

217
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,140
- Don’t worry about it. - Let me wash it for you.

218
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:48,040
- Allow me. - No need.

219
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:48,980
- No need, no need. - Let me do it.

220
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:49,750
Thank you.

221
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,520
It’s fine. No big deal.

222
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,520
I’m really sorry.

223
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,230
Ye Qianyu?

224
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:07,790
Why are you still here?

225
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:09,400
Ada.

226
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,110
Let me finish my work for today.

227
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,910
Whatever you do

228
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,550
won’t change anything.

229
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,500
Maybe not.

230
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,620
This article is pretty good.

231
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,890
OK. Well,

232
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:22,150
let’s talk to them

233
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,640
about the issues we came up.

234
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,580
= GQ Group Consultant =

235
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,550
What’s taking her so long?

236
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,080
I charge by the minute.

237
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:36,590
You got it?

238
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,520
This is the first time

239
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,710
I’ve been a thief.

240
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,350
I was scared to death.

241
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,400
01.

242
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:55,760
Who is she?

243
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,520
She’s an IT specialist, 01.

244
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,520
Will this work?

245
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,230
She’s good. Don’t worry.

246
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,200
Taichu,

247
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,790
how come you have all sorts of friends?

248
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:24,030
We went to the same junior high.

249
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,230
Give me your phones.

250
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,880
OK. All done.

251
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:44,840
This guy’s phone

252
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,590
has been bugged.

253
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,960
You can monitor real-time calls

254
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,910
from your own phones now.

255
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,520
Impressive!

256
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:51,760
The owner of the phone

257
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,640
contacts that number about twice a month.

258
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,840
All the call and email records

259
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,150
have been sent to your phones.

260
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:59,550
Thanks, 01.

261
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,140
No big deal.

262
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:03,840
Don’t forget to pay me.

263
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,000
I won’t.

264
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:07,780
Hey,

265
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,200
a piece of free info for you.

266
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:10,550
I knew

267
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:11,520
that company Marv.

268
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,960
They laundry money for others frequently.

269
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,280
Money laundry!

270
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,030
Bye.

271
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,240
- Sure. Bye. - Bye-bye.

272
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,880
I’ll go return his phone.

273
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:32,880
Be careful.

274
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:34,840
No problem.

275
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,350
Did you see my phone?

276
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:52,880
Hello.

277
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,200
No, I didn’t.

278
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,960
Mr. Zhao. What are you looking for?

279
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,350
Did you see my phone?

280
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:06,310
I happened to find one just now.

281
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,950
Is this yours?

282
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:15,040
It... It was on the table, unattended,

283
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,280
so I put it away.

284
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:17,440
Is it yours?

285
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:19,180
Yes.

286
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,060
Thank you.

287
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,700
You’re welcome.

288
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,110
Don’t lose it again.

289
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,800
How did it go?

290
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,230
Nailed it.

291
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,350
What are you reading?

292
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,680
So many words and numbers.

293
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,190
Looks like Zhao Qun

294
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:52,640
has sold Senwell’s information to Marv

295
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,400
more than once.

296
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,640
We must stop him now.

297
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,800
No.

298
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,880
We need to find the missing file first.

299
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,160
Where did he hide it?

300
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:08,280
We can’t search for it openly.

301
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,040
But we can’t let him give it to the buyer,

302
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,070
or Shan Junhao will kill me.

303
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,430
Relax.

304
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,310
I’m here. No one can touch you.

305
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,830
Thank you, Taichu.

306
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,400
Without you,

307
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,110
I wouldn’t know what to do.

308
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,190
Actually, Shan Junhao should thank you

309
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:26,830
for taking that file away by accident.

310
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:27,710
Why?

311
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,070
Hadn’t you done that,

312
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,520
Zhao Qun’s identity

313
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,590
wouldn’t have been exposed.

314
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,400
You’re right.

315
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,220
A new restaurant is nearby.

316
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,910
- It’s great. - They just fixed the time.

317
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,080
Mr. Zhang. Should I drive you home?

318
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:47,930
It’s delicious.

319
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,870
- OK. - Steak is my favorite.

320
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,680
What should we do? Zhao Qun is leaving.

321
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,800
Calm down.

322
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,950
If he’s going to meet with people of Marv,

323
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:55,830
we’ll know it instantly.

324
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,520
He betrayed Senwell!

325
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,680
I’m gonna catch him in the act!

326
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,180
= Chen Calling =

327
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,400
Hello, Chen?

328
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:16,310
Qianyu.

329
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:18,040
I’m working overtime.

330
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,680
Don’t forget to have dinner.

331
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:25,590
Got it. Bye.

332
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,410
OK. Bye.

333
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:30,430
Chen,

334
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,590
feed me now, or I’ll die!

335
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,430
Qianyu.

336
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,070
We can go back to my place.

337
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:37,950
It’s not far from here.

338
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,640
We can take actions easily.

339
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,040
Go to your place?

340
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:41,740
Hmm.

341
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,260
Come in.

342
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,070
Your place looks unique.

343
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,700
I bought most of the stuff

344
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,380
during my trips.

345
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,340
So they just piled on.

346
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,920
It’s a bit messy. I hope you don’t mind.

347
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:02,800
Why are strings attached

348
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,640
to some photos?

349
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,800
Each of them

350
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,350
marks the place I’ve been to.

351
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,190
You’ve been to them all?

352
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,160
If you want to join me,

353
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,640
we can travel together.

354
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:24,710
When you were away,

355
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,350
who would look after your plants?

356
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,560
I hired a housekeeper to do the cleaning

357
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,640
and water them regularly.

358
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,380
Qianyu.

359
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,310
Make yourself at home.

360
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,400
I’ll make you a fruit plate.

361
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,190
Thanks.

362
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:51,310
Why hasn’t Marv

363
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:53,040
contacted Zhao Qun?

364
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,680
I guess they’re weighing his condition.

365
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:14,640
Morning.

366
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,070
Morning.

367
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,640
I didn’t know you could cook.

368
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,920
I ate countless meals at your house.

369
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:27,950
This is the least I should do.

370
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,400
Glad you know that.

371
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,070
Where’s my phone?

372
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,190
Zhao Qun only made a few normal calls.

373
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:37,000
Don’t worry. Let’s eat.

374
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,950
That’s a relief.

375
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:53,640
This is the key to my apartment.

376
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:55,680
You can come here anytime.

377
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:00,520
Is that appropriate?

378
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:03,160
How is it inappropriate?

379
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:09,160
See you in an hour.

380
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,920
I’ll text you the address.

381
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,520
Bring the original file

382
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,310
to prove your credibility.

383
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:17,590
Trust me,

384
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:18,590
you won’t be disappointed.

385
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,640
Mr. Shan,

386
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:28,230
I have something urgent to tell you.

387
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,880
Dawei. Why is she still here?

388
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,710
I’ve told her to leave.

389
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:36,160
I swear it’s an emergency.

390
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:38,680
Got no time for you.

391
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,830
Mr. Shan!

392
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:40,590
Qianyu.

393
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:41,680
Don’t make it hard for me.

394
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,710
It’s really important.

395
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,920
Dawei, can you do me a favor?

396
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:48,800
What is it?

397
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,110
Why are we here?

398
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,830
The venue for the meeting is changed.

399
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,160
What’s going on?

400
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,400
I told him to drive you here, Mr. Shan.

401
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,470
It’s necessary for you

402
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:28,070
to see it yourself.

403
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,590
It’s serious.

404
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,830
Trust them.

405
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,350
They’re over there.

406
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,760
Zhao Qun?

407
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:57,880
What exactly do you have?

408
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,520
Senwell’s counter-strategy against Marv.

409
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:03,000
I bet you’re interested in it.

410
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,040
Hope it’s as good as you claim.

411
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:08,230
This file came out

412
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:09,760
from Shan Junhao’s office.

413
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,880
Top secret.

414
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:15,400
Hadn’t it for a careless cleaner,

415
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:16,710
I wouldn’t have gotten it.

416
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,110
Oh, no!

417
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:43,280
Relax.

418
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,710
I’d never let our trade secret get out.

419
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:55,350
Zhao Qun.

420
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,830
What is this?

421
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,230
What’s wrong?

422
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,000
Read it yourself.

423
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:22,760
Dear sir of Marv,

424
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,160
hello. First, I’d like to...

425
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,680
What happened?

426
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,640
Impossible!

427
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,470
Wait!

428
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:35,760
How did this happen?

429
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,920
I switched the file already.

430
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:39,880
Here you are.

431
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,300
= Call Management Information Terminal =

432
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,920
These are emails and calls

433
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,040
between Zhao Qun and Marv.

434
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,560
Obviously,

435
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,800
Zhao Qun has sold

436
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,040
Senwell’s business secrets

437
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,190
to Marv more than once.

438
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,000
Mr. Zhao.

439
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:34,470
I thought you were a good man.

440
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:36,680
You helped me buy coffee and taught me jargon.

441
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:37,470
I never thought

442
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:39,160
you’d do such things.

443
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,640
I’m sorry.

444
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:46,350
Zhang Minghan,

445
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,470
what do you have to say?

446
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,680
I’ll send him to security

447
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,680
and call the police.

448
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:58,710
I won’t allow anyone

449
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,430
to damage the company.

450
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:09,040
Let’s go.

451
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,640
Mr. Zhang’s man

452
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:22,350
did more damage than good.

453
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,710
Mr. Shan,

454
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:26,280
I managed to right my wrong in time.

455
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:28,830
Can I keep my job?

456
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,040
Ye Qianyu should be promoted.

457
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,230
Without her,

458
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,340
who knows how much confidential info

459
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,040
would be divulged?

460
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:36,880
Thank you, Director Xu,

461
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:38,460
but,

462
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:40,520
I prefer to continue working in Administration.

463
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,560
After days of doing the cleaning,

464
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,590
I’ve noticed that Senwell’s vision

465
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:46,560
is reflected in tons of details.

466
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,920
That’s something I didn’t pay attention to before.

467
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:51,830
I want to do my current job well,

468
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,800
because doing every easy work well

469
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:54,710
isn’t easy at all.

470
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:57,380
Fine.

471
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:00,000
As long as you stay out of my office.

472
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,160
Yes, Mr. Shan.

473
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,710
Alright. Dismissed.

474
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,160
By the way,

475
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,430
I dry-cleaned your shirt

476
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:18,310
and brought it back yesterday.

477
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,280
I forgot to tell you that.

478
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,560
I’ve gotten rid of it.

479
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,310
I never wear second-hand clothes.

480
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,630
Oh.

481
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:39,920
You can call me James Qianyu.

482
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:43,390
- To 007! - To Ye Qianyu!

483
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:45,280
- Cheers! - Cheers!

484
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:48,980
- Dig in. - Let’s eat.

485
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,590
Qianyu,

486
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,040
you stayed up last night for work, didn’t you?

487
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,520
I stayed at Taichu’s.

488
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,520
Taichu’s?

489
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:03,590
Your relationship

490
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:05,040
is moving so fast!

491
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,350
Ye Shengzhe!

492
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:07,470
Start eating

493
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:08,880
and stop talking!

494
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,950
If so, Taichu,

495
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:16,590
should we arrange a time

496
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:17,640
for me to meet your parents?

497
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,880
Chen,

498
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:22,070
I only slept there.

499
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:23,400
You slept there?

500
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,070
Am I going to be an uncle soon?

501
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,680
If I can have a grandchild,

502
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,880
that’ll be good.

503
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:39,280
Enough, you two!

504
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:46,920
Fine, fine. We’ll stop.

505
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,350
- Cheers! - Cheers!

506
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:50,640
Cheers!

507
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:54,510
Cheers!

508
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:55,190
- Congratulations! - Bottoms up!

509
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,800
Junhao,

510
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,640
it’s been a while since you came back.

511
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,950
The wedding date has been settled,

512
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:22,830
and the preparation is almost finished.

513
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:27,430
I think it’s time to make it public.

514
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:35,040
Such a message is also good for the company.

515
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:36,680
After all, a happily-married

516
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,560
and family-supported entrepreneur

517
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,560
is more trustworthy in the eyes of others.

518
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:43,190
What do you guys think?

519
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,280
OK.

520
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,470
Junhao,

521
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:06,560
Mrs. Lin cooked your favorite food.

522
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:19,870
What’s wrong?

523
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,320
Nothing.

524
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,040
Let’s eat.

525
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:33,600
- Let’s go to the cinema after work.
- Leave the proposal as it is.

526
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,990
There are new movies.

527
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,960
- I think… - I have an appointment tonight.

528
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,840
- Let’s take a rain check. - OK, great.

529
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,010
- We can watch them together. - Sure.

530
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,560
- OK, it’s a deal. - It’s a deal.

531
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,000
OK.

532
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,430
- Morning, boss. - Morning, boss.

533
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:56,520
Morning, boss.

534
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:04,520
Did you read the proposal I sent you last night?

535
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:06,750
- I did. I think it’s well-written.
- Do you want a cup of coffee?

536
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:07,580
OK.

537
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,470
OK, Americano for you?

538
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:10,170
Sure. Thanks.

539
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:15,190
We must make such changes

540
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:17,670
to thwart Marv’s plan

541
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:19,950
so that Senwell Hotel

542
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:21,870
can make a complete turnaround.

543
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:26,600
I have another suggestion.

544
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,760
We can ask Focus

545
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,360
to give Mr. Shan an exclusive interview.

546
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,190
Focus is one of the most authoritative media.

547
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,560
Its editor-in-chief Xie Quan

548
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,190
is a well-known figure.

549
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,150
If he can speak for us,

550
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,520
it’ll boost

551
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,710
the awareness of our hotel.

552
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,280
Director Fan.

553
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:47,840
Director Fan?

554
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:51,080
Director Fan?

555
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:53,800
Any suggestions?

556
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:57,800
But...

557
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,520
Mr. Shan never takes interviews.

558
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,520
Since Mr. Shan

559
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,950
has never been under the spotlight,

560
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:05,120
this sudden appearance

561
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:07,190
will create an unprecedented effect on publicity.

562
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:10,710
I agree with Director Xu.

563
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:14,910
The public has always been curious about Mr. Shan.

564
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,630
If he can take this interview,

565
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,320
its effect will be bigger

566
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,600
than star-studded ads.

567
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,040
I think

568
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:31,950
we can have a try.

569
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,560
- Mr. Shan agreed? - Yeah!

570
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:54,600
Just to be sure,

571
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:56,760
are you thinking what I’m thinking?

572
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,190
Which is?

573
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,230
Xie Quan is influential

574
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:04,040
but he’s also famous for his acrimony.

575
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:05,800
I bet he’ll be harsh

576
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,950
on Shan Junhao.

577
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,800
If he’s publicly humiliated,

578
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,280
the board will have the excuse to impeach him.

579
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:16,560
Don’t get too excited.

580
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,390
Let’s see what will happen next.

581
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:21,560
Director Fan.

582
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:22,820
Double-check this file.

583
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:23,720
One coffee, please.

584
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,570
- Got it. - No mistake is allowed.

585
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:26,180
This client has insanely high standards.

586
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:26,950
I see.

587
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,070
Qianyu.

588
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,720
Director Fan.

589
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,520
Qianyu.

590
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,080
Why do you want to work in Senwell?

591
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:51,320
To learn of course.

592
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,760
I have so much to learn

593
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,190
from such a conglomerate.

594
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:56,670
Taichu once said,

595
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:58,320
“being with the better

596
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,190
to be better”.

597
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:02,000
Only by improving my expertise

598
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,950
will I be able to run Guanmei Inn well.

599
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:06,360
If you want to take your inn

600
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,910
to the next level,

601
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:10,560
Senwell Hotel is a better platform for you.

602
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,760
Senwell Hotel

603
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,520
is a globally-recognized five-star hotel chain,

604
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,430
equipped with a world-class management system.

605
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:19,580
Can I work there?

606
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,710
The biggest cause of Guanmei Inn’s loss

607
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:24,950
is a lack of professional management.

608
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:26,360
I’m always eager to get in-depth knowledge

609
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,950
about Senwell Hotel’s vision and business mode.

610
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,910
Although our inn

611
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:32,840
is different from a hotel,

612
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:34,040
many principles

613
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,560
can still be applied.

614
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,230
If you want to work there,

615
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:38,470
I can arrange it.

616
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,390
Really?

617
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:42,390
That’d be great!

618
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:43,600
Thank you, Director Fan.

619
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,280
You’re welcome.

620
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:47,670
Director Fan. Your coffee.

621
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,150
Thanks.

622
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,910
See you.

623
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,190
Shan Junhao,

624
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:22,840
can you be less serious?

625
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,760
Don’t always frown.

626
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,630
When you do that, people get scared

627
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,150
and run away from you.

628
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:29,950
Cheer up, OK?

629
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,430
Boss?

630
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:05,360
My office

631
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:07,150
needs to be cleaned.

632
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:07,910
Yes, boss.

633
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:51,870
Come in.

634
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:54,910
Mr. Shan.

635
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,190
I spilt water on the floor.

636
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:03,840
Please mop it.

637
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:04,910
Yes, Mr. Shan.

638
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:24,080
It’s done, sir.

639
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,320
Wait.

640
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,230
Is it your turn

641
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:32,840
to clean my office today?

642
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,000
Yes. We work in shifts.

643
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:41,560
You may leave.

644
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,520
Yes, Mr. Shan.

645
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:58,150
Come in.

646
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:02,390
Mr. Shan.

647
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,150
Boss,

648
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,520
Taichu is here to check with you

649
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,320
about the center island planning of Guanmei.

650
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:12,430
OK. Have a seat.

651
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:13,360
Thanks.

652
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:18,470
Dawei. Please bring us some coffee.

653
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:19,630
OK.

654
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,020
Mr. Shan.

655
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,320
I learned that

656
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,950
according to the proposal,

657
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,320
the center island

658
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:29,390
is designed to be a villa resort, correct?

659
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:30,700
Yes.

660
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:32,710
Is there a problem?

661
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,040
Problem is

662
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,950
that island is also known as the Dolphin Island.

663
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,190
Qianyu and I have been there.

664
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,320
Waters around there

665
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,190
used to be Chinese white dolphins’ habitats.

666
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:43,630
She also told me stories about them.

667
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:52,120
So?

668
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,280
If we can make it

669
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,780
a dolphin museum or a dolphin park,

670
00:42:59,140 --> 00:42:59,940
that’ll be better.

671
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,040
Have you calculated the financial return?

672
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,080
The proposal

673
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,950
already includes ocean view hotels,

674
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:07,840
residences and seafood restaurants.

675
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,760
An extra villa resort is unnecessary.

676
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:11,520
If we can turn that area

677
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,710
into a theme park like Disneyland,

678
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,840
I believe it’ll attract more families to come

679
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,190
and it’ll expand the customer base,

680
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:18,800
yielding more returns.

681
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:23,040
I’m not rejecting your plan

682
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,870
but I need more statistics and comparisons.

683
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:26,940
No problem.

684
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:28,390
I’ll go back to work then.

685
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:29,900
OK.

686
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:37,430
Mr. Shan.

687
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:40,360
You and Director Fan will soon get married, right?

688
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:41,540
Congratulations.

689
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:46,280
Don’t forget to invite me.

690
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,630
Qianyu and I will give you a big red envelope.

691
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:58,460
Thanks.

692
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,120
You know what?

693
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:09,840
Boss and Director Fan will soon get married.

694
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:11,520
What a lovely couple!

695
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:12,800
Hello, Director Fan.

696
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,280
Congratulations, Director!

697
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:15,370
Thanks.

698
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:17,390
It’s Mrs. Shan.

699
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:19,150
Yes, sorry, Mrs. Shan.

700
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:20,840
Go back to work.

701
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:21,600
- Yes. - Yes.

702
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,250
- I’m so envious! - I know.

703
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:25,580
- She’s so lucky. - Yunyi.

704
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:26,640
Have a look.

705
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,470
What’s up, Ziqian?

706
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,490
- Get the minutes ready. - Yes.

707
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:31,840
You got a minute?

708
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:40,600
Yunyi.

709
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:42,910
Are you sure about the wedding?

710
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:44,840
Ziqian.

711
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:46,470
What’s your point?

712
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,390
Marital choice concerns your lifetime happiness.

713
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:53,360
I hope you’ll walk down that aisle with joy.

714
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,000
If you have even the slightest bit of doubt,

715
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,360
you should reconsider it.

716
00:44:57,910 --> 00:44:59,000
Ziqian.

717
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,560
I have no doubt.

718
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:05,000
Junhao loved Qianyu when he was memoryless.

719
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:07,230
That doesn’t bother you at all?

720
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:11,280
He lost his memory,

721
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:12,870
so he did things

722
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:14,520
that he wouldn’t normally do.

723
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:16,000
You really believe

724
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,760
he has no feelings for her?

725
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:23,000
I know

726
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:24,870
you don’t.

727
00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:27,230
You’ve always been like a princess

728
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:28,600
but Ye Qianyu

729
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:29,800
impaired your confidence.

730
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,320
If a marriage starts with concerns

731
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:35,000
and suspicions,

732
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:37,910
how will that be happy?

733
00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:42,000
Since I opened my eyes

734
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,230
and saw Junhao at six,

735
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:47,470
he’s become my dream.

736
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:49,760
I’ve never thought about leaving him.

737
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:52,120
Our decade-long relationship

738
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,320
is much stronger than his fling

739
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,390
with Ye Qianyu.

740
00:45:56,710 --> 00:45:58,600
Besides, I met Junhao

741
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,600
way before she did.

742
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:03,360
Love isn’t first-come-first-served.

743
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,190
Memory can be deceptive.

744
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:08,040
What you two have

745
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,190
might be a family bond

746
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,630
instead of love.

747
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,280
I don’t want to hear it.

748
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,390
I won’t change

749
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:20,670
my decision.

750
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:21,670
Yunyi.

751
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:24,950
You have high expectations for love.

752
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:26,840
You can pretend for a while

753
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:29,120
but not forever.

754
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,520
The thorn, if not removed quickly,

755
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:33,190
will only grow deeper.

756
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:36,430
I don’t want you to regret it.

757
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:37,800
Ziqian.

758
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,120
Thank you for your consideration.

759
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,000
