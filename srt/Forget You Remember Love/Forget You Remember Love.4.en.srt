Otherwise there would be an uproar.

Where has Junhao been?

Aunt Jiang, Uncle Shan,

don’t feel too stressful.

16

I’ve contacted the police.

17

Hello, Officer Liu.

18
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,180
What?

19
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:26,670
OK.

20
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,380
I see.

21
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:32,500
Ziqian.

22
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,040
What’s happened?

23
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,970
What did Officer Liu say?

24
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,260
Someone saw

25
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:43,050
Junhao’s car

26
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,250
drove into the sea

27
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,580
to dodge a truck.

28
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,360
Where is Junhao?

29
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,560
The police are salvaging.

30
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,420
No news till now.

Anything over there?

36
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:31,560
Nothing from here.

37
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,440
Watch your steps!

38
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:34,990
Look closer!

39
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,600
Chen,

40
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,160
you’re so generous today.

41
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,630
You treated us buffet.

42
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:56,520
It’s Shengzhe’s first show.

43
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,490
Of course we should celebrate it.

44
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,050
By the way,

45
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,620
give me an advance notice next time.

46
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,270
If I’d been starving for a day,

47
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,120
I’d make the boss breaks the bank.

48
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:07,810
However, Chen,

49
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,900
you ate for 2 hours

50
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,650
and never drank a drop of water.

51
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,130
I respect that.

52
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,080
You’re awesome!

53
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,280
Come on. What’s your trick?

54
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,290
Man ahead!

55
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,370
Man ahead!

56
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,340
Get off.

57
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:13,940
What…

58
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:17,650
What should we do?

59
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,850
It’s him!

60
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:27,820
Who?

61
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,150
What now?

62
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,140
Touch his neck with your hand.

63
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,490
What for?

64
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,980
There should have pulse on the neck.

65
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,130
Check his right chin

66
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,120
if it’s bumping.

67
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:41,960
Right.

68
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,020
Go ahead.

69
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:45,400
Go! Come on.

70
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,120
Hurry.

71
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,300
I dare not to.

72
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,720
I think he has pulse.

73
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:17,950
I’m scared.

74
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:19,690
Let’s send him to the hospital.

75
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:20,920
Right.

76
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:33,910
What are you doing?

77
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,760
Li Donglu, you frightened us!

78
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,570
The car broke down?

79
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,660
No.

80
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,340
We’re going home.

81
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:48,800
Shengzhe went to the toilet.

82
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:49,800
Yes.

83
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,330
What’s that?

84
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,150
It looks like a foot.

85
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:58,560
Foot?

86
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,680
That is a prop for Shengzhe’s show today,

87
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,270
a doll.

88
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:06,430
Prop?

89
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,770
It’s so real.

90
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,780
Good workmanship!

91
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,100
Prop.

92
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,120
Well,

93
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:15,800
Donglu,

94
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:17,050
um…

95
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,450
You must be tired

96
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:19,460
after the nightshift patrol.

97
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,030
Go home now!

98
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,130
Yes, it’s tiresome.

99
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,250
Jinzhi,

100
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,450
are you caring about me?

101
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:28,800
Jinzhi,

102
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,080
well, I… I’m going…

103
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,420
I’m going to your grocery

104
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,830
and buy lots of stuff.

105
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,510
Donglu,

106
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:40,240
well, what… What do you need?

107
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,300
What’s so urgent? Well.

108
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,500
Qianyu can deliver it to you tomorrow.

109
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,600
I’ll go. I’ll deliver it.

110
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,210
It’s OK. There’s no need.

111
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,890
Your grocery is on my way home.

112
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,380
I’m going to buy stuff now. No need for delivery.

113
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,520
I can buy stuff at any time.

114
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:55,980
Wait, hey!

115
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,970
I’ll take the lead. You guys follow me.

116
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,090
Keep close.

117
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:03,890
Follow my lead.

118

Follow me.

119
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,020
What should I do? I’m afraid.

120
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,730
Goodness!

121
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,820
What now?

122
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:15,080
Calm down.

123
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,320
We can do it.

124
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:17,240
Stay calm.

125
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:17,690
It’ll be OK.

126
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:18,530
Easy. Calm down.

127
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,170

128
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:19,740
Go.

129
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,030
OK.

130
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,430
Keep up.

Done what?

146
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:05,770
You walked me out, Jinzhi.

147
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,900
I’m so touched. I feel so warm.

148
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,640

I don’t think

168
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,270
we should send him to the hospital.

169
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,870
We can’t afford the medical bills.

170
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,640
The car isn’t insured.

171
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,500
But we can’t leave him here to die.

172
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,360
Let’s drop him outside the hospital.

173
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,840
The doctors will take him in.

174
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,080
Then we’ll be clean.

175

Anyway, let’s send him over.

feel uncomfortable?

00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:57,440
in Guanmei Fishing Village?

197
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,240
I don’t know.

198
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,660
What’s your name?

199
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,290
I can’t remember my name.

200
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:28,510
You stay here.

201
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:30,630
I’ll get some clean clothes.

202
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,600
You’ll get cold in wet ones.

203
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,750
Right.

204
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:39,330
I’ll help them with it.

205
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,750
Go up. Up!

206
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:47,320
Watch out.

207
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:00,100
Does he turn dumb due to the collision?

208
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,800
He doesn’t remember anything.

209
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,350
Is it memory loss?

210
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:06,860
Anyway,

211
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,060
don’t tell him we hit him.

212
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:12,550
It’s better that he couldn’t remember.

213
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:13,790
Should we take him

214
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:16,750
to the hospital for an examination?

215
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,580
He’s already awake.

216
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,720
We couldn’t drop him

217
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,410
outside of the hospital
without anybody knowing it.

218
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,480
We can’t go.

219
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:56,960
The ring on your finger looks weird.

220
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:58,730
How so?

221
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,750
I think I saw it somewhere.

222
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,430
But I couldn’t remember it.

223
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,590
This ring is mine.

224
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,470
It has nothing to do with you.

225
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:10,730
Oh.

226
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:17,870
Where do you get this watch?

227
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,930
It looks expensive.

228
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,390
No idea.

229
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,920
Wow!

230
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,240
This is Patek Philippe worth 2 million!

231
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,550
How… How much?

232
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:40,720
You heard it right. 2 million.

233
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,820
His must be false.

234
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,590
Does he look like a man who can afford it?

235
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:53,680
He wrote me an IOU.

236
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,230
You forgot it?

237
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:58,470
I really don’t remember anything.

238
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,910
Do you know me?

239
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,430
Can you tell me

240
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,700
who I am?

241
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,340
You? You’re a liar!

242
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,610
A liar?

243
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:19,510
You don’t believe it?

244
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:22,640
Look at it.

245
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,310
= IOU Debtor: Tonghao =
You wrote this IOU to me.

246
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,940
Because of you, I lost the reward.

247
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,130
However, I saved you

248
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,140
and dressed you up.

249
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:31,010
But you refused to pay me back.

250
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:33,450
Even the phone number is wrong.

251
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:38,570
Do you have pen and paper?

252
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:48,960
Thank you.

253
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,240
It seems I did write it.

254
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,980
So my name is Tonghao.

255
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,460
Yes.

256
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,940
How did I get here?

257
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,930
You passed out by the road.

258
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:19,860
We saw you

259
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,830
and took you back on good intention.

260
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:27,770
Thank you very much.

261
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,080
You’re welcome.

262
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:32,430
Don’t mention it.

263
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,720
We’re glad to help.

264
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:38,540
Well, where is the police station?

265
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,380
Why do you want to go to the police station?

266
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,760
I can find out who I am in the police station.

267
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,370
You can’t go to the station!

268
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:48,040
Why?

269
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:51,910
Because you…

270
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,780
You’re a liar!

271
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,560
Liar!

272
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,680
You’ll be walking yourself to jail!

273
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,930
To jail!

274
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,660
It’s for your good!

275
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,010
Your good!

276
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,710
Perhaps after a night’s sleep,

277
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:04,830
your memory will come back tomorrow.

278
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,010
You.

279
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,520
Sleep in this room.

280
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:17,890
Tonight, you sleep here.

281
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:20,010
Your room.

282
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:25,460
Good night. Sweet dreams.

283
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,120
Good night.

284
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:38,630
What?

285
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:39,510
What?

286
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:40,410
Chen,

287
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:42,480
how could you let him stay?

288
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:44,010
If we don’t,

289
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,460
he’ll go to the police station.

290
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,410
He couldn’t remember anything anyway.

291
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:49,820
Even he does go to the police,

292
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,470
he won’t turn us in.

293
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,010
What if

294
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,890
he thinks we were running away from the scene,

295
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:00,410
and we took him back to kill him and the evidence?

296
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,870
He could forge the memory loss

297
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,120
and waits for chance to escape.

298
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:05,440
Mom,

299
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,290
you’re so imaginative.

300
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,050
Is it possible?

301
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,350
Then he’s so good at acting.

302
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,050
Let’s watch him for a while.

303
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,500
If he does lose his memory,

304
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:20,730
we’ll let him go.

305
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:24,600
Is it right to do that?

306
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,370
Do you want to go to jail?

307
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,640
Even if no jail, you’ll have to compensate.

308
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,780
Can you afford it?

309
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,140
No.

310
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,010
Go to bed.

311
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,320
Yaolong,

312
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,050
take the medicine.

313
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,500
Later,

314
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,940
you’d better go upstairs and have some rest.

315
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,040
You didn’t close your eyes last night.

316
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:54,580
Your body can’t put up with it.

317
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:56,730
If there’s news,

318
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,520
I’ll let you know.

319
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,580
Junhao is our only son.

320
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,870
Now he’s missing,

321
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,840
who could go to sleep?

322
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,300
Mr. and Mrs. Shan, Miss Yunyi,

323
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,540
breakfast is ready.

324
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,500
Do you want to have some?

325
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,040
Let’s have breakfast.

326
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,870
You go.

327
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:23,360
Have some.

328
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:29,930
Mr. Ziqian.

329
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,070
Ziqian is here.

330
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:34,880
Ziqian.

331
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,040
Ziqian.

332
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,360
What’s the news?

333
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:40,120
What’s happened?

334
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,870
The salvage team searched all night.

335
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,780
They didn’t find Junhao.

336
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,580
Just his car

337
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,130
and these things.

338
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,460
How could this happen?

339
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:05,890
It can’t be true.

340
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,370
Uncle Shan!

341
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:13,610
- Yaolong! - Uncle Shan!

342
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:14,750
- Yaolong! - Dad!

343
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:15,490
Yaolong!

344
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:15,850
Mr. Shan!

345
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:16,930
Call an ambulance!

346
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:17,340
OK.

347
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:17,990
Yaolong!

348
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,810
He’s still here.

349
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,890
It seems he did lose his memory.

350
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:37,540
We didn’t lock the door last night.

351
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:39,900
If he wanted to, he’d be gone now.

352
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:43,050
Maybe he overslept.

353
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,710
Morning!

354
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:02,620
Morning!

355
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,830
These are clothes for you to change.

356
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,050
Get changed and come out for breakfast.

357
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,110
Thank you.

358
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:15,520
See you later.

359
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,660
These are Chen’s specials,
porridge and vegetables.

360
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,520
It’s delicious.

361
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,040
It is!

362
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,140
Do you remember

363
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,800
what happened last night?

364
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,290
Do you remember your name?

365
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:37,860
My name is Tonghao.

366
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,280
Then do you remember

367
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,250
how you came to our home?

368
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,110
I passed out by the road.

369
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:49,130
You guys took me back.

370
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,890
It seems he doesn’t remember anything.

371
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:06,880
The porridge is delicious.

372
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,500
I want another bowl.

373
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,200
You eat like a horse.

374
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:15,620
Go get it yourself if you want another.

375
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:16,740
Help yourself.

376
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,100
Who is he?

377
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,320
He uses me like a servant.

378
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:37,810
And he eats a lot.

379
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,630
You finished?

380
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,850
I’ll help myself.

381
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:30,480
Doctor,

382
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:31,480
how is he?

383
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:34,270
The patient is not in critical danger now.

384
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,860
But avoid any shock in the future.

385
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:39,200
OK.

386
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,480
Thank you, doctor.

387
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,330
Mom, it’s gonna be fine. Take a seat.

388
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,890
Can I play your Rubik’s cube?

389
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,130
Do you know how?

390
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,430
I don’t know.

391
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:13,090
Let me try.

392
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,090
Wow.

393
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:42,560
Wow! Tonghao,

394
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,270
how did you make it?

395
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,370
I don’t know.

396
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:49,240
It seems you’re smart.

397
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,290
Can I take a look at these?

398
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,200
Of course.

399
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,810
Why do you arrange the goods in this way?

400
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,170
Any other way we can arrange it?

401
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:28,130
How did he do it?

402
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,360
Can I arrange it for you?

403
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:39,040
Let me ask my mom.

404
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:48,250
OK, I see.

405
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:50,240
Thank you.

406
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,520
Director Xu, any news from him?

407
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,940
What should we do now?

408
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:04,960
Keep it confidential

409
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:06,800
about Mr. Shan’s missing.

410
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:09,170
The outside can’t know about it.

411
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:12,200
Within the company,

412
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,280
just say he goes abroad for a secret research.

413
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:15,520
OK.

414
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,030
Oh,

415
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,260
Mr. Shan had

416
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,270
an appointment

417
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:20,550
with GQ Ventures in the afternoon.

418
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,540
What about that?

419
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:22,770
I’ll meet them.

420
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,780
Director Xu,

421
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,330
do you think

422
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,660
Mr. Shan is really…

423
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,590
At least I didn’t find Mr. Shan at the scene.

424
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,910
Neither did they find him in nearby water.

425
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,860
So we still have hope.

426
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,010
I believe it too,

427
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:45,130
that Mr. Shan must be alive.

428
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,000
Am I in the wrong store?

429
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,980
Is this my Money Bag Grocery?

430
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,310
I must be dreaming.

431
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:11,090
It’s a little different.

432
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,200
Why do toys and candies change places?

433
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,730
I put toys down there

434
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,690
to make it convenient for children to pick them.

435
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,910
As for the candies, I put them here

436
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:27,590
because all customers pass here

437
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,430
and they’re on the same level with their eyes.

438
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,240
According to consumer psychology,

439
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,720
this location

440
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:35,750
stirs up customers’ desire to purchase.

441
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,700
What did you do in the past?

442
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,100
I have no idea.

443
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,630
Probably a salesman in supermarket.

444
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:50,360
You prove useful for the rice you ate.

445
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:51,720
Mama Jinzhi,

446
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:52,970
can I work here

447
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:54,950
to pay my debt from now on?

448
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,640
I owe you a lot of money, don’t I?

449
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:07,280
I’ll give you full support.

450
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,520
Director Xu, Mr. Li,

451
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,240
why are you in the General Manager’s office?

452
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,050
Mr. Zhang,

453
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,780
you didn’t even knock

454
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,580
before bursting in to GM’s office.

455
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:27,960
Why is that?

456
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:29,810
Director Xu,

457
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,990
where did Shan Junhao go?

458
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,560
I don’t care he blew off his engagement.

459
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:36,990
But he didn’t show up at the meeting

460
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:37,790
with GQ Ventures.

461
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:39,020
That’s not like him.

462
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,220
Mr. Shan is on a secret research abroad.

463
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,050
Secret research?

464
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,220
On which project?

465
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,440
If I told you,

466
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,120
it wouldn’t be a secret, right?

467
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,100
Mr. Shan has his reason to do that.

468
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:53,690
Mr. Zhang,

469
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,930
what are you suspecting?

470
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,930
Mr. Shan misses nothing about Senwell.

471
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:01,290
Would he take off and leave the company behind?

472
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,770
Everything in Senwell

473
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,370
has to be in my control.

474
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:11,150
He flied out without a notice.

475
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:13,700
What should we do about the agreements we signed?

476
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:14,800
I’ll handle them.

477
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:19,810
You will?

478
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,540
You’re just the Director of Operation Department.

479
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,380
Who gives you the right?

480
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,570
From now on,

481
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:28,720
report everything the first time to me.

482
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:31,520
Mr. Zhang,

483
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:33,610
Mr. Shan is away,
but Chairman Shan is still here.

484
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,420
Isn’t the chairman ill?

485
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,260
I heard he’s in ICU.

486
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:42,120
You’re so cold to ask the chairman to work

487
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,320
at such a time.

488
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,050
Even if you want to lead the company,

489
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,560
you need the board’s approval.

490
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,050
Then convoke a board meeting.

491
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,600
You.

492
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:07,290
Mop there.

493
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,550
Don’t you see the stain there?

494
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:10,650
Behind you.

495
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:20,490
Have you never done any chores?

496
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,360
If you work like this,

497
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:24,740
you won’t pay your debt in 10 years.

498
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:35,320
I’m hungry.

499
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:39,480
Finish the work and you can have lunch.

500
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,240
Qianyu,

501
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:49,220
you’re having lunch?

502
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,110
No.

503
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,640
This is his lunch.

504
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,690
I brought it to him.

505
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:03,250
This is…

506
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:08,450
Hi,

507
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,710
I’m Tonghao.

508
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,000
Tonghao?

509
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,380
You.

510
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:15,330
Have lunch first.

511
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:16,330
Mop the floor later.

512
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:28,570
Tonghao is your new employee?

513
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:31,240
Yes.

514
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:36,930
Your grocery looks different today.

515
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,760
Yeah, we rearranged it.

516
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,240
Let’s go to Dolphin Island.

517
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,300
Let me get prepared.

518
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:43,810
Wait a moment.

519
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:44,270
OK.

520
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:26,620
Qianyu,

521
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:28,860
who is that man?

522
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,890
What’s it with you?

523
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,060
Taichu.

524
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:33,930
Mama Jinzhi.

525
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:35,340
You’re here!

526
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:37,130
Can I get you some tea?

527
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,310
It’s OK.

528
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:39,690
Qianyu and I are going out.

529
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:43,840
Oh, that girl!

530
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,200
Let me call her for you.

531
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:46,520
Hold on.

532
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:54,560
What are you doing here?

533
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:56,570
Qianyu,

534
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:58,160
the cabriolet guy is waiting for you downstairs.

535
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,610
Yeah, I’m going out with him.

536
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:02,420
Why don’t you put on some makeup?

537
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:05,080
Do I need to?

538
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,420
Yes.

539
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,730
I think you look pretty this way.

540
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:11,940
You do have judge of beauty.

541
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:12,920
I’m leaving.

542
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:16,700
What do you know?

543
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:23,210
I’m ready.

544
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,440
Let’s get going.

545
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:27,080
We’re gonna leave.

546
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:28,070
Bye-bye.

547
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,410
Drive safe.

548
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,940
Have fun!

549
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:38,170
I wonder where they’ll have the romantic date.

550
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:42,340
I heard they’re going to Dolphin Island.

551
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:44,280
What?

552
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:46,120
Dolphin Island?

553
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:00,590
I think it’s that way.

554
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,760
Let’s head that direction.

555
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:02,560
OK.

556
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:09,110
Qianyu, let me take a photo for you.

557
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,470
OK, give me a sec.

558
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:14,150
It’s done.

559
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:18,140
I… I’m not ready for the pose.

560
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,800
I like it naturally.

561
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,010
Qianyu,

562
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,300
have you found that

563
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,650
we’re the only boat on the sea?

564
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,040
Of course.

565
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:36,640
No even ghost dares to come here.

566
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,210
I can’t believe I’m here.

567
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,640
Why aren’t you afraid?

568
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:40,610
Me?

569
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,540
Didn’t I tell you before?

570
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:45,390
I’m as bold as a lion.

571
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:48,790
Lion.

572
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:54,130
Over there. It must be Dolphin Island.

573
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,630
We should just head that way.

574
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,410
Taichu,

575
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:57,650
hold on tight.

576
00:36:58,070 --> 00:36:58,600
OK.

577
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,060
I think the boat is down.

578
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:51,210
What should we do now?

579
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:00,150
I’m sorry.

580
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,430
I should have checked the boat.

581
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:03,930
And you didn’t see white dolphin.

582
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:12,360
This bottle of water is on me. Drink it.

583
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,010
It’s OK.

584
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,540
You told me before that

585
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,030
the white dolphin was just a legend.

586
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,700
Besides, accident is part of the travel.

587
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:30,240
And I think it’s interesting.

588
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:35,850
We’re far away from Guanmei Fishing Village.

589
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:37,890
I don’t know

590
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,720
when we could paddle the boat back.

591
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:47,720
My phone has no reception.

592
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:48,970
What about yours?

593
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,240
Mine, neither.

594
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,700
What now?

595
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:08,340
I think the sunshine is bright

596
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:09,570
and the sea is beautiful.

597
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,870
We should stop and enjoy.

598
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,820
Right, Bold Lion?

599
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,450
Qianyu!

600
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,050
Qianyu!

601
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,060
Qianyu!

602
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,200
Tonghao!

603
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,800
Tonghao, I’m here.

604
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:37,937
Qianyu!

605
00:39:37,937 --> 00:39:38,580
Tonghao!

606
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,060
Tonghao!

607
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,230
Qianyu!

608
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,410
Over here!

609
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:44,900
Tonghao is coming!

610
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,970
Tonghao, over here!

611
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:50,110
Over here! We’re here!

612
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,470
Qianyu!

613
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:58,070
Tonghao!

614
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,320
