Would you please not make me worry anymore?

Why do you have to settle such a dangerous issue

13
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,660
by yourself?

14
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:48,840
What about you?

15
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,070
You came to work in Senwell

16
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,620
but you didn’t tell me earlier.

17
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,560
I didn’t tell you

18
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,700
because I wanted to get hired on my own ability.

19
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,800
Then other people may think that

20
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,140
we Shan family mistreat you.

21
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,820
I let my fiancée come out to work

22
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,560
as a low-rank manager.

23
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,940
Stop joking.

24
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,550
I’m still mad.

25
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,220
Do you know how dangerous it was?

26
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,570
All right. I’m fine.

27
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,490
It’s gone.

28
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,230
Still hurt?

Shan Junhao!

30
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,120
Mr. Zhang.

31
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,360
What’s so urgent that you forgot to knock?

32
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,360
As Senwell’s General Manager,

33
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,000
you stirred up such a trouble.

34
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,480
How are you going to settle it down?

35
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,200
Yunyi,

36
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:14,790
will you give us a minute?

37
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,830
OK, Mr. Shan.

38
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:25,730
I believe this is something under control.

39
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,740
You think you didn’t call the police
so no one would know?

40
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,940
There are lots of eyes in the company.

41
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,230
If the media and our competitors find out,

42
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,860
what are you going to say to the board?

43
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,180
Mr. Zhang,

44
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:43,180
leave that to me to worry.

45
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:44,610
I heard

46
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,540
the Malaysian project you’re in charge of

47
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,140
makes no progress.

48
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:55,810
Perhaps, you should think about

49
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,040
how to explain it to the board.

52
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:31,610
trust me.

53
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,830
We’ll figure out something.

54
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,940
Well!

55
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,780
No wonder I couldn’t find you anywhere.

56
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,380
Ye Qianyu, where the hell have you been?

57
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,620
Goods to be delivered are piled up to the roof.

58
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,370
I picked Tang up.

59
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,140
Guanmei Hotel…

60
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,000
Hey,

61
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,900
are you crippled

62
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,430
or are you blind?

63
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,230
Tang Shunming, I warn you.

64
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,970
Ye Qianyu is my daughter,

65
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,930
not a free labor to you!

66
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:04,420
All right, Tang.

67
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:04,900
You…

68
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,620
Blabbing old witch!

69
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:08,960
One day, your tongue will rot!

70
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,390
I beg your pardon.

71
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:18,650
Try to say that again!

72
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:19,870
- All right. All right. - I…

73
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,640
Tang is in bad mood.

74
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,530
Tang, we’re going to deliver the goods.

75
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:24,530
Let’s go.

76
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,040
You ungrateful girl!

77
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,650
I feed you and give you a roof on top.

78
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,110
Yet you speak for him!

79
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,060
Good.

80
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:31,700
Why don’t you

81
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,280
ask the stupid fat ass for money?

82
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,800
Chen Jinzhi!

83
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,130
Can’t you say something nice?

84
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,910
Each time when the kid makes a mistake,

85
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,320
you yell at her.

86
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,390
She’s my kid.

87
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,210
None of your business.

88
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:46,980
If you’re so good,

89
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,560
get some of your own kids to yell at.

90
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,140
I…

91
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,130
I’m not so good.

92
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,950
You are. You’re so good at it.

93
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,240
You get knocked up with everybody.

94
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,830
You even got knocked up on a light bulb errand.

95
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:58,970
Tang Shunming!

96
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,360
How many times have I told you?

97
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,900
That I asked him to change a light bulb is all!

98
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,400
We were married for long.

99
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,550
You didn’t get pregnant.

100
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:06,980
You asked a curly hair foreigner

101
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,700
to change a light bulb and you were pregnant?

102
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,880
By the way, Shengzhe’s hair is curly.

103
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,190
Is it just a coincidence?

104
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:13,240
I’ve told you many times.

105
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,540
You just didn’t listen.

106
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,580
Look,

107
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,330
in these years,

108
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:18,270
you couldn’t get over with these trivial things.

109
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:19,100
Let me tell you.

110
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,670
The greatest decision I’ve made in my life

111
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,640
is to divorce you!

112
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,360
What?

113
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,810
Guanmei Hotel is gonna be demolished?

114
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,520
Yes.

115
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,310
So,

116
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,880
do not pick at him anymore.

117
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,100
He doesn’t have to kill himself.

118
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:45,890
Silly butterball,

119
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:47,140
what was in his mind?

120
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:49,130
If he dies,

121
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,220
he loses everything.

122
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,880
Chen,

123
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,100
are you worried about Tang?

124
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:03,240
Why would I be?

125
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,400
Who is him to me?

126
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:08,060
I bust my ass to worry about you.

127
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,760
Do you?

128
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,740
Get the vegetable washed!

129
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,360
Someone is playing my mom’s favorite music

130
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,060
with her piano.

131
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,080
This is your mom’s piano?

132
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:44,610
Ye Qianyu,

133
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,100
how many times have I told you that

134
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,000
this piano belongs to my shop now?

135
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:50,960
Sunshine,

136
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,860
do not buy this piano.

137
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,000
Because it belonged to my late mom.

138
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,380
I was just passing by and trying it out.

139
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,130
Don’t plan to buy it.

140
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,000
Good then. Good.

141
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,670
Passing by?

142
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,770
Sir, is this your first trip to Guanmei?

143
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:13,670
Yes, it is.

144
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,320
Do you need a tour guide?

145
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,860
I’m the best tour guide in Guanmei.

146
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,740
Pretty guide, fair charge, no swindling.

147
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,450
Ye Qianyu,

148
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:28,710
don’t try to get a customer in my shop.

149
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,960
Go get the water on the fountain.

150
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:30,750
I’m thirsty.

151
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:31,530
Hold on.

152
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,040
This is my card.

153
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,800
If you need water delivery,

154
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,650
errands,

155
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:40,580
take-outs,

156
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,760
or part-timers,

157
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,440
you can call me.

158
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:46,100
20% off for all the services.

159
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,710
New card for water, 200 yuan.

160
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:56,430
200?

161
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,970
Didn’t you charge 150 yuan?

162
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,630
Gas price goes up. So does the delivery.

163
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:06,490
But you never lower the price.

164
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,060
No one makes you buy it.

165
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,070
Wait a sec.

166
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,650
Here, 200 yuan.

167
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,190
Go!

168
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:26,700
By the way, sunshine,

169
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,300
remember to call me.

170
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,290
Come to me and no one dares to swindle you.

171
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:32,150
- Call me. Number is on the card. - Ye Qianyu!

172
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:33,820
Don’t humiliate yourself.

173
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,720
He doesn’t want to call you.

174
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,230
Stop pestering him!

175
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,860
- Go away! - Call me!

176
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,360
Remember to call me!

177
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:38,950
All right!

178
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,460
Listen to me.

179
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:43,170
This girl, Ye Qianyu,

180
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:44,980
is the con artist of Guanmei.

181
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,450
Next time when you see her,

182
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,300
watch your wallet.

183
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,290
Li, your flour is here!

184
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,120
Qianyu,

185
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:13,070
you’re a barbarian.

186
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,710
Jinzhi is gentle, though.

187
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:17,920
But my mom

188
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:19,410
isn’t into you.

189
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,380
Bye.

190
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,500
She’ll fall for me sooner or later.

191
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,890
Water!

192
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,620
Allow me.

193
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,610
Where is Tang?

194
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,650
No idea.

195
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,440
He hasn’t been out since he came back.

196
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:42,440
He’s been in the room for a day.

197
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,860
Who knows what’s he doing?

198
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:51,880
He can’t do anything stupid, can he?

199
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,810
Will he?

200
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,890
Tang, open up!

201
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:56,780
Tang!

202
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,970
Boss, open the door!

203
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:03,650
Fengqiao, how is it going?

204
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,800
He doesn’t answer the call.

205
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,940
Could he try to kill himself again?

206
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:09,360
Shall we call the police?

207
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,320
You guys wait here.

208
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,870
Fengqiao, give me the cleaning staff’s card key.

209
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:13,620
OK.

210
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,220
Qianyu, where are you going?

211
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,290
What are you doing?

212
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:52,780
I’m saving a life.

213
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,060
Tang is in trouble.

214
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,560
Saving a life?

215
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:05,700
What’s up?

216
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,740
Tang is in danger. I’m gonna save him.

217
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:09,320
What are you doing?

218
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,130
His room is below yours. I’m gonna climb down.

219
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,580
Don’t panic.

220
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,640
Let me go down and check it out.

221
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,240
OK.

222
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,080
Open the door from inside.

223
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,060
I’ll be waiting outside.

224
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:34,270
Boss, open the door.

225
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:39,680
How is it going?

226
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:43,490
- Still can’t open it. - No one answers.

227
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,400
Tang! Tang!

228
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,970
Out of the way!

229
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,500
What are you doing?

230
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,240
- Tang! - Boss!

231
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,040
You scared me.

232
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,420
- Boss, are you alright? - Boss!

233
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,690
All right. Enough!

234
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,360
What the hell are you doing?

235
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,040
I was in the storeroom.

236
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,130
You bring a chainsaw?

237
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,270
Were you going to break the door?

238
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:14,840
No, no. no.

239
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,390
Tang,

240
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,990
we heard a scream from your room

241
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:21,810
a moment ago.

242
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:23,540
We wanted to break in

243
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,360
and find out what happened.

244
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,630
Right.

245
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,620
Is it true?

246
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:45,720
Who are you?

247
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,710
I’m here to open the door.

248
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:52,060
Open the door?

249
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,070
He’s…

250
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,280
He’s…

251
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,520
Isn’t Mr. Tang in danger and you wanna help?

252
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,270
It’s proved that

253
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:22,060
I can’t keep the hotel by killing myself.

254
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:24,990
So, don’t worry about me.

255
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:27,800
I won’t do stupid things again.

256
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:31,240
You can leave. Go.

257
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,820
Party is over. You may go.

258
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:36,380
Let’s go.

259
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,700
I’m leaving, too.

260
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:11,190
Dad, take your medicine.

261
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:12,480
OK, put it there.

262
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,300
Junhao,

263
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,780
why did you advance

264
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,210
the starting date of the Project of Guanmei?

265
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:26,980
Dad,

266
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,770
have you ever heard about that

267
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,940
if you finish something in two minutes

268
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,450
but others use ten minutes to finish,

269
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:38,360
your life is worth five times than theirs.

270
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:41,170
Junhao,

271
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,120
you’re too rash.

272
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,260
If the media find it about this incident,

273
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,230
put aside

274
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,650
large amount of resources on crisis PR,

275
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,060
fluctuation on stock price

276
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,530
and negative news would
cause huge loss to Senwell.

277
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,450
Rest assured, Dad.

278
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:05,120
I won’t do anything I’m not sure about.

279
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,780
I’m just worried about you.

280
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:09,050
You’re young and rash.

281
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,290
It causes trouble.

282
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:17,460
Zhang Minghan is watching for his chance to be GM.

283
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:19,020
I hope

284
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,370
you don’t give him the chance.

285
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,250
Dad, have some water.

286
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,620
What’s up?

287
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,150
Nothing. I’m fine.

288
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,050
Work at home again.

289
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,260
Gosh!

290
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,480
You’ve handed the company to Junhao.

291
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,300
Don’t worry about it.

292
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:49,950
I’m sorry.

293
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:51,930
I got jammed on the way.

294
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:53,330
Sorry.

295
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,580
Right on time.

296
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,740
Let’s have dinner.

297
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,630
OK, come. Dinner time.

298
00:17:58,650 --> 00:17:59,140
Let’s go.

299
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:03,420
We’ve been waiting for you.

300
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:04,890
Here.

301
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,980
Help yourself, Yunyi.

302
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:10,740
Yunyi,

303
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:12,860
if you want a job,

304
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,330
I can arrange it.

305
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,420
Why did you go to the job interview?

306
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,460
While you were in Heteng,

307
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,180
you were Creative Director.

308
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:22,360
But now,

309
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,940
in our own company,

310
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,340
you’re down to a manager.

311
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:26,860
Junhao,

312
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:28,290
get a proper position

313
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,100
for Yunyi tomorrow.

314
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:32,510
Dad, Mom,

315
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,080
don’t worry about me.

316
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:36,020
I want to do it on my own.

317
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,210
Yes.

318
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,500
Yunyi is independent and capable.

319
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,120
I believe that in short time,

320
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,260
she’ll make it to the director.

321
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,330
Senwell is strict in management.

322
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,820
Whoever you are,

323
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,340
you have to pass strict appraisal to get promoted.

324
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:54,340
No exception.

325
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,270
Yes, Mr. Shan.

326
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:02,750
OK.

327
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:03,940
Let’s have dinner.

328
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,800
Ziqian, take some more.

329
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,660
Move back home with us.

330
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:12,600
Isn’t it happy to live with family?

331
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,290
Mom,

332
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,940
don’t try to persuade Ziqian.

333
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:19,040
He’s been living on his own since college.

334
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,290
He’s been used to it long time ago.

335
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,300
And if he has a girlfriend,

336
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:25,620
it’s more convenient, isn’t it?

337
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:27,460
There’s a girlfriend?

338
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,530
No.

339
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,260
If there were one, you’d have known.

340
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:41,550
In fact, I gather you around tonight

341
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,300
to make an important announcement.

342
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,030
Right?

343
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:50,330
Junhao, Yunyi,

344
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,600
your dad and I have fixed a date

345
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,540
for your engagement.

346
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,010
It’s in next month.

347
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,580
You’re next. Hurry up.

348
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,100
Congratulations to your engagement!

349
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,330
Come on. Raise a toast!

350
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:15,880
OK.

351
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,390
Come on.

352
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,220
Congratulations!

353
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:18,680
Cheers!

354
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,750
Congratulations!

355
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,130
I don’t want to marry Junhao.

356
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,630
To be precise,

357
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:32,170
I don’t want to marry Junhao now.

358
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:37,620
But…

359
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,260
Why?

360
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,330
I’ll help Mrs. Lin get the soup.

361
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Stubborn girl!

362
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,540
You think I’m 6?

363
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,990
At 6 years old or present,

364
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:49,220
to me, you’re always the same.

365
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,060
Each time when I’m blue,

366
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,180
you comfort me.

367
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,020
Junhao cares about you, too, actually.

368
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:13,230
He’s just too straightforward

369
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,920
and doesn’t know how to express his feelings.

370
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,380
I think my relationship with Junhao

371
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,330
is like a train that has come to the destination

372
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:28,810
soon after it sets off.

373
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:32,230
You weigh more about the journey,

374
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:33,830
not the destination,

375
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,380
right?

376
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,410
Am I too greedy?

377
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,730
What’s wrong about a girlfriend being greedy?

378
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:48,820
It’s just, sometimes,

379
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,710
straightforward men don’t get your hints.

380
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,560
They’re simple-minded.

381
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:58,120
Maybe it’s because all he knows is work.

382
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,300
We both know he’s ambitious in work.

383
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,180
But his world is simple.

384
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,620
You’re the only person he cares except for work.

385
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,370
You have to know

386
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:10,380
he has never set his eyes on other girls,

387
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,070
not even once.

388
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,980
It’s you.

389
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,320
Are you dressed?

390
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,290
Take a look and you’ll see.

391
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,780
This coffee is for you.

392
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,660
Thank you for helping me.

393
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:49,540
You’re welcome.

394
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,550
Anything else?

395
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:02,160
Do you want to have fun outside?

396
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,900
I can be your personal guide.

397
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,730
I like to travel alone.

398
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:11,570
You can try and go around with me.

399
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:12,310
It’s for free.

400
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:14,490
Take it as my return favor.

401
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:16,900
For free?

402
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,580
I never paid for a tour guide.

403
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,420
Stingy man!

404
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,770
Is it really for free?

405
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,300
Of course, it is.

406
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,420
Your coffee.

407
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,780
Would you like some sugar?

408
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:39,760
Gladly.

409
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,070
Morning, Mr. Tang.

410
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:12,810
Hi.

411
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,300
Morning, Director Xu.

412
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,980
This is Miss Fan from Development Department.

413
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,140
Nice to meet you, Mr. Tang.

414
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:20,020
Nice to meet you.

415
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:22,410
Come in.

416
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:22,840
Thanks.

417
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:39,200
Are they from the company

418
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,110
called Senwell?

419
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,120
What are they doing here?

420
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,420
Come on. Let’s have a look.

421
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,350
Go, go, go.

422
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,120
Mr. Tang,

423
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,540
these are Senwell’s compensation terms.

424
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,390
Take a look.

425
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,760
Director Xu,

426
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:07,060
I want to apologize for what happened yesterday.

427
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:09,160
It wasn’t for money.

428
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,010
I just wanted to keep Guanmei Hotel.

429
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,690
Mr. Tang,

430
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,480
I totally understand your feelings for the hotel.

431
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,000
But you don’t have other choices.

432
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,920
According to the agreement,

433
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:22,710
we have the right

434
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:24,570
to demolish it after we gave out

435
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:25,660
the official notice.

436
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,680
But we didn’t do that.

437
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,130
Besides, the 2-million-yuan compensation

438
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:30,880
is the highest price

439
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,970
Senwell has ever offered.

440
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,090
2 million yuan!

441
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,310
You can pay the wage arrears

442
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:36,260
for the staff once and for all with the money.

443
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:37,660
Also, you can buy a new house.

444
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,760
If you don’t want to leave Guanmei,

445
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:40,800
when Senwell

446
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,400
builds up the community here,

447
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,490
you can buy back the house in the village.

448
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,910
New house?

449
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,070
Your house doesn’t have stories

450
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:52,670
and lifes.

451
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:54,620
It’s just

452
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,740
a combination of steels and concrete.

453
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,350
But Guanmei Fishing Village is underdeveloped.

454
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,220
If you do love the village,

455
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,600
please consider about

456
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:07,410
how to make the village better.

457
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,070
Can you give me some time

458
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,310
to think about it?

459
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:26,990
What should we do?

460
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:28,000
Let him think about it.

461
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:28,960
If he agrees,

462
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,030
he’ll have a large sum of money.

463
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:30,830
- Right. - You see it?

464
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:31,360
OK.

465
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,570
I’ll give you a week.

466
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,400
A week later,

467
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,970
whether you sign it or not,

468
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,770
the demolition of Guanmei Hotel

469
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:38,870
is unstoppable.

470
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:42,900
Goodbye then.

471
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,720
He’s coming.

472
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:03,970
Boss,

473
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:05,290
2 million!

474
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,640
You’re going to be rich!

475
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:07,440
Boss,

476
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,650
will we

477
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:10,500
have a handsome dismissal wage?

478
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,730
Yes, will we?

479
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,120
Look at this.

480
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,950
I won’t take the money.

481
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,690
This ring is called True Love.

482
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:29,270
Only when it’s true love

483
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,160
can it be put on her finger tightly.

484
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:33,220
Really?

485
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:35,990
What? You don’t believe it?

486
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:37,620
No.

487
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,930
I like the design of the ring.

488
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:44,190
One day, you’ll believe it.

489
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:57,620
Yunyi,

490
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:00,310
you’re so keen in work.

491
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,660
I want to know well about Guanmei Fishing Village

492
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:04,420
and get familiar with this project soon,

493
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,900
so I can help Junhao.

494
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:17,810
What are you doing here?

495
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:18,980
Where is Dawei?

496
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:21,230
I come for a date.

497
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,360
Why should I bring him along?

498
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:23,920
Date?

499
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:26,170
Yes.

500
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,420
A field research and a date.

501
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:29,820
Multitasking.

502
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,530
You mean field research comes first,

503
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:35,700
then date.

504
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:40,570
He just wants a date with you.

505
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,940
Straightforward man. Too shy to admit it.

506
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:45,280
All right.

507
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,850
I’m leaving you to it.

508
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,840
Try harder.

509
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:50,600
See you.

510
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,460
= Fresh Best Price =

511
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:04,500
= Dance with Rainbow Balloon =

512
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,320
You want to ride the balloon?

513
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,340
Wait here.

514
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,090
Kid,

515
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,780
is the balloon yours?

516
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:47,850
Yes.

517
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,050
Two passengers.

518
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,940
= Money Bag Grocery =

519
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,290
1,000 yuan for two.

520
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,820
Payment made.

521
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,100
Fall in line.

522
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:09,260
In line?

523
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,410
There’s no one else.

524
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:13,330
Why the line?

525
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,770
Four customers for a ride.

526
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,800
If you want to fly it now,

527
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:20,730
pay another thousand.

528
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:32,720
Done.

529
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:35,850
Over there.

530
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:40,470
Let’s go.

531
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,830
This windmill

532
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:49,290
was built a few years ago.

533
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,530
There was a windmill before.

534
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,260
Windmill?

535
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,010
I thought it belonged to Europe.

536
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:57,550
Yes.

537
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,110
100 years ago,

538
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:00,860
a Spanish missionary

539
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,080
came to Guanmei Fishing Village.

540
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,090
To facilitate local people’s livelihood,

541
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:05,230
he hired men

542
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:07,530
to build a windmill here.

543
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,070
The villagers appreciated it.

544
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:12,420
Though, later, the villagers
didn’t use it to husk rice,

545
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:14,190
the story is passed down.

546
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:15,700
We still miss him very much.

547
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,590
In memory of him,

548
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:20,130
we built another windmill here.

549
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:20,670
How is it?

550
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,860
It looks special and beautiful, right?

551
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,470
I don’t know the village has so many stories.

552
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:27,770
Yes, we do.

553
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:29,750
Are you thirsty?

554
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:30,280
A little bit.

555
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:32,360
Is there a convenience store nearby?

556
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:34,330
I’m a moving convenience store.

557
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:34,890
Hold on.

558
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:40,130
This

559
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:42,520
is Ye’s Flower Tea I made specially for you.

560
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:43,670
Take a sip.

561
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:48,620
How do you like it?

562
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:50,500
Not bad.

563
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:53,180
I usually charge 80 yuan for a pot.

564
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,670
This…

565
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,520
This is free of charge.

566
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,730
Have some more. Here you go.

567
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,460
Thanks.

568
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,240
Want some more?

569
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,270
So?

570
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:13,650
Do you feel good

571
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:14,980
to have me as your guide now?

572
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:17,640
A little bit.

573
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,320
Have some more.

574
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,840
You’re different today.

575
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:26,100
You rode a balloon with me.

576
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,180
I rode it with you

577
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:29,620
because you like it.

578
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:35,220
Will you do everything with me

579
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,610
as long as it’s what I like?

580
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,350
Of course.

581
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,700
But on one condition.

582
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:46,310
You need to tell me what you like.

583
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,770
Because I don’t like to guess.

584
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:08,620
This is…

585
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,340
The ring is called True Love.

586
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:22,350
It’s said only when it’s true love,

587
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:24,920
can it be put on the other’s finger tightly.

588
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:33,940
Yunyi,

589
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,240
marry me.

590
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,480
You have to put it on my finger to prove it.

591
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,640
The ring!

592
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:08,720
Forget about the ring. Hold on to me.

593
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:11,580
What’s going on?

594
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,820
The tie-down cord was severed.

595
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,180
Severed?

596
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:17,520
Shengzhe,

597
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:18,890
look at your balloon.

598
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:22,300
Crap!

599
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:24,700
Except for windmill,

600
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,750
we have

601
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:28,780
Devil Forest and Dolphin Island here.

602
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,100
Anyway, there are a lot of
interesting sites to go.

603
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,680
I can take you there.

604
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,040
All right.

605
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,290
What’s up?

606
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:40,210
I’m busy now.

607
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,220
Sis, we have a big problem.

608
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,550
The tie-down cord of the balloon was severed.

609
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:44,680
There are two customers up there.

610
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,450
Ah?

611
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:47,830
OK, OK.

612
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:48,910
I’ll be back now.

613
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:50,910
Excuse me,

614
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:52,790
I have an emergency now.

615
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:54,070
Go around by yourself.

616
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,100
By the way,

617
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:58,160
remember to return my cup when you drink up.

618
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:00,120
I live in Money Bag Grocery.

619
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,590
What are you laughing at?

620
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,760
This is the most romantic

621
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:28,820
and exciting adventure I’ve ever had.

622
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:31,950
Yunyi,

623
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,190
we almost lost our lives.

624
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:35,760
You think it’s romantic.

625
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,060
What’s up?

626
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,240
Junhao,

627
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,370
I think God gave us this chance

628
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,880
to prove our love to each other.

629
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:06,470
The moment when the balloon dropped,

630
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:09,960
I felt you protected my life by risking yours.

631
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,490
Junhao,

632
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:19,220
I felt your love to me.

633
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,480
I do.

634
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:27,480
You do what?

635
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,600
I do want to marry you.

636
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:57,140
But the ring is lost.

637
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:58,800
It doesn’t matter.

638
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:02,790
In my heart, the ring is already on my finger.

639
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:07,820
I’m sure about you now.

640
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,460
No more doubts.

641
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,060
I love you.

642
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:23,680
Are you cold?

643
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,210
The wind is kind of strong.

644
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:29,290
Why don’t you wait in the car?

645
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,420
I’m going to talk to the balloon owner.

646
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:57,280
It looks worth of a lot of money.

647
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:14,880
You?

648
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:24,830
Stop!

649
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,080
You liar!

650
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,430
You wrote an ineffective IOU.

651
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,250
Now pay the money. Hurry!

652
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,040
I forgot to tell Dawei.

653
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,670
The IOU I wrote is real.

654
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,360
The number is real, too.

655
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:45,630
I just

656
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:47,350
didn’t tell the owner of the phone about it.

657
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:49,380
He’ll pay you the money.

658
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,640
You think I would believe you again?

659
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:53,650
If you didn’t go against your word,

660
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:55,650
I’d have bought my mom’s piano back.

661
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:57,450
Hands off first.

662
00:39:57,610 --> 00:39:58,720
Pay me and I’ll let go.

663
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:02,320
The money!

664
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:03,060
Let go!

665
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:03,840
No!

666
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:06,580
Don’t move.

667
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,120
Hello, Shengzhe?

668
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:12,450
The balloon landed on the beach.

669
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:14,040
They should be safe.

670
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,830
The balloon is yours?

671
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:19,480
Bye.

672
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:24,850
I do have a balloon.

673
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:26,140
The one and only on this island.

674
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,730
But what’s it with you?

675
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:28,630
Pay back now!

676
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,060
You know it almost got me killed?

677
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:44,600
You were riding it?

678
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:45,300
Yes.

679
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,100
I rode it and I fell from it.

680
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,400
You let customers ride the balloon

681
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,620
before you checked it.

682
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,180
You ought to be held liable to your misconduct.

683
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,060
That was an accident.

684
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:01,820
Besides,

685
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,560
you’re safe, aren’t you?

686
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:06,020
I can refund your fares.

687
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:11,780
Wait!

688
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,610
You owe me 8,500 yuan!

689
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:27,390
What are you doing?

690
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:28,100
Calling the police.

691
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,520
Buddy,

692
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:34,680
let’s talk about it.

693
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:36,170
Didn’t I say

694
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,090
I could refund the fares?

695
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:39,010
500 yuan. Is 500 enough?

696
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:41,030
I’ve never met

697
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:42,590
such a shameless person like you

698
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,220
who has no limit in making money.

699
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:48,840
You’re the shameless one.

700
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,690
I saved you and dressed you out of kindness.

701
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:53,850
And you fooled me with a wrong number.

702
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:55,350
Doesn’t your conscience trouble you?

703
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:56,620
Doesn’t it?

704
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,840
Besides,

705
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,990
my balloon never went wrong before.

706
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:02,930
How come it did when you were on it?

707
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:07,290
Did you cut the cord loose on purpose

708
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:09,050
so you could blackmail me?

709
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:09,960
Now,

710
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:11,220
who is the one

711
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,460
that has no limit in making money?

712
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,280
Who is it?

713
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,650
Where do you get the ring?

714
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:19,260
It’s mine.

715
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:20,450
Any proof?

716
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:24,790
I picked it up, so it’s mine.

717
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:30,440
What are you doing?

718
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,070
What are you doing?

719
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:33,120
Give my ring back to me.

720
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:35,860
What are you doing? Hey!

721
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,900
Stop!

722
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,470
What are you doing?

723
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:44,210
You robbed me!

724
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:47,400
You like it? Keep it.

725
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:48,710
I don’t like things

726
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:49,880
touched by others,

727
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:51,360
especially by you.

728
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:57,600
You liar!

729
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:59,660
Don’t let me see you again.

730
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,230
