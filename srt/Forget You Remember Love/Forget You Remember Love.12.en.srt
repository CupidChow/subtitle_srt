Hush. Slowly.

13
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,410
Mom.

14
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,060
Haven’t you slept?

15
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,200
Now

16
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:34,800
you call me mom?

17
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,900
Why didn’t you think of me
when you used my credit card?

18
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,010
Sorry.

19
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:51,450
We bought fried chicken for you.

20
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,650
Wonderful.

21
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,590
Your dinner cost 480 yuan,

22
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,120
yet you just bought me some chicken.

23
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:12,870
Stop.

24
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:16,860
Tonghao.

25
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,860
You acted as a rich man today.

26
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,880
Now it’s time to get back to your real role.

27
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,030
We received tons of groceries today

28
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:27,030
stored in the warehouse.

29
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,400
Don’t go to bed until you finish the work.

30
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,410
Go.

31
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,610
Hurry up!

32
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,830
Ye Qianyu.

33
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:01,780
I told you many times

34
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,920
to keep a distance

35
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,300
from that suspicious Tonghao.

36
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,180
You two came back so late.

37
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,920
Taichu will mistake it.

38
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:15,040
I have nothing to do with Taichu.

39
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:20,700
Taichu asked me for the address of your party.

40
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,790
He went there as soon as his meeting was over.

41
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:24,780
I called you

42
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,040
but you didn’t answer.

43
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,320
I don’t know.

44
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,070
I didn’t see him.

45
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,420
Taichu

46
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,820
deliberately ended the meeting early

47
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,070
to go to your party,

48
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,540
yet Tonghao arrived

49
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,600
before him.

50
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:40,570
Ye Qianyu.

51
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,660
Keep your mind clear.

52
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,680
Can’t you tell

53
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,360
the prince from the frog

54
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,790
between Taichu

55
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:49,170
and Tonghao?

56
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,420
You said you’d marry a rich man.

57
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,420
Don’t forget that.

58
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,610
Alright. I see.

59
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,540
I haven’t finished my words.

60
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,380
Shan Junhao, the general manager of Senwell,

61
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,560
went abroad for secret research

62
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,850
and hasn’t come back yet.

63
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,080
Shan Yaolong, the chairman
of Senwell, passed away.

64
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,090
Shan Junhao didn’t attend the funeral.

65
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:22,140
Zhang Minghan became

66
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,680
the general manager of Senwell.

67
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,900
Shan Junhao’s whereabouts is a secret.

68
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,170
What exactly is Senwell hiding?

69
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,440
Hello.

70
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,650

What are you doing?

72
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:22,660
I’m sorting out goods.

73

Let me help you.

74
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:25,990
OK.

75
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,160
You come to make troubles?

76
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:37,900
No.

77

Let me send you to the inn in a while.

I’m still a kid.

Don’t go too far.

84

Tonghao.

85
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,290
Are you full?

86
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,330
Help me carry a case of beer from the warehouse.

87
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,500
I’m going to carry the beer in the warehouse.

88
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:54,180
Tonghao.

89
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,460
Listen to me.

90
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,770
You lost your memory.

91
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:03,240
You cannot be in love with Qianyu.

92
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:07,910
Why not?

93
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,540
You have no memory.

94
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:16,170
You can’t keep your promise.

95
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:20,090
Once your memory is recovered

96
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,620
and you return to your original life,

97
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,730
what should Qianyu do?

98
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:29,530
I will not let Qianyu get hurt.

99
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,600
I will be responsible for Qianyu.

100
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,540
I promise.

101
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,650

Tonghao.

103
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,500
I know you are a good boy.

104
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:44,720
And

105
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:45,740
I don’t mean to

106
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,370
get you two lovers separated.

107
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:49,960
It’s just that

108
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,360
your relationship

109
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,210
has a great risk.

110

Tonghao. Let’s go to work.

111
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:08,550

= Director Room =

118
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,760
Senwell has long admired you.

119
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,610
You rejected our invitations many times.

120
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,090
I never thought you’d come in person.

121

Director Xu.

122
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,960
I’ll get to the point.

123
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,270
Is Shan Junhao missing?

124
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,980
Don’t believe

125
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,980
these groundless gossips.

126
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,400
Mr. Shan went abroad for research.

127
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,830
I just mean to confirm it.

128
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,830
Maybe I know where Shan Junhao is.

129
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,960
But I need to know

130
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,360
what he looks like first.

131
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,980
What’s your purpose here?

132
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,440

133
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,410
If you trust me,

134
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:33,970
please show me his photo.

135
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,010
I’m considering for GQ Ventures,

136
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,080
for Senwell

137
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,690
and also my projects.

138
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,050
The man I saw was named Tonghao.

139
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,510
He works in Guanmei Inn.

140
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,560
I’m almost convinced that

141
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:06,930
he is Shan Junhao.

142
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,680
It feels so good

143
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:25,990
to have a cup of coffee in the morning.

144
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,440
The guests of our Guanmei Inn

145
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,180
are more and more.

146
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:31,860

Are you sleepy?

150
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,010
I’m not sleepy once I see you.

151

What’s wrong with them?

152
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:53,820
I’m going to deliver goods.

153
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,770
You can’t keep looking at me.

154
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,430
I have you in my heart.

155
00:12:58,130 --> 00:12:59,220
I can see you

156
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:01,070
whenever I close my eyes.

157
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,490
You’re honey-mouthed today. Did you eat honey?

158
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:05,560
You don’t kiss me. How do you know?

159
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,090
You are so unabashed.

160
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,300
I didn’t know this before.

161
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:11,800
Because

162
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,800
we hadn’t fallen in love.

163
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,740
There’s an affair between them.

164
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,300
Are they in love?

165
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,180
Take photos.

166
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,280
You are...

167
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,880
Alright. Go to deliver the goods.

168
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:46,660
I’m leaving.

169
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,830
I’ll walk you in.

170
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,200
What are you doing?

171
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,840
We’re watching a live show.

172

Qianyu.

173
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,720
You are blushing.

174
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,520
You didn’t blush

175
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,800
even when you mistakenly

176
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:15,720
went to men’s hot-spring pool.

177
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,270
Did you ever do that?

178
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:22,600
No.

179
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,960
It was in kindergarten.

180
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,350
Oh, right. Tonghao.

Go to the market

183

and buy some ornaments for Guanmei Inn today.

184
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,850
I’ll take care of the chores

185
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,180
in the inn.

186
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,100

00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:14,700
= Guanmei Inn =

194
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,170
Director Xu. What brings you here?

195
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,340
I ask for Mr. Tang.

196
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,570
Mr. Tang.

197
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:26,400
Tang.

198
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,610
Tang.

199
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:28,880
Director Xu asks for you.

200
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,540
Hello. Director Xu.

201
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:34,260
Mr. Tang.

202
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,620
Do you have an employee named Tonghao here?

203
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,330
Yes.

204
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,220
I want to meet him.

205
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,240
What’s the matter for him?

206
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,500
He... He is just one of my employees.

207
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,620
Is it inconvenient?

208
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:55,210
No.

209
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,220
Oh, right.

210
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,400
He asked for leave

211
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:04,100
today.

212
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,430
Where does he live?

213
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,260
I don’t know.

214
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,750
Tang. You know it.

215
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:24,880
He lives in Money Bag Grocery.

216
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,560
Why don’t you shut your big mouth?

217
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:42,610
I... Did I say anything wrong?

218
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:54,070
Welcome.

219
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,230
You are Director Xu from Senwell?

220
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,730
What brings you here?

221
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,660
I ask for Tonghao.

222
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:03,740
He isn’t here.

223
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:04,810
What’s the matter for him?

224
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,250
Tonghao isn’t Ye Qianyu’s cousin.

225
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:06,770
Right?

226
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,390
I... I don’t know what you’re talking about.

227
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,260
Why do you ask so?

228
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,420
Do you know who he is?

229
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,350
He... He is my relative. What’s wrong?

230
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:20,180
None of your business.

231
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,160
Cut the crap.

232
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,060
Go.

233
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,210
Don’t disturb my business.

234
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:27,520
You, leave!

235
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:36,650
Ridiculous.

236
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,430
Director Xu.

237
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,310
Anything else?

238
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,150
I won’t leave

239
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,630
until I see Tonghao.

240
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,560
Mr. Tang.

241
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:40,660
May I use your phone?

242
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,270
Sure.

243
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,050
How much is this?

244
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,490
180 yuan.

245
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,070
180?

246
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,840
OK. I’ll take it.

247
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:19,650
This one?

248
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:20,060
Yes.

249
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:20,620
OK.

250
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,140
Mr. Tang.

251
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,900
Wait with me.

252
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,850
Well.

253
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,470
Does Tonghao offend Mr. Xu?

254
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:22,280
How come it’s disturbing?

255
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,900
Right.

256
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,870
They’ve been sitting for long

257
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,940
without any word.

258
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:31,150
I’m wondering

259
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,990
how Tonghao offends Mr. Xu.

260
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:34,940
Listen.

261
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,080
Could it be that Tonghao is so capable

262
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:43,440
that Senwell intends to hire him?

263
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,000
What?

264
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,370
No way.

265
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,600
Tonghao is the idol in Guanmei Inn.

266
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,040
How can he be taken away by him?

267
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,890
Am I not the idol in Guanmei Inn?

268
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,940
I thought it was me.

269
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:06,350
Sheng.

270
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:07,390
Master.

271
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:07,870
Give me a hand.

272
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:09,080
- Tonghao. - Coming.

273
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,250
Tonghao.

274
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:12,040
- Here. - Be careful.

275
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,000
Come to help.

276
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:15,080
Come on.

277
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,300
Hurry.

278
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,690
Put it here.

279
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,580
Mr. Tang. How is it going today?

280
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,250
Thanks to you, it’s good.

281
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,800
Are you tired?

282
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:32,820
No. It’s my job.

283
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,780
I’m going in if nothing else.

284
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:41,760
Junhao.

285
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,970
I pretended

286
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:52,860
to be Shan Junhao yesterday.

287
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,630
Don’t mistake it.

288
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:00,310
You are...

289
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,900
He is Mr. Xu from Senwell,

290
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,520
also the interim chairman of Senwell.

291
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:12,120
Hello, Mr. Xu. I’m Tonghao.

292
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:16,820
Junhao.

293
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,350
Why are you here?

294
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:22,030
Why don’t you go home?

295
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,150
You made a mistake.

296
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,900
I am not Shan Junhao.

297
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,870
I am Tonghao.

298
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,700
This is my home.

299
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:35,390
I acted as Shan Junhao yesterday.

300
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:36,480
It was a prank.

301
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,330
Don’t be mad.

302
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,050
What are you talking about?

303
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,590
We grow up together.

304
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,760
I know you well.

305
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,110
How can I get it wrong?

306
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,900
You are Shan Junhao.

307
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,900
What are you talking about? I’m confused.

308
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:58,080
Go home with me.

309
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,600
I... Where to?

310
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,280
I’m waiting for Ye Qianyu to pick me up.

311
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,590
Ye Qianyu?

312
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:09,110
Yes.

313
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,710
My girlfriend.

314
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:15,880
Ye Qianyu is your girlfriend?

315
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:18,380
What about Fan Yunyi?

316
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,270
Fan Yunyi is your fiancée.

317
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,540
Fiancée?

318
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,580
What’s wrong with you?

319
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:27,880
You leave behind your family

320
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:28,960
and your company.

321
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:29,810
You know...

322
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,730
You know how worried we are

323
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:32,930
when you are missing?

324
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:34,610
You know how we spend the days without you?

325
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,380
He lost his memory.

326
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,270
He has forgotten he is Shan Junhao.

327
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,320
Lost memory?

328
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,500
Yes.

329
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,960
He lost his memory of the past.

330
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:00,960
So,

331
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,800
he didn’t go home for a reason.

332
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,610
I should be blamed.

333
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:11,500
I recognized him,

334
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:14,300
but I didn’t tell him the truth.

335
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:16,360
Mr. Xu.

336
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:18,140
Don’t blame Tonghao.

337
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,960
It’s my fault.

338
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,640
I’m selfish.

339
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,360
I thought

340
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,390
as long as Shan Junhao didn’t go back to Senwell,

341
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,320
Senwell would not tear down

342
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,320
Guanmei Inn.

343
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,810
I thought it

344
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,050
too simple.

345
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,340
Tang Shunming.

346
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:40,730
You are bold.

347
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,360
You know you made a big trouble?

348
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,270
Mr. Xu. I’m sorry.

349
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:45,430
I’m wrong.

350
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:49,270
Junhao.

351
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:50,840
If you lose your memory,

352
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,540
we’ll get the best doctor to treat you.

353
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:54,290
Go home with me now.

354
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,620
I don’t remember what you said.

355
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,680
I don’t know her, either.

356
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,650
I only know

357
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,090
I won’t leave here.

358
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:08,360
I won’t leave Qianyu.

359
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,820
Ye Qianyu?

360
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,450
You only have Ye Qianyu in your heart?

361
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,880
You know how sad Fan Yunyi is

362
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,240
when you’re missing?

363
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,400
Yunyi.

364
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:19,910
Did I love her?

365
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:23,130
If I did,

366
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,600
why don’t I remember anything?

367
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,290
Shan Junhao.

368
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:36,860
You scum!

369
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,280
Mr. Xu.

370
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,640
Calm down.

371
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,440
Give Tonghao more time.

372
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,080
He will recall it slowly.

373
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,260
Tonghao.

374
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:58,950
Are you alright?

375
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,710
No. You’re bleeding.

376
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,550
Hurry.

377
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,060
Alright.

378
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,400
Go upstairs now.

379
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:11,270
I have something

380
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,940
to talk with Mr. Xu.

381
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:14,910
Go upstairs first.

382
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,320
Hurry.

383
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:45,820
Mr. Xu.

384
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,260
I’m so sorry.

385
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,960
It’s useless to apologize.

386
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,350
You know you made a big trouble?

387
00:26:59,080 --> 00:26:59,970
I do.

388
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,980
I know it’s useless whatever I say.

389
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:05,760
But

390
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,140
at lease Mr. Shan is alive.

391
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,890
It’s good news

392
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,240
both for you

393
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,560
and Senwell.

394
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,340
Right?

395
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,920
You mean

396
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,480
you saved him for us?

397
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:20,520
No...

398
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,000
I should think you, right?

399
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:23,480
No.

400
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,580
I don’t mean that at all.

401
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:29,040
Tang. Did you see Tonghao?

402
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,140
Director Xu.

403
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,650
Tonghao is upstairs?

404
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,750
Ye Qianyu.

405
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,410
What did you do to Junhao?

406
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:45,720
How can you hide him

407
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,580
irresponsibly?

408
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,550
Do you know how worried

409
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:50,530
his family, his friends

410
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:52,120
and his fiancée are?

411
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:52,710
You know it?

412
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:54,620
You’ve ruined the life of Shan family.

413
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,670
Director Xu.

414
00:27:57,850 --> 00:27:59,510
What are you talking about? I don’t understand.

415
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,660
Tonghao is Shan Junhao.

416
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,870
Don’t you know it?

417
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,750
Tonghao

418
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,590
is Shan Junhao?

419
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,000
Ye Qianyu.

420
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,530
Listen up.

421
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,340
Shan Junhao doesn’t belong here.

422
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:42,240
And

423
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,720
you and he

424
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:47,500
are people from two worlds.

425
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,370
Mr. Xu.

426
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:56,890
Qianyu is innocent.

427
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,590
In the whole Guanmei Fishing Village,

428
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,130
only I know

429
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,520
Tonghao is Shan Junhao.

430
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:10,570
Innocent?

431
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,610
Junhao lost memory

432
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:14,650
and you keep him here.

433
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:16,920
Isn’t he innocent?

434
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,660
Mr. Xu.

435
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,320
You already know Mr. Shan is here.

436
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,360
He won’t be missing again.

437
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,310
There is no result

438
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,680
even if you stay here.

439
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,120
Besides,

440
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,740
you hit him just now.

441
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:44,280
He won’t go with you.

442
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:47,620
You may give us

443
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:50,380
and Mr. Shan more time.

444
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,930
We will surely let Mr. Shan go back.

445
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:34,300
Sorry.

446
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,680
We are just few steps away,

447
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:20,530
but it is like tens of thousands of light years.

448
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,990
I cannot walk to him.

449
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:27,860
Tonghao.

450
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:30,520
Sorry.

451
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,810
I ruined your life.

452
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,820
Sorry.

453
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:54,160
Go to your room first.

454
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,220
I’m sorry, Mr. Shan.

455
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,960
Only I know the truth in Guanmei

456
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,850
Fishing Village.

457
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:40,090
I’m too selfish

458
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,260
to tell you the truth.

459
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:46,460
Back then,

460
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,190
I thought as long as you didn’t
go back to Senwell,

461
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:54,220
no one would tear down my inn.

462
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,170
But I was wrong.

463
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,380
Zhang Minghan

464
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:03,610
is more radical than you.

465
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:07,640
You didn’t go home

466
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:10,140
due to my selfishness.

467
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,010
I feel sorry to you.

468
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,870
Please don’t blame

469
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,270
Qianyu.

470
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:25,110
She is an innocent child.

471
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,050
Mr. Tang.

472
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:32,280
I don’t blame anyone.

473
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,030
Losing memory is like a journey,

474
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:41,170
a journey of inner heart.

475
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:47,350
It makes me know my inner heart better.

476
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:52,440
I have a happy life here

477
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,730
every day.

478
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,450
It’s happy and warm

479
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:02,480
to stay here with you.

480
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:07,750
Even though I’m Shan Junhao,

481
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:13,240
I will still be Tonghao.

482
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,510
Really?

483
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,080
I feel you have changed

484
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,460
completely.

485
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,930
What was I like before?

486
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,150
You used to be

487
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,010
cold

488
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:36,550
and arrogant.

489
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:39,820
Don’t mind it.

490
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:42,730
I don’t.

491
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,300
At that time,

492
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,640
you were at your prime,

493
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,550
young and rich.

494
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:53,170
It’s understandable to be arrogant.

495
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,210
But now you’ve changed.

496
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:00,270
You are kind,

497
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,600
friendly,

498
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,330
and considerate.

499
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,780
You even went to find Chinese white dolphins

500
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:13,450
for Guanmei Fishing Village.

501
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,390
You’re willing to

502
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:18,450
protect Guanmei Fishing Village with us.

503
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:22,800
We’re all fond of you

504
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:24,390
now.

505
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:33,330
Actually, it’s Qianyu who gets me changed.

506
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,310
Qianyu

507
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,710
does have that kind of appeal.

508
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,360
Whoever stays with her

509
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,830
will be happy.

510
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:50,470
Right.

511
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:53,520
That’s enough.

512
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,100
Mr. Tang.

513
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,520
You may leave.

514
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,710
I want to stay alone for a while.

515
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:10,440
OK.

516
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,340
You may clear your mind.

517
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:04,200
Daisy?

518
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,820
Daisy?

519
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:08,370
I bring you goodies.

520
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:08,990
Come here.

521
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:09,640
Daisy.

522
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:13,500
Daisy!

523
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:14,760
Daisy!

524
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:16,610
Daisy?

525
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:26,770
Daisy!

526
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:37,900
= Yunyi =

527
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,890
Hello, Yunyi?

528
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:43,240
Daisy ate shampoo by mistake.

529
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,260
I’m taking her to hospital.

530
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,010
Come here.

531
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,640
OK. I’ll be right there.

532
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,140
Daisy.

533
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:55,910
How do you feel now?

534
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,150
Don’t worry.

535
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:01,990
She will be fine

536
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:03,490
after some rest.

537
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:06,690
You must put away your shampoo afterwards.

538
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,410
She can’t resist the fragrance.

539
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:10,550
Thank you, Yunyi.

540
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:13,400
If not you,

541
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,400
Daisy would be in great trouble.

542
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:19,880
It means Daisy and I have telepathy.

543
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:21,250
Am I right, Daisy?

544
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,100
Stay with Daisy.

545
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:29,260
I’m going to get a blanket for her.

546
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,580
It will be more comfortable.

547
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:31,790
OK.

548
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,160
Yunyi. What’s wrong?

549
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,510
I made a windmill to Junhao,

550
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:21,090
but he said it’s too ugly. He didn’t want it.

551
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,640
I think it’s beautiful.

552
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:29,180
I’ve never seen such a special windmill.

553
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:34,620
Do you really think it’s beautiful?

554
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,000
Yes.

555
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:37,720
Yunyi.

556
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,290
Can you give it to me?

557
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,530
I like it.

558
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,320
Sure.

559
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:54,430
Yunyi. Did you find it?

560
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,440
Ziqian.

561
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,300
Do you still keep this windmill?

562
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:12,090
It was

563
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:14,360
made by you.

564
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,720
How can I throw it away?

565
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,070
Ziqian.

566
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:39,480
Thank you.

567
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,170
You’re always with me

568
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,500
when I need you.

569
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,370
Yunyi.

570
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,840
I have to tell you something.

571
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,080
I met someone today.

572
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,250
It was

573
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:38,480
Junhao who was missing.

574
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:59,190
Laundry detergent, 3 yuan.

575
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:01,040
Biscuits, 0.7 yuan.

576
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,800
Popsicle, 88.8 yuan.

577
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:04,810
Lollipop, 79 yuan.

578
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:08,140
The prices of these commodities are all wrong.

579
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,520
Oh. I’ll rewrite it.

580
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,290
Don’t. Stop.

581
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,130
Look at you.

582
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:15,610
You will write it wrong again.

583
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:20,000
Love makes women fools.

584
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:26,620
Qianyu. Did you quarrel with Tonghao?

585
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:29,070
No.

586
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:31,860
Are you sure?

587
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:36,160
Be careful.

588
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:36,840
What’s going on?

589
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:40,840
Butterball. What’s wrong with your leg?

590
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:43,720
Mama Jinzhi.

591
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:46,190
Mr. Tang fell down and got his leg injured.

592
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,140
He needs to rest for some time.

593
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,950
I just brought him back from the hospital.

594
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,100
Why did you bring him to me?

595
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:01,820
Guanmei Inn is under renovation.

596
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,110
They are too busy

597
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:05,980
to take care of him.

598
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:08,480
So I bring him here.

599
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:10,690
What do you mean?

600
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,120
You want me to take care of this butterball?

601
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:15,370
Mom.

602
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,380
He gets injured.

603
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,360
Please take care of him.

604
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,380
You want him stay alone

605
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,380
and starve?

606
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,040
Where will he live then?

607
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:26,260
We have four people at home.

608
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,960
It’s already crowded.

609
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:28,760
Where will he sleep?

610
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:31,180
I can sleep in the warehouse.

611
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,310
Let Mr. Tang live with Shengzhe.

612
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,490
Don’t snore at night.

613
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:37,180
Don’t get up before 7 a.m.

614
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:37,890
Don’t touch my things.

615
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:39,050
Don’t drag my quit.

616
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:41,000
Yes. Yes.

617
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:45,360
Look. Shengzhe agreed.

618
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,260
Alright.

619
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,010
But

620
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,160
you have to pay me.

621
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:59,360
2,000 yuan a month for food and lodging.

622
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:01,370
Chen Jinzhi.

623
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:03,660
You only know money.

624
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,140
Why don’t you rob the bank?

625
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:08,620
Live here or not?

626
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:09,240
I...

627
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:12,260
Yes.

628
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:13,430
Yes.

629
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:26,690
Yunyi.

630
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:27,800
Yunyi!

631
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:28,880
Where are you going?

632
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,710
I have to look for Junhao now.

633
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:31,880
Yunyi. Don’t be like this!

634
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:32,420
Yunyi.

635
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:34,740
Even if you go, he doesn’t know you.

636
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,410
Why?

637
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,040
He lost his memory

638
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,670
and doesn’t remember anything.

639
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,960
He only knows his name is Tonghao.

640
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:54,160
Even...

641
00:44:58,980 --> 00:44:59,980
Even what?

642
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,450
Even what?

643
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,370
Even he has a girlfriend.

644
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:19,310
Girlfriend?

645
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:24,970
