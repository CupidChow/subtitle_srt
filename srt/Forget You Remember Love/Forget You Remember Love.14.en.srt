right?

13
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:02,800
This is his home.

14
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Of course he’ll come back.

15
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:07,720
Ziqian.

16
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,110
I’m sorry.

17
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,160
Why did you apologize?

18
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,440
Thank you

19
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,720
for your company lately.

20
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,800
Otherwise, I’d collapse.

21
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,190
Also, without your care,

22
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,750
mom would be in worse shape.

23
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,800
You’re our rock.

24
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,960
In the past,

25
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:38,830
I...

26
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,800
I did all this out of my free will.

27
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,800
I don’t need anything in return.

28
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,470
Yunyi.

29
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,000
Don’t think too much.

30
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,360
All you need is to doll yourself up

31
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,880
and show Junhao your best side.

32
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:56,670
That’s it.

33
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,470
Everything will be fine.

34
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,670
Where are we?

35
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,030
Get off.

36
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,320
The game isn’t over yet.

37
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,080
Your turn.

38
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,390
What?

39
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,080
Put it on.

40
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,030
Fine.

41
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,160
Where are you taking me?

42
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,350
Someplace fun.

43
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,440
It’s a surprise.

44
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,390
Don’t be scared.

45
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,950
I’m your eyes.

46
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:31,880
Let’s go.

47
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:47,600
Let’s go.

48
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,200
Qianyu,

49
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:31,390
if one day,

50
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,270
I’m really blind,

51
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,760
I hope we can be like this,

52
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,350
walking together with our hands held.

53
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,200
I’ll never let go of you.

54
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,640
OK.

55
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:58,950
Let’s go.

56
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:24,350
Hold on.

57
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,350
What’s up?

58
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,160
There’s no money on my face.

59
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,270
Why did you touch it?

60
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:55,510
To remember your look

61
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,350
in case I mistake others for you

62
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,720
if I can’t see.

63
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,550
Hands, too.

64
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,790
I also need to keep them in mind

65
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:18,070
so that I can tell it’s you from your hands.

66
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,390
What if one day,

67
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,070
you lose your memory again?

68
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,550
Actually, there’s a kind of special memory

69
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:35,760
called emotional memory.

70
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,070
No matter what happens,

71
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,670
I will never forget about you.

72
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,640
You can’t run away from me.

73
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,040
Why is your hand wet?

74
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,950
It’s too hot.

75
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,350
My hand is sweating.

76
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:19,670
Let’s go.

77
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:36,590
Wait.

78
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:39,960
Are we there?

79
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:47,880
Tonghao,

80
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:54,400
I have

81
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,640
a wish card

82
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,080
that I’d like you to cash in.

83
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:09,590
Sure.

84
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,230
You... You OK?

85
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,590
Let’s go.

86
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,200
Lift your foot.

87
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:06,910
Tonghao,

88
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,640
in front of you is a door.

89
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,080
If you believe me,

90
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,440
just open it.

91
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:42,080
OK.

92
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,880
But before you go in,

93
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,200
count to 20.

94
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,230
Should I begin now?

95
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:56,910
One.

96
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,000
Two.

97
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:09,280
Three.

98
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:14,910
Four.

99
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:20,880
Five.

100
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:28,470
Six.

101
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,440
Seven.

102
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:39,110
Eight.

103
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,590
Nine.

104
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:49,880
Ten.

105
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:58,000
Eleven.

106
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:09,880
Twelve.

107
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,550
Thirteen.

108
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,230
Fourteen.

109
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:29,840
Fifteen.

110
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:34,200
Sixteen.

111
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:36,670
Seventeen.

112
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,110
Eighteen.

113
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,150
Nineteen.

114
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,760
Twenty.

115
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,150
What exactly do you want me to see?

116
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,150
Junhao.

117
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,550
Welcome home!

118
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:50,790
Junhao.

119
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,400
You’re finally back.

120
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:57,790
Where’s Qianyu?

121
00:14:59,230 --> 00:14:59,840
Qianyu?

122
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,230
Who’s Qianyu?

123
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:07,910
Who are you?

124
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,110
I’m your mom.

125
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:17,710
Junhao.

126
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:18,910
What’s wrong?

127
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:19,840
You...

128
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,320
What happened to you?

129
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,200
I don’t know you.

130
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,880
How could he not know me?

131
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,080
What’s going on?

132
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,150
What’s wrong with him?

133
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:37,020
= Tonghao will leave Ye Qianyu forever =

134
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,030
You asked Qianyu to trick me here.

135
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:50,960
I’m leaving!

136
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:52,350
- Junhao. - Junhao.

137
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,670
This is your home.

138
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,350
- Where are you going, Junhao?
- I’m going back to Qianyu.

139
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:56,200
Junhao.

140
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:58,280
Ye Qianyu fooled us all.

141
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:59,880
Why do you still want to see her?

142
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,640
Watch your language.

143
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,910
She’s my girlfriend,

144
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:11,110
my family.

145
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:13,350
Don’t insult her.

146
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,350
Shan Junhao,

147
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,520
wake up!

148
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,840
No one can separate me from Qianyu.

149
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,580
- Junhao! - Junhao!

150
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,110
Junhao!

151
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,760
Qianyu!

152
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,670
Why didn’t he recognize me?

153
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,770
I’m… I’m his…

154
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:00,320
I’m his mom.

155
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:02,960
I gave birth to him.

156
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,560
How could he not know me?

157
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,160
What happened?

158
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,430
Tell me what happened?

159
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,140
Aunt Jiang,

160
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,430
we managed to find him,

161
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:16,040
but...

162
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,070
But what? Say it!

163
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:20,760
Mom.

164
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,400
He doesn’t remember anything.

165
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,350
He lost his memory

166
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,800
after the car accident.

167
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:35,800
What?

168
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,310
He doesn’t remember you,

169
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,760
me,

170
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,800
or Ziqian.

171
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:48,350
Neither does he remember who he really is.

We can take him to the hospital.

231
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:06,760
Hold on.

232
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,000
I’ll call it myself.

233
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:26,400
What are you doing?

234
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,710
What about this woman?

235
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:43,920
Take care of them both.

236
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:52,190
Someone else is coming. What to do?

237
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,640
Leave them here. Let’s go.

238
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,000
Junhao!

239
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:13,710
Ye Qianyu?

240
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,110
Junhao!

241
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,280
Hello?

242
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:23,800
Someone is injured.

243
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,280
Darn it!

244
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:27,350
Ye Qianyu is way out of the line!

245
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,680
She didn’t answer my call.

246
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:32,190
They’re on a date.

247
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:33,680
Can’t you give them some space?

248
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,520
It’s 11 p.m. She isn’t back yet.

249
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,430
What is she thinking?

250
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:40,230
Are they going to be out all night?

251
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:42,190
How dare they!

252
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:47,400
Chen,

253
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,110
your daughter will leave the nest eventually.

254
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,190
Try Tonghao’s number!

255
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:05,470
- Hurry! - Move!

256
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,040
This way.

257
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,430
Make a way.

258
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:09,880
Junhao!

259
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:11,710
Hurry!

260
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:12,560
Junhao!

261
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:12,950
Careful.

262
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:15,310
Hurry. Go to the ER.

263
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:16,040
- Yes. - Yes.

264
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,430
- They need immediate treatment! - Hurry!

265
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:28,070
ER is this way.

266
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,000
Careful.

267
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:33,660
Slowly.

268
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,430
Tonghao didn’t pick up his phone.

269
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,880
Are they in trouble?

270
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,760
My heart is racing.

271
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:56,000
They are adults.

272
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,160
What could happen?

273
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,280
Don’t scare yourself.

274
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,710
Shengzhe, keeping dialing.

275
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,950
Don’t stop.

276
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:17,220
= Chen Shengzhe =

277
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:26,950
Tonghao! You finally picked up!

278
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,350
You brat!

279
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,640
Where did you take Qianyu?

280
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,070
It’s late! Where are you?

281
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,760
You are...

282
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,710
Chen Jinzhi.

283
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,110
Where’s Tonghao?

284
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,590
Who are you?

285
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:42,590
I’m Xu Ziqian.

286
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,110
Xu Ziqian?

287
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:47,830
Hey,

288
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:50,160
how come Tonghao’s phone is in your hands?

289
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,070
Where is he?

290
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:52,400
Tong...

291
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,710
Something happened to Junhao.

292
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,190
Who’s Junhao?

293
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,070
Junhao is Tonghao.

294
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,070
I don’t get a word you said.

295
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,760
Did you see Ye Qianyu?

296
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:09,110
She’s out with him all day.

297
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,110
They’re both injured

298
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,280
and in No.1 Hospital now.

299
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,470
What?

300
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,560
I don’t know the details

301
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,110
and I’ve already called the police.

302
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,430
Mom. Is everything OK?

303
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,430
Qianyu.

304
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:27,800
Ziqian.

305
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,520
- Aunt Jiang. - How’s Junhao?

306
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,070
He’s still in surgery.

307
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:36,800
Why another car accident?

308
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,920
Please bless him.

309
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:43,040
He’s just come back to me.

310
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,590
Aunt Jiang,

311
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,590
don’t worry.

312
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,560
Junhao will be fine.

313
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,640
How did this happen?

314
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:52,590
Don’t know.

315
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:54,920
Doesn’t seem to be an accident.

316
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:57,070
I’ll get to the bottom of it.

317
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,640
Doctor,

318
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,880
how’s my son?

319
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,400
The surgery succeeded.

320
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:06,590
The patient is stable.

321
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,040
He’ll be fine after some rest.

322
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:09,920
However,

323
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,230
his hippocampus

324
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,110
was severely damaged before.

325
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,070
He’s suffering from a memory disorder,

326
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:17,430
so it takes time for him to recover.

327
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:21,520
Thanks.

328
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:23,050
- You’re welcome. - Thank you.

329
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,400
Mom.

330
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,430
Thank goodness,

331
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,070
he’s fine.

332
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,210
Chen.

333
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:00,760
Shengzhe.

334
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:03,430
You’re awake.

335
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,230
How do you feel?

336
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:25,400
Junhao.

337
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:30,880
Junhao.

338
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,000
Junhao.

339
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:39,190
Junhao.

340
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:43,520
Junhao.

341
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,920
How do you feel?

342
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,640
Mom.

343
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,560
Yes.

344
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:01,400
It’s me.

345
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,230
I’m your mom.

346
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:08,830
Ziqian.

347
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:12,800
Yunyi.

348
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,560
Junhao.

349
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:21,710
You remember me?

350
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,310
How could I forget about you?

351
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,590
What’s wrong?

352
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,830
What happened to me?

353
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:45,640
You had a car accident

354
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,000
and were taken to the hospital.

355
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,920
The doctor said

356
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:50,830
you’re fine.

357
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,350
Car accident?

358
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,590
Before the engagement banquet,

359
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:02,880
I went to pick up the ring.

360
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:06,070
On my way back to the hotel,

361
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:08,560
I was hit by a car,

362
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:15,160
and then fell into the sea.

363
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,040
What happened after that?

364
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,950
After that...

365
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,760
I don’t remember.

366
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,190
It doesn’t matter.

367
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,110
It’s OK.

368
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,760
Just take your time.

369
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,160
I’m glad you’re back.

370
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,560
That’s all that matters.

371
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,520
How do you feel?

372
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:55,710
Chen.

373
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,400
Where’s Tonghao?

374
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,560
You asked about him right after you woke up.

375
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:03,280
Aren’t you worried about yourself?

376
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,070
Tonghao was hit by a car.

377
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,000
I need to see him.

378
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:09,800
Hey,

379
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:11,310
you’re injured, too.

380
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,610
- What are you doing? - Chen!

381
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:13,760
Where’s Tonghao?

382
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,760
I’m fine.

383
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:15,520
You...

384
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,800
Let’s go.

385
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:22,800
Excuse me,

386
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:23,800
nurse.

387
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,160
Which room is Shan Junhao in?

388
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,880
Floor 6, VIP room.

389
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,340
This...

390
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,520
Yunyi.

391
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,270
I’m sorry.

392
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:49,040
I disappeared during our engagement.

393
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,880
You must’ve been under a lot of pressure.

394
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,560
I’m fine, Junhao.

395
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,880
It’s all over.

396
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,430
Now that you’re back,

397
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,560
we can enjoy our future together.

398
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:42,590
If you get your memories back one day,

399
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,350
maybe you will forget everything here.

400
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,400
Past is passed.

401
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,350
What we need is to command the present

402
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:52,760
and live a good life today.

403
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,040
Qianyu.

404
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:58,070
All my memory

405
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,680
is about Guanmei and you.

406
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,160
Even if my memory will recover one day,

407
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,800
I will not leave here,

408
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:06,710
or leave you.

409
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:24,160
When true love appears,

410
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:27,160
this ring will lock your finger

411
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,760
and can never be taken off.

412
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,710
We belong to different worlds.

413
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,040
You should go home.

414
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,310
Your family is waiting for you.

415
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:38,920
I won’t.

416
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:40,190
I won’t leave you.

417
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,640
I only want to be with you.

418
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,000
Tonghao,

419
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,950
perhaps,

420
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:06,640
this is our fate.

421
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:09,430
Tonghao,

422
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:12,320
I love you.

423
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:35,360
What’s up?

424
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:36,280
Mom.

425
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,000
Where’s my dad?

426
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:52,230
Ziqian.

427
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,040
Where’s he?

428
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,560
While you were away,

429
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,120
many things happened.

430
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,560
Your father...

431
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:11,560
What happened?

432
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,520
Your father

433
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,630
passed away.

434
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,850
- Junhao! - Junhao!

435
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:23,610
Junhao!

436
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:24,950
Junhao!

437
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:25,800
Calm down.

438
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:27,150
No, he didn’t.

439
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,580
No.

440
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:29,840
- Junhao! - Dad.

441
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:30,390
Junhao!

442
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:31,470
Junhao!

443
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:32,760
Calm down.

444
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:34,870
- It’s OK, Junhao! - Junhao!

445
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,160
- Calm down! - Don’t be like this, Junhao!

446
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:38,760
Calm down.

447
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:41,280
- Dad didn’t die! - Junhao!

448
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:42,630
Junhao!

449
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:49,560
Mom.

450
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,840
Junhao’s been sedated.

451
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:55,320
He’s fine.

452
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:56,600
Don’t worry.

453
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,390
Mrs. Shan.

454
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:03,390
Miss Yunyi.

455
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,520
What about these clothes?

456
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,670
Throw them away.

457
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:11,190
He won’t wear them again.

458
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:12,040
By the way,

459
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:13,390
I found this photo

460
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:15,630
in his pocket.

461
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,800
You may leave.

462
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:33,390
Get rid of it.

463
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,120
Don’t let Junhao see it again.

464
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:42,670
I’m fine, Mom.

465
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:45,120
Junhao is back

466
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:47,950
and doesn’t remember things happened in Guanmei.

467
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:51,040
All this is a pure accident.

468
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:52,870
It won’t affect our relationship.

469
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:57,760
Darling,

470
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,120
you shouldn’t have suffered this.

471
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,630
Luckily,

472
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,710
Junhao is back safe and sound.

473
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,320
Look,

474
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,080
I’m on your side

475
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,230
and I’ll make you two marry soon

476
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:12,430
to avoid further trouble.

477
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,000
Here. Have an orange.

478
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:32,670
Fine.

479
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,280
What about an apple? Eat it.

480
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,120
Heaven played a cruel joke on Ye Qianyu.

481
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,750
Come in.

482
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:55,910
Director Xu.

483
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,360
Did I interrupt anything?

484
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,360
No.

485
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,430
You...

486
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,430
I’d like to have a word with Ye Qianyu alone.

487
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:08,470
Is that OK?

488
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,430
Sure. Sure.

489
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:23,870
Director Xu.

490
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,870
Sorry, I wronged you last time.

491
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,800
Junhao is awake.

492
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:39,630
I know.

493
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,230
I have no idea

494
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,600
what happened between you in Guanmei,

495
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:49,910
but

496
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,710
now that Junhao is back,

497
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,470
your past should be left behind.

498
00:38:59,080 --> 00:38:59,520
I suggest

499
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,320
you don’t see each other again.

500
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:05,760
Why?

501
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:09,040
Junhao is the GM of Senwell

502
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,080
and Fan Yunyi’s fiancé.

503
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,120
Who are you to him and why should he

504
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:17,120
see you?

505
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:25,000
You fell in love with Tonghao,

506
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,000
not Shan Junhao.

507
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:31,470
Your encounter is a sheer accident.

508
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:33,670
In the end, you’ll have to

509
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:35,600
go back to your own tracks.

510
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:40,390
I know it sounds harsh,

511
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,230
but you have to face reality.

512
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,560
Did Shan Junhao send you here?

513
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,120
The accident

514
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:44,040
separated Dad and me forever.

515
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,950
The job was done poorly.

516
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,870
What if others find out?

517
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:05,910
Who knew they’d be so clumsy?

518
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:08,800
Did you pay them?

519
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,320
I had to.

520
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:11,560
If they leaked it out,

521
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:12,870
it’d be a bigger disaster.

522
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,080
Hey, I have to say,

523
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,520
you should be more discreet.

524
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:19,760
Our interests are on the line,

525
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:20,630
understand?

526
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:21,560
Yes.

527
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,840
Mr. Qiu. Mr. Lin.

528
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:25,190
Why are you acting suspiciously

529
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:26,430
outside my office?

530
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,800
We’re waiting for you.

531
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:39,560
Mr. Zhang,

532
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,800
the Shans have announced

533
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,040
that Shan Junhao is back from abroad.

534
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,670
What should we do?

535
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,730
What’s to worry?

536
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:55,000
Once he’s back to Senwell,

537
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,800
he won’t allow others

538
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:58,390
to take his position.

539
00:41:59,040 --> 00:41:59,870
Do you have any solution?

540
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,470
Relax.

541
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,390
The board’s got our back.

542
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:06,040
Shan Junhao can’t change anything.

543
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:08,840
As long as you two don’t cause me trouble.

544
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,230
How could we?

545
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,280
We’ve been

546
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:14,230
on your side all along.

547
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:24,150
Mr. Zhang.

548
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:26,390
I heard you took advantage of my absence

549
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,840
and did tons of dirty deeds.

550
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:39,000
Mr. Former Manager,

551
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,520
I heard your so-called research overseas

552
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:42,910
was quite mysterious.

553
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,390
You know Senwell’s stock price

554
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:45,710
plunged?

555
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,120
Without me,

556
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:48,710
Senwell would’ve been dead by now.

557
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:51,800
You took advantage of my mother’s softness

558
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,280
and took over the company.

559
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,600
Don’t sugarcoat it.

560
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,800
I did everything for Senwell.

561
00:42:58,910 --> 00:42:59,840
Don’t forget

562
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,870
I’m still the largest shareholder.

563
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:03,800
Don’t you forget

564
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:06,420
the board elected me to be the general manager.

565
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,990
Now that I’m back,

566
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:10,840
everything will return to normal.

567
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:12,950
Shan Junhao,

568
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,560
you disappeared all of a sudden

569
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,760
and popped out from nowhere.

570
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,800
This isn’t a peekaboo.

571
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,670
I’ll call for a board meeting

572
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,080
to re-elect the general manager.

573
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:24,910
Fine.

574
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:27,470
Bring it on.

575
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:54,480
♪ Distance between us ♪

576
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:02,870
