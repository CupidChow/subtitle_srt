Look, I’ve revised these documents.

12

Hmm. OK. Give them to me.

13
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,120
Send to you later.

14
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,440
Is Mr. Shan back?

15
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,590
Mr. Taichu, Mr. Shan hasn’t come back yet.

16
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:58,860
Please review this document again.

17
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,900
- OK. - I’ll go fix the seal.

18
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:00,820
OK.

19
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,660
Mr. Shan,

20
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:02,860
lots of journalists are out there.

21
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,860
Let’s go to the underground garage.

22
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,910
There Shun Junhao is!

23
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,880
- Look. - There he is. He’s out.

24
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:22,440
Mr. Shan! Mr. Shan!

25
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,470
Mr. Shan!

26
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,650
Mr. Shan!

27
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:25,680
You have to answer us.

28
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,230
What are you going to do next?

29
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,520
Can you explain the fight?

30
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,430
Please answer me.

31
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,220
Mr. Shan!

32
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,210
Mr. Shan!

33
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,540
Mr. Shan! Mr. Shan!

34
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,490
Don’t go, Mr. Shan!

35
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,490
- Mr. Shan!
- Your comment, please, Mr. Shan!

36
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,000
Qianyu.

37
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,190
- Taichu. - He’s so handsome!

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,080
Have you handed the video to Shan Junhao?

39
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,390
He hasn’t shown up.

40
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,880
I can only give it to him tomorrow.

41
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,670
All right.

42
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,670
Come on. Let me drive you home.

43
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,240
There is no other way.

44
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:22,270
We have to apologize in public

45
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,360
to recover Senwell’s loss.

46
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,080
Yes, Junhao.

47
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,520
I know you never lowered your head to anyone.

48
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,240
But for the company,

49
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,520
you have to.

50
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,470
Mom,

51
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,960
don’t you say no work at home?

52
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:39,190
But this is different.

53
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,960
Do you know how bad it is?

54
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,000
You have to consider the greater good.

55
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,800
My department has initiated crisis management.

56
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,670
But it’s important that you have to show up.

57
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,160
Are you done with it?

58
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,960
I said I wouldn’t apologize.

59
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:59,000
Indeed, Junhao doesn’t need to apologize.

60
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,880
I believe those who have sharp eyes

61
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,750
must know it has to be something else.

62
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,910
To have made the aloof Shan Junhao lose control,

63
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,320
it mustn’t be something simple.

64
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,110
No one who has sense

65
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,070
would be fooled by the celebrity gossips.

66
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,350
But most people

67
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,480
believe what they saw and the result.

68
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,640
If Senwell’s image is damaged,

69
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,830
corporate management will be hard to maintain.

70
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,040
A public apology

71
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,480
is the best solution to reduce negative impact.

72
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,160
No gesture is kind of a gesture, too.

73
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,670
It stands for Senwell’s

74
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:31,790
and Shan Junhao’s

75
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,550
resolution to give no tolerance

76
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,110
to malicious slanders.

77
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,160
Leave the incident and the reason

78
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,830
for the PR Department to explain.

79
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,200
But this event…

80
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,040
Enough.

81
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,760
Let’s listen to Junhao.

82
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,270
He’ll make his decision.

83
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,000
You’re back!

84
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,820
- You’re back. - I’m back.

85
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,040
Chen, you picked up money?

86
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,950
What’s with the feast?

87
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,390
Thank you for the surprise lunch.

88
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,510
She wanted to be nicer to you.

89
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,390
Sit down and have dinner.

90
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,200
Mama Jinzhi,

91
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,600
your cooking is as good as usual.

92
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,440
Have more if you like it.

93
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,950
Do you know?

94
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,270
Shan Junhao hit the headline

95
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,670
due to the fight.

96
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,720
Lots of people cursed him.

97
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,390
An arrogant man like him

98
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,440
should feel people’s wrath.

99
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,720
Xie Quan stirred up the trouble.

100
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,230
Were it me,

101
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:14,200
I would give him hell of a lesson.

102
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,000
You…

103
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:17,830
Remember what he did to you?

104
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,160
Why speaking for him?

105
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,550
Ye Qianyu,

106
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,320
you can’t put a foot on two boats.

107
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,390
Two boats?

108
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:34,510
There’s only half a boat now.

109
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,550
What’s wrong with her?

110
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:11,000
Chief Xie, I’m sorry for you.

111
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:14,920
Mr. Qin,

112
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,550
look at my wound.

113
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,550
It’s too big a price to pay.

114
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,160
I won’t let you suffer for nothing.

115
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,040
Goddamned Shan Junhao!

116
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,320
I won’t let him get away from this.

117
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,390
Neither will I.

118
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:40,640
To the exposure of Shan Junhao’s brutality,

119
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,350
a toast.

120
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,230
OK.

121
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,390
Mr. Shan, come in please.

122
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,590
There’s stain on the glass.

123
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,150
Wipe it away.

124
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,030
OK, I’ll take care of it now.

125
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,080
This fragrance bottle doesn’t go

126
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,150
with the room.

127
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:44,880
Replace it.

128
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,520
OK, right away.

129
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:02,910
Mr. Shan,

130
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:05,320
our stock price hits the daily limit.

131
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,080
Development, Operation, and Publicity

132
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,150
are totally out of control.

133
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,200
Tell the directors to deal with it.

134
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,840
Don’t dump the problems to me.

135
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,350
Chen, don’t worry.

136
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,590
The food is good here.

137
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,030
I’ll take care of myself.

138
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,150
The workload is heavy.

139
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,200
But,

140
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,320
I’m a highly regarded

141
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,150
manager in Senwell.

142
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,150
With great power comes great responsibility.

143
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,960
I’ll take care of myself.

144
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,790
Silly girl.

145
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,880
When could you learn to be honest?

146
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,230
Are you a manager in Senwell?

147
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:56,470
Mr. Shan.

148
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,960
Cheating is your professional skill.

149
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,280
What’s wrong with it?

150
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,200
I never hurt anyone.

151
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,590
Unlike you,

152
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,440
you beat another up.

153
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,110
It isn’t new that dog bites people.

154
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,910
But the contrary is.

155
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,910
No wonder you hit the headline.

156
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,840
You can’t go.

157
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,760
Move!

158
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,320
Hold on.

159
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,280
I have an important thing to show you.

160
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,080
Mr. Shan!

161
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,400
Mr. Shan!

162
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,280
Look,

163
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,790
now we have this video,

164
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,080
we can unveil Xie Quan

165
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:46,150
so everyone can see his evilness.

166
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:47,960
We?

167
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,200
I’ve shown you such an important video.

168
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,910
You should smile.

169
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,760
At least you look easy-going when you smile.

170
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,640
Senwell pays great attention to clients’ privacy.

171
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,550
Do not film in dark again.

172
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,670
You’re welcome.

173
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,470
I think you should apologize,

174
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,520
but in an unusual way.

175
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:14,710
Unusual like how?

176
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:31,790
Mr. Li,

177
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:33,400
what are you doing?

178
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,350
Um… Nothing.

179
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,640
Look,

180
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,790
the door is so dirty.

181
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,330
- What’s wrong with the cleaning? - Oh!

182
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:42,160
I remember no one

183
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,640
checks in this room.

184
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,520
I have the card key.

185
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:45,470
Let’s open it and check out.

186
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,470
Joey.

187
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,670
You, um… Go back to work.

188
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,110
Morning, Mr. Shan.

189
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,000
Mr. Shan, you can make it.

190
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,840
Ye Qianyu,

191
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:16,150
what were you doing in there with Mr. Shan?

192
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:26,960
Dawei,

193
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,790
tell the Publicity Department

194
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,520
to organize a press conference immediately.

195
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:31,880
OK.

196
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:37,670
Junhao, you sure you want to apologize in public?

197
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:40,280
What makes you change your mind?

198
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,280
The press conference isn’t for an apology.

199
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,760
Then what is it for?

200
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,280
Go get ready.

201
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,320
I have work to do.

202
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,500
= Press Conference =

203
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,550
If he didn’t come,

204
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,590
Senwell would be doomed.

205
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:12,910
If he apologizes,

206
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,550
it will hit the headline.

207
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,030
- It sure will. - I’m certain.

208
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:18,320
It’s gonna be a great show.

209
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,550
What is Junhao going to say?

210
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,470
You’ll know in a while.

211
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,250
- Go over the questions. - Hmm, OK.

212
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:02,910
Thank you for coming to this conference

213
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,110
on short notice.

214
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:08,590
My conflict with Mr. Xie Quan three days ago

215
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,520
has stirred up a confusion

216
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,000
to both the public and Senwell Group.

217
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:13,400
Therefore,

218
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,960
I’d like to give my sincere apology to you all.

219
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,200
But to Xie Quan,

220
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,400
I think the apology is unnecessary.

221
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,030
Why is the apology unnecessary?

222
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:48,790
Didn’t he just apologize?

223
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,400
Why telling us it’s unnecessary?

224
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,790
Let’s see what he’s going to say.

225
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,640
Shan Junhao,

226
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,840
what do you mean?

227
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,110
You injured me so bad.

228
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,710
Now you want to disclaim responsibility?

229
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:20,520
As a renowned media professional,

230
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,200
you blackmailed your interviewee

231
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,790
and harassed our female employee.

232
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,280
You deserve it.

233
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:33,230
So it’s a dirty deal.

234
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:35,020
It is a filthy deal.

235
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:36,840
= Xie Quan, =

236
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:40,760
= we paid 270,000 RMB
for the wine you ordered yesterday. =

237
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,840
= Now, you ask for 500,000? =

238
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,390
= You’re utterly unethical! =

239
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,710
How could he do that?

240
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,550
I believe

241
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,470
you’ve found out the details about the incident.

242
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,400
Either I’m right or wrong,

243
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,000
it’s your call.

244
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:58,550
Senwell always values honesty

245
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,710
and pursues perfection.

246
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,550
To serve you with all our hearts

247
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,670
is our mission.

248
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,520
However,

249
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,080
we won’t allow anyone

250
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,670
to slander and defame us maliciously.

251
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:10,520
You…

252
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:12,710
You made up the story!

253
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,840
As to why Xie Quan did that,

254
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,670
I believe he owes you an explanation.

255
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,790
Is what he said true?

256
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:27,910
Please explain it.

257
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:30,540
Don’t you think

258
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,010
it’s against your professional ethics?

259
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,910
Can you explain to us?

260
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,350
What are you going to say to your fans?

261
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,200
Did something similar happen in the past?

262
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,570
- Your explanation, please. - Explain to us.

263
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:42,030
Chief Xie, please give us an explanation.

264
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,590
Do you feel no guilt

265
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:45,610
about the beating incident?

266
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:47,850
Do you have any comment about the video?

267
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,320
What are you going to say to Senwell Group?

268
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,150
Please explain.

269
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,860
Chief Xie, do you want to make an explanation

270
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,390
about this incident?

271
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:58,300
Chief Xie.

272
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,180
You owe us an explanation.

273
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,950
What are you going to say to Senwell Group?

274
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,170
How long have you been doing this?

275
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,190
♪ I found a coin by the road ♪

276
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:11,920
♪ And gave it to the police ♪

277
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,640
♪ The police took the coin and nodded to me ♪

278
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,800
Ye Qianyu!

279
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Ye Qianyu,

280
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:22,800
as an employee of Senwell Hotel,

281
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,470
you need to pay attention

282
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:26,310
to your image like I do all the time.

283
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,680
You know?

284
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,950
Yes, manager.

285
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,400
I’ll pay attention to it.

286
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,590
Mr. Li.

287
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,110
Ye Qianyu,

288
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:38,400
Mr. Shan asks you to go
to the headquarters after work.

289
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:41,280
Ye Qianyu.

290
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,320
What did you do wrong this time?

291
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,020
Nothing.

292
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,260
Ye Qianyu didn’t do anything wrong.

293
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,470
On the contrary, she made a great contribution.

294
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:50,190
The video on the press conference

295
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,350
is filmed by her.

296
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,470
Wait for you at the gate after work.

297
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:11,800
Qianyu.

298
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,710
Taichu.

299
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:18,560
Where are you going?

300
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:20,880
Mr. Shan asks Ye Qianyu to go to the headquarters.

301
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:23,520
I think he wants to express his gratitude.

302
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:26,560
Go ahead.

303
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,520
I’m gonna go now.

304
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:28,760
Bye-bye.

305
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,110
Bye-bye.

306
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,430
Come in.

307
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,430
Mr. Shan, you want to see me?

308
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,760
Why do you still wear the sad face?

309
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,560
Shouldn’t we celebrate it?

310
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,070
Celebrate?

311
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:13,020
Who wants to celebrate with you?

312
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,070
You’re very grateful to me now, aren’t you?

313
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,310
I can consider a salary raise.

314
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,880
Never mind a promotion.

315
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,160
I want to hone my skills

316
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,310
in my current position.

317
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,430
Gosh!

318
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,230
I didn’t know you could smile!

319
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,800
Why did you film that video?

320
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,000
I thought you were cute

321
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,430
when you fought.

322
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,640
Cute?

323
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,350
Yes.

324
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,710
People like you

325
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:01,680
don’t blink in front of a catastrophe.

326
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,280
You’re like a moving iceberg every day.

327
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,590
I couldn’t believe you would beat someone.

328
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,560
Kind of brutal,

329
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,400
but it’s something we would do.

330
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,760
It’s not just my opinion.

331
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,830
Whose else?

332
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,640
Didn’t you see the comments on the Internet?

333
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:21,310
You’re the idol of countless girls now.

334
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,590
Why do you always drink up?

335
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,640
You can’t drink it like that.

336
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,400
I just want to gulp

337
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,920
the expensive wine!

338
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,070
Yunyi,

339
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,430
I selected out a few invitation designs.

340
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,310
Which one do you like?

341
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,350
They’re all beautiful.

342
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:11,770
What’s up?

343
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,820
Mom, I’m fine.

344
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,640
What time is it now?

345
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,880
Why hasn’t Junhao come home?

346
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,160
Each time in a crisis,

347
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:29,400
I turn the tide.

348
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,560
Tell me.

349
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,230
Am I right?

350
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,160
Oh gosh!

351
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:37,760
You always wear the long face,

352
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,830
like I owe you something.

353
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:41,800
When you pass by,

354
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:45,190
the temperature drops so drastically

355
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:49,160
that air freezes, dude!

356
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,190
Ye Qianyu,

357
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,330
you’re drunk.

358
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,950
No, I’m not!

359
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,280
- Yes, you are. - Come on, let’s drink.

360
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,320
- No more. - Come on.

361
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,070
- Drink it! - No. No more.

362
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,190
Yes or no?

363
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,640
No.

364
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,230
Yes or no?

365
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,430
No!

366
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:32,470
Yes or no?

367
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,230
What are you doing?

368
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,710
Yes or no?

369
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,640
Hand off!

370
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,190
Yes or no?

371
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:41,920
No.

372
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,350
Yes or no?

373
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:46,040
Yes.

374
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:48,680
Yes, I’ll drink.

375
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,300
Yes.

376
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,350
OK?

377
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:54,040
Drink the bottle.

378
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:14,470
Good boy!

379
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:15,160
I did it.

380
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,190
You haven’t drunk yet.

381
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,950
Tonghao.

382
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,950
You’re finally back.

383
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,590
Smile, OK?

384
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,920
You look handsome when you smile.

385
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,110
Ye Qianyu,

386
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,110
do you often drink so much with strangers?

387
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:13,230
You’re not a stranger.

388
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,590
You’re Tonghao,

389
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:19,520
whom I like the most.

390
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,700
= Yunyi =

391
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,580
= Yunyi =

392
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,430
Maybe he’s busy.

393
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:58,040
Look at these.

394
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,760
Ye Qianyu.

395
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,100
= Junhao =

396
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,830
Hello, Junhao?

397
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:42,760
Are you still working?

398
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,190
I don’t know how long it might take.

399
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,430
Go to sleep.

400
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,710
Don’t wait up.

401
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:55,680
Don’t work too late.

402
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,080
Health matters the most.

403
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,600
Hmm. Got it.

404
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:01,950
When I finish the work,

405
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:03,240
I’ll go home.

406
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,090
Hmm.

407
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:09,520
Am I right?

408
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:13,230
It’s a good thing that a man devotes to work.

409
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:17,230
Work?

410
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:21,350
Am I your work?

411
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:24,760
Is drinking your work, too?

412
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,830
Ye Qianyu,

413
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,160
you’re so horrible.

414
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,950
Horrible?

415
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,680
I’m cute, all right?

416
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,760
Come on. Let me send you home.

417
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,520
No!

418
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:48,400
I haven’t spoken my mind.

419
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,680
What do you want to say?

420
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,830
Tonghao,

421
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,190
are you happy after you came back?

422
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,160
No one has ever asked me that question.

423
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,830
I wish I lose my memory, too.

424
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,350
Then I wouldn’t miss you so much,

425
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,640
nor feel sad bacause of you.

426
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:37,590
But I don’t want to forget you.

427
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,000
Ye Qianyu,

428
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:44,280
I’m not Tonghao.

429
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:48,380
Yes, you’re Tonghao.

430
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,810
Tonghao is here.

431
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,920
I see him.

432
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:03,400
Hey,

433
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,560
what is it that you want?

434
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:11,000
Why do you always intervene in my life?

435
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:15,710
I just want you to be happy.

436
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,400
Don’t worry.

437
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,760
Whatever happens,

438
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:27,070
I’ll be on your back.

439
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,430
I’m neither happy nor unhappy in my life.

440
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,950
Because everything is in my control.

441
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:41,400
I don’t like it to get out of track

442
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:44,800
or to fall apart.

443
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,560
But…

444
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:20,590
Thank you.

445
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,350
Ye Qianyu.

446
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,070
Hello, Mama Jinzhi?

447
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,160
Taichu, is Qianyu with you?

448
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:49,830
She didn’t answer my calls.

449
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,920
She isn’t at my place.

450
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:54,410
Strange! Where can she go?

451
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:56,200
She hasn’t come home at this hour.

452
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,000
She’s working overtime.

453
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:01,760
But, don’t worry, Mama Jinzhi.

454
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,230
I’m waiting for her down the office building.

455
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,590
Take care of her.

456
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,520
OK, bye-bye.

457
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,800
Qianyu.

458
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,390
Taichu.

459
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:30,870
It’s late.

460
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:32,190
Whom are you waiting for?

461
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,560
Who else except you?

462
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:37,670
You’ve been waiting for me?

463
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,470
What took you so long up there?

464
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,630
And you drank wine?

465
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,000
Shan Junhao invited me to a drink

466
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,280
to express his gratitude.

467
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,120
Oh.

468
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:57,360
I’m so sorry.

469
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,000
I don’t know you’re waiting for me.

470
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:01,390
It’s OK.

471
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,430
It’s late. Let me give you a lift.

472
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:05,840
Thank you.

473
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,710
Let’s go.

474
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:23,150
At a time like this, he needs us to squash it.

475
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,670
But Shan Junhao is so cold-blooded.

476
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:31,710
He never said thank you.

477
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:41,670
Taichu,

478
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,190
you’re taking the wrong way.

479
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:45,080
This isn’t the way to Guanmei Fishing Village.

480
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:48,080
We’re not going back to Guanmei.

481
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:49,600
Where are we going then?

482
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,230
My place.

483
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:56,150
Chen will be worried if I don’t go home.

484
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,040
It’s 2 in the morning.

485
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,840
And you have to go to work today.

486
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,280
Don’t worry.

487
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:04,080
I’ve talked to Mama Jinzhi.

488
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:07,230
All right.

489
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,710
There’s a woman in your home?

490
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:33,840
These are prepared for you, OK?

491
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,020
Oh.

492
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,710
Change your shoes.

493
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:51,560
Towel, pajamas.

494
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,560
These are prepared specially for you, too.

495
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,710
Thank you.

496
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,150
Go take a shower.

497
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,390
There’s a toothbrush for you.

498
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:01,520
It’s ugly.

499
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,430
Your office is so cold.

500
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:13,280
Let the frog be your company.

501
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,320
It used to be Tonghao’s best friend, too.

502
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,390
Mr. Shan,

503
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,320
you don’t need to work like a dog.

504
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,280
Junhao,

505
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:59,190
you’re about to get married with Yunyi.

506
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:03,820
I know.

507
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,000
Junhao.

508
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,600
You slept in the office last night?

509
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:29,190
I was too tired from work

510
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,150
and I fell asleep.

511
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,150
You drank wine?

512
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,360
With whom?

513
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,630
I…

514
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,430
With Dawei.

515
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,080
Dawei is unbelievable!

516
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,080
Ziqian,

517
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,600
what is it you want to say?

518
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,280
Comments about yesterday’s press conference
are positive.

519
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,840
I suggest we do more of such interviews.

520
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,320
It’s instrumental to improve our image.

521
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,000
Put the work aside.

522
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,950
Junhao,

523
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:17,390
go home and have some rest.

524
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,580
Let’s go.

525
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,390
Mr. Shan.

526
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,360
Dawei,

527
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:36,080
you failed to take good care of Mr. Shan

528
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:37,710
and you left his bad habit unchecked.

529
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:40,000
How could his body stand it
if it goes on like this?

530
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:40,950
I…

531
00:40:57,230 --> 00:41:00,080
Director Fan, I’m sorry. It’s my fault.

532
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:01,630
Are you sober now?

533
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,560
Almost.

534
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:09,280
Send Mr. Shan home for some rest.

535
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,080
OK.

536
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:12,480
Mr. Shan.

537
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:15,630
It’s OK.

538
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,150
It’s already working time.

539
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:20,670
Go back to work.

540
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:21,950
I’m not going home.

541
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,430
I’ll leave you.

542
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,710
Why is there a stuffed frog?

543
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,600
I also want to know.

544
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:49,320
A gift from an employee.

545
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,630
An employee?

546
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:53,190
Who is it?

547
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:57,520
The one who filmed the video.

548
00:41:57,950 --> 00:41:58,820
Oh, that one.

549
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:01,100
She must be your fan, Junhao.

550
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:05,230
But the frog doesn’t go with your air.

551
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:13,150
All right.

552
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,040
Go back to your work.

553
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:29,000
What’s wrong with Ziqian?

554
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:35,000
You, too. Back to work.

555
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,290
OK.

556
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:49,120
Crap! Crap! I’m late.

557
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:49,910
There she is.

558
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:50,600
Qianyu,

559
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,600
you saved Senwell from the crisis.

560
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:53,500
Right.

561
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,260
Thanks to the video you filmed,

562
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:56,570
many of those cancelled rooms

563
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:58,720
are rebooked.

564
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,360
Forgive me, manager.

565
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:14,150
I’m late because I was occupied.

566
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:16,670
