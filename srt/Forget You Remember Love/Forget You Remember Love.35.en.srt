Thanks.

15

You’ve been in your room after dinner.

16
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,480
What are you doing?

17
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,960
I’m making a resume,

18
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,720
for tomorrow’s job interviews.

19
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,320
Are you really going to find a job?

20
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,760
Yes.

21

My mom and I can’t

22
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,750
be the freeloaders forever.

23
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,830
You’re not freeloaders.

24
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,320
You’ve been helping with my work.

25
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,000
You could do it well on your own.

26
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,810
Because they have Ye Qianyu,

27
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,360
Guanmei Inn is in good operation.

28
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,110
Money Bag Grocery has Tang’s help.

29
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,520
So I should get a job.

30
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,320
OK.

31
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,950
Good luck.

What could possibly be interesting in a resume?

No.

Let me see. Just a peek.

39

- No. - Give it to me.

40
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:07,950
Give it to me.

is with Senwell.

47

Where else?

48
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,600
You can include your experience in Guanmei Inn

49
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,670
in the resume.

50
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,360

May I help?

Come and fill in.

I…

55

If we weren’t short of a player,

56

do you think I would invite you?

I won’t go soft on you this time.

Do you think I’m gonna lose?

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,750
Loser.

62
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,880
Join us. Hurry.

63
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,720
Come on. Come on.

64
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,800
Coming. Coming.

65
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,280
- Here! Here! - Oh, my!

66
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:03,270
Don’t you have four players here?

67
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:05,800
Master is dumb.

68
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,070
He doesn’t know how to play.

69
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,180
Yes. Right.

70
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,680
- Come on. - Sit. Hurry.

71
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,820
- Sit. - Sit.

72
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:12,980
Sit.

73
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,320
Tiles have been sorted out.

74
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,440
Guys, we have a fat cat here.

75
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,920
So let’s scale up the wager.

76
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,480
- OK. - OK.

77
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,600
The loser drinks a glass of beer.

78
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,550
No, I can’t.

79
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,600
I can’t drink.

80
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,830
I haven’t finished yet.

81
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,760
Toilet is not allowed.

82
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,110
If you go to toilet, drink 3 more glasses.

83
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:34,430
Yeah, that’s right.

84
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,410
We’ve got beers.

85
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:40,220
Master makes dishes to go with the beer.

86
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,720
- Let the battle begin!
- Let the battle begin!

87
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,350
- The fat cat goes first. - You first.

88
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,670
All right.

89
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,490
- You draw first. - Go ahead.

90
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:01,630
Whoops!

91
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,670
- Let me see. - Whose turn is it?

92
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,380
Keep up. Keep up.

93
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,480
Don’t hurry me. Short arms.

94
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,440
Good one.

95
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,600
North Wind.

96
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,390
That’s your first to discard?

97
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:18,840
I’ll follow.

98
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,540
South Wind.

99
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,590
West Wind.

100
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:25,950
Same for me.

101
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,790
What is that you discarded?

102
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,270
Give me something I want.

103
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,060
- OK, OK. - Five Characters.

104
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,040
Next one.

105
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,170
That’s brilliant.

106
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,070
Give me a blow.

107
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,720
Since we were little,

108
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,390
I’ve watched you perform the magic many times,

109
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,270
yet I still don’t know how you make it.

110
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,200
As long as it makes you happy,

111
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,230
I’d like to play the trick forever.

112
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:34,510
If one chocolate

113
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,480
can make you happy,

114
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,480
will a jar of chocolates

115
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,720
make you happier?

116
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:56,600
Thanks.

117
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,920
Have some sleep.

118
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,440
Good night.

119
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,970
Good night.

120
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,320
Good night.

121
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:22,490
Good night.

122
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,480
Drumstick, give me self-drawn.

123
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,600
Hurry up.

124
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,050
Five Characters.

125
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,480
Two Circles.

126
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:00,510
Don’t cheat.

127
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,320
Five Circles.

128
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,510
Don’t discard Circles.

129
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,350
The next player is expecting it.

130
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,000
I win!

131
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,390
You know how to play, don’t you?

132
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:11,040
You can predict their tiles.

133
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:23,000
I watched all the time.

134
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,790
I learned it.

135
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,070
For the sake of your white lie,

136
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,880
drink this glass for me.

137
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,400
Another glass?

138
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,770
I…

139
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,520
I’ve drunk 8 glasses for you.

140
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,700
That’s what you’ve got for lying to me.

141
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,760
No, I can’t. I can’t hold it.

142
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,640
If you go to toilet now,

143
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,840
drink 3 glasses when you come back.

144
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,200
I really can’t… Can’t anymore!

145
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,460
No, no, no! That’s it!

146
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,150
I can’t!

147
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,030
Jinzhi,

148
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,280
I’m holding it like I’m pregnant.

149
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,280
Aunt Jinzhi,

150
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,230
is it bad for the kidneys

151
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,840
to keep a full bladder for long?

152
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,080
Either your kidneys are well or not,

153
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,080
Liyin won’t fall for you.

154
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,370
Jinzhi is right.

155
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,080
Shuffle the tiles.

156
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,910
- Come on. - Come on.

157
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,070
Come on.

158
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,920
You’re so annoying.

159
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,080
Shut up!

Mrs. Shan is still in bed.

163
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:07,000
It’s late.

164
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,960
Aunt Jiang used to get up early.

165
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,030
She played mahjong with us last night.

166
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,200
She was totally in it.

167
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,030
You’re amazing.

168
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,030
It’s your mom’s idea.

169
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,760
To cheer Aunt Jiang up,

170
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,550
Chen racks her brains.

171
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:27,960
Tonghao isn’t here.

172
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,520
He went out early.

173
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,150
We agreed that I’d send him to the interview.

174
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:36,670
Perhaps,

175
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,520
he didn’t want to bother you.

176
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,400
Fengqiao,

177
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,640
did you have breakfast?

178
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,880
No.

179
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,350
Make something for yourself in the kitchen.

180
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,320
Haven’t you made one more breakfast?

181
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,140
= Shan Junhao =

182
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,280
I never expected

183
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,030
that the renowned

184
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,440
General Manager of Senwell

185
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:13,200
would apply for our Development Director.

186
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,320
MQ Group

187
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,550
is one of the top 10 companies in this industry.

188
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,960
I have great respect

189
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,150
to your business model.

190
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:24,280
Moreover, Senwell and MQ

191
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,910
had lots of joint projects before.

192
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,440
So I know very well about your company.

193
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,110
Personally, I appreciate your capability.

194
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,280
Under your leadership,

195
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,030
Senwell has been the pioneer of the industry.

196
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,960
If you join MQ,

197
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,880
I believe you’ll help us

198
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,550
get on a new stage.

199
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,000
However,

200
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,840
before I met you,

201
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,910
I got a call.

202
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:48,200
If we hire you,

203
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,590
our cooperation with Senwell

204
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,470
will be terminated immediately.

205
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,550
Your conflict with Mr. Xu

206
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,320
is a sensation in this industry.

207
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:01,000
We’d rather look on,

208
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,350
than get involved.

209
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,200
I quite understand what you said.

210
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,470
Thanks for your time.

211
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,520
Thank you.

212
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,710
You’re Shan Junhao?

213
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,790
Senwell’s former General Manager?

214
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:38,840
Yes.

215
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,230
You’re truly a talent and handsome young man!

216
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,300
I’m flattered.

217
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:49,350
Is it true that your father

218
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,880
staged the yacht explosion

219
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,640
and murdered his partner?

220
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:57,320
Mr. Fu,

221
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,560
I come for a job interview.

222
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I know.

223
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,440
But I have to get a whole picture of you first.

224
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,030
If it’s true,

225
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,710
how could I have the nerve

226
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:09,640
to work with you?

227
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,280
Whether it’s in work,

228
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,280
or in family,

229
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,670
my father was an excellent man.

230
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,590
Thank you for your time.

231
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,590
Talk to me.

232
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:29,920
Mr. Luo,

233
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,420
Senwell.

234
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,040
Nice to meet you.

235
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,040
Be seated.

236
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:51,610
Director Liu.

237
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,960
This is our Vice President, Mr. Liu.

238
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,760
Shan Junhao.

239
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:58,280
I never expected we would meet again.

240
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,670
Moreover, it’s in the current situation.

241
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,840
What a coincidence!

242
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:05,150
When you fired me,

243
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,590
you were so indifferent and determined.

244
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,640
Unexpectedly, now you’re applying

245
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,640
for our Director of  Development Department.

246
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,320
Now the shoe

247
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,470
is on my foot.

248
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:20,640
So,

249
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,860
you just want to humiliate me

250
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,430
instead of hiring me,

251
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,290
right?

252
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,080
When I found your resume

253
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,470
among a pile of materials,

254
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,080
I was astonished.

255
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,000
I can’t resist the impulse

256
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,520
to see what the glamorous Shan Junhao

257
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,590
has become now.

258
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,670
Now you’ve seen me.

259
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,190
Happy?

260
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:42,830
Very.

261
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,350
So can I go now?

262
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,640
If you want to stay in here,

263
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,160
I have an offer.

264
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,590
You can

265
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,320
apply for my assistant.

266
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:55,930
Thanks.

267
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,960
The General Manager of Senwell Group, Shan Junhao.

268
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,170
- Come. Let’s go over there. - OK.

269
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,780
How is everything with work?

270
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,670
Not used to it?

271
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,020
Let’s take a seat here.

272
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:44,990
Do you mind?

273
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:45,770
No.

274
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:48,910
How is your foot?

275
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,240
- Still hurts? - It’s OK.

276
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,680
- Look, there are boats over there.
- Let’s buy boba.

277
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:55,340
OK, let’s go there now.

278
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:01,070
Let me buy some drinks.

279
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:12,620
= Qianyu =

280
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:15,640
Qianyu.

281
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,400
How is the interview going?

282
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,550
It goes well.

283
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,680
Don’t worry about me.

284
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:27,210
Glad to hear.

285
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,960
Remember to come back early.

286
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,150
Rest assured.

287
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,920
I will.

288
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:35,230
Waiting for you at Guanmei Inn.

289
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,200
- Bye. - Let’s go have pizza.

290
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,230
He said everything goes well.

291
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,590
- OK. - A talent like him

292
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,600
is like hot cakes on the market.

293
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,150
What if no company wants him?

294
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,760
Sometimes,

295
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:56,230
a small company can’t afford such a genius,

296
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:58,200
and the big ones

297
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,320
already have theirs.

298
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,550
It’s hard to say.

299
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,880
Besides, you show high expectation

300
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,350
towards him.

301
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:05,400
If he couldn’t meet your expectation,

302
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:07,640
his ego will be hurt.

303
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,760
So my sweet girl,

304
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,400
the most important thing

305
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,190
is for us to face reality

306
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,590
and learn to accept it.

307
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,020
Yes.

308
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:18,810
He’s an excellent man.

309
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:19,840
He’ll make it.

310
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,810
It’s late.

311
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:24,110
- He’s late each time. - It’s already 12:40.

312
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:24,970
Yeah.

313
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:27,230
He couldn’t do that even he’s the Chairman.

314
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:29,320
- Always late for the meeting. - Yes, right.

315
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,670
- Here he comes.
- He shows no respect to punctuality.

316
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:35,680
Right.

317
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,000
Chairman Xu,

318
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:46,190
you’re late for each meeting.

319
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:46,920
Shan Junhao

320
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,950
was never late.

321
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,310
Now, I am the General Manager.

322
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,230
I convene this board meeting

323
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,920
to make an announcement.

324
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:03,520
We’re going to cooperate with Marv

325
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:11,800
and start a national chain supermarket project.

326
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,830
The estimated investment is 10 billion yuan.

327
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,510
- 10 billion? - 10 billion?

328
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,190
Where are we going to get the money?

329
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:18,280
10 billion is too much for an investment!

330
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,190
Why are we working with Marv
on such a big project?

331
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:21,190
How could this be possible?

332
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:23,610
- Marv has been our competitor all along. - Yeah.

333
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:25,050
Why do you want to cooperate with them?

334
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,940
And on such a huge project?

335
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:28,800
The world is not always the enemy,

336
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,880
only perpetual interests.

337
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,560
As long as our interest is mutual,

338
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,560
we could reach temporary cooperation.

339
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,880
But I suppose we don’t have so much capital

340
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,350
to implement such a big project.

341
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,110
Hence,

342
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,000
there is the second announcement.

343
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:43,880
I’m going to allocate all our capitals

344
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,160
to this project.

345
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:49,310
Projects in Guanmei Fishing Village, St. Lucia,

346
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:51,040
Seychelles and Marrakesh

347
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,040
will be shut down.

348
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,680
Shut down?

349
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,230
Is that a joke?

350
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,640
The shutdown of so many projects

351
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,590
leads to piles of default, you know?

352
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,400
The default

353
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,830
will be recouped by the chain supermarket project.

354
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:10,070
I’ll lead the project personally.

355
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,590
So much for the meeting.

356
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,110
Gosh!

357
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,310
This is too rash.

358
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:21,400
How could we cooperate with Marv?

359
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,110
He just left like that.

360
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,310
Yunyi.

361
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,190
Ziqian.

362
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,560
You’re back so soon.

363
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,190
There isn’t much work to do in the company.

364
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:43,880
So I come back to keep you company.

365
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,160
These are for you.

366
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:48,110
My favorite white roses.

367
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:57,280
Ziqian,

368
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,520
because of me, you leave late and return early.

369
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,590
I’m a burden to you.

370
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,800
You’re never a burden.

371
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,400
As long as you’re happy,

372
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,280
I’d like to do anything for you.

373
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,880
Whether it’s happy,

374
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,640
or not happy,

375
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,190
this is what life is, isn’t it?

376
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:21,400
We’re meant to be happy in our lives.

377
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,590
I… I heard lately there’s

378
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:27,640
a new comedy movie in theatre.

379
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,710
Its box office is good.

380
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,350
Do you want to watch it?

381
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:32,710
We haven’t gone to the theatre for long.

382
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,950
I don’t want to go out.

383
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,560
Don’t you like painting?

384
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,400
Let’s paint Daisy together.

385
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,430
I haven’t painted for years.

386
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,950
I can’t anymore.

387
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,430
Let’s cook then.

388
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:01,800
We’ll make your favorite seafood sashimi.

389
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:03,560
Ziqian,

390
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,710
I know you try to cheer me up by all means.

391
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:09,350
But…

392
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,110
I feel empty inside.

393
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:14,920
I don’t want to do anything.

394
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:16,920
It’s OK.

395
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,230
We have plenty of time

396
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,040
to make it full.

397
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,190
What is Xu Ziqian thinking?

398
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,880
Keep a close eye on him.

399
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,480
Yes, Mr. Zhang.

400
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,730
Mr. Zhang,

401
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:48,230
why is the project of Guanmei Fishing Village

402
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:49,640
shut down?

403
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,230
Not only Guanmei Fishing Village,

404
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,310
all the ongoing projects

405
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,230
have been put to a halt.

406
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,190
What is going on?

407
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,520
I suggest you ask Chairman Xu about it.

408
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,230
I went to him just now.

409
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:04,830
But he’s left the company.

410
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:05,800
Again?

411
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,430
He’s seldom at the company,

412
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:09,880
and his heart too.

413
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,430
What are you going to explain to GQ Ventures?

414
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,680
Mr. Taichu,

415
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:21,350
I’ll talk to Chairman Xu again.

416
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,000
Please wait for my news.

417
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,590
Given the situation,

418
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,110
please don’t report to GQ for now.

419
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,590
Since Senwell makes such a bold move,

420
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:31,070
GQ will find out sooner or later.

421
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,040
Mr. Taichu,

422
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,160
I don’t care what your purpose is,

423
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,000
but at least we share the same goal

424
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,430
to advance this project.

425
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,160
So at such a time,

426
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,470
I hope you stand on my side.

427
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:07,800
You’re home.

428
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,590
How is your job hunting?

429
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,560
No suitable jobs so far.

430
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,110
There’s no need to haste.

431
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:22,040
Let’s keep looking tomorrow.

432
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,190
I think

433
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:28,040
I need to consider

434
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,520
where I should start

435
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,070
with my new life.

436
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,310
It’s OK.

437
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,800
Tonghao started from scratch, too.

438
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,590
So can you.

439
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:44,880
All of a sudden, I admire Tonghao.

440
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:48,760
Back then, Tonghao was

441
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,680
simple and optimistic.

442
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,710
Whatever Tonghao was equal to,

443
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:53,880
I believe you’re capable, too.

444
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:59,640
Because Tonghao is in Shan Junhao’s mind.

445
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:02,760
Did you have dinner?

446
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,800
I kept some for you.

447
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:04,760
Not yet.

448
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,230
I’m kind of hungry now.

449
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:08,430
Come for the dinner.

450
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,400
You made these?

451
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:23,710
Wait, where is my mom?

452
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,160
Aunt Jiang is on the second floor with my mom.

453
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,280
- Great one! - Three Bamboos.

454
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,880
Three Circles.

455
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,800
- Three Circles. - Right, sorry, sorry.

456
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,400
Two Bamboos.

457
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,350
Are you drunk?

458
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,280
Gosh!

459
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,520
One Circle. One Circle. Go away.

460
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:34,680
Hold on. Hold on. Wait!

461
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,470
What?

462
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:37,190
One Circle, right?

463
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:38,310
Yes, One Circle.

464
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,920
One Circle or Four Circles.

465
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,190
I win!

466
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,430
Chen,

467
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,120
you discarded that. You have to drink.

468
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,160
Your turn. Here.

469
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,590
All right. I’ll drink. Look.

470
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,060
Aunt Jinzhi, well done!

471
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,680
- Way to go! - Awesome!

472
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,280
Mama Jinzhi is brilliant.

473
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,680
Guanmei Inn

474
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,710
has become the elders’ entertainment center.

475
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:01,340
Have your dinner.

476
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,500
Try this.

477
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,560
It’s still warm.

478
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:08,910
A few more bites.

479
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,030
Dawei?

480
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,240
General Manager.

481
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:28,350
I’m not the General Manager anymore.

482
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:30,520
Right.

483
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,110
Junhao, how are you doing?

484
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:36,800
Great!

485
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,930
How are you doing after you left Senwell?

486
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,350
I’m the Manager of Development in Manco Company.

487
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,680
I heard something today.

488
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,400
I think I should let you know.

489
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:47,110
What is it?

490
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:49,190
I heard from a colleague in Senwell

491
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:50,430
that Chairman Xu

492
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:52,560
shuts down all the big projects,

493
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,470
including Guanmei Fishing Village,

494
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:56,190
and spares all resources on the development

495
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:57,680
of a chain supermarket project.

496
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,040
Why does he shut it down?

497
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,830
Doesn’t Senwell

498
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,070
want to renovate this area?

499
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,400
I don’t know the details.

500
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,000
But now in Senwell,

501
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,690
Chairman Xu is the dictator.

502
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,070
Even Mr. Zhang has no voice of any kind.

503
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,350
I don’ t believe

504
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:13,280
that’s what Ziqian could do.

505
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:17,000
He must have done it for a reason.

506
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,880
Now in Senwell,

507
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,680
everyone is anxious.

508
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,040
Lots of employees resigned lately.

509
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,110
The company didn’t even try to keep them.

510
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,110
I don’t work for Senwell now.

511
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,830
I can’t help with it.

512
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:36,070
I believe Ziqian must have his plan.

513
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,110
Junhao,

514
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:42,350
take care of yourself.

515
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:47,350
Don’t worry.

516
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,070
No matter where I am,

517
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,590
I can survive.

518
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,180
By the way,

519
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,040
where are the others?

520
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,160
Why are there only you?

521
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,680
They’re playing mahjong on the second floor.

522
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:05,430
I’m gonna go up and say hi.

523
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,560
I should leave you.

524
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,800
Have your dinner.

525
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,160
How do I solve this?

526
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,630
Well…

527
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,880
Why don’t you call your classmates?

528
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:25,070
You can’t help me with any of the problems.

529
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:26,430
Why are you sitting here then?

530
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,500
Hey,

531
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,710
shouldn’t parents

532
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:32,520
monitor their kids doing  homework?

533
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,470
Don’t regard yourself as my father.

534
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,230
I’ll have to watch your behaviors

535
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:39,590
to decide if I shall take you as my dad.

536
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:43,190
I can do it.

537
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:44,830
Whatever you want me to do.

538
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,590
In today’s handcraft class,

539
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:54,920
the teacher asked us to make a boat.

540
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,190
Here are the materials.

541
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:57,160
Go make me a boat.

542
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,640
Make… A boat?

543
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,310
No problem.

544
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,680
Don’t disturb me. Go make it over there.

545
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:04,640
OK.

546
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,760
Chen,

547
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,040
you’re so poor at mahjong.

548
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,040
It’s a waste of my beers.

549
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,280
You know what?

550
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:23,160
That Jiang Caiyue

551
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:25,400
is so cunning.

552
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,570
She…

553
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,110
She claimed she played poorly.

554
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:35,110
But she totally dominated the game today.

555
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,400
Slow down. Careful.

556
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,230
Unbelievable!

557
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,220
She’s sly.

558
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:45,180
- The one who wasted the most isn’t me. - Who?

559
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:48,920
It’s Fengqiao.

560
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,130
- OK, it’s Fengqiao. - Not me.

561
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,800
All right. Not you. Not you.

562
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:54,840
Cheers!

563
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:05,760
Dawei.

564
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:08,470
Look at the moon tonight.

565
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:09,430
How beautiful!

566
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,760
Yes.

567
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,430
Aunt Fengqiao.

568
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,040
Qiao.

569
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,560
There’s no moon tonight.

570
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,190
I mean

571
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,430
as long as you’re by my side,

572
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:28,000
I feel like moonlight casts in my heart.

573
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,040
Well…

574
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:33,800
Qiao,

575
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,520
you’re drunk.

576
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:36,680
You really are.

577
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:38,880
I’m never drunk.

578
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,000
Dawei,

579
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:42,310
do you know?

580
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,040
In fact, sometimes,

581
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:46,470
if the girl is slightly older than the boy,

582
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,760
their happiness index

583
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,680
could be higher.

584
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,840
It’s an ancient wisdom…

585
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,000
A wife three years older is a gold brick.

586
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,070
I know the wisdom.

587
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,110
However,

588
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:04,070
you’re a brick too heavy for me to carry.

589
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,590
Dawei,

590
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,160
do you know?

591
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,760
Since the first time I met you…

592
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:16,800
Qiao,

593
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,800
actually,

594
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:23,920
I…

595
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:27,710
I regard you as an aunt.

596
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,200
Aunt?

597
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:30,840
Yes.

598
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,610
You…

599
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:35,820
You take me as an aunt?

600
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:38,190
At the best years

601
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:39,230
of my youth,

602
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:40,830
I give my first love to you

603
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,310
and you take me as an aunt?

604
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,800
Aunt, huh?

605
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,350
You’re a dead man!

606
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,470
I dare you to call that again.

607
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:52,300
All right.

608
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,280
Aunt, aunt, aunt!

609
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,430
I’m going to kill you!

610
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:57,120
- Aunt, aunt! - Stop right there!

611
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,360
Aunt, aunt!

612
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:01,200
- Aunt? I have to kill you! - Aunt!

613
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,400
Aunt, aunt, aunt!

614
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,950
Scumbag!

615
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:05,690
I’m gonna kill you!

616
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:06,250
Aunt!

617
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,110
Stop there!

618
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:07,680
Aunt!

619
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,230
I’m gonna kill you!

620
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:10,240
Easy.

621
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,430
I’m OK. Why are you still up?

622
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,190
Is he playing mobile games?

623
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,400
You drank?

624
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,710
It seems she drank a lot.

625
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,560
Yes, yes.

626
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,350
She drank so much.

627
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,640
I’ll leave Chen to you.

628
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:04,600
OK, OK.

629
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,240
Take care of her.

630
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,070
OK, go to bed.

631
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:09,050
Tang.

632
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:10,570
Why did you drink?

633
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:12,160
And you drank so much.

634
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,000
I’m not drunk.

635
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,040
Of course, you deny it.

636
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,310
No.

637
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,830
Let’s go back to your room.

638
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:37,710
Are you tired?

639
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,470
No.

640
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:43,880
Do you have the feeling

641
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,160
that Aunt Jiang has adapted to the life here?

642
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,920
She had so much fun with Chen last night.

643
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,710
Now that my mom has eased down,

644
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,230
I feel relieved.

645
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:01,310
Have you?

646
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:12,680
Trust me, Qianyu.

647
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:14,680
I won’t go down in the defeat,

648
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:16,310
and I’ll never give up.

649
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:19,680
I believe Aunt Jiang will feel relieved too,

650
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,000
seeing you regain your courage and confidence.

651
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:31,830
Mom.

652
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:33,110
Aunt Jiang.

653
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,160
There you are.

654
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,760
You were awesome last night.

655
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:38,560
Chen took a heavy toll.

656
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:40,590
Of course.

657
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:43,000
They don’t stand a chance against me.

658
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,430
You don’t know

659
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:47,800
my mom is a hidden master of the mahjong world.

660
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:50,280
That’s a little over.

661
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:53,560
I hadn’t played mahjong for years.

662
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:55,110
Well,

663
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:57,520
now they dragged me back in.

664
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:01,070
Qianyu!

665
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,570
Big news!

666
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,480
What’s up?

667
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,000
Big news!

668
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,500
What is it?

669
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,180
We…

670
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:07,070
We have a big order!

671
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,760
We’ve made a deal with GL Tourism.com.

672
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,870
They said a tour group is coming.

673
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:16,870
There are 7 teams coming,

674
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:18,520
12 tourists each.

675
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,230
Plus rooms for the guides.

676
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:21,950
We need 48 rooms.

677
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:23,710
However, some of the rooms

678
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:25,080
have been booked.

679
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,120
So we don’t have enough rooms.

680
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,870
Can we add more beds in the rooms?

681
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:31,630
I’ve proposed to GL Tourism.com.

682
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:33,320
They said it’s a quality-oriented tourist group.

683
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,520
Room share isn’t accepted.

684
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:37,800
OK,

685
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:40,040
call the guests who have made reservations.

686
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,870
Ask them if they’re coming for sure.

687
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:43,230
If they agree to change schedule,

688
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:45,190
we will offer them VIP coupons.

689
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:46,000
OK.

690
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:49,950
But,

691
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:52,280
even if we cancel all the reservations,

692
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,910
we’re still short of two rooms.

693
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:03,230
Why don’t my mom and I move out?

694
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,840
Then you’ll have enough rooms.

695
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,560
How could we do that?

696
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,190
The basic principle of hospitality industry

697
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:14,190
is to always put your guests’ demand first.

698
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,230
Besides,

699
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,560
my mom and I have been freeloaders.

700
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,040
We can’t be a burden forever, right?

701
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,320
OK.

702
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:27,320
Qianyu,

703
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,320
they want to move out.

704
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,390
But where can they go?

705
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,430
Right.

706
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,360
To Money Bag Grocery.

707
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,120
At first, Chen didn’t want you to feel degraded

708
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,230
staying in a house fully packed.

709
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:39,710
So we arranged rooms for you in Guanmei Inn.

710
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:42,280
But lately, she feels remorseful

711
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,800
for keeping distant from you.

712
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:45,430
More importantly,

713
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:47,600
Chen wants to learn mahjong skills from you.

714
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:57,710
OK.

715
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,230
Let’s move to Money Bag Grocery.

716
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:01,840
Mom,

717
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,670
what do you think?

718
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:05,710
If she’s so keen on learning from me,

719
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:07,710
I’d be too petty

720
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,520
to turn her down.

721
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,470
Who is cursing me?

722
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,190
I think you catch a cold.

723
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,280
Last night, you just couldn’t cover yourself up.

724
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:33,800
How do you know it?

725
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:37,840
Last night, you wanted to puke one minute

726
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,000
and to have water the next.

727
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,840
You did that for dozens of times.

728
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,800
Don’t you remember?

729
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,870
Butterball,

730
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:46,390
you didn’t sleep in my room, did you?

731
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:47,670
Honestly,

732
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,950
without me by your side last night,

733
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:52,230
you’d have died of thirst. No kidding.

734
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,950
You didn’t take advantage of me, did you?

735
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,760
I slept on the floor.

736
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:03,080
When you’re asleep,

737
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,360
you sprawl

738
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,280
and occupy the whole bed.

739
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,870
What advantage is there for me to take?

740
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,280
What do you mean?

741
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,320
That you have no desire

742
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,470
to take advantage of me?

743
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,630
We’re an old couple.

744
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:16,670
What desire could I have?

745
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:18,320
Who is in a couple with you?

746
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,670
Don’t flatter yourself.

747
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:28,190
= Ye Qianyu =
Mom, clean up the rooms.

748
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:29,670
I’ve invited Junhao and Aunt Jiang

749
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:30,760
to live with us on your behalf.

750
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:33,840
Remember.

751
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,120
The person they appreciate is you.

752
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,150
Oh, the wicked girl!

753
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,910
She sets me up again!

754
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,300
= Money Bag Grocery =

755
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,040
Plus 360.

756
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,630
How much?

757
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:04,910
You’re back.

758
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:10,040
Come on, aunt.

759
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,520
Welcome.

760
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,150
Your room is cleaned up.

761
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,080
It’ll make you feel at home.

762
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:21,760
It’s convenient to live here.

763
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,470
Hope you’ll like it.

764
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,040
Go up there.

765
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:27,630
Come in.

766
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:29,230
Come in. Come in.

767
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,390
What are you doing?

768
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:31,500
I…

769
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,250
Do the accounting.

770
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,470
Me? Do the accounting?

771
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,040
Aunt.

772
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:44,080
Be careful. Careful.

773
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,630
Aunt,

774
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,470
this used to be my room.

775
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:54,190
It’s yours now.

776
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,630
I’ve changed the sheet and bedcover.

777
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:57,950
They’re all clean.

778
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:01,230
Where will you sleep then?

779
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:03,520
I… I’ll share a room with Chen.

780
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:06,360
Shengzhe, can you share a room with him?

781
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:11,230
Let’s go, Roomie Brother-in-Law.

782
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,190
Let me show you the room.

783
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:14,870
Mom,

784
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:16,600
I’ll go to my room.

785
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:21,420
OK.

786
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,760
Good night.

787
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,760
Good night, aunt.

788
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:28,870
By the way,

789
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:30,670
remember to roll yourself in the quilt.

790
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:31,760
Otherwise, rats

791
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:33,310
will bite your toes.

792
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:35,400
It’s scary.

793
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,800
Aunt, Chen is joking.

794
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,910
There’s no rat in the house.

795
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,630
Sweet dreams.

796
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,190
Does it look familiar?

797
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,560
This is the bed

798
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,080
you used to slept in.

799
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,950
I lived in this room?

800
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:01,320
Not everyone has the honor.

801
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:02,270
Hold on.

802
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,580
Here you go.

803
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:18,500
= Invitation Congratulations on being qualified
to sleep in Ye Shengzhe’s room =

804
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:22,520
Fate is mysterious.

805
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,560
It turns you from the prince
back to the frog again

806
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,910
in Guanmei.

807
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:31,390
I’ll try to accept my fate.

808
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:34,920
Is the number right?

809
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,560
8, 9…

810
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:39,950
Qianyu,

811
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:42,600
all you need to deliver is

812
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,560
Granny Huazi’s goods.

813
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,360
Go to the inn when you come back.

814
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:46,870
Leave the rest to Tang.

815
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:47,880
Hmm.

816
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,430
Don’t mix it up.

817
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,600
Why do you put on Tonghao’s clothes?

818
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,320
How does he look?

819
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,600
The prince has become the frog again.

820
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:06,870
Tonghao looks better to me.

821
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:08,630
Qianyu,

822
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,470
let me go with you.

823
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,180
I’ll drive.

824
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:14,570
Bye.

825
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,190
Be careful. Drive safe.

826
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:22,120
Don’t fall into the heavenly pit.

827
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:22,950
Goodbye, Mama Jinzhi.

828
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:24,150
- Got it. - Take care.

829
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:30,910
That’s great.

830
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:32,280
Are they delivering the goods?

831
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:34,080
- Yes. - Yes.

832
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:50,320
Life isn’t just about playing mahjong.

833
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,600
Let me show you something fun.

834
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:09,520
What are you doing?

835
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,600
Don’t pull me around.

836
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:20,080
Sit.

837
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,560
Trim the vegetables

838
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,910
and peel the potatoes.

839
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:33,040
Me?

840
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:41,910
Have a cup of coffee.

841
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:42,780
Thank you.

842
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:43,710
You’re welcome.

843
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:55,160
What kind of person do you think you are?

844
00:42:58,760 --> 00:42:59,800
I think I’m…

845
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,800
A surplus person.

846
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:08,390
Because I can’t get rid of the fate

847
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:11,040
of being abandoned.

848
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,080
The two most important

849
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,840
people in my life

850
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:19,630
both deserted me.

851
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,520
Granny Huazi!

852
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,670
- Granny Huazi! - Hello, Qianyu.

853
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:27,320
How are you doing?

854
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,360
Tonghao, you’re back.

855
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:35,000
This is Granny Huazi.

856
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,080
We met before.

857
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:37,950
Hi, Granny Huazi.

858
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:40,280
Granny Huazi.

859
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,840
Tonghao is back,

860
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,870
but he doesn’t remember everything

861
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:45,150
about Guanmei.

862
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,120
It doesn’t matter.

863
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:51,040
It’s a whole-new start.

864
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:55,080
Take a seat.

865
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:02,090
Doctor,

866
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,280
how is Yunyi?

867
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,670
Given her status today:

868
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:09,150
low-spirited and distracted.

869
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:10,230
self-negation,

870
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,760
trouble sleeping

871
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,950
and poor appetite as you said,

872
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:18,470
basically, I can confirm that
she’s mildly depressed.

873
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,080
Qianyu,

874
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,670
is Devil Forest truly so dangerous?

875
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:27,430
Yes.

876
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,000
Last time, it was in here

877
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,840
we fell into a heavenly pit

878
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,600
on a delivery errand to Granny Huazi.

879
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,360
I limped for quite a few days.

880
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,520
Were it not for you,

881
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,190
I would still be in the pit.

882
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:40,910
You told me about it once,

883
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,280
but I didn’t believe you.

884
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:47,280
Since when

885
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,630
do you begin to believe me?

886
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:50,630
Maybe

887
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:52,600
when you let me stay in Guanmei Inn.

888
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,280
Or maybe

889
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,630
when you looked at me as you do now,

890
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:58,760
trying to find Tonghao in me.

891
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
I’m not sure.

892
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,390
After I turned back to Shan Junhao,

893
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:09,040
you often distracted me.

894
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,320
I couldn’t help paying attention to you.

895
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:18,430
That’s because of my overwhelming charm.

896
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,910
I can feel Tonghao was happy here.

897
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:28,710
But,

898
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,600
I find

899
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,150
I can’t turn back to him.

900
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:39,760
I know

901
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,520
the gap between you and him troubles you.

902
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:44,040
However,

903
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:45,470
trust me.

904
00:45:45,950 --> 00:45:47,560
Everything will be fine.

905
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:55,120
You don’t need to pretend to be Tonghao.

906
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:58,150
Because Shan Junhao is you, too.

907
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:02,430
Thank you, Qianyu.

908
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:04,320
I promise.

909
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,950
I’ll get used to everything in here gradually.

910
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:08,840
Let’s go.

911
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:10,520
