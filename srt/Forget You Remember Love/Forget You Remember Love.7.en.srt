Pretty!

13
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,240
I will charge you if you keep looking.

14
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,630
I agree.

15
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:10,060
Just keep it on credit

16
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,040
and I will make money and pay you gradually.

17
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,590
Mama Jinzhi.

18

Cabriolet guy.

19
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:31,730
I am coming to visit Qianyu.

20
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,170
OK.

21
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,700
What a beautiful bundle of flowers!

22
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,390
I don’t think there’s any flower shop at Guanmei.

23
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,440
Did you buy it in the downtown?

24
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,020
Yes.

25
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,700
Great!

26
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,360
Qianyu is in her room.

27
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,310
Go up and she is there.

28
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:48,760
OK, thanks.

29
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,250
OK.

30
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,940
What a good son-in-law!

31
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,230
Taichu, it is a surprise to see you here.

32
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,960
I think you may feel bored alone at home

33
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:07,920
so I hope to keep you company.

34
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,020
The flowers are for you.

35
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,080
Thanks.

36
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,250
Tonghao,

37
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:17,770
haven’t you gone to Indonesia?

38
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,010
Qianyu didn’t allow me to go

39
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,050
and asked me to come back.

40
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,470
It is an illegal agency

41
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,870
and Tonghao will just become
illegal laborers there.

42
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,040
Luckily I found it just in time.

43
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,130
Luckily that you returned safe and sound.

44
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,520
Were you playing the piano just now?

45
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,260
Go on!

46
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:35,850
Taichu, thank you!

47
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:38,480
For what?

48
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,870
I know you have kept it a secret intentionally.

49
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,650
But I will repay you

50
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:44,730
the money for the piano gradually.

51
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,570
What are you talking about, Qianyu?

52
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:48,890
I don’t understand.

53
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,090
Anyway,

54
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,080
thank you for the piano as a gift for me.

55
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,870
I didn’t give you a piano as a gift.

56
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,060
Yes, you have given me this piano as a gift.

57
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,710
It is really not a gift from me.

58
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,670
Isn’t this piano a gift from you?

59
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,000
No.

60
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,090
Who did this then?

61
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,800
Maybe somebody

62
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,700
wants to give you a pleasant surprise.

63
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,100
Continue to play the piano.

64
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:17,900
I can’t play the piano.

65
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,070
Taichu, will you play it?

66
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:21,770
OK.

67
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:28,250
I will play the favorite music of your mother.

68
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:28,940
OK.

69
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,800
Are you playing Canon in D Major?

70
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,290
Exactly!

71
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,160
How about this?

72
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,990
Chopin’s Fantasy-Impromptu in C-Sharp Minor

73
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,090
How do you know that, Tonghao?

74
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,310
You seem to be an expert in music.

75
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,260
Tonghao, go and deliver the goods.

76
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,650
Qianyu, let’s go together.

77
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,600
I don’t know the way.

78
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,600
Why are you so silly?

79
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,930
You just sit in front and be my guide

80
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:51,460
and go for a ride too.

81
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:52,840
I can carry you downstairs.

82
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,950
No. I can go downstairs by myself

83
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,200
with my one and a half legs.

84
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,640
Taichu, I am sorry.

85
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:01,320
I will practice the piano with you next time.

86
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:02,930
I will deliver goods with him today.

87
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:04,950
OK.

88
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:07,410
- Wait. - What’s up?

89
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,060
Don’t move.

90
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,400
What are you doing, Tonghao? Put me down.

91
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:16,780
Put me down.

92
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,570
Your leg is hurt and you can’t walk by yourself.

93
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,100
Slow down.

94
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,220
Tonghao!

95
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,720
Where are you taking Qianyu to?

96
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,260
I am going to deliver goods

97
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,990
and take Qianyu outside for a ride.

98
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,510
Mama Jinzhi, bye!

99
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,450
Tonghao!

100
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:27,990
Why are you grinning so silly?
Have you got a windfall?

101
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,410
I don’t know.

102
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,540
I just feel so happy,

103
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,170
even happier than getting a windfall.

104
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,070
Tonghao,

105
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:38,450
I didn’t expect you are an expert in music.

106
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:42,090
Maybe I usually attended a concert before.

107
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,100
I don’t think so.

108
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:47,580
You might be a waiter at a concert hall before.

109
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,130
A waiter?

110
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,890
But you can always bring me
many pleasant surprises.

111
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,650
I have lived in Guanmei Fishing Village
for a while.

112
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,570
In the beginning,

113
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:17,400
I thought it needed improvements
at this place indeed.

114
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,300
But later I found

115
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,280
many cultural elements

116
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,070
deserved preservation.

117
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:23,830
I will illustrate it in details

118
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:24,980
in my report.

119
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:28,280
Moreover, the story of white dolphins

120
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,080
is possibly true.

121
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,050
But I haven’t found the evidences.

122
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,990
If the story is true,

123
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:35,420
our plan will be

124
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,560
greatly affected.

125
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,840
I will try to prove it as soon as possible.

126
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:40,570
OK.

127
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,240
My foot has recovered.

128
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,360
Qianyu,

129
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,440
Tonghao, look!

130
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,540
My foot has recovered.

131
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,220
So we can deliver goods together, right?

132
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:06,970
Yes.

133
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:17,710
Mr. Tang,

134
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,370
you haven’t signed this agreement.

135
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,260
I won’t sign it.

136
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:23,600
I enjoy priority to buy back

137
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,500
Guanmei Hotel.

138
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,170
As I said before,

139
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,540
you might preferentially buy back

140
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,860
the shares mortgaged with Senwell.

141
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:32,980
But it has expired.

142
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:35,680
I very much understand that
Guanmei Hotel is your ancestral property

143
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,670
and you feel reluctant to sell it.

144
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,920
But you must

145
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,170
recognize the facts now.

146
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:41,300
Signing this contract

147
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,620
and all your arrears for Senwell

148
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,900
will be cancelled once and for all

149
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,870
and you will also get

150
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:47,150
an additional compensation of 2 million yuan.

151
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:47,820
Mr. Tang,

152
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,460
Although it is no big money,

153
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,600
it is enough for you.

154
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,660
According to the previous mortgage contract,

155
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:56,120
we can take over Guanmei unconditionally.

156
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,680
This is our second visit here.

157
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,350
Mr. Tang,

158
00:09:58,370 --> 00:09:59,860
If you insist,

159
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,350
Senwell has to launch enforcement.

160
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,890
You shouldn’t do that.

161
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:11,960
Sales revenue 1,800 yuan.

162
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,400
Cost 1,400 yuan.

163
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:15,930
Profit 400 yuan.

164
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,660
Chen,

165
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,760
can I get some pocket money?

166
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:23,660
No.

167
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,380
You have too many pocket moneys.

168
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,300
How about me?

169
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:29,880
Not, either.

170
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,850
Mama Jinzhi,

171
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,270
can I check your account book?

172
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:41,120
Do you understand it?

173
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,580
Tonghao,

174
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:53,820
I have found a job for you through an agent.

175
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:56,760
A construction worker in Saudi Arabia.

176
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,380
They say you can make several
hundreds of thousands of yuan a year.

177
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,500
The salary and working environment
are both very good.

178
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,290
It is not illegal laborer this time.

179
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:06,180
My nephew confirmed it with me personally

180
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,030
because he is also working there.

181
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,500
Mama Jinzhi,

182
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,990
why do you feel so obliged to drive me away?

183
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,500
To Indonesia

184
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,890
and then Saudi Arabia.

185
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,640
Do you think I am a big trouble here?

186
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,950
I am not a liar at all,

187
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:22,930
right?

188
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,760
You are a liar of course.

189
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,190
You cheat our money

190
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:28,760
and also want to deceive Qianyu.

191
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:29,690
Mom.

192
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,440
Mama Jinzhi,

193
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,290
I think

194
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:37,000
you are wrong in the profit calculation
in your account book.

195
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,130
What?

196
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,620
I have always calculated it in this way
in the last couple of years.

197
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,420
The cost you mentioned just now

198
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,910
is only the purchase cost

199
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:47,700
but doesn’t include the labor,
water and electricity costs

200
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:48,770
and also house rental.

201
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,800
This house is our own house

202
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,680
and we run the grocery ourselves.

203
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:56,150
So there is no rental and labor cost.

204
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,260
Strictly speaking,

205
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,370
this house is valuable.

206
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:03,720
Although it doesn’t bring rentals,

207
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,520
it has depreciation.

208
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,670
You work for yourselves every day

209
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:08,700
and you deserve salaries

210
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,610
because you need to make a living.

211
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,730
The cost shall not be taken as profit.

212
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,860
Can you be more reasonable?

213
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,110
I can make a detailed adjustment plan

214
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:20,100
for Money Bag Grocery.

215
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,910
Tonghao is very talented.

216
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,560
Useful.

217
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,860
Can I stay here then?

218
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:36,640
It depends on your performances.

219
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,650
Qianyu! Qianyu!

220
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:40,830
Sheng.

221
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:41,490
Big trouble!

222
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,060
What’s up?

223
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:43,470
Senwell dispatched a group of people here.

224
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:44,700
They are forcing

225
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,290
Tang to sign a contract.

226
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,500
Just go and take a look.

227
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,290
What?

228
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:51,960
Let’s go.

229
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:53,100
Go.

230
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,210
Take care.

231
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,800
Mama Jinzhi’.

232
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,200
What happened to them?

233
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,530
Where?

234
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,540
Upstairs!

235
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,110
What have they done to Tang?

236
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:24,250
I don’t know. They are still discussing.

237
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,680
They said they would force Tang
to sign the contract at all costs.

238
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:27,980
I will go and see.

239
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:28,910
OK.

240
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,090
Take care.

241
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:40,550
Qianyu.

242
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,310
I didn’t expect to see you here.

243
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,740
I am your strong backup. Don’t worry.

244
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,890
Tang, whoever dares to force you

245
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:51,320
will have to face severe consequences.

246
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:53,860
Who are you?

247
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,830
I am Ye Qianyu,

248
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:56,170
guardian of Guanmei Hotel.

249
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:02,570
I see.

250
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,890
Let me go to Guanmei Hotel and see what I can do.

251
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:10,550
What is the use of your going there?

252
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,140
I just go and have a look.

253
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,460
As you like.

254
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:25,430
You are pushing Tang to the corner.

255
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:26,890
Don’t go ahead any further.

256
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:28,950
I think it is a misunderstanding, miss.

257
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:29,720
Misunderstanding?

258
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,920
Obviously, you are trying to
take away Tang’s hotel.

259
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,660
Qianyu, stop talking.

260
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,600
We didn’t force Mr. Tang.

261
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,770
Mr. Tang mortgaged his shares

262
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:40,770
with the financial company

263
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,430
under Senwell.

264
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,070
We are just performing the contract.

265
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,070
Don’t look for an excuse to justify yourself.

266
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,850
Guanmei Hotel is Tang’s home

267
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:50,980
and his life.

268
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,290
How can you be so ruthless
to dismantle it at your will?

269
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,290
Please be empathetic.

270
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,770
If we want to dismantle your home,

271
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,900
will you agree peacefully?

272
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,840
I am sorry, Mr. Tang,

273
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,050
can you explain to this lady first?

274
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:06,840
Forget it.

275
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,590
Don’t talk about it anymore.

276
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,100
Sorry.

277
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:12,830
Miss Fan.

278
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:18,380
Director Xu,

279
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,380
can I talk to you separately for a while?

280
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,560
You can talk about anything in public.

281
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,620
All the people here

282
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:31,720
are trustworthy representatives of Senwell.

283
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:36,340
I just want to talk to you separately.

284
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:42,660
OK.

285
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,700
Qianyu, just stay here.

286
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,750
No, I must protect you, Tang.

287
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,080
Take it easy, I will find a good solution.

288
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,310
What’s going on now?

289
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,210
Tang said he hoped to talk
to Director Xu separately.

290
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:40,810
Washroom?

291
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:41,520
What?

292
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,940
Director Xu!

293
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:45,080
What are they going to talk about?

294
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,110
Look!

295
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,450
Mr. Tang, what do you want to talk to me?

296
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,800
If you can help me to protect Guanmei Hotel,

297
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,020
I will do you a favor.

298
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:11,940
What favor?

299
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,210
As you know,

300
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,740
the news is fake.

301
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,090
Your general manager Shan Junhao

302
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:18,040
has never gone abroad at all.

303
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:20,570
Mr. Tang,

304
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:22,360
I wonder

305
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:24,430
what is the relation between

306
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:26,220
Mr. Shan’s going abroad and your hotel.

307
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:28,220
You don’t have to cover it up.

308
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,800
Frankly,

309
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,390
you know it better than me

310
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:32,780
what consequences there may be

311
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:35,020
if the media knows about
Mr. Shan’s traffic accident.

312
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,200
What?

313
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,440
If you return Guanmei Hotel to me,

314
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,050
we can make a deal

315
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,710
and I will continue to keep it a secret for you.

316
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,280
As you know,

317
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,240
the news about the traffic accident

318
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,120
and disappearance of Mr. Shan,

319
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,130
the general manager of Senwell Group,

320
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:57,320
will have great impacts

321
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,320
on your share price.

322
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:02,170
I guess you have many concerns

323
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,290
so you had to cover it up from the public

324
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,970
by claiming he has gone abroad.

325
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:10,970
Mr. Tang,

326
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,420
you can’t make up a story

327
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,710
just to protect your hotel.

328
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,390
It is not empty talk.

329
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,730
I know you need evidences

330
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:25,250
and I have such evidences.

331
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,420
Yunyi,

332
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:37,710
let’s go.

333
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,180
They are coming!

334
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:01,850
Go, go, go!

335
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,340
- Boss. - Boss.

336
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,510
What did you say to him?

337
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:08,730
What did you say?

338
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:16,010
Go.

339
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:25,340
= Guanmei Hotel =

340
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,410
Ziqian.

341
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,480
What’s up?

342
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,210
Director Xu, we will go to pick up the car.

343
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,250
What’s up, Yunyi?

344
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,920
Your expressions were different
when you came out just now.

345
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:00,800
What did Tang Shunming say to you?

346
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,170
Tang, what did you say to them?

347
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,800
What did you say, boss?

348
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:12,430
I got a grace period of one month.

349
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:15,540
Good news.

350
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:26,540
Qianyu!

351
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,860
Why are you here?

352
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,440
Shan Junhao!

353
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,480
It is me.

354
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,720
I am coming here for you.

355
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,220
Qianyu.

356
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,130
Hello, everybody.

357
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:50,350
Who is that?

358
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:52,100
He…

359
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:54,930
He is my cousin.

360
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,600
I don’t know

361
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:59,550
you have a cousin.

362
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,530
Yes, Qianyu.

363
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:04,520
I have seen all your relatives.

364
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:05,810
Ziqian,

365
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:07,500
do you know how important

366
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,380
the Guanmei Project is to us?

367
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,980
If we can’t get it,

368
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,820
we will be at a disadvantage in the future.

369
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:14,510
I know.

370
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:17,360
We have to get more time for Junhao.

371
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:19,790
Get in the car first.

372
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:25,340
Handsome guy, what’s your name?

373
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:26,490
My name is Tonghao.

374
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,890
Tonghao?

375
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:30,170
What a strange name.

376
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,700
Master, listen,

377
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:34,540
a handsome guy always has a good name

378
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:37,360
whatever it may be.

379
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,470
Keep yourself under control.

380
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,470
How are things getting along?

381
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:41,270
They agreed

382
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:42,490
to give Tang a grace period of one month.

383
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,290
Great!

384
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:53,580
= Guanmei Hotel =

385
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,820
What are you looking at?

386
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,060
Whose car is it?

387
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:24,810
Qianyu,

388
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,950
is he really your cousin?

389
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:28,990
Yes.

390
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:37,600
Come on,

391
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:39,460
come with me.

392
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,200
Handsome guy.

393
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,080
What?

394
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:54,380
This is what has happened.

395
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,800
So never tell others.

396
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,150
Listen, take Tonghao here.

397
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:12,820
OK.

398
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,170
Don’t tell others.

399
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,580
Now you can tell me

400
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:30,550
what Tang Shunming told you.

401
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:42,280
He knows about Junhao’s car accident.

402
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,320
How did he know that?

403
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:50,320
I know you need evidences

404
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:54,030
and I have such evidences.

405
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:54,920
What evidences?

406
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:55,850
I saw it.

407
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,920
You were there when the accident happened?

408
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:58,810
Yes.

409
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,460
Did you do it?

410
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:02,400
Do you think you can protect your hotel

411
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,520
in this way?

412
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,700
I didn’t do it.

413
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:06,510
I used to have such an idea

414
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:08,570
but I dismissed it at the last moment.

415
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:10,040
It is just an accident.

416
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:10,740
Why didn’t you

417
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,430
tell me right away?

418
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:13,840
I called the police immediately.

419
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,640
If I had told you then,

420
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,260
you would have suspected me like today.

421
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,140
But I remember the car.

422
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,370
Tang Shunming,

423
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,860
I thought you were an honest person.

424
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:42,340
I didn’t expect you would

425
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,330
threaten me with Junhao’s accident.

426
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,970
I didn’t wish to, Director Xu.

427
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,650
If you were

428
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:53,440
in the same situation as me,

429
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,400
you would understand my feelings.

430
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,120
OK.

431
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,990
I will give you a grace period of one month.

432
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,290
Tang Shunming shouldn’t have done that.

433
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:13,260
I didn’t expect that, either.

434
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,940
But he still has some conscience.

435
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,580
But he had the desire to hurt Junhao.

436
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,190
Why did you agree?

437
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:21,970
Because I believe Junhao is still alive.

438
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:25,680
Before he comes back,

439
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,780
we must protect Senwell.

440
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,110
But,

441
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,650
if he had told us earlier,

442
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:35,540
we may have found

443
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,950
Junhao now.

444
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,120
Yunyi,

445
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,330
don’t tell Aunt Jiang

446
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:58,400
and Uncle Shan about it.

447
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,770
Mr. Tang, are you looking for me?

448
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,030
Mr. Tang,

449
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,180
do you know me?

450
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,240
No.

451
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,240
I don’t know you.

452
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,870
Qianyu told me

453
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,680
that you had lost your memory.

454
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,660
I don’t remember my past.

455
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:54,290
But I think it is good now.

456
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:56,380
Qianyu and Mama Jinzhi

457
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,040
are very good to me.

458
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,050
If that is the case,

459
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:06,370
you just stay here.

460
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,000
If you are in trouble,

461
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,520
come to me for help at any time.

462
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,500
OK.

463
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:11,890
Thanks, Mr. Tang.

464
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:15,280
I have to go now.

465
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,810
Hey, wait a minute.

466
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,150
Anything I can help you?

467
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:24,730
Well…

468
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,280
Don’t you feel a little curious

469
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,730
about your past?

470
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,570
About this,

471
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:41,080
actually, I felt curious

472
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,670
and even at a loss in the beginning.

473
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:46,370
But then

474
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:48,110
I realized

475
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:50,580
it wasn’t important at all.

476
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,460
What is most important now

477
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:55,340
is that Guanmei Fishing Village is my home.

478
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:58,230
Qianyu, Mama Jinzhi

479
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,370
and Shengzhe

480
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,140
are all my family.

481
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:07,680
It is not easy for you

482
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:09,410
to be so open-minded at such a young age.

483
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:12,160
I learned it all from Guanmei Fishing Village.

484
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:17,990
Unfortunately,

485
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:19,180
Senwell

486
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,910
is determined to dismantle
our Guanmei Fishing Village.

487
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:22,410
I…

488
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:26,880
Well…

489
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:29,420
Just do your job if you are busy.

490
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,240
OK, I am leaving now.

491
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:09,890
What are you thinking about?

492
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:13,360
I am thinking how

493
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,720
I can make 8 million yuan a month.

494
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:17,780
So much money!

495
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:24,040
There is only one way out.

496
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,500
Just hand over the hotel

497
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,470
to such a management group as Senwell.

498
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:32,450
I have checked the data.

499
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,620
The hotels under its flagship

500
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,860
are top ones in the Asia-Pacific region.

501
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:38,390
So Senwell is absolutely a professional

502
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:39,980
hotel operator.

503
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:43,310
What are you talking about?

504
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:45,400
Tang’s hotel is going to be dismantled.

505
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,150
How can you speak for Senwell?

506
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:48,520
I am not speaking for Senwell.

507
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:51,940
I am just telling the truth.

508
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:54,800
Don’t you remember that

509
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:57,240
I checked the hotel all around
when I was looking for you then?

510
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:00,140
The equipment is too old and the service is poor.

511
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,260
Such a hotel won’t work well.

512
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,460
Refitting is necessary
if operation has to continue

513
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,480
and it will take a long time for such refitting.

514
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:08,410
Tang has a big debt to repay

515
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:10,110
and he can’t change the status quo

516
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:11,130
in just a month.

517
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,050
You don’t know it at all.

518
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:15,980
Guanmei Hotel is even more precious than his life.

519
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:17,820
It is the memory of

520
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,220
every one at Guanmei Fishing Village.

521
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,740
But it is the reality.

522
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:22,670
Without any better choice,

523
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:24,670
Tang has to give up.

524
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:28,230
Such a person who has lost his memory as you

525
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:28,980
will never understand

526
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,730
why we have to insist here.

527
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,150
Yes.

528
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:38,920
I have lost my memory.

529
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:41,670
But I can see the reality

530
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,680
and the increasing decline of the hotel.

531
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,300
The hotel has no time,

532
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:50,060
capital and talent

533
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,870
and it can’t continue operation in this condition.

534
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,950
Tang accumulated such a big debt payable
to Senwell in 5 years

535
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,850
and that is the proof.

536
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,290
It is none of your business.

537
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:03,000
You are not qualified to be our mentor.

538
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:08,980
Qianyu!

539
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,920
= Guanmei Hotel =

540
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:11,610
Qianyu!

541
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,620
Mind your step!

542
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,980
Or you will damage the stairway
and pay for the repair.

543
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,520
Why is she so furious?

544
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,640
Tonghao, did you quarrel?

545
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:48,620
You must have found

546
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,390
who Ye Qianyu is like just in time.

547
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,840
Who offended Ye Qianyu on earth?

548
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,570
Me.

549
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,060
Man!

550
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,940
Shengzhe, are you still awake?

551
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:28,010
How can I fall asleep

552
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:29,330
when you keep rolling over on bed?

553
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,680
Sorry.

554
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:38,320
Do you know

555
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:40,350
what’s the most mysterious thing in the universe?

556
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:41,520
What is that?

557
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:43,370
The mind of a girl.

558
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:48,330
Shengzhe,

559
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,840
can you tell me

560
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:54,660
why Qianyu cares about Guanmei Hotel so much.

561
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:58,110
Since her mother died

562
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,870
and she came to this island with her father,

563
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,670
Guanmei Hotel has become her home

564
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,510
and where she has grown up.

565
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:15,920
Maybe people who have lost memories like me

566
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,840
can hardly know her feelings.

567
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:20,200
How about now?

568
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:21,820
What is most valuable

569
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,450
to you?

570
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:28,190
Most valuable?

571
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:30,410
Just imagine.

572
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:34,110
Will you agree if Taichu takes Ye Qianyu away

573
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:35,230
from you?

574
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:38,440
If you are reluctant to give up Ye Qianyu,

575
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:41,370
Ye Qianyu is also reluctant
to give up Guanmei Hotel.

576
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:49,460
I see.

577
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:53,060
A man’s intelligence will decline sharply
when he is in love.

578
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:54,670
I am really upset to see that.

579
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,240
Ye Qianyu, Ye Shengzhe,

580
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,680
come down for breakfast.

581
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,220
Hurry up!

582
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:21,180
Emergency!

583
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,290
Tonghao is gone!

584
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:24,700
He is gone？

585
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:25,360
Tonghao got up

586
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,290
one hour earlier than usual today.

587
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:29,430
I haven’t seen him since he got up.

588
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:34,050
He promised me he would stay here.

589
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,020
Breakfast time!

590
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,780
= Guanmei Hotel =

591
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:48,100
There must be good services and good environments

592
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,670
if you want to run a hotel well.

593
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,630
Do you have them?

594
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,960
Yes?

595
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:56,990
- Yes. - No. -

596
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,580
Yes or no?

597
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,780
No.

598
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,190
Service may be the most

599
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:05,350
or the least costly

600
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:07,070
in the world.

601
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:10,410
First of all,

602
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:12,330
appearance

603
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:15,820
is the most fundamental respect to customers.

604
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,010
Moreover,

605
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,010
a clean, neat and tidy environment

606
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,370
is also the most fundamental.

607
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,760
Do you want to save Guanmei Hotel?

608
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:31,380
Come on.

609
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:34,630
Get started.

610
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:01,550
What are you doing?

611
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:07,370
Qianyu, you are finally here!

612
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:09,640
Your cousin woke us up early in the morning

613
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:10,620
and requested us

614
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,960
to do one job after another.

615
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,210
Is he here to help us

616
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:15,630
or punish us?

617
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,330
Qianyu,

618
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:19,760
I am still dozing now.

619
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:21,350
Is it useful for us

620
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:22,700
to do so much?

621
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:57,880
It seems to be really different

622
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,690
and much brighter now!

623
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:02,370
It is marvelous

624
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,060
to have such great changes

625
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,010
after slight adjustments by Tonghao.

626
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:07,240
OK.

627
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,360
You can take a rest now.

628
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:11,910
We will continue ten minutes later.

629
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:21,330
What are you doing?

630
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:25,360
I am trying to rescue Guanmei Hotel.

631
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,250
Didn’t you recommend having

632
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:29,420
Senwell as operator of Guanmei Hotel?

633
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,460
It is the place where you have grown up.

634
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:41,960
It’s laden with many of your beautiful memories.

635
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:45,310
So

636
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:50,920
I hope to guard it with you.

637
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,180
Welcome.

638
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:10,180
What’s up?

639
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,060
Come in, please.

640
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:15,450
What are you doing?

641
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:28,090
Will people of the Ministry of Health
come for a check today?

642
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:30,280
I didn’t receive any notice.

643
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:31,580
Boss.

644
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,620
Tonghao asked us to do it.

645
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,620
Do you think our hotel is revitalized again?

646
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,260
Boss, I haven’t seen

647
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,490
such bright sunshine through the window for long.

648
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:43,470
Tonghao,

649
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:47,530
was it all done at your request?

650
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:50,540
Tonghao has done it for our good.

651
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,090
He said

652
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:52,900
he would guard Guanmei Hotel with us.

653
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,170
Mr. Tang,

654
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,600
I have checked the financial statements

655
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:00,520
of Guanmei Hotel for the past 3 years.

656
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,460
OK.

657
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,480
What?

658
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:05,470
Who gave you the financial statements?

659
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:10,160
Fengqiao,

660
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:13,710
you always lose your stance

661
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:15,280
whenever you see a handsome guy.

662
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:16,730
How dare you disclose

663
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,400
such trade secrets to others?

664
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:21,980
Everybody knows that

665
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,350
Guanmei Hotel loses more than

666
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:24,760
one hundred thousand yuan every month.

667
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:26,150
There hasn’t been any single customer

668
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:27,020
other than flies in the last few months.

669
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,230
Me.

670
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,610
But I am not a fly.

671
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:37,240
Mr. Tang,

672
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:39,670
if you want to refit Guanmei Hotel,

673
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,070
I think you should change
your management philosophy.

674
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:45,570
Guanmei Hotel’s loss keeps increasing now.

675
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:46,710
The fundamental reason

676
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:47,160
actually lies in

677
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:49,450
your failure to improve total quality management.

678
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:50,870
What?

679
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:52,320
Total what?

680
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:54,810
TQM. Total quality management.

681
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,840
Without total quality management,

682
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:03,170
guest satisfaction tracking system and

683
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:05,390
integrated business plan,

684
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:06,590
you will know nothing about

685
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:10,250
Guanmei Hotel’s market penetration index.

686
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,730
Guanmei Hotel

687
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:13,970
needs comprehensive and systematized management.

688
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:15,720
Mr. Tang, you can just check

689
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:18,070
the negative comment ratio
of Guanmei Hotel on MT website.

690
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,740
Customer experience is fundamental

691
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,860
of a hotel’s survival.

692
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,430
A hotel without good customer experiences

693
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:25,320
will only have poor customer comments.

694
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:27,120
If you want to change the hotel,

695
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:29,240
you need to firstly

696
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,840
change your philosophies.

697
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,930
Operated in the name of a hotel,

698
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:33,760
Guanmei Hotel actually doesn’t

699
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,390
have the base and capability to run a hotel.

700
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:36,350
I recommend

701
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:38,880
renaming Guanmei Hotel as Guanmei Inn

702
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,600
and turning it into a homestay facility.

703
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:42,660
I agree.

704
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:43,800
You may refer to the examples of

705
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:45,670
Antalya’s Citrus Garden Hotel

706
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:47,520
and Jakarta’s Sunshine Seaviews.

707
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:48,010
No.

708
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,860
I don’t think so.

709
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:53,740
Guests stay at Citrus Garden Hotel

710
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,400
simply to see the Kaleci City

711
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:57,530
and enjoy the feeling of roaming
in a seaside city.

712
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:59,140
And Sunshine Seaviews

713
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:01,340
is more like a five-star hotel.

714
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:04,750
But Citrus Garden Hotel

715
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:05,780
also advocates the scenes of sand ocean,

716
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,870
and the service concept of Sunshine Seaviews

717
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:09,540
is the most human-oriented one I’ve ever seen.

718
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:12,200
I believe the most valuable reference for us

719
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:14,200
is West Meadow.

720
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,890
Can you talk about something we know?

721
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:22,910
Yes.

722
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:24,440
Qianyu,

723
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:25,520
I didn’t expect

724
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:27,100
you had such a handsome and cool cousin.

725
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:30,870
Of course.

726
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:33,230
Tonghao, come with me.

727
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,320
Tonghao,

728
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:41,300
what did you do on earth before?

729
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:42,910
I don’t know.

730
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:45,040
I don’t know why.

731
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:45,820
I had many ideas just now

732
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,640
and I couldn’t help saying them.

733
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:53,130
You are so

734
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:55,090
well-educated!

735
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:56,260
It is just a hobby.

736
00:42:57,810 --> 00:42:58,940
I think our hotel…

737
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,290
You are not a simple person

738
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:05,190
although I didn’t understand
what you were talking about.

739
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:09,600
Maybe my job

740
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,210
had something to do with hotel management.

741
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:16,560
Sorry.

742
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:19,580
I shouldn’t have been so angry
with you last night.

743
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:21,190
It doesn’t matter.

744
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,900
Because you make me understand

745
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,850
we should work hard

746
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:27,790
for the people and things we care about.

747
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:31,850
Taichu,

748
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:34,230
you have been to so many countries.

749
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,630
Why have you stayed at this small Guanmei Hotel

750
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,820
for so long

751
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:40,860
and helped us refit the hotel?

752
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,320
Because

753
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:44,250
it’s a place that deserves to be better.

754
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:14,660
♪ Distance between us ♪

755
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:23,020
