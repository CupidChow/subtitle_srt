Don’t you ever

be so silly again

14
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,340
to hide your private money in the fortune frog?

15
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:01,180
Of course not.

Get to the point!

17
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,220
Is there anything special you did

18
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,450
with Tonghao together

19
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,750
in the wild

20
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:14,500
last night?

21
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,120
Mom.

22
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,150
That is pure imagination.

23
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,660
We certainly did nothing special together.

24
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:21,690
I warn you.

25
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,960
Keep a distance away from Tonghao.

26
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:24,750
Come on!

27
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,270
Just mind your own business!

28
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,490
It is a rare chance to have a rich guy
at Guanmei Fishing Village.

29
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,250
You can’t afford to miss

30
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:33,660
the cabriolet guy.

31
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,480
You...

32
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,530
You must remember what I said.

33
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,520
Mom.

34
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,800
Hello.

35
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,020
How does Dad feel today?

36
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,420
A little better.

37
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,650
How about the company?

38
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:19,280
Zhang Minghan plans to hold a board meeting

39
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:21,750
and re-elect the general manager.

40
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:27,540
What shall we do then?

41
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,420
Your father can’t attend the board meeting

42
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,080
considering his conditions.

43
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,100
Aunt Jiang,

44
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,440
take it easy.

45
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,860
We will find a way out.

46
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,280
Ziqian.

47
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,650
Shan Junhao disappeared for no reason at all.

48
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,270
He said it was a secret research abroad

49
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,500
but didn’t provide any detail on it.

50
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,170
It isn’t a good practice

51
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,760
on his part.

52
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,590
As general manager of Senwell,

53
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:04,110
he is very irresponsible.

54
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,890
What shall we do here in the company then?

55
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,190
Just sit here and do nothing?

56
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,790
How about the development plan
of Guanmei Fishing Village?

57
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,170
How to explain to the shareholders?

58
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,740
As I told Mrs. Shan,

59
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,760
if Shan Junhao

60
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,820
can’t attend the board meeting personally today,

61
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,880
he must host it via a videoconference.

62
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,500
It is already half past ten now,

63
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,600
but Shan Junhao hasn’t shown up.

64
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:27,630
How can we

65
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,170
trust him in the future?

66
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,340
Listen, everybody,

67
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,580
the share price of Senwell
has been dropping continuously.

68
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,440
If it continues,

69
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,020
we will suffer enormous losses.

70
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,840
Exactly!

71
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,820
Senwell must have a leader.

72
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,790
Do you agree with me?

73
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:48,650
Yes.

74
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,000
I have an idea.

75
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,080
Our vice president Zhang Minghan

76
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,450
is the second largest shareholder of Senwell.

77
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,400
He has always been

78
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,010
a diligent person at work

79
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:02,050
and he isn’t inferior to Shan Junhao

80
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,210
either in professionalism or work attitude.

81
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,760
If Shan Junhao is so irresponsible

82
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,040
to the group,

83
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,210
we are fully justified to replace him,

84
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,060
right?

85
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:13,520
I recommend

86
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,150
electing vice president Zhang Minghan

87
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,690
as the interim general manager

88
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,230
and he will lead Senwell through the difficulties.

89
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,070
Good idea. I agree.

90
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:24,440
I agree too.

91
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:25,820
I agree.

92
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,060
I don’t agree.

93
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,010
What is he doing?

94
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:44,960
Director Xu,

95
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:45,830
Miss Fan,

96
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,170
it is a board meeting.

97
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,030
You are not qualified for it.

98
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:51,390
Yes.

99
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,770
Chairman Shan is sick
and can’t attend it personally.

100
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,000
= Power of Attorney for Interim Chairman =
He has designated me as his agent

101
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,560
to attend this meeting.

102
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,180
I am authorized to

103
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,900
speak out on behalf of the chairman

104
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,240
on any decision to be passed at this meeting.

105
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,980
= Power of Attorney for Interim Chairman =

106
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,690
Director Xu,

107
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:32,890
although you can represent the chairman,

108
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,480
you can’t represent the general manager.

109
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,310
Mr. Shan is having a secret research abroad

110
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,600
and he will be back soon.

111
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,620
I can’t publicize

112
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:42,860
details of the research for now

113
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,000
because it is a major business.

114
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,560
Please don’t worry about it.

115
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,120
As we all know,

116
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,460
Mr. Shan isn’t an irresponsible person.

117
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,870
During his tenure as the general manager,

118
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,190
he has developed so many big projects for Senwell

119
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,800
so that our share price

120
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:58,900
has been rising continuously.

121
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,400
We should have confidence in him.

122
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,700
But he is absent

123
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,440
and Senwell needs a leader.

124
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,480
During this period,

125
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,760
Chairman Shan personally
will perform the duties on his behalf.

126
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,910
What suggestions do you have?

127
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,110
Can our chairman stand

128
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,210
such heavy workloads

129
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,000
when he is so seriously ill?

130
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,400
So we shall assist the chairman together.

131
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,600
He is recovering now.

132
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,280
I believe he will come back

133
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,650
to lead our company right away.

134
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,840
What happened?

135
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,430
I prevented them just in time

136
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,870
and spoiled their plot.

137
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:49,910
Dad,

138
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:50,720
Mom,

139
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,040
don’t worry.

140
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,670
Ziqian and I

141
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:54,980
will take care of the company business together.

142
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,160
Don’t worry!

143
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:00,830
Ziqian,

144
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,970
Junhao is out of contact

145
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,170
and rumors are spreading in the group.

146
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:12,290
I don’t think I will stand it

147
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,490
for long due to my health conditions.

148
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:21,750
Ziqian,

149
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,970
you must withstand

150
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,770
this crisis for me.

151
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:30,360
Uncle,

152
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,370
take it easy.

153
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,390
We will settle

154
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,250
the company businesses well.

155
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,420
Ziqian,

156
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,720
I am sorry.

157
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:57,790
Dad.

158
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,590
That is enough.

159
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:00,850
Stop talking.

160
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,000
Take a rest.

161
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:02,730
Stop talking.

162
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,820
Why did Uncle Shan say sorry to me?

163
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,270
Maybe he felt sorry

164
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:35,980
for not having taken good care of you

165
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,230
after your parents’ death.

166
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:40,980
Do you think so?

167
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:42,980
Yes.

168
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,860
It is so boring.

169
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,480
Don’t move. Your foot hasn’t recovered.

170
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:04,130
Staying in bed sucks.

171
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:06,340
When do you think my foot will recover?

172
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:11,630
Qianyu,

173
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,970
do you want to go out for a walk?

174
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,760
Yes, but I have to wait until I can walk.

175
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,040
Wait a minute.

176
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:20,900
Wait.

177
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,990
That is too troublesome.

178
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:49,450
Tonghao,

179
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:50,790
what are you doing?

180
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,460
Look,

181
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,830
it is the walking aid I made for Qianyu.

182
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:57,850
What do you think?

183
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:58,640
Tonghao,

184
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,610
you are a good doer.

185
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,850
My bedsheet!

186
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,400
It has accompanied me for nine years,
ten months and three days.

187
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,230
Why did you cut it?

188
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,910
The bedsheet is broken

189
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:19,870
and useless.

190
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:21,370
Tonghao,

191
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,920
you have made a big mistake.

192
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:25,990
It is a bedsheet specially purchased
when Chen and Qianyu’s father

193
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:27,470
got married.

194
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,060
Sorry,

195
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,860
Mama Jinzhi.

196
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,010
I didn’t know it.

197
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,980
Sorry.

198
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,680
It is my fault.

199
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:40,870
What’s wrong with the umbrella?

200
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,020
It is a new one

201
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,850
and I put it in the shop for sale.

202
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,540
I used it to block the sun for Qianyu.

203
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:51,610
What a big fool you are!

204
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:53,920
What’s up again?

205
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,010
Why are you quarreling here?

206
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,770
Just look at what Tonghao has done.

207
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:12,470
Is it for me?

208
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:18,290
Mom.

209
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:19,840
Don’t blame Tonghao.

210
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,920
He did it for me!

211
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,800
For you?

212
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:22,760
I think

213
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,160
he is just messing up everything.

214
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:24,930
He wastes water

215
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:25,390
and electricity

216
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:26,480
and eats much.

217
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,790
He even wants to date you.

218
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,880
I have invited a thief into our family.

219
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,350
Forget it.

220
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:36,500
He didn’t do it intentionally.

221
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,500
Don’t speak for him any longer.

222
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,140
Qianyu.

223
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:46,590
Taichu!

224
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:49,060
Taichu.

225
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,830
So nice to see you here.

226
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:50,800
Mama Jinzhi.

227
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,420
Is it also for Ye Qianyu?

228
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:53,930
Hmm.

229
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,830
I am coming to invite Qianyu to be my guide.

230
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,010
Qianyu has got her foot injured.

231
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,080
She can’t be your guide.

232
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,340
Why can’t she be a guide?

233
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,680
Her foot is injured

234
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,810
and of course, she has to use a wheelchair.

235
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,080
Taichu,

236
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,240
you are so considerate.

237
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,060
Come on.

238
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,170
Let me help you.

239
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:26,450
I will make something delicious for you
after you are back later.

240
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:27,360
Thanks.

241
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:27,650
Bye-bye.

242
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:28,340
OK.

243
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,330
Bye-bye.

244
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,300
I already told you.

245
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,180
You have no chance.

246
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,910
Come on, push me for fun.

247
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,720
Your invention can’t be wasted.

248
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:44,660
For fun?

249
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,350
Go do your homework.

250
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,910
I really feel sorry for you.

251
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,880
I borrowed this chair

252
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,440
from Mr. Tang.

253
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:19,540
It is a little old.

254
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,680
I hope you don’t mind.

255
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:24,560
Qianyu,

256
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,610
are you in a bad mood?

257
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:27,670
No, I’m good.

258
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,700
You’ve been inside the house for too long.

259
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,310
Yes.

260
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,960
I am bored to death.

261
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:36,840
Qianyu!

262
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,570
What are you doing here?

263
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:41,770
I am coming to play with you.

264
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:44,450
Look!

265
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:47,420
Is it a dolphin?

266
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:50,090
Tonghao,

267
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,370
that’s awesome!

268
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,080
It looks exactly the same as the white dolphin

269
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,000
we saw in the heavenly pit.

270
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:54,920
White dolphin?

271
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,150
Have you seen a white dolphin?

272
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:57,270
Yes.

273
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:59,990
Although we didn’t see a white dolphin
on the Dolphin Island,

274
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,410
we saw it in the heavenly pit of the Devil Forest.

275
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,590
Then I realized

276
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:05,740
the legend of Guanmei Fishing Villager was true.

277
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,030
It is a pity that

278
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:10,100
there is no path there.

279
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,420
Or I will take the tourists there

280
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,010
and charge them for a ticket.

281
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,160
Qianyu,

282
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,480
can you take me there

283
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,630
after your recovery?

284
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:18,710
I can take you there.

285
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:22,890
I mean

286
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,560
I want to have Qianyu beside me.

287
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:30,470
Alright.

288
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:32,220
Let’s go together after I recover.

289
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,430
See you!

290
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:47,500
Wish you happiness together!

291
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:50,150
Jinzhi!

292
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,120
Jinzhi!

293
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,100
Jinzhi!

294
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,060
Jinzhi!

295
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,830
I am not deaf.

296
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:00,180
You don’t need to yell so loudly.

297
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:03,160
Jinzhi!

298
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,320
Frankly,

299
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,260
I yelled loudly

300
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:07,440
so that all the neighbors

301
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:09,510
could know I’m here.

302
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:11,440
What do you mean?

303
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,140
In this way,

304
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,850
the widower next door

305
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,580
will know you have a boyfriend

306
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,860
and won’t harass you any longer.

307
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,480
What do you mean?

308
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,730
Look at yourself in the mirror.

309
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,800
So handsome,

310
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,710
charming,

311
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:35,520
charismatic

312
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:38,820
and attractive.

313
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,520
You are really sick.

314
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,030
So badly sick.

315
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,390
It is called

316
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,450
crazy fantasy.

317
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:54,910
Jinzhi!

318
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:56,900
Jinzhi!

319
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,440
You are absolutely right.

320
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,120
I just miss you too much.

321
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,520
I miss you when I am sleeping,

322
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,070
eating

323
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,990
and even in the bathroom.

324
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:05,640
Jinzhi!

325
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,630
You are so gross.

326
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:08,440
I am really sick of you.

327
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:09,930
Get away.

328
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:11,200
I don’t want to see you anymore.

329
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,200
I have some business for you.

330
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:12,940
Serious business.

331
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,240
You had better have serious business.

332
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:17,450
An Indonesia company

333
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,110
wants to hire some people
at Guanmei Fishing Village.

334
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:20,680
This is the advertisement.

335
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:23,320
You have many customers here.

336
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,910
Just help to distribute a copy

337
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:25,830
to each of your customers.

338
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,550
What can I get for it?

339
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,480
You will certainly benefit from it.

340
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,000
I have talked about it with them.

341
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:32,930
0.1 yuan for each leaflet

342
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:33,970
distributed.

343
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:43,490
OK.

344
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,480
Leave the leaflets and money here

345
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,170
and you can go away.

346
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,220
Here’s 20 yuan.

347
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:07,680
= Recruitment =

348
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,860
= Money Bag Grocery =

349
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,750
What?

350
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,950
Send Tonghao to work in Indonesia?

351
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,420
Check this leaflet.

352
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:25,140
Full boarding and lodging
with a monthly salary of 10,000 yuan

353
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,120
and also many bonuses and fringe benefits.

354
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:28,400
It sounds a good job.

355
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,010
But what can Tonghao do there?

356
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,220
As it says here,

357
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:36,210
young man aged 25 to 30.

358
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,440
But it doesn’t write the required skills.

359
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,870
Tonghao is certainly qualified.

360
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:43,110
Tonghao doesn’t speak the language.

361
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:45,060
Indonesia has many overseas Chinese

362
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,760
and the boss is also overseas Chinese.

363
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:48,170
But

364
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,290
Tonghao has lost his memory.

365
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,930
It has nothing to do with the job.

366
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,380
Although he has lost his memory,

367
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,020
he is hardworking.

368
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:58,540
But...

369
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:02,500
Tonghao.

370
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,710
Do you want to go there?

371
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:10,780
Listen,

372
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,460
you owe so much to us

373
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,380
and you can’t repay the debts
however hard you may work.

374
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:16,700
But you can if you go to work

375
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:18,240
in Indonesia just for a month.

376
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,130
If you really expect me to go there,

377
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,910
I will.

378
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,420
Help yourself!

379
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,680
They say Indonesia is very beautiful

380
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,690
and has lots of overseas Chinese.

381
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:36,950
You will feel homelike.

382
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,360
Don’t worry about homesickness there.

383
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,660
Tonghao,

384
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,630
don’t offend Chen.

385
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:52,580
Otherwise, you will be in trouble.

386
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:54,390
Stop talking nonsense!

387
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,640
Mom.

388
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:12,380
Do you want to send Tonghao to Indonesia?

389
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,440
Why would I want to have him here for New Year？

390
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,020
He wastes water

391
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:16,620
and electricity

392
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,770
and eats much.

393
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,680
He even wants to date you.

394
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,970
He must leave.

395
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,350
Can you...

396
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:29,820
No.

397
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,180
Well,

398
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,660
I did it for your good.

399
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:38,660
Taichu is your real Prince Charming

400
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,610
instead of the cheap Tonghao.

401
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:46,130
You must keep a distance from him.

402
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:09,280
How do you feel?

403
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,090
Isn't this one more comfortable than a wheelchair?

404
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:14,990
Tonghao.

405
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,570
Tell me the truth.

406
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,830
Do you really want to go to Indonesia?

407
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,540
No.

408
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,350
But am I justified to stay here?

409
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,650
If...

410
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:45,530
If you don’t feel good there,

411
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,080
you can come back any time.

412
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:55,670
In my memory,

413
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,620
it is my home here

414
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,880
and you are my family.

415
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:01,910
I will make lots of money and

416
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:02,820
take them back for you.

417
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:31,820
Mama Jinzhi.

418
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,070
I didn’t expect

419
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:47,020
you’d look like a rich guy being dressed up.

420
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,510
But,

421
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:51,660
just looks like one.

422
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,680
Where is Qianyu?

423
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,320
I don’t know.

424
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,160
By the way,

425
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,890
she asked you to take this toy frog.

426
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:23,270
Qianyu likes it very much.

427
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:24,740
She doesn’t allow others to touch it

428
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,200
and even places it beside her during sleeping.

429
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:28,170
I didn’t expect

430
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,330
she would give it away as a gift.

431
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:39,410
Tonghao,

432
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:41,680
please take this frog with you.

433
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,860
= Tonghao Please take this frog with you Qianyu =

434
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,860
I will pack some snacks for you.

435
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:53,440
Here.

436
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:59,600
So you won’t feel hungry on the way.

437
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:03,350
Thanks, Mama Jinzhi.

438
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:06,520
Tonghao,

439
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:07,940
let me see you off.

440
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,110
No.

441
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,720
Qianyu isn’t here

442
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:11,630
and you have to look after the shop.

443
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:13,080
I will go by myself.

444
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:19,940
Take this frog with you.

445
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,120
I think

446
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:33,420
Qianyu will need it more.

447
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,650
Goodbye.

448
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,260
He didn’t take it away.

449
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,710
What a silly guy!

450
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:23,890
Didn’t he know what I meant?

451
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,350
= Please take care =

452
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:36,800
Please take care.

453
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,090
Latest news.

454
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,680
The police just cracked

455
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,780
a case of dispatching

456
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,470
illegal laborers to Indonesia.

457
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:46,500
The agency attracted laborers

458
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,030
on the excuse of good working conditions

459
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:49,450
and high salaries

460
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:50,830
and dispatched them to Indonesia

461
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:51,940
and Malaysia.

462
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,480
Once they are cheated and go abroad,

463
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,410
the laborers will lose liberty.

464
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,950
The case involves lots of people.

465
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:58,500
The police reminds all citizens

466
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,630
not to be cheated

467
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:01,250
when you see the following leaflets.

468
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,890
The cell phone is expensive.

469
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:06,500
Where are you going?

470
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:16,840
There is no life vest left.
Come onboard right away.

471
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:41,800
Sit tight.

472
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,270
Untie the rope.

473
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,140
Tonghao!

474
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,010
Tonghao!

475
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,080
Tonghao!

476
00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:00,250
Tonghao, stop!

477
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,410
Tonghao!

478
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,920
Tonghao!

479
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:19,650
Tonghao!

480
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:21,310
Don’t go there!

481
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,430
Tonghao!

482
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:27,960
Tonghao!

483
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:28,870
Don’t go there!

484
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:30,250
Come back!

485
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:31,920
Tonghao!

486
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:35,890
Tonghao!

487
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:36,380
Qianyu!

488
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,550
Don’t go there!

489
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:40,430
The laborers are illegal on the leaflet!

490
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:41,150
It is a fraud!

491
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:41,810
Qianyu!

492
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:43,010
Don’t go there!

493
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,190
Come back!

494
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:44,950
What did you say?

495
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:46,090
I didn’t hear you!

496
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,240
Tonghao!

497
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:48,640
Tonghao!

498
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,080
Captain,

499
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:52,470
I have something urgent. Can we go back?

500
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:54,450
What’s so urgent?

501
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:55,840
I can’t go back after it leaves.

502
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,780
- If I go back, - Tonghao!

503
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,870
others will be delayed.

504
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:59,190
Come back!

505
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:00,160
Come back!

506
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,320
Tonghao!

507
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,130
Qianyu!

508
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:03,410
Wait a minute!

509
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:05,190
Come back!

510
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:07,400
Come back!

511
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:09,700
Tonghao!

512
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,280
Tonghao!

513
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:48,930
Tonghao!

514
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,090
Tonghao, wake up!

515
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:50,830
Tonghao!

516
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:51,850
Tonghao!

517
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:52,120
Tonghao!

518
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:52,940
Don’t scare me!

519
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,660
Tonghao!

520
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:57,940
Tonghao!

521
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,220
Tonghao, wake up!

522
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,220
Tonghao!

523
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:09,830
Tonghao!

524
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,690
Tonghao!

525
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,190
Tonghao!

526
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,770
Wake up!

527
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:16,730
You woke up.

528
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:17,770
Are you OK?

529
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:18,660
Are you OK?

530
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,190
Answer me.

531
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,860
Why did you jump if you couldn’t swim?

532
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,360
I was really scared.

533
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,640
I thought you were looking for me urgently.

534
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,680
The captain refused to go back.

535
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:39,170
So I had to jump into water.

536
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:41,620
Why didn’t you wear a life vest?

537
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,600
I was the last passenger

538
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,740
and there was no life vest left.

539
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,340
What a merciless human trafficker!

540
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,370
They don’t even have enough life vests.

541
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,340
Are you OK?

542
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,650
Are you OK?

543
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,540
What did you just say?

544
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,320
Human trafficker?

545
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,160
Yes.

546
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:10,040
They recruited illegal laborers with the leaflets.

547
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,140
If you go there,

548
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,640
you will die either on the way

549
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,070
or in a mine.

550
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,200
Really?

551
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,630
Thank you for saving me,

552
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,610
Qianyu.

553
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,900
You were so stupid to jump into water

554
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,460
when you couldn’t swim.

555
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,800
I lost my first kiss

556
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,130
just to save you last time.

557
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:44,560
Qianyu,

558
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,640
did you save me once?

559
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,260
Yes.

560
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:53,340
It is always bad luck for me

561
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:54,940
whenever I meet you.

562
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,290
Did you also

563
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,360
perform artificial breathing on me?

564
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,040
Yes.

565
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,330
It is your fault.

566
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:04,060
It is the second time.

567
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:09,490
Artificial breathing and kissing are different.

568
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:12,580
They are both  mouth-to-mouth touches.

569
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,570
What is the difference?

570
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:36,430
What are you doing?

571
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,530
Are you alright?

572
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,920
Do you know

573
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:48,940
the difference now?

574
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:51,570
What a rascal and swindler

575
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:52,580
you are!

576
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,740
I hope you had gone with them.

577
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:09,600
Qianyu!

578
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:12,730
I don’t want to go.

579
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:17,420
Just go.

580
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:18,680
The further, the better!

581
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,710
Don’t hurt me anymore.

582
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,230
I don’t want to leave you.

583
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:26,970
I want to be with you forever.

584
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,350
Tonghao,

585
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:33,950
here!

586
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,140
= Invitation Congratulations on being qualified
to sleep in Ye Shengzhe’s room =

587
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,140
You are the first

588
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,910
to get this letter of invitation.

589
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:45,700
Congratulations!

590
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,560
You don’t have to sleep in the warehouse anymore.

591
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:52,290
Thank you,

592
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:52,920
Shengzhe.

593
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:53,870
Have some meat

594
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,510
and then we can play Rubik’s Cube together.

595
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:56,540
OK.

596
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,610
Tonghao!

597
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,150
I really didn’t know

598
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:15,680
they recruited illegal laborers.

599
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:17,550
Otherwise, I wouldn’t
have allowed you to go there.

600
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,840
The meats

601
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,260
are all for you today.

602
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,020
Thanks, Mama Jinzhi.

603
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,020
It doesn’t matter.

604
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:26,820
I am back anyway.

605
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:55,780
Mama Jinzhi.

606
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:57,710
Actually,

607
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,490
I really owe you a lot

608
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:01,260
for having accepted me when I lost my memory.

609
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:03,460
I feel very homelike

610
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,290
and familiar here.

611
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,620
I can feel the warmth of home here.

612
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:08,790
I really know nobody

613
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:11,650
except you.

614
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:14,840
I don’t even know who I am.

615
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:16,910
So,

616
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:18,690
can I stay here?

617
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,090
I will leave after I get my memories back.

618
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:27,290
I will work hard

619
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,480
when I am here.

620
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:33,560
I will deliver all the orders in the future.

621
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:35,430
I agree to have Tonghao here.

622
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,030
Ye Qianyu,

623
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:46,660
how about you?

624
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:49,220
Why are you staring at Tonghao?

625
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,140
Did I do that?

626
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:53,750
No.

627
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,060
No, I didn’t.

628
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:18,920
I think it is better not to have him here.

629
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,840
What’s up?

630
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:25,250
Are you feeling ill?

631
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:26,240
Keep away from me.

632
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,580
I can’t eat when I see you.

633
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:31,990
He can work for free staying here.

634
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:48,350
Stop staring at me!

635
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,820
What secret research can prevent Shan Junhao

636
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,430
from giving us a call

637
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:00,710
or an email?

638
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:04,180
He can perform remote management

639
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,750
even if he is having a secret overseas research.

640
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:07,460
Considering the convenience
of communication today,

641
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:08,510
it is not hard

642
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:09,110
to make a call

643
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:10,050
or send a message.

644
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:12,880
Has Mr. Shan

645
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,630
gone to a primitive forest?

646
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:21,620
I have told you many times.

647
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,070
The No. 1 priority

648
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,150
is promoting the Guanmei project.

649
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:29,640
That is our No. 1 priority indeed.

650
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,710
But we need a leader for our company.

651
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:34,320
Chairman Shan is recovering.

652
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,880
I will send your regards

653
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:37,210
to him.

654
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,270
But our company

655
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:41,450
needs people who can really do something.

656
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,790
We must work together

657
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,360
and proceed with our work plans

658
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:49,940
so that Senwell won’t be at a loss

659
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,070
when Mr. Shan is absent.

660
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,620
Director Xu,

661
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,530
we have postponed

662
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:01,070
the scheduled date of demolition for one week.

663
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:03,690
Before the issue of Guanmei Hotel is settled,

664
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:05,360
the Guanmei project won’t start.

665
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,610
If it continues this way,

666
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:09,200
GQ Ventures will withdraw capital.

667
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:10,450
If it does,

668
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:11,600
our capital flow will be discontinued.

669
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:12,610
If that happens,

670
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:14,070
I’m telling you

671
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,850
the project will surely be busted.

672
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:18,400
I will go to Guanmei personally tomorrow

673
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:20,590
to sign the contract of Guanmei Hotel.

674
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:23,220
