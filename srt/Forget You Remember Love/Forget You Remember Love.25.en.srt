11
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,320
- Your coffee. - Thanks.

12
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,400
I whipped up this coffee especially for you.

13
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,080
I have no time for coffee.

14
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,590
Ada’ll give me an earful if she sees this.

15
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,630
Take a sip.

16
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:54,830
It won’t take long.

17
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,230
Thanks.

18
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,190
Hey, what’s her relationship with Taichu?

19
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,190
Why did he

20
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,870
bring coffee to a cleaner?

21
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,950
Don’t come to see me again.

22
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:08,750
We should keep a distance.

23
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,520
But why?

24
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:21,880
Taichu,

25
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,830
I’m going to work in Senwell Hotel.

26
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,880
Why?

27
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,030
Because there

28
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,190
I can get first-hand experience

29
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,080
to help me run Guanmei Inn.

30
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,080
Is it your idea

31
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,720
or someone else’s?

32
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,080
Director Fan told me that.

33
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,160
But I also think

34
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,000
it’s a good learning opportunity.

35
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,470
You’ll back me up, won’t you?

36
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,720
Of course I will.

37
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,470
I took you here

38
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,670
to help you grow quickly.

39
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,470
It’s just...

40
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:50,910
What?

41
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,670
I’m gonna miss you.

42
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,900
Why does he come so close to her?

43
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,830
Thanks for your coffee.

44
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,910
I’ll finish it later.

45
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,550
Make yourself at home, Taichu.

46
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,630
Thanks for driving Qianyu back every day.

47
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,910
Can you eat with us every day

48
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,670
so that I can always have shrimps?

49
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,800
I’d love to.

50
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:36,820
Taste it.

51
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,820
- Chen. - Thanks.

52
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,080
I’m going to work in Senwell Hotel tomorrow.

53
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,670
You mean

54
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,800
that five-star fancy hotel?

55
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,720
What’s your position?

56
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,750
You started as Taichu’s assistant.

57
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,030
Now, you must be

58
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:54,720
a hotel manager.

59
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,750
We have a manager in the house!

60
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,720
Qianyu.

61
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,830
You’re the most capable person in our village.

62
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,270
I’m so proud of you.

63
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:10,270
You no longer need to carry buckets

64
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:12,720
and they won’t call you bucket girl again.

65
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,270
They only gave her that name

66
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:18,440
because she’s as wide as a bucket.

67
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,160
Ye Shengzhe! Eat your food.

68
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,600
Eat up, eat up.

69
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,270
Taichu,

70
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,440
you studied Guanmei for long

71
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,440
and you should be familiar

72
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,510
with our customs.

73
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,230
Customs about what?

74
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,040
Mainly about weddings.

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,320
I don’t know much.

76
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:52,920
I can tell you.

77
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,670
People here are more traditional.

78
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,880
The groom should hire a matchmaker

79
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,760
to go to the bride’s house to propose.

80
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,510
Mom!

81
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,820
What are you talking about?

82
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,920
Betrothal presents are needed as well, right?

83
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,640
You’re brilliant!

84
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,670
The value

85
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:14,400
depends on how much

86
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,130
you love Qianyu.

87
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,640
What about Tonghao?

88
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:23,200
Forget about it.

89
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,230
Let’s eat shrimps.

90
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,480
Have some more.

91
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,320
You’re the first one ever

92
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,670
transferred here from the headquarters.

93
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,160
What did you do wrong?

94
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,830
Nothing.

95
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,950
I volunteered to work here.

96
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:04,320
There’s a Guanmei Inn in our village,

97
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,640
so I want to work here to gain more experience

98
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,230
to upgrade our Inn.

99
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,320
You compared your hovel

100
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,920
with our super five-star hotel?

101
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,440
Senwell is ultra-luxurious.

102
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,640
Only those who meet

103
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,270
the following two requirements can work here.

104
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:25,950
First, majored in hotel management.

105
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:29,440
Second, a bachelor’s degree or above is needed.

106
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,950
I don’t have the diploma

107
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,270
but I’ll work extra hard.

108
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,230
Please.

109
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,230
What can you do?

110
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:38,480
I can do anything.

111
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:40,640
Alright.

112
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,070
Start working in the Housekeeping Department.

113
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,070
Rooms of Senwell

114
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,350
represent the company’s image.

115
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:49,390
If you fail to do your job well,

116
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,600
I will

117
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,230
make you pay.

118
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,830
I won’t let you down.

119
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,270
OK.

120
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,070
You have a three-day trial period.

121
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,320
I don’t care what you did before

122
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,920
or who your referrer is,

123
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,160
but if you can’t get your job done...

124
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,270
I only care about results.

125
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:09,320
Yes.

126
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,350
Ye Qianyu!

127
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,800
What’s this?

128
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,920
Ye Qianyu!

129
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,000
Manager.

130
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,040
Ye Qianyu!

131
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,920
Ye Qianyu!

132
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,670
Chief Xie.

133
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,910
I’m Shan Junhao.

134
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,200
Welcome.

135
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,670
Rumor has it that Mr. Shan

136
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,690
never takes interviews.

137
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,700
We got rejected

138
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,270
more than once.

139
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:19,790
This time,

140
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:22,960
are you falling from the pedestal?

141
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,760
You have a good sense of humor.

142
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,000
Senwell Hotel is always low-profiled

143
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,670
and distant from media exposure.

144
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,440
We’ll close the gap in the future.

145
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,840
Well,

146
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:45,180
how will Senwell close the gap

147
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,880
this time?

148
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,230
Chief Xie.

149
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,150
We’ve prepared a special room for you.

150
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,280
What about my assistants?

151
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:58,560
Are they all your assistants?

152
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,470
What do you think?

153
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:09,030
OK. We’ll arrange deluxe rooms for them.

154
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,030
Deluxe?

155
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,640
Doesn’t sound good enough.

156
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,550
What do you propose?

157
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,000
When I interviewed Marv,

158
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,840
they emptied

159
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,470
an entire floor of presidential suites for me.

160
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,350
When I was working,

161
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,710
I could write in a noiseless environment

162
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,350
and I felt extremely inspired.

163
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,110
So,

164
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,910
how Focus

165
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,670
will portray Senwell

166
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,030
depends on our treatment,

167
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:48,830
correct?

168
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,080
Chief Xie.

169
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,590
We’ll provide you with the best service.

170
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,200
Please follow me.

171
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,880
Director Xu is more considerate.

172
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:09,740
Let’s go.

173
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:12,010
- Looks great! - Come on.

174
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,600
- Let’s go. - Let’s go.

175
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:23,710
“Noiseless”. “Extremely inspired”.

176
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,400
It’s bigger than I thought.

177
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,760
This is your suite.

178
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,950
Look. It’s well-decorated.

179
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,030
As you requested,

180
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,910
we’ve added more layers to the curtains.

181
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,200
Excellent.

182
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,790
Perfect for partying.

183
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,510
- Hope we can work well together. - Come in.

184
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,020
Let’s go.

185
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:01,180
Same here.

186
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,800
- Hey, let’s go check other rooms.
- There’s a piano!

187
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,820
I’ll leave you alone.

188
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:10,550
Party time!

189
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,230
Music! Music! Music!

190
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,280
Girls,

191
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,320
let’s drink and have fun tonight!

192
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:24,880
Yeah!

193
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,280
Fill the glasses.

194
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,790
According to the pre-interview discussion
with Xie Quan,

195
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,590
basically, the interview tends to be
more story oriented.

196
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:32,110
Tell more about what the public doesn’t know.

197
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,670
Most people lack in-depth knowledge

198
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:36,790
about Senwell.

199
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,640
We can focus more

200
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,640
on Senwell’s history and development,

201
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,200
which will enhance

202
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,880
the public’s trust in Senwell.

203
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:49,550
There are many stories to tell

204
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,470
about how our fathers founded this company.

205
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,670
Other than covering our history,

206
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,000
we can also tell people

207
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,000
changes we’ve made with the times.

208
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:03,520
That way, they can see we’re both traditional

209
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,670
and innovative.

210
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:10,790
Draft up a frame for the interview.

211
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,550
Yes.

212
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,670
Dawei.

213
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,590
Tell Xie Quan,

214
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,840
let’s have a discussion together

215
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,470
at 8 pm.

216
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,350
They can rest for now.

217
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,760
Yes, boss.

218
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,000
Mr. Xie

219
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,110
is a highly influential media correspondent.

220
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,470
Our service

221
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:29,280
directly determines

222
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,880
his impression of Senwell.

223
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,640
So every detail

224
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,110
must be flawless.

225
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,670
Now, Mr. Xie asks for an attendant

226
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,880
to serve him exclusively.

227
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,670
Who wants to be the volunteer?

228
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,320
Please step forward.

229
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,640
Good.

230
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,080
Ye Qianyu,

231
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,150
you’re the one.

232
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:00,150
Mr. Xie is a VIP guest.

233
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,470
I’m new here

234
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,080
and inexperienced.

235
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,520
I’m not sure if I can do it well.

236
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,960
That’s more the reason for you to try

237
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,000
and go through it.

238
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,320
What do I need to do?

239
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,320
Meet all his needs.

240
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,200
Remember,

241
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,640
guests are the kings.

242
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,000
All their needs

243
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,080
must be satisfied.

244
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,910
Do not cause our boss trouble.

245
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,160
Got it?

246
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,090
Oh.

247
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,550
I... I’m on it.

248
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:41,110
You girls

249
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,640
threw her under the bus!

250
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,960
My friend in Marv

251
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,080
served Chief Xie once.

252
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,960
Then she complained to me for hours.

253
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,710
I don’t want to be anywhere near him.

254
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:51,760
Yes. That’s right.

255
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,140
I also heard he’s super demanding.

256
00:14:59,180 --> 00:14:59,980
- Here. - Here.

257
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,340
Fill the glass. Cheers!

258
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,320
Cheers!

259
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,280
Cheers!

260
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,800
Another glass!

261
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:13,610
Here.

262
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,520
Mr. Xie,

263
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:17,640
hello,

264
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,440
I’m your personal attendant.

265
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:22,080
OK. Come here.

266
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:29,520
We’re gonna have a costume party.

267
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:30,590
OK.

268
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,550
Prepare everything on the list.

269
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,520
Can’t wait for it.

270
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,890
The list is long.

271
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:45,000
You have 30 minutes.

272
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,350
Go ahead.

273
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,590
Oh, yes.

274
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:50,570
Let’s continue.

275
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:51,500
- Here. - Yeah!

276
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,840
- Let’s drink. - Cheers!

277
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,950
Raise your glasses.

278
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,910
Cheers!

279
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,670
- Let me see. - Let me see.

280
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,470
I want this one.

281
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,910
This one is mine.

282
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,240
Put them on.

283
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,400
- I’ll go get changed. - Come on.

284
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,150
Hurry!

285
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,280
Why are you still standing there?

286
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,230
Go get changed.

287
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:52,960
Go ahead.

288
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:54,550
Go, go, go.

289
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,280
Oh.

290
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,230
Come here, girls. Sit here.

291
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:13,830
Come here.

292
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,710
Come here. Come on.

293
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:19,520
This is what I’m talking about.

294
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,070
Let’s drink.

295
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:21,830
Cheers!

296
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,380
Cheers, girls!

297
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,460
- Cheers! - Cheers!

298
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,590
Go away.

299
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,560
- Looking good. - Yeah.

300
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,520
Hey, you. Come here.

301
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:56,310
Come here.

302
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,590
Taste this.

303
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,310
Sit with me.

304
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,040
Mr. Xie,

305
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,520
I’m not allowed to sit.

306
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,560
I said sit down.

307
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,430
Do you know who I am?

308
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,190
Your boss Shan Junhao

309
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:25,590
has to

310
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,760
suck up to me.

311
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,100
This tastes pretty good.

312
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,090
You know

313
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,710
what you should do, right?

314
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,590
I don’t.

315
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,520
Don’t be scared.

316
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,800
Tons of chicks are eager to see me

317
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,430
but they can’t.

318
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,110
You should feel honored.

319
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:49,160
Mr. Xie,

320
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,280
please behave yourself.

321
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,160
Nobody has dared to give me this attitude.

322
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:04,830
Staff in your hotel,

323
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,680
from top to bottom,

324
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:08,920
are all similar to Shan Junhao,

325
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:11,830
cold, boring and rigid.

326
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,070
But that’s OK.

327
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:20,350
I love fierce chicks.

328
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:22,440
- One more drink. - Cheers!

329
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,350
- To you.

330
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,350
You disgusting perv!

331
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:45,360
Who do you think I am?

332
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,660
I can beat the brakes off you!

333
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,230
Do you know who I am?

334
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,310
You’re dead!

335
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,520
I offended Mr. Shan’s VIP guest.

336
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:02,710
Ye Qianyu, you’re screwed.

337
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:10,590
I’ll answer the door.

338
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,190
Ye Qianyu?

339
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:21,680
What are you doing here?

340
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,680
Where’s Chief Xie?

341
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,280
Are you alright?

342
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,920
Mr. Shan and Director Xu

343
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,640
are expecting you

344
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,230
to discuss interview questions for tomorrow.

345
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,400
After what you did to me,

346
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,160
you still want to be interviewed?

347
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,880
I demand an apology from Shan Junhao!

348
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,950
Ye Qianyu?

349
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,230
Why are you here?

350
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,760
I...

351
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,000
Yesterday,

352
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:28,320
Ye Qianyu was transferred to our hotel

353
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,080
to work in the Housekeeping Department.

354
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,160
And…

355
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:37,000
And she was assigned to serve Chief Xie.

356
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,590
Where’s Xie Quan?

357
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:42,070
He refused to attend our meeting

358
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:44,950
and demanded to see you.

359
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,880
See me for what?

360
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,590
I’m sorry, Mr. Shan.

361
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,400
I beat Mr. Xie.

362
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:54,680
What happened?

363
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:57,680
He got drunk

364
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,160
and tried to harass me.

365
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:00,560
I lost my temper.

366
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,350
How dare he harass our employee!

367
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:11,310
But this matter is serious.

368
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:14,160
It may damage

369
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,430
our hotel’s reputation,

370
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,520
or worse,

371
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:19,680
our entire company’s.

372
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,110
Mr. Shan,

373
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:27,680
Director Xu,

374
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,470
I’m willing to take full responsibility.

375
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,640
Director Xu.

376
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,950
What do you suggest?

377
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,640
Right now,

378
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,040
our only choice is to apologize.

379
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:38,470
I’ll go with Ye Qianyu.

380
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,000
Do I need a woman

381
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,190
to please others?

382
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,640
Dawei.

383
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:47,310
Call the manager of Housekeeping.

384
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,830
Hello, Mr. Li.

385
00:22:58,830 --> 00:22:59,640
Joey.

386
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,430
Give it to me.

387
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,230
Mr. Shan wants to talk to you.

388
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:04,800
I forbid Ye Qianyu

389
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,920
to continue serving Xie Quan.

390
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,560
Yes, boss.

391
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,950
And she isn’t allowed

392
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:10,830
to attend any VIP guests.

393
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:12,760
Yes, boss.

394
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,040
For those who ask for personal service,

395
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,950
assign at least two attendants,

396
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:19,430
male and female each.

397
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,560
Understand?

398
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:22,680
Yes, boss.

399
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,350
What do you plan to deal with it?

400
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,160
Tell PR to handle it.

401
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,350
Go ahead.

402
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,680
OK.

403
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,000
Ye Qianyu, you can go home.

404
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,350
Oh.

405
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:01,190
The staff is off work.

406
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:03,160
I’ll come and get my walking paper tomorrow.

407
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,280
I mean you can get off work.

408
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,000
Am I not fired?

409
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,160
Thank you, Mr. Shan.

410
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:25,680
Why is Ye Qianyu working in our hotel?

411
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:31,430
I think Director Fan recommended her.

412
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,830
Chief Xie.

413
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:38,110
I’m here to apologize on behalf of Senwell.

414
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:41,470
Where’s Shan Junhao?

415
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:42,920
Why didn’t he come?

416
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,880
He won’t be here.

417
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,520
You can tell me

418
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,640
what you need.

419
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,040
Then don’t waste my time.

420
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,590
Our attendant said

421
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:57,520
you harassed her first.

422
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,520
Is this how you apologize?

423
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,800
Senwell won’t cave in to your demands

424
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:15,160
and neither will Shan Junhao.

425
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,380
= Money Bag Grocery =

426
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,560
Oh, really?

427
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,110
She’s back.

428
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:39,430
Welcome back, Manager Ye!

429
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,950
Why are you all here?

430
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:43,400
Jinzhi told us you had made manager,

431
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,640
so we came to celebrate.

432
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,230
That gave us the excuse to buy a cake.

433
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,520
Qianyu,

434
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,760
you’re in charge of a five-star hotel.

435
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,110
That’s impressive!

436
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,160
I knew Qianyu

437
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,190
could excel in anything.

438
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:00,230
That’s right.

439
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,430
Let’s eat the cake.

440
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:04,110
OK.

441
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:04,820
- Yeah! - Let’s eat.

442
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:05,760
Sorry, guys,

443
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:07,470
I’m a bit tired.

444
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:08,800
I’d like to rest.

445
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,070
You guys enjoy it.

446
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:20,560
What happened to her?

447
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:21,950
Don’t know.

448
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:27,100
Oh, her work must be exhausting.

449
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,040
Let her rest.

450
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:29,040
We can eat.

451
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:30,660
- Let’s eat. - Cakes!

452
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:33,000
OK, come on.

453
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:53,160
Did I cause Shan Junhao

454
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,640
huge trouble?

455
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:09,430
Chief Xie.

456
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:11,590
Have a seat.

457
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:35,560
Chief Xie,

458
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,280
I’d like to talk about

459
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,040
the past and the present of Senwell.

460
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:44,040
When I interviewed Marv,

461
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:46,310
they offered me

462
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,280
special gifts.

463
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,760
Such as?

464
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:56,760
500,000 interview fee.

465
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,110
Chief Xie,

466
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,950
that won’t be a problem.

467
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,760
OK.

468
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,830
In my opinion,

469
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,160
stories about the hotel

470
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,950
are way less appealing than those about Mr. Shan.

471
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,560
What do you suggest?

472
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,110
Basically, history of Senwell Hotel

473
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:23,920
is about how founders

474
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,160
build it from scratch.

475
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,350
Nothing new.

476
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:29,400
Its current condition

477
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,470
is similar to other five-star hotels,

478
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,560
following the trend to make changes.

479
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:38,000
People have read that a lot.

480
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,110
And your advice is?

481
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:46,070
I think Mr. Shan

482
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:48,640
is more attractive

483
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,430
than this hotel.

484
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:51,920
For example,

485
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,000
he made general manager at a young age.

486
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:58,680
He has a girlfriend who grew up with him

487
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:02,680
but he fell in love with a country girl

488
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,830
after he went missing.

489
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:16,280
My privacy

490
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,880
is irrelevant to Senwell.

491
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,590
But readers love that.

492
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:22,430
I heard

493
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:24,070
you went missing,

494
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,560
lost your memory

495
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:28,830
and became a villager

496
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,310
who then had a fling

497
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:33,430
with a country girl

498
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:36,110
and abandoned her ruthlessly.

499
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:42,350
If I can publish a story about that,

500
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,800
I’m sure readers will jump on it.

501
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,040
Mr. Shan!

502
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:00,160
What are you doing?

503
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,400
Shan Junhao,

504
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,430
you can be violent, too!

505
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,160
The way you beat him reminds me of Tonghao.

506
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,160
He never beat anyone, though.

507
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,190
Junhao!

508
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:39,950
Shan Junhao,

509
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,000
how dare you!

510
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:42,830
Good job!

511
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,350
Great! Bravo!

512
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,920
I’ll crush you!

513
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,040
As a prestigious media professional,

514
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,560
you extorted money from your interviewee

515
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,880
and harassed our female staff member.

516
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,400
You had this coming!

517
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:03,350
You deserve it!

518
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:04,920
Don’t you know the rule in our circle?

519
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:07,190
Focus wouldn’t interview anyone for free.

520
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,710
Or why would I speak for you

521
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:10,880
or promote your company?

522
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:17,350
Xie Quan,

523
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,160
we paid 270,000 RMB

524
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:21,640
for the wine you ordered yesterday.

525
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:25,000
Now, you ask for 500,000?

526
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:28,190
You’re utterly unethical!

527
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,040
Indeed.

528
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,470
By the way,

529
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,710
we’ll only cover your medical expenses.

530
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,590
Let me take you to the hospital.

531
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,830
Shan Junhao,

532
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:11,710
- you’ll regret it! - You deserve it.

533
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:38,230
Mr. Shan,

534
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:45,310
I’ve never seen you throw punches before.

535
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:49,280
Really?

536
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,430
Scum like him deserves it.

537
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,040
Honestly,

538
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,070
you were so manly just now!

539
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:59,070
Really?

540
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:00,070
Yes.

541
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:05,920
Junhao!

542
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,920
Junhao, I heard you beat Xie Quan up.

543
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,820
Is that true?

544
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:10,400
Yes.

545
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,350
News travels fast.

546
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,590
The whole company knows it.

547
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,310
What happened?

548
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:16,190
Director Fan.

549
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,040
It’s not Mr. Shan’s fault.

550
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:19,830
That man asked for it.

551
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:20,560
But...

552
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,760
Junhao,

553
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,920
you’ve never been so reckless before.

554
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:28,280
You know he’s famous.

555
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,040
Alright.

556
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:35,830
I want to go home early to eat with Mom.

557
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,350
Let’s go.

558
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:43,950
Junhao!

559
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,190
My fellow reporters,

560
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,950
see the injury on my head?

561
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,560
Shan Junhao did it.

562
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,640
General manager of such a big company

563
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,400
is defiant and violent.

564
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,310
= Diagnosis Report =
This is my injury assessment report.

565
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:06,160
Shan Junhao must pay for his action.

566
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:08,520
Come in.

567
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,000
Boss,

568
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:12,600
bad news.

569
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:16,430
= This is how Senwell Hotel treats its guests. =

570
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:19,560

= Justice =

00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,800
= will be served. =

577
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,080
Mr. Shan.

578
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:36,320
He’s just a clown.

579
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:37,800
Junhao,

580
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:39,870
did you watch the news?

581
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:40,710
I did.

582
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,080
We must issue a clarification immediately.

583
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,840
I won’t waste time

584
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,470
on such a shameless jerk.

585
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,800
But this matter will draw criticism

586
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,760
to Senwell.

587
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,320
I feel

588
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:56,230
Xie Quan is acting against us on purpose

589
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,470
to set us up.

590
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:01,430
What is he up to?

591
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:04,470
GM of Senwell, Shan Junhao,

592
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:05,430
assaulted someone?

593
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:05,980
Gosh!

594
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:06,860
Hey, read the news.

595
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:07,910
Is it real?

596
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:10,420
= Shan Junhao Demands a False Report =
= Xie Quan Turns Him Down =

597
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,380
This must be fake news.

598
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,620
= Xie Quan Turns Him Down =
= Shan Junhao Assaults Him =

599
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:21,120
Gosh!

600
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,560
Mr. Shan is on the top search list.

601
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:23,840
Look.

602
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:26,120
GM of Senwell, Shan Junhao,

603
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,120
assaulted someone.

604
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:28,190
How did it happen?

605
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:29,780
Yeah. I don’t believe it.

606
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,120
What happened?

607
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,320
Why did he do that?

608
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:35,230
Have you cleaned all the rooms?

609
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,840
Stop gossiping around.

610
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:39,080
Go back to work.

611
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,230
Manager,

612
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:44,280
may I take a two-hour leave?

613
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:46,870
I have an emergency.

614
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:51,280
Denied.

615
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:02,840
Jinzhi.

616
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,560
Jinzhi.

617
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:08,080
Jinzhi.

618
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,710
You look exceptionally stunning!

619
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:12,800
Something good must’ve happened.

620
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,190
Nothing. It’s just...

621
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,950
My daughter Qianyu has become a manager

622
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:18,630
in Senwell Hotel.

623
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,190
Not everyone can get that chance.

624
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:23,000
Senwell Hotel?

625
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:25,560
I heard that hotel

626
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:27,190
is luxurious.

627
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:28,800
I’ve never been there once.

628
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,320
Neither have I.

629
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:31,430
But now,

630
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:33,320
Qianyu is an important figure there.

631
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,150
I can go there anytime.

632
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:37,630
Jinzhi,

633
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,840
hey,

634
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,360
can you bring me with you

635
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,870
when you go there?

636
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,520
Jinzhi.

637
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,080
Jinzhi.

638
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,000
Jinzhi!

639
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:58,190
Sorry, Mr. Shan won’t take interviews.

640
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:59,280
You should leave.

641
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:00,520
Let us in.

642
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:01,630
We’ll only ask a few questions.

643
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:03,470
Yes. We won’t take up too much of his time.

644
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:05,000
We need to know the truth.

645
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:10,390
Taichu.

646
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:14,800
What’s going on?

647
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,190
I saw many people criticize Shan Junhao

648
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:17,150
on the Internet.

649
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:18,150
Yes.

650
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,910
It has attracted GQ’s attention, too.

651
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,390
They might withdraw their funds.

652
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:25,150
This matter has a huge negative impact.

653
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,910
According to the strategic agreement,

654
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:29,470
if Senwell makes huge mistakes,

655
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,870
GQ won’t pay for them.

656
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,710
Investors only seek profits.

657
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,950
The agreement will automatically become invalid.

658
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:36,870
As for how it will end,

659
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:38,470
it depends on the progress.

660
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,360
But Xie Quan provoked him first.

661
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,320
He extorted money from Shan Junhao.

662
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,630
Unacceptable!

663
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,870
How did you know?

664
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,190
I saw it

665
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:51,840
and recorded the whole thing.

666
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,470
Shan Junhao said in the video

667
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:01,000
that Xie Quan harassed an attendant.

668
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,870
Was it you?

669
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:06,270
- It won’t take long. - Yeah.

670
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:08,670
Forgive me. No comments from Mr. Shan.

671
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,040
Qianyu.

672
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,840
Why didn’t you

673
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,320
tell me about it?

674
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,120
Don’t worry.

675
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,520
I’ve taught him a lesson.

676
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,150
Still, I’m at fault

677
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:20,390
for what happened.

678
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:22,080
Or, Xie Quan wouldn’t have targeted Senwell.

679
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:23,760
So,

680
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:25,500
I want to clarify this incident for Shan Junhao.

681
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:27,260
Mr. Shan doesn’t do interviews.

682
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,280
This video

683
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,360
can turn things around.

684
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:31,670
Really?

685
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,280
Then let’s show it

686
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,080
to the reporters.

687
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,000
Wait.

688
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,600
This video

689
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,600
concerns Senwell’s crisis management strategy.

690
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,560
Give it to Shan Junhao and let him handle it.

691
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,360
OK.

692
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:44,800
Let’s go see him now.

693
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:49,630
Qianyu, if such things happen again,

694
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,360
I want you to tell me immediately.

695
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,520
OK?

696
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:53,980
OK.

697
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,000
Let’s go.

698
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,140
Sorry, no comments from Mr. Shan.

699
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,420
We can’t just wait.

700
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,180
Right.

701
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:05,120
Is Mr. Shan in his office?

702
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,630
Hello. He’s in a meeting.

703
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:09,360
I’ll wait for him here.

704
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,190
Qianyu.

705
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,150
Send me the video

706
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,600
and go back to work.

707
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,600
When I see him,

708
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,280
I’ll give it to him.

709
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:21,280
Alright.

710
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,280
I’ll send it to you.

711
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,150
See you.

712
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:23,630
Bye.

713
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,000
Mr. Shan,

714
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,670
Senwell Hotel’s occupancy rate

715
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:30,800
is nosediving.

716
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,040
Many VIP guests canceled their rooms.

717
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:36,080
Our losses

718
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:38,910
are all caused by you.

719
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:42,280
Other than the hotel,

720
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:45,670
the share price is almost plunging to the limit.

721
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,800
Investors on the fence

722
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,280
are wavering.

723
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,560
If they withdraw their funds,

724
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,280
we’ll suffer a huge loss.

725
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,360
Right now,

726
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:55,190
Mr. Shan must issue

727
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:57,150
an apology to Xie Quan and the public.

728
00:39:57,150 --> 00:40:00,710
Xie Quan made groundless accusations

729
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:03,280
and brazenly extorted bribes.

730
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:07,150
Why should I apologize to him?

731
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:09,360
Can you prove he’s the one at fault?

732
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:12,520
Do you have proof that he extorted bribes?

733
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:13,670
No.

734
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:16,950
You can’t put your pride behind even till now?

735
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,000
Do you want to drag Senwell down with you?

736
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,760
Xie Quan wouldn’t attack Senwell

737
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,000
without a reason.

738
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,950
There’s more to this incident.

739
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:28,280
Marv is most likely to be the mastermind.

740
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,760
We must investigate it thoroughly.

741
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:32,280
Nevertheless,

742
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:35,120
you must apologize first

743
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,840
to appease criticisms.

744
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:39,360
My compromise

745
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:43,230
will only embolden that shameless jerk.

746
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:48,120
I will not apologize.

747
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,280
Dismissed.

748
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,080
Tell the outsiders

749
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,360
“no comment”

750
00:40:58,150 --> 00:40:59,630
and wait for further orders.

751
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,040
If this incident continues to boil,

752
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,950
we can remove Shan Junhao from his post.

753
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,080
But the collateral damage will be huge, too.

754
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:18,000
That’s not what I want to see.

755
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:19,320
Mr. Zhang,

756
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,560
if you want something,

757
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:25,230
you should pay for it.

758
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:30,040
The company’s losses are Shan Junhao’s mistakes.

759
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,840
The bigger the loss, the bigger the mistake,

760
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,470
or how could we bring him down?

761
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,600
I know

762
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:39,840
but the damage

763
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,870
can’t go out of control.

764
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,000
The rest depends on you and the board.

765
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,430
The board is already unsatisfied with him.

766
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,190
Xie Quan keeps fanning the fire.

767
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:51,320
If Marv is really the one behind him,

768
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,000
things will be different.

769
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,870
This is the legendary Senwell Hotel?

770
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,840
No wonder you spent two hours doing makeups

771
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,280
and put on your most expensive dress.

772
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:26,040
We can’t embarrass your sister.

773
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:27,840
Let me see.

774
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:31,560
How do I look? Good enough?

775
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,390
Yeah. Good.

776
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,080
Smile.

777
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,910
Hello. Do you have a reservation?

778
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:48,000
We’re here to see Ye Qianyu.

779
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:49,600
Which room is she in?

780
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:50,800
No,

781
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:53,800
she works here.

782
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:56,120
She’s your manager.

783
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:59,910
I don’t think we have a manager with that name.

784
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,150
She’s new.

785
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:04,710
You probably don’t know her.

786
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:07,630
Why don’t you call her to confirm it?

787
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:10,950
We’re here to surprise her.

788
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,760
She can’t know about our visit.

789
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:17,080
Can you tell us

790
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,800
where the manager’s office is?

791
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:19,630
Sorry,

792
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:21,230
we have more than one manager.

793
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:23,280
All visitors must make appointments first.

794
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:28,120
Ye Qianyu!

795
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:29,280
Chen, look.

796
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,560
It’s work time.

797
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,080
How dare you sneak out!

798
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,120
You want to be fired?

799
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,000
Sorry, manager.

800
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:40,000
I had an emergency.

801
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,630
What emergency?

802
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:43,150
I’ll clean the rooms now.

803
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:46,560
Chen, he’s bullying Qianyu.

804
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:58,390
May I borrow a pen and a piece of paper?

805
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:00,600
Thank you.

806
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,630
Thanks.

807
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,320
Can you please give this to Ye Qianyu?

808
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,800
She’s a staff member.

809
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,120
That’s her phone number.

810
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,080
Thanks.

811
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,150
OK. You’re welcome.

812
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:30,840
Chen.

813
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:32,840
Ye Qianyu got bullied.

814
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:34,630
Why didn’t we step up to help her?

815
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,360
If we did,

816
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:40,800
it’d dent her pride even more.

817
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:49,600
That Taichu!

818
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,840
How could he give her such a job?

819
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:57,360
I’ll teach him a lesson.

820
00:44:57,710 --> 00:44:59,390
Hello, I’m Ye Qianyu.

821
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:01,840
I was told to pick up something at the front desk.

822
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:03,560
Yes. A woman

823
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:05,670
came with a boy to bring you this earlier.

824
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:08,000
They said it was a surprise.

825
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:30,780
