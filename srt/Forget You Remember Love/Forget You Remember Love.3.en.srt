Spring is the season when everything thrives.

Try to plant a seed

14
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,460
and let it grow together with us.

15
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,310
Peanuts we eat are seeds.

16
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:01,250
Catkins are willow’s seeds.

17
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,060
I never thought one peanut

18
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,870
could yield so many…

19
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,050
Aunt,

20
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,030
is Qianyu here?

21
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,830
You’re here for Ye Qianyu?

22
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,070
She’s delivering goods. She’ll be back in a while.

23
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,000
Would you come in and have some tea?

24
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:30,920
No, thanks.

25
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,400
Nice car you got here.

26
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,360
Handsome, what do you do?

27
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,750
Me?

28
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,600
I travel all year long.

29
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,330
Not some kind of decent work.

30
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,600
Traveler! You must be rich…

31
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,150
In mind.

32
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,150
How old are you? Are you married?

33
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,520
I’m 26.

34
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,620
Not married.

35
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:01,210
My daughter, Qianyu, is 24,

36
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,050
the beauty of the village.

37
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:03,570
She can be genteel and tough.

38
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,680
Do you want to consider about her?

39
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,080
Chen,

40
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,890
I think you’re too eager.

41
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:09,460
Hush!

42
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,270
Taichu!

43
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,040
Ye Qianyu.

44
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,700
What brings you here?

45
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,580
I come by to return the cup.

46
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:21,790
Glad you’re back.

47
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:22,720
Thank you.

48
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:24,670
Where else do you want to go?

49
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:25,630
I can guide you.

50
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,790
No, thanks. I want to go around on my own.

51
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,230
I’d better go.

52
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:30,260
Bye-bye.

53
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:31,880
Bye!

54
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,200
Bye-bye.

55
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:35,650
Bye-bye.

56
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:36,700
Bye-bye.

57
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:45,130
It must be Chen’s enthusiasm

58
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,330
that frightens him.

59
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:51,610
Chen,

60
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,400
what did you say to him?

61
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,610
Nothing particularly.

62
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,740
I had a blind date with him on behalf of you.

63
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,090
Let me tell you.

64
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,090
Don’t let

65
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:02,150
any of these rich men slip by.

66
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,750
Are you listening to me?

67
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,130
Really. Do you hear me?

68
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,610
Listen, to these rich men,

69
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,980
next time, you must…

70
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,690
Hey!

71
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:12,090
Are you listening to me?

72
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:37,090
Daisy!

73
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:38,620
Daisy!

74
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:39,490
Breakfast!

75
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:10,940
Yunyi, Junhao!

76
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:13,680
Ziqian.

77
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,160
You’ve decided to get engaged?

78
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,600
Good luck to you.

79
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,450
Ziqian’s been leading a married life ages ago.

80
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,960
He attends Daisy like a wife.

81
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:30,760
Junhao,

82
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,110
let’s start out at 3 p.m. from the company.

83
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:36,080
Sorry, Yunyi.

84
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,620
I need to go to Guanmei Fishing Village.

85
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,590
But we need to order the gown and suit soon.

86
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,150
Otherwise, it’ll be too late.

87
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,900
Go for me, please.

88
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,690
Me again?

89
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,040
Would you let me go to your wedding for you?

90
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:05,660
You think too much.

91
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,060
Just try the suit.

92
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,520
I’m not going.

93
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,190
Ziqian.

94
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,640
All right, I’ll go.

95
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:25,510
Morning, Mr. Shan.

96
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:36,490
Wait!

97
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:37,610
Wait! Wait!

98
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:38,950
Hold on.

99
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,360
Wait! Wait!

100
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,910
Where are you taking this piano?

101
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,250
It’s sold.

102
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,060
Su Liyin!

103
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,320
Su Liyin!

104
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,990
What?

105
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:53,450
Ye Qianyu,

106
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,270
what are you howling about?

107
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,380
What is this?

108
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,330
Didn’t you promise not to sell the piano?

109
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,900
The customer paid the earnest money.

110
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,750
Today, I got the final payment.

111
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,970
For what reason should I keep it?

112
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:08,440
Didn’t you say you’d raise enough money in 3 days?

113
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:09,200
Where is it?

114
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,160
That’s why I came by.

115
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,890
This is all the money I got.

116
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,670
It’s 4,200 yuan. Take it.

117
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:17,880
Keep the piano, please.

118
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:22,170
Ye Qianyu, are you kidding me?

119
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,230
I promise

120
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,050
I’ll make up the rest soon.

121
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,290
Give me a week.

122
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,130
No, 3 days will be fine.

123
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,120
No way.

124
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:32,080
Take it.

125
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,500
I can’t let you sell it.

126
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,080
Ye Qianyu!

127
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,170
Get off now!

128
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,730
I don’t allow you to sell the piano!

129
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,940
You’re being perverse!

130
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,520
Yes, I am. So what?

131
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,110
Get up!

132
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,540
No, I won’t!

133
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:53,560
About the ITA representative,

134
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,420
what have you learned?

135
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,020
All I’ve learned so far

136
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,150
is that he’s a travel celebrity on Weibo

137
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:58,070
with over 10 million fans.

138
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,930
His nickname on Weibo is Flying Blade.

139
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:02,300
But on his Weibo page,

140
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,270
there’s no showing face on all his photos. So,

141
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:05,520
I don’t know what he looks like.

142
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,260
The ITA guy is here to make assessment.

143
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:09,940
He’ll come to Guanmei Fishing Village.

144
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,240
Pay more attention

145
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,930
to visitors coming and leaving the village.

146
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,070
OK.

147
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,060
Yes, I’m being perverse!

148
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,580
You get up!

149
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,560
No. No. No, I won’t!

150
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,720
Get off. Get off.

151
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,110
Stop it. Stop making a scene.

152
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,390
What’s going on?

153
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,210
Uncle Li,

154
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,720
Ye Qianyu is stopping me from doing business.

155
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,830
Help me talk to her.

156
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,120
Qianyu,

157
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,600
let’s talk about it. How could you…

158
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,540
As long as Su Liyin agrees not to sell the piano,

159
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,420
it’s negotiable.

160
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,770
I will sell it today!

161
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:39,670
Are you getting off it or not?

162
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:40,610
No, I’m not!

163
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,860
I won’t!

164
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,960
Stop. Stop it.

165
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,040
Come on. Stop it.

166
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:45,810
You two, give me a sec.

167
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:46,760
Let me make a call.

168
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,760
The texture is too bright.

169
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,890
Mr. Shan won’t like it.

170
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,820
Change the color to black.

171
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,760
You do have his sizes, right?

172
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,440
Mr. Shan is a regular customer.

173
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,690
The latest sizes we know are from a month ago.

174
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,820
If his figure remains the same,

175
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,300
I’ll place an order with those sizes.

176
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:01,900
Remember.

177
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:04,060
No wools in his suit.

178
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,060
He’s allergic to wools.

179
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,340
Yes. Got it. We’ll pay attention to it.

180
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,370
Ziqian, do I look good?

181
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,520
Great!

182
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:52,830
You look great in every dress.

183
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,770
Miss Fan, let’s take a final makeup photo.

184
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:57,320
OK.

185
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,170
OK, smile.

186
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:07,820
Ziqian.

187
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,150
Let’s take a photo together.

188
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,740
I’ll pass.

189
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,440
Come on.

190
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,730
I’d rather not.

191
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,500
Come over here.

192
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,570
- All right - Come on.

193
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,270
Be brighter, both of you.

194
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:29,700
Good.

195
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,780
- Thank you. - Thank you.

196
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,670
Ziqian, I like this dress so much.

197
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:40,150
But Junhao prefers white.

198
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,010
I think this one suits you.

199
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,130
You can discuss with him.

200
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,470
Forget it. I’d better choose the white one.

201
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,580
Jinzhi.

202
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,640
It’s me, Donglu.

203
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,240
You’d better come. As fast as you can.

204
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,890
Well, Su Liyin…

205
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,750
Su Liyin and Qianyu… They are fighting.

206
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,300
Yeah, yeah. Yes. At Su Liyin’s piano store.

207
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,030
Right. Yes.

208
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:18,810
You’d better hurry.

209
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,140
What’s going on?

210
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,920
The truck in front blocks the way.

211
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:32,610
Forget about her.

212
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,600
Take her

213
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,080
and the piano away!

214
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:36,960
No, you can’t.

215
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,620
Don’t take it away.

216
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,900
You can’t.

217
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,110
No!

218
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:42,910
Please don’t.

219
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,200
Don’t!

220
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:46,190
Su Liyin, I beg you.

221
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:48,020
Can you please not let them take it away?

222
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,190
I beg you.

223
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,900
I can’t let you.

224
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:53,920
Liyin,

225
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,480
take this.

226
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,220
What’s this?

227
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,480
I hate Ye Qianyu.

228
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,210
She’s vulgar and stingy.

229
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,660
She fights with me over food every day.

230
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,910
And she’s not pretty like you.

231
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,720
But I really can’t put up with what she’s doing.

232
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,240
I can’t put up with it, either.

233
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,520
But Shengzhe,

234
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,650
it’s not enough.

235
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,150
And mine, too.

236
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,150
Mom, what are you doing here?

237
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,720
I called Jinzhi to come over.

238
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,960
It’s still not enough.

239
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,420
Su Liyin,

240
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,310
please.

241
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,700
Can you please not sell the piano?

242
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,500
This is the only thing my mom left for me.

243
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:43,090
I promise.

244
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,540
I’ll make up the rest in 3 days.

245
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:48,150
I beg you. Please don’t sell it.

246
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:49,120
Please.

247
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:54,830
I…

248
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:57,630
It’s not that I’m being unreasonable.

249
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,710
It’s just I accepted the earnest money.

250
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:01,860
I’ll have to pay double if I break the deal.

251
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,720
With the fine,

252
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,340
this is far from enough.

253
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:07,280
Aunt, take the money.

254
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,030
Qianyu,

255
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:10,810
don’t make it difficult for me.

256
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:13,120
Uncle Li,

257
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,820
talk to Qianyu for me.

258
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,980
The client is waiting for me.

259
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,450
I can’t keep doing this any longer.

260
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:28,350
Qianyu, why don’t you

261
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:29,910
go back for now?

262
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:32,590
Look, with these people and the truck here,

263
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,040
the traffic is jammed.

264
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,970
Passengers behind there must be angry.

265
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,090
Don’t make it difficult for me.

266
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:45,280
No. I can’t!

267
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,840
You can’t take it away!

268
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:47,280
Qianyu.

269
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:47,630
Don’t!

270
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:48,450
It’s OK. It’s OK.

271
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,080
Qianyu.

272
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:49,520
I can’t. No!

273
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,300
We’ll think of something.

274
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,190
Uncle Li! Uncle Li!

275
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:53,290
Uncle Li, tell them to stop, OK?

276
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:54,630
- Let’s go back and work out a plan. - No!

277
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:55,120
It’ll be OK.

278
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,550
That’s the only thing my mom left for me.

279
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,360
All right. You’re fine.

280
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:58,890
Uncle Li.

281
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:01,140
It’s OK. Let’s go home and think of something, OK?

282
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,750
I don’t want to!

283
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:03,580
All right. All right.

284
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,730
You think I would believe you again?

285
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:07,660
If you didn’t go against your word,

286
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,550
I’d have bought my mom’s piano back.

287
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,260
It’s OK, Qianyu.

288
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,350
Don’t be upset.

289
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,030
When we make enough money,

290
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,180
we will

291
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,620
buy it back.

292
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,230
OK?

293
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,680
How about this?

294
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,470
I’m going to cook your favorite braised pork.

295
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:32,280
OK?

296
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:36,800
All right. OK.

297
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,340
Don’t cry. Dry your tears.

298
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,780
All right. Put it down here.

299
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,540
Over here.

300
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:50,670
What is going on?

301
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:51,350
Thank you.

302
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:53,780
Ye Qianyu,

303
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,880
you’re so lucky.

304
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:56,160
Someone paid me

305
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,930
to send the piano here for you.

306
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,780
Who bought it for me?

307
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,940
How could I know?

308
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:04,080
But as soon as you left, someone contacted me

309
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,090
and paid double the price to send it to you.

310
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,970
When did you meet a man so rich?

311
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,340
I didn’t know such a rich man.

312
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,070
It’s all right.

313
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,250
Anyway, the piano

314
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,350
belongs to you.

315
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,680
I have to go. Bye, aunt.

316
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:35,000
The piano is mine.

317
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,710
But…

318
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,520
Who bought it?

319
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,560
Yes, who was it?

320
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,520
Was it

321
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:51,710
Taichu?

322
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:52,770
Taichu?

323
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,180
It’s

324
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,390
the cabriolet guy.

325
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,270
Where do we put the piano?

326
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,430
In Qianyu’s room. Put it in Qianyu’s room.

327
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:08,210
Second floor.

328
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,650
Put on my coat armor

329
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,880
and take the cabriolet guy down.

330
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,340
Is it too gaudy?

331
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,250
Remember.

332
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,230
Tell him you made the cookies by hands.

333
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,290
Fighting, big sister!

334
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,000
Get me a rich brother-in-law

335
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,610
and be generous with my pocket money.

336
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:52,590
Go!

337
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,620
= Guanmei Hotel =

338
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:56,650
A pair of threes.

339
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:57,650
A pair of fives.

340
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:58,360
A pair of eights.

341
00:16:59,360 --> 00:16:59,810
A pair of queens.

342
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:03,750
Why don’t we

343
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:06,440
change hotel name to Card Game Fight the Landlord?

344
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,540
Ah, Qianyu.

345
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,010
Are you in love?

346
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:10,940
A pair of aces.

347
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,580
Qianyu,

348
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:14,620
you look pretty today.

349
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:15,780
Do I?

350
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,280
A pair of twos.

351
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:17,560
Pass, pass.

352
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:18,800
Your turn.

353
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,020
Qianyu,

354
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,130
there’s no need

355
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,150
to dress up so carefully to see us.

356
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:25,540
Humph, I’m not here for you.

357
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,340
Where are you going?

358
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,040
I want to meet Mr. Taichu.

359
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,090
Don’t bother. He went to the beach.

360
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:36,260
Why do you all come by for Mr. Taichu?

361
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,510
You have another single,

362
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:40,410
outstanding young man here.

363
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:42,290
Cut the nonsense.

364
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:44,040
Who else came by for him?

365
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,420
Oh, it’s Liyin.

366
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,170
Whose turn? Come on.

367
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:50,820
Taichu,

368
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,880
I made these cookies myself.

369
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:53,790
Take a bite.

370
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:54,960
No, thank you.

371
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,510
I don’t like sweets. Thank you.

372
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,130
Can you move aside, please?

373
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,360
You block my camera.

374
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,180
Oh.

375
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,160
Ouch!

376
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:30,690
My foot hurts like hell!

377
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:31,350
What’s up?

378
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:34,960
Taichu, I think I sprained my ankle.

379
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,570
I can’t walk. What now?

380
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:48,320
Su Liyin!

381
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,170
Your house is on fire!

382
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:51,300
Really?

383
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,950
Yes, so is the store.

384
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:53,830
You’d better go back now!

385
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,280
Oh,

386
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,380
didn’t you sprain your ankle?

387
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,740
How come you ran so swiftly?

388
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,290
Are you

389
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,760
coming with cookies, too?

390
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,180
Not at all.

391
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,460
I’m here to say thank you.

392
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,790
Although you say that a lot,

393
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,280
all I can reply

394
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:32,090
is you’re welcome.

395
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,200
By the way,

396
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,730
do you want to travel around?

397
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:37,260
I’ll give you free guide.

398
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,490
No, thanks. Someone else is taking me out.

399
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:40,050
See you.

400
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,740
Someone else?

401
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,140
Someone else?

402
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,200
Who?

403
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:20,440
Qianyu, you’re back.

404
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:24,660
Wait.

405
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,930
How come you’re so soon?

406
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,530
He doesn’t need a guide.

407
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,160
The cookies.

408
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:36,000
You have to give the cookies to him

409
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:38,600
so that he can tell you’re clever and deft.

410
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,210
Taichu doesn’t need cookies.

411
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,620
Plenty of girls wait to make it for him.

412
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:43,920
Let’s try cakes next time.

413
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,830
Don’t waste your time. He doesn’t give a toss.

414
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,300
It seems the rich man is hard to handle.

415
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:55,290
I need to work on my strategy.

416
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,880
OK, go deliver the goods. Hurry!

417
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:00,920
Go!

418
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:02,950
Hey,

419
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,990
invoices are in the car.

420
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,210
Just rent it to me.

421
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,070
No, no, no. I can’t.

422
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,470
I can raise the rent.

423
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,400
Listen, it’s not about the money.

424
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,970
Do you know how dangerous it is in Dolphin Island?

425
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,690
We’re responsible for your safety.

426
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,420
- How about… - Li!

427
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,520
Your water!

428
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:28,370
Ye Qianyu.

429
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:29,120
Taichu,

430
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:31,520
what are you doing here?

431
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,970
He’s imploring me

432
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:34,290
to rent a boat to Dolphin Island.

433
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,860
I dare not to.

434
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,920
Dolphin Island?

435
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,080
Why do you want to go?

436
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,550
I heard there are white dolphins.

437
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:41,820
So I want to prove if it’s true.

438
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:45,240
There’s no dolphin in Dolphin Island anymore.

439
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:46,240
Why?

440
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,600
That is a long story.

441
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,380
But I’m busy delivering goods now.

442
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,380
Why don’t you take me along

443
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,450
and tell me about it?

444
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,400
OK.

445
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:57,170
Come on.

446
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:57,600
Good.

447
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:02,720
Qianyu,

448
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:03,990
your clothes are torn.

449
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:05,080
Torn?

450
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:05,920
Where?

451
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,160
Where?

452
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:07,880
Shoulder.

453
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,370
Thanks.

454
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:22,320
Let’s go.

455
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,000
Once upon a time,

456
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,600
in the water surrounding Guanmei Islands,

457
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,420
there were plenty of white dolphins.

458
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:46,760
They usually lived in the water
around Dolphin Island.

459
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:49,560
Back then, Dolphin Island didn’t have a name.

460
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,140
When fishermen couldn’t find

461
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,770
their way back in heavy mists,

462
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,580
they followed dolphins’ songs

463
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,770
to come ashore.

464
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:05,460
Let me help you.

465
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:06,490
I’m OK.

466
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,340
My record is 4 barrels.

467
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,260
These things are pieces of cake.

468
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:13,000
Granny Zhou,

469
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,590
your water and rice.

470
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,160
I put them on the table.

471
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:21,290
See you.

472
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,380
I don’t know you’re so tough.

473
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,490
I am.

474
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,860
I have strong arms

475
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,580
and King Kong’s shoulders.

476
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:31,930
Let’s go.

477
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:35,310
Dolphins were fishermen’s best friends.

478
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,150
Never would anyone try to hurt them.

479
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,750
However, they disappeared all of a sudden.

480
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,630
In memory of them,

481
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,800
the fishermen named this island Dolphin Island.

482
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,700
There are lots of submerged rocks around it.

483
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,650
Incidents often happened to fishermen nearby.

484
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:50,060
The fishermen believed

485
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,970
it was because they lost white dolphins’ guide.

486
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:54,840
Few people dare to go there now.

487
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,290
Two Roasted Goose and Rice for Su Liyin.

488
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:04,410
One Braised Pork and Rice for Li Donglu.

489
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,510
Rice and two toothpastes for Wang Xiaoquan.

490
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,540
Two packages from Zhang Daming.

491
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,820
Two hours of cleaning services at Yang Xiaojuan’s

492
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,680
tomorrow.

493
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:15,600
Why do you take so many jobs?

494
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:19,510
This is my way of survival.

495
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,720
10 yuan for a take-out.

496
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,140
2 for a package.

497
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,240
100 for an hour of services.

498
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,110
The more you do, the more you make.

499
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,520
What do you make so much money for?

500
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:33,820
I was going to buy my mom’s piano back.

501
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:34,740
Although

502
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,770
I don’t need to worry about that now,

503
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,760
my late dad

504
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,170
left me with lots of debts.

505
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,710
I have to make money.

506
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,870
I even think it’s wasting time to sleep.

507
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,960
Is the mom you mentioned Mama Jinzhi?

508
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:49,460
No.

509
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,340
I have two moms.

510
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:53,330
Mama Jinzhi is one of them.

511
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:56,550
My biological mom taught piano.

512
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,420
But she passed away.

513
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,440
My dad owed a lot of money for her disease.

514
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,840
Later he took me to Guanmei Fishing Village.

515
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:13,090
After we came to the village,

516
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,090
we met Mama Jinzhi.

517
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,610
Shortly after they got married,

518
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,430
my dad passed away.

519
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,630
So Mama Jinzhi

520
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:24,280
raised me and Shengzhe.

521
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,460
Moreover,

522
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:28,530
Mama Jinzhi not only doesn’t abandon me,

523
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:30,320
but also undertakes my dad’s debts.

524
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,100
You must think she’s stingy and snobbish.

525
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,900
Actually, she’s a really good mom.

526
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,480
I can tell

527
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,000
you’re all kind-hearted people.

528
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,220
Why don’t you work each day?

529
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,300
I…

530
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:58,880
Travelling is kind of my work.

531
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:01,390
I envy you so much.

532
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,940
If I’m rich,

533
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,440
I’m going to travel around, too.

534
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,990
Don’t envy me.

535
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,450
In fact, travelling

536
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:11,230
is a process in which you discover yourself.

537
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,020
The more you see,

538
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,740
the more you find about yourself.

539
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,390
So,

540
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,040
that’s the reason you want
to go to Dolphin Island?

541
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,490
So I must go to Dolphin Island.

542
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:24,750
OK.

543
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:25,840
I’ll take you there.

544
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,380
Aren’t you afraid of submerged rocks?

545
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,760
I’m afraid of nothing.

546
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:33,160
I’m as bold as a lion since little,

547
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:33,750
OK?

548
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:47,250
There!

549
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:48,610
Have a look.

550
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:49,120
How is it?

551
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,340
Is it too pinky

552
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,200
and dreamy?

553
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,750
But Yunyi likes it.

554
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:58,950
Do you remember when she was little,

555
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:00,320
all her things were pink?

556
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,650
She’s still a young girl with pink dreams.

557
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:05,120
But she never dressed in pink when she was little.

558
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,120
In my memory,

559
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:09,800
her clothes were all simple in good taste.

560
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,460
That’s because of you.

561
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,300
You change her preference.

562
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,590
What flower do we use tomorrow?

563
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,290
White rose, of course.

564
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,020
Why is it not lily of the valley?

565
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,970
White rose is too plain.

566
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:38,760
Yunyi likes it.

567
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,780
I find something.

568
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,400
I think you know Yunyi better.

569
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:53,640
You know what she likes,

570
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:55,070
what she likes to do

571
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,280
and what she wants,

572
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:57,900
which I know nothing.

573
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,760
If it’s till now that you find it,

574
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:03,260
it proves that we weren’t close in childhood.

575
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:08,800
Ziqian,

576
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:10,740
why do you score 90%

577
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,200
in almost everything?

578
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:14,550
You’re serious.

579
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:16,670
You could make it to 100%.

580
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,910
I don’t want to be someone like you.

581
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:21,120
How horrible it’d be to have two Shan Junhao?

582
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,380
But the nature of competition

583
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,380
requires two persons or above.

584
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,590
I don’t want to compete.

585
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:32,990
I’m a social man.

586
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:34,840
You’re a solitary man.

587
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,700
But now the solitary man is getting married.

588
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:43,100
And the social man is still single.

589
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,870
Then don’t get married if you don’t want to.

590
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,780
Yunyi has so many wooers, anyway.

591
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,080
Don’t worry.

592
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,430
I won’t give others any chance.

593
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,240
Junhao.

594
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:01,750
Yunyi.

595
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:10,990
Junhao,

596
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,220
let’s rehearse on the stage.

597
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:14,610
OK.

598
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:17,860
Let’s go.

599
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:37,180
Ziqian,

600
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,770
your parents passed away.

601
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:40,680
But remember,

602
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:43,560
my family is your family.

603
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:46,910
Come on.

604
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:48,120
Come to uncle.

605
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,630
Uncle Shan.

606
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,580
Sweet girl,

607
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:03,130
is everything alright?

608
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:04,920
Sweet girl?

609
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:06,830
Sweet girl?

610
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,400
Sweet girl?

611
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:13,480
Uncle Shan, she’s so poor.

612
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,090
Can I take her home?

613
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,320
OK.

614
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:45,860
Where am I?

615
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,950
This is my home.

616
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,760
Thank you for taking me to your home.

617
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,590
But I have to go back and wait for Mom.

618
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:53,890
If Mom comes back and couldn’t find me,

619
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:55,100
she’ll be worried.

620
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,280
It’s OK.

621
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,680
You can wait for your mom here.

622
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,380
Your mom will come and look for you.

623
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,800
Are you hungry?

624
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:04,680
Yes.

625
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,940
What do you want to eat?

626
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,700
We have everything in my home.

627
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,720
I want chocolate.

628
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,440
OK.

629
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:13,920
Come. Let’s have some chocolate.

630
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,600
Come on.

Junhao,

633
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:52,760
I asked Mrs. Lin to cook
Date and White Fungus Soup.

634
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:00,400
We need to get up early tomorrow.

635
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:01,530
Go to bed early.

636
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:09,880
Why are you so interested
in Flying Blade all of a sudden?

637
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,620
He’s my favorite traveler blogger.

638
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,470
Is he?

639
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,780
I never heard of it from you.

640
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:21,060
Each time before I travel abroad,

641
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,400
I refer to his advice.

642
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,470
He’s been to over 70 countries.

643
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,230
And he has unique insights to each.

644
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:28,490
I admire him.

645

Yes, yes. Look,

um, I want to borrow some money.

You call him.

Really?

739
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,710
He didn’t answer.

740
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:50,990
Call again.

741
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:55,530
Junhao has never been late since little.

742
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:56,780

Hello, Rayanna.

747
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,580
Is Mr. Shan with you?

748
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,890
Junhao didn’t answer the phone

749
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,490
nor reply the texts.

750
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:25,810
OK, got it. Thanks.

751
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,040
I contacted the ring designer.

Mr. Shan left with the ring for a while.

754
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:34,110

755
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:37,650
He’s never been out of touch for no reason.

756
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,080
Dawei,

757
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:41,420
go check the venue.

758
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:42,390
OK.

759
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:47,200
Where has this kid been?

760
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,710
I’ll call others.

761
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:50,190
Gosh!

762
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:52,060
Why hasn’t it started yet?

763
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,520
What’s going on?

764
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,630
They have no sense of punctuality.

765
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,350
What time is it now?

766
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,050
OK, I see.

767
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:08,890
Keep me informed.

768
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:11,560
What do they say?

769
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:14,830
I called all Junhao’s friends.

770
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:16,140
None of them met him.

771
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:21,220
Where has he been? Gosh!

772
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:25,510
The guests

773
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:27,550
have started to complain.

774
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,730
We can’t wait any longer.

775
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,930
Call off the ceremony immediately,

776
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:46,540
in case of unnecessary presumptions.

777
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,400
Ziqian.

778
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:53,240
- What’s going on? - No idea.

779
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,750
It’s behind schedule.

780
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:58,130
Explain to us, at least.

781
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,990
It’s a waste of our time.

782
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:03,650
Director Xu, Director Xu.

783
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:06,640
No, no, no.

784
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:08,910
Dear guests,

785
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:10,640
we’re so sorry.

786
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:14,200
The chairman doesn’t feel well

787
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:15,160
and is sent to the hospital.

788
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,420
The engagement ceremony today

789
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:20,170
has to be called off.

790
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:21,490
Please forgive us.

791
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:25,300
What’s wrong with the chairman?

792
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,020
Which hospital? I want to see him.

793
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:29,670
As for the details,

794
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,620
we don’t know until we have the diagnosis report.

795
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:33,260
You won’t be of any help there.

796
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:39,510
I’ll keep you informed as soon as I have news.

797
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,240
I’m deeply sorry

798
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:43,320
about what happened today.

799
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:44,960
