11
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,830
Tonghao is kind

12
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,270
and smart.

13
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,830
He loves helping others.

14
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,190
At first, he helped me deliver goods,

15
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,120
and then he did all the heavy labor.

16
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,360
Later,

17
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,870
he assisted us in managing the inn.

18
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,000
He was meticulous about details,

19
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:08,800
such as the napkin folding,

20
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,320
tableware arrangement

21
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,160
and floor cleaning.

22
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,910
Other than that,

23
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,160
he’s friendly to everyone.

24
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,720
We all like him.

25
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,750
Tonghao said

26
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,440
this is his home

27
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,630
and the place he desires to protect.

28
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,080
He’s the most adorable person

29
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,880
I’ve ever seen.

30
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,030
This is the first time you brought him up

31
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,800
and probably the last time.

32
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,750
Can you give me a minute?

33
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:04,880
No.

34
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:06,910
Ten seconds are enough.

35
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,000
Just pretend you’re Tonghao.

36
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,470
Why?

37
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,960
Because I miss him a lot.

38
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,520
I didn’t even get to

39
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,080
say goodbye to him properly.

40
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,670
I’m not Tonghao.

41
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,200
Shan Junhao,

42
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,350
you should leave.

43
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,320
Yunyi.

44
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:41,720
Ziqian.

45
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,600
Don’t say anything.

46
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:44,670
Yunyi.

47
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:47,350
Are you OK?

48
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,040
Are you not feeling well?

49
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,790
I’m fine, Mom.

50
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:03,440
You look spiritless since you came back.

51
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,950
What happened?

52
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:08,160
You can tell me.

53
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:13,040
Mom, you’re still up?

54
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,230
Why are you dressed up like this?

55
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,760
Why did you get that outfit?

56
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,000
And your hair.

57
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,830
What happened?

58
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,160
I got wet by accident.

59
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,160
There were no other clothes available

60
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,510
but only these.

61
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,440
Junhao,

62
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,000
is your work all done?

63
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:40,230
Yes.

64
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,110
Junhao,

65
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,320
you’re still lying to me!

66
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,520
Your lie pains me more

67
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,230
than seeing you and Ye Qianyu hug.

68
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:50,960
What?

69
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,000
You went to see that woman?

70
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,150
Yunyi,

71
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,670
you mistook it.

72
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,200
It’s not what you think.

73
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,110
Nothing is going on between us.

74
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:10,840
I saw it myself. Don’t deny it!

75
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,400
You promised to watch the meteor shower with me,

76
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,150
yet you went to see her behind my back.

77
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,670
How could you do that to me?

78
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:17,840
I told you

79
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,670
we’re clean.

80
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,150
Why didn’t you believe me?

81
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,880
She forced me

82
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,400
to be Tonghao for ten seconds.

83
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:29,470
Know the look in your eyes when she hugged you?

84
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,470
Your eyes

85
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,790
already gave you away.

86
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,470
Is what she said

87
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,520
all true?

88
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,350
Do not go see her again!

89
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:21,080
Tonghao is kind and smart.

90
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,590
He’s the most adorable person

91
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:24,880
I’ve ever seen.

92
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,590
This is the first time you brought him up

93
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,400
and probably the last time.

94
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,110
Can you give me a minute?

95
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,500
No.

96
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,280
Ten seconds are enough.

97
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,280
Just pretend you’re Tonghao.

98
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,080
Hi, Yunyi.

99
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:01,590
Dawei.

100
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,200
I’ll drive to work myself.

101
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,860
Mr. Shan.

102
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,760
Yunyi said she’ll drive herself today.

103
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,280
Let’s go.

104
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:57,790
Junhao,

105
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,790
why didn’t Yunyi come with you?

106
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,440
Why are you here so early?

107
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,400
I have an appointment

108
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,670
with someone.

109
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,380
Junhao,

110
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,320
if you don’t cherish Yunyi,

111
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:23,790
someone else will.

112
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:26,880
But you can’t hurt her.

113
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,320
Yunyi is my fiancée.

114
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,080
Why would I hurt her?

115
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,110
I thought you forgot who she is.

116
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,000
Since we were little,

117
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,080
have you ever truly cared for anyone

118
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,000
even for a minute?

119
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:54,640
Let’s go.

120
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,550
Yes.

121
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,280
Come in.

122
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,960
Here are the files you asked for, Mr. Shan.

123
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,400
I’ll put them on your table.

124
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:18,930
If there’s nothing else,

125
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:19,830
I’ll be out.

126
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:26,280
You really think I don’t care

127
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,800
about anyone around me?

128
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,150
Uh, Mr. Shan,

129
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,400
are you asking me?

130
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,640
Who else is here?

131
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,470
Is there anyone else in this room?

132
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:40,320
Mr. Shan,

133
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,030
you never need others’ advice,

134
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,440
so I’m not used to this.

135
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,320
What should I do

136
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,320
to cheer a girl up?

137
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:57,760
Never mind. You have no girlfriend.

138
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,200
Asking you is of no use.

139
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,000
Well,

140
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,710
it’s true that I’m single,

141
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,790
but I know a thing or two

142
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,520
about dating.

143
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,670
Mr. Shan,

144
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:13,910
when you’re with Miss Fan, you’re a bit...

145
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,730
A bit what?

146
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:20,940
Mr. Shan,

147
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:22,790
with all due respect,

148
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:25,590
you’re a typical straight man.

149
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,910
Girls

150
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:29,550
want you to spend more time with them,

151
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,880
drive them everywhere,

152
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,000
and share joys and sorrows with them.

153
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,910
Make sure they can reach you 24/7.

154
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,440
Just like how you treat me?

155
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:37,880
No, Mr. Shan,

156
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,910
I don’t like you.

157
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,350
No, uh, I don’t like men.

158
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,840
No, I mean...

159
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,350
My point is

160
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,200
girls

161
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,080
need care and romance.

162
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,200
For example,

163
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:57,110
you can say more sweet words,

164
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,030
and give them small surprises.

165
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,960
If you two argue,

166
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,320
no matter who’s at fault,

167
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,320
you should apologize immediately.

168
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,230
Kneel, if necessary.

169
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,470
Don’t just stand there.

170
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,080
Anyway,

171
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:11,880
remember one thing,

172
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:12,760
spoil them.

173
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:23,880
How should I make small surprises?

174
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:26,460
Sir,

175
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,880
you’re asking the right person.

176
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,550
There are many ways.

177
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:33,550
For instance,

178
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:37,080
prepare a special gift in secret

179
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:40,880
and ask her out to a romantic place,

180
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,710
then surprise her.

181
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,470
Will it work?

182
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:48,080
Of course.

183
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,110
It’ll work like a charm.

184
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,840
Mr. Shan, if that’s all,

185
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,840
I’ll go back to work.

186
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,310
Princess Snow

187
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,160
is really something.

188
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,280
Her previous videos

189
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,560
only received millions of hits.

190
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,680
But since she posted that photo with Shan Junhao,

191
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,040
her fan base and popularity

192
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,640
have grown dramatically.

193
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,040
She’s so good at promoting herself.

194
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,070
But then again,

195
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,310
Shan Junhao made a huge sacrifice

196
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,760
for our inn.

197
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:35,640
He never took photos with others,

198
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,070
but this time,

199
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:39,000
he made an exception for us

200
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,920
and agreed to let Princess Snow post it online.

201
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:43,280
I could also do that

202
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,470
for Guanmei.

203
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:45,880
Oh, save it!

204
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,880
If you change your WeChat photo,

205
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,590
maybe more girls will friend you.

206
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:51,710
I don’t want other girls.

207
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,520
Liyin,

208
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,040
can you get me out

209
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,110
from the blocked list?

210
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,560
I’ve been massaging your shoulders for so long.

211
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:02,800
If you continue to massage my arms,

212
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,640
I’ll grant your request.

213
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:06,100
Deal.

214
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,430
This time, not only didn’t Shan Junhao

215
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:12,520
destroy our inn,

216
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,880
but he helped us instead.

217
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,470
Sometimes, I feel as if

218
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,520
Tonghao were back.

219
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,830
Perhaps

220
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:23,800
Tonghao is inside his heart.

221
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,160
Thanks to him,

222
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:29,470
all the other media

223
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,680
won’t publish Princess Snow’s allergy incident.

224
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,280
But,

225
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,070
when we host events like this in the future,

226
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,470
we should be more careful.

227
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,520
Yes.

228
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,880
Senwell has recognized Guanmei Inn

229
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,350
as part of its group.

230
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,710
It’s a good thing

231
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,310
and it also means

232
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:47,800
Guanmei Inn is temporarily free from the risk

233
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,430
of being leveled.

234
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:53,920
I guess that’s our biggest gain

235
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,800
from this event.

236
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,470
Alright.

237
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,000
That’s all for the summary.

238
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,590
It’s time to relax.

239
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:03,830
Relax?

240
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:11,470
It’s weird.

241
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,160
How come Fengqiao and Sheng

242
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,920
didn’t come downstairs?

243
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,800
I’m going to the Money Bag Grocery.

244
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,070
You two take your time.

245
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,040
How should we relax?

246
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:42,880
What are you doing here?

247
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:44,710
To buy toothpaste.

248
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,350
Doesn’t the inn have a toothpaste supplier?

249
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,310
Why did you come here to buy it?

250
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:55,110
Speak!

251
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,640
Did you do something dirty

252
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,400
while I was away?

253
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,590
Of course not.

254
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:04,760
I didn’t do anything.

255
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:15,780
Uh...

256
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,110
Where is this bouquet from?

257
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,190
Butterball,

258
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:21,000
did you see anyone here?

259
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,760
No.

260
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,710
Not even a fly.

261
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:25,800
Who put it here?

262
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,430
Did Taichu buy it for Qianyu?

263
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:29,860
Don’t think so.

264
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,190
They went out together.

265
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:36,230
Could it be a gift for me from Li Donglu?

266
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,110
Behave yourself and act your age!

267
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,000
Would Li Donglu

268
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,830
be so generous?

269
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,160
At least, he’s better than you.

270
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,800
I’m old and attractive.

271
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,040
It’s none of your business.

272
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,880
You want to be attractive,

273
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,760
but you can’t.

274
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:54,540
Nobody would like you

275
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,310
other than the blind or the stupid.

276
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,420
I can’t believe

277
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,180
there are people like you, Chen Jinzhi.

278
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,070
Did you grow up on poison?

279
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:06,000
Yeah. I took it three times a day.

280
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,280
Never missed it once!

281
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,880
If you don’t want to be poisoned,

282
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,800
then get the hell out!

283
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,460
Fine.

284
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,040
Mark your words.

285
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,400
Wait!

286
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,830
Did you buy the flowers for me?

287
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:29,950
I...

288
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,950
Why would I do that?

289
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,000
I’m not crazy.

290
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:39,540
I’m leaving.

291
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,560
Dawei.

292
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,400
Where are we going?

293
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,920
This isn’t the way home.

294
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,040
Relax, Yunyi.

295
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:17,920
You’ll find out after you arrive.

296
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,230
Please enjoy.

297
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:31,800
Thanks.

298
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,000
Food here must be pricey, right?

299
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,190
It’ll probably cost half a month’s expenses.

300
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:52,160
We should leave.

301
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,520
It’s OK.

302
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,590
We worked so hard.

303
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:55,880
It’s time to treat ourselves.

304
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,560
Here.

305
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,430
To the narrow success of Guanmei Inn!

306
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,310
Cheers!

307
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:01,700
Thanks.

308
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,470
This is your table, sir.

309
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:38,400
Excuse me,

310
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,560
are there other tables available?

311
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,460
I’m sorry, Mr. Shan.

312
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,180
We’re fully booked. All tables are occupied.

313
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:46,880
Thanks.

314
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:47,800
You’re welcome.

315
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,280
Qianyu,

316
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:00,640
how about we go to another restaurant?

317
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,640
No need. This place is nice.

318
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:04,640
Qianyu,

319
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:08,070
the best way to let go of a person

320
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,800
is to wait or find a new one.

321
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,880
I don’t mind being used.

322
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,400
Taichu.

323
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:17,760
Why do you...

324
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,950
Because I love you.

325
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,830
I’m not ready yet.

326
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,070
I understand. I can wait.

327
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,590
It’s work time.

328
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:59,760
Why did you take me here?

329
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,230
Let’s have a date.

330
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,230
You didn’t know they’d be here?

331
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:12,640
Yunyi,

332
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:14,590
this is our date.

333
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,310
It has nothing to do with her.

334
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,560
Don’t think too much.

335
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,280
Please enjoy.

336
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:22,950
Thanks.

337
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,710
What’s this?

338
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,230
Open it.

339
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,230
This necklace is stunning!

340
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:46,430
You like it?

341
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:47,850
Yunyi,

342
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,430
from now on, I’ll always be with you.

343
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,780
Junhao,

344
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:59,310
why did you say that all of a sudden?

345
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,760
I didn’t do well enough.

346
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,590
I failed to make you happy

347
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:05,230
and I ignored your feelings.

348
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,430
From now on,

349
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:07,470
I...

350
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,830
Junhao, are you OK?

351
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:17,230
You never apologized to me before

352
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,760
or cheered me up with romantic surprises.

353
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,560
I’m really sorry

354
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,680
about last night.

355
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:27,760
I’m not sure if I’m doing the right thing

356
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:30,880
or if you like it,

357
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,070
but I simply hope

358
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:36,160
you’ll stop being mad at me.

359
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,040
All these years,

360
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,400
I’ve seldom spent time with you

361
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,280
or taken care of you,

362
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,190
but I’ll do my best to make it up to you.

363
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,070
Junhao, you’ve changed.

364
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,680
You mean you don’t like it?

365
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:59,310
No. I love it.

366
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:03,070
I just find it hard to believe you’d do it for me.

367
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:07,560
Do you mean

368
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:09,430
you’ve forgiven me?

369
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,430
We’ll have to wait and see.

370
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,760
Let me put it on you.

371
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,400
Qianyu.

372
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:04,680
Qianyu.

373
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:07,880
What are you looking at?

374
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,070
Is it that good?

375
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,110
Even better than me?

376
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:11,350
Do you like it?

377
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:13,040
I do.

378
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,020
Yunyi.

379
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,280
Thanks.

380
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,680
Do you like the food?

381
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:17,100
It’s good.

382
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:30,110
Qianyu,

383
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:31,640
let me tell you a story.

384
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,590
During one of my trips,

385
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,640
I was on the plane. It was noisy.

386
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,110
The stewardess gave me a gum

387
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,470
and it worked.

388
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,640
But then I couldn’t get it out

389
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,160
from my ear.

390
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:48,710
You put it in your ear?

391
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:49,430
Yeah.

392
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,400
Then the stewardess told me

393
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,350
it was for me to chew

394
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:01,520
not to plug my ear.

395
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,680
You’re silly.

396
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,640
That’s funny.

397
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,560
Yunyi.

398
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,950
I could laugh at that for a year.

399
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:47,820
= Money Bag Grocery =

400
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:50,830
They’re back.

401
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,160
Thanks, Taichu. I had a good day.

402
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,190
You’re welcome.

403
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,430
I’m leaving.

404
00:30:58,430 --> 00:30:59,100
Bye.

405
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,640
Qianyu.

406
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:21,800
I can’t wait

407
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,430
to have you as my girlfriend,

408
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:25,760
but

409
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:28,880
I’ll never force you to do anything.

410
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,400
Chen,

411
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,310
since when has touching shoulders

412
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,230
also become PG-13?

413
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,830
Nothing is happening for now,

414
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,400
but what will happen next

415
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:42,560
is probably for adults only.

416
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:46,680
I’ll wait for you.

417
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,080
Go back.

418
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:53,590
Good night.

419
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,230
That’s it?

420
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,710
Yeah.

421
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:11,560
Mr. Shan.

422
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,830
What’s wrong?

423
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,000
Well...

424
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:23,000
Shouldn’t you give me a raise?

425
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,310
What is he talking about?

426
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:28,350
Ignore him.

427
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:30,880
Mr. Shan.

428
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:44,520
Ye Qianyu,

429
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,710
Taichu almost poured his heart out.

430
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,040
How could you not be moved?

431
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,230
No, no, no.

432
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,190
Ye Qianyu is smart

433
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:57,710
by playing hard to get.

434
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:00,310
You know Xiaoxuan wants to play with me,

435
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:02,350
but she acts like she doesn’t like me.

436
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:05,710
What are you talking about?

437
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:09,160
I wish I could knock some sense into you.

438
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,400
If you let that roasted duck fly away,

439
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,800
I’ll grill you.

440
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:14,710
Chen,

441
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:16,950
that’s a terrible metaphor.

442
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:19,070
How could Taichu be a duck,

443
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,880
and a roasted one?

444
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:23,880
He’s a gold mine, OK?

445
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,040
Stay out of the adults’ conversation.

446
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,190
Mom.

447
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:32,070
I know Taichu treats me well,

448
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,230
but...

449
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,560
The best way to let go of a person

450
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,800
is to wait or find a new one.

451
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,830
I strongly suggest you choose the latter.

452
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,000
How come you said the same thing?

453
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Qianyu.

454
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,760
You can’t drown yourself in the past

455
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,950
when Tonghao was still here.

456
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,400
Ye Qianyu,

457
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,400
for the sake of our family,

458
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,800
you should be with Taichu.

459
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:14,280
You’d better

460
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,840
think carefully.

461
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,360
Your joke isn’t funny at all

462
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,910
but the way you told it is.

463
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,120
Tell me one more.

464
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,360
- Morning, boss. - Morning, boss.

465
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,360
My joke isn’t funny?

466
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,520
Fine, I’ll stop.

467
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,300
It is. Tell me more.

468
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,520
Please. Tell me more.

469
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,190
Pretty please.

470
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:54,000
No.

471
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,000
Just one more.

472
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,430
Come on, or I’ll be mad.

473
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,560
Morning, Mr. Shan.

474
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:06,020
Ziqian.

475
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:06,760
Hi, Ziqian.

476
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:17,260
= Representative of Party A Shan Junhao =

477
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,660
= Representative of Party B Wang Yongliang =

478
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,120
Thank you for trusting Senwell.

479
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,040
I’m glad we can reach a final agreement.

480
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,560
Development of Guanmei Fishing Village

481
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,000
combines the protection

482
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,630
of its original flavor and historical value

483
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,470
and the installation of convenient facilities

484
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:57,430
and modern culture,

485
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:59,520
producing a unique resort

486
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,670
and win-win cooperation.

487
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:03,390
We have complete faith in Senwell.

488
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:04,760
Next,

489
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,910
Taichu will be working with Senwell

490
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:08,120
as our executive consultant

491
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,910
to ensure the smooth running of the project.

492
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,560
My pleasure.

493
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,710
Please arrange

494
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:16,360
an office for me, Mr. Shan.

495
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:17,870
No problem.

496
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:19,470
We’ll meet

497
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:20,800
all your demands.

498
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:21,710
Thanks.

499
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,430
Hope we can work well together.

500
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:43,000
Qianyu.

501
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,560
What are you doing?

502
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:46,520
I’m working.

503
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,670
Let me help you.

504
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:54,280
Qianyu.

505
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,190
I have good news and bad news.

506
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:57,390
Which one do you want to hear first?

507
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:58,190
Good news first.

508
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:01,150
The good news is

509
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:04,080
GQ has finally signed the contract with Senwell

510
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:07,320
on the condition of preserving

511
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,190
all Guanmei’s traditions during the development.

512
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:13,230
Do you mean…

513
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:15,080
I mean

514
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,190
GQ gave credit to my feasibility report.

515
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:18,670
I’ve been appointed as general consultant

516
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,150
to oversee Senwell’s development project.

517
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:22,560
So, the entire village

518
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,630
the inn included,

519
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:24,910
will become better.

520
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,360
Really?

521
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,150
Of course.

522
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,150
I won’t allow them

523
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:30,120
to do any damage to the village.

524
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:32,320
What’s the bad news?

525
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,840
The bad news is

526
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,080
I have to leave.

527
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:45,470
Where are you going?

528
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,120
The project will be launched soon,

529
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,630
so I have to work with others

530
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:50,670
in Senwell.

531
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:52,800
I’ll come here whenever I’m free,

532
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,230
but I’m afraid I’ll spend most of the time

533
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:55,470
in Senwell.

534
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,150
Oh.

535
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,280
Qianyu.

536
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,190
Why don’t you go with me?

537
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,100
Go... Go with you?

538
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:08,840
Where to?

539
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,120
During this Tourism and Culture Festival,

540
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,520
I saw a different Ye Qianyu.

541
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,760
She’s smart, capable

542
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,670
and extremely flexible.

543
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:20,150
She’s also an excellent organizer.

544
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,470
A person like her

545
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:25,080
can be a wonderful hotel manager.

546
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,800
Don’t flatter me.

547
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,150
I get cocky easily.

548
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,000
Mr. Tang is old

549
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,040
and rigid.

550
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,280
Shengzhe is too young.

551
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:36,360
That makes you

552
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,000
the best fit to take over Guanmei Inn.

553
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,670
You should improve yourself quickly

554
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:41,630
to take your family business to the next level.

555
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,760
Go to Senwell with me.

556
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,760
It’s the best platform for you to grow.

557
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:49,850
Me going to Senwell?

558
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,950
If you’re worried about Shan Junhao,

559
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:00,040
don’t be.

560
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,080
Love is only part of your life.

561
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,280
It’s not everything.

562
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:05,470
We can’t stop moving forward

563
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:07,080
just because of a failed relationship.

564
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:09,280
Only by facing the past honestly

565
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,080
can we sense the beauty of the future.

566
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:20,390
Don’t you want to

567
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:21,670
be part of the development project?

568
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:37,520
Got any dirty laundry?

569
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,360
Qianyu.

570
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,470
Qianyu?

571
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:45,040
Anything bothering you?

572
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:46,560
What’s on your mind?

573
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:52,390
Taichu invited me to work in Senwell

574
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,520
as his assistant.

575
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,190
I’m not sure if I should go.

576
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:00,040
That’s a great opportunity.

577
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,910
You can’t miss it.

578
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,320
But I’ve never worked in a company before

579
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,390
and I’m inexperienced.

580
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,910
I’m scared.

581
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,320
You’re scared?

582
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:22,230
Qianyu.

583
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,950
You know why

584
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:27,120
I always tell you to marry a rich man?

585
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:32,190
To pay off Dad’s debt.

586
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,190
Because... I don’t want you to follow in my steps.

587
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:43,040
I can’t do anything else

588
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,430
other than running a grocery store.

589
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,600
That’s why my life is hard.

590
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,760
But you’re different.

591
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,360
You’re smart and capable.

592
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,600
You belong

593
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,080
to a bigger world.

594
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,190
If you don’t fly,

595
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:02,280
how do you know where your limit is?

596
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,230
Don’t be afraid.

597
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,080
Just go for it.

598
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:08,760
If one day, you fall by accident,

599
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,600
I’ll be down there to catch you.

600
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:16,120
Thanks, Mom.

601
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,840
Be brave.

602
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,470
Seize every chance coming your way.

603
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,120
Every bit of it

604
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:24,950
can make a difference.

605
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:26,320
Understand?

606
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:27,520
Yes.

607
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,840
I’m sure you can do it.

608
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,320
I can do it.

609
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:32,860
You can do it.

610
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:33,500
I can do it.

611
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:36,710
I can do it.

612
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:37,870
Think it over.

613
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:38,390
I believe

614
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:39,800
you’ll make the right choice.

615
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:47,560
I’ll take it to wash.

616
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:50,940
I can do it.

617
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,230
Up to now, you still don’t trust me, do you?

618
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:04,390
It’s your father’s talking.

619
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:05,870
Didn’t you hear that?

620
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,280
If all these couldn’t convince you…

621
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,630
Xu Ziqian,

622
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,950
you’re fooling yourself.

623
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:23,430
Ziqian, your father spent all of his life on this.

624
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:25,600
It should have been yours.

625
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:27,800
What do you have now?

626
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:30,630
You’re serving the Shans,

627
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:32,760
in the name of a little director.

628
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,710
I think it’s unfair.

629
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,190
Tell me,

630
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:42,950
