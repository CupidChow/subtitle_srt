1
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:35,744
It can't be.

2
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:05,356
It's been a really long time.

3
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:10,779
You...

4
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:14,908
You were alive?

5
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:22,207
I keep achieving that difficult mission.

6
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,637
You were alive.

7
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,266
You were alive.

8
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:43,103
I'm sorry.

9
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:47,816
I'm sorry.

10
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:06,876
Jerk.

11
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:10,130
Jerk. Just because you're alive
doesn't mean it's all okay.

12
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:11,673
Jerk.

13
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,143
I missed you.

14
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:26,354
There wasn't a single moment
when I forgot you.

15
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:28,523
I don't need you or anyone else.

16
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:30,692
I'm going to live alone.

17
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,695
I'm going to be a monk.

18
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:44,038
I love you.

19
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,916
I said, I love you.

20
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,808
Wow, it's amazing.

21
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:04,767
EPISODE 16

22
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,312
It doesn't usually snow in Uruk.

23
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,569
If what I heard during my
deployment training was correct,

24
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:16,946
it's been 100 years
since it last snowed here.

25
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,406
Wow.

26
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,376
That day, First Lieutenant Yoon said,

27
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:34,464
"It's snowing for the first time
in 100 years."

28
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,183
And...

29
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:50,772
she said, "He appeared through that snow."

30
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:47,120
My answer... is very late.

31
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,420
I won't break up with you.

32
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:02,051
Even if I die,
I'll never break up with you.

33
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:56,522
As I always emphasize,
a soldier who cannot protect himself,

34
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:59,192
cannot protect his nation,
nor the beautiful women.

35
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:03,112
You are to remember just one thing
during the operation. What is it?

36
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,406
Don't get hurt!

37
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,450
Good.

38
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:12,622
You have five minutes to gather at the
military training ground with snow tools.

39
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:14,874
-Go.
-Go!

40
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:53,454
Hey, can the deputy platoon leader
be crying in front of his platoon?

41
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,378
How did your GED test go?

42
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:02,922
I passed.

43
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,801
I'm now a high school graduate.

44
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:55,850
I won't die again.

45
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:02,899
Never again will I die, even if I die.

46
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,280
I don't believe you.

47
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,078
But please do that for sure.

48
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,916
It snowed for the first time in 100 years.

49
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,585
And you returned alive.

50
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,089
I used up all the luck of a lifetime,

51
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,927
so all I have left is you.

52
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:33,804
Okay.

53
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,974
But how did you get here?

54
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,269
What about Si-jin?

55
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,231
When we went to headquarters
to report we were alive,

56
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:44,690
I heard about you.

57
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:49,904
We left the Allied Forces Camp right away,
and I came here,

58
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,240
while the Captain went to Albania.

59
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,450
What happened to you two?

60
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:58,621
You and Si-jin...

61
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:02,208
You were soldiers killed in combat
and your bodies weren't recovered.

62
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:12,301
The militia were one step ahead
of the bomb attack.

63
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:16,514
Before the bomb attack,
we were dragged to a dugout.

64
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,309
We were locked up
in that unknown underground place,

65
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:25,398
and on approximately
the 150th or 155th day...

66
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,660
Finish both of them,
then retreat immediately. Hurry.

67
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:53,259
I will pay you back for the cookie,
even if it's in the afterlife.

68
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,096
This is the payment
for the cookie I owed you.

69
00:09:58,222 --> 00:09:59,348
I wish you luck.

70
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:02,226
I got the help of my friend

71
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,021
from that faraway place.

72
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,774
It's all set.

73
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:11,277
How did you know to break your arm
in advance?

74
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,655
I was going to break it
as soon as you got here.

75
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,449
My girlfriend's a doctor.

76
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:22,997
That doctor girlfriend put me in bed,

77
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,416
so I was hoping for a lot.

78
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,962
I've missed your jokes.

79
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,175
You've suffered a lot.

80
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:37,845
Needle. Needle.

81
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:39,430
The needle. I'm sorry.

82
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:44,435
What do you have to be sorry for?
I am the one who is sorry.

83
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:13,964
I won't do this again.

84
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,222
I'll believe you again.

85
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:28,562
I was curious earlier. What is that?

86
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,524
It is your memorial ritual food.

87
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,776
Today is the anniversary of your death.

88
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:38,030
As if I haven't done enough already--

89
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,077
By any chance...

90
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:46,956
-you're not, right?
-What?

91
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:08,436
Wow, you killed me twice.

92
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,813
Did a doctor just think I was a ghost?

93
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,440
You studied science.

94
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,608
You showed up on the anniversary
of your death.

95
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,111
Human or a ghost, eat the fruit,

96
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:18,988
since I prepared them for you.

97
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:22,116
Drink the wine too. It's not rice wine,
but it will do.

98
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:25,327
You prepared a lot, even though
you are in a far-away foreign land.

99
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:29,665
Wait a minute.

100
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,465
How come you didn't call at all, wench?
I was worried.

101
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,175
I am sorry. I was super busy.

102
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,093
-Busy my ass.
-Dr. Kang!

103
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,428
Dr. Kang!

104
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:44,138
Seriously.

105
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:46,140
Why a video call?
It's making me blush.

106
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:49,185
Hey! I can't see your face,
stand over in the light.

107
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,145
Okay.

108
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:52,813
Here?

109
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:01,113
I'm not the only one who sees him, right?

110
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,493
Yeah... I see him too.

111
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:09,497
Are you okay? Don't you see him?

112
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,998
See what?

113
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:16,545
Today is the anniversary of
Captain Yoo's death, right?

114
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:22,384
Then... that is the memorial table, and...

115
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:27,056
I's true... He came to eat the food
off of his ceremonial table.

116
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:35,439
This woman tried to kill me
three times. Do you enjoy it?

117
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:39,109
You aren't planning to do this kind of
thing after coming back alive?

118
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,820
But they're really cute, right?

119
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:44,573
They must have caught on!

120
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:49,995
Listen to me very carefully.

121
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:52,998
Please don't ask me why.

122
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:53,999
What is it?

123
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,835
Say that you love him...

124
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,462
That you miss him...

125
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,799
Express it to your heart's content...

126
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,510
so he won't linger in this world.

127
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:06,136
What?

128
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,764
I know you won't believe this,

129
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,226
but Captain Yoo is over there.

130
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:16,313
Please tell him to go to a good place.

131
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,317
I'm going to go crazy!

132
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,152
They're telling you to leave already.

133
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,988
That upsets me.

134
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:26,240
-Wow!
-Whoa!

135
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,243
Oh, my gosh.

136
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:30,828
Hello, everyone.

137
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,000
This is Captain Yoo, in the flesh.

138
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,627
You'll understand how happy I am tonight.

139
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,171
I will explain the details
when I get back.

140
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:44,216
Stop bothering me for today.
I'm hanging up now. Bye.

141
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,971
-It was Captain Yoo, right? Right?
-Right.

142
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,098
He wasn't a ghost! Am I seeing things?

143
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:04,778
Attention! To our Commander--

144
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:05,905
Thank you.

145
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:10,451
I am really grateful that you guys
came back alive.

146
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,042
Captain Yoo Si-jin.

147
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:21,170
Sergeant First Class Seo Dae-yeong.

148
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:24,965
Hey, you punks!

149
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:30,262
If I think about how much I suffered
because of you, I can't even--

150
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:37,895
I got promoted to colonel while you two
were gone, but getting promoted sooner--

151
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:39,271
Captain!

152
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:42,566
Having a nice photo and interview...
why would that be important?

153
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,610
Captain!

154
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:47,404
To me, out of everyone in the world,
you two are the most--

155
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:52,993
Ah, seriously!

156
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:57,498
You're here!

157
00:15:57,581 --> 00:16:01,126
For now, Yoo Si-jin and Seo Dae-yeong
will write reports instead of work.

158
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,712
The report should be..
as thick as the Bible.

159
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,049
-We'll be going.
-Goodbye.

160
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,385
Hey.

161
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:18,852
-What are you doing?
-I'm much more scared of A4 than of C4.

162
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:22,398
Look at this sharp corner.

163
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:25,609
If you get cut...
Wow, it would really hurt.

164
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,364
The bastard who was waterboarding us

165
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:32,574
had a Spetznaz tattoo on his wrist.

166
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,284
That was the guy who stabbed us.

167
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:38,580
But it makes us look bad
if we only write about being beat up,

168
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:42,710
let's say we counterattacked once a week
and attempted to escape once a month.

169
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:46,213
-Let's try and be honest.
-We did that twice a month.

170
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,968
They won't try to confirm it
with the militia, right?

171
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:53,846
Given our situation,
they will believe anything we write.

172
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:58,142
But the problem is, we need an appropriate
balance between reality and drama.

173
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,895
How about using Rambo as a guideline?

174
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,400
That was a different war,
we'd have to change the weapons.

175
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,902
I'd rather go with the Bourne series.

176
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,821
First Lieutenant Yoon likes Matt Damon.

177
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:13,949
Perfect. Then I will leave.

178
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,242
Where are you going?

179
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,370
Only one of us should write it, otherwise

180
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:22,166
details like, getting hit three
or five times might not line up.

181
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:23,876
Why does "one of us" mean me?

182
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,711
Isn't First Lieutenant Yoon in Uruk?

183
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:30,049
Good luck to the soldier
whose girlfriend isn't in Korea.

184
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:39,433
Do you remember dumping me here?

185
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,310
Of course.

186
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,438
I may dump you here again today.

187
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:47,649
You're kidding, right?
I've been traumatized.

188
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:48,692
I'm serious.

189
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,447
That's why I'm asking.

190
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:57,367
In the future, will you still keep doing

191
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,120
work that means you have to go to
the department store?

192
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,122
Is it because you want to be a hero?

193
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:10,047
Not one soldier wants to be called a hero
after they die.

194
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:11,590
We just...

195
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,469
protect peace in places
that should be peaceful.

196
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:18,764
So you will keep doing it
even though I object to it?

197
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:19,973
Will you object to it?

198
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:21,517
Shouldn't I?

199
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:26,772
The next time
you actually might not return.

200
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:32,694
Don't get anxious. I won't object.

201
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,072
What's the point?

202
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:39,076
Even if you're sorry,
you won't give it up.

203
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:42,830
And I'll resent you,
but end up supporting you.

204
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:45,624
If it's going to be that way,
I'd rather keep the peace too.

205
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:50,212
Of course that is
only if my support brings you peace.

206
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,467
Thank you, and I'm sorry.

207
00:18:56,301 --> 00:19:00,264
I'm sorry that all I can say
is that I'm sorry.

208
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,977
Should we go fishing tomorrow
since you didn't get dumped?

209
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:07,604
It's a form of emotional therapy.

210
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,150
I'm going to put on my charm
so don't be surprised,

211
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:14,361
and even when I act really happy,
don't feel bad.

212
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:18,323
Be grateful for meeting a girl like me.

213
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:31,879
The view is beautiful
and my heart is at peace.

214
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,798
I feel the pain in my heart healing.

215
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:40,888
It's been two hours already,
nothing's biting.

216
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:43,932
How have we not had a single bite?

217
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:49,813
Are you creating new trauma

218
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,857
to overcome the pre-existing trauma?

219
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,443
This won't work. I'm getting frustrated.

220
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:04,077
The arboretum is nearby.

221
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,831
I'm changing my treatment plan.
Let's go for a walk and get fresh air.

222
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:11,293
Do you... know how many kilometers
I march a year?

223
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,713
Oh, there's a monastery, too.
How about a monastery?

224
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:17,382
Do you know how many months

225
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,843
I was trapped with only men
with crew cuts?

226
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,053
What do you want to do?

227
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,889
Something conventional.

228
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,642
"The weather's cold
and the fish aren't biting.

229
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,019
Do you want to rest?" Stuff like that.

230
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:32,481
Something like, "Oh, no, it seems
there's only one room left."

231
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:37,903
-Don't cross the line.
-But we can still share a room together.

232
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:38,820
Of course.

233
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,365
Last time, you said you wouldn't
lie in bed with a man.

234
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:42,366
That wasn't me.

235
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:45,202
She was a year younger than me.

236
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,536
She's clueless.

237
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,372
Right?

238
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:51,333
I really didn't like that girl.

239
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:52,793
I caught one.

240
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:55,003
We should finish
the rest of our conversation.

241
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:56,964
Is it me or the fish?

242
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:03,345
How can a special forces agent not touch
a fish? You even came back from the dead!

243
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,723
I won't get hurt and I won't die,
however...

244
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,435
I really can't touch a fish.

245
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,648
You're so cute,
so I'll let it slide this time.

246
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,401
We will start cutting the carp. Scalpel.

247
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:22,114
You are such a heartless woman.

248
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,539
That hotel looks very nice.

249
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,000
The bed looks big and comfy.

250
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:37,421
You fool. The smaller the bed,
the better it is, you know that.

251
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:39,464
Which bastard was it?

252
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:42,843
What kind of bastard taught you that?

253
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,970
The one named Yoo Si-jin.

254
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,807
I endured the time while he was gone
by doing this.

255
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:54,438
"I should leave this there.
I should take this back.

256
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:57,274
Once I take this back,
I should forget everything.

257
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:59,318
I should forget and let him go."

258
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,403
I bought a plane ticket, but canceled it.

259
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,322
I reserved a hotel, but canceled it too.

260
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,449
I requested some time off,
 but I canceled it.

261
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,076
He was wrong for sure.

262
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:15,000
Do you think we could
really go back there?

263
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,418
Who are you going to go with?

264
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:17,711
With you!

265
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,047
I'm looking forward to it.

266
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:23,925
-When are we leaving?
-I am not sure. Wait and see.

267
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:28,722
You have to wait, just like I did.

268
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:34,436
If that's my punishment,
then I'm willing to take it.

269
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:40,400
As we live our lives, when I suddenly say,
"Now!" Come running with your passport.

270
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:48,408
But where's the line here?

271
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:50,702
-I need to know so I won't cross it.
-Oh?

272
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:53,413
Being near you like this is so--
I am so cold right now.

273
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:54,706
You fool.

274
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:58,543
Tow the line or quit.

275
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:00,754
That's good.

276
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:11,014
Not now.

277
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:15,977
You are such a difficult woman,
for crying out loud.

278
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:26,696
YOON MYEONG-JU

279
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,870
Are you almost done with the report?

280
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:37,082
I'm suffering from writer's block.

281
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,668
Do you even know how to turn on Word?

282
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,837
Sometimes I wonder what you take me for.

283
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,380
I see you as a man.

284
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,884
Aren't you busy?
I'm happy to hear your voice so often.

285
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:53,390
Every time I wake up, I ask Gi-beom

286
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,851
if you coming back was all a dream.

287
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:59,563
Gi-beom came to me first today,

288
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:02,941
and he told me, "Sergeant First Class Seo
coming back wasn't a dream."

289
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,944
Even though I know,
I still needed to check.

290
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,864
Only hearing your voice assures me.

291
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:11,032
You can call me anytime.

292
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,951
I'll even answer in my sleep.

293
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:16,079
But tomorrow I can't talk,
we will be escorting a VIP.

294
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:19,207
A VIP? Who is it?

295
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:26,923
Big Boss transmitting.
Has the VIP arrived?

296
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:30,135
Piccolo transmitting.
From my current location,

297
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:32,804
I have secured a view
of the vehicle in transit.

298
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:35,390
Snoopy transmitting.
The entrance is clear.

299
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:38,393
Roger that. Everyone,
head towards the meeting place.

300
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,020
I will be escorting the VIP.

301
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:43,148
Wolf here. Big Boss, you should
standby at your current location.

302
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:46,735
Snoopy and I will escort the VIP
and manage their close-range security.

303
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,862
Snoopy, open the door.

304
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:54,201
Wow, you guys are quick.

305
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:58,622
With that speed, you should do deliveries
instead of being a soldier.

306
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:07,255
Hello! One, two, three.

307
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:10,842
Happiness!
Nice to meet you, we are Red Velvet.

308
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:15,263
We salute the soldiers of
the Special Forces. Solidarity!

309
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:22,080
We love you, Kang Seul-gi!

310
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,209
Oh, my gosh.

311
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,628
-What's wrong?
-What is it?

312
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,338
My goodness.

313
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,007
Dr. Kang, you need to see this.

314
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:34,342
We love you, Kang Seul-gi!

315
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:35,927
RED VELVET TRUMPS MY GIRLFRIEND

316
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:37,971
We love you forever!

317
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:42,058
It's the 23rd, the day Captain Yoo
went on an operation, right?

318
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,768
Seems like a big "operation."

319
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:46,354
That's so true.
No better peace-keeping than this.

320
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:48,773
That's not Captain Yoo.

321
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:02,203
Hold on a sec.

322
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:06,041
-Excuse me. I'm sorry, but--
-Yes?

323
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:09,044
Can I ask for a favor?
It's not on the script, though.

324
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:10,045
Go ahead.

325
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:15,258
Would it be okay for you to ask
if I have a boyfriend on the show?

326
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:19,179
Kang Mo-yeon's Body Check, Season Two.

327
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:21,389
Today we learned about high cholesterol.

328
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:25,810
Before we go, I will be asking a question
that many have been curious about.

329
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:28,521
Dr Kang, you're not married yet, are you?

330
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,482
Do you have a boyfriend by any chance?

331
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:33,693
Asking me about that so suddenly...

332
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:36,029
In order to prevent high cholesterol,

333
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:40,575
it would be great to have a boyfriend
to work out with, but I don't have one...

334
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:41,701
because I'm so busy.

335
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:46,915
I watched the broadcast.

336
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:51,044
So, you don't have a boyfriend
since you're busy, eh?

337
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:52,587
Then what am I?

338
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:56,383
I guess I'm your best friend.
Your soldier best friend.

339
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:59,552
My boyfriend was broadcasted
acting like he didn't have a girlfriend,

340
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:01,262
so I thought we had agreed.

341
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:03,264
I also watched your broadcast.

342
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,016
You went wild over a girl group.

343
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,477
Soldier #1 and Soldier #2...

344
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:13,733
Wow. I never knew you were
such a good dancer.

345
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:17,070
This is a misunderstanding.
I think I'm a victim of evil editing.

346
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:20,115
Oh... evil editing?

347
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,574
Yes, that's right.

348
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:25,704
I was actually just cheering when the
battalion commander arrived,

349
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:28,081
but it just happened
to be edited like that.

350
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:32,419
So you whistled like crazy after seeing
the battalion commander?

351
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:35,338
Does your battalion commander
have "milky skin"?

352
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,465
The battalion commander does have
nice skin.

353
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:41,219
I am going to kill you.

354
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:43,054
You liked Red Velvet that much, huh?

355
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,974
No matter what you do, I won't let you go.

356
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:48,977
You must be kidding me.
On TV, you seemed to have let me go.

357
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,479
There are only 157 days until I return.

358
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:55,859
For the next 157 days, I'm only going to
think about how I should kill you.

359
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:57,527
Understood?

360
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,279
You're seriously being too harsh!

361
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:01,364
"It's not like I committed
a deadly crime!"

362
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:08,204
Is something that foolish men would say
to worsen the situation.

363
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:12,000
But I am going to pin my hopes on me

364
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:15,044
trying my best to explain
and your reactions.

365
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:18,465
Go ahead.
You go first and do your best.

366
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:24,846
It's all because of my carelessness.
Red Velvet isn't at fault.

367
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:26,431
I will kill you with my own hands!

368
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:29,601
Wait. Hold on.

369
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:32,979
-So you know, I'm no longer a captain.
-Then what?

370
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:36,107
Did you get dismissed?

371
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,692
No, it's not that.

372
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:41,112
I am getting promoted to a major.

373
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:42,697
Seriously?

374
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:47,035
-Why are you so happy, Dr. Kang?
-That means you'll get a raise.

375
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,078
Why would you be so happy about that?

376
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:52,540
And what's with your eyes?

377
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:55,335
Your tried your best, look at my reaction.

378
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:58,171
Look at this materialistic girl.

379
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:04,427
I report. As of March 25th 2016,
I, Captain Yoo Si-jin,

380
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:07,764
have been granted a promotion
from Captain to Major.

381
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:09,098
I report to you, sir!

382
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,393
-Solidarity.
-Solidarity.

383
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,488
The man that I am drawn to

384
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:29,744
lives as a soldier of the only
divided nation in the entire world.

385
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:36,835
He believes the beautiful, the elderly
and children should be protected.

386
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:39,379
He is an honorable major
of the Special Task Force.

387
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:45,677
And I am... still a doctor
who appears on TV broadcasts.

388
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:52,100
Of course, I'm the face that represents
Haesung Hospital.

389
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,480
I assume I need no introduction.

390
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:58,606
Yes.

391
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:01,901
From that day onward, for 157 days,

392
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:05,280
I pondered over how I should kill you.

393
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:09,075
That means I only thought of you
the entire time I was away.

394
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:10,535
And then...

395
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:14,247
I missed you so much that I could die.

396
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:25,216
But I came back alive.
Isn't that admirable?

397
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:27,886
It's nice to see you healthy.

398
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,055
Then, cheers.

399
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:40,064
I am going to meet the Commander tomorrow
while holding your hand tightly.

400
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,275
Ah.

401
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:45,403
We need to finish talking about that.

402
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:48,615
We don't need to.
I won't cast aside my uniform.

403
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:50,575
No one's taking it off, apart from you. 

404
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:55,997
-Really?
-I'll tell the Commander tomorrow too.

405
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,499
While holding your hand tightly.

406
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:01,961
Let's go early tomorrow.
As soon as the sun rises!

407
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,881
I also have a plan.

408
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:06,799
You want to go there drunk?

409
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:10,470
I've not had alcohol for six months.

410
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:12,931
Ah, okay.

411
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,184
Here, let me pour you one.

412
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:19,437
Here...

413
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,822
The two cups of tea that you promised...
I will have them today.

414
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,993
Sure. Sit. You, too.

415
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,373
Two cups of tea.

416
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:39,916
Dad, I'm pregnant.

417
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:48,174
No. That's not true.
That's absolutely not true.

418
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:49,842
Is that your plan?

419
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:54,389
Normally, they do it then confess,
but my plan is to confess before doing it.

420
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,349
When weak, a preemptive strike is best.

421
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,561
Does she have to be here?

422
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:06,567
Speak. Whether it's a preemptive strike
or a carpet bombing, I'll hear it.

423
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:10,613
You stay still.

424
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:16,703
I'll get right to the point, the promise
I made to you about handing in my uniform,

425
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:18,830
I won't be able to keep it.

426
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,416
Is that so?

427
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:26,087
Even while locked up in a basement
who knows where,

428
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,840
having my flesh torn and bones broken,

429
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,759
I didn't regret becoming a soldier.

430
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:36,431
I think the country shouldn't lose
a soldier like me.

431
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,852
When the time comes,
I want to take off my uniform honorably.

432
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,189
I will find another way
to be acknowledged by you.

433
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:49,152
Right now, whether or not
I acknowledge you is not the issue.

434
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:58,911
The country has already acknowledged
you, Sergeant First Class Seo Dae-yeong.

435
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:01,497
And as the Commander,

436
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:05,001
it is an honor to have you
as my son-in-law.

437
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:07,837
Dad.

438
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:13,468
When I sent you off,
I already gave you my permission.

439
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:15,595
I regretted doing that deeply.

440
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:21,726
Right now, I am sincerely happy
about your decision.

441
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:24,270
Thank you.

442
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:27,440
Dad!

443
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,698
I leave my daughter in your care.

444
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,077
Yes, I understand.

445
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:48,920
Sergeant First Class Seo's guardian?

446
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:52,840
Mo-yeon, the "soldier's girlfriend"?

447
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,178
It seems there always a man between us
when we meet.

448
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:01,641
Did you return safely?

449
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,477
As you can see, I am healthy.

450
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,772
What happened to your war
with Sergeant Seo?

451
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:09,190
Are you still in a truce?

452
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:12,568
Not a truce, but a cessation of war.
We got dad's approval too.

453
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,363
Really? Congratulations!

454
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,198
Let's have a drink soon.

455
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:18,950
I'm up for that whenever.

456
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:21,577
But today, I came here for another reason.

457
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,632
Sis, hello. It's me, Fatima.

458
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:36,759
I am learning Korean.

459
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:40,054
Later, I'm going to be a doctor
to help you.

460
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:45,726
Give my regards
to the other nurses and doctors.

461
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,187
I miss you and I love you.

462
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:53,985
It's worth the money.

463
00:35:57,321 --> 00:36:00,366
I'm sorry. I need to use the computer.

464
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:01,701
Okay.

465
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:04,370
SONG SANG-HYEON'S
TOUCH IT AND DIE

466
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:08,624
Nurse Ha, what is Dr. Song's password?

467
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,668
Genius Song Sang-hyeon.

468
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:18,092
Come look, First Lieutenant Yoon brought
news from Uruk.

469
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,635
-Really?
-Uruk?

470
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,645
Oh! It's Blakey.

471
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,647
He grew so much!

472
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:37,320
But still, it will take so long
until he fits in those shoes.

473
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:45,745
Huh? Blakey?

474
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:49,373
Blakey. Blakey. His name is Blakey.

475
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:50,958
And my name is...

476
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:54,879
What is this with the "baa"?

477
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,924
I couldn't hear it. Just a sec.

478
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:04,388
And my name is...

479
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:07,225
Huh?

480
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,101
My name is...

481
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:20,863
I'm going crazy.

482
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,200
What is up with the "baa"?

483
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,039
Goodbye.
The name has crumbled into pieces.

484
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:34,126
You are just Blakey. Forever.

485
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:37,171
Wait. Don't close it.

486
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:41,217
If I die here, go to the C drive
on my laptop.

487
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:45,054
In documents, there's a folder named
"brown-eared bulbul".

488
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:47,765
Please delete that folder.

489
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:48,849
What is in there?

490
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:51,394
Worse things than what you're imagining.

491
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:59,402
C... My computer.

492
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:01,862
C drive.

493
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:06,951
Alright, "brown-eared bulbul".

494
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:15,543
It was teens to thirties.

495
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:21,924
He really needs to be slapped
10 to 30 times...

496
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:25,321
Oh, I'm sorry. Are you alright?

497
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:26,447
Allow me.

498
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,367
-I'm her guardian.
-I'm sorry.

499
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:33,204
Guardian?

500
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:36,624
Never mind. It's just because I'm tired.

501
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:45,216
If you're tired, sit here and rest
instead of resting in someone else's arms.

502
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:49,387
If you saw something, you should say so.

503
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:53,015
You saw it all. Teens to thirties.
It was all in the recycle bin.

504
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:55,768
-You told me to delete it.
-I said to delete it if I die.

505
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:58,062
-Why did you delete it?
-Why were you keeping it?

506
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:02,149
To propose. That's the proposal
that I was going to do.

507
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:07,613
It's a confession that from my teens
to my 30's, it has always been you.

508
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:10,825
You-- Didn't you ever think
that was just pity?

509
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:12,952
What do you know?
I know my own feelings.

510
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:15,121
There's no need to question it.
It is love.

511
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,624
-Don't do it!
-What? Confess my love?

512
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:20,126
I'll be doing it.

513
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:22,461
What? Confessing your love?

514
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:24,547
Yes, after I've paid you back.

515
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,217
Alright then. Are you being serious?

516
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:31,345
-Hey, where are you going?
-To make some money.

517
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,848
Can't you make money faster?
Can't you borrow it?

518
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:36,308
Can't you borrow some from Kang Mo-yeon?

519
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:53,200
I don't know why I am driving this car!

520
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:56,078
Continue straight. Go, Big Boss!

521
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:57,413
I'm on it!

522
00:40:57,496 --> 00:40:59,540
No, not you.

523
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:01,792
This guy. His name is "Big Boss."

524
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:03,544
Seriously?

525
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:08,757
Do you like me that much that you'd name
your car after my call sign?

526
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,259
-Yes!
-You scared me.

527
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,220
Right over here.

528
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,972
I need to give Big Boss a wash.

529
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:17,308
Not this Big Boss.

530
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:20,144
What strange timing.

531
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:23,355
I still don't know
why I'm driving this car?

532
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:26,775
Just do it for me.
I'll end up messing him up.

533
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:29,695
My Big Boss is never getting messed up.

534
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:32,323
The timing is still odd.

535
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:51,217
Should I just give up dating?

536
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:53,344
It's so cold.

537
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:56,013
-What did you say?
-I love you.

538
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:59,350
Put the windows up.
it's windy and cold.

539
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:05,064
If you say that, I need to help you out.

540
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:06,732
I said it's cold out here.

541
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:08,484
Then, take this.

542
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,280
If I push this... 

543
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:17,284
water comes out.

544
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:18,994
Right on the money.

545
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:21,121
I'm sorry. What should I do?

546
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:23,749
Now, I've ruined your clothes.

547
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:30,548
Put this on.
I can see through your clothes.

548
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:32,633
I don't like other girls looking.

549
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:36,512
I should continue with this dating thing.
It's risqué.

550
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:40,474
-Are you saying I am?
-You're most risqué when you're laughing.

551
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:42,726
Seriously.

552
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:46,897
It's cold. Give me a hug, it's so cold.

553
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,580
This is hazing.

554
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:04,873
Report me.

555
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:13,299
I'd like to eat comfortably.
I'll get indigestion like this.

556
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:16,594
Come to the infirmary if you do.
I'm just five minutes away.

557
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:21,181
That's true! Get indigestion!

558
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:27,146
No, should I just break something?

559
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:31,984
That won't do.

560
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:34,653
You won't be able to go to Canada
if something is broken.

561
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,867
Daniel and Ye-hwa are getting married.

562
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,578
Is Daniel that doctor?

563
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,708
The ceremony will take place in Vancouver.

564
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:49,835
We got an invitation.

565
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:51,170
Getting married?

566
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:54,131
Ye-hwa and Dr. Daniel?

567
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:57,009
Here's the plane ticket,
and one night in a hotel is included.

568
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:58,969
Oh, my gosh.

569
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:02,681
But that's odd,
I thought they were already married.

570
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:05,643
No. He told me they were just colleagues!

571
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:08,562
He said they were just business partners!

572
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:09,730
Really?

573
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:13,400
Ye-hwa's father was a Korean-Russian
eastern medicine doctor.

574
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:15,361
He treated anyone in need,

575
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:18,113
from Russian soldiers
to those fighting for independence.

576
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:21,867
Because of that, her father, brother,
and mother were killed by gunmen.

577
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:23,118
Killed by gunmen?

578
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:26,372
Yes. Ye-hwa was the only one
that Daniel barely managed to save.

579
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:29,458
They ran to the Canadian embassy,
but they only let Daniel in.

580
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:31,835
They said
that a Russian citizen couldn't enter.

581
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:34,672
The law wouldn't let them
accept a refugee from the country

582
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:37,633
-the embassy was in.
-That's true. So what happened?

583
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:41,220
So Daniel said, "I'll submit
our marriage registration right now.

584
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:44,890
Bring the paperwork. From now on,
she is my wife, so protect her!"

585
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:48,936
That's how he saved Ye-hwa.

586
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:50,604
You guys talked about that?

587
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:54,400
When I mentioned your will,
she said she lost her family too.

588
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:58,821
You read the will?

589
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:01,782
Why would I read that?

590
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:03,951
You guys write lyrics
and copy each other's.

591
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:05,869
-I didn't.
-Yeah, right.

592
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:09,581
"My plan was always to run away.

593
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,752
You, who are braver than anyone else,

594
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:17,047
loved me and you are more foolish
than anyone else.

595
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:19,925
For that, I am grateful, and I am sorry.

596
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:25,180
If you are reading this will,

597
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:30,144
my foolish self is hurting you
to the very end.

598
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:32,688
Don't forgive me.

599
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:37,359
And as much as I've thought about you,

600
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:39,403
I hope you'll be happy.

601
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:44,533
I love you deeply, Yoon Myeong-ju.

602
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:49,371
Whether I live or die,
that will never change."

603
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:54,626
Don't make things up.

604
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:57,212
I'm sure you didn't memorize it.

605
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:01,091
You carry it around with you?

606
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:16,023
I wrote it over a hundred times

607
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:21,653
because I I wanted to come back to you
over a hundred times.

608
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,367
Attention!

609
00:46:33,081 --> 00:46:35,542
My subordinates will close their eyes.

610
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:03,862
My subordinates
will also close their eyes.

611
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:07,825
Close your eyes.

612
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:36,436
Who will you give
your congratulatory gift to?

613
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:40,107
Most people will give it to Daniel,
so I'll give it to Ye-hwa.

614
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,026
You forgot you ruined Daniel's car?

615
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:45,654
I'm already paying that back
in monthly donations.

616
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:50,492
You don't know how great that is,
since you don't know a charity works.

617
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:53,495
Who was the person looking for
a 007 briefcase full of money?

618
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:55,789
That woman is going to get more beer.

619
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:59,293
I was curious.

620
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:03,672
The pledging picture...
why are you the representative?

621
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,173
Were you the top student?

622
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:07,718
No. I was the representative for my looks.

623
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:11,597
It wasn't alphabetical?

624
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:14,391
Since you're a Kang,
you'd be first anywhere.

625
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:16,351
-It isn't that.
-By age?

626
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:20,397
I guess I didn't tell you.

627
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,400
Tomorrow, I'm going
to my juniors' oath taking.

628
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:25,611
I was a graduate
who made the school "shine."

629
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:28,113
"Made the school shine."

630
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:29,781
You are indebted to the school?

631
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:32,951
-Aren't you going home?
-Too much traffic.

632
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:34,578
That was your excuse hours ago.

633
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:37,623
Super bad traffic right now.
It's no joke in Yeouido right now.

634
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:42,044
Hippocrates said... a bunch of things.

635
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:45,005
Some words stuck in my mind,

636
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:47,299
and some words remained in my heart.

637
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:50,052
For example, this.

638
00:48:50,385 --> 00:48:52,804
Now that I'm licensed
to engage in medicine,

639
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:56,058
I will practice my profession
with conscience and dignity.

640
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:59,519
I, as a member
of Korea's Special Task Force,

641
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:02,856
will pledge allegiance
to this country and our citizens.

642
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:08,070
Transcending race, religion, nationality,
political affiliation, and social class,

643
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:11,615
I will uphold my responsibility
to my patients.

644
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:14,201
I will stand by the constitution,
and the laws,

645
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:17,412
and pledge to carry out the duties
of a soldier, wholeheartedly.

646
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:19,247
Even though I may face danger,

647
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:21,959
I will not use knowledge
contrary to the laws of humanity.

648
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:24,294
Even though I may face danger,

649
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:28,548
I will not retreat from any disaster.

650
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:34,596
Even when facing threats,
I shall protect the peace of this country.

651
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:43,563
Today, countless Yoo Si-jins and countless
Kang Mo-yeons solemnly vowed to do that.

652
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:49,611
I hope that those solemn vows will be kept

653
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:56,118
across the whole world
that lies beneath the sun.

654
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:10,424
Now!

655
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:27,399
We've really come back here.

656
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:31,862
It's nice to be here with you...
even this time.

657
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:36,408
Because of you, I lost the chance
to come here again with another man.

658
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:38,994
Another man?

659
00:50:39,077 --> 00:50:42,414
I couldn't come here by myself
with these beautiful looks.

660
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:44,499
I can't come here alone.

661
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:47,711
You, stand right there.

662
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:50,172
But doesn't this boat
look just like an X-ray?

663
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:53,216
-You will not change the topic.
-Wait a minute! Look at me.

664
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:54,843
That's perfect.

665
00:50:58,013 --> 00:51:01,391
Because the only picture I have of you
is that X-ray.

666
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:04,227
And I've seen that many times.

667
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:06,396
Emotional appeals won't work.

668
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,024
At the beach, it's always,
"Catch me if you can." Right?

669
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:11,026
Catch me if you can!

670
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:12,903
You are dead if I catch you.

671
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:22,996
When are we leaving?

672
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:26,416
When that boat turns into
something like that.

673
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:32,255
Really? Wow! I'm alone with a man
on a deserted island!

674
00:51:34,132 --> 00:51:35,634
It's awesome!

675
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:04,955
You're really not going to drink?

676
00:52:05,038 --> 00:52:07,457
It's really good.

677
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:09,501
I really want to drink, but...

678
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:12,420
I have to drive... the boat.

679
00:52:12,504 --> 00:52:14,214
You said that we weren't leaving.

680
00:52:14,714 --> 00:52:15,799
Who does that benefit?

681
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:25,433
Is it good?

682
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:27,477
Yes.

683
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:30,939
You look like you really want to drink.

684
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:33,775
It's not like there isn't a way, right?

685
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:36,319
I know.

686
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:41,992
Ah... That time. I was so nervous
I thought that I was going to die.

687
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:44,744
I'm so nervous right now that I could die.

688
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,248
There's alcohol at the beach.

689
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:51,168
And there's a beauty, too.

690
00:52:55,046 --> 00:52:56,756
And the stars are falling like that.

691
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:04,431
What in the world. You are kidding.

692
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:08,852
It's the first time
I've seen a shooting star.

693
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:13,148
What exactly did you do to those stars?

694
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:16,484
How are all the stars in the world
appearing here?

695
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:17,986
Aren't you making a wish?

696
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:23,366
-I already made one.
-With your mouth open?

697
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:26,703
Stop laying around.

698
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:29,956
Hurry up and try to snatch
one of those stars for me.

699
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:36,713
I already snatched one.
It's sitting right next to me.

700
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:42,802
Keep talking.

701
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:47,599
You are very sparkly.

702
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:50,560
Try one more.

703
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:59,277
My life became bright all of a sudden.

704
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:04,032
Don't mention it.

705
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:12,749
How did a woman like you come to me?

706
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:17,462
You must have saved the nation
in your past life.

707
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:20,298
No way, you must've been a
policeman in your past life.

708
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:25,303
I have progressed a lot in this life then.

709
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:28,556
No way,
we might meet again in the next life.

710
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,558
You are saving the world
in this life, too.

711
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:34,938
I have to at least save a country
to meet this woman.

712
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:37,399
Did I say that I'm going to meet you?

713
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:40,402
You aren't going to meet me
in the next life?

714
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:42,487
If I say no, you won't come find me?

715
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:47,117
You must come and find me
in the next life too.

716
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:49,494
You've promised.

717
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:00,380
What did you wish for?

718
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:04,134
You will be surprised.

719
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:05,302
What is it?

720
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:11,224
Please let this man... kiss me.

721
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:14,686
Will it come true?

722
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:19,065
There is no way it won't.

723
00:55:55,643 --> 00:55:56,519
I love you.

724
00:56:00,982 --> 00:56:02,067
Me, too.

725
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:06,196
It was a question.

726
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:13,203
I love you. That is my answer.

727
00:56:15,955 --> 00:56:17,082
Me, too.

728
00:56:44,317 --> 00:56:47,987
But in foreign countries, don't they give
presents, not money for weddings?

729
00:56:48,863 --> 00:56:52,075
Marriages and funerals,
cash is accepted in all countries.

730
00:56:56,871 --> 00:56:59,707
It's convenient for the giver
and  useful for the receiver.

731
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:04,421
Let's go.

732
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:13,179
The bride and groom are
changing and will soon be here.

733
00:57:14,347 --> 00:57:17,684
Ye-hwa did look a bit pretty
since she was all dressed up.

734
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:19,060
Her wedding dress was unique.

735
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:21,563
That view right now is also very unique.

736
00:57:23,022 --> 00:57:26,484
Gosh, can't you do something about that?

737
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:28,445
Why would you catch that?

738
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:31,448
Should I throw away the bouquet
the bride threw so passionately?

739
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:35,076
Leave him alone.

740
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:37,704
He is a man with
many memories of weddings.

741
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:39,664
His ex-girlfriend.

742
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,587
Don't you really like this kind of ending?

743
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:48,548
We overcame all of
life's misfortunes with love

744
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:51,176
and lived happily ever after
for a long, long time.

745
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:52,552
That kind of ending.

746
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:59,893
-Are they having a show?
-What? The entire city of Vancouver?

747
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:01,936
Wow, the scale is different.

748
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,563
This isn't a flashback scene.

749
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:05,440
What's with this scene all of a sudden?

750
00:58:05,523 --> 00:58:08,902
I don't think this story is about to
become a romantic comedy or a melodrama.

751
00:58:17,702 --> 00:58:20,580
I was wondering why
we had this good fortune.

752
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:22,624
I should have retired from the military.

753
00:58:22,707 --> 00:58:24,167
It's already too late.

754
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:26,794
Get up.

755
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:27,754
Okay.

756
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:31,883
Then, are we forgoing our vacation?

757
00:58:31,966 --> 00:58:34,093
It's your turn to be destroyed this time.

758
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:37,180
This feels like the introduction
to a long report.

759
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:38,973
Let's go.

760
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:31,317
