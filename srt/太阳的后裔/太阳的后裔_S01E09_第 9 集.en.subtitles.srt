1
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,367
You really did fix it.

2
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,581
I will choose the playlist then.

3
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:40,623
That's fine by me.

4
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,634
EPISODE 9

5
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:33,802
If I had known that I would die here,

6
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:36,971
I would have lived a carefree life
instead of trying for professor.

7
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:39,766
-Enjoyed life...
-Oh, my God!

8
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:47,941
Oh, no. Leaving a message like this
before dying is so uncivilized.

9
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,241
Are you coming, Yoo Si-jin?

10
00:01:57,534 --> 00:02:00,078
You are not coming.

11
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:03,123
I don't think I can last
until you get here.

12
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:05,834
Even so...

13
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:10,130
you will be the first to find me if I die.

14
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,972
If I knew I would die like this,

15
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:23,434
I would have told you my true feelings.

16
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:27,897
I got kissed from this wonderful man.

17
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:30,900
My heart flutters all the time
because of that.

18
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,381
It seems like this song is about me.

19
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,557
Seriously...

20
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,856
Oh, my God! You scared me.

21
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:13,359
How are you here? Why are you here?

22
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,361
This is a great advantage.

23
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:18,948
Are you using special forces training
that's meant to protect the country

24
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,408
for something personal?

25
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:22,702
Because someone publicly
announced it.

26
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:25,663
There needs to be doctors who broadcast!
That's what you said.

27
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,209
This is ridiculous! Why did you listen to
someone else's recording?

28
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,460
It was loud.

29
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:33,504
Just because it was loud,
doesn't mean you should have listened.

30
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:38,468
You're cute when you say what comes
to your mind. Why are you running away?

31
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:41,888
When you were about to die,
you had the heart to confess,

32
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:43,973
but now you're alive,
you've changed your mind?

33
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,476
Confess? That wasn't a confession.

34
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,728
-That was your voice.
-That wasn't me.

35
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:51,564
-This cellphone is yours.
-This isn't a phone...

36
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:54,692
What am I saying? Stop talking...

37
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,986
It's an honor that I'm in your will.

38
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,238
It's good that you know.

39
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:00,365
This isn't enough.

40
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:01,324
Over there!

41
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:04,494
I'm not fooled. Stop rejecting me.

42
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,788
Do you know how many times
you've rejected me?

43
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:10,959
I have to hear
whether or not that was a confession.

44
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:12,919
So don't run away.

45
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:17,090
I've got it.

46
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,761
I'll answer you,
so let go of me and we'll talk.

47
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,640
-Really.
-Really, really?

48
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:40,029
They say that even during war,
flowers will bloom.

49
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,740
I guess even after earthquakes,
relationships blossom.

50
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:46,577
They're all the way over here.
Still, they confess and kiss.

51
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,664
Everyone else is living to the fullest,

52
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:51,416
we should as well.

53
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:53,376
Working, but kissing in between too.

54
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,545
You're messing around a lot these days.

55
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,381
After all this,
haven't you come to realize

56
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,550
you should mess around while you can?

57
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,176
Oh, cut it out.

58
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:06,389
So that's why I'm saying this.
You remember what I asked, right?

59
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:09,100
-The folder with password 1-0-3-0--
-Erase it immediately!

60
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:13,521
What sin did the bird commit?
Does it know what it contains?

61
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,773
Pitiful brown-eared bulbul!

62
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:19,569
Why is she worrying about
the brown-eared bulbul?

63
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,907
See, I was right.

64
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:31,539
Then do we now have to call Dr. Kang
sister-in-law?

65
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:35,001
She's not our sister-in-law.
They'd have to get married first.

66
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,378
Can't you stick to the rules?

67
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,549
Personally, I don't like Dr. Kang.

68
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:43,468
What do you mean?

69
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:47,263
She's a doctor who makes good money
and she's pretty. What's not to like?

70
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,723
That's why I don't like her.

71
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,560
Why would a pretty woman,
who makes a lot of money, date a soldier?

72
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:54,228
Is she doing it out of pity?

73
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:56,272
A heart that moved overseas?

74
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,649
You never know when it will change.

75
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,360
Imagine if she knew what we do.

76
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,363
"You're reassigned elsewhere?
Quit being a soldier."

77
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,489
Isn't it obvious?

78
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:11,662
You just don't get it!

79
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:17,001
What is Sergeant First Class Choi's
wife like?

80
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:18,878
Just like Dr. Kang.

81
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:21,381
She makes a lot of money
and she's super pretty.

82
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,175
Why is he being like that?

83
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:27,595
Sergeant First Class Choi
didn't give us our 20,000 of winnings.

84
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:30,390
Oh! Stop right there!

85
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:31,766
Catch him!

86
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:40,775
Nurse Ha, please organize a list of
medical supplies we need

87
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:42,443
and send it to Seoul headquarters.

88
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,112
So to recap...

89
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:46,948
Dr. Kang confessed her love
to Captain Yoo, right?

90
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:50,535
In this situation, Captain Yoo
confessed his love to Dr. Kang first.

91
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,499
I see you all got well-educated
in gossip when I wasn't around.

92
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,252
Here. Let's focus.

93
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:01,796
First group to depart tomorrow--

94
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,424
-So today is day one as a couple?
-Starting tomorrow.

95
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:07,760
-No, today would be the first day.
-Right?

96
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,637
Newbie, you don't have to join in.

97
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,683
For those of you whose day one is...

98
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,981
Can't all of you just go back to Korea?

99
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:35,788
I'll check your blood pressure.

100
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,042
Excuse me, doctor.

101
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:43,004
Do I have to receive treatment
from this man?

102
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:44,714
Why?

103
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:47,133
He's the one who first discovered you.

104
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:48,885
That's why.

105
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:52,597
I keep remembering that time
and it's making me so angry.

106
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,765
His hand is shaking too.

107
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:02,023
Let's see then. Who would he switch with?

108
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:04,942
Ah, Schweitzer? How about Schweitzer?

109
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,444
But there's a language barrier.

110
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:10,198
Or Jang Joon-hyuk, but he died.

111
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:13,034
What can we do?
We have no hands to switch him out.

112
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,747
Your primary doctor is not a TV channel.

113
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:21,626
You can't change your doctor as you wish.

114
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:24,253
If you want to recover, get treated.

115
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:26,881
Treat him, so he'll recover fast.

116
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,305
It's 120/80. Everything's fine.

117
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:43,147
Damn it.

118
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,284
Oh, my!

119
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,182
What are you doing?

120
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,561
-Nothing.
-You were doing something.

121
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:25,481
It looked like you were avoiding people
because you're embarrassed.

122
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,442
-Just go the way you were going.
-You have some guts,

123
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:31,571
thinking about dating
the Special Forces Alpha Team Captain.

124
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:37,952
First Lieutenant Yoon,
let me ask you something.

125
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,161
Ask away.

126
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,205
Don't get all serious on me.

127
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,833
The military is my territory.

128
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,043
Lieutenant...

129
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:49,714
doesn't your boyfriend's job bother you?

130
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:53,009
"Will he get hurt? Will he disappear?"

131
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,969
Are you not scared of those things?

132
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,971
I don't know well,

133
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:01,142
but Master Sergeant Seo also does
dangerous work like Captain Yoo.

134
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:03,060
To be precise, 

135
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:06,981
they use various land, sea, and air routes
to penetrate behind enemy lines,

136
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:10,610
to make a reconnaissance of
guerrilla warfare, rescue hostages...

137
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:14,155
induce surrender, and so on,
risking their own lives.

138
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,702
I'm more afraid of being separated

139
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:22,705
than of what he does.

140
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:27,293
So I'm not afraid of anything
since we're under the same sky.

141
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,337
Simply put, I'm blinded by love.

142
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:31,797
That's how I feel.

143
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,497
What's with the misery?

144
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,249
It's not misery, it's anguish.

145
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,503
Let me ask you about something.

146
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:15,257
Have you ever been bothered
by your boyfriend's occupation?

147
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,385
Why is everyone asking me that?

148
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,553
Talk to each other. The two of you.

149
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,348
Kang Mo-yeon asked me
the same thing just now. 

150
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:26,018
What was your answer?

151
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,728
Hear it from her yourself.

152
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,730
This isn't an intelligence war.

153
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,899
A face-to-face war is the answer, Captain.

154
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:33,901
Look who's talking.

155
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,821
I'm always in a hand-to-hand war.

156
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,282
What is this?

157
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:44,412
-Who are you gonna throw it at?
-I was still deciding. Give it here.

158
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:46,706
Try stealing it.

159
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,208
You are going to regret this. Come here.

160
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,668
Can't you beat me?

161
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,721
That's why I told you to come here.

162
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:04,098
You two are looking quite intimate.

163
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:05,808
What?

164
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,227
Can't I be friendly with another man?

165
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,437
Are you still mad?

166
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,938
Shouldn't I be mad?

167
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:14,191
It's not like I'm asking
for three times a day.

168
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:17,111
When no one's around
do you have to run away like that?

169
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:20,072
Go and do roll calls
for the rest of your life.

170
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:25,953
That?

171
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,707
That thing, where you...

172
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,876
Not that.

173
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:37,506
Holding hands, hugging.
That's all I'm asking.

174
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,091
But he's always like this.

175
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,510
He hasn't once held my hand properly

176
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,763
and if he does,
it's always my arm or shoulder.

177
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:45,681
Idiot.

178
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,229
The target is him. Throw this at him.

179
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,319
Idiot.

180
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,821
Stop. I will toss our ranks aside.

181
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:04,033
Why? Because my rank is on my shoulder?

182
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:07,203
Gosh, you are so consistent. 

183
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,206
Gosh, what an idiot.

184
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:23,385
Four! One, two, three!

185
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,930
I'm tearing up
because we get to see this again.

186
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,599
It's like we've come back to normal life.

187
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:33,687
It's nice that muscles and abs constitute
a normal life.

188
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:36,273
Two, three, four! One!

189
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,775
This must be a symbol of peace.

190
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:42,947
-They're Uruk's white doves.
-Coo coo coo coo!

191
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,074
Four! One!

192
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,326
You said there's a meeting
with the U.N. Camp.

193
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:49,912
-Aren't you late?
-One, two, three, four!

194
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,121
I'll just be late.

195
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,709
Captain Yoo! Hello!

196
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:59,255
One, two, three, four!

197
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:01,465
One, two, three, four!

198
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:10,808
Two, three, four!

199
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:12,852
She is so gullible. 

200
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,646
Maybe there was more than a kiss.

201
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,648
Nurse Choi.

202
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:19,650
Yes?

203
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:25,239
Do people really kiss
in between their work?

204
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,032
What?

205
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,752
You scared me!

206
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,754
But why are you here?

207
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,548
How are you here again?

208
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,009
I've been here for a while.

209
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,347
Are you being fooled?

210
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:51,682
This is all because of--

211
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:55,060
I'm very busy.

212
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,396
I have to go to a meeting. So, bye.

213
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,565
I have to go to that meeting too.

214
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,151
It seems I've just found someone
that needs me to give them a ride.

215
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,068
I'll go by myself.

216
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,695
So you can hang off a cliff again?

217
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,363
If that happens, I'll call you.

218
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,199
Why do you keep running away?

219
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,785
You avoid me
because I confessed my love.

220
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:13,871
You avoid me after putting me
in your will.

221
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:15,247
That wasn't a will.

222
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,583
-You said your heart fluttered.
-That wasn't me.

223
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:21,587
I'm not asking how you feel about me.

224
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:30,137
Let's not think that you've lost
because your heart was revealed

225
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:33,724
because it's made me like you a lot more.

226
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:39,271
By the way...

227
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:43,692
you seem to resemble
something extra pretty today.

228
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,819
Stop it!

229
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,451
I'll see you at the main gate
in ten minutes.

230
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,808
"A logic the persuader
should not propose is...

231
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:19,228
One: You can readily persuade
20 million compatriots.

232
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:22,022
Two: Find a country better than yours--"

233
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,024
Are you going to take the GED?

234
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:27,403
Yes, a man should at least be
a high school graduate.

235
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,572
Since you're a nurse who can do
acupuncture...

236
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,867
-Did you go to an eastern medicine school?
-I didn't go to college.

237
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:36,954
My father was an eastern medical doctor,
so I learned by watching.

238
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:39,164
So you're saying you're not certified?

239
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,125
No, I don't have a qualification.

240
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,585
Then I will stop there. Thank you.

241
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,839
Stay still! One wrong move
and your nerves will get messed up.

242
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:47,756
Okay.

243
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,511
By the way, where is your hometown?

244
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:55,097
Your accent is a little different
from ours.

245
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,016
I'm a Goryeo, Korean-Russian.

246
00:16:57,725 --> 00:17:00,185
Goryeo? That Goryeo?

247
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:02,730
Isn't that a really old dynasty?

248
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,982
The nation Choi Soo-jong established?

249
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,651
Wow, the people from
Goryeo are still alive?

250
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,239
Jeez, how will you pass this exam?

251
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:19,038
I thought the meeting would be
very strict, but everyone was funny.

252
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:21,999
For people who meet in adverse conditions,

253
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:23,625
humor is a must-have trait. 

254
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,627
I see. that's why.

255
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,505
You do the same thing too.

256
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,549
During serious situations, you joke.

257
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:33,927
If you're serious in a serious situation,
it's all too serious.

258
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:39,933
How does it feel
to do what you have to do?

259
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,351
Are you proud?

260
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:42,895
You can't date. 

261
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,314
I see.

262
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:49,401
Speaking of which...

263
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:52,696
How many boyfriends have you had?

264
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,908
Why do men always ask that question?

265
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,785
Who's the bastard
that asked you before?

266
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:14,968
What was that?

267
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,471
I'll check. Don't move, stay still.

268
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:36,949
Why? What is it?

269
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,285
If I'm right,
it was an anti-personnel mine.

270
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:42,162
What, a mine?

271
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:55,425
Was it really a mine?
Did we really go over a mine?

272
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:56,718
Yes.

273
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:00,430
It seems like the earthquake shifted
some of them down here.

274
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:03,142
So don't go anywhere by yourself.

275
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,478
We are in the middle of the mine field.

276
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:09,106
What do we do now?

277
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,153
My cellphone doesn't have reception!

278
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:21,410
The radio isn't working either.
Give me your bag.

279
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:27,708
What are you going to do?

280
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,085
Don't we have to wait
until we get rescued?

281
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,547
Just hold onto these.

282
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:38,051
Come with me.

283
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,642
We're going to get out of this place.

284
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:47,895
But how? There are mines all over.

285
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:49,938
Just follow where I place my foot.

286
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,275
I won't let you die, so don't be scared.

287
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:07,289
If you step on a mine, what happens?

288
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:10,417
There's no going back.

289
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,087
Unlike in the movies, if you step on one,
it always explodes.

290
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:15,422
Okay.

291
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:19,885
Step here. This time it's a long step.

292
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,429
You can do it, right? Hold my hand.

293
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,522
-I did well, right?
-In many ways.

294
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,693
-Be strong.
-You too, Captain.

295
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:44,868
Is that a mine?

296
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:48,705
Yes, it's an M16-A1 mine.

297
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,251
Do you have the red flags
that I put in the bag?

298
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:54,920
Here you go.

299
00:20:58,131 --> 00:21:01,218
The only way to avoid
a mine is to go slowly.

300
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:03,637
Relax.

301
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,265
And look at my sexy ass.

302
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,728
It's moments like this
when your jokes give me strength.

303
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:16,817
"Relax" was the joke.

304
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,318
I was being serious after that.

305
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,153
Seriously...

306
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:00,777
You did well. 

307
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:02,988
You did really well.

308
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:05,449
How many times is this? 

309
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,701
I'm always almost getting killed.

310
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,536
And I wrecked two cars.

311
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:10,787
True.

312
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:15,292
I want us to be in a romantic movie,
but we always end up in an action movie.

313
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,921
Since you've ruined two cars already,
let's ruin your lipstick, too.

314
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,799
Do you have the lipstick
you're wearing now?

315
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:46,990
It's done. Let's go.

316
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:48,784
Just a minute.

317
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:58,293
There will be people
who don't know English.

318
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,762
I'm not trying to complain, 

319
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:12,349
I'm just asking
so I can get a sense of reality.

320
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:15,685
Do we really have to just keep walking?

321
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,145
For now.

322
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:21,775
Since it took us about 40 minutes
to drive 60 kilometers,

323
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:24,111
we have about 40 more kilometers?

324
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:27,531
With the speed of a Special Forces Team,
we'd arrive tonight.

325
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:30,283
But we'll probably get there
around tomorrow morning.

326
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:35,163
If you don't want to just walk,
should we hold hands?

327
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,792
-No!
-Even though I'm in your will?

328
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,210
I said that wasn't me!

329
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,839
I just saved you and here you go again.

330
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:48,427
Are you a person who changes
before dying and after surviving?

331
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:52,556
You're different in the morning
and afternoon.

332
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:56,601
Me? How am I different in the morning
from the afternoon?

333
00:23:56,685 --> 00:24:00,439
In the morning you're extremely pretty,
in the afternoon, you're amazingly pretty.

334
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:04,151
Be honest.

335
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:06,445
You've dated many women, right?

336
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,572
Why do all women ask that?

337
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:13,160
If I say I dated a lot, you'll get upset.
If I say I didn't, you won't believe it.

338
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:17,164
Who's the upset woman
and who's the one that didn't believe you?

339
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:19,416
Oh, a truck.

340
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:22,752
Oh, so you dated a truckload of women?

341
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,716
Over here! Help please!

342
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:39,102
-I guess your beauty doesn't work here.
-What did you say?

343
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,147
Oh, there's another car.

344
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:45,317
Do you want to ride in it?
Should I just take it? I have a gun.

345
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:47,360
Stay still over here.

346
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,740
Over here!

347
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:55,744
Over here! Over here!

348
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:01,124
That is a good idea. Let's take a car.

349
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:14,304
Universally, all farm drivers are nice.

350
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:17,849
You're also very different
before and after getting a ride.

351
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:20,852
Thanks for saving me again.

352
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:24,147
I was strong because I had your help.

353
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:25,732
I'll live well.

354
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:28,151
With another guy? 

355
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:31,780
Don't, if you're gonna live with
another guy.

356
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:40,455
I heard you asked Myeong-ju, whether her
boyfriend's occupation worries her.

357
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:43,041
She told you that already?

358
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:45,043
She told me to hear the answer from you.

359
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,338
What did Myeong-ju say?

360
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:54,719
First Lieutenant Yoon said
Master Sergeant Seo's work is

361
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:57,097
less scary than being apart.

362
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,224
What about us?

363
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:05,564
Will we be apart soon?

364
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:12,779
Are you on the list of
medical team members going to Korea?

365
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,407
I'm not.

366
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:18,451
You're not?

367
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:20,954
No, I'm not going.

368
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:23,081
Why not?

369
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,584
It's probably not because of me.

370
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,210
It is because of you, Captain. 

371
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:30,297
I'm staying because of you.

372
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:34,467
Because I want to be
with you a little longer.

373
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:39,514
I think I just confessed my love.

374
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,058
Should I apologize?

375
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,477
How do you know I'll accept your apology?

376
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:52,045
You went through a lot today.

377
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,964
I have to go prepare the roll call.

378
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:58,802
You worked so hard.
I have to go check on the patients.

379
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:01,096
Solidarity.

380
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:18,863
She'll be really embarrassed later.

381
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:21,116
He must have been really happy earlier.

382
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,867
I wish I could take it off of her.

383
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:24,828
I wish I could go hit him.

384
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:28,790
What?

385
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:30,917
I wish I could hit you.

386
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,965
It really hurts!

387
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:30,388
It's even hard to turn my head like this.

388
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,098
It hurts a lot!

389
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:33,516
What's going on?

390
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:37,729
Someone who was fine yesterday is saying
he's hurt today.

391
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:39,188
He might die tomorrow.

392
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,065
Don't you know about after-effects?

393
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,234
People even feel it after car accidents,

394
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:46,070
but I am a patient from an earthquake,

395
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:48,072
and I'm also a victim of assault! 

396
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:49,866
Please be quiet.

397
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:52,827
Nothing is wrong, according to the X-ray.

398
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,120
Yes.

399
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:58,041
In this day and age, you are flying doves.

400
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,209
Hey, you.

401
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:02,712
What would show up
in these useless X-rays?

402
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:06,424
I want to get a proper MRI
in a big hospital in Seoul.

403
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:09,510
Give me a ticket for a patient's seat
on the first plane.

404
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,304
How many times do I have to tell you?

405
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:12,764
There aren't any more seats.

406
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:16,809
So are you here to book your ticket
in the Medi Cube?

407
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:19,812
-You're out of your mind.
-How dare you!

408
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:23,900
If I tell you to get me a seat, do it.

409
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:25,735
I'm Jin Young-soo! And you...

410
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:29,906
This wench thinks she's something,
wearing a uniform.

411
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:31,074
I'm going to--

412
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,992
Let's talk outside, quietly.

413
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:34,869
Continue with your work.

414
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,996
Let go, let go of me!

415
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:38,247
Don't stare at me!

416
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:42,418
Let go of me. You're not letting go?
I told you to let go of me and talk.

417
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:43,920
Let go, I'm going!

418
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:55,556
Hey! Did you hit me? You low-rank punk!

419
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,059
You want to be a patient?

420
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:01,104
Where and how do you want to get hurt?

421
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:07,235
Do you want me to break here?

422
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,697
What about becoming a lefty?
I can make that happen.

423
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,702
And an air hole would be good too.
Tell me.

424
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:19,497
I can make you stay in bed
for the rest of your life.

425
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:24,877
No, in my urgency, I misspoke.

426
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,546
I admit it.

427
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:30,341
Go out and reflect. You know where the
main gate is! I'll give you five seconds.

428
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:32,719
One second, two seconds, three seconds--

429
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:34,012
Hold on!

430
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:39,559
I don't normally make mistakes.

431
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:42,395
I'm sorry.

432
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:46,941
Oh, Doctor. I apologized.

433
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,527
Could you relay my apology to them?

434
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:53,197
Do you need a seat on tomorrow's plane?

435
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:54,824
What?

436
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,247
-I'll call you. Bye!
-See you!

437
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,832
-Safe flight.
-I'll be going.

438
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:04,375
Bye!

439
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:31,903
Is Chi-hoon really not going?

440
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,866
Did that person steal his seat?

441
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,286
He has to leave now to catch the plane.

442
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:43,956
Did you find him?

443
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,043
No. I can't find him. He must be hiding.

444
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:48,544
Just go.

445
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:50,922
Safe flight and call me when you arrive.

446
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,174
Yes, we'll get going.

447
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:55,468
Come back safely, everyone.

448
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:56,886
-I'll be going.
-Goodbye.

449
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:10,942
Is something wrong with Dr. Lee?

450
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:14,320
Yeah, he has been acting strange lately.

451
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:16,280
He's been wearing the same socks
for days.

452
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:18,116
And he hasn't matched colors either!

453
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:22,203
So this is where you are!

454
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,705
Where were you hiding all day?

455
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,708
I looked here earlier.

456
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:33,381
Did everyone leave?

457
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:35,091
They all left.

458
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,469
But why aren't you going,
causing such a fuss?

459
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:43,391
It's not like I don't know how you feel.

460
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:46,561
Dr. Jang put on a lot of weight
even for being pregnant.

461
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:50,690
I'm sure you don't have that urge
to see her like when you were newly wed.

462
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,109
Hey, but still...

463
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:57,905
you might not want to go home
when you're in the countryside,

464
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,241
but you're halfway around the world
in Uruk!

465
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:02,034
This is too far.

466
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:07,957
Yes, it's too far.

467
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:11,377
That's why I couldn't go.

468
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:15,965
Because if I run away that far...

469
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:19,635
I'm not really a doctor.

470
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:25,057
Lee Chi-hoon,
I'm only going to ask this once.

471
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:28,352
Is something going on with
patient Kang Min-jae?

472
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:31,147
What is it? I can help you.

473
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:34,525
Later.

474
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:40,823
Even getting someone's help
feels like running away.

475
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:46,495
I'll try to do it alone for now.

476
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:49,582
If it doesn't work,

477
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:55,171
I'll tell you then.

478
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:32,119
Are you targeting her head?

479
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,288
I'm targeting her heart. 

480
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:37,333
The target is so pretty.

481
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,174
Team firearm check complete.
The results are normal.

482
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,055
There's nothing wrong
with my firearm either.

483
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:53,599
The firearm looks fine,
but the shooter seems strange.

484
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:55,142
That's not right.

485
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:58,187
I'm not taking any more questions.

486
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:00,815
Harry Potter transmitting.
Can you hear me, Wolf?

487
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,819
Wolf transmitting. What is it?

488
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:07,530
Yellow Tiger is scheduled
to arrive tomorrow afternoon.

489
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,118
Who's Yellow Tiger?

490
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:15,079
-You don't know?
-I don't know.

491
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:19,542
Yellow Tiger is the Commander's call sign.

492
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:22,837
You mean my father?

493
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:27,758
In the afternoon, a VIP from Korea,

494
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:31,303
the Special Forces Commander,
will visit our base.

495
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:34,306
Don't sigh.

496
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:38,477
I, as the captain,
won't tactlessly make a fuss

497
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:41,897
just because we have a three star general
visiting us.

498
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:49,780
As usual, we'll weed the field
near the storage.

499
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:51,407
And as we always do, 

500
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:55,786
we'll wash the washroom with toothpaste
until it sparkles.

501
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,622
Never making a fuss about it.

502
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:02,585
We'll maintain the base
and clean up the supply storage as usual.

503
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,713
Very naturally, as we always do.

504
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:08,299
Understood?

505
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,109
Just the same as usual.

506
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:30,029
Captain.

507
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:34,408
The Commander is scheduled to meet
with the U.N. General.

508
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:37,328
-So his visit to our base was canceled.
-Canceled?

509
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:41,540
When we look no different than usual?

510
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:45,836
Instead, he directed us to come meet him,
along with the medical team leader.

511
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,506
The Deputy Commander is getting ready too.

512
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:03,103
I told you not to worry about me.

513
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:06,232
I'm not worried. I'm still mad at you.

514
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:11,195
How should I address Myeong-ju's father?

515
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:15,032
Mr. Soldier?

516
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,668
Platoon, Attention!

517
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:28,212
For the Lieutenant General, Present Arms!

518
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:29,755
Solidarity!

519
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:44,436
Order Arms.

520
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:46,855
Thank you for your efforts.

521
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,858
Lieutenant Colonel Park Byung-soo!

522
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:52,528
Colonel Kim Jung-ho!

523
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:08,669
Division Commander,
before the briefing starts,

524
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:11,880
I'd like to use your office
for 30 minutes, privately.

525
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:13,132
Yes, I understand.

526
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:17,428
Yoo Si-jin, Seo Dae-yeong, Yoon Myeong-ju,

527
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:21,473
and Doctor Kang Mo-yeon.
Let me see you for a moment.

528
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:29,440
Now, everyone take a seat.

529
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:30,357
Okay.

530
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:32,276
We are okay.

531
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:43,162
Dr. Kang, you should've been a soldier.

532
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:46,373
-Pardon?
-I've heard a lot of your accomplishments.

533
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:49,126
I'm talking about the Arab VIP's surgery.

534
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:53,547
With courage like that,
you could've been an outstanding soldier.

535
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:54,548
Too bad.

536
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:57,801
Thank you for the kind words,
but I like to sleep in.

537
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:01,305
That must be why you're so pretty.

538
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:06,226
Whatever the process has been,
your work has benefited the nation.

539
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:09,730
-I'd like to give you special thanks.
-I hope to see you again.

540
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:11,940
That's all I have to say to you.

541
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:15,277
Yes, then...

542
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:29,166
I received the report you worked hard
after the earthquake.

543
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:31,835
Did any of you get hurt?

544
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:32,878
No, sir.

545
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:34,963
Good.

546
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:39,176
Then from now on, putting my rank aside,

547
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:42,137
I'm asking as Myeong-ju's father.

548
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:44,473
Starting with Yoo Si-jin.

549
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:47,768
Captain Yoo Si-jin.

550
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:53,315
Yoo Si-jin, are you a friendly
or an enemy force to me?

551
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:54,983
Make your stance clear.

552
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:59,571
Do you really have no interest
in my daughter as a woman?

553
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:00,656
Dad.

554
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,830
She's my most cherished subordinate.

555
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:09,373
However,

556
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:12,000
during the the past seven years,

557
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:15,087
I haven't once thought of her as a woman.

558
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:20,342
I'm sorry to hear that.

559
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:26,098
I understand. You're dismissed.

560
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,940
-Why are you coming out already?
-Wasn't it a serious discussion?

561
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:36,734
It was. 

562
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:39,069
I was kicked out right after that.

563
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:42,906
-From the military?
-No, from the Commander's sight.

564
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:46,910
Today I was officially fired
as a potential son-in-law.

565
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:51,665
-Then...
-Yes, the love triangle is over.

566
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:56,003
I'm a man with a history. Is that alright?

567
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:04,803
Then what will happen to
Lieutenant Yoon and Sergeant Seo?

568
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:06,430
Who knows?

569
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:10,434
Because Master Sergeant Seo
always has the difficult task.

570
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:24,615
What do you think?

571
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:28,243
You met Seo Dae-yeong again.
Do you still like him?

572
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:29,745
Yes, I do.

573
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:35,876
Seo Dae-yeong, do you feel the same way?

574
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:40,464
-Ask me. Why do you keep asking--
-Yes, I do.

575
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:48,263
I thought we had the same thoughts.

576
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:53,268
Losing this fight for the sake of
First Lieutenant Yoon...

577
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:58,774
Seo Dae-yeong, answer me.

578
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:01,485
My answer--

579
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:04,446
It doesn't matter what he says.

580
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:05,823
I'm not going to leave him.

581
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:24,675
I will hold only this hand.

582
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:31,473
Do you think that's a hand
you're qualified to hold?

583
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:34,601
I will go wherever I'm deployed,
as I always have.

584
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:37,437
However, I won't let go of this hand.

585
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:41,316
Yoon Myeong-ju, go outside.

586
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:42,442
I don't want to.

587
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:45,988
-Say it while I'm listening.
-I told you before.

588
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:48,198
Don't worry.

589
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:02,170
In my 30 years of military life,
there were only two things I wanted.

590
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:05,173
An honorary commander.

591
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:08,385
And respect from my daughter
who follows in my footsteps.

592
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:16,226
It appears I failed on both accounts.

593
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:20,856
The orders I've been giving you
are unjust.

594
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:24,026
And my daughter doesn't respect me.

595
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:27,112
Anyway.

596
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:32,034
Since I know your true feelings,
I'll tell you mine.

597
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,119
I'll get to the point.

598
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:37,372
You can date Myeong-ju.

599
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:42,252
Of course, this decision
also includes marriage.

600
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:45,130
Are you serious?

601
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:49,217
I am.

602
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:59,144
However, I have no intention of having
a Master Sergeant son-in-law.

603
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:01,605
Instead, quit being a soldier.

604
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,024
Take off your uniform,

605
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:07,235
and work for Myeong-ju's company.

606
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,238
In the company,

607
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:13,700
I'll put you in a position
where you can strengthen your skills.

608
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:17,371
Think about it until your deployment ends.

609
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:21,416
When you return to the country,
come back with your decision.

610
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:24,753
Whether you'll let go of that hand
you're holding,

611
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,756
or become a man worthy of holding it.

612
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:51,113
What are you thinking about?

613
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:55,158
About Lieutenant Yoon and you.

614
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,328
Myeong-ju and me?

615
00:49:58,954 --> 00:49:59,788
Yes.

616
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:03,458
No matter how much I think about it,
I just don't understand.

617
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:05,127
Why didn't you date Myeong-ju?

618
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:09,047
She's young, good education,
from a good family, and has a great body.

619
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:10,799
She has no flaws whatsoever.

620
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:16,680
Do people just date anyone who's pretty
and from a good family?

621
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:19,725
So you think she's pretty.

622
00:50:20,308 --> 00:50:21,977
I didn't say she's pretty.

623
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:24,813
Are you jealous?

624
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:27,816
Why don't you come here?

625
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:39,327
Why are you changing the subject?

626
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:42,205
You should've gone out with her
if she was so pretty.

627
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:44,791
How pretty is Yoon Myeong-ju?

628
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:50,422
What are you doing?

629
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:53,300
I was just covering your mouth,
but in a sexy way.

630
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:54,593
Continue.

631
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:56,428
Just go away.

632
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:08,065
When is this going to be done?

633
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:12,819
It was done a while ago.

634
00:51:13,945 --> 00:51:15,072
I'll go and pay for it.

635
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:27,292
Catch that boy. Catch that thief!

636
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:35,425
What's going on?

637
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:42,808
The kid is sick and stole
whatever medicine he could find.

638
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:45,227
Let's take him to the Medi Cube.

639
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:48,230
No, we have to go to this child's village.

640
00:51:49,147 --> 00:51:51,066
He has a high fever, spots, and a rash.

641
00:51:51,149 --> 00:51:52,901
If my diagnosis is correct,

642
00:51:53,026 --> 00:51:55,070
he has measles
and it's an infectious disease.

643
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:58,156
We have to get it under control
before it spreads.

644
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,784
No way, are you serious?

645
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:04,371
-If you want to take it back, say so now.
-This is your last chance.

646
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:06,790
Really? For real?

647
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:10,210
You're sure he approved!

648
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:14,506
Yes, that's right.

649
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:17,050
I, Sergeant Seo Dae-yeong,

650
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:19,136
am officially permitted
to date Liutenant Yoon.

651
00:52:19,761 --> 00:52:21,930
This, I report! Solidarity.

652
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:26,768
But why?

653
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:28,854
What is this? What am I gonna do?

654
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:32,023
Are you sure that's my dad?

655
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:34,776
Is he terminally ill or something?

656
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:36,778
I should give him a call.

657
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:39,614
I can tell if it's the truth
just by hearing his voice.

658
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:40,615
I'll get going.

659
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:49,624
What do you know?

660
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:31,249
Big Boss transmitting, I'm at the village.

661
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:35,128
Confirm the GPS coordinates.

662
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:37,255
Transmission failed. Can't hear you.

663
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:50,769
Solidarity.

664
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:54,981
We checked the coordinates
before we lost him.

665
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:56,274
But something is strange.

666
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:58,944
According to the this map,
there's no such village.

667
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:02,364
Really? You know that peacemaker doctor? 

668
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:05,200
-Try to get hold of him.
-Yes, sir.

669
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:26,388
How long have the kids been sick?

670
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:31,977
I don't think they understand you.

671
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,521
It is measles, so what should we do?

672
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:37,649
We have to gather all the kids
and do a check up.

673
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:43,780
What a relief. 

674
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:45,323
That child can speak English.

675
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:35,290
What is this place?

676
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:38,418
This is Phantom Village.

677
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:42,172
War orphans live in this village
and they are usually controlled by gangs.

678
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:46,176
They sell people and kidnap the kids,
instead of protecting them.

679
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:52,223
Phantom Village?

680
00:55:53,224 --> 00:55:56,936
There are cases where gang members
trade all the kids in the village.

681
00:55:57,270 --> 00:56:00,231
They are always on the move,
so it is called Phantom Village.

682
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:09,199
Hold on a second.

683
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:13,411
You should hurry. I think
the house owner just returned.

684
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:00,375
Stay behind me.

685
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:14,055
Do you know him?

686
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:16,349
Who is he?

687
00:57:19,018 --> 00:57:20,019
Private Ryan.

688
00:58:48,566 --> 00:58:50,318
I don't think I should save this guy.

689
00:58:52,403 --> 00:58:54,030
I think I should just let him be.

690
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:56,241
If I save this guy,

691
00:58:57,116 --> 00:58:59,202
more people will end up dying.

692
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:01,538
Save him.

693
00:59:03,122 --> 00:59:05,375
Do your job as a doctor.

694
00:59:07,293 --> 00:59:08,586
If we have to kill him,

695
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:13,633
I should be the one to kill him.

696
01:00:01,848 --> 01:00:02,682
Nobody is around.

697
01:00:02,807 --> 01:00:04,517
