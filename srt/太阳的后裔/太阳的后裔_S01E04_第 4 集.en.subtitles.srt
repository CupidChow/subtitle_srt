1
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:30,363
Can you save this patient?

2
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:32,032
What?

3
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,368
I won't know until I open him up,

4
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:39,205
-but he's bleeding in the biliary tree--
-Enough complicated stuff.

5
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:42,625
Tell me if you can save him or not,
as a doctor.

6
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,255
What are you doing?

7
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:48,590
Answer me.

8
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:52,761
I can save him.

9
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:01,561
Then save him.

10
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,369
We're moving the bed
to the operating room.

11
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,835
Now, protecting the medical team
and the patient is

12
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:28,088
our first and foremost duty.

13
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:32,842
Team, line up in front of the guns.

14
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:44,104
From this moment on, whoever is a threat,

15
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,689
I give you permission to shoot.

16
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:03,873
We're transporting him now.

17
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,212
EPISODE 4

18
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:54,340
The VIP is now in the operating room.

19
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:57,760
Our team and Mubarak's guards have
their weapons drawn at each other.

20
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,597
Medically speaking,
our team's decision is right.

21
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,225
Making the right medical decision is
not what's important right now!

22
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,978
We're talking about President Mubarak
of the Arab League!

23
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:08,938
What happens if something goes wrong?

24
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:13,026
If something goes wrong, our government
will have problems with every Arab nation!

25
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,529
We will start the surgery. Scalpel.

26
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:28,166
You crazy bastards! Stop right now!

27
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,589
Yoo Si-jin! Seo Dae-yeong!

28
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,884
Why isn't anyone answering me!

29
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:49,520
Solidarity!

30
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:53,233
The special forces are in full armor
at the drill ground. Taebaek Unit--

31
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:57,487
You think I don't have ears?
I got it, so get the car ready!

32
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:59,239
Solidarity.

33
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:06,246
Because of you bastards,
we've been placed on FPCON One.

34
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,081
We are about to go to war now.

35
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:12,794
Whoever can hear me,
make sure you tell Yoo Si-jin this.

36
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:16,422
Go get the doctors and stop the operation
now. Hand over the VIP.

37
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:20,635
Or else I will shoot everyone
for disobedience!

38
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:28,101
You won't be able to turn back.
If you change your mind--

39
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:29,519
Over here.

40
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,064
This is a subcostal incision, right?

41
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:35,441
There wasn't any record of
surgery on his chart.

42
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:39,195
That's why you shouldn't trust anything

43
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,614
that you haven't confirmed for yourselves.

44
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,574
That is why this operation is dangerous.

45
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:47,120
The patient, us, and even the soldiers
that are outside...

46
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,872
If we stop because it's dangerous,
this patient will die.

47
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:53,167
As doctors, we really don't have
any choice in the matter.

48
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,678
We will cut the abdomen open now.

49
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,165
This patient had a GB surgery before.

50
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:37,837
The adhesion between the tissues is
severe. We'll start by removing this first

51
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:41,382
in order and with precision. Bovie.

52
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:50,099
His blood pressure is dropping too much
too suddenly.

53
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,101
Pump more blood into him.

54
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,356
-It's going down even further.
-What do we do?

55
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:59,067
If something bad happens to him,
are we all going to die?

56
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:01,069
I'm a father now...

57
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,917
It's up to God.

58
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:22,799
This won't do.

59
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:24,592
We don't have time.

60
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:27,970
Let's just take care of the adhesion,
and stop the bleeding--

61
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,264
Nurse Jang, do the transfusion faster.

62
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:34,227
We can handle this amount of bleeding.

63
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:38,064
After removing the adhesion,
we'll take care of hemorrhage.

64
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:41,109
Just do it in the order we planned.

65
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:42,652
But--

66
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,071
Stop whining.
Ten more packs of red blood cells.

67
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,658
We will start again.

68
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,580
We will proceed with adhesion removal.

69
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:10,847
-What's the situation over there?
-They are still operating on him.

70
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,982
I think the Arab head doctor has arrived.

71
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:43,212
It's good now.
We were able to repair the aneurysm.

72
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,506
Blood pressure is stabilizing.

73
00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:00,730
Good.
Clean up and do the angiorrhaphy calmly.

74
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:46,984
You think we don't know that?

75
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,033
Are you okay?

76
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:00,915
I will stay here. Go get some rest.

77
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,333
I'm fine.

78
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,086
I am just a little hungry.

79
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:09,924
Why don't you go get some food?

80
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:11,717
We will be able to rotate later.

81
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,052
Yes, ma'am.

82
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,596
By the way...

83
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,933
What do we do if he doesn't wake up?

84
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:26,274
There will be a case report on
the hepatic artery aneurysm,

85
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:31,362
and world history will change...

86
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,531
BLUE HOUSE DIPLOMACY VIP ROOM

87
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,283
Any problems during recovery?

88
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:40,746
Although the surgery went well,
post-surgery is where we need to--

89
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,456
You don't need to explain anything.

90
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,792
We are just left with
the results of the surgery.

91
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:49,088
We were able to avoid the worst kind of
friction, like an armed clash,

92
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:52,216
but we need justification
for diplomatic measures.

93
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,429
We should take anticipatory measures
regarding the ones accountable.

94
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:09,650
This is the Commander.
Connect me to the signal corps.

95
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:16,657
Sergeant First Class Seo, can you hear me?
This is the Commander speaking.

96
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,743
Solidarity.
This is Sergeant Seo Dae-yeong.

97
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:24,624
Dismiss Captain Yoo Si-jin of his duties
for disobeying orders,

98
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:26,751
and prepare to apprehend him.

99
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,134
I know.

100
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:37,762
As your superior,
I am proud of your actions.

101
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,221
You've worked hard.

102
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,141
But my order still stands.

103
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:43,976
Carry out my order.

104
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,421
Sergeant Gong Cheol-ho.

105
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:20,096
Captain Yoo Si-jin,
for disobeying orders,

106
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,599
you're dismissed as Commander
and will be taken to temporary detention.

107
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:44,453
Please take care of
the follow-up measures.

108
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:03,806
Is he really keeping an eye on us?

109
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:07,351
I don't think he's standing there
hoping to get some cup noodles.

110
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,483
It hasn't been three minutes yet.

111
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:16,360
It's not that.

112
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:20,364
I keep questioning myself
if I counted the gauze correctly.

113
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:24,243
You don't think it's inside the patient
and we just sewed it up, right?

114
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:28,122
What kind of joke is that?

115
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,208
Besides, Nurse Ha is as sharp as a knife--

116
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:34,420
Should I go back and count again?
How many did we have originally?

117
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:35,755
What are you saying now?

118
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:41,844
As per the orders,

119
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:45,556
you will wait in the storage supply room
until further detention notice.

120
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,645
I wish it had been the food storage area.

121
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,360
Solidarity.

122
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,864
Seo Dae-yeong, wait outside.

123
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,034
Solidarity.

124
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,043
You crazy bastard.

125
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:18,214
The Captain is detained
and the squad is a mess.

126
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:21,884
-I apologize.
-So what did you do to be sorry for?

127
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:25,888
Do you know how many people
might lose their jobs because of you?

128
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,808
-I have nothing to say.
-Of course, you don't. 

129
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:36,065
If you just kept out of trouble,
you were on track to get promoted.

130
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,651
Why are you shooting yourself in the foot?

131
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,154
I have no regrets.

132
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,866
I am the one that made these decisions.

133
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:49,870
I will take responsibility for everything.

134
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:56,919
You better stand by what you just said.

135
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,968
Where is Captain Yoo?

136
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:06,136
He's on standby for detention.
No visitation.

137
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,764
Please, just for five minutes.

138
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:17,523
Seo Dae-yeong, where is that
crazy doctor named Kang Mo-yeon?

139
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,276
Go get her.
I want to put a name to a face.

140
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,695
When the VIP wakes up--

141
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:26,407
I'm... Kang Mo-yeon.

142
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:33,789
No news about the VIP yet, huh?

143
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:35,583
We are waiting now.

144
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,669
Anybody can say that.
What if he doesn't wake up?

145
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:45,175
The diagnosis and treatment were all based
on medically rational decisions.

146
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:47,761
You are confident.

147
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:52,641
You don't care about anything here.
You can just open your clinic later.

148
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,896
You ruined Yoo Si-jin's life.

149
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:03,235
He just blew a decade's worth of
service and future success.

150
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:07,156
If the VIP doesn't wake up,
then the rest of his life is done for.

151
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,575
Thanks to your so-called
rational decision, doctor.

152
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,500
Try and make sure he wakes up.

153
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:23,255
At least our careers can go on.

154
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,177
I am asking you a favor here.

155
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,063
Solidarity.

156
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,238
-The VIP's situation will be reported--
-Shut it.

157
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,908
I don't want to see your face.
Pack up and go.

158
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,660
Your transfer order is still active.

159
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:55,996
When the Company Commander
is  unavailable, as second-in-command--

160
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,624
You should've been like this earlier
and stopped him.

161
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,585
Do you also want disciplinary action?

162
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:06,048
Staff Sergeant Choi, you will be
the temporary commander.

163
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,051
Seo Dae-yeong, obey my orders and go back.
Understand?

164
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,135
Yes, I understand.

165
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,892
You two listen to me carefully.

166
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:19,937
If you get investigated upon your return,

167
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,898
Yoo Si-jin is the one solely responsible
for this.

168
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,441
Keep that in mind.

169
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,278
Go.

170
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,466
Are you leaving now?

171
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,176
I will be leaving at 21:00.

172
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:55,848
Have you thought about not leaving at all?

173
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,350
Why don't you resist it this time?

174
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:03,939
I'm not escaping through choice,
it's an order.

175
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,070
I am sorry that I have to leave
at a time like this.

176
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:12,948
I will report for the transfer right now.

177
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:16,910
I've been dismissed.
I'm no longer your direct supervisor.

178
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:20,122
Why would you want to report to me?

179
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:27,296
The command from my direct supervisor
today was all correct.

180
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:34,428
All the commands I received from my
direct supervisor today were honorable.

181
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,683
I will see you back home,
Company Commander, sir.

182
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:47,232
I'll buy you drinks
for three days straight.

183
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,246
I report to you.

184
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,708
As of May 24, 2015,
I, Master Sergeant Seo Dae-yeong,

185
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,336
have been ordered to transfer to
the Special Forces.

186
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:10,214
End of report. Solidarity.

187
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:12,966
Solidarity.

188
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:26,522
It is 20:50. You have exactly 10 minutes.

189
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,992
Excuse me. This is Kang Mo-yeon.

190
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,665
Let's get going.

191
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:46,834
Yes, sir. We will get going now.

192
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,065
I am so glad to see you.

193
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,069
Are you here to see me?

194
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,578
I'm sorry.

195
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,831
You don't owe an apology, Dr. Kang.

196
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:32,379
The patient hasn't woken up yet.

197
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:39,928
Don't you think you have too many men
to worry about?

198
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,182
Don't be so such an easy woman.

199
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:47,352
From now on,
you should worry only about me.

200
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:53,734
When I saw you earlier,

201
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:57,196
I realized what you said before was true.

202
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,282
What?

203
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,411
That you are sexy in the operating room.

204
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:05,913
But why did you do it?

205
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:12,377
You had another option
in that situation earlier.

206
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,756
It didn't have to be that way.

207
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,049
I told you already.

208
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:20,636
Beautiful ladies, elders,
and children should be protected.

209
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:21,887
That's my rule.

210
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,349
Beauties and my elder.

211
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:29,895
They were both right in front of me.
I wasn't able to look away.

212
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,570
You were very brave today.

213
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,199
Do you know that?

214
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,793
Are you crying right now?

215
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:03,220
Is it okay in there? Do you need anything?

216
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:04,888
I need C-4 or RDX.

217
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,849
What is that?

218
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,226
It's a bomb.

219
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:14,481
I was okay until now, but I suddenly
want to break the door and get out.

220
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:15,774
Because of somebody.

221
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,491
How can you joke right now?

222
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,287
I know I shouldn't.

223
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:31,456
And yet, I pulled it off.

224
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:33,500
I did.

225
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,050
I think time's up.

226
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:53,395
Here. Thought you might need it.

227
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:01,486
I will get going now.

228
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:03,697
Thank you.

229
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:08,285
It is just what I needed.

230
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,957
MOSQUITO COILS

231
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:48,051
This man is not sick anymore.

232
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,222
What are you doing? Step away!

233
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:56,059
What's wrong?

234
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,732
President, can you see me?

235
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,070
Follow my fingers.

236
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:17,581
He woke up! He woke up!

237
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,665
We're alive.

238
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:22,461
I thought my 37 years of
life would end here.

239
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:25,964
The patient lives to save the doctor.

240
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:27,174
It's really a relief.

241
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:30,051
My family may be well off,
but even we couldn't handle that.

242
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:33,263
Ah, your family isn't that well off?

243
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:37,350
This was the second time in my entire
medical career that I was that scared.

244
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,060
When was your first?

245
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,854
When I operated on her mother.

246
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:43,607
I was so nervous something would go wrong.

247
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:48,153
The patient is being transferred.

248
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:53,283
Attention! Present Arms!

249
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,055
Order Arms.

250
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:21,811
The VIP is on the way to the city
with his practitioner.

251
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:26,024
I heard that the surgery was a success
and the atmosphere is not so bad.

252
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,527
The situation is resolved.

253
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:29,986
That's a relief.

254
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,905
Yes, don't worry.

255
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:33,782
Please travel safely.

256
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:38,411
There is a whining kid next to me,
so I will turn on the speakerphone.

257
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:42,749
This is Communications and Information
Services Private Kim Gi-beom.

258
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,834
How could you do this to me?

259
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,879
How could you just leave like this?

260
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:52,551
Of course, I just left.
I left the dictionary with you.

261
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:55,178
Continue your preparation
for the GED exam.

262
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:58,598
Staff Sergeant Choi,
watch him to make sure he studies.

263
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:00,600
Yes, I will make sure he does.

264
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:02,644
Solidarity.

265
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:05,522
Okay. Work hard. I'm hanging up.

266
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:52,861
You are exactly the person
I was looking for.

267
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:55,447
But you are here. What do I do now?

268
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:59,117
Where are you going?

269
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,037
Are you running away again?

270
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,124
I am asking if you are running away again.

271
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:14,549
Master Sergeant Seo Dae-yeong.
I was ordered--

272
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:22,057
to return home.

273
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,646
Say it's a feigned retreat.

274
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:31,941
Tell me to wait for you.

275
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:37,656
Tell me that you will return at all costs.

276
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:47,707
There are lots of mosquitoes.

277
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:50,543
Be sure to wear your uniform
even though it's hot.

278
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:16,528
What is this?

279
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,448
What do you want me to do?

280
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,785
Please take care of yourself
at your deployment area.

281
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,293
Solidarity.

282
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:40,719
Why hug me? Why touch me?

283
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,888
If you touch me, be responsible for it!

284
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:47,016
You said you can't be happy
with lingering feelings.

285
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,728
You are considerate when it comes to
other women.

286
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:52,564
Why don't you at least do that for me?

287
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:00,655
Did you love that woman a lot?

288
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:03,074
Why are you curious about that?

289
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,536
Revenge has certain levels
and intensities.

290
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,582
I made a promise to her
that I would make her happy.

291
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:16,337
I don't think she will be happy
if you mess up her wedding.

292
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,340
People can't be happy
if they have lingering feelings.

293
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:24,053
You are not going for revenge,

294
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,766
you're going to be considerate?

295
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:31,770
BRIDE'S WAITING ROOM

296
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:40,737
How did you...

297
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,364
I was wondering who you were
getting married to.

298
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,074
I saw him here.

299
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:46,618
Don't tell me you greeted him.

300
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:47,869
I can, on the way out.

301
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,162
Please that's...

302
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:55,877
Nice to meet you.
Congratulations on your wedding.

303
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:57,545
Who is she?

304
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,964
Thought I might need to say hello.

305
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:02,342
Thank you for letting this man go.

306
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:04,969
I am Staff Sergeant Seo's girlfriend.

307
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:10,517
It's awkward to call each other ex and
current girlfriend, call me Doctor Yoon.

308
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,810
I am a doctor.

309
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:15,480
-Is she really your girlfriend?
-I have nothing else to say.

310
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,905
I think I can live without thinking
of you, thanks to this person.

311
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:30,453
So live well without regret,
since you're the one who left.

312
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:34,249
I sincerely congratulate you
on your wedding.

313
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:45,468
Do you regret it?

314
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:49,264
No, it feels good.

315
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:54,435
I feel regretful.

316
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:55,895
What do you mean?

317
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:57,981
I don't know.

318
00:30:58,064 --> 00:31:00,775
Well, I feel a little strange.

319
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,612
Since I did my part,

320
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:07,490
don't forget to tell
Captain Yoo Si-jin that we're dating.

321
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:08,700
Don't worry.

322
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:18,751
I said, "I wouldn't marry Yoo Si-jin."

323
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:21,588
When did I ever say that I was never
going to get married?

324
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:23,506
What the heck did you say?

325
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:28,845
I only said what I promised to say,
"I am dating Yoon Myeong-ju."

326
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:35,184
Then what's up with rumors around the base
that we slept together?

327
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:37,604
The soldiers are imaginative?

328
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:43,443
Staff Sergeant Seo,
do you find this funny?

329
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:46,321
I don't find it not funny.

330
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,075
Is this about someone else?

331
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:53,620
Guys think dating and
sleeping together are the same?

332
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:56,748
That's what men do. Don't worry about it.

333
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:59,542
If you worry about it, you're sleeping--
I mean losing.

334
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:03,755
-I'm sleeping what?
-My mistake.

335
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:05,131
Don't try to be funny.

336
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,967
Is sex all men think about?

337
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,844
Because of this, I'll always be sleep--

338
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:13,890
It'll be a losing fight.

339
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:20,980
I may not know how to win,
but I know how to make the score even.

340
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,231
How so?

341
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:24,943
We can just make the rumors true.

342
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,779
Make the rumors true...?

343
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:30,990
What do you see me as?

344
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,492
Are you okay?

345
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:35,078
-I didn't know you were like this!
-I'm sorry.

346
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:36,371
How could you?

347
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:42,210
First Lieutenant Yoon Myeong-ju has
arrived at the Taebaek Base in Uruk.

348
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:46,005
And Master Sergeant Seo Dae-yeong
left the Uruk airport at 13:00.

349
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:50,343
It's a call from the Blue House.

350
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:51,386
Connect me.

351
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,810
-This is the Commander.
-This is Lee Hyun-soo.

352
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:05,024
The Arab League made an unofficial request
regarding the surgery on the VIP.

353
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,652
To put it simply,

354
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:10,154
they insist that,
"There was never any surgery."

355
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:12,782
Therefore,
"No visit was ever made to Medi Cube.

356
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:17,412
We don't want any records to remain
on this matter." 

357
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:22,041
Our government has promised
full cooperation on this matter.

358
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:27,213
As for Captain Yoo Si-jin, whether he is
to be disciplined or commended,

359
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:30,174
we will respect the Army's decision.

360
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:33,553
We will take the necessary measures.

361
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:39,809
Yoo Si-jin is still in detention, right?

362
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:41,352
Yes, that's right.

363
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:45,523
Expunge all records regarding the surgery,
and release Yoo Si-jin.

364
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:47,191
Move forward with the hearing.

365
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:50,236
A disciplinary hearing
instead of a commendation?

366
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:54,490
Connect me to the Major General
of Taebaek Base.

367
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:03,875
There are these many beans in Uruk?

368
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:08,379
None of you guys stopped this? Huh?

369
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,132
For our Commander
who spent two days in detention

370
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,342
and has been safely released from prison,

371
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:15,720
I have prepared cubes of tofu

372
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:19,057
with tofu stew on the right
and tofu-kimchi on the left.

373
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,934
-I've made a star-shaped ones too!
-"Released from prison?"

374
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:23,895
Am I wrong?

375
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:26,981
Then you've been released from jail?

376
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:29,942
From jail?

377
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:33,863
I was only locked up for a detention.

378
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,281
I see.

379
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:36,866
What's wrong with him?

380
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:38,701
I'll teach him more.

381
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:41,704
First, take this.

382
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:45,416
You two were saved by Staff Sergeant Choi.

383
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:52,882
-Everybody, attention!
-Attention!

384
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:54,801
The Commander has something to say.

385
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:59,097
We had an emergency,
and the second-in-command was gone too.

386
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,182
But you all worked it out.

387
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:03,768
Tonight is a tofu night.

388
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:06,687
But this weekend,
we'll have a pork belly barbecue.

389
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:10,858
Everyone enjoy your meal. That's all.

390
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,985
Thank you for the food!

391
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,161
Why are you leaving?

392
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:24,622
Aren't you here to see me?

393
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:27,792
Later. Enjoy your meal.

394
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:32,213
No. Let's talk now.

395
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:52,150
I thought you were posing as
a doctor, but I guess not.

396
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:54,193
-You really saved him.
-You said to.

397
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:56,529
Gosh, you listened well to that.

398
00:35:57,405 --> 00:36:01,200
I think you said to leave
the medical issues to the medical team.

399
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,452
Seems like you hold grudges.

400
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:05,329
You became carefree overnight.

401
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:14,922
You said to only say "thank you"
if you're thankful.

402
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:20,261
Thank you for trusting me.

403
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:26,601
It was really scary, right?

404
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:30,104
Honestly, a little, yeah.

405
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:33,357
You were scared too, right?

406
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,861
It's a situation that I'm quite used to.

407
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:46,120
And it kept bothering me,
but I didn't have a chance to say this.

408
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:50,625
When I said that there are TV doctors,
I didn't mean it.

409
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,212
Ignore what I said.

410
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:56,714
Well, you're not wrong.

411
00:36:57,548 --> 00:37:01,594
It's wrong to include a doctor who saved
a patient with a gun to her head.

412
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:04,805
Well, if you insist, I guess.

413
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:10,937
But do you think
he really would have shot me?

414
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:16,984
I don't want to hear it.

415
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,612
Don't tell me. Don't tell me.

416
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,198
Company Commander!

417
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:48,224
I heard my life was saved,
because of your quick judgment.

418
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:51,978
Because of that,
Allah has given me more time to work.

419
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:54,438
I thank you in Allah's name.

420
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:59,151
You have chronic heart disease,
so stress is really dangerous.

421
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:03,614
For the time being, you need to try
ignoring stressful problems.

422
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:11,455
Of course, doctors start nagging
regardless of nationality.

423
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,918
War is easy and peace is hard.

424
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:19,213
Perhaps that is why dictators
live a long life.

425
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:28,389
It seems like I can connect more
with soldiers than with doctors.

426
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:34,437
I will respect the doctor's
recommendations.

427
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,440
Allah must have a reason for all of this.

428
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:41,902
It was an honor to treat
such an astounding person.

429
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:46,324
I need to give you my gratitude.
This is a small gift of gratitude.

430
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,556
But, since you're giving me one,
can you give me two?

431
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:14,935
Since there are two of us
and this one can get wet and ruined.

432
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:30,368
I guess this card is like a free pass.

433
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:32,953
Give me one. I'll confirm it.

434
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:45,674
How could you use that card
for a mere rental car?

435
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:47,802
You could have got the whole
rental company!

436
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:49,470
Are you crazy?

437
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,974
I didn't know you were
such a thoughtless man.

438
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:57,228
Don't you have ambition?
Like there's stuff like oil!

439
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:59,438
Out here, oil can be
drilled from any backyard!

440
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:01,524
If we just sold that oil--

441
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:04,026
Ah, we were his lifesavers.

442
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:07,446
That man was ready in his heart
to give us anything!

443
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:11,200
Do you feel that wronged?
I think I used it well.

444
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:13,119
What do you mean you used it well?

445
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:17,998
I have two hours left to return to base

446
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:23,671
and if I step on the gas,
we can get there in 30 minutes.

447
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:27,091
So for the next 2 hours,
I'll be on a date with you.

448
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:31,971
Wow. You're crazy.
You used that card just for a date.

449
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:36,392
And who said I'd date you?

450
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:38,394
I wasn't asking for your opinion.

451
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:40,813
Let's have some tea.

452
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:42,898
You should ask for my opinion.

453
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:54,285
Oh, what a waste. What a waste.

454
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,956
This is mine,
so don't even think about touching it.

455
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:04,670
What should I use this for?
Should I start my clinic in Arabia?

456
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:08,299
I should've taken a photo with him!

457
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:11,218
I would've hit the jackpot
if I hung that picture in my clinic!

458
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:16,432
Why did you become a doctor, Dr. Kang?

459
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:20,227
Because I was good at the sciences,
particularly math.

460
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:21,812
That makes sense.

461
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,316
I thought a doctor would make
a lot of money.

462
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:29,320
I believe it's better to live with money
than to be chased by money.

463
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:33,574
Regardless of what others say,
I put in work for the return I get.

464
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:36,994
I think that setting up a hospital in
Gangnam is good business.

465
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:42,708
Sorry if you think I'm materialistic.

466
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:47,630
Why do you keep pretending
you are a bad person?

467
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:53,719
I convinced myself
I became a doctor to earn money.

468
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:57,598
Many things happened
while you weren't there.

469
00:41:57,973 --> 00:42:00,351
I've changed during that time.

470
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:05,648
I don't think you changed at all,
Captain Yoo.

471
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:07,942
I got more handsome, isn't it noticeable?

472
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,487
You still joke like before.

473
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,115
The way you smile is more attractive.

474
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:26,460
Excuse me.

475
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:31,048
Yeah, it is me.

476
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,716
U.N.?

477
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:38,764
Who?

478
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:51,026
-I am sorry.
-Again?

479
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:54,947
-You have to go again?
-Yes. For the car, Dr. Kang--

480
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,740
Our dates haven't changed.

481
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,618
Whether it's in Korea or here.

482
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:01,704
Where are you going?

483
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:03,414
You can't tell me?

484
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,293
Are you going somewhere you can't take me?

485
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:09,962
It isn't like you can't come.

486
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:13,090
There's just nothing to gain
from you going.

487
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:18,304
-Why do you always look for a gain?
-The work I do...

488
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:21,765
isn't good for our relationship.

489
00:43:24,226 --> 00:43:25,102
Even so,

490
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:28,147
what if I want to go with you?

491
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:19,907
Look there!

492
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:26,455
Kimchi. One...Two...Three.

493
00:44:26,538 --> 00:44:28,749
Kimchi.

494
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,356
It was a hard day. Get some rest.

495
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:37,025
Was he your friend?

496
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:41,780
The memorial service.

497
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:43,240
You waited a long time.

498
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:45,826
You must've been curious sitting
in the car.

499
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:51,081
We were comrades.

500
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:53,125
But why?

501
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:54,710
To keep peace.

502
00:45:56,128 --> 00:46:00,591
So what you're saying is that you too--

503
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:05,095
So let's not... talk about that.

504
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:11,810
Look, I told you it's not beneficial
for us to go together.

505
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:16,023
Sleep well.

506
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:18,919
Excuse me.

507
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:29,221
I haven't seen Captain Yoo around.
Did he go somewhere?

508
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:31,849
He's at the base.
Today is his disciplinary hearing.

509
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:33,642
Disciplinary hearing? What--

510
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,895
Didn't that all work out well?

511
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:38,689
It looks like it didn't.

512
00:47:39,147 --> 00:47:42,025
Military code says he'll go to prison
for disobeying orders.

513
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:45,571
How could you not know this? You insisted
on proceeding with the surgery.

514
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:51,994
URUK TAEBAEK UNIT
MILITARY HEADQUARTERS

515
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:55,414
We can't officially punish you

516
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:57,666
for your disobedience.

517
00:47:57,791 --> 00:48:02,921
But we have determined you've been
good and faithful so far.

518
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:07,384
For the situation on May 18,

519
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,845
you will get three months of
salary reduction

520
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:12,598
for not properly following regulations.

521
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:15,642
-Do you have any objections?
-No, sir.

522
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:20,105
Also, you won't be able to take
the promotion exam.

523
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:23,358
-Again, do you have any objections?
-No, sir.

524
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:25,068
Good. That's it.

525
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:26,653
Solidarity.

526
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:42,377
How did you get caught in
such a flimsy booby trap?

527
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:43,587
You little prankster!

528
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:47,966
-When did you get here?
-I came yesterday.

529
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:49,968
You did suffer a bit.

530
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:52,095
Don't respect me too much.

531
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,514
Hey.

532
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:57,267
Why didn't you start
your own clinic in Gangnam?

533
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:59,436
Why did you come to this black hole?

534
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:03,148
Can you believe this guy...
I have a goal too!

535
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:05,317
I'll put stars on my shoulders.

536
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:10,280
Since you're a troublemaker,
maybe I'll be able to get them before you.

537
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:12,991
Oh, congratulations.

538
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:17,371
Seeing that you aren't looking for
Sergeant Seo,

539
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:19,164
you probably know that he left.

540
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:23,210
I met him at the airport.

541
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:26,421
Is the airport okay?

542
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:30,217
Whose side are you on?

543
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:33,011
Well, I'm always on my country's side.

544
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:37,975
Thank you.

545
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:44,439
I've seen somewhere before.

546
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:46,191
Me too. Bye.

547
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,862
This situation arose because of me.
How can I look away?

548
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:54,741
Why does Captain Yoo Si-jin have to take
responsibility? He's not at fault.

549
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:58,370
How isn't he at fault?
Soldiers are to follow all orders.

550
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:04,835
You're a doctor, so you saved a life.
That's what a doctor does.

551
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:06,920
Army problems are different to
medical ones.

552
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:10,465
I was there, so I will serve as a witness.

553
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:13,885
I'll take responsibility for the things
I need to take responsibility for.

554
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:19,725
Look, doctor. This is not a court case.
Don't you not know his punishment?

555
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:24,396
Three months of salary reduction
with no chance to take the promotion exam.

556
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:26,648
Can you take responsibility
for these things?

557
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:32,029
Solidarity.

558
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:36,033
I am sorry. Please come outside.

559
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:53,008
Hello? What are you doing now?

560
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:57,721
Why did you do something
that useless?

561
00:50:57,804 --> 00:50:59,181
Useless?

562
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:02,434
-Because of me, a person's life--
-It isn't because of you.

563
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:06,354
Do you think I did that to save a girl?

564
00:51:10,525 --> 00:51:15,322
Do you remember the bullet wound
on my body when we first met in Korea?

565
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:21,578
On my first day as
a Special Forces Sergeant, my senior said,

566
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:25,373
"A soldier lives
wearing a shroud at all times.

567
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:29,878
When you die on an unknown battlefront
for your country,

568
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:35,133
the place you lay down becomes your grave,
and your uniform becomes your shroud.

569
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:38,845
You must wear the uniform with
such determination.

570
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:42,057
If you wear the uniform
with determination,

571
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:44,935
and are honorable,
there's no reason not to be."

572
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:52,275
I owe my life to that senior.

573
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:58,240
That's when I got that gunshot wound.

574
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:02,994
I'm saying that big or small,
all the decisions I make

575
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:05,956
take my comrades' honor, glory,
and sense of duty into consideration.

576
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:08,667
It applies to this as well.

577
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:11,336
I made a decision after considering
of all those things,

578
00:52:11,419 --> 00:52:13,463
and I don't regret my decisions,

579
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:15,382
but that does not mean

580
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:19,928
that the fact that I broke
military law can be disregarded.

581
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:26,893
The military will take care of
military problems,

582
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,728
so you should stay out of it...

583
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:32,774
Please.

584
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:41,658
My concerns have affected your job.

585
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:46,079
I am really sorry.

586
00:53:32,834 --> 00:53:34,377
Solidarity. Where are you?

587
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:36,880
Have you arrived safely?

588
00:53:37,672 --> 00:53:39,507
I'm on top of the road.

589
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:40,592
On top of the world?

590
00:53:41,426 --> 00:53:43,261
Road. The road.

591
00:53:43,678 --> 00:53:45,805
I'm on top of the road
leading to the barracks.

592
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:48,308
Are you saying that you're on
the way to the barracks?

593
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:52,812
No. Just a road. A long and winding road.

594
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:55,273
Oh, let it be.

595
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:57,901
Did you see Myeong-ju?

596
00:53:57,984 --> 00:53:59,653
Is that important right now?

597
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:03,156
I can't get a promotion
and I got a pay cut.

598
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,367
Of course you deserve your pay cut.

599
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:08,328
How much is this girl costing you?

600
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:10,705
It isn't because of a girl.

601
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:13,833
As a soldier, I protect our citizens
as the first priority--

602
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:15,794
Because that citizen was pretty.

603
00:54:15,877 --> 00:54:17,295
This guy, seriously.

604
00:54:18,713 --> 00:54:20,590
Did you call me just to do this?

605
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:24,052
I didn't call you to do this,
I am doing this because I called you.

606
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:27,264
Did you see Myeong-ju?

607
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:31,476
Sergeant Seo, do you even know
how much an international call costs?

608
00:54:33,895 --> 00:54:36,648
How much is this girl costing you?

609
00:54:57,335 --> 00:54:58,461
Solidarity.

610
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:02,132
-Okay. Good job today.
-Sure.

611
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:19,524
Put your hand inside the cupboard.

612
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:22,402
A pay cut along with failure to secure
a promotion,

613
00:55:22,777 --> 00:55:26,239
I thought you might want some alcohol
after a day like today.

614
00:55:38,376 --> 00:55:40,587
What's the matter?

615
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:43,465
I just came for some water.

616
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:46,551
Then why are you leaving?

617
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:50,597
I thought you wanted to be alone.

618
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:53,308
No, I want to be with you.

619
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:55,560
I've said that multiple times.

620
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:58,855
Don't go. Come with me.

621
00:56:11,284 --> 00:56:13,953
How about wine instead of water?

622
00:56:34,682 --> 00:56:37,018
Expeditionary soldiers are
not allowed to drink.

623
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:38,937
Didn't you bring it out to drink?

624
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:40,438
I was about to.

625
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:44,234
But now I am doomed
because now there's a witness.

626
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:55,995
I'm sorry for acting up before.

627
00:56:56,871 --> 00:57:00,458
I was going to apologize.
Let's just say we both did.

628
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:01,793
You didn't though.

629
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:08,425
Why are you scared again?

630
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:12,303
Did I go too far again?
How did you get here?

631
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:13,513
I ran here.

632
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:17,684
Only me would get here this fast.

633
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:21,855
I saw you earlier, getting out of a car.

634
00:57:24,065 --> 00:57:25,066
Oh, you saw.

635
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:28,236
Then why did you ask?

636
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,737
I wanted to hear a joke.

637
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:36,244
The uniform really suits you.

638
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:42,333
Although, it's not something to say
to a person who just got punished.

639
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:47,422
How do you know this is
the formal uniform?

640
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:49,757
Why wouldn't I know?

641
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:51,926
Women have fantasies about these uniforms.

642
00:57:53,386 --> 00:57:54,846
That's why I became a soldier.

643
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:03,855
Is it good?

644
00:58:04,689 --> 00:58:07,984
It's okay. Do you like alcohol?

645
00:58:12,113 --> 00:58:16,242
I wanted to watch a movie
and have a drink with you.

646
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:18,786
It could have been a perfect date.

647
00:58:20,371 --> 00:58:21,623
Did you watch the movie?

648
00:58:22,373 --> 00:58:23,416
No.

649
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:26,127
Why didn't you watch it?

650
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:31,341
Because it was a movie
I was going to watch with someone.

651
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:34,552
And I thought about it.

652
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:37,597
The next time I watch a movie with a guy,

653
00:58:38,097 --> 00:58:40,141
I should avoid a fun movie.

654
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:44,771
There were news articles about that movie,
it broke ten million viewers.

655
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:52,570
But that movie made me think about you.

656
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:04,374
You must want this badly. Here.

657
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:08,461
I can improvise.

658
00:59:41,452 --> 00:59:45,373
Do you know what Captain Yoo does exactly?

659
00:59:45,456 --> 00:59:47,750
I went against God's will for no reason.

660
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:49,836
A dying man was dying for a reason.

661
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:51,629
Please hurry up! It's breaking.

662
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:55,008
Please save me. Please save me.

663
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:57,677
Hang in there. I'm coming.
I will find you.

664
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,262
Who is the farewell party for?

665
00:59:59,345 --> 01:00:01,097
For the Company Commander.

666
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:02,890
Captain Yoo?

667
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:08,938
