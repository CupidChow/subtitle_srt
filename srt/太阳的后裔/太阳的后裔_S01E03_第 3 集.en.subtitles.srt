1
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:41,684
-Isn't that the soldier we saw before?
-I think it is.

2
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,441
I am in charge
of the medical team's  safety

3
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:49,400
during your stay in Uruk,

4
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:52,570
and the commanding officer,
Captain Yoo Si-jin.

5
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:53,530
Nice to meet you.

6
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:55,573
Hello.

7
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:58,409
From here, we will travel to
our destination, Mohr Airport,

8
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:02,205
aboard the transport helicopter CH-47,
which you can see behind us there.

9
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:11,965
During the transport, you can only carry
one military duffle bag.

10
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:16,344
-What in the world?
-How could this be?

11
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:23,476
You will be able to receive the rest
via land route tomorrow evening.

12
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:27,605
We will leave in 10 minutes at 13:25.

13
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:13,443
EPISODE 3

14
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:32,754
Welcome.

15
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:35,924
Welcome.

16
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:41,971
Welcome.

17
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,600
I looked so natural, didn't I?

18
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,769
-You sure did.
-I know.

19
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:50,855
The medical department is over there.

20
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:53,191
It looks like we'll be staying here.

21
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:56,986
I am almost 40.
It sucks to stay in military lodging.

22
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,072
I like it, it feels like a field trip.

23
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:03,368
Who is your mother
How did she raise you like this

24
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:08,081
Everyone!

25
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:14,712
The carrier is not here yet,
there's not much to organize.

26
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,547
That's good because I'm a bit tired.

27
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:19,968
Knock-knock.

28
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,554
How have you been?

29
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:26,975
You don't remember me?

30
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,939
The runaway from the ER?

31
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:35,566
Oh, yeah, that thief!? Oh, my goodness!

32
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,446
I am Private Kim Gi-beom.

33
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,409
What are you doing here?
This is so amazing.

34
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:47,287
I know!
Why don't you try to run on the spot.

35
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,080
You want me to run on the spot?

36
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,750
You sprained your right ankle.
I wanna see if you're all better.

37
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:59,132
I'm all better thanks to you.
I received a first class service.

38
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,926
So you are no longer a pickpocket?

39
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,428
I am Private Kim Gi-beom.

40
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:07,265
The Korean Army values honor and loyalty
and is united in brotherhood.

41
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:13,980
Quit doing that,
or the springs will pop open.

42
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:16,441
-You stop it.
-Stop what?

43
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:19,485
Stop unpacking.
Let's run away. It's now or never

44
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,822
Do you know how many ailments
you could get in a remote place like this?

45
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:25,283
-How many?
-I asked you because I don't know either.

46
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:29,162
Therefore, let's run before we get sick.

47
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:32,498
Hey, get out of here.
Go back to your tent.

48
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:35,376
Didn't you hear Kang Mo-yeon
talking with the Chairman?

49
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:38,338
They call it volunteer work,
but this is punishment.

50
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,965
Why should we be punished
for someone else?

51
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,926
I've already been punished for almost
30 years by knowing you.

52
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,055
-Is that how you really feel?
-You think it's a reward?

53
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,769
Pop open, spring! Pop open, spring!

54
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,520
What a child!

55
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,786
Sir, I need to inspect your camera.

56
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:17,668
Please delete these photos.

57
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:22,006
Right, it doesn't look good.
I'll take another one.

58
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,842
We are not allowed to have
our pictures taken.

59
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,469
Why not?

60
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:29,138
Due to military regulations,
I can't tell you that.

61
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,932
The soldiers here are like that.

62
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,850
They have so many secrets

63
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,228
they can't tell us
due to rules and regulations.

64
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,441
How do you know that?

65
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,766
Did he really not see me,
or is he just pretending?

66
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:52,305
-Aren't you going to open it?
-I can do it later, sir.

67
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:56,017
No. What if there are Choco Pies in there?

68
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,269
It's more likely a terrorist bomb.

69
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:00,021
Come on.

70
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,774
A man only dies once, not twice.

71
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,070
Open it up,

72
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,114
like a real man.

73
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:21,542
Red ginseng is probably for
Sergeant First Class Moon.

74
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,295
Guitar strings are for
Sergeant First Class Choi.

75
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:26,547
Staff Sergeant Gong gets a drama DVD.

76
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,845
What's so good about
her ex-boyfriend who left her

77
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,931
that she is sending gifts for his brother?

78
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,683
She's really hopeless.

79
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,644
That is why I'm upset.

80
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:45,691
Where is mine?

81
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:52,073
Bunch of cheapskates.

82
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:58,162
It seems like you didn't get
anything either.

83
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:03,167
My gift is on its way right now.

84
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,630
She's getting deployed here.

85
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:09,215
She's coming here?

86
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,593
Solidarity.

87
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:17,306
Reporting. On May 21, 2015,
First Lieutenant Yoon Myeong-ju.

88
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,476
Ordered to report to the medical corps at
Uruk Taebaek Unit, Mowuru.

89
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,187
This is my report to you, sir. Solidarity.

90
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,070
I will return safe and sound, sir.

91
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,281
You are going there after all?

92
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:36,534
Yes, sir.
I am very happy that I am able to.

93
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:39,662
As I've always told you.
I like Yoo Si-jin.

94
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,206
He's good enough to be
a general and my son-in-law.

95
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,752
The more you do this, the more difficult
it will be for Dae-yeong.

96
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,797
The personal greed of a superior
is a violation of military law.

97
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,842
Do you want to lose another, sir?

98
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,803
Seo Dae-yeong remained a soldier
because he understood me.

99
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,764
I never lost anyone working under me.

100
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,766
That's not because you were great, Father,

101
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,561
but because Dae-yeong is a real soldier.

102
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,898
That is the reason why I love him.

103
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:09,483
And why I can't lose him.

104
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:14,697
If you stop me going there again,

105
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,199
then you will lose
First Lieutenant Yoon Myeong-ju,

106
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,285
and your daughter Yoon Myeong-ju.

107
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,662
That's all for me to report.

108
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:25,583
Seriously? Myeong-ju's boyfriend
and that guy are really there?

109
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,585
Yes, they were deployed here.

110
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,630
I was so nervous at the airport.

111
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,007
It must've been obvious.

112
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,467
I'm sure it was obvious.

113
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:39,013
How can you meet each other again
halfway across the world?

114
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:40,222
Are you happy to see him?

115
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,351
What do you mean happy?
It's really uncomfortable.

116
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,102
Hello? Hello?

117
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,022
Can you not hear me? Hello?

118
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:49,774
-Mo-yeon.
-Hello?

119
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:54,153
-Kang Mo-yeon.
-I can hear you. Hello?

120
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:01,494
Ah, I guess this really is
the middle of nowhere.

121
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:33,484
Hey. That's dirty. It's dirty.

122
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:35,945
Wait.

123
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:45,579
Eat this.

124
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:53,713
-I want it too.
-Me too.

125
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:02,555
You shouldn't give any,
if you can't give some to everyone.

126
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,232
You recklessly crossed
the reserved area fence.

127
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:15,109
You crossed it, too.

128
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:16,902
You didn't even think about it.

129
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:26,454
Go to the training unit.
There's a party over there.

130
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,664
You know Sergeant Choi, right?

131
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,916
Yes!

132
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:35,713
What did you say?

133
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:37,214
I said leave, or I'll shoot.

134
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,300
Don't lie.

135
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,136
I call this a joke.

136
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,348
I'm leaving first.

137
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,274
Don't move!

138
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:05,826
You just stepped on a landmine.

139
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:09,121
What? A landmine?

140
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,081
Yes, on the right. I said don't move!

141
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:14,627
Really? Did I really step on a mine?

142
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:18,130
What do I do? Will I die?

143
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:26,806
After years in the army, I've never seen
a person live after stepping on a mine.

144
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,767
How can you say that?
Are those things a soldier should say?

145
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,185
Do something!

146
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,437
You said you were in the special forces!

147
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,981
In the movies, they use a MacGyver knife

148
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,609
to disassemble the explosive! 

149
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,864
I've been in the field for 25 years,

150
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,827
and I've only seen one person
disassemble an explosive

151
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,495
with a MacGyver knife.

152
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:53,207
See? There are such people. Who was it?

153
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,962
The main character of the movie you saw.

154
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:01,799
Hey, you jerk!

155
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,222
Did you just curse

156
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:10,808
at the person who can help you?

157
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:14,311
You said that you can't.
What should I do now? Am I going to die?

158
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,313
You won't die.

159
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,148
Is there a solution?

160
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:19,942
Lift your foot.

161
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,196
I'll step on it instead.

162
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,994
What do you mean? It won't explode then?

163
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:33,581
It will.
I'll stand on it and die instead of you.

164
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:36,250
That doesn't make any sense.
What are you saying?

165
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,168
Why would you die instead of me?

166
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:42,089
Hurry up and bring someone better.
There must be a solution.

167
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:44,592
Stop giving up because you can't do it. 

168
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,844
Hurry! Hurry up!

169
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:05,237
What is this? Why isn't it exploding?

170
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:07,239
Have you been well?

171
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:12,036
What is this? Was it a lie?

172
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:16,957
It was all a lie.

173
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,961
It was a lie. It was all a lie. Really!

174
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,130
What are you doing?

175
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,885
Are you okay? I was just...

176
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,138
Forget it. Don't talk to me.

177
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:32,556
Don't follow me either.

178
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,905
Here! Have some. It tastes really good.

179
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:48,822
Leave some for me.

180
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,909
What should I leave you?
Should I leave mostly meat?

181
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,456
Did something happen?

182
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,793
-I made her cry.
-Already?

183
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,504
I'm shocked at myself as well.

184
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,353
Wait. I'm sorry.

185
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:23,774
My joke went too far.
I'm used to playing with guys.

186
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,943
I'm really sorry.

187
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,197
I understand.

188
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:17,494
It's nice to see you again.

189
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:49,359
-Count off!
-1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, End.

190
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:52,738
Total count, nine. None missing.
All here, ready for lights out!.

191
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,740
-At ease.
-At ease.

192
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,451
Private Kim Gi-beom!

193
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:02,623
Hey!

194
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,668
-Are you alright?
-Yes.

195
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:44,498
They probably do this every morning,
right?

196
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:49,128
If they do this at night,
I'll just live here.

197
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:52,131
Let me know as soon as you decide.
I want my rent deposit back.

198
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,391
Did the noise stop you
from getting a good sleep?

199
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:05,185
I'm sorry,
but can you move aside a little bit?

200
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,317
What's the schedule for the medical team?

201
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:13,777
Morning or afternoon?

202
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:18,323
Squad, mark time.

203
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,493
-Halt.
-One, two!

204
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,120
End your morning run.

205
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,998
Quickly head back to the barracks.
You're dismissed.

206
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:29,042
-Dismissed! About face!
-About face!

207
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,004
Morning and afternoon.

208
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:34,798
What's your schedule like?

209
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,002
Here.

210
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,046
Hey, hey!

211
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:16,215
Are we going in order of rank?

212
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,175
When I take blood out, it hurts.

213
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:20,093
I usually like pain, Doctor.

214
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,013
What's wrong?

215
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,557
-Solidarity!
-Solidarity!

216
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:32,064
Excuse me. Please come here first.

217
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:33,148
Don't just go.

218
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,694
It's going to sting.

219
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,699
This is weird.

220
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,534
Why can't I find the vein?

221
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:49,414
An officer always carries
a gun, one that's loaded.

222
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:52,084
Really? Then you should shoot me.

223
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:54,711
Is it here?

224
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:59,466
I didn't put it in yet.

225
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,977
If you're still angry
because of yesterday's joke...

226
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:13,480
I don't hold grudges
because of things like that.

227
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,109
Is it here?

228
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:18,777
-It's here.
-Oh my goodness!

229
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:27,244
Fill the vial with blood.

230
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:28,996
Yes.

231
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,918
-You've all been working hard.
-Hello!

232
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,628
-Sir.
-Hello.

233
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,755
Hello, sir.

234
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,799
Did you receive the package?

235
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:44,678
I received it and I stopped by
to say hello for a moment.

236
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,180
Thank you, as always,

237
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:49,433
for letting us use your service.

238
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:51,143
No worries.

239
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,521
We should play soccer for
our barbecue day.

240
00:21:58,567 --> 00:21:59,651
What is this?

241
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,615
This is your commanding officer.
Report.

242
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:07,326
Nothing out of the ordinary.

243
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,369
Seems like a car accident
near the mountain.

244
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,455
If it's the mountain road...

245
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:14,833
Did our truck roll over?

246
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:44,738
It looks like a U.N. cargo truck.

247
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:47,199
We'll check to see if there are survivors.

248
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,233
Isn't he a U.N. relief worker?

249
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:07,112
U.N. relief workers aren't allowed to
carry guns, but he has a gun.

250
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,365
They have Foreign Legion tattoos

251
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:14,870
and their clothes don't fit properly.
Why are they pretending to be U.N.?

252
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:27,966
After checking with the U.N.,
their I.D.s and the car were fakes.

253
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:44,941
We need to report this to headquarters.

254
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:47,611
Reports are probably stacked.

255
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:52,991
Solidarity!

256
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:57,454
Are you alright? Is anyone hurt?

257
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:59,581
It was just a traffic accident.

258
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:01,333
Everyone must have been flustered.

259
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:03,919
Well, we're all used to emergencies.

260
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,963
That's a relief. Well, I have work to do.

261
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:10,217
-I'll stop by headquarters.
-Yes, sir.

262
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:15,847
I'm sorry, but can you tell me
the WiFi password?

263
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,557
You mean the troops' WiFi?

264
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:21,853
Sorry, we're not allowed to disclose it
to the public due to security regulations.

265
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:25,565
Really? What should I do...

266
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,609
There's an internet cafe in the city.

267
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:30,487
Luckily, the Captain will pass by it.

268
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,782
He can probably give you a ride.
Am I right?

269
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:38,954
Deputy Chief,
are you out of your mind?

270
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,122
Have a safe trip.

271
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:42,290
Solidarity!

272
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:03,812
Yes. I can sign the contract right now.

273
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,816
I'm abroad, but I can do internet banking
on my phone.

274
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:12,070
Yes. Then I'll send it in an hour
and send you a text message.

275
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:13,947
Okay.

276
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:17,701
Are you moving?

277
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:21,079
No, I'm going to quit the hospital
and open my own clinic.

278
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:23,331
The scandal with the Chairman?

279
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:25,458
How did you know?

280
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:29,129
That's what the medical team talks about
when you aren't there.

281
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:35,093
I guess he wasn't a good guy.

282
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:37,429
I wouldn't have come here
if he was a good guy.

283
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:41,308
I didn't step aside for you to meet
that type.

284
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,226
I didn't meet him but--

285
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,437
It's a long story.

286
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,815
Anyway, the reason I'm here
isn't pretty.

287
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:54,696
What is that place?

288
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:57,198
TO SACRED TEMPLE
WHERE WEEPING MARY WAS FOUND

289
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:02,203
It's far.

290
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:05,040
Did I ask about the distance?

291
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:09,419
Are you upset with me?

292
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:11,963
-Says who?
-You're making a fuss right now.

293
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:13,131
About what?

294
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:25,435
This is the closest town to the barracks.

295
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,228
Learn the landmarks.

296
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,522
I might not always be with you.

297
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:31,524
Okay.

298
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:41,534
Wait. You just need the internet, right?

299
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,255
This isn't the same place,

300
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,257
but this place has faster internet.

301
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:58,343
Are you here?

302
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:02,138
It's the guy that acted arrogant before.

303
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:05,892
Did the owner change?

304
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:07,352
Wasn't this Daniel's shop?

305
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:09,854
Did Daniel say that he's the owner?

306
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:11,564
Daniel and I are both owners.

307
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:14,818
Then, Daniel...

308
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,987
I heard he was banned
from entering the country.

309
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,031
That fool.

310
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:23,284
Even if he prohibition is revoked,
my store is off limits!

311
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,622
Who is she?

312
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:30,625
Is she a doctor from
the Korean medical team?

313
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:35,338
She is! That ethanol scent!

314
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:40,135
Who is she?

315
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:43,138
A nurse from the Peace Maker's
emergency relief.

316
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:45,849
She works part-time here.

317
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:49,686
Ah, she does a meaningful job,
which doesn't pay much money.

318
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:51,187
I'm doing it because it's fun.

319
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:53,523
I don't need money.

320
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:58,737
Are you a fortune teller?

321
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,990
How did you know
my full and part-time job?

322
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:05,744
I think I heard it from Daniel,
about his Korean-Russian wife.

323
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:07,454
What do you mean "wife"?

324
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:10,457
We're just comrades.

325
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,543
What did you come here to buy?

326
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:16,087
We've everything except Daniels.

327
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:18,339
Can we use the WiFi?

328
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,175
Oh, WiFi?

329
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:24,471
Let's see, the WiFi is...

330
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:27,348
Are you sure that the WiFi works here?

331
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:32,187
If you search thoroughly,
you'll find missiles, too.

332
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:38,777
Wait here after you finish your business.
Just an hour.

333
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,781
I'll leave the doctor here for a moment.

334
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,743
Don't fight.

335
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,037
She has a gun.

336
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:54,042
Excuse me.

337
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:55,627
Don't worry.

338
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:58,338
I'm sure there's a router somewhere.

339
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:06,429
On Friday at 0900,

340
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:10,433
we handed one man and one deceased,
assumed to be black market dealers,

341
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:12,185
over to the authorities.

342
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:13,561
The situation is resolved.

343
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,940
I got the report, but...

344
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:20,693
they're not some lowly weapons dealers
at a local market.

345
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,738
No one knows how closely connected
they are with anyone.

346
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:27,659
I know that you, Alpha team,
have no fear...

347
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:31,538
but they have no fear
and don't adhere to the law.

348
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,443
They are arms smugglers.

349
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:47,989
In other words, merchants of death.
It's best not to run into them.

350
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:52,952
Hey, you know better.

351
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:00,001
We don't have much longer
until we go back.

352
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:03,338
When you go back,
you and I will get promoted.

353
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,965
Let's avoid things that can be avoided.
Alright?

354
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,051
Yes, I understand!

355
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:10,303
Write a detailed report.

356
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:14,557
Yes, I understand.

357
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:15,975
And take this.

358
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:19,646
There is an order for an urgent transfer.

359
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,565
For Master Sergeant Seo?

360
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:26,694
To be transferred to the Special Forces
by the Commander of the Special Forces.

361
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:33,034
I understand. You may go.

362
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:49,425
Halt!

363
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,970
Attention!

364
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:54,055
-Solidarity.
-Solidarity.

365
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:56,516
Companies 3 and 5, dining as usual.

366
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:58,309
-At ease.
-At ease!

367
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,728
You've all suffered at training.

368
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:04,482
Since I came here to eat,
don't mind me and just eat.

369
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,693
Yes, sir.

370
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:40,935
Sgt. Seo Dae-yeong.

371
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,979
Sergeant Seo Dae-yeong.

372
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:46,816
You're dating my daughter, right?

373
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:49,110
Yes, that's right.

374
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,781
I worry about my daughter's future.

375
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:55,533
I wish

376
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:58,995
you'd consider my daughter's future too.

377
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,166
I believe you know what to do.

378
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,710
Do it in the most sensible way.

379
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:11,549
Is that an order?

380
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:14,260
I hope it doesn't have to be,

381
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:18,473
but I'll make it one if I have to.

382
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,561
Whether we can be honorable to each other,

383
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:26,606
depends on your choice now.

384
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,411
MASTER SGT. SEO DAE-YEONG

385
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:52,006
Your gift is on its way,
Master Sergeant Seo.

386
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,760
I miss you every day. Solidarity.

387
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:01,849
Did the transfer go well?

388
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:08,064
Thanks to you.
But did something bad happen?

389
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,944
My comrade has been
ordered to return to Korea.

390
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:15,613
The sheriff.

391
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:18,699
The non-commissioned officer?

392
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:22,954
You studied a lot.

393
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:29,460
Are you envious your close comrade is
going home early? Or are you sad?

394
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,840
I'm frustrated
because the order is unfair.

395
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,259
You said you always follow an order.

396
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:38,052
This order is...

397
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:41,889
not made as a Commander, but as a father.

398
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:48,688
This melodrama with
Yoon Myeong-ju's father must be

399
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:50,940
still in the screening process.

400
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:54,610
I've been curious...

401
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,446
How did Myeong-ju
and Sergeant Seo meet?

402
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:03,744
-Fight on!
-Fight on!

403
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:06,122
-Fight on!
-Fight on!

404
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:09,417
There was a joint march.

405
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:11,043
Go up.

406
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:15,715
Yoon Myeong-ju was the Army Surgeon
in service at that time.

407
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:27,602
I'll carry your gear for you,
so I'll kill you if you give up.

408
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,562
-Yes, I understand!
-Go on up.

409
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:40,740
This is the third time you've come back.

410
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:43,367
-What's wrong?
-Take off your boots.

411
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:46,787
It's great you care for your fellows
and want to win this,

412
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:50,249
but you can be medically discharged
due to the state of your feet.

413
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,754
Staff Sergeant Seo Dae-yeong.

414
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:57,715
Even if I do get discharged,
I am determined to be first.

415
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:06,891
Your determination isn't to get a vacation

416
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:08,768
to crash your ex-girlfriend's wedding,

417
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:09,977
is it?

418
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:12,021
It is.

419
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:14,941
Really?

420
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:19,987
Really.

421
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:21,822
Get out.

422
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:23,991
Why here?

423
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:27,370
We're going to that sea from earlier.

424
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:29,538
It'll be better to go now
before we get busy.

425
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:37,255
You said it was too far.

426
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:39,006
I know.

427
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,759
I want to be with you for a long time.

428
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,219
This way.

429
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:55,731
Sergeant Major Seo ended up going to
his ex-girlfriend's wedding

430
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,024
with Myeong-ju.

431
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:00,194
If you're curious, follow me.

432
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,905
Together? Why did Yoon Myeong-ju go?

433
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,463
Why are you here?

434
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:23,134
Congratulations on crashing your
ex-girlfriend's wedding.

435
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:25,678
Lucky for you, I'm also off duty.

436
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:27,263
Isn't that a relief?

437
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,182
I asked why you were here.

438
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:33,311
Is that difficult to answer,
First Lieutenant Yoon?

439
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:35,396
"Is that difficult to answer?"

440
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:37,732
If you crash her wedding your way

441
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:40,985
she'll probably be
relieved to have broken up with you.

442
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:45,614
But if you go with me,
we can make her regret it all night.

443
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:47,491
That's my answer.

444
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:49,618
It's tempting.

445
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:52,288
But I have a condition.

446
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,498
Turn the rear mirror around.

447
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:07,845
She's an expert at breaking up couples.

448
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:11,307
What was the condition?

449
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:14,518
This is where I came in.

450
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,859
The person my father sees as my husband is

451
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:23,903
coming in as a company commander.

452
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:27,448
He was my senior at the Academy.
Yoo Si-jin?

453
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:30,201
He already arrived.
He's been here two days.

454
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:31,786
He came fast.

455
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:42,338
Anyways, tell him you're dating me.

456
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:46,300
You don't like Yoo Si-jin?

457
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:49,053
-Why...
-He's not my type.

458
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,263
He looks like a girl.

459
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:54,392
-Cooperate?
-Cooperate.

460
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:56,519
I like your reason.

461
00:39:57,603 --> 00:39:59,355
Do you like my outfit?

462
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:01,524
I purposely wore a white dress.

463
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:06,695
If I let down my hair and wear heels,
I'm really pretty.

464
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,072
Prettier than the bride.

465
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:18,332
What do you think?

466
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:20,543
So the concept for today is...

467
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:21,919
You guessed it, right?

468
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:23,879
Is it a virgin ghost?

469
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:28,551
It's an angel.

470
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:35,391
Let's go.

471
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:47,903
The person her father approved of is you?

472
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:49,530
Yes.

473
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:52,158
Please wait here.

474
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:05,754
-Let's go.
-Wait a minute.

475
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:10,926
So Master Sergeant Seo, Myeong-ju,
and you were in a love triangle?

476
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:12,970
Yes. Hold my hand.

477
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:14,472
And it's still going on?

478
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,059
-Yes.
-What about your opinion?

479
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:23,564
Why are you curious about my opinion?

480
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,357
When was it that you dumped me...

481
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:32,490
I am just asking.

482
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:37,411
I am just asking.

483
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,497
I am not curious about your opinion.

484
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:46,504
Your earlier facial expression seems
very curious.

485
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:55,429
Sit.

486
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,895
Hold on tight. So you don't fly off.

487
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:38,907
This place is really extraordinary.

488
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:40,576
How could a place like this exist?

489
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:42,703
It's breathtaking.

490
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:46,248
Then come again.

491
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:57,885
People of Uruk believe that if they take
the pebbles from this beach,

492
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:00,971
they will definitely be able to come back.

493
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:04,767
Here.

494
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:10,481
You made that up, didn't you?

495
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:13,651
If that were true
all the pebbles would be gone.

496
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:19,490
The people who came back
must have put the pebbles back.

497
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:25,454
The legend is beautiful.

498
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:30,751
That ship is also very amazing.
I can go in there, right?

499
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:47,518
How come this ship is here like this?

500
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:50,062
Because it's enchanted.

501
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:53,107
If you are enchanted by a beauty,
you become like this.

502
00:44:57,695 --> 00:44:59,154
Have you ever been enchanted?

503
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:04,159
Of course, I have.

504
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:07,538
I think you know that.

505
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:26,056
Now that I think about it,
I still haven't heard your response.

506
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:30,394
Have you been well?

507
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:40,404
Are you still... sexy in the OR?

508
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:47,286
I think you misunderstood.

509
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:51,331
I didn't come here to do
volunteer work with good intentions.

510
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,795
One of my seniors
dragged me down a little bit.

511
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:59,548
The place he sent me to was here.

512
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:03,969
And I don't do surgeries anymore.

513
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:07,556
Surgery experience didn't lead to
a good career.

514
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:10,058
I will go back soon.

515
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:13,687
I'll have to go back to where I was
when I go back.

516
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:15,606
I am very busy.

517
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,276
I see.

518
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:50,557
Okay.

519
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:53,435
Here.

520
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:58,232
When you're somewhere like this,
you eat like this.

521
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:00,234
You will remember this taste forever.

522
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:09,660
It's finished. It tastes perfect.

523
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:11,578
Prepare your spoons.

524
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:14,373
-Dig in!
-Wait!

525
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:16,792
I'll take some out first.

526
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:20,504
You spoiled, military-exempt prince!

527
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:25,801
Taking the egg yolk
for yourself isn't right!

528
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:30,889
Did you just dig in with
the spoon you just ate with?

529
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:33,016
Seriously. I won't eat it.

530
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:38,605
We are doctors that need to keep
our health in check.

531
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:41,191
How could we share out of the same bowl
with spoons?

532
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:44,319
So I just starved instead.

533
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:46,488
Nothing else is hard,

534
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:48,532
but there's no warm water and--

535
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:49,783
You scared me!

536
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:52,995
Honey, I will call you back.

537
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:56,081
Hey, you...

538
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:01,962
Please give me something to eat.

539
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:05,591
I heard you guys give out things to eat.

540
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:08,427
I couldn't come yesterday.

541
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,390
Talk to me from there. From there.

542
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,236
Hey!

543
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:49,593
He vomited and suddenly fainted?

544
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:53,555
Yes, he was lacking in nutrients
so I gave him an IV bag.

545
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:56,058
His voice was normal.

546
00:48:56,975 --> 00:48:58,602
It doesn't seem like pneumonia.

547
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:02,898
Anemia from malnutrition doesn't explain

548
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:04,483
how serious this condition is.

549
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,280
Aches between the liver and stomach?

550
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:11,698
Lead poisoning?

551
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:15,369
Lead poisoning symptoms don't appear
this suddenly, though.

552
00:49:23,585 --> 00:49:25,504
Was he sucking on something?

553
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:28,799
Yes. He was sucking on his fingers
while he was talking to me.

554
00:49:30,008 --> 00:49:32,135
I don't know what he was asking me though.

555
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:35,681
That's dirty. It's dirty. Eat this.

556
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:39,559
-I want it too.
-Me too.

557
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:43,939
We'll start with detoxification.

558
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:47,526
Give him an IV with high potency vitamin C
as well as EDTA.

559
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:49,069
You think it's lead poisoning?

560
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:53,949
It's anemia caused by malnutrition,
but because lead was ingested,

561
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:57,411
the red blood cells absorbed the lead
since it wasn't receiving nutrients.

562
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:59,454
Since the lead intake increased
too quickly,

563
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:01,707
it became acute poisoning.

564
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:04,209
Captain is right.

565
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:06,128
I'll bring the medicine.

566
00:50:11,466 --> 00:50:12,884
Let me know when he wakes up.

567
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:14,886
I can help you communicate.

568
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:17,180
Thank you for helping out.

569
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:23,562
But from now on, let the medical team
take care of medical--

570
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:26,773
If you're thankful, then just be thankful.

571
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:30,652
-What do you mean?
-You said there is dignity in life.

572
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:32,571
No other value should take precedence.

573
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:37,784
I mean you seem too different from
the Dr. Kang I once knew.

574
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:43,623
Anemia from malnutrition
and symptoms of lead poisoning

575
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:45,751
are illnesses that rarely occur
in Korea now.

576
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:47,878
Here, they are as common as the cold.

577
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:53,258
Even if they are rare, it would be nice
if a doctor who knew came.

578
00:50:53,341 --> 00:50:54,718
Of course, that is true.

579
00:50:55,427 --> 00:51:00,223
However, not all doctors in this world are
like Schweitzer.

580
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:02,059
Of course.

581
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:04,811
There have to be TV doctors, too.

582
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:08,565
I'll leave first this time.

583
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:42,808
The entire area of Medi Cube is
under FPCON 2.

584
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:44,643
FPCON: FORCE PROTECTION CONDITION

585
00:52:09,334 --> 00:52:11,711
What's going on?
Is there a war going on somewhere?

586
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:15,465
If so, I'm going to treat the enemy too,
I took the Hippocratic Oath.

587
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:18,718
The medical team is needed.

588
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:24,975
Is it the Medi Cube field hospital?

589
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:28,103
A VIP patient is being transferred to
Medi Cube.

590
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:30,730
How much time do we have?

591
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:37,988
President Mubarak of the Arab League,

592
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:40,949
was returning from
his unofficial visit to North Uruk

593
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:43,869
to conclude the Middle Eastern
peace treaty.

594
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,080
He's a royal from Abu Dhabi
who is third in line to the throne,

595
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:51,585
he's known to be a key player
in leading political agreements

596
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:53,879
in religious conflicts
and border disputes.

597
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:57,257
He's a strong candidate for
the Nobel Peace Prize,

598
00:52:57,382 --> 00:53:00,302
but to his opposition,
he's their number one target.

599
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:05,807
Get the car ready.
I'm headed to the Blue House.

600
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:25,452
These are medical records
sent by the patient's doctor.

601
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:27,829
Okay.

602
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:36,004
What is this?

603
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:38,673
If everything is redacted,
what do they want us to see?

604
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:42,219
In VIP patient charts,
there are more lies than truth anyway.

605
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:45,430
They record false information
in their charts?

606
00:53:46,097 --> 00:53:47,724
What kind of doctors would do that?

607
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:49,643
Doctors like me.

608
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:54,105
Similar to how poor patients need
doctors like Schweitzer,

609
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:56,650
VIPs need special doctors, too.

610
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:59,986
To VIPs, their medical history can be
their weakness.

611
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:03,365
That's why a president's health is
a national secret.

612
00:54:17,295 --> 00:54:19,589
-What's the situation?
-Nothing special.

613
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:21,633
Emergency treatment is being performed.

614
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:25,345
Okay. Even the Blue House has been
briefed on this situation,

615
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:27,389
so keep me updated.

616
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:29,891
Got it.

617
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:33,895
Blood pressure is 175/110, pulse is 100,
and heart rate is 70.

618
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:38,775
Blood pressure is high, pulse is fast
and irregular, and he is drowsy.

619
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:40,235
It appears to be hypoglycemia.

620
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:43,947
His chart said diabetes.
Do you think it's a problem with insulin?

621
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:47,075
Let's take care of that first.
Please get a 50-DW IV.

622
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:48,034
Okay.

623
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:57,877
Nitroglycerin?

624
00:54:59,212 --> 00:55:00,755
A vasodilator? Why?

625
00:55:01,047 --> 00:55:03,341
A diabetic having
an adverse reaction to insulin?

626
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:05,093
The chart is not to be trusted.

627
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:07,220
Switch the diagnosis with the symptoms.

628
00:55:07,345 --> 00:55:09,097
Not hypertension from hypoglycemia.

629
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:11,057
It's hypoglycemia due to heart problems.

630
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:12,851
Please give this to him.

631
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:30,493
His blood pressure is suddenly dropping.

632
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:31,953
Open IV lines fully.

633
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:39,961
What's going on? Abdominal distension?

634
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:42,630
Hey, what's going on?

635
00:55:46,259 --> 00:55:47,510
What's the situation?

636
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:50,013
Abdominal distension
and a drop in blood pressure?

637
00:55:50,096 --> 00:55:51,181
Hemoperitoneum?

638
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:56,936
He is bleeding into his abdominal cavity.
There is something else he's hiding.

639
00:55:57,020 --> 00:56:00,482
I'll know once I open him up.
I'm going to do an open abdominal surgery.

640
00:56:00,565 --> 00:56:02,275
-Get the operating room ready.
-Okay.

641
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:55,912
Everyone, step away.

642
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:09,175
But as soon as I take my hands off,
he will die.

643
00:57:14,305 --> 00:57:16,307
His blood pressure is
dropping even further.

644
00:57:20,186 --> 00:57:23,398
Listen. The matter
is not whether he lives or dies.

645
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:26,401
The problem is who will take
responsibility for it.

646
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:28,945
Do what the Arabs want.

647
00:57:29,028 --> 00:57:31,406
So if the patient dies,
we blame it on the doctor

648
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:33,950
for making the mistake
of not operating on him.

649
00:57:35,201 --> 00:57:38,621
Our force will not intervene
under any circumstances.

650
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,331
This is an order.

651
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:55,638
Can you save this patient?

652
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:57,390
What?

653
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:01,186
I won't know until I open him up,

654
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:03,188
but he is bleeding in the biliary tree--

655
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:06,733
Enough with the complicated stuff.
Tell me if you can save him or not,

656
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:08,526
as a doctor.

657
00:58:12,405 --> 00:58:13,615
What are you doing?

658
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:14,949
Answer me.

659
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:29,506
I can save him.

660
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:40,475
Then save him.

661
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,270
There's about to be a war!

662
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:28,565
I'm going to kill you all for mutiny!

663
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:31,401
His blood pressure is dropping too much.
Too much bleeding.

664
00:59:31,484 --> 00:59:33,903
What do we do?
If something bad happens to him,

665
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:35,572
aren't we all going to die?

666
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:39,158
Dismiss Captain Yoo Si-jin of his duties
for disobeying orders, and...

667
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:40,702
prepare to apprehend him.

668
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:46,040
-Why did you do something that useless?
-Because of me, one person's life--

669
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:48,501
I haven't seen Captain Yoo around.
Where did he go?

670
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:51,254
He'll go to prison for disobeying orders.

671
00:59:51,337 --> 00:59:54,591
How could you not know?
You insisted on proceeding with surgery.

672
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:57,969
