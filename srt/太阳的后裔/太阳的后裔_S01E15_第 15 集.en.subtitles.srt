1
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:45,045
Didn't I look like
a beautiful painting just now?

2
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:47,547
You often do.

3
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,967
The discharge procedure is done.
You can go now.

4
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,052
Let's take the car.

5
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,345
Today I'll be your girlfriend,
not your doctor.

6
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:56,181
Wow, really?

7
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,641
I'm so excited. Let's go!

8
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,019
EPISODE 15

9
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:02,771
It's really nice weather.

10
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,899
Uruk's clouds were really pretty.

11
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:08,234
Should we go back again together?

12
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,152
Together?

13
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,404
You want to go with some other punk?

14
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,740
-That could be an option.
-Seriously...

15
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:16,076
What were you listening to?

16
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,621
It's my favorite. Do you want to listen?

17
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:35,929
I should've told him how I feel
if I knew I'd die like this.

18
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:39,140
-Hey!
-Oh! Whoa!

19
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:43,645
Dr. Kang! Wait!

20
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:48,024
Hey!

21
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:53,530
Are you okay? Oh no!

22
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,657
I'm fine, but only because it's me.

23
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,451
Oh, this is terrible.
It's quite expensive.

24
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,245
What should I do?

25
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:04,040
Were you asking
if the wheelchair was okay?

26
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:08,545
I nearly died 10 minutes after
being released from the hospital.

27
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,046
This is like attempted murder.

28
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,841
Why were you listening to that?

29
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,968
Oh! What do I do about the wheelchair?

30
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:18,096
This woman, seriously.
Now you're even breaking wheelchairs.

31
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:21,307
You know, let's not use
public transportation.

32
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:22,684
For everyone's safety.

33
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,644
Oh, like you did nothing wrong?

34
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,248
Say what you need to say.
I'm leaving after I finish eating.

35
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,084
-I'm almost done.
-I have nothing to say.

36
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:56,342
-Then why ask me to eat with you?
-Because you got too skinny. 

37
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:04,809
I'm confused, what are we?

38
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,021
Did we break up, or did we fight?

39
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:09,606
What are we?

40
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,651
Are we going to break up,
are we still fighting,

41
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:15,320
or did we break up?

42
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:19,115
I'm in the process getting over you.

43
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,700
So, you're still doing it.

44
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,702
Please let me give up.

45
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:25,496
After leaving the military,
you'll go work for my family's company

46
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,041
and live as my father's son-in-law?
You'll endure that?

47
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:30,168
-But you'll be next to me.
-Yeah.

48
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:32,170
You look like you're dying of happiness.

49
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:36,966
I'll get out. I won't see my father.

50
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:41,304
My father has his own life
and I have mine.

51
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:44,015
-I can live without seeing him.
-Is that all you can say?

52
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:49,687
You'll be promoted to major, lieutenant
colonel, and then colonel. And perhaps...

53
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:52,732
No, since it's you,
you'll definitely get a star.

54
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:55,026
The capable and gutsy military surgeon!

55
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:57,445
I would also oppose.

56
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:05,119
I know what you're saying,
but I despise you.

57
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,455
Do you think you're endearing?

58
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:10,500
You're done, right?
I really just came to feed you.

59
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,043
I'll be going.

60
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,799
Next time,
answer me instead of feeding me.

61
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,801
Tell me whether we are breaking up or not.

62
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:30,144
MILITARY DISCHARGE APPLICATION

63
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:46,703
BIG BOSS

64
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:47,662
What are you doing?

65
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,248
Going to freshen up.

66
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:55,461
Did you miss me already?

67
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:59,007
-You said you were freshening up.
-And?

68
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,883
But you're still dressed.

69
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:03,928
Is that why you did a video call?

70
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,513
Not because you missed me?

71
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:07,598
I want to see you. In many ways.

72
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:11,519
Pervert... I'm going to get undressed
after we hang up, so hang up!

73
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:23,656
Why did you lie? You said you were
getting undressed.

74
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:25,450
You're asking for trouble!

75
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,745
Why are you here?
Are you already done with work?

76
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,288
I took some sick leave.

77
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:33,333
I need a checkup,
because my injuries hurt so much.

78
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,044
Then you should have gone to the hospital.

79
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,463
I have to see my doctor
to get a medical report.

80
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,799
What is all this when you're in pain?

81
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,010
Pain relief.

82
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,139
Oh, before I get a medical report,
let me watch you take a bath.

83
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:50,892
-Don't even dream it.
-It's my dream, so it's up to me.

84
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:54,437
I'll wait, go wash up.

85
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:57,982
Why do you keep telling me to wash up?
It's my body, it's up to me.

86
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,401
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

87
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,862
Don't start without me,
I know how many there are.

88
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:11,704
Whoa. What is this?

89
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,375
It's a present.
So you're beautiful from any angle.

90
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:19,045
You really are very beautiful.

91
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:20,838
Huh! I guess you didn't know.

92
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,966
-How did you know which ones I like?
-I remembered.

93
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,343
After seeing it only once?

94
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:27,720
Do you think I only came here once?

95
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,764
-No.
-How many times?

96
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:31,808
Why? I'm not curious.

97
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,811
Will you put that down?

98
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,855
Ah! I remember! The day I got drunk.

99
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,399
-When?
-A long time ago.

100
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,362
Don't even think about drinking
with some other punk!

101
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:46,697
What if I do?
Will you fly in on a helicopter?

102
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,199
You think I can't?

103
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:53,621
Oh, that's right. The day you came
to rescue me from Private Ryan's house,

104
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:56,499
why did an Arab helicopter come?

105
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,046
Ah, I hurt this arm when I fell over...

106
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:05,967
-You didn't fall on that side.
-Exactly. I fell on this side.

107
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,972
Tell me the truth. I won't get mad.

108
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:14,934
-You promise?
-Tell me you didn't use the business card.

109
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,688
Shall we make a toast?

110
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,857
You used it again? On that helicopter?

111
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:25,611
Are you forgetting
that you only lived because I did?

112
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,573
Who cares if I live or die
if I don't have the business card?

113
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:31,242
Tell me honestly.
Was there anything in the helicopter?

114
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:34,495
Like the deed to an oil factory or...
No. Cash is okay, too.

115
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,622
Bonds are also very useful!

116
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,584
Think carefully. Was there something
like a 007 black briefcase?

117
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:42,920
Ah, I'm so thirsty.
Where's the water? Where is it?

118
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,505
Stop right there.

119
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:48,759
Really. How could you use it
on transportation again?

120
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,887
It's not like it's a travel card!

121
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,181
What are you going to do
about my business card?

122
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,892
Oh, so materialistic.

123
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:58,936
Hey!

124
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:01,772
2015 GED TEST CENTER

125
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,816
-Just do your best.
-I'll do my best, Dad.

126
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,443
I believe in you, my daughter!

127
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:06,944
Good luck!

128
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,365
Gi-beom!

129
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:12,575
GOODLUCK, GI-BEOM!

130
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,202
What are you doing here?

131
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,746
Did you come to cheer me on?

132
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:21,667
Personally? In person? How dare to?
Wait, maybe "dare to" is wrong.

133
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:25,129
"Dare to"? It's "daring". How daring!

134
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,882
Sergeant Gong, is he going to pass?

135
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:30,092
Where there's a will, there's a way.

136
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,178
Taffy! Make sure you pass!

137
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:34,096
Pick the right answers!

138
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:38,601
Eat well, get your strength up,
pick your answers carefully, and pass!

139
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:45,316
When in doubt, always pick "C".
Do your best, okay?

140
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:47,777
Private Kim Gi-beom!

141
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:51,197
I joined the army, a GED is nothing
compared to that.

142
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:56,118
I will definitely return triumphantly!
Solidarity!

143
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,120
That's right. Good luck.

144
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,747
-Fight!
-You can do it, Gi-beom!

145
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:02,542
-When in doubt, I'll pick "C".
-Good luck!

146
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,214
People are staring at us.

147
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,509
Act like a civilian.
Just like a normal civilian.

148
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:15,888
Ah, seriously. Don't do that.

149
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,560
Can't you just wear normal clothes--

150
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,485
Solidarity!

151
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,576
Alpha Team, it's a combined operation.

152
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:41,080
Get your winter military gear and
be at airport 436 by 21:00 today.

153
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,215
Deputy Team Leader,
the Commander is asking for you.

154
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:55,136
It's a three-month long mission.

155
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:58,723
Because there's no one to replace you yet,

156
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:02,018
I'm thinking about sending you.

157
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:08,524
If it's not okay with you. I can sign
your discharge request right now.

158
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,151
What should we do?

159
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:12,862
I want to go.

160
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:17,158
Good. Go then and come back.

161
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,786
Due to the special circumstances
needed for the Alpha Team,

162
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,998
I'll process your discharge
after your position has been filled.

163
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,583
Let's settle it this way.

164
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,878
I don't know when
your replacement will be determined.

165
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:33,341
I apologize, but what you're saying is...

166
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:36,844
When you return, come with Myeong-ju.
We will have a cup...

167
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:41,557
No, make that two, cups of tea.

168
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,435
-Commander...
-Departure is 21:00. Don't be late.

169
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,480
Come back healthy and safely.

170
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:54,070
Sergeant First Class Seo Dae-yeong
will return safely.

171
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,698
-Solidarity.
-Solidarity.

172
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,496
DISCHARGE REQUEST FORM

173
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,162
What is it?

174
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,039
Chwadi means goat in the local dialect.

175
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:50,042
What is it with you? You always change
topics without warning!

176
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,044
What about a goat?

177
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:55,631
The topic is... I am friends
with Daniel on social media.

178
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:59,051
The information is... I wrote,
"Hi, Chwadi. I hope you're doing well."

179
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,637
and Daniel told me "chwadi" means goat.

180
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:06,100
So Chwadi wasn't Blakey's name.

181
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:08,144
You still haven't found out his name?

182
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:11,355
The conclusion is... clench your teeth.

183
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:16,652
-Clench your teeth.
-It was always chwadi this, chwadi that...

184
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:17,570
Hello?

185
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:23,284
We still have two and half hours
till our date.

186
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:25,119
You're here early just like last time.

187
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:31,167
What is it?

188
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,795
I guess you aren't here early.

189
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,047
No.

190
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,049
The department store again?

191
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:40,843
Yes.

192
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:44,972
This time I'll be gone a while longer.

193
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:50,436
I didn't think I'd have any time,
but I wanted to see you before I left.

194
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:54,690
How long is long? A week? Two weeks?

195
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,318
Three months.

196
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:02,573
Three months? Is it an overseas store?

197
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,827
Pretend I'm enlisting in the army.

198
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:10,331
They usually grant a leave after 100 days.

199
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,878
You're going to make me wait
for your return?

200
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,838
Don't drink with another guy.

201
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:28,933
I'm sorry. I was trying not to,
but it isn't working.

202
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:38,067
I'm sorry for making you have to try.

203
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,319
Come back quickly then.

204
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:43,489
Don't get hurt. Don't be late.

205
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:48,160
I won't get hurt. I won't die.

206
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:53,958
I promise I'll be back.

207
00:13:58,212 --> 00:13:59,755
Can you keep in touch?

208
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,718
I'm going to a place
where international data doesn't work.

209
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:08,597
I'll be sure to call you whenever I can.

210
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:13,269
Just enjoy this season

211
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:18,566
and I'll be sure to return
when the seasons change.

212
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:23,904
Then...

213
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:28,701
Already? Wait.

214
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,379
I'll miss you.

215
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:43,716
Me too.

216
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:59,375
Dr. Kang. Dr. Kang!

217
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,461
Dr. Kang!

218
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,588
Oh, what is it?

219
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:07,257
Are you okay?
You've been out of it all day.

220
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,550
You're worrying me.

221
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,766
I arrived safely.

222
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,811
I really miss you.

223
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:24,817
I'm on my way to work.

224
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:28,362
The sky in Korea is beautiful today.
How is it over there?

225
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:31,198
Is it cold there or is it a warm country?

226
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:35,661
Wherever you are, I really, really,
really miss you.

227
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:39,039
They're playing the national anthem on TV.

228
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:43,585
Why is the national anthem
the theme song of my love life?

229
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,922
Koreans should stay as Koreans.

230
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:51,093
Come back quickly! I miss you!

231
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:56,640
Work was so busy,
I'm just eating lunch now.

232
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:59,309
It's already winter here.

233
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:03,397
You said you'd be back in a season.
Why aren't you back yet?

234
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:07,067
Not hearing from you makes me sad...

235
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:27,546
It would be nice
if you were coming back on that.

236
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:41,769
Go back first!
I'll take the next helicopter with Wolf!

237
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:42,936
Yes, sir!

238
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:45,606
Go! Go!

239
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,360
Big Boss transmitting.

240
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:54,114
The helicopter transporting
three civilians just departed.

241
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:58,118
-Only 10 more minutes and we go home.
-Yes, sir.

242
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:03,540
Captain!

243
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,710
Captain!

244
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:10,839
Captain!

245
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:14,927
Captain!

246
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,769
No...

247
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,356
Hurry up, get on. Let's go home!

248
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:17,114
We have to go home and drink together!

249
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,117
Yes.

250
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:30,878
I will go.

251
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:34,923
What are you saying? Stay alert, sir!

252
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,592
You can't fall asleep.

253
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,886
Look at me, Captain!

254
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,139
You can't fall asleep, Captain Yoo!

255
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:53,901
Big Boss, Wolf, do you hear me?

256
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,153
What is the situation?

257
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,447
Anyone, please respond!

258
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:03,994
No!

259
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:06,788
Captain!

260
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,457
Wait!

261
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:09,750
Captain!

262
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,501
Captain!

263
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:12,878
No!

264
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,566
This is too much.

265
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:38,237
Even a letter to Mars would have
arrived by now!

266
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,531
I will be drinking
with a really handsome man.

267
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,659
You should come and get me.

268
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,336
If he hasn't seen the message,

269
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:57,005
then he's likely somewhere
he can't receive it.

270
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:00,050
Why send a message every day
and then get upset?

271
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:04,179
So he feels guilty
when he sees I wrote every day.

272
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:06,473
Will it be like this every mission?

273
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:08,934
Whether it is or not, I still get ignored

274
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,478
since we were apart and not dating.

275
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,648
Did you make-up before he left?

276
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:17,943
There's no making up.

277
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:20,445
This is not just a lover's quarrel,
it's a war.

278
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,364
A war I can't lose.

279
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:27,327
Seeing that he left his dog tags,
I think I'm at a slight advantage.

280
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,162
Cheers.

281
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:34,918
Let him come back.
Be it work or whatever, I will quit

282
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,753
and stick to him for a whole week.

283
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:39,339
I will confiscate his phone
and go on a vacation.

284
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:40,882
I'll make advance reservations.

285
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,593
We'll go on vacation somewhere far
and fight it out.

286
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:52,394
-Whoa!
-Did he text back?

287
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:56,315
Corporal Kim won a soccer game.
I'm on a military forum for girlfriends.

288
00:21:57,357 --> 00:22:01,778
Congratulations, Hye-kyeong.

289
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:03,864
I'm going crazy.

290
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:08,452
Just pour me a drink, Mo-yeon.

291
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:11,621
You really have a high tolerance
for alcohol.

292
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:17,919
It's raining.

293
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,256
It has been since this morning.

294
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:29,723
It'd be nice if they were here already.

295
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:34,519
It's about time for them to return.

296
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:39,107
Right? They should be back soon.

297
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,465
Attention!

298
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,551
Salute the Commander.

299
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:09,137
Solidarity!

300
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,227
At ease.

301
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:19,147
Joint operation mission
has been completed.

302
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:21,066
The bodies...

303
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,988
haven't been found.

304
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,503
Sergeant Kim Bum-rae.

305
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:06,713
Yes? What is it?

306
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:10,467
Sergeant Kim Bum-rae.

307
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:11,968
Spit it out, what is it?

308
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:17,182
Sergeant First Class Seo came back,
didn't he?

309
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,476
I will be right there.

310
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:22,729
Tell him to wait.

311
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:27,651
Sergeant Kim Bum-rae.

312
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:31,821
I will be reporting.

313
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:37,577
Staff Sergeant Choi? Hello.

314
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:40,288
I thought it was Captain Yoo in the jeep.

315
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:42,666
What brings you here?

316
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,507
I am really...

317
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,136
sorry.

318
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:57,931
What for?

319
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:02,519
Special Forces Captain Yoo Si-jin,

320
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:07,148
Sergeant First Class Seo Dae-yeong...

321
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:09,859
During the tactical attack,

322
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:14,489
they passed away.

323
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,326
What?

324
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,829
How could you report such a thing?

325
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:27,794
I... don't understand
a single thing about this.

326
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:29,796
What should I do?

327
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:35,969
Aren't you going to report properly?

328
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:40,098
Do as you usually do.

329
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:44,561
Say it again.

330
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,566
I said, say it again!

331
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:15,300
Before we go on a mission,
we write a will.

332
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:21,139
I hope that this letter
will never be given to you.

333
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:26,686
But if, by a rare chance,
you are reading this will right now,

334
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:29,814
then I have not been able
to keep my promise.

335
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,860
The promise to not worry you,

336
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:36,571
the promise not to get hurt,

337
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,115
the promise not to die,

338
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:42,619
the promise that I would return...

339
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:45,789
I haven't kept any of those.

340
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:48,625
I'm sorry.

341
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:54,798
Wherever you are always seems so bright.

342
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,721
I met you.

343
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:05,100
And I loved you.

344
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:08,812
And as for being apart from you,

345
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:11,731
I'm really sorry for that.

346
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,678
It's not true, right?

347
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,391
It's not true.

348
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,020
It's not true.

349
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:52,647
I'm sorry.

350
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:54,691
Dad, please.

351
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:58,737
Please.

352
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:04,159
You need to say it isn't true.
It's not true.

353
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:17,630
Seo Dae-yeong...
wanted to give this to you.

354
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:23,344
Don't. I don't want it.

355
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:27,932
I won't accept this.

356
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:33,897
If I read this... if I accept this...

357
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:38,318
then he's really dead.

358
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:46,242
This is all your fault.

359
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:50,038
You took all the time away
that we could've been happy.

360
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:54,292
I wasn't able to make up with him.

361
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:57,003
I just said those harsh words
and sent him away.

362
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:02,509
This is an honorable soldier's last words.

363
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:05,970
Keep it fondly.

364
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,390
I don't want to.

365
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:12,644
I said I don't want to.

366
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,881
Why are you here like this?

367
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:44,759
Why are you crying?

368
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:48,555
What should I do if you're like this?

369
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:53,643
I can't ask anything.

370
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,729
Seeing you was my last hope...

371
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:59,482
but what should I do if you are like this?

372
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:04,696
Didn't you say
your father is high up in the army?

373
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:06,489
Did you check everything?

374
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:07,907
They could have been wrong!

375
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:10,034
They might have made a mistake!

376
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,328
Are you crying because you checked?

377
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:17,125
Stop crying and answer me, Yoon Myeong-ju.

378
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:30,930
For real?

379
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,770
He really isn't coming?

380
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:42,692
I really won't see him?

381
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:46,613
Seriously?

382
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:48,948
He isn't coming?

383
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:38,665
I know it is shameless,

384
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:41,542
but I don't want you crying for too long.

385
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:45,004
More than anyone else,

386
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:47,548
you have to have a good life and be happy.

387
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:49,592
And...

388
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:53,346
forget me after a while.

389
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:56,808
Please.

390
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:08,736
There will be an official announcement
in the army a week from now.

391
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,992
The death of Captain Yoo Si-jin
and Sergeant First Class Seo Dae-yeong

392
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:18,037
will be covered up as a car accident
during training.

393
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,171
For safety regulation issues,

394
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:30,550
you must sign
the confidentiality agreement.

395
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:33,177
I ask for your cooperation.

396
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,311
Did his death

397
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:46,774
save someone's life?

398
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,569
Yes, it did.

399
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:57,577
Did his death...

400
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,832
protect the peace of somewhere?

401
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:07,754
Yes, it did.

402
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:10,757
Was his death...

403
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,552
for our country?

404
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:16,763
Yes.

405
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:19,807
It was.

406
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:22,101
And yet, his country...

407
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:28,149
makes me sign this document.

408
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:32,236
I am sorry.

409
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,201
Why is this so messed up?

410
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:42,080
Why did you choose

411
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:45,374
this kind of life right to the end?

412
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:49,796
Even your death has to be a secret
due to regulations.

413
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:56,427
I hope that what I am doing now is...

414
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,600
what you want,

415
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:05,311
Yoo Si-jin.

416
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:19,552
I heard you've got your title back.

417
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:21,345
Very admirable, huh?

418
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:26,058
As a friend, I congratulate you
for being promoted so fast.

419
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:31,272
I heard you're opposed to using
Cosmo Pharmaceuticals.

420
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:34,275
The medicine we use now is cheap and good.
Why use a more expensive one?

421
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:36,360
Please just change it.

422
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:39,363
The director is Dr. Park's cousin,
and he's an in-law.

423
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:41,073
He's your aunt's husband.

424
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:42,992
Everyone will be happy if you change it.

425
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:45,661
I heard you will be
submitting a clinical report.

426
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:48,122
Why are you being yelled at
for doing all the work?

427
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,916
-Who's yelling?
-Me.

428
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:51,626
Are you paying for the medicine?

429
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:54,879
If you really want to be Schweitzer,
then volunteer in a remote area.

430
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:57,840
In Africa, they don't have doctors,
people die every minute.

431
00:36:57,924 --> 00:37:00,134
Hurry up if you want to save the world.

432
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:04,222
I heard your office has no skilled doctor,
so 75% of patients are misdiagnosed.

433
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:07,642
You should get a lawyer if you want
to protect your medical license.

434
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:08,559
Hey!

435
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:12,605
Leave so I can eat my lunch in peace.

436
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:14,649
Cheers.

437
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:21,155
It is good.

438
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:23,783
Drink slowly.

439
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:25,701
Why? When it is so good.

440
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:28,037
Go home today.

441
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:31,290
You've been here for days.
The interns are having a hard time.

442
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:33,334
Did they say it's because of me?

443
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,628
I didn't think of that.

444
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:39,882
-I have a surgery in the morning.
-Stop going into the OR.

445
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,511
I'm at my sexiest in the operating room.

446
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,270
What?

447
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:55,982
Nothing. I just thought of something.

448
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:57,400
What did you think of?

449
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:04,031
Just this and that.

450
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:08,577
Water.

451
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:10,413
Wine.

452
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:12,873
Candle.

453
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:15,710
X-ray photo.

454
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:17,837
Hair ties.

455
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,633
I'm crazy.

456
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,762
What is this? Why did you laugh?
Did you really go crazy?

457
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:29,724
I thought I was better, but...

458
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:34,228
I think I am really going crazy, Ji-soo.

459
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:41,652
Should I give you a hug?

460
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:44,655
No.

461
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:46,449
Should I give you alcohol?

462
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:48,492
Yeah.

463
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:55,249
Drink it all.

464
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:13,517
I report, sir!
First Lieutenant Yoon Myeong-ju,

465
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:15,144
as of November 31, 2015,

466
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:18,147
has received an order to go to
the Taebaek Medical Unit in Uruk.

467
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:20,775
This is my report. Solidarity.

468
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,072
Come back safely.

469
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:28,074
Don't get sick this time.

470
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:29,742
I am sorry for making you worry.

471
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:33,704
-You, too, don't get ill, Dad.
-Okay.

472
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:36,540
Thank you for giving me
this transfer order fairly.

473
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:38,125
The only order that was unfair

474
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:40,961
was his.

475
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,714
Because of that,
my daughter's been in agony,

476
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:46,175
and it was a tactical failure.

477
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:50,304
I know you only think about that punk,

478
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,767
but I think about you.

479
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:58,354
In between thinking about him,

480
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:00,898
think of the father
who thinks of his daughter.

481
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:04,777
If you can forgive me,

482
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:07,530
then please do.

483
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,878
Why are we here
at a bar in broad daylight?

484
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:27,508
I am trying to get used to
the time difference for Uruk.

485
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,262
I'm being deployed again.

486
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:36,267
-You're lucky to return to Uruk.
-Want to join me?

487
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:37,935
Should we?

488
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:41,981
Those guys are going together,
so why can't we go together?

489
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:44,275
You don't make any sense.

490
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,907
This is a parting gift.

491
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:54,368
It was in the bunkhouse so I grabbed it.

492
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:58,831
This is
Sergeant First Class Seo's girlfriend.

493
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:02,960
That's Captain Yoo's comrade.

494
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:09,592
She's pretty short.

495
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:12,636
First Lieutenant Yoon,
you've got her beat.

496
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:16,182
When are you leaving?

497
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:18,601
I depart on Monday at dawn.

498
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:21,479
I have three days left,

499
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:23,481
should we just drink till then?

500
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:26,692
-What do you say?
-Yes, I will.

501
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:43,918
Strangely, I've been thinking
about nothing but the good times we had.

502
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:46,003
I think about the things he didn't do.

503
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:49,882
By the way,

504
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:51,967
I would like to know how Captain Yoo
and Sergeant First Class Seo met.

505
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:58,516
I was curious how they became so close,
but I didn't get a chance to ask.

506
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,976
And now I have nobody to ask.

507
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,186
I know the answer.

508
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:06,649
They first met because of a woman.

509
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:10,402
A woman?

510
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:18,410
I don't know.

511
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,580
Well, I feel a little strange.

512
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:25,626
Since I did my part,

513
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:28,712
don't forget to tell First Lieutenant Yoo
that we're dating.

514
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:01,954
I am the commander here.

515
00:43:02,037 --> 00:43:03,914
Why don't we share the umbrella?

516
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:05,499
We are dating.

517
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,003
You mean us?

518
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:14,091
I am dating
First Lieutenant Yoon Myeong-ju.

519
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:23,058
I'm dating
First Lieutenant Yoon Myeong-ju.

520
00:43:24,226 --> 00:43:26,353
How long have you two been dating?

521
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:27,438
For a year now.

522
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,984
When did you first meet Myeong-ju?

523
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:33,819
I first met her a month ago.

524
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:37,990
But you've been together for a year?

525
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,493
I would like to make it clear

526
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:44,330
that I am dating
First Lieutenant Yoon Myeong-ju.

527
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:48,375
Do you know that Myeong-ju's father
has three stars?

528
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:55,841
I think that anyone can make
up to three mistakes in their life.

529
00:43:56,634 --> 00:44:00,179
Her father's status
wouldn't be an obstacle for our love.

530
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:02,723
I will tell you this again.

531
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:05,184
I'm dating
First Lieutenant Yoon Myeong-ju.

532
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:08,687
I hope you're dating.

533
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:10,189
I definitely date her.

534
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:13,692
It's been a year, now.

535
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:15,778
Yeah, I know. I envy you.

536
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:19,698
Are you giving up?

537
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:25,954
Wouldn't someone I've known a month,
but dated a year, show up for me too?

538
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:30,626
I don't think we will be fighting
over Myeong-ju.

539
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:36,799
Let's be on the same side
when we do fight.

540
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:48,268
It feels good to drink during the day.

541
00:44:55,984 --> 00:44:59,655
You know, we've never said
"I love you" to each other.

542
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:01,573
We said it with our bodies instead.

543
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:07,705
We held hands and even kissed
before saying "I love you" to one another.

544
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:09,790
Wow, that's amazing. How daring.

545
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,291
Is that all you have to say?

546
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:12,876
There's something I couldn't say.

547
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:15,003
Let's say the something we couldn't say.

548
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:18,966
Let's be fair and go alphabetically.
Your name is Kang, so you go first.

549
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:20,759
You're the one who wants to hear it.

550
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:22,970
Nope. It's ladies first.

551
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:24,596
Or by age?

552
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:28,183
Why should I,
you didn't say it yet either.

553
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:30,060
-I love you.
-Oh, you startled me.

554
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:33,105
I love you.

555
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:36,525
Roger that.

556
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:39,987
I love you, too.

557
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:42,906
I will be loyal to you
with all that I have.

558
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:44,616
Okay.

559
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:47,536
-Do you pledge to the flag?
-Yes.

560
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:50,664
Solidarity.

561
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:53,584
Do I just do this?

562
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:55,878
Yes, but it's a little too erotic.

563
00:45:57,421 --> 00:46:00,007
Ah, this lady! It's still early, you know.

564
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:19,693
What do you think of me?

565
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,113
Am I pretty in the candlelight?

566
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,417
You are pretty every single moment.

567
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:58,106
I really missed you.

568
00:46:58,732 --> 00:46:59,566
Me too.

569
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,071
How come you didn't come?

570
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:06,365
Because I was protecting peace.

571
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:09,535
What about your promises?

572
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:14,206
Didn't they mean anything to you at all?

573
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:15,791
I was trying to come

574
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:20,087
with all my might.

575
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:25,259
I was going to come to you.

576
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:28,595
But you didn't come.

577
00:47:32,474 --> 00:47:33,725
You didn't come.

578
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,508
I am not going to read it.

579
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:51,637
I am never going to read it.

580
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,391
You should feel aggravated, too.

581
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:02,314
I just checked my bags.
I'm on my way in.

582
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:08,737
No. I will be getting to Albania
through Abu Dhabi.

583
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:11,615
It will be a very long journey.

584
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:13,533
Doctor Pyo, I am getting a call.

585
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:16,703
I will give you a call once I get there.

586
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:18,830
Hello?

587
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:22,084
Daniel?

588
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:25,587
When did you get here?

589
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:28,757
What are you doing here anyway?
What is this thing here?

590
00:49:29,257 --> 00:49:31,802
I am here to do a protest,

591
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:34,012
but I am prohibited
from entering the country.

592
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:35,889
They said I can't cross this line.

593
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:38,183
I was going to camp here
and protest by myself.

594
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:40,686
You are so cool.

595
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:44,064
An international criminal
banned from 12 different countries?

596
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:46,566
Bad men are what women fantasize about.

597
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:48,819
Are you on vacation?

598
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:50,028
I will be volunteering.

599
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:52,739
You mean
for the Albanian refugee camp?

600
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,950
Dr. Chi-hoon left a message.

601
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:57,619
Volunteering can be quite addictive.

602
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:01,456
It's not for that impressive reason.
I have an ulterior motive.

603
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:05,544
Tomorrow is the anniversary of his death,
so I'm going there so I don't forget.

604
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:47,461
I met Daniel at the airport.

605
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:49,046
It was nice.

606
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:52,299
I'm blood type O.

607
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:56,428
I just suddenly thought of that,
in case you thought I really was a doll.

608
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:00,974
They said there's a desert here somewhere.

609
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:03,602
Do you think there's an oasis as well?

610
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:06,897
You can't obtain a patent for the sun.

611
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:09,775
The words of Dr. Salk,
who created the polio vaccine.

612
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:13,153
You've been demanding the withdrawal
of patents for vaccines.

613
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:16,615
Don't you think patent protection
is necessary to develop new medication?

614
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:19,951
Pharmaceutical companies'
income is mostly used for marketing.

615
00:51:20,368 --> 00:51:23,580
If they're weaponizing vaccines
for  epidemics to make money,

616
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:26,249
then they are no different
than narcotic drug rings.

617
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:30,796
Life is more important than profits.

618
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:34,841
I've realized that there is no profit
worth more than life.

619
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,097
This is the kind of doctor I've become.

620
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:44,434
Do I seem worthy of praise
from where you are?

621
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:51,942
I'll watch it over the next week,
so try not to use your wrist, if possible.

622
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:54,361
Yes, I understand.

623
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:59,199
Commanding officer, don't make him work.

624
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:04,955
Yes, I understand.

625
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:09,876
Aren't you going to eat?

626
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,087
I make a killer ramen.

627
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:18,718
Why did you come all the way here?

628
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:20,428
Sergeant Kim Gi-beom.

629
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:23,306
The army suits me.

630
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:30,814
Sergeant First Class Seo
ate a lot of ramen, too, right?

631
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:34,568
Yes, he enjoyed it frequently.

632
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:39,281
Let's eat. It's good.

633
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:45,120
You know what?

634
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:47,664
It's snowing outside.

635
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:51,459
-Really?
-Wow, it's amazing.

636
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:53,879
It doesn't usually snow in Uruk.

637
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:47,098
I can do it myself.

638
00:53:49,851 --> 00:53:53,730
When you're dating, things that you can do
yourself can be done by the other person.

639
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:33,353
You always put your life on the line
like this, don't you?

640
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:36,773
I'm a man who is good at his job.

641
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:41,361
And part of my job is not getting killed.

642
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:47,367
Liar.

643
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:53,415
I won't get hurt. I won't die.

644
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:58,878
I'll be sure to come back. I promise.

645
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:07,971
Where do you get off lying?

646
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:11,641
I love you.

647
00:55:13,768 --> 00:55:15,103
Yeah, right.

648
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:17,647
I don't believe you.

649
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:09,282
Stay right here.

650
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:12,994
Big Boss transmitting.

651
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:39,854
I keep hearing ridiculous things lately.

652
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:46,444
MESSAGE READ

653
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,699
Big Boss transmitting.

654
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:17,475
Turn around, beautiful. Over.

655
00:57:43,668 --> 00:57:45,086
This can't be.

656
00:57:55,513 --> 00:57:56,764
This can't be.

657
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:00,393
This can't be.

658
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,265
It's been a really long time.

659
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:44,604
You...

660
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:48,816
You were alive?

661
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:55,573
I keep achieving that difficult mission.

662
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:09,379
You were alive.

663
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:13,550
You were alive.

664
00:59:16,177 --> 00:59:17,345
I'm sorry.

665
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:21,849
I'm sorry.

666
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:13,651
