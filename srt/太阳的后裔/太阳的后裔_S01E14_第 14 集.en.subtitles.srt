00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:27,694
EPISODE 14

2
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:29,988
He's had two liters of saline,
his BP is 80/50.

3
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:32,615
-There are multiple gunshot wounds.
-Gunshot wounds?

4
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:37,912
Please page more doctors.

5
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:40,248
I already received the call.
Go take that patient.

6
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,835
How's the patient?

7
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:16,409
Yoo Si-jin... Look at me.

8
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:17,535
Please look at me!

9
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:19,704
Can you hear my voice?

10
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,665
Why did you come to me like this?

11
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:25,001
Please, wake up!

12
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:40,183
Senior Lieutenant An Jeong-joon,
what are you doing here?

13
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:44,354
I don't trust my own,
 so I came all this way to see my friend.

14
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:49,317
Please... send me back up North.

15
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,904
Not to the South for asylum but North?

16
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:35,446
Bravo, 5-27 section.

17
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,074
Combat shooting in progress!
We need backup! Backup!

18
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,993
The target seems to be
Senior Lieutenant An!

19
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:44,122
Let go!

20
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,360
It's a cardiac arrest!

21
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:18,281
One hundred and fifty joules.
Charge. Clear. Shoot.

22
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,369
Two hundred joules. Charge. Shoot.

23
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:30,335
His vitals are not coming back up...

24
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:35,673
One, two, three... One, two, three...

25
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,092
Please come back!

26
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:41,679
Please come back. Please!

27
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,068
Do you have any ammo left?

28
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,654
One shot in the chamber.
I'll stop the car.

29
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:02,700
Ten meters, five meters... Now!

30
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,296
Don't do this...

31
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:01,009
How can this be happening to you. Please!

32
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:05,763
I said wake up, you bastard!

33
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:15,398
That hurts a lot.

34
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,942
His pulse... came back.

35
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,946
Yoo Si-jin, are you conscious?

36
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,489
Do you know where you are?

37
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:27,160
Can you see me? Can you hear my voice?

38
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,912
Where's Senior Lieutenant An?

39
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:31,998
What?

40
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:36,794
The patient who came
with me that was shot...

41
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:40,757
Is he alive...?

42
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:45,094
Who is that? Who is he?

43
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,597
Why are you worrying about someone else?

44
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,058
You just almost died!

45
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:54,228
One more minute
and I couldn't have revived you!

46
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:59,192
You look so pretty right now.

47
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,110
You bastard!

48
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:10,078
The one who was shot
and came in with me...

49
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,788
Why are you getting up?

50
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:13,081
Who is he?

51
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:15,541
Did you get in a fight with him?

52
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,418
Did he do this to you?

53
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:22,840
No... He's a friend.
He's not-close a friend, but...

54
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:24,509
Where is he?

55
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:31,432
The patient that arrived with the Captain
is wreaking havoc!

56
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:40,858
Don't come any closer.

57
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,653
If you lay a finger on me,
I'll kill everyone.

58
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:46,697
If I don't take care of you now,
you'll be the first to die.

59
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,492
You've already bled too much.

60
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,536
Shut your mouth.

61
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,873
We'll put down the gun,

62
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,835
and have the doctor treat you first.

63
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:01,212
How can I trust South Korean doctors?

64
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,966
Is there a guarantee
I'll survive in the operating room?

65
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:07,760
Be worried about what's going on out there
not in here.

66
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:11,931
Whether it's the South or the North,
whichever side you're on,

67
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,434
only a doctor can save you.

68
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,269
I don't need it.

69
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,063
Don't move!

70
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,572
-It's hypovolemic shock.
-Dr. Song is waiting for him.

71
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,031
We'll bring him up now.

72
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,702
Let me make a request.

73
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,498
I'd like for you to operate on him.

74
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:40,793
Listen, everyone.

75
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,629
After he takes a whole-body X-ray,
tie him to his bed.

76
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,756
If anything's broken, put a cast on it.

77
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,675
If he disobeys, beat him.

78
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:54,474
Fortunately, there is no pressure
on the heart.

79
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,309
His heart sounds normal as well.

80
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,480
Scalpel, please.

81
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:14,869
What is that? It isn't a gunshot wound.

82
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:16,913
There is something inside.

83
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,333
Lieutenant An Jeong-joon
is an ex-Special Forces soldier

84
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,417
from the 11th Corps.

85
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,920
He is currently under the
Protection Squadron.

86
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:27,006
He said he was on vacation
during the second special summit.

87
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:32,220
A punk supposedly on vacation
engages in a shoot-out in broad daylight?

88
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,555
Senior Lieutenant An was being pursued

89
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,933
and those were the people pursuing him.

90
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:41,896
Judging from their arms, maneuvers,
and reaction times,

91
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:43,981
they must be specially trained.

92
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:47,735
They aren't Americans. I think they are
from somewhere near Russia.

93
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:49,153
Identities are confirmed.

94
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,781
They are armed officers
from the Embassy of Matovonia.

95
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,574
Armed diplomatic officers?

96
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:57,328
Yes, Senior Lieutenant An used a forged
Matovonian passport at the port of entry.

97
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,080
That's why they were pursuing him.

98
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,750
Armed diplomatic officers in
a shoot-out over a forged passport?

99
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,753
The excuse is too thin.

100
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:07,046
You did a good job.

101
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,049
International law says
we have no jurisdiction.

102
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,386
We should find out more about
Senior Lieutenant An on our side.

103
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:14,762
The hospital called.

104
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,764
Senior Lieutenant An's surgery
just finished.

105
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:20,851
How did it go?

106
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,145
-What?
-The surgery.

107
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,983
He's okay.

108
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,526
We just moved him into recovery.

109
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,152
He is still unconscious.

110
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:36,325
Besides him, there is another patient
whose life was just saved.

111
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,078
I guess that patient
just sees me as a doctor.

112
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:42,331
An hour ago, this doctor experienced hell
when she seen her boyfriend

113
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:45,126
being wheeled into the emergency room
in cardiac arrest.

114
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,255
-I am sorry.
-Is that all?

115
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:51,966
How about an explanation?
Once again you don't have one?

116
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,927
Aren't you curious if I am okay?

117
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:57,555
Instead you're asking about
a "not-so-close" friend?

118
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:01,976
Just get better, I will kill you later.

119
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,980
Maybe I shouldn't give this to you either.

120
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,066
What is it?

121
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,694
Why is this patient in here?

122
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:19,076
Solidarity.

123
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:24,040
I will control this patient's room
from now.

124
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,167
Medical personnel will be restricted.

125
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,585
Please cooperate.

126
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,217
I heard you were looking for me.

127
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:40,139
I think Captain Yoo wanted me to operate
because of this.

128
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:41,932
This was in the North Korean's arm.

129
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,686
-Really?
-Yes.

130
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,105
There's a rumor he's
a North Korean soldier.

131
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,858
But can we treat a North Korean person?

132
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:54,570
Of course, we should. He's injured.
We took an oath.

133
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:55,905
Aren't you scared?

134
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,407
He even came in all bloodied
from gunshot wounds.

135
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,369
It wasn't because he got drunk
and hit himself on a billboard.

136
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:02,995
We saw worse things in Uruk.

137
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,082
All the soldiers blocked at gunpoint.

138
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:09,752
Saying, "Solidarity,"
while the guns were loading.

139
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,879
"Hands off.  If you move, we'll shoot."

140
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:17,301
You're lying! What do you think
you're doing? Selling medicine?

141
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,887
I'd like to give it a whack.

142
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,515
It's the news.

143
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:25,059
I read the political section
and can't help but curse.

144
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,352
Hey, Han Ja-ae!

145
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:32,400
I heard you were held hostage.
Are you okay? Did you get hurt?

146
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,777
Where is that punk?
I'll beat him senseless.

147
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,947
Dr. Song, you just brought him
back to life from being senseless.

148
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,658
He's the patient I operated on?

149
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:45,538
Oh, Heo Jun. Oh, Schweitzer.

150
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,501
Of all things!

151
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:53,713
I heard your boyfriend came in
all bloody with the North Korean.

152
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,673
The corridor is filled with men in black.

153
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:57,758
How can you date a man like that?

154
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:00,219
Who exactly is your boyfriend?

155
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,388
You can say that again.

156
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:04,890
I don't know
what kind of person he is either.

157
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:07,935
The chairman paged me.

158
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:08,936
Then this...

159
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,646
Why is she not bothered by me?

160
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,273
What is that?

161
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:14,400
The belongings of
the unidentified patient.

162
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:17,194
Then these are all made in North Korea.

163
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:22,700
It doesn't write.

164
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:27,121
When a pen doesn't work,
you put saliva on it to use it.

165
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:30,958
I'll take these.

166
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,714
Well then.

167
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:39,967
What did he say?

168
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:43,888
Ah, that pen isn't just a regular pen.
It contains poison.

169
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:47,683
So I just almost died.

170
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,311
Are you okay?

171
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,190
Move aside.

172
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:57,485
I said move!

173
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:01,864
Why, in all the hospitals in Gangnam,
did you have to do this here?

174
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,158
At the most expensive hospital!

175
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:07,495
This is official government business.
Please cooperate.

176
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:10,790
-It's the document the army sent.
-It's not how it's done!

177
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,960
How on earth is that
just because he is injured

178
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,963
Dr. Kang's boyfriend
is government business?

179
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,424
And what about the other patient?

180
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,678
Did the two of them fight? Who won?

181
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:27,389
I'm not sure.

182
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,267
Ah, he lost. He lost. I can see he lost.

183
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,144
Who hasn't been in the army?

184
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:33,771
You were in the army?

185
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,691
-What do you take me for?
-The exempt.

186
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,568
I wasn't asking that!

187
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,320
Keep silent, please.

188
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:44,114
You keep silent. This is my hospital.

189
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,367
You settle this.

190
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:50,079
Either as a guardian
or as the physician in charge.

191
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,999
-Come here.
-Yes.

192
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:02,174
I am Captain Yoo Si-jin
of the Korean Special Forces.

193
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,846
Senior Lieutenant An Jeong-joon,
what is your current affiliation?

194
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:12,977
Why did you secretly enter South Korea?

195
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,859
What were your orders?

196
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:26,156
Whatever your mission was,

197
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:29,034
you're here, so it appears you failed.

198
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:30,786
Is that correct?

199
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:36,542
Senior Lieutenant An Jeong-joon,
I ask under the Geneva Convention,

200
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,128
will you seek political asylum?

201
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,885
It's so difficult to get him to speak.

202
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:50,014
If you were going to be this shy,
why not stay in North Korea?

203
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,892
Has he said even one word?

204
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,894
What I have reported is all.

205
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,396
"Send me to North Korea."

206
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:01,984
Why would you sneak into South Korea
just to ask to go back to the North?

207
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:07,281
I don't know the reason,
but official routes are blocked,

208
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:10,117
so you chose the most dangerous one,
through South Korea.

209
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:13,454
Asylum is the only reason
any one would go to that much trouble.

210
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,916
Just answer and we'll welcome you.

211
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,713
I'll give you time to think,
so make the right choice.

212
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:25,674
Help him punch in the numbers.

213
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:40,105
The items An Jeong-joon carried on him.

214
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,817
If the vacation was a lie,
and he was on a black-ops mission,

215
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,736
the answer will be found here.

216
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,993
I'll take it to NIS and try to crack it
as soon as possible.

217
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,499
I'm going to go crazy.

218
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,001
What did he say? Any word?

219
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,088
Nothing from the patient,
only Captain Yoo is talking.

220
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:07,758
What is he talking about?
About family, or trying to convince him?

221
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:08,926
That's...

222
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:14,974
If you use vinegar on noodles, the flavor
is too strong but if you put hot mustard--

223
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:16,308
What?

224
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,227
He's talking about buckwheat noodles.

225
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,062
What Lieutenant An told him at the summit.

226
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:21,647
Are they all crazy?

227
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:27,361
He knows we have to report ASAP,
and he's going on about noodles?

228
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:31,949
What's with that punk being
impossible to manage as a captain?

229
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:37,788
See? Look at this.
What am I supposed to do with this?

230
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:41,333
Yes, this is Lt. Colonel Park Young-soo.

231
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:45,921
So we don't know anything yet.

232
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,425
You call that a report?

233
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,802
The meeting is tomorrow.

234
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:56,515
The rep from the North is rushing
to get here a day early.

235
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:59,435
If we don't hand over
Senior Lieutenant An by morning,

236
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:02,062
there won't be a summit.

237
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,731
What's the plan now?

238
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,443
The North's delegation
has just crossed into Seoul.

239
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:11,905
Already? How did he get here so soon?
From Pyongyang to Seoul.

240
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,117
It's okay, for now.

241
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:19,371
Hello. Report immediately
if anything comes in.

242
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:26,045
We're not talking about the
top three generals in a power battle here,

243
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,297
this is just for a mere senior lieutenant.

244
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:32,217
High-ranking officers of North and South
are working hand-in-hand right now.

245
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,304
Wow. Does this make sense?

246
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:38,098
What exactly
is Senior Lieutenant An's identity?

247
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,392
Senior Lieutenant An
is on Interpol's wanted list

248
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,978
as the prime suspect of a murder.

249
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:46,940
A murder case?
Not terrorism or assassination?

250
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:51,487
Two days ago in Tokyo,
a key eye-witness in a Yakuza crime,

251
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:55,532
on his way to the courthouse to testify,
was murdered by a long range shooter.

252
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,326
Is Senior Lieutenant An the suspect?

253
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:02,456
No. The suspect's corpse was found on the
ground floor of the building he shot from.

254
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:06,794
Senior Lieutenant An
is wanted for that crime.

255
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,338
Who was it
that Senior Lieutenant An killed?

256
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,757
It's a face we're familiar with.

257
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:20,641
Lieutenant Lee Seok-jin.
He's from the Special Force 11th Corps,

258
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:21,934
just like Senior Lieutenant An.

259
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:25,062
He assassinated his former subordinate
who was linked to the Yakuza.

260
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:28,232
-It seems like that was his mission.
-So, why?

261
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:32,402
Has the SD chip recovered been decoded?

262
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:35,739
It is heavily encrypted,
so it will take about a week to decode.

263
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:39,743
But the North is asking us
to hand him over by tomorrow morning.

264
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:43,539
And the South will agree to it.
Then there isn't any time.

265
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,999
Getting him to talk is the quickest way.

266
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:50,003
He knows we're being taped,
so it's hard to get him to talk.

267
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:54,508
In times like this, a picture
of his family in the North would help.

268
00:18:55,676 --> 00:19:00,806
We'll try another way first.
We need Doctor Kang and the SD chip.

269
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,017
The SD chip that is being analyzed
by the NIS?

270
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,561
I guess it'll be hard to get?

271
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,772
I think I made a mistake.

272
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:11,483
I should've made a copy
before handing it in.

273
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:14,862
Something like this?

274
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:19,283
So thorough.

275
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:21,535
Do you need me to send in Dr. Kang?

276
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:27,457
There's a bone fragment from a previous
fracture that wasn't fixed properly.

277
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,543
The gunshot injury is in four parts.

278
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:31,587
This is just the new ones from this time.

279
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:40,512
The most serious is the old shrapnel
wedged by your spine.

280
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:45,100
If we leave it in, it could touch the
dura nerve and you could be paralyzed,

281
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,643
patient Senior Lieutenant An.

282
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:51,356
I'm saying it is amazing
that you are still alive.

283
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,735
I'm saying you shouldn't live
your one and only life recklessly.

284
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:57,112
There's another person like that here
in the South.

285
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,324
This senseless person.

286
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:05,120
And I wasn't going to say this...

287
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,289
That soldier guy that we saw in Uruk.

288
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:10,667
Who?

289
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:14,463
You know the one that chewed me out
for performing surgery on a dying patient,

290
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:17,299
that rockfish-looking guy
who put you in isolation.

291
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:20,510
I saw him earlier asking our staff
about injection drugs and pills.

292
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,054
Are we his subordinates?

293
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:24,932
Why does he treat us however he pleases…

294
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,071
THIS ROOM IS WIRED.
NO MORE MALICIOUS TALK!

295
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,323
What am I going to do?

296
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:55,504
So what I mean is that soldier guy
probably understands now, right?

297
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,547
He knows I'm glad to see him again.

298
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:00,133
I almost ran to him
and gave him a big hug.

299
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:03,387
I think he knows everything
since he is such a wonderful man.

300
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:04,846
He is an awesome man, yes.

301
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:08,183
-Is your mother doing well, Dr. Kang?
-Pardon?

302
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:11,061
Yes. She gets credit for all the
food she makes for me

303
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:13,188
and she spends
my money on a regular basis.

304
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:17,025
I need a quiet place to speak
with Senior Lieutenant An.

305
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,612
She is doing very well.

306
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:27,452
I didn't get to greet her properly.
Let's set a date.

307
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,663
You decide on the location, though.

308
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,333
Do I really have to?

309
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:38,380
I don't want to do it, and my mom
wouldn't want me to do it either.

310
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:43,760
There's nothing to worry about.

311
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,555
You never keep your word.

312
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,893
All I'm asking is for is your help.

313
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:02,279
Don't leave me behind next time
just because I'm drunk.

314
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,991
Come to the CT room in 30 minutes
with Senior Lieutenant An.

315
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:07,451
I have to do more tests.

316
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:11,913
Don't be a minute late
because we are busy with patients.

317
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:35,604
Lieutenant. Colonel, Sir? It's so funny
to run into you like this again.

318
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,439
Wow, it's so nice to see you.

319
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,649
We'll say you gave me a big hug.

320
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:40,942
What?

321
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,613
We seem to always meet when there's
a lot going on in the country.

322
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:47,199
I know, right? Well, then, Sir.

323
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,590
What is it? What's going on?

324
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:05,717
Don't you know we're behind?

325
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,010
Give me 10 minutes.

326
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,971
This is the only place
that wouldn't be wired.

327
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:13,433
Wiretapping? What are you saying?

328
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:15,310
It's for your own good.

329
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:18,271
I am working for our country right now.

330
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:21,733
Does this country know
you're working for it?

331
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,778
Just promise me one thing.

332
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:28,990
Even if the country denies me,
I hope that you will still remember me.

333
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,325
Do you want to die?

334
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,494
What is all of this?

335
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:40,544
This place isn't wired
so you can talk comfortably.

336
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:48,343
I got us here away from
the team's prying eyes.

337
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:52,514
At most, we have ten minutes.
I want to help you.

338
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:55,851
This is your last chance.

339
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:03,775
So what's the problem?

340
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:07,487
Lieutenant Lee Seok-jin...

341
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:11,783
Why did you kill him?

342
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:16,037
Give me my stuff back first.

343
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:22,544
Is this what you're looking for?

344
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:31,720
Now it's my turn to get some answers.

345
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:36,391
What's on that thing?

346
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:52,657
The special forces members who finished
final training are on a mercenary market.

347
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:56,203
We were being sold at a high price
as hitmen for crime organizations

348
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:58,038
like the Mafia and Yakuza.

349
00:24:58,121 --> 00:24:59,498
There was an intelligence report on it.

350
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:04,377
North Star #13, mission accomplished.
Please confirm the deposit.

351
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:08,715
My mission was to punish all the traitors

352
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:12,135
and reveal who ordered the shooting.

353
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:16,723
Did you get the evidence
to reveal who was behind it?

354
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:19,559
Of course.

355
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,732
I'm sure you looked into it already.

356
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,195
The password was too complicated.

357
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,447
What is your password?

358
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:36,117
It would be easier
if you just told me what's on it.

359
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,916
None of your business.

360
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:45,585
Our Republic will take care of
our own business.

361
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:50,298
The Republic is...
already doing something.

362
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:56,388
Chief of Security Choi

363
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,558
is on his way over here
so we can hand you over.

364
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:03,603
Tomorrow, you will be

365
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:07,107
transferred back to the North.

366
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:19,703
Could this area be wired too?

367
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,622
No, not here.

368
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:26,501
I can't even breathe
in the hospital rooms.

369
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:28,670
This will be ending soon.

370
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:29,963
Thanks for your help.

371
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,757
I seriously hate you sometimes.

372
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,427
Were you able to talk
with Senior Lieutenant An?

373
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,761
Yes, thanks to you.

374
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:42,434
Oh, and his actual name is
An Jeong-joon.

375
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:45,478
-His rank is senior lieutenant.
-Oh...

376
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:49,190
Is it okay for you to blurt out the name
of a North Korean person like this?

377
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:52,360
I just wanted someone to remember it,
that's all.

378
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:57,907
Especially a brave person like you,
Dr. Kang.

379
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:06,041
I gave him some painkillers
and a sedative,

380
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,376
so he'll be in a deep sleep
for about five hours.

381
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,273
Where are you going?

382
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:18,571
In the South, you can't be discharged
without the doctor's permission.

383
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:22,075
Move out of the way.

384
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,661
I need to complete this mission.

385
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:28,665
I told you, you'll be transferred
to the North in the morning.

386
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:34,796
Is your relationship with
Chief of Security Choi a difficult one?

387
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:40,719
I thought about the reasons
why you came to me.

388
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:44,264
Because I'm a distant friend,

389
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,224
your enemy...

390
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:50,603
is my enemy, isn't that so?

391
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:56,443
Did you betray your homeland?

392
00:28:56,526 --> 00:29:01,281
Or did your homeland betray you?

393
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:13,168
A real warrior
would never betray his homeland.

394
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:30,268
Who survived?

395
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:36,149
Is it the North Star?

396
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,194
Or is it Pluto?

397
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:41,821
Chief Comrade, sir.

398
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:44,115
It is indeed Pluto.

399
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:47,285
You are fit to be the hero instructor
of the 11th corps.

400
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:51,289
Are you the traitor?

401
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,462
How could that be?

402
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:02,550
You're the traitor, Pluto.

403
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:22,111
I'm asking a favor.

404
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:26,157
Let me run away.

405
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,660
If you go to the North,
they will kill you,

406
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:30,954
whether the traitor is you
or the Republic.

407
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:33,790
There's a mission
that I must put an end to.

408
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:35,583
You will die if you go!

409
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:38,878
Even if I die, I will die in the North.

410
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:41,589
Please let me go.

411
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:54,769
I am truly a soldier
who follows the orders given to me.

412
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,230
I can't let you go.

413
00:30:58,064 --> 00:31:00,358
The cost of the buckwheat noodles
in Pyongyang,

414
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:04,529
I paid you back
during the last shoot out.

415
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,218
It's a farewell gift.

416
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:30,972
It's delicious,
so save it for a special occasion.

417
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:49,490
Did you see your friend off safely?

418
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:54,287
Your friend discharged himself
without his doctor's permission. There.

419
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,667
We aren't that close.

420
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,422
Oh, the pain is back.

421
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:06,883
-Sit properly.
-Yes.

422
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,011
Did you break that glass window?

423
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:13,681
I didn't break it.
The guy who left broke it.

424
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:16,142
Then did you break
the downstairs glass window?

425
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:18,269
My friend did.

426
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:22,732
I guess as his friend,
you will pay for the repair.

427
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:26,402
As I told you, we aren't that close...

428
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:30,365
You realize how much the Chairman
is going to harass me about those?

429
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:31,783
Where is the chairman?

430
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:34,327
Why does he hold on
to someone else's woman?

431
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:37,622
Because my boyfriend got admitted
with a North Korean soldier.

432
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:38,665
Yes.

433
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:45,922
I'll be back in two hours,
finish taking the IV and then wait.

434
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:49,092
Try running away somewhere...

435
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:51,886
Hello?

436
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:02,522
So you use dissection
as your prenatal care.

437
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:04,232
You have a week left, don't you?

438
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:05,900
Yes. Next week.

439
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,902
Did you see Dr. Kang's boyfriend?

440
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,321
-I heard he is handsome.
-What good is that?

441
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:13,032
He was brought in
with a North Korean soldier shot by a gun.

442
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:15,284
I heard the North Korean man
was also handsome.

443
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,996
Makes you wish for unification.

444
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:21,874
Hey!

445
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,463
You should change clothes
before wandering around.

446
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:30,299
If you wear scrubs with a belly
as big as Namsan,

447
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:31,801
how will the patients feel?

448
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:34,345
Hey, did your crappy
surgical skills ever improve?

449
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:37,140
Hey, always wear a gown,

450
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:39,726
so people know if you're a patient,
or a doctor.

451
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:42,311
What? What did you say just now?

452
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,440
Ah! What are you doing?

453
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:53,281
-My water broke. The baby's coming.
-Didn't you say you had a week left?

454
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:57,785
-Please page Dr. Jung from obstetrics.
-Okay.

455
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:58,911
Are you gonna let go?

456
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:02,123
Harder.
-Here?

457
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,541
No, with your hand.

458
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:06,085
-Hey! What are you doing?
-Fighting!

459
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:16,137
-The hospital administration?
-Yes. I came about the window repair fee.

460
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,890
He said you were the guardian
of Yoo Si-jin.

461
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:21,559
Do you think that patient
needs a guardian?

462
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:23,644
The upper and lower floor windows
are broken.

463
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:28,149
This didn't occur from a natural disaster,
someone must take responsibility.

464
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:29,984
Why do you think it should be me?

465
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,904
The chairman told me to bill Dr. Kang.

466
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:36,365
I also think that is right.

467
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,284
Clench your teeth.

468
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:40,661
Why are you here?

469
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:44,874
I'm the attending physician of the
downstairs room that Yoo Si-jin broke.

470
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:47,085
He didn't break it.
The North Korean patient did.

471
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,170
But he got discharged.

472
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:51,297
-So you...
-Your teeth.

473
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:55,009
Wait a minute.

474
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:58,471
Hello.

475
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,098
The baby?

476
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:02,350
Already?

477
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:05,311
-The baby's coming now?
-Yes. I'll be right there.

478
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:07,980
-I'm going.
-Oh, okay. Go. Go.

479
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:10,691
The baby's coming!
Isn't this such a joyous time?

480
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:13,152
Hey, Dr. Kang! Doctor!

481
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:18,032
The pushovers in the South are talking
about some inter-Korea reunion

482
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,326
for displaced families
and economic cooperation.

483
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:24,163
They say the future of the southeast
is dependent on peaceful negotiations.

484
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,125
However, the higher
a wired fence is, the safer it is.

485
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:30,628
The farther the relationship between
the South and the North, the better.

486
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:33,339
Go outside.

487
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:44,851
My thinking wasn't wrong.

488
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:52,984
To get what we want,
it's threats over conversation.

489
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:54,777
It's anxiety over peace.

490
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:58,990
It's good to see your face again.

491
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:09,125
Pluto #51, I will give a report
on the mission.

492
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:14,964
I've carried out the punishment on
North Star #13 for betraying the Republic.

493
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:20,428
I was able to verify the voice
that gave the orders.

494
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:22,930
I know.

495
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:28,019
I also heard that the transaction file
was secured.

496
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:32,440
Where is the file?

497
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:41,782
Seeing how quiet the southerners are,
it looks like nobody has cracked it.

498
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:45,912
It should be doing well somewhere
inside your body. Working as intended.

499
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:05,097
The secret should be buried forever
with the traitor's corpse.

500
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,601
Speak, if you have any last words.

501
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:16,025
On my memorial table, just put a bowl
of Pyongyang buckwheat noodles.

502
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:21,530
If possible, I ask that you make it
a bowl of Koryo Hotel's buckwheat noodles.

503
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:26,744
That isn't difficult to do.

504
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:31,332
It seems you have nothing else to say.

505
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:35,711
Since the order is done,
I will also perform my last duty.

506
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:42,677
In the name of the Republic, the traitor
of the State Security Department,

507
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,971
Chief Choi Jung-ho, I will execute you.

508
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:27,680
SECOND NORTH AND SOUTH SUMMIT:
CONDITIONS REQUIRED

509
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:29,181
What is this?

510
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:33,227
For the settlement on the reunion meeting
of the displaced families,

511
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,813
these are the requirements
sought by the Republic.

512
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:40,318
We have already shown our sincerity
by letting Senior Lieutenant An go.

513
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:44,030
Don't people from the south like to talk?

514
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:46,240
I'm saying we should keep talking.

515
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:50,870
Before the conditions listed are settled,
there should be a negotiation.

516
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:55,708
The conditions listed here seem to be…

517
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,919
"Who cares about separated families?
What do they matter?"

518
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,923
"Forget the North-South communication."

519
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:06,635
I think that's what is written in here.
Am I right?

520
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:13,351
The good thing about communication
between the North and South

521
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,519
is that we don't need interpreters.

522
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:21,359
I will take it that
I have the answer and I will be leaving.

523
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:26,530
Please sit for a moment.

524
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:31,994
I think you should
take a look at this first.

525
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:40,002
It seems like you got some money
for selling your subordinates.

526
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,838
How much is in here?

527
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,147
What is it?

528
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:04,527
There are orders to immediately send you
and Senior Lieutenant An to Pyongyang.

529
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:08,322
Senior Lieutenant An is alive?

530
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:39,186
The secret should be buried forever
with the traitor's corpse.

531
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:44,024
If possible, I ask that you make it a bowl
of Koryo Hotel's buckwheat noodles.

532
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:53,868
He has said the password.
The password is...

533
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,871
The GPS location of Koryo Hotel
in Pyongyang.

534
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:07,965
The South Korean Special Forces
are hopeless.

535
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:13,262
He shot me right
where it wouldn't kill me.

536
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:22,855
Come with us silently, Comrade.

537
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:27,526
I have an order to bring in your corpse
if you try anything funny.

538
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,404
Give me just two minutes.

539
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:33,866
Can I have a snack before we go?

540
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:39,330
For the sake of a cookie.

541
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:42,458
I will definitely pay for it,
even in the next life.

542
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:46,003
Thanks to you...

543
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:48,797
I can go back to my country

544
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:52,259
and I can die there as a soldier.

545
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:58,098
Thank you.

546
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:30,714
2ND NORTH-SOUTH
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT

547
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:35,344
Chief Choi and his group canceled
the luncheon and left for Pyongyang.

548
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:36,512
That's right.

549
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:41,892
But… is it okay to hand over the original
through a political trade?

550
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:44,228
Why would that be an issue?
We have many copies.

551
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:49,525
There's a person called General Park,
who is on bad terms with Chief Choi.

552
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:51,694
I shot him... an email.

553
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:54,154
South Korea is strong in IT.

554
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:58,033
Politics should be based
on the foundation of ethics.

555
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:01,036
The one who did bad should be punished.

556
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,497
Justice will prevail.
Reward virtue and punish evil.

557
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:08,168
What about the ethics of
keeping a political agreement then?

558
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:10,045
You have a long way to go.

559
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:12,631
Hey, do politics always work
according to ethics?

560
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:16,093
What time is the press conference?

561
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:18,929
I need to go choose a necktie.

562
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:21,974
She's coming. Ten meters.

563
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:26,061
Please hurry. Five meters!

564
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:30,983
-The cast, I can't get my pants off.
-Then why put it back on?

565
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:32,818
-A perfect crime?
-One meter.

566
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:35,362
Hurry.

567
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:45,706
Captain just fell asleep.

568
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:48,042
That's good.

569
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:52,880
You didn't just get back
from being somewhere, did you?

570
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:54,798
Oh, how could we do that?

571
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:56,759
I'll be back later.

572
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,102
Wow, that...

573
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:13,651
Why did you have to put that back on?

574
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,569
I didn't get hurt because I wanted...

575
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:22,451
Sergeant has just fallen asleep.

576
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:25,037
That's right.

577
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:28,582
Sergeant First Class Seo
is going through a lot caring for you.

578
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:35,798
I forgot trusting people like you
puts me at a disadvantage.

579
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:39,343
Then why are you here?

580
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:55,275
Perfect crime?

581
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,112
What will you do about the windows?

582
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:02,324
I have a good idea.
How about we go halves like men?

583
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:05,661
Oh, that. Great idea...

584
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:09,164
-I'm saying I'm on a reduced salary.
-I'm saying I'm not manly.

585
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:20,050
What are you doing here?

586
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:23,470
Long time, no see.
You've been well, right?

587
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:26,598
I see a variety of things every day.

588
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:30,018
-Are you here to visit Captain Yoo?
-Yes. He didn't die, right?

589
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:33,147
Not yet, but he will
if I have anything to do with it

590
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:36,191
Go up! Sergeant First Class Seo
is with him too.

591
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:39,528
I saw Sergeant First Class Seo's car
in the parking lot.

592
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:42,406
-That's why.
-What do you mean "that's why?"

593
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:44,324
Did you fight with him?

594
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:47,119
No. We broke up.

595
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:49,246
I've nothing to do with him now.

596
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:51,623
Really? Why? When?

597
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,043
-Makes sense.
-Why do you jump to that conclusion?

598
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:58,756
I understand. They are in Room 710.

599
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,258
They are Dumb and Dumber.

600
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:05,471
The country better not find out
those men are like that.

601
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:07,973
Sergeant First Class Seo
wasn't hurt, right?

602
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,477
You said you have nothing to do with him.

603
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:13,896
I was just asking as a doctor.

604
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:16,315
I'm going.

605
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:23,572
Your love life is also...

606
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:34,917
Am I the only one
suffocating in this room?

607
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:40,964
If you're here for a visit, then can you
show a little concern for the patient?

608
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:43,425
Your girlfriend who's worrying a lot,
is outside.

609
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:44,927
Should I call for her?

610
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:48,096
No. She already worried a lot and left.

611
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:52,059
You look fine, so I'll just go now.

612
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:58,398
You could have come empty-handed,
but you bought such a gift.

613
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:00,943
At least offer her a chair.

614
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:03,737
-I'll let you two speak.
-I'm going.

615
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:06,615
-I will leave.
-I said I will leave.

616
00:47:06,698 --> 00:47:09,493
If the two of you leave,
then who'll stay with me?

617
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:13,914
It'd be better if he were lying there.

618
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:16,834
Oh, he did lie down here briefly
in my place earlier.

619
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:20,128
You didn't know?  Sergeant First Class Seo
is really feminine.

620
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:23,966
Hey, earlier he was putting his hair
behind his ears.

621
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,301
I was just joking.

622
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:28,929
Oh, this face! That's the face!

623
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:31,974
Pushing his hair back
behind his ear, saying, "Oh my!"

624
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:33,141
I didn't say, "Oh my."

625
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:37,813
You are Dumb and Dumber.
Take care of yourself.

626
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:42,442
Ah, you idiot!

627
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:46,446
I did the best I could to help.

628
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:47,865
That's why I stopped you.

629
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:50,909
Ah, it'll be resolved this way?

630
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:55,622
What happened? Why did you break up?

631
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:58,500
I... filed for a discharge.

632
00:48:01,503 --> 00:48:04,047
-What did you say?
-It's a choice I have to make.

633
00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:05,424
it was just that.

634
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:10,387
You filed for what?

635
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:15,642
I'm sorry.

636
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,939
How could you decide this by yourself?

637
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:24,985
I am really upset.

638
00:48:26,486 --> 00:48:27,321
I am sorry.

639
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:29,281
Does the Commander know?

640
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:33,035
Myeong-ju was also there
when I saw the Commander.

641
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:40,083
Go and get her, quick.

642
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:42,628
She's the woman you risked your life for.

643
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:45,339
Don't keep her waiting for too long.

644
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:43,397
What do you think is going on
with those two?

645
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:45,440
From what I can tell...

646
00:49:47,776 --> 00:49:48,652
They had a fight,

647
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:50,737
and First Lieutenant Yoon
broke up with him.

648
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:52,656
But it was for his sake.

649
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:55,617
That's why
First Lieutenant Yoon can't lose.

650
00:49:57,744 --> 00:50:00,330
Because she is a good woman.

651
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:05,585
From what I can tell...

652
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:09,423
Sergeant First Class Seo knows where
First Lieutenant Yoon is hiding.

653
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:13,260
He wants to hold on to her but he doesn't.

654
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:17,889
For the sake of her pride,
she's trying hard to hide.

655
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:23,895
Because Sergeant First Class Seo
is a good man.

656
00:50:25,772 --> 00:50:27,190
What are you doing tonight?

657
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:29,276
If nothing special, come shopping with me.

658
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:30,360
What are you buying?

659
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:33,280
Car shopping?

660
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:35,198
I told you I would buy a new car
in Korea.

661
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:37,868
What's the use of saving money
when you might die?

662
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:39,077
I'll die broke.

663
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:41,455
I'm going to spend it on myself.

664
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:42,873
What if you don't die?

665
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:46,460
Regardless, I'll still spend it.

666
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:47,669
Pick and choose.

667
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:49,838
What do you like?

668
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:54,843
I like this one.

669
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:58,138
You just interfered in my life.
Why? Do you like me?

670
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:00,474
The salesman recommended it, too.

671
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:02,809
You just made eye contact with me.
Is it because you like me?

672
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:03,810
Yes.

673
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:06,146
You just said you liked me.
Why? Do you--

674
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:10,567
-Oh, wow.
-Hurry up and sign. I'm hungry.

675
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:14,279
Please bring me a contract. Quickly.

676
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:25,123
The South and North decided to hold
a reunion for 100 families next month.

677
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:28,835
During yesterday's South-North Summit
held in Panmunjom,

678
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:32,047
they agreed
and produced a signed agreement.

679
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:37,803
As a result, the delayed family reunions,
will be held for first time in five years.

680
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:42,057
The two Koreas will meet soon
to figure out the details.

681
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:50,690
A successful South-North Summit,

682
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:52,818
and an agreement made
about the Family Reunion.

683
00:52:07,749 --> 00:52:09,793
Don't worry.
I'm here because I'm off work.

684
00:52:09,876 --> 00:52:10,919
You're not going home?

685
00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:13,630
I'm your guardian until tonight.

686
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:17,717
When will I get discharged?

687
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:19,511
Can I stay here for like a week?

688
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:23,682
I really like seeing your face
every two hours because of your rounds.

689
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:25,976
You really liked it,
but you still went out?

690
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:28,895
Where did you go?

691
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:32,065
-The roof, to get some air.
-I checked there.

692
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:35,277
I didn't say it was this rooftop.

693
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:40,282
Did you go to the department store again?

694
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:46,580
With your friend?

695
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:51,793
Why come back alone?

696
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:56,548
We had different paths to follow.

697
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:01,970
I'm feeling down.

698
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:04,931
Can you console me instead of scolding me?

699
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:07,392
Why are you feeling down?

700
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:12,355
I protected the peace of the
Korean peninsula,

701
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:15,859
but tonight, my friend may die.

702
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:21,489
And your girlfriend is worrying about you.

703
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:30,332
Have you ever laid in a patient's bed?

704
00:53:33,126 --> 00:53:34,211
Climb in here.

705
00:53:37,088 --> 00:53:38,840
How could she refuse?

706
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:42,719
Why are you being so hard on me?

707
00:53:42,802 --> 00:53:44,471
I am a patient, after all.

708
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:46,056
I can't even do anything.

709
00:53:46,139 --> 00:53:48,975
You went to the department store.

710
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:51,686
A doctor should protect herself.

711
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:56,274
-What are you talking about?
-I don't know. I'm sleepy.

712
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:08,828
Doctor Lee Chi-hoon
became a dad earlier today.

713
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:11,248
It's a boy.

714
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:15,418
Remember that if you buy a gift.

715
00:54:16,878 --> 00:54:18,630
He should be cute like his dad.

716
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:22,092
Please send him my congratulations.

717
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:25,136
Transmission received.

718
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:30,517
I'm sorry for making you worry.

719
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:36,898
Thank you for saving my life.

720
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:50,036
Why are we always thanking each other
for saving our lives?

721
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:56,918
Other couples are thankful
for giving each other rides home,

722
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:02,090
thankful for celebrating anniversaries,
or something like that.

723
00:55:04,884 --> 00:55:05,885
I'm sorry.

724
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,178
Is that true?

725
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:10,390
What do you mean?

726
00:55:11,891 --> 00:55:17,772
I saw what kind of peace you protected
on the news.

727
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:23,987
Don't ever apologize for that.

728
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:30,827
But don't ever show up covered in blood.

729
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:35,999
I beg you.

730
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:40,045
Transmission received.

731
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:46,885
Do you want to watch a movie?

732
00:55:46,968 --> 00:55:47,927
The one we missed?

733
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:49,846
Here?

734
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:54,392
They have those cool things
in the VIP rooms.

735
00:55:57,687 --> 00:55:58,855
And this too.

736
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:05,612
Wow, we get to see the movie this way.

737
00:56:05,987 --> 00:56:07,655
I couldn't ever imagine that.

738
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:10,283
We finally made it to the play button.

739
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:12,786
Last time, it stopped at the payment.

740
00:56:13,411 --> 00:56:14,245
It's starting.

741
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:26,132
We didn't know who fell asleep first.

742
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:32,847
It was a long and tiring day,
and I was in his arms.

743
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:38,895
Lying there, I felt the spark.

744
00:56:39,854 --> 00:56:41,815
I felt like a woman that was being loved.

745
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:45,819
I wonder if the movie
we didn't get to see

746
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:51,658
had a happy ending or a sad ending.

747
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,436
Weren't you going to shower?
You're still dressed.

748
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:22,480
-Let me watch you fill the tub first.
-Don't even think about it.

749
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:26,151
Do you know that we have never said
 "I love you" to each other?

750
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:27,819
Our bodies said it instead.

751
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:30,280
I'm thinking about sending you
on this mission.

752
00:57:30,655 --> 00:57:35,160
Otherwise, I may have to sign
your discharge request right now.

753
00:57:35,243 --> 00:57:37,370
-What should we do?
-I would like to go.

754
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:40,623
I'll be sure to return
before the seasons change.

755
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:43,460
Sergeant First Class Seo returned,
didn't he?

756
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:45,837
What brings you here,
Staff Sergeant Choi?

757
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:52,886
