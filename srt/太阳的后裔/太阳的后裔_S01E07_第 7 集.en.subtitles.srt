1
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:04,397
I was hoping you weren't hurt.

2
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:11,696
This whole time, I regretted

3
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,033
leaving without seeing you that morning.

4
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,912
I can't always stay by your side,

5
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,081
so please...

6
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,043
take care of yourself.

7
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,253
You too, Captain.

8
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:09,879
EPISODE 7

9
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:16,636
This is the Taebaek rescue squad!
Is anyone in there?

10
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,180
If there is, knock three times!

11
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,027
It looks like my judgment was wrong.

12
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:35,780
No.

13
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,035
If most of the second shift staff working
the mine escaped using the east stairway,

14
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:43,788
this is the right place to search.

15
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,498
I've shut off the gas.

16
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,458
How is it over there?

17
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:52,046
Over there is a hundred times
better than here.

18
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,965
The building there stands strong...

19
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:58,553
The obstacles there are nothing compared
to what's here. Let's open there up first.

20
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:01,222
No, we can't.
There are still loose rocks falling.

21
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:02,432
What loose rocks?

22
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:05,602
Why are you making a big deal
out of rocks?

23
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,147
If that scares you so much,
how will you be able to rescue anyone?

24
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:10,773
You're so frustrating.

25
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:14,611
After an earthquake, a building that
hasn't collapsed is more dangerous.

26
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,487
The outside may look fine,

27
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:20,074
but the inside is sensitive to the shocks.

28
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:29,751
Even the slightest movement of equipment

29
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:32,086
could cause bigger secondary damage.

30
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:34,297
I can hear something!

31
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:38,051
It's faint, but I can definitely hear
the signal of a survivor.

32
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,353
Prepare a visual and magnify
the inside as much as you can.

33
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:49,520
Yes, sir.

34
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:03,368
Hey, what use is a young man like you
with no strength?

35
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,037
Hit it louder.

36
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,581
It hurts.

37
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:12,377
Hurry, hurry. Safety comes first.

38
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,629
Safety comes first.

39
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:20,134
I know safety comes first.
I'm really sorry.

40
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:22,762
We tried to build this strong.

41
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:26,432
Who would have known
an earthquake would hit?

42
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:32,146
Anyway, let's just wait a little longer
since they're looking for us outside--

43
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,066
-Do you hear something?
-I do.

44
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:36,526
Did you hear that?

45
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:38,903
Who is it? 

46
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:40,571
Who's there?

47
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:43,199
-Is that a rescue team?
-Isn't that Manager Ko's voice?

48
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,535
Yes? That's right!

49
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,078
-Mr. Park!
-Manager Ko?

50
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:50,498
-Where are you?
-Manager, I think we're above you!

51
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,041
Just a little longer.

52
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,086
The rescue team is working
from the outside.

53
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:58,131
Yes, yes, over here. They're here.

54
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:02,510
Please hurry!
There are a lot of injured people!

55
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,178
Hurry!

56
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:09,517
Lifting up the concrete that fell and
blocked the entrance is critical.

57
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,229
A pulley won't handle the weight. We have
no other option but to drill a hole.

58
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,481
Suggest something that actually
makes sense!

59
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:18,651
This is reinforced concrete made for
a special type of building.

60
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,362
Drilling through this thickness would
take over three days.

61
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,864
We need an alternative plan.

62
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:25,366
I told you there's an easy way.

63
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,827
I said we should use machinery!

64
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:31,039
I told you already,
heavy equipment is dangerous

65
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,540
because of the weak structure.

66
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,625
Then, here.

67
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:38,004
Here. Isn't the entrance through
the office okay?

68
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:42,008
You said there weren't
any signals from the survivors!

69
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:44,385
Let's use the possible methods first,
please!

70
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,387
There are important documents there.

71
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:50,600
Are you saying we should disregard
people's lives for some documents?

72
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:53,603
I think you've misunderstood.

73
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:59,275
The person in charge of this site is me,
the Uruk Power Plant Chief Manager!

74
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,779
So you do whatever I tell you to do--

75
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:06,199
At a disaster site, the commander of
the rescue team has final authority.

76
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:07,909
And that's me.

77
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:15,416
What bastard let civilians enter
the rescue site?

78
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:18,086
-Hey, you!
-Please leave the site.

79
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:19,879
-Leave.
-Leave now.

80
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:22,715
You leave, you bastard.
Get out of my way! Hey!

81
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,968
You? Where did you go to ROTC?

82
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,513
Tell the Company Commander to come out,
you bastard!

83
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:31,349
Let go, you bastard!

84
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,478
If we can't go from the top,
how about from the bottom using air bags?

85
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:39,148
It's too much.
The airbag can only handle 10 tons.

86
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,110
That's if we use one,
but if we use four at the pressure point

87
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,528
and lift them all at once,

88
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:44,987
it would be possible.

89
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:54,580
But we only have one air pump,

90
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:57,417
supplying air to all of them
simultaneously is impossible.

91
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,544
That's the problem.

92
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,841
What if we filled the rest with water?

93
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,010
The water supply lines are still working.

94
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:13,683
Damp-proof the three airbags
and supply water to them simultaneously.

95
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:15,768
The connection is complete.

96
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:22,942
But water-filled air bags won't handle
the tension for long.

97
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:27,905
We secure space for a body to get through,
and keep it open as long as possible.

98
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:30,908
We can try it.

99
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,619
The plan is set. Get moving.

100
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:34,579
Yes, sir.

101
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:54,974
Gastrointestinal perforation
can turn into peritonitis.

102
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:57,518
-Transfer him to Medi Cube.
-We don't have transportation.

103
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:00,855
One is en route
and the another one is in for repairs.

104
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:02,231
This is bad.

105
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,817
-The phones still aren't working, right?
-No.

106
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:08,029
Doctor! Doctor! Here you go.

107
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:10,072
-Here you go.
-Where did you get these?

108
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:13,826
There's that one foreign doctor, right?
He came to the Medi Cube with a patient.

109
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,121
He said a village
near the city nearly disappeared.

110
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:18,789
He told me to hand these out.

111
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,750
The channel has been set to three.

112
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,336
Dr. Kang, can you hear me?

113
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:26,380
Daniel? Thank you for the radios.

114
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:27,757
Tremendous help!

115
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:29,592
Nurse! Nurse!

116
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,802
Give me permission to use your OR.

117
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,721
The patient is bleeding
and has a skull fracture.

118
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:37,099
I was told to ask to use the OR,
I don't have the guardian's permission.

119
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,602
I'm about to open his head
outside of the OR. Over.

120
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,646
That would be medical malpractice!

121
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,147
Is the manager there?

122
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,732
You can hear me, right?

123
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,401
Are you only taking appointments?

124
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,237
Do you think
you're treating VIPs in Seoul?

125
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,864
I'm opening it.

126
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,077
-It's open.
-Thank you.

127
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:58,913
Please save him.

128
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:01,916
So he can live and sue you
for malpractice, Daniel.

129
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:04,627
Roger! I sent Ye-hwa.
Ask her if you need a hand.

130
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:08,089
I'll need hands and feet!
Thank you. Over.

131
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:31,737
Trusting in air bags
that could explode at any moment

132
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:35,575
and you're going to crawl in
underneath that concrete.

133
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:40,788
Only those with a death wish
would do that.

134
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:43,708
We will.

135
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,877
It's ready.

136
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:21,996
This is control center.
We've secured an entry into the basement.

137
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:25,082
We are starting
the rescue operation right now.

138
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,002
Please send the medical team to the site.

139
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,852
We're alive!

140
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:53,819
Are you okay?

141
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,031
This way.

142
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,286
Sir, what is your name?

143
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:06,582
Park Yong-man. I'm okay.

144
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:12,380
But Manager Ko...
was somewhere below where I was,

145
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:16,717
We are preparing for
the second search mission now.

146
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,178
Don't worry.

147
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,574
Blood pressure 60/30. Drowsy condition.
Please start an IV.

148
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:41,534
Yes.

149
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,662
We're all out.

150
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,915
-Here.
-Thank you.

151
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:53,587
-Abdominal hemorrhage?
-Inflation. Pulse is weak.

152
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:01,011
He lost consciousness.
Inject 10 ml of Epinephrine!

153
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:21,657
The pulse is back.

154
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:25,953
It looks like shock induced by hemorrhage.
I need to perform a laparotomy.

155
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:27,455
We need to go to the Medi Cube.

156
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,165
The Medi Cube is full.

157
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,541
How far is headquarters?

158
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:32,501
Even by helicopter, at least 30 minutes.

159
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,170
This patient won't last that long.

160
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,463
Then we'll do it here.

161
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,174
Do what here?

162
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:39,967
His pulse is irregular.

163
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:43,554
Surgery. It's not suitable here.

164
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,890
Over there, the sunny spot.

165
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,892
-It's too dark in here.
-Are you crazy?

166
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:51,896
How can you operate without a CT scan?
You can't confirm where he's bleeding!

167
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:54,982
That's why we have to open him up
and examine. Any other ideas?

168
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,612
You want to open him up here,
in all this cement dust?

169
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:04,700
Do you know what could happen? Septicemia,
fat embolism, kidney failure or adhesion--

170
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,494
Is there another way?

171
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,830
Choose quickly. He's your patient.

172
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:13,918
This is crazy.

173
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:21,550
Get the surgical scalpel set and as much
Betagen and antiseptic gauze as possible.

174
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,551
Yes.

175
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:27,264
First, we have to move him
out of the shade.

176
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:33,646
Ye-hwa, please help us here!

177
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,358
Doctor, doctor, it's Channel Three!

178
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:38,442
Thank you.

179
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:40,820
Doctor, doctor, here!

180
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:46,408
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

181
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,452
It's fine.

182
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,871
If you're injured, just stay still.
I'll do it.

183
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:52,122
I'm sorry.

184
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:55,668
Please get me the surgical scalpel set
and Betagen.

185
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,379
Was there another aftershock here?

186
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:00,673
No, it was my fault.

187
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:03,092
What are you looking for? Vitamins?

188
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,427
How much Betagen?

189
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,264
All of it.
I use that as a disinfectant.

190
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,181
Excuse me.

191
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,362
We'll sit down for a moment.

192
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,033
-I'll take care of her here.
-Yes.

193
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,271
This is really frustrating.

194
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:03,402
You're in pain, but you won't take it
because you're afraid of shots?

195
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:06,280
If only we could communicate
in English, at least.

196
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,244
Anesthetic. It doesn't hurt.

197
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,458
Just let go.

198
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:23,047
This person, really.

199
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,049
No. No anesthetic.

200
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:29,094
-I'm pregnant. Anesthetic is dangerous.
-What are you saying?

201
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,179
Then what?

202
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,358
My baby.

203
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:59,708
No anesthetic.
No anesthetic, no matter what.

204
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:03,128
Hurry and do it, just do it.

205
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,297
This is crazy.

206
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,554
It's really going to hurt.

207
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,644
Can you endure it?

208
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:22,940
Yes.

209
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:31,824
I'm going to do it.

210
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:01,687
Doctor Kim! Doctor!

211
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,291
What do I say...

212
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,298
Nurse Ha! Nurse Ha!

213
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,134
She is a doctor. No, that's not right.

214
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,474
A real American. An American!

215
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,693
Dr. Song! 

216
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,073
He is an American.

217
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:04,833
This is Medi Cube.
Is there a doctor available to come here?

218
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,835
We're short-handed in the OR.

219
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,046
This is Dr. Song, I'll be there.

220
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,048
Yes. Quickly, please.

221
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:12,341
Got it. Over.

222
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,282
Wow, so cool.

223
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:41,245
He is normally useless,
but he is very useful as a doctor.

224
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,666
Attention! We're in need of type AB blood.

225
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:48,418
Urgently! Anyone hearing this
please respond back quickly.

226
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:52,714
Private Kim Gi-beom, I am blood type AB.

227
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:56,009
Please wipe. I can't see well.

228
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:58,929
Stabilize the retractor here.

229
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:03,183
He's blood type AB. I'll be taking
your blood. It will nip a bit.

230
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,397
Dr. Kang.

231
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,983
Did you get hurt?

232
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,318
Not me. They need a doctor in there.

233
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:15,571
Quickly, it's urgent.

234
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,077
Manager!

235
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,540
The doctor is here.

236
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,751
It's dangerous. Why did you come here?

237
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,670
I'll give you some painkillers now.

238
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:38,385
Do you have any feeling
in your legs or toes?

239
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:43,599
At my age, what strength would
I have down there?

240
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:51,273
It's moving, right?

241
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:57,404
It was hurting so much until now,

242
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:02,201
but now seeing your face,
there's no more pain.

243
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,995
Yes. You did well.

244
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,750
How long will it take to lift this up?

245
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:13,921
There's another patient
that you have to see.

246
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,966
Hurry. It hurts.

247
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:19,593
Hurry, hurry.

248
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:37,527
We have to cut the iron frame
and move him to the operating room.

249
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:40,155
Please cut it about here.

250
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,158
Let's discuss the situation.

251
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,828
-Go ahead.
-In private.

252
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:58,674
Is there a problem?

253
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:03,470
The problem is
that both sides are connected.

254
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,695
If we lift the concrete off of
Manager Ko's side,

255
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,571
the iron frame will be raised,

256
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:29,246
and the man on the opposite side
will be cut in half.

257
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,039
What if you cut the iron frame first?

258
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,627
Then we'll lose the balance,

259
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:39,631
and the concrete slabs won't be
able to support the weight load.

260
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:44,094
In order to save the person on one side,

261
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:48,390
the one on the other side has to die.
Is that what you're saying?

262
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:54,104
-Scientifically, there isn't another way.
-Medically, there isn't another choice.

263
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:57,149
In this situation,
we have to follow the rescue rules.

264
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:01,987
We save the one that the doctor thinks
will have the higher chance of survival.

265
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:06,783
So, you're telling me
to make the choice right now?

266
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:09,494
Which of the two to kill,
and which to save?

267
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:10,954
Yes.

268
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:16,126
That's what you must do right now.

269
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:32,559
They are preparing for whichever side
it will be. It will be done in 10 minutes.

270
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,983
-Has the decision been made?
-I need ten minutes, too.

271
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,485
There isn't any time.

272
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,282
Do it now.

273
00:22:57,292 --> 00:23:00,003
She made the request as a doctor.

274
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,964
-We'll do our final check as well.
-Yes.

275
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:10,555
What is this?

276
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:13,392
Captain Yoo, haven't you started working?

277
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:17,104
You're so frustrating!

278
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:20,649
You said one of them won't make it anyway,

279
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,986
so quickly wrap things up
with the easier one,

280
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,863
and break through to the office.

281
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,908
We're preparing for the rescue.

282
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:33,120
Where do you think you're going?
I'm not finished talking to you!

283
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:37,332
Do you know exactly
what those documents are?

284
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:42,629
They are treaties with the Uruk government
on peaceful business reconstruction.

285
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:45,882
I'm getting paid by this country,

286
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:49,386
but I'm saying this
because of my Korean patriotism.

287
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:53,348
When I go to karaoke,
I start with the national anthem.

288
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:54,766
Do you get it now?

289
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,561
This is a problem at the national level.

290
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:00,564
What is a soldier?

291
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:04,067
A soldier puts his duty
to his country first.

292
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:08,738
-It doesn't matter who lives or dies.
-Hey.

293
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:11,158
"Hey?"

294
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:14,453
-Did you just--
-Yeah, I'm talking to you, jerk.

295
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,167
Nation. What is a nation?

296
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:25,338
The lives and the safety of its citizens
is a nation's priority. That means...

297
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:28,717
even if a jerk like you is in danger,

298
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:31,845
the nation will do
whatever it takes to save him.

299
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,431
The nation has never given me an order

300
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:38,226
that's more important
than a citizen's life.

301
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:42,189
If those documents are
so important to you...

302
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:51,656
then go dig them up yourself.

303
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:56,077
I can't believe this.

304
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:02,125
-You're making a big mistake right now.
-Then I'll be thankful.

305
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:04,503
Get lost.

306
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,049
Look out!

307
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,656
Is everyone okay?

308
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:34,950
Everyone is okay over here!

309
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,244
Over there!

310
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,095
Are you okay?

311
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:59,516
Ah, me... yes...  

312
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,060
I am.

313
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:05,730
Reporting, there's a live wire
in the work zone.

314
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,190
Check over everything again.

315
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:08,525
Yes, I will.

316
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:35,844
Once the rescue mission starts
and the concrete slab gets lifted,

317
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,929
It will be a painful process.

318
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:40,807
-Painkillers won't be any use.
-I have three children.

319
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:44,311
-One son and two daughters.
-Excuse me?

320
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:46,187
That guy over there.

321
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:51,192
I don't know much, but it will be
difficult to save both of us, right?

322
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:57,490
It's okay.

323
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:01,328
Beginning with the highways through
the deserts of Saudi Arabia,

324
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:03,288
I've worked globally for 30 years.

325
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:05,498
I can sense what's going on.

326
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:07,584
I understand the gist of it.

327
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:14,090
No matter what happens,
we're going to do the best we can.

328
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,886
Okay, please do so.

329
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:25,727
As I don't have to work
and lay down here to see the sky,

330
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:28,188
it's really nice.

331
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:31,274
I feel so blessed.

332
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:35,820
I was able to earn money to send

333
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:37,947
my kids to college.

334
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,601
Am I gonna die?

335
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:10,397
Please, save me.  Please.

336
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:15,860
I didn't move one bit. I promise.

337
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:18,988
Good.

338
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:27,789
I'll make the incision.
Three cm. from here.

339
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:30,125
-At the right angle.
-Okay.

340
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:39,092
When this patient survives,
he owes you a meal.

341
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,510
Will he survive?

342
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:43,763
-You're saving him.
-I am?

343
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:47,392
Me, Private Kim Gi-beom...

344
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:50,437
I'm saving a life?

345
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:53,273
Can I brag to Sergeant Seo?

346
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:56,025
Wait your turn. I'm going to first.

347
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:59,005
Ugh! These rotten tabloids!

348
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,433
Neither situation looks good.

349
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:15,313
There's a danger of a secondary explosion
as there are oxygen tanks for welding.

350
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:18,733
It's unstable here.

351
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:20,985
-Be careful.
-Yes, sir.

352
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,991
Master Sergeant Seo!

353
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:29,118
What happened?

354
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:32,038
The Deputy Leader fell under the floor!

355
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:34,082
Did something happen to Sergeant Seo?

356
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:35,375
Can I take this off?

357
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:38,253
Sit down. I said, sit!
You want to kill this patient?

358
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:45,134
The 3.0 suture scissors.

359
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,511
Yes.

360
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,063
This is Wolf.

361
00:30:57,146 --> 00:31:00,233
Luckily, I landed on sand.
I didn't sustain a big injury.

362
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:01,442
I'm okay.

363
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:04,696
That's a relief.
Sergeant Seo seems to be fine.

364
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:06,990
Stop giving me updates. It's distracting.

365
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,836
We are ready.

366
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:23,756
Have you decided?

367
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,761
For Manager Ko, necrosis in
his leg muscles has already begun.

368
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:33,641
When the mass is lifted up,
he will have crush syndrome.

369
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:40,690
For the employee, the steel frame is
preventing him from bleeding out.

370
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:44,819
Even if we move him to the OR,
it will not be easy to stop the bleeding.

371
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,908
In this circumstance, if it were you...

372
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:53,202
who would you save?

373
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:00,043
Why are you asking me that?

374
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:03,504
You've had your consultation
and made your diagnosis.

375
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:07,050
You need to inform us of your decision.

376
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:12,221
Even still, you are more experienced.

377
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:14,766
I thought you could make the best choice--

378
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:19,103
Best? Do you think what I do is the best?

379
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:23,691
There is no such thing as best here.

380
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:28,112
We're just solving the problems
that we are facing.

381
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:30,531
Of course, I know it, but...

382
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:34,494
I've been seeing patients without
any order or protocol all day.

383
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:37,080
-I don't know if this is right--
-You are doing well.

384
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,208
In this situation, doing anything you can

385
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,543
or doing nothing and leaving them to die.

386
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,170
You only have time to do one.

387
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:47,423
And there is even less time to whine.

388
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:53,638
What we seek from you is not
absolute perfection or the skill of God.

389
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:57,058
Doctors can't even find
a proper treatment for a flu virus.

390
00:32:57,183 --> 00:33:04,065
We are seeking a diagnosis from
a doctor right now,

391
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,611
so if you've made a diagnosis, tell me...

392
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,072
as a doctor.

393
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:27,380
The order of rescue is...

394
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,559
The iron frame went through his chest.

395
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:41,477
Not sure if it touched the spine.

396
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,396
His reactions are normal.

397
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:46,232
-Give him antibiotics and get his X-ray--
-I know.

398
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:48,651
You said it via radio.

399
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:51,821
Leave this patient with me, get some air.

400
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:52,989
No, I will do it.

401
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:55,616
The portable X-ray is set up, right?

402
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,869
The film ran out.
The sterilizer is broken too.

403
00:33:58,369 --> 00:33:59,245
It's a mess now.

404
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:01,122
Even so, we have to do something.

405
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:03,291
You come in too. I can't do this alone.

406
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:04,542
Let's go.

407
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:19,390
The anesthesia is finished.
This patient will not die here today.

408
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:24,979
We will take out the frame
with speed and accuracy.

409
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:30,902
Now, one, two, three.

410
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,630
The vitals are all good.

411
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:16,465
Thank you.

412
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:18,092
Thank you very much.

413
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,306
Good job to you, too.

414
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:25,975
Solidarity.

415
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:52,418
Solidarity.

416
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:55,588
You worked hard today.

417
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:59,217
Now, the relief team has arrived.
Go in and rest.

418
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:35,628
They have reported
that the rescue is still ongoing.

419
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,631
The medical team did not
sustain any major injuries.

420
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:40,466
I received a report they are safe.

421
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:42,510
First Lieutenant Yoon too?

422
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:44,136
Yes. She's fine.

423
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:48,307
I also didn't stop Captain Yoo from going.

424
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:52,436
I know you were worried,
that is why I asked you to come.

425
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:55,856
Why worry,
when a soldier serves the nation?

426
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,986
I'm ashamed,

427
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:03,698
but I'm less worried about my daughter
because of Captain Yoo.

428
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,870
I cherish Captain Yoo very much.

429
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:14,375
Si-jin is able to get four stars,
so I have high expectations.

430
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:18,254
I'm not sure if he will be able to.

431
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:20,131
He is a very admirable soldier.

432
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:22,341
Many follow him from above and below.

433
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:25,553
Si-jin seems to be blessed
with good people around him.

434
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:32,310
The medical team is safe without injuries.

435
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:35,938
The Taebaek Division reported that
our team is rescuing the people there.

436
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:36,981
Please don't worry.

437
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,194
Oh, my! Are you alright?

438
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:45,531
Yes I'm alright.
That's a relief, Mother-in-law.

439
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:49,577
When are they coming back?

440
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:52,496
As soon as
the local airport resumes operations.

441
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,540
When is that?

442
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:56,709
First, let me speak with my son.

443
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:59,378
I need to hear his voice myself.

444
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:01,547
Personal calls can't be made yet.

445
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:04,633
They only have a satellite phone
in the headquarters.

446
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:05,718
-So personal--
-Hey!

447
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:09,013
I invested in that satellite.

448
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:11,390
Connect me right away. Right away!

449
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:17,688
Your mother-in-law said
"hey" to Director Lee!

450
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:23,152
The hospital site belongs to
Chi-hoon's family.

451
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:28,908
Madam, I hope I didn't do anything
to upset you.

452
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:36,999
One person died.

453
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:46,967
Oh, my...

454
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:57,812
Are you done?

455
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:59,480
Yeah. Just finished.

456
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,651
Did the patient survive?

457
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:04,652
For now.

458
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,657
But you...

459
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:11,742
I don't have a light.

460
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:17,915
I'm asking if you're okay.

461
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:28,634
Oh, dear. Why even ask?

462
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:34,849
What kind of doctor smokes? Quit.

463
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:52,700
Doctor.

464
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,034
Nurse.

465
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:57,371
Watch out!

466
00:40:57,997 --> 00:40:58,873
Seriously.

467
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:00,791
Nurse!

468
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:12,553
I'm telling you to bring a doctor.
Why don't you understand?

469
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:13,721
You can't.

470
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:15,181
This...

471
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,474
What's going on?

472
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:18,767
He's...

473
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:21,604
Oh, yes. I can finally communicate.

474
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,606
You know me, right?

475
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:26,650
Jin Young-soo, chief manager
of the power plant.

476
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:28,110
And?

477
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:31,989
I've been on my feet all day long,
so my blood sugar dropped.

478
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:34,909
I am so dizzy.

479
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:39,830
I might die...

480
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:49,006
Can you give me Dextrose
or a vitamin shot?

481
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:50,841
Can you give me one?

482
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:53,344
Put in some garlic too.

483
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,596
I told him no.

484
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,223
Never mind. Go back to work.

485
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:58,807
Okay.

486
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:02,770
This is Miss B.

487
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:06,482
There's a patient
who's dying to have vitamins.

488
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:09,652
If there's a bored-to-death doctor,

489
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:12,321
please come and order it. Over.

490
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:16,617
Is that right?
What's the patient's condition?

491
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,619
He needs immediate attention to his eyes.

492
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:20,955
Only a blind person

493
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:24,124
wouldn't have noticed the situation
we're in here.

494
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,752
But he's saying that he's exhausted.

495
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:27,962
And he talks a lot.

496
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:30,839
He's full of bullshit.
I'm turning off. Over.

497
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:32,424
That's what I'm saying.

498
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:36,136
What is your name?

499
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:37,304
Han Ja-ae.

500
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:39,473
What did you say your name was?

501
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:40,683
"You"?

502
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:43,978
Did you just talk down to me?

503
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:46,730
I thought it would be okay
since you started first.

504
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:49,525
Since we've cleared up our names,
how old are you?

505
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:54,029
Wow, really.

506
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:56,824
You just wait and see--

507
00:42:56,907 --> 00:43:00,578
Yes, yes, yes, I'll wait and see.

508
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:02,162
Come on, Doctor Choi.

509
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:05,666
The sterilizer broke,
we have a lot of work.

510
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:07,334
-Let's go.
-You!

511
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:09,003
Hey, jeez!

512
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:10,045
Hey!

513
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,134
What do we do?

514
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:20,598
The food we have left isn't enough
for everyone.

515
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:24,184
After our battle for life,

516
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,103
it's now a battle for food.

517
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:30,149
Let's eat combat rations.

518
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,904
You know my pay has been cut.

519
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:25,454
Squad One, come out and hand out rations.

520
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:40,803
As you were. Listen while you eat.

521
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:42,137
Rest.

522
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:45,391
Good work tonight.

523
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:49,395
Headquarters informed your families of
your status, so do not worry.

524
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:53,315
Once communication is back up,
we'll let you make video calls.

525
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:54,650
Please wait for now.

526
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:58,112
-Yes, I understand.
-Yes, I understand.

527
00:44:59,905 --> 00:45:02,241
We will continue to dispatch
rescue teams tomorrow.

528
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:04,243
The work will be hard.

529
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:07,162
So after your dinner,
go to sleep immediately.

530
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:12,501
Try not to think too much about
the situation and what happened today.

531
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:16,004
Just clear your head.

532
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:20,551
You guys only need to follow
orders well.

533
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:26,056
I will always give you the right orders.

534
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:28,434
Understand?

535
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:30,853
Yes, we understand.

536
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:33,689
End of roll call.

537
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:14,313
Was coming here your will
or my father's order?

538
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:19,818
The responsibility of the commanders is

539
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:22,446
to send the best forces
to the most dangerous places.

540
00:46:24,656 --> 00:46:26,658
I don't know why you're taking sides.

541
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:29,828
I also don't like it.

542
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:31,622
Please call him.

543
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:33,081
He must be worried.

544
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:39,463
How about you?

545
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:44,593
What if I was injured?

546
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:54,895
I would have regretted... 

547
00:46:57,022 --> 00:46:59,024
all the times I ran away from you.

548
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:05,989
So you're just going to stand there?

549
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,460
Move.

550
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:01,587
This is my work.

551
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:03,881
I'll do your work so move.

552
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:12,931
Its so uncomfortable
without the sterilizer.

553
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:14,766
Are you really not scared?

554
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:17,269
What did I say?

555
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:20,105
We should have run away
as soon as we arrived.

556
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:24,359
I should've had kids,
they'd be the perfect excuse.

557
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:27,029
Why haven't you made any babies
after all these years?

558
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:28,030
What about you?

559
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:36,079
Repeat this, "1-0-3-0."

560
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:38,874
One, zero, three, zero. What is that?

561
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:40,375
My laptop password.

562
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:44,796
If I die here, open the "C" drive.

563
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,592
Under the hospital documents,
there's a folder, "brown-eared bulbul."

564
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:52,262
Please delete that folder.
I am asking you for a favor as a friend.

565
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:53,889
What is in there...

566
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:58,644
Dirty! Delete it immediately!

567
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:01,980
-It's worse than you imagine.
-No!

568
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:04,149
That's why you have to do it yourself.

569
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:07,736
You pervert!
1-0-3-0 means teens to 30's?

570
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:08,987
Delete it immediately!

571
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:11,239
I can't, until I die.

572
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:12,699
Oh, my goodness.

573
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:14,952
Let's turn it off and go in.

574
00:49:15,702 --> 00:49:16,703
It is all done.

575
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:20,290
I am telling you to erase it.

576
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:22,709
Hey!

577
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:26,296
You're so dirty!

578
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:29,174
Is he conscious?

579
00:49:29,257 --> 00:49:31,760
Not yet. We need to wait till tomorrow.

580
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:41,561
Is this the patient
we operated on outside?

581
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:42,980
He is conscious.

582
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:51,947
He is getting better.

583
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:53,907
Check his vitals every three hours.

584
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,578
It's a tibial fracture.

585
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:03,166
Since she's pregnant, it was set without
anesthesia. It must've been hurt a lot.

586
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:04,584
Your baby is brave.

587
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:08,839
Isn't that your phone?

588
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:11,925
My classical playlist, for the baby.

589
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:16,263
You've truly become a doctor,
as well as a father.

590
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:24,438
He has a classical playlist?

591
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:51,798
I wore them well.

592
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:55,135
Thank you.

593
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:06,354
18 DEAD
41 INJURED

594
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:28,126
STATUS OF POWER PLANT RESCUE SITE

595
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:32,756
UNIDENTIFIED BODIES

596
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:29,813
Be careful.

597
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:46,830
You rascal, you can't hide from me.

598
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:49,166
Let go and talk instead.

599
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:53,170
Doctor. You worked hard today.

600
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:37,505
Solidarity.

601
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:40,926
Is there anything you need?

602
00:53:41,843 --> 00:53:43,887
I'm just looking around. Don't mind me.

603
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:47,098
Did you hurt your shoulder?

604
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:52,312
-Can you take a look at it?
-Yes.

605
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:01,988
You endured this?
I think you need stitches.

606
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,449
No wonder. It hurt a lot.

607
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:08,036
-I will call the medical team.
-No, I can go.

608
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:09,913
Please come this way.

609
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:23,510
How did this happen?

610
00:54:26,888 --> 00:54:28,807
It happen when
I was rescuing in the ruins.

611
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:37,691
I am okay.

612
00:54:41,486 --> 00:54:42,612
Did you hear that?

613
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:45,490
I asked that silently.

614
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:49,744
Yes, loudly.

615
00:54:57,294 --> 00:55:01,047
I'm glad you are here on the scene.

616
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:09,514
I'm thankful that you fought here with me.

617
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:17,522
You too, Captain.

618
00:55:25,196 --> 00:55:27,991
Earlier when I spoke harshly to you...

619
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:29,284
I know.

620
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:33,413
You know?

621
00:55:33,788 --> 00:55:35,957
Do you know how many years
I've been a doctor?

622
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:42,005
Doctors see more deaths
in the operating room

623
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:44,090
than soldiers in disasters.

624
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:50,555
If my words of comfort were too clumsy,
I'll stop.

625
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:57,979
I want you to be okay.

626
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:01,149
I mean it.

627
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:11,951
Then instead of clumsy words of comfort,

628
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:14,537
stick to what you're good at, Captain.

629
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:16,498
What I'm good at?

630
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:20,126
What are you talking about?

631
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:22,462
Joking.

632
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:27,592
I think what I need
the most now is a joke.

633
00:56:31,971 --> 00:56:33,848
You are really pretty right now.

634
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:37,602
You can't even see me.

635
00:56:37,685 --> 00:56:39,312
I saw you earlier.

636
00:56:41,022 --> 00:56:42,273
You'll always be pretty.

637
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:46,361
I asked for a joke.

638
00:56:46,444 --> 00:56:47,737
It was a joke.

639
00:56:55,954 --> 00:56:57,372
I really missed you.

640
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:02,794
Whatever I did...

641
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:06,965
I kept thinking of you.

642
00:57:14,347 --> 00:57:16,224
I physically exhausted myself,

643
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:18,393
I tried hard,

644
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,730
I drank, and tried everything.

645
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:28,069
Even then, I still missed you.

646
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:40,415
It was unexpected.

647
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,378
Then think about it.

648
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:48,256
This isn't a joke.

649
00:58:37,972 --> 00:58:42,060
Do you risk your life every time?

650
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:43,770
I'm a man who is good at his work.

651
00:58:44,562 --> 00:58:47,482
And part of my job is not getting killed.

652
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:49,067
How's the inside?

653
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:50,568
It can collapse at any time.

654
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:53,071
It's the aftershock! Get out!

655
00:58:53,446 --> 00:58:55,448
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry!

656
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:57,951
What's this noise?
Check the power plant immediately!

657
00:58:58,701 --> 00:58:59,911
What's happened?

658
00:59:00,745 --> 00:59:03,331
Big Boss. Big Boss!
Answer me if you hear this.

659
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:07,669
Getting ready to run at any given time.
Because I can't fall.

660
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:09,879
Is there anyone out there?

661
00:59:10,004 --> 00:59:12,632
There's a dead person here!

662
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:16,886
