00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:44,896
EPISODE 2

2
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,482
What are you doing here?

3
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,947
What? Is something there?

4
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,535
If you're in the special forces,

5
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,081
do you get picked up by helicopters
and get shot at by guns and everything?

6
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:06,251
Hey, why would a South Korean soldier
ever get shot with a gun?

7
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:08,419
They do get hit with rain and snow.

8
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:11,089
And they have to clean it up afterwards.

9
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:12,966
Right?

10
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:17,595
Then who is the guy that just flew away?

11
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:21,432
Did someone fly?
Did he "flee" or did he "fly"?

12
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,435
He must've been desperate to do that.

13
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,696
AFGHANISTAN-PAKISTAN BORDER
U.N. PEACEKEEPING CAMP

14
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,443
No!

15
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,336
Operation failure.
Our troops and allies are all dead.

16
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,796
The place is booby-trapped. Pay attention!

17
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:35,089
I'm sorry, sir!

18
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,232
If that's how it is,
I won't behave either.

19
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,236
Team Leader's gonna die!

20
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:41,114
He may die or he may kill.

21
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:46,369
When the special forces
of joint operations first meet each other,

22
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,205
they fight to assess each other's skills.

23
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:54,168
To see if they have the skills to have
your back in life-or-death battles.

24
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:58,172
This isn't sparring. It's a real match.

25
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,300
And it's not a fight
for you to butt in to.

26
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:09,660
Back when I was the youngest applicant,
I didn't know better so I wasn't nervous.

27
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,204
This time I am so nervous.

28
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:14,207
I don't remember the questions at all.
What do I do?

29
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:17,335
Stop, you're going to get it.
They can't fail you three times.

30
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:23,049
Right? The Director did say that I have
the highest score on the application.

31
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,517
Wow, Dr. Kim,
do you have a blind date today?

32
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:36,062
I had an interview.
I was the second person after her.

33
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:37,563
For real?

34
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:38,981
What is she?

35
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:44,237
Your interview go well?
He didn't ask you much, right?

36
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,531
Was he like that to you?

37
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:50,743
He must have thought
you wouldn't understand the questions.

38
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,621
Or there was no reason to ask questions.

39
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,833
I'm leaving. I have a surgery.

40
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,131
She's talking about
the professorship interview, right?

41
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,091
She failed the board exam three times!

42
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:06,467
Four times.

43
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,053
Do they have to fill a quota or something?

44
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:13,683
Let's start.

45
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,895
You can't even find
an operation room now?

46
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,440
-This is Professor Park's--
-He changed hands.

47
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:22,900
I'm the head surgeon now,

48
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,402
and you're my assistant.

49
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:27,822
What are you doing?

50
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:32,034
Respiration rate is 16.
No problems on the EKG.

51
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,995
Let's start. Scalpel.

52
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,879
I noticed that you put together
Professor Baek's article.

53
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:45,631
-I noticed that you got him a watch again.
-Right.

54
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:50,136
You try hard at every conference
to get on his good side.

55
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:53,264
That's what you try to do
by getting him a watch.

56
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:54,932
My skill speaks for itself.

57
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,772
What are you doing right now?
What did you touch?

58
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,593
It's a tension pneumothorax.
We need needle decompression.

59
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:31,636
A 14-gauge needle.

60
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,471
I'm the surgeon in charge. I'll do it.

61
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,056
Then hurry up and do it.

62
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,059
Give me a 14-gauge needle.

63
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,943
What are you doing? 28-chest tube, now!

64
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:48,486
28-french...

65
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:04,520
Ten Joules charge.

66
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,148
-Charged.
-Clear. Shoot.

67
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,288
-Thirty Joules charge.
-Charged. Shoot.

68
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,454
MILITANT GROUPS

69
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:48,749
Blood pressure and pulse are all normal.

70
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,168
The patient is stable now.

71
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:52,878
You finish up.

72
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:55,840
I'm going to.

73
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,430
If your hands are slow, practice!

74
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,348
If you're a scatter-brain,
know your place!

75
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,684
Why is she being so fucking ambitious?

76
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,856
It was really nerve-racking earlier.

77
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,234
You've worked really hard today.

78
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:17,111
You too.

79
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,035
You've worked hard too.

80
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:30,040
But what happened to your mom?
Is she still a single mom?

81
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,000
Nope.

82
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:34,962
Ta-da!

83
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:39,967
Look at you, so happy.

84
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,344
Seriously, you guys.

85
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:44,597
He proposed to you?

86
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,224
Yes. We got matching rings first.

87
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:51,979
Oh! Honey!

88
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,149
Honey.

89
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,651
Did the surgery go well?

90
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,112
How ridiculously sweet.

91
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,866
I heard you had
something to tell me in private.

92
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:04,784
What?

93
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:09,955
Oh! I do! Can you please excuse us?

94
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,415
What is it about?

95
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,292
About a patient.

96
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:17,338
About keeping patient information
private between doctors.

97
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,631
Something like that.

98
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,634
Okay, good luck!

99
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,512
-See you later, Honey.
-Bye, Honey. See you later.

100
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:31,310
What is it this time?

101
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:32,770
I lost my ring.

102
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,774
I definitely put it in my pocket
before the morning surgery,

103
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:37,858
but it's not there!

104
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,194
You're really pathetic, Lee Chi-hoon.

105
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:42,404
It can't be inside the patient's stomach.

106
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,156
What? You are crazy!

107
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,701
I found it!
It was inside my scrub pocket.

108
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,081
Stand up.

109
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,416
Clench your jaws.

110
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:06,345
But they were always at the hospital.
When did they make a baby?

111
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,847
The hospital is a big place.

112
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:11,642
Oh my, that's dirty.

113
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,269
Here, open.

114
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,652
What about that guy? Did he call?

115
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:23,362
Nope.

116
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:28,033
I guess he's not the type to call often.

117
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:30,995
What is he exactly?

118
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,956
Soldier, gunshot wound, helicopter...

119
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,292
Is he a spy?

120
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:38,711
Is he?

121
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,547
What are you looking at?

122
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,300
That guy's picture.

123
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,637
This is the only picture I have of him.

124
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,517
Dear... you're crazy.

125
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,863
TWO U.N. HOSTAGES IN AFGHANISTAN
SAFELY RESCUED

126
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,408
Have you eaten yet?
I'm still clenching my jaws.

127
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:10,367
Loosen them.

128
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:15,080
I'm off today so don't call or message me.
I'm not going to answer.

129
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,248
What are you up to?

130
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,959
A date.

131
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,211
You're not going looking like that, right?

132
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,463
You shouldn't!

133
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,360
How have you been?

134
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,615
Why are you here already?

135
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:53,702
There are two hours left till our date.
I'm not mistaken, right?

136
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,538
I came really early.

137
00:15:57,414 --> 00:16:00,668
It was pretty nice
to have someone to wait for.

138
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,712
Still, how can you come two hours early?

139
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,677
Why are you avoiding my eyes?

140
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,470
It's because my confidence is low.

141
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:13,764
I have no makeup on right now.

142
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,309
I was gonna go home to wash
my hair and change my clothes.

143
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:20,145
You're already beautiful.

144
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:21,605
Really?

145
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,943
How come?
Is it because my inner self is beautiful?

146
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:29,113
You don't mind? Should I not wash up?

147
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:30,531
Get in. I'll give you a ride.

148
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,075
So you do mind.

149
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,796
Come in. My house is clean.
I don't have time to dirty it.

150
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,927
I'm just going to wash my hair.

151
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:57,641
By the way, I didn't eat at all today,
so I'm really hungry.

152
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,560
Can we order food and eat together?

153
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,689
I was going to buy you something better.

154
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:05,524
You're okay with takeout?

155
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,610
It's okay, I'm sharing it
with an amazing person.

156
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,696
The fliers are on the fridge.

157
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:11,822
Thanks!

158
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,035
What do you like?

159
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,453
Stone pot bibimbap!

160
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:21,790
She's so weird.

161
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:23,959
And so pretty.

162
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,462
Yes, street number 964.

163
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,005
Thank you.

164
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,434
TO DO LIST

165
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,571
NOTICE OF TEMPORARY WATER SHUTDOWN

166
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:10,839
What's going on?

167
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:12,132
Wait.

168
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:13,383
Why?

169
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,135
What do you want me to do?

170
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,430
I haven't rinsed off the shampoo yet.

171
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:23,477
That was refreshing.
Now I feel like I can live.

172
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,271
Did you order the food?

173
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:32,820
-Why are you looking at me like that?
-Did you wash your hair?

174
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:37,491
There was a water shutdown at 16:00.

175
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,880
That water must be cold.
Want me to boil it?

176
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,006
Don't worry about it!

177
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,853
So, I'm just curious--

178
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:06,979
Don't be.

179
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,231
You know what I'm gonna ask?

180
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:12,025
You want to make fun of me.
It's written all over your face.

181
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,945
Where? It's just a handsome face.

182
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,740
So, what were you gonna ask?

183
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:23,829
Did you think of me?

184
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:25,998
Of course, I did.

185
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:27,916
How about you?

186
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:31,795
I did, a lot.

187
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:33,755
Like a man.

188
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:41,471
Thank you for letting go
of the hair situation.

189
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,349
Let's get coffee
when we go to the theater.

190
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,309
Sure.

191
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:49,146
Ah, right. I should get a bottled water.

192
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:50,606
Hey!

193
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:06,538
Whenever I come to the movie theater,
this is when I get most excited.

194
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,415
Right before the lights turn off.

195
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,921
This is the most exciting moment
of my life.

196
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,299
Being with a beautiful lady
right before the lights turn off.

197
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:20,135
Not an elder?

198
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,972
I mistook you for a beautiful lady
because it's dark.

199
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,649
Earlier you said "hey" to me, right?

200
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:35,776
So what?

201
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:40,822
How old are you?
You probably know my age from the chart.

202
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:46,036
Well, earlier,
you teased me first like an older brother.

203
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:53,335
So I'm older.

204
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,545
Just kidding.

205
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:57,422
I'm older.

206
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:58,507
I don't think you are.

207
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:00,759
Show me your I.D..

208
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,553
I was worried you might not be of age.

209
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,196
Solidarity!

210
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:23,949
Captain Yoo Si-jin.

211
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:26,743
Yes, that is correct.

212
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:29,663
Yes, I understand.

213
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,540
Solidarity.

214
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,419
Is something wrong?

215
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,045
I have to go.

216
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:38,297
Right now?

217
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:39,756
Yes.

218
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:42,134
I'm sorry.

219
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:47,014
Am I getting blown off again?

220
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:51,476
I'm really sorry.

221
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,854
Let's see this movie together next time.

222
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:55,022
For now, let's leave.

223
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,774
No. I'll just watch. You can go ahead.

224
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:02,195
-No, let's watch together--
-It's okay. You can go.

225
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,120
I'll call you.

226
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:27,637
It's me.
I really didn't want to call but...

227
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:40,317
Did you call?

228
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:41,860
How could I not?

229
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:46,490
This time, everything really seemed
to point at her getting the position.

230
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:50,660
This time, everything pointed at
Kim Eun-ji getting the position.

231
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,581
But this time, it's not even a senior,
but a classmate.

232
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:57,292
Kang Mo-yeon will be upset.

233
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:01,713
Doctor Kang pretty much lived
inside the operating room.

234
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,465
That's why it's pitiful.

235
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:06,718
Why live inside the OR?
Live in a greenhouse, like a flower.

236
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:10,430
I heard that Kim Eun-ji’s family is
a major shareholder of Haesung Group.

237
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:11,723
Dr. Kang stood no chance.

238
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,433
How does that make sense?

239
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,143
Doctors need skills.

240
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:18,146
Says who? Skills can't get you far.

241
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,191
Wealth is what makes doctors.
And then it's fitness.

242
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:23,735
So, are you happy with this?

243
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:27,239
I'm just saying this is wrong.

244
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:29,866
You said that it would be me.

245
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,327
You told me yourself
that it would be me this time.

246
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,414
This is already my third time applying.

247
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:37,666
The first time, you said I was too young.

248
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:41,545
The second time, you chose my seniors
who helped you with your paper.

249
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:42,629
Listen!

250
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:45,549
Do I owe you a professorship or something?

251
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:50,554
If you put it that way,
I have nothing more to say.

252
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:53,640
I know that having connections matters.

253
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:55,559
So who will it be next time?

254
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:58,562
The Minister's son-in-law?
Hospital owner's nephew?

255
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:03,525
Shouldn't skills be honored
at least once out of the three tries?

256
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:07,487
It seems you don't want
a fourth chance, Dr. Kang.

257
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:08,405
Director Shim!

258
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:15,036
Dr. Kim, we're done here.

259
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,999
Hand over your broadcast materials
to Dr. Kang and come to Park's office.

260
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,793
Let's go together in Professor Park's car.

261
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,920
Yes, I'll be right there.

262
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:25,964
-Director!
-Hey!

263
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:30,886
You have to fill in
for my broadcast tomorrow.

264
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,804
I get to eat dinner with the professors.

265
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,141
You want me to be your substitute?

266
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:37,309
Of course.

267
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:39,352
You have to if a Professor tells you to.

268
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,397
Don't make mistakes because it's live.

269
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:44,149
Memorize everything.

270
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:47,486
Our hospital spent
a lot of money on this product placement.

271
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,531
What if I say no?

272
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:53,909
Then don't do it
and we'll see what happens.

273
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:57,245
Dinner's tonight and the broadcast
is not until tomorrow. Why me?

274
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,414
Because I'm drinking tonight

275
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:01,666
to celebrate the professorship.

276
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,418
How could I get up early tomorrow?

277
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:06,713
You are really horrible.

278
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:09,174
Aren't you ashamed?
Aren't you embarrassed?

279
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:10,884
Hmm, you're right.

280
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:13,553
But at least
I got a professorship out of it.

281
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:15,847
You just get embarrassment
and nothing more.

282
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:19,601
-Bitch.
-What?

283
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,394
You heard me.
I said you're a bitch.

284
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:24,105
I pity those
whose lives are in your hands!

285
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,192
Stop messing around with me!

286
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:29,319
You know this is embarrassing.

287
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:30,987
That makes me even more angry!

288
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,241
-You!
-Hey!

289
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:35,617
Let go!

290
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,619
-Let go!
-You let go first!

291
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:40,830
I'll do everything to prevent you
from becoming a professor!

292
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:42,541
Are you crazy? Hurry up and let go!

293
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,251
-You let go first!
-Let go!

294
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:46,294
-Seriously!
-Hey!

295
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,422
Hey, hey!

296
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:52,884
Why are you grabbing each other's hair
in the director's room?

297
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,553
Let go, right now!

298
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,933
What am I doing right now?

299
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,352
I must be crazy.

300
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:11,278
If a patient is suspected to have
an arrhythmia...

301
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:22,122
If a patient is suspected to have
an arrhythmia,

302
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:25,458
a 12-lead EKG should be--

303
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:27,794
Why can't I memorize it?

304
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:37,554
If a patient is suspected to have
an arrhythmia--

305
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:54,738
If a patient is suspected to have
an arrhythmia, a 12-lead EKG...

306
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:00,785
-Good work.
-Thank you, sir.

307
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,912
Check all the equipment before roll call.

308
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,497
Yes, sir.

309
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:10,545
-Unit, attention!
-That's fine. At ease.

310
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:11,630
Parade rest.

311
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:15,133
Good job going in place of the Bravo unit.

312
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:18,720
Did anyone get hurt?

313
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:22,098
No, sir.
Everyone returned without injury.

314
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:24,059
Thanks.

315
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:29,814
Alpha Team has worked hard
on many missions at home and abroad.

316
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:33,693
As commander, I've decided to give
the 8-month extended leave...

317
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:36,112
to the Alpha Team.

318
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:42,661
May we know where?

319
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,120
Taebaek Unit in Uruk.

320
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:48,792
Training begins in two weeks, use this
time to see your families and loved ones.

321
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:55,173
Now, pack up and leave the base quickly.

322
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:56,633
Dismissed.

323
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:59,010
Solidarity.

324
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:05,809
Why are they giving us
such a long leave?

325
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:08,812
Because we get attached to
a regular unit for our leave.

326
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:11,940
We are technically resting
because there are no urgent tasks.

327
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:17,028
-Yes!
-Yes!

328
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,917
Is Dr. Kang Mo-yeon in surgery?

329
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:33,294
She's not answering her phone.

330
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:36,381
Dr. Kang is over there.

331
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,341
She's in a live broadcast.

332
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:41,094
Arrhythmia can be classified
into different categories.

333
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:43,513
The onset rate increases as people age.

334
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:47,726
Then what kind of treatments are available
for patients with an arrhythmia?

335
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:50,895
There's a new EPS method that's being
newly implemented

336
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:53,982
for the treatment
and diagnosis of arrhythmias

337
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:55,859
that minimizes side effects.

338
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:56,818
Oh, I see.

339
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:59,904
You don't look nervous at all
for it being your first time here!

340
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:02,198
Your explanations are
easy to understand too.

341
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:05,160
I'm actually really nervous,
but I guess it doesn't show.

342
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,699
I'm sorry for the other day.

343
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,161
For leaving you alone like that.

344
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:53,958
I don't want to hear an apology,
I want to hear an explanation.

345
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:57,962
Where did you go this time?

346
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,548
Did you go in a helicopter again?

347
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:02,926
No.

348
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:04,636
I didn't go far.

349
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:10,016
I can't tell you the details
because of the rules...

350
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:12,685
I see.

351
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,605
You're not a spy, are you?

352
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,532
I was having a rough day...

353
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,495
and you popped up here and there.

354
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,708
Where did the man I was attracted to go?

355
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:38,461
What does he do?

356
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:42,924
But you're telling me that...

357
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:47,387
I can't even hear your story
when I see you

358
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:48,680
because of the rules.

359
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:53,852
I'm sorry.

360
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:57,814
Is it Special Forces
or something like that?

361
00:30:58,481 --> 00:30:59,524
Something like that.

362
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:02,110
You told me you shovel at the unit.

363
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:08,324
The fact that you have
a gunshot wound means you got shot.

364
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:13,955
Then does that mean
you also shoot guns?

365
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:16,875
So...

366
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:20,545
you might have to kill someone,

367
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,256
or get killed yourself...

368
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:27,510
in the type of work you do.

369
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:34,392
Do you only fight the bad guys?

370
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:44,777
Every day, I spend more than 12 hours in
the operating room...

371
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:48,489
trying to save people from dying.

372
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:51,284
That's what I do.

373
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,745
Fighting to save lives.

374
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:57,457
But your fights...

375
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:02,879
are about saving lives
through the deaths of others.

376
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:13,640
I'm a soldier.

377
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:16,517
A soldier...

378
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,770
follows orders.

379
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:26,444
At times,
what I believe to be the right thing...

380
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:30,073
may mean something different
to someone else.

381
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:34,744
Still, I try my best to carry out
my mission.

382
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:40,124
Until now,

383
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:46,464
I have lost three comrades
during military operations.

384
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,679
My comrades and I do this job...

385
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,974
because someone must do it.

386
00:32:57,225 --> 00:33:00,561
Me and my family,
you and your family,

387
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:04,232
and the loved ones
of those family members...

388
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:09,821
I believe that my job protects...

389
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:13,908
the freedom and peace of this land
where these people live.

390
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:20,790
I am a doctor.

391
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:23,918
There is dignity in life,

392
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:27,672
and no other value
or ideology should take precedence.

393
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:34,387
I see.

394
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,353
I'm sorry,

395
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:46,899
but this was not as I expected.

396
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:51,821
I understand.

397
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:53,906
I will get going.

398
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:56,200
It was nice meeting you.

399
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:02,206
Good bye.

400
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:53,966
Why are you back already?

401
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,802
I could ask you the same question.

402
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:58,054
You'll leave without seeing Myeong-ju?

403
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,307
If you go now, you won't see her
for six months.

404
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,477
Did you meet the doctor?

405
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:07,438
Please hand me the razor there.

406
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:18,032
Sergeant Gong says that Uruk has
a lot of beautiful women.

407
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:22,578
Kim Tae-hees working the fields
and Sistars picking grapes.

408
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:32,630
-Many a great man!
-Many a great man!

409
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:35,591
Many a great man there are

410
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:37,343
TAEBAEK DIVISION, URUK

411
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:42,265
But I am the greatest man of all

412
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:45,143
In a fight, I'm invincible

413
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:47,895
In love, I'm passionate

414
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,439
I am the man!

415
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:53,442
The greatest man!

416
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:54,986
Left foot!

417
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:56,404
Left foot!

418
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:57,405
One!

419
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:59,282
EIGHT MONTHS LATER

420
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:34,150
Were you taking a nap?

421
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:38,821
I was reflecting upon
the duty of a soldier to keep peace.

422
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:43,367
Would you like some iced coffee?

423
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:46,412
I prefer water.

424
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:49,999
Piccolo transmitting.

425
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:53,044
Suspicious explosive in zone B4.

426
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:55,504
It's an 82 mm blank ammunition
used by the enemy.

427
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:58,549
A Russian explosive
used by North Uruk during the border war.

428
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,593
All fuses seem to be active.

429
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:03,095
Its got a big casualty radius.
We should be careful.

430
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:07,642
Basic procedure completed.

431
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:09,227
What should I do?

432
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,520
If we report to the commander,

433
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:14,690
he'll tell us not to touch it and
get assistance from the U.S. Army.

434
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:17,902
Sergeant Choi Wu-geun.

435
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:20,446
What is my creed for service?

436
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,492
"Keep it down and don't cause trouble.

437
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:26,994
Don't do anything difficult."

438
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:29,247
Sergeant Im Gwang-nam.

439
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,540
What is difficult work?

440
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:34,794
First, requesting assistance.
Second, requesting assistance.

441
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:36,671
Third, requesting assistance.

442
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:40,591
We'll let the U.S. forces protect
world peace

443
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:42,593
and handle this on our own.

444
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:46,305
All responsibility will be taken
by your on-site commander...

445
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:48,766
me.

446
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:51,644
URUK TAEBAEK DIVISION HQ

447
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:53,229
Who was it? Which bastard was it?

448
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:57,775
Does living away from the HQ make
you think

449
00:37:57,858 --> 00:38:00,820
the commands of your superior
sound like a barking dog?

450
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,655
I told you to remove the duds

451
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:05,157
and let the U.S. EOD deal
with the live explosives?

452
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:06,117
Who was it?

453
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:10,371
Who handled it this way?

454
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:13,833
The Deputy Leader...

455
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:16,168
did not stop me.

456
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:21,132
Why didn't you stop me?

457
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:24,343
You know how much I like writing
requests for assistance.

458
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:26,220
How could you?

459
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:32,101
I really thought
that it was being written.

460
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:34,020
Why? Because...

461
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,273
he is good at writing.

462
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:41,610
The Tolstoy of requests for assistance.
Master writer Seo Dae-yeong.

463
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:47,950
These bastards...
Both of you pack your gear!

464
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:55,875
Born as the gallant sons of the nation.

465
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,627
They're here!

466
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,839
On that rewarding path
To protect our homeland.

467
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:04,759
Together we rise
In the fire of our youth

468
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:06,302
Attention! Go!

469
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:08,304
Good job!

470
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,183
Good luck!

471
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:25,946
Isn't it better to do physical labor
than to write a report?

472
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:29,116
Do you want me to show you
real physical labor?

473
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:33,579
No one can break our camaraderie

474
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:39,335
For we are the shields
Until the end of the day.

475
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,216
She is always chic.

476
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:48,969
Then the most realistic prevention must be
a check-up, right?

477
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,429
BODY CHECK
WITH KANG MO-YEON

478
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:55,184
Among the programs is something called
a carotid ultrasound.

479
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:09,407
Sungjin Group's President Choi had
some porridge today,

480
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,783
and he's looking good.

481
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:13,744
The mistress of Yooseong's CEO is
hospitalized again.

482
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:16,747
Again? Why?
She left the hospital yesterday.

483
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:18,874
His wife came and kicked her out.

484
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:24,046
These people can't differentiate
between a hospital and a hotel.

485
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:27,508
Let's go to see our annoying VIPs.

486
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:33,139
The cases I'm working on at
the law firm have been so stressful,

487
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:35,141
so I'm falling apart everywhere.

488
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:37,309
But of all my problems...

489
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:40,229
this is the most urgent.

490
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:42,440
My new girlfriend...

491
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:46,068
I don't know if it's because she is young.
But it's rough.

492
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:48,237
Then meet an older girl.

493
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,030
That's not what I make the money for.

494
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:53,701
What about that thing last time?

495
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:54,618
Oh, yes.

496
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:59,039
He is your biological grandson, Chairman.

497
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,041
Is that right?

498
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:03,752
Then...

499
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:06,505
please check this one too.

500
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:09,884
Okay.

501
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:18,350
I'd like a turkey, ham, and seafood
club sandwich platter, to go.

502
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:20,478
And the chocolate chip cookies too.

503
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:23,731
-Any vegetables that you don't want?
-I'll have them all, please.

504
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,107
Honey oat for the bread.

505
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:28,819
By the way, you are prettier in person
than on television.

506
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:31,155
Do you want it toasted?

507
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:32,823
Yes. Thank you.

508
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:35,159
Well, well...

509
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:36,952
Who do we have here?

510
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:40,122
The VIP ward specialist has graced us
in the general ward!

511
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:42,917
It is Professor Kang Mo-yeon!

512
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:46,587
I increased your workload, didn't I?

513
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:49,965
Here's a bribe.
I added olives to yours, Nurse Min-ji.

514
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:51,300
Thank you.

515
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:54,678
You really never know in life.

516
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:57,806
You never got a chance to bloom in
the operating room.

517
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,558
But with a mic instead of a scalpel,

518
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:02,895
you've become the face of the Hospital
and a professor in the VIP ward!

519
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:04,271
Ham for me.

520
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,649
It's also very fascinating to me.

521
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:07,816
Who knew?

522
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,319
Life can take a wild turn at any moment.

523
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:19,411
I checked the bulletin board
of the broadcasting station.

524
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:23,541
Someone said you were just as pretty
as the reporter on the show.

525
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:25,292
Did you write that yourself?

526
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:26,502
I didn't write that.

527
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:30,422
If you didn't,
don't you want to know who wrote it?

528
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:33,217
The ID was cock-a-doodle-do Song.

529
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:35,844
Cock-a-doodle-do Song?

530
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:39,515
Oh, Doctor Song!

531
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:43,727
Did you really write that?
I can't believe it.

532
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:46,272
Eat all you want!

533
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:49,066
Look at her all happy.

534
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:50,693
She should be ashamed.

535
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:53,237
And she's probably telling people
she's a doctor.

536
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:01,036
-What are you looking at?
-You.

537
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:04,290
You aren't a doctor either.
You're just your father's daughter.

538
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:09,003
Hey! A true doctor should be in
the operating room.

539
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:10,212
Not in a makeup room.

540
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:12,381
That makes two of us not in the OR then.

541
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:15,718
-I'm too busy and you don't have skill.
-Stop bragging.

542
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:17,886
You only got it as my substitute.

543
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:20,556
-You stop.
-You were dropped the moment I went in.

544
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:24,059
You think you're the best.
You act like you own the entire world.

545
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:27,062
How could I own the entire world?

546
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:30,316
I'm just taking back
the nameplate you took away.

547
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:33,152
So don't mind me
and just get back to work.

548
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:36,572
-I'll get going.
-Bye.

549
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:38,824
Hey, hey.

550
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:41,535
So annoying.

551
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:00,763
I'll come back healthy.

552
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:03,223
Let's watch a movie together.

553
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:06,852
Hurry. I don't have much time.

554
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:09,188
Is that a yes or a no?

555
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,691
Did you think of me?

556
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:16,820
Of course. How about you?

557
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,447
I did, a lot.

558
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:19,907
Like a man.

559
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:25,496
This is our first date,
so I'm setting the mood.

560
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:26,622
I'll put it here.

561
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,666
-Why not the middle--
-Wait!

562
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:31,669
For a woman,
it's all about the back-light.

563
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:33,671
I look prettier this way.

564
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:35,798
Please don't move it.

565
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:38,509
It's placed with your line of sight
and angle in mind.

566
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:45,265
You got hurt again.

567
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,851
Did you get hurt from shoveling again?

568
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:55,609
What are the chances of getting
a facial injury from shoveling?

569
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:57,945
So it's not from that, is it?

570
00:44:58,404 --> 00:44:59,905
And yet, I pulled it off.

571
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:11,709
You must be so busy
if you don't have time to wash your hair?

572
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:14,920
I pretty much live in the operating room.

573
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,007
Do you know how sexy I am in the OR?

574
00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:24,179
Even though you can only see this part,
I am super pretty.

575
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:28,809
I want to date that person.

576
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:30,728
I guess she's not here today.

577
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:32,938
Seriously!

578
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:46,994
I don't have time to be sexy these days.

579
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:57,379
What are you doing?

580
00:45:58,881 --> 00:45:59,882
Solidarity!

581
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:01,925
Private First Class, Kim Gi-beom.

582
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:03,510
I am digging out a drain.

583
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:04,845
I know that.

584
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:10,517
Give it to me.

585
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:18,066
If you hold it like that,
it'll take you all night and more.

586
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:19,401
Look.

587
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:22,780
Hold it like this,
using your waist and shoulders.

588
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:24,239
Like this.

589
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:30,662
That's why I was cautious.

590
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:33,540
Oh, you're bleeding!

591
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:36,543
I actually got hurt shoveling.

592
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:39,213
Please stay still.
It looks like you need first aid.

593
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:42,925
What the...

594
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:45,677
HURT WHILE SHOVELING

595
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:46,720
Attention.

596
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,097
Parade rest.

597
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:50,849
Attention.

598
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:53,185
Is something wrong?

599
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:55,813
Why did you bring this idiot?
All the way out here?

600
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:57,481
He's precious in my eyes.

601
00:46:58,106 --> 00:46:59,316
What do you need?

602
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:01,652
I need wine and whipped cream.

603
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:04,154
It's Sergeant Gong's birthday,
so he's gonna cook steak.

604
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:05,781
Private Kim is a good cook.

605
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:08,367
Oh, it's today!

606
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:14,456
I will handle the task of procuring
the wine then.

607
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:33,517
-I come just for this.
-That was for me.

608
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:35,686
Please stop misunderstanding.

609
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,443
Did you get the one I asked for?

610
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:48,991
Be careful with that, kiddo.

611
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:53,495
It's pretty heavy.
Do you shoot it like this?

612
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:01,795
Did it scare you?

613
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:03,714
That worked well.

614
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:14,641
-Korean?
-Speaking Korean doesn't make you Korean.

615
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:18,979
Give it to me!

616
00:48:21,106 --> 00:48:23,108
A gun isn't a puppy
that knows its owner.

617
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:25,694
A bullet will fire
no matter where it's pointed.

618
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:33,160
Why are you buying a gun
you don't even know how to use?

619
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:35,162
I'm not buying it to kill someone.

620
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,165
I bought it to protect myself.

621
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:42,461
So arrogant.

622
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:49,343
Is it okay to let her just take it?

623
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:51,845
You have the right to bear arms here.

624
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:06,318
Uruk?

625
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:08,278
Where is Uruk?

626
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:10,906
It's a country located
at the tip of the Balkans.

627
00:49:10,989 --> 00:49:13,909
Haesung Group is building
an eco-friendly power station there.

628
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:15,953
It's volunteering.

629
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:19,289
But they'll fill it with people
with no money or connections.

630
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:21,625
Wait, that's me.

631
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:24,920
I have no money, no power, no fortune.
Great.

632
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:27,339
You're friendly
and not bad-looking, though.

633
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:31,635
I am?

634
00:49:33,261 --> 00:49:35,180
I'm definitely gonna go volunteer.

635
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:38,141
-I got permission from Dr. Jang.
-Hey!

636
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:40,477
You can't go!
Dr. Jang is almost due!

637
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:43,855
There's no way she would've
knowingly given permission.

638
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:46,525
She said I won't have a chance
when the baby is born,

639
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:48,151
-so she told me to go.
-Oh my.

640
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:51,071
You have a rich family.
Why choose Schweitzer?

641
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:53,573
Life will be easier
if you chose to be Bill Gates.

642
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:54,491
Professor Kang.

643
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:02,833
Leave your schedule open this evening.

644
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:04,209
Let's get dinner.

645
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:14,344
Did I just get asked out by the chairman?

646
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:15,637
What to do!

647
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:17,764
I know, what do I do?

648
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:23,020
What does the rising star
Kang Mo-yeon need at this time?

649
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:25,397
-A fan club?
-An arranged marriage.

650
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:27,607
Arranged marriage!

651
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:30,235
That's not such a bad idea.

652
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:33,071
I disapprove.

653
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:35,240
He's a divorcee.

654
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:39,703
-You're so much better than that.
-How exactly is she better?

655
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:41,747
Is she young? Is your family wealthy?

656
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:45,834
For a woman with no appealing background,
a divorced man is an advantage.

657
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:46,918
Right?

658
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:52,215
Is this my chance to rise up
the societal ladder?

659
00:50:59,514 --> 00:51:00,974
What are you doing? Sit down.

660
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:05,353
Are we eating dinner here?

661
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:10,984
Do you think
we came here just for dinner?

662
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:13,070
You said it was the sky lounge.

663
00:51:13,779 --> 00:51:14,613
Sky.

664
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:16,073
Lounge.

665
00:51:16,823 --> 00:51:17,783
It's all here.

666
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:18,867
Do you need more?

667
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:23,246
Maybe manners?

668
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:24,831
Or...

669
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:26,917
I guess I was a fool for expecting it,

670
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:28,210
but romance?

671
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:32,631
-Are you that kind of a person?
-Are you this kind of a person?

672
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:35,300
Did you not hear
about my lack of patience?

673
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:39,429
We can order food.
You want to wash first while we wait?

674
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:42,140
Or should I first?

675
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:53,902
Good call. Come here.

676
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:02,119
What are you doing?

677
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:06,081
-Are you going to hit me?
-Yes.

678
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:09,376
You hit the chairman?

679
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:10,961
I almost killed him.

680
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:16,591
I won't get fired, right?
I am the star professor of this hospital.

681
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:18,468
And he's the chairman.

682
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:19,386
Right?

683
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:25,100
I have to go to the meeting.
How am I gonna face him?

684
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:29,104
Glare at him. Give him the death stare.

685
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:30,981
A glare can hurt people, you know.

686
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,734
What if he really starts liking me?

687
00:52:35,193 --> 00:52:36,695
That's my real concern.

688
00:52:37,028 --> 00:52:38,196
The next item...

689
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,281
Damn it!

690
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:41,950
is the Uruk medical service project.

691
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:45,328
I thought about accepting volunteers...

692
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:50,625
but I decided I want to send
the best doctor out to the field.

693
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:52,586
Professor Kang Mo-yeon...

694
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:57,257
will be the leader of the volunteer team.

695
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:02,053
It's not a hotel,
but you'll be given a clean accommodation.

696
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:04,097
You'll take it, won't you?

697
00:53:13,398 --> 00:53:14,774
You never know with life.

698
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:37,005
Have you seen
the list of the medical team?

699
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:39,507
Yes. I saw it.

700
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:43,803
Isn't the team leader that doctor?

701
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:46,056
Correct.

702
00:53:46,139 --> 00:53:48,016
Does she know that you're here?

703
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:49,643
Probably not.

704
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:52,562
I guess it wasn't just passing fate.

705
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:57,234
It must be brushing by as it's passing.

706
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:14,084
Why did they send me here?

707
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:17,963
They said that they arranged
some U.N. soldiers to come for us.

708
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:19,256
Let's wait a bit longer.

709
00:54:20,298 --> 00:54:21,258
We're waiting.

710
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:25,136
We're waiting, but this place is too hot.

711
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:29,307
You really never know with life.

712
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:31,768
We don't know.

713
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:34,980
Hello?

714
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:37,315
Yes, who is this?

715
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:40,360
Chairman? Chairman of what?

716
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:42,445
Han what?

717
00:54:43,905 --> 00:54:45,115
Han Seok-won.

718
00:54:46,324 --> 00:54:49,077
Dude, Han Seok-won is called Chairman Han.
Why would you--

719
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:53,456
Yes, Chairman.

720
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:56,209
My cellphone connection was bad.

721
00:54:58,920 --> 00:54:59,796
Yes!

722
00:55:00,338 --> 00:55:02,674
We just arrived at the Uruk Airport!

723
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:06,428
Yes, yes!
I'll give the phone to Team Leader Kang.

724
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:09,556
Why aren't you answering your phone?

725
00:55:17,605 --> 00:55:18,732
Kang Mo-yeon speaking.

726
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:20,025
It's really hot, isn't it?

727
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:22,527
If you've changed your mind,
you can tell me now.

728
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:25,697
I have a lot of excuses to bring
you back to Korea.

729
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:28,575
Forget it.

730
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:31,494
I knew you were an ass
when you brought me to the hotel,

731
00:55:32,203 --> 00:55:34,664
but I didn't know
you were a freaking coward too.

732
00:55:35,081 --> 00:55:36,291
Chairman, sir.

733
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:40,920
So let me tell you this.

734
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:44,341
With my fame on TV
and my networking with the VIP patients,

735
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:47,135
now seems to be the right time to open up
my own practice.

736
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:50,055
As soon as I return from this trip,

737
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:53,725
I'll throw a resignation letter in
your freaking face, so just you wait.

738
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:54,976
Do you understand?

739
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:06,780
You heard everything, right?

740
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,532
That is the reason I'm here.

741
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:16,998
The plane is coming.

742
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:31,674
It must be brushing by as it's passing.

743
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:07,919
I think they're dispatching
Liutentant Yoon.

744
00:59:08,002 --> 00:59:09,504
To here?

745
00:59:09,587 --> 00:59:10,505
Don't move.

746
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:12,549
What did I step on? A landmine?

747
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:14,384
How have you been?

748
00:59:14,467 --> 00:59:17,720
Are you still sexy in the operating room?

749
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:20,431
There was a car accident in
the mountain roads.

750
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:22,141
Hold on. I'll find you.

751
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:27,355
I'm sorry that my concern
got in the way of your work.

752
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:30,191
FP Level II announced in
the medical camp area.

753
00:59:30,858 --> 00:59:34,070
Our forces will not intervene.
If the patient dies...

754
00:59:34,153 --> 00:59:35,321
What's going on?

755
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:37,991
...we will blame it on the doctor.

756
00:59:39,284 --> 00:59:41,119
