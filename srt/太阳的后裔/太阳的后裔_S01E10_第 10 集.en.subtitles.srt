1
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:31,823
Save him.

2
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:35,577
As a doctor, it's your duty.

3
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:38,705
If a we have to kill him,

4
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:42,333
then it should be me who kills him.

5
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:06,274
It's shock caused by hemorrhaging.
We need to move him inside.

6
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:52,445
I forgot because I'm not a skilled doctor.

7
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,540
Wolf transmitting. Big Boss! Big Boss!

8
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:05,917
Do you hear me? Respond, Big Boss.

9
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:14,736
EPISODE 10

10
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,578
You're saying that Captain Argus
has hung up his uniform?

11
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:27,207
Yes. Now, he's an arms dealer.

12
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,960
I met him downtown once.

13
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:38,134
For us, civilian life is either
as a mercenary soldier or a criminal.

14
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,221
He's a special forces member
who hung up his uniform for money.

15
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:44,807
I guess it's just the natural progression.

16
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:58,905
They say that measles and cholera
occur after a disaster.

17
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,573
It's really true.

18
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:05,328
First, an unprecedented surgery,
then an earthquake,

19
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,871
now a contagious disease.

20
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,915
From the start, I said let's run away--

21
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,294
-Let's go.
-Bye.

22
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,838
Come over here. We're done.

23
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:18,508
The fever went down,
but we can't be too relieved yet.

24
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:21,219
In some, I see signs of pneumonia.

25
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,264
It's not too serious.

26
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,392
We've had enough training
to handle measles, too.

27
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,436
Go change your clothes.
Wash the blood from your hands, too.

28
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,230
Who's blood is that?

29
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,160
Save him.

30
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:49,122
As a doctor, it's your duty.

31
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:55,420
If we have to kill him,
it should be me that kills him.

32
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:24,490
Doctor Kang! You know the girl
you brought back?

33
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:27,201
She's saying that she's leaving.
What should I do?

34
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:33,726
So? Keep going.

35
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,396
So, we ran there and we saw
that the power plant

36
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,897
was buried halfway underground.

37
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,149
And the ground continued to shake.

38
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,652
The dump trucks were smashed
like beer cans.

39
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,863
The patients kept flowing in,
and mines kept blowing up.

40
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,698
It was such a mess.

41
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:52,120
Then, why are some people still there?

42
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:54,664
Well, everyone wanted to come,

43
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:58,334
but there are still patients there
and they lack medical staff.

44
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,838
Staying a few more days
may seem like nothing,

45
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,007
but for us who came back first,
we feel sorry for them.

46
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,804
I'm sorry to interrupt your conversation,

47
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:11,722
but why didn't Chi-hoon come back?

48
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:15,601
He was on the list of those who would
return, so why didn't he get on the plane?

49
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:21,899
There was a patient that urgently needed
to come to Korea, so he gave up his seat.

50
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,485
Oh, Lee Chi-hoon is a doctor now.

51
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,612
Is it really because of a patient?

52
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,573
He's not cheating on me is he?

53
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:32,535
I mean how can he not call even once?

54
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:35,288
Think about it carefully.

55
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:37,790
There was nothing weird going on?

56
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,168
Now that I look back on it, he was weird.

57
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:43,796
His illness aside,
did it seem like he was being chased?

58
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:46,382
Who?

59
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:49,302
That pesky fake patient
that snatched Dr. Lee's seat.

60
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:52,638
He made all that fuss to get a ticket,
but didn't get on the plane.

61
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:56,434
They couldn't find him,
so they left with one seat open.

62
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:59,520
-Unbelievable.
-Then, did he sit in that seat?

63
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,230
Who?

64
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,149
My soul.

65
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:11,407
I... like that side of Doctor Song.

66
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,992
I think he's very funny.

67
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,243
Nurse Choi.

68
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:15,453
Yes?

69
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:17,997
Me too.

70
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:21,459
It seems that it's already spreading
through the refugee camps.

71
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,587
The U.N. has already issued a warning
about measles as well.

72
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,214
I got the call from headquarters.

73
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:29,383
I packed enough MMR vaccines,
so don't worry.

74
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,844
There are more than 10 kids
left in the village.

75
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,723
-Wouldn't it be better if I went with you?
-Are you really a fool?

76
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:39,977
The person-in-charge of security
is Sergeant First Class Seo.

77
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:44,106
It's both a business and pleasure visit,
so civilians should stay out of it.

78
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,067
You've fallen hard.

79
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,528
You leave early in the morning, right?

80
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:50,821
Why are you so friendly?

81
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:51,948
I still have a grudge.

82
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:54,408
It seems I'm a more
honorable person than you.

83
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:57,036
Have a safe trip.

84
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,709
She's not scared
of the sister-in-law act anymore.

85
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:11,509
Wow, the weather is so nice.

86
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:15,680
The guy sitting next to me is even better.

87
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,642
What's so great about going with
an average looking soldier

88
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:20,893
to civil affairs?

89
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,104
It's because my standards are high.

90
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:26,107
Are you sure your standards are high?

91
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,026
Don't you look in the mirror
every morning?

92
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:34,115
If you're not going to look,
show me your handsome face every morning.

93
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:43,708
Have you ever thought about
what you'll do if you quit?

94
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,586
Are you talking about me?

95
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,004
I'm talking about me.

96
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:51,799
What are you talking about?

97
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:56,220
It's a dangerous job,
and we have to be apart most of the time.

98
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:01,892
Are you saying this for me?

99
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,686
Are you worried about me?

100
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,147
I'm worried about us.

101
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:11,319
It seems like I should be feeling
touched right now,

102
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:14,363
but I'm not.

103
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:17,700
I like the current
Sergeant First Class Seo Dae-yeong.

104
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:26,292
The Seo Dae-yeong I know is either
wearing a uniform or nothing at all.

105
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:29,045
Those are the only options.

106
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:33,341
Unless I take it off, nobody is touching
a button on the uniform.

107
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:59,367
It looks like no one is here.

108
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,370
The village is completely empty.

109
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:08,209
URUK TAEBAEK UNIT HEADQUARTERS

110
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:12,922
You should know who he is.
A U.S. Army deserter, Argus.

111
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,548
Now an illegal arms dealer.

112
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:17,051
I'm aware that he was there
in the operation

113
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,636
where we lost Captain Kim Jin-suk.

114
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,597
Yes, that's true.

115
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:35,486
The U.S. CIA has sent a request for
cooperation to our Senate Chief.

116
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:38,280
Is this a joint operation
against illegal firearms?

117
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:39,323
No.

118
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:43,327
This mission isn't about justice.
It's about politics.

119
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:48,749
This is North Uruk's current
second-in-command, Aman.

120
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,878
They want to start  a coup in North Uruk
and establish a Pro-U.S. government.

121
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,798
That's why through Argus,

122
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,676
they plan to sell large amounts
of firearms to Aman.

123
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,977
The Delta Force Captain is already
en route.

124
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,688
They said you know this guy.

125
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:23,492
Until their operations are finished...

126
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,953
in other words, while they are
manipulating Argus,

127
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,831
I'm requesting that you avoid any
conflict with them.

128
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,292
We won't be carrying out
precautionary measures,

129
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:34,003
maintaining security of the area
is a special forces task.

130
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,338
-Yoo Si-jin.
-Captain Yoo Si-jin.

131
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:39,717
This is what the Corps Commander
is personally requesting.

132
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,719
This is not just a situation report.

133
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,264
I flew all the way over here
to reach you guys.

134
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:47,224
And I'll be leaving in 10 minutes.

135
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,685
It means I've expressed my faith in you.

136
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:52,229
It's an order.

137
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:56,233
From now on, we are not to involve
ourselves in these matters.

138
00:12:58,861 --> 00:12:59,820
Yes, sir.

139
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:06,619
The police said they moved the children
from Phantom Village to the CTA orphanage.

140
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,871
But something seems off.

141
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:13,751
Captain?

142
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,297
From this moment on,

143
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:22,051
we're not to involve ourselves
in any of Argus's matters.

144
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:27,348
I was just at headquarters.

145
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,602
What I'm about to tell you...

146
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,772
is top secret.

147
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:05,553
Because you looked like
you needed some sugar.

148
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:08,347
I'm giving you the last one.

149
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,479
Thank you.

150
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,439
Do you want to share?

151
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:21,402
I'm on a diet. Drink it quickly.
Think of it as medicine.

152
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:29,827
What happened to the children
from Phantom Village?

153
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,620
I haven't seen First Lieutenant Yoon yet.

154
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:33,873
It was all taken care of.

155
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,251
The Uruk government put them with
a protection agency.

156
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:38,794
That's great.

157
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:42,882
The children who were brought to the
Medi Cube are in good health.

158
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,886
So that's why you were so busy,
you didn't even put your hair up.

159
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:51,473
Hold this for a minute.

160
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:56,520
When you ask me to hold something,
you tend to do weird things.

161
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,899
Oh, you can't. I wasn't able
to wash my hair today.

162
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,985
Why not? Did you not have enough water?

163
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,280
This is normal for you,
don't pretend it's not.

164
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:07,990
That's not true.

165
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,783
Exactly when will I meet Dr. Kang?

166
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,041
I can do it myself.

167
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,877
Usually when you're dating,

168
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,713
things that you can do yourself
are done by the other person.

169
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,049
I will do them for you later too.

170
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:28,510
The things that you can do by yourself.

171
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:31,513
Keep your promise.

172
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:47,488
This is Dormitory B.
Some medical and personal packages

173
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:48,739
have arrived from Korea.

174
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:50,574
Oh, packages. 

175
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:55,120
Are you leaving me because a package came?

176
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:59,917
-It's the package or me?
-Of course, it's you.

177
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,799
This is from Doctor Pyo.

178
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:10,344
As expected, there's nobody like
Doctor Pyo.

179
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:13,847
Ah, the smell of Korea.

180
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:17,851
The smell of Korean boxes.

181
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,856
Oh, I will deliver this myself.

182
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,317
Looks like a good
brother-sister relationship.

183
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:34,118
-Did anything come for you?
-Why mine? What about your own?

184
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:36,286
Surprisingly enough,
something came for you.

185
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,456
Who sent it?

186
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:42,710
I did.

187
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:54,471
This is for you. Size 7, right?

188
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,226
Doctor Song.

189
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,522
I don't need a thanks.

190
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,107
I'm a size 6.

191
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:09,737
It's okay. No one will know.

192
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:11,822
I'll know.

193
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:29,715
STAY STRONG!
I MISS YOU!

194
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:33,260
Sergeant Seo, there's a package
from someone named Shin Ji-young.

195
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:34,595
Where are you? Over.

196
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:38,599
Where are you right now?

197
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:43,896
In the kitchen. Should I wait? Over.

198
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:12,049
Solidarity.

199
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,718
Solidarity.

200
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:26,480
-You surprised me.
-I'm going to have to inspect this.

201
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:30,400
"Stay strong. Heart?"

202
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:33,570
"I miss you. Heart"?

203
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,866
Does Sergeant Seo have a younger sister?

204
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,619
-Sergeant Seo is an only child!
-That isn't my fault.

205
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:44,623
Can you do that?

206
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,636
Just look at this!

207
00:18:58,011 --> 00:19:00,013
What is it? Why is Yoo Si-jin here?

208
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:07,771
"The day I met Si-jin.
I'm sending my memories to you."

209
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,524
These men.

210
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:13,318
First Lieutenant Yoon, bring your gun.

211
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,490
-It's a misunderstanding.
-Definitely.

212
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:21,535
Misunderstanding?

213
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,748
A misunderstanding?
When men and women are this friendly?

214
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,877
I guess I see your real smile
through this photo.

215
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,420
I wasn't smiling in that.

216
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,882
It looks like I'm smiling,
I'm making a weird face.

217
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,175
Isn't that right?

218
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,759
It's my younger cousin.

219
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,262
My younger cousin is a flight attendant.

220
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,848
It's just a package
from  your younger cousin,

221
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:46,393
-but you two ran here together?
-Because they played together too.

222
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,064
Which is the younger cousin?

223
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:51,982
-Huh?
-Huh?

224
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:55,194
You will answer on the count of three,
left side or the right side.

225
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,111
One, two, three.

226
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,196
-Left.
-Right.

227
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:01,241
-Right.
-Left.

228
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,998
I only arranged a blind date
for the commander.

229
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:10,083
Nothing more, nothing less.

230
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,464
-Are you throwing me under the bus?
-Yes, I am.

231
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,384
You must have been having a great time,

232
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,845
seeing as she knows this address.

233
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,472
Did you really?

234
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,724
Why did you do that,
Sergeant First Class Seo?

235
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:27,684
I don't understand this guy.

236
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:32,105
I just scolded him harshly.
I did well, didn't I?

237
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,524
Never mind that. Follow me.

238
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:38,153
-Yes, I'm coming.
-Stay where you are.

239
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,324
I thought she was talking to me.

240
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,576
Because it has become a habit
for me to follow.

241
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,079
You better go quickly.

242
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,581
I wish I could stay...

243
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:55,879
Solidarity.

244
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:01,051
I hope you won't misunderstand.
It's all in the past.

245
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:03,553
Yeah, right, in the past.

246
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,099
Then did this come from the past?

247
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:09,017
It came from Seoul.

248
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:14,273
I was right.
It was obvious it was a blind date.

249
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:17,109
Are you talking about the birthday party
for Sergeant Park's son?

250
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,902
When they left right after presents?

251
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:25,200
They said a classmate's father
had passed away.

252
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:28,495
It doesn't even make sense that
they would have the same classmate.

253
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:30,706
They couldn't even get
their story straight with us.

254
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,041
They were both so dressed up that day,

255
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,169
I thought it was their birthday party!

256
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:42,259
Is this the reason you avoided me?
I thought my dad was the stumbling block.

257
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:44,052
Your father is the stumbling block.

258
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:45,595
What did you just say?

259
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,057
What did I just say?

260
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:52,978
-Never mind that. How far did you two go?
-We went as far as the army entrance.

261
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,772
Am I asking about that right now?

262
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:59,526
How far did you go?
Was there intimacy or not?

263
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:02,571
I didn't! It was really innocent.

264
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:06,742
-I only drank some tea.
-What a gentleman.

265
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,076
You flatter me.

266
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,370
So you often enjoy tea with a woman?

267
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:13,206
Here I thought when we parted,
you'd never even see

268
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,916
anyone as a woman again.

269
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,127
I felt sorry for you,

270
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,421
not knowing you were having
such a great time.

271
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,715
I didn't have a good time.

272
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:26,595
To be honest, I had no choice but to be
dragged there out of friendship.

273
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,096
Friendship? Yeah, right.

274
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:33,477
You looked as if you couldn't contain
yourself, you liked it so much.

275
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,438
You only saw it briefly,
I think you're misinterpreting it.

276
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,648
I had a poker face.

277
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:41,151
I only drank tea with this expression.

278
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,028
Don't make me laugh!

279
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:45,614
How do I know if you only had tea
or gave her a ride?

280
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:46,573
I didn't.

281
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:50,827
If you lie, you'll only make things worse.

282
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,499
I did give her a ride.

283
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,753
It wasn't my car.
It was the commander's car.

284
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:05,175
I really couldn't understand
why he brought a car.

285
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,969
You expect me to believe that?

286
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,221
I'm saying forget it.

287
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:11,890
I really don't even remember her name now.

288
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:14,226
You don't remember the name,

289
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:17,354
but you came running when you heard
"Shin Ji-young." Right?

290
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:21,566
-That wasn't me.
-So irritating! You're ticking me off!

291
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:26,488
Just know that this person saved you.

292
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:27,989
Who is it? Is it a man?

293
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,700
It's not the time to be asking that.

294
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:32,953
Man or woman, what will you do?

295
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:35,622
If it's a women, I'll buy her a meal.
If it's a man, I'll buy him a drink.

296
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,250
Because I owe them.

297
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,921
It's the chairman.  What now?

298
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,803
"It's the chairman.  What now?"

299
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:54,599
Doctor Pyo!

300
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:57,102
If I sent you something, girl,

301
00:23:57,185 --> 00:24:00,814
shouldn't you say something like,
"Thanks, I got it,"?

302
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:03,859
Sorry. I was busy,
so I haven't opened it yet.

303
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:06,778
Why are you so busy? Dating?

304
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:09,823
I heard you and that Captain kissed!

305
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:10,907
How did you know?

306
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:13,118
How else would I know? I heard it.

307
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:14,995
I also heard you two fought today.

308
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,663
How did you know that, too?

309
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:18,498
You've been tricked, my friend.

310
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:21,835
I guess you really are dating.

311
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:23,211
Hey, you...

312
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,755
Just a minute,
Doctor Jang wants to talk to you.

313
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:30,510
Doctor, it's me.

314
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:32,679
Are you lying when you say

315
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:35,265
that Lee Chi-hoon is alive
and he's actually dead?

316
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:39,186
What are you talking about?
You still haven't been in contact?

317
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:40,145
No.

318
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:43,940
Is he ending things
so close to my due date?

319
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:48,111
What a punk! Wait a minute,
he's probably doing rounds.

320
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:04,461
It's a painkiller. It will sting a little.

321
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:09,799
Never mind that. Why don't you just go?

322
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:12,636
Just seeing you gives me pain.

323
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:18,934
Get that away!

324
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,728
Why would I get an injection
not knowing what it is?

325
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:24,105
If you were me,
would you wanna be treated by you?

326
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:27,943
You should be the one uncomfortable
with the fact that I'm alive.

327
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,363
Don't you hear me?

328
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:34,783
I said to go because I'm not
going to get the injection.

329
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,332
Please save me.

330
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:51,758
Please pull me out.

331
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:56,972
I did it because I was scared.

332
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:00,100
You were right about everything you said.

333
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:06,147
In that moment, I wasn't a doctor.

334
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:13,697
I'm very sorry...
for running away on my own.

335
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:21,329
You're really self-centered.

336
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:25,083
What? You want to be honest with me

337
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:28,211
to get rid of some of that guilt?

338
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:32,757
If I could get rid of it that easily,
I already would have.

339
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:39,598
I just don't know what to do.

340
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:44,686
Please tell me.
I'll do whatever you tell me to.

341
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:51,359
No matter how much I think about it,

342
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,864
there's nobody to talk to but you.

343
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,449
Don't talk to me.

344
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,577
You didn't take my hand.

345
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,371
You didn't rescue me!

346
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:08,168
So don't don't put your hand out
for me to take

347
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:11,129
because I'm not going to take it either.

348
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:25,477
I'll go ask Doctor Song to give you
your injection. Please take it.

349
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:46,373
Hey, Lee Chi-hoon, where are you?

350
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:48,041
Why aren't you in the Medi Cube?

351
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,502
While I'm saying it nicely...

352
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,599
You're really hurt.

353
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:11,940
When did you get here?

354
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:14,693
Did you come by yourself again?

355
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:20,448
You worry me. Why do you wander alone?
It's dangerous.

356
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,582
Why are you so hurt?

357
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:44,389
Where is he hiding?

358
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:49,602
Doctor Han, Doctor Song, Doctor Kang,
this is medical supply storage.

359
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:51,521
Please come here. There's a big problem!

360
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:04,075
Geez! They got this off. What's missing?

361
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,036
The packages of narcotic painkillers.
They've all disappeared.

362
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,165
Codeine, morphine, fentanyl, levorphanol.
All of them.

363
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:13,084
-When was it checked last?
-At 11:00 this morning.

364
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:16,045
There was no one unfamiliar,
no patients are missing.

365
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:17,380
How did this happen?

366
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:22,385
Even if no patients disappeared,
one person has.

367
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:26,347
This is the Medi Cube.
Has anyone seen Fatima today?

368
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,241
Fatima wouldn't be here.

369
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,535
There's information here.

370
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:38,169
Where's the black market for narcotics?

371
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,109
It should be near here.

372
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,653
How do we find it here?

373
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:05,488
Do we have to dig around everywhere?

374
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:07,866
Over there!

375
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:54,579
More guns? Why are there guns every day?
What kind of country is this?

376
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,081
Because you acted alone
without asking me.

377
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:00,501
If we came a little later,
Fatima might have been hurt.

378
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:04,130
Yes, good job. We're about to get shot,
but Fatima will be fine.

379
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,432
-What are we going to do?
-There's a way.

380
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:18,436
Seven guns. Dr. Kang,
you take the right side.

381
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:20,396
I'll take the left side.

382
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:24,233
Don't be scared.

383
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:47,006
-I thought I could fool him.
-Seriously?

384
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,549
Okay. No more jokes.

385
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,135
Listen to me carefully.

386
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:53,888
When I say, "now,"

387
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:57,433
run away no matter what, bring the car
and wait by the door.

388
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:58,559
Five minutes will do.

389
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:03,189
If five minutes pass and I'm not out,
just leave immediately.

390
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:06,234
You will be helping me.
Do you understand what I'm saying?

391
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:18,997
Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

392
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,249
Okay, I'm dropping it.

393
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,295
Do I just drop it here?
Do you like this spot?

394
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:33,136
I can't use this gun anyway.

395
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:37,765
If I shoot this gun,
I'll have to write too many reports.

396
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:42,562
So what I'm saying is,
let me use your guns.

397
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:44,814
Now!

398
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,488
Five minutes have passed,
why isn't he coming out?

399
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,865
I don't know! I have no choice!

400
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:09,732
Get in quickly! Fatima, come on!

401
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:11,067
Hurry!

402
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:23,329
Wow, awesome! This is totally exciting!

403
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:26,082
No one will follow us, right?

404
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:27,875
We did it!

405
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:32,213
I'm still excited!
Is this why you became a soldier?

406
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:35,925
I fought off the enemy!

407
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:37,844
You almost fought me off as well.

408
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:41,681
Of course, I thought I'd miss you.
I had it all calculated!

409
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:46,185
With calculations like that, how did you
make it through medical school?

410
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,410
Why is the car doing this?

411
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:04,996
Don't you know?

412
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:06,998
It's too beat up.

413
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,418
This woman has now wrecked three cars.

414
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:34,942
I will not accept a sergeant first class
as a son-in-law.

415
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:37,403
Take off your military uniform.

416
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,281
Work for Myeong-ju's company
and learn the business.

417
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:43,117
Think about it until the last day
of your deployment.

418
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,745
And when you return,
come back to me with your decision.

419
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:56,797
You really don't listen!

420
00:36:57,506 --> 00:37:01,052
It's dangerous, so I'm sure I told you
to stay put where it was safe.

421
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:07,016
It's boring where it's safe.

422
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:12,021
After two steps to the left,
face me directly.

423
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:18,236
You've been ignoring your superior's
words too often lately.

424
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:21,072
Face toward the front.

425
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:28,537
One step forward.

426
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:38,673
What are you doing right now?

427
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,591
I'm not trying out make up.

428
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,886
-Just some physical contact with you.
-The kids are watching.

429
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:46,973
-There are kids over there?
-You know that this is harassment?

430
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:50,726
Why? Is it too much
because it's not from a flight attendant?

431
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:58,484
It's too much because
it's First Lieutenant Yoon Myeong-ju.

432
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,698
The kids are watching.

433
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:07,618
I can win against anyone.

434
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:24,218
Big Boss transmitting. I'm roughly 15 km
from the city towards the barracks.

435
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,928
The car has broken down.

436
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:28,139
If there are any soldiers within radius,
contact me.

437
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:32,727
I'll let it go for a moment.

438
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:36,605
-I can't win against this guy.
-He's of no help to me.

439
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:42,028
Wolf transmitting. Currently on landmine
operation near Phantom Village.

440
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:43,237
What's the matter?

441
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:46,824
Why do you always get stuck on the road?

442
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:48,242
No kidding.

443
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,869
Just send anyone.

444
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:53,331
Transmission received.
I will send Sergeant Gong.

445
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:08,179
How would she know to only select
the narcotic painkillers to take with her?

446
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:13,142
She must have had a life of learning
what is expensive and what is cheap.

447
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,936
The things that save the most people are

448
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:20,066
inexpensive medication like disinfectants,
antibiotics, and vaccinations.

449
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:23,486
It would have been good
if she had a life of learning that first.

450
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:28,449
You know what you did wrong...

451
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,494
What would that be in English?

452
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,122
It looks like she understood.

453
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,636
Why wouldn't I care
after I just saved you!

454
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:52,640
Don't talk back! When you talk back,
I have to speak more broken English.

455
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:55,434
I'm about to throw up. Anyway...

456
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:14,412
It seems like she understood
everything I said, right?

457
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:17,289
Especially the part where you said
it wasn't free.

458
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:19,458
I rolled my tongue
so she would understand.

459
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:23,546
I did promise. I did.

460
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:31,470
I didn't wash my hair.

461
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:44,567
What are you doing?

462
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:48,571
I'm drying my hair.
The air here is the best.

463
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:51,282
You finally washed your hair.

464
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:54,201
Did you really wash your hair?

465
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:55,828
Is the water coming running okay?

466
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:56,871
Go to sleep!

467
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:01,500
It's such a waste sleeping
during the night, isn't it?

468
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:03,836
Wanna come over for ramen?

469
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:08,340
What is this insincere offer?

470
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:13,345
It's a very sincere temptation.

471
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:16,348
Agreed!

472
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:21,520
Solidarity.
The boiling water is on standby.

473
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:23,022
Two hot bowls of ramen.

474
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:25,483
I will prepare it.

475
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:30,571
What happened to the car?
Can it be fixed?

476
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,990
I'm still looking into it.

477
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:36,368
You already owe for Daniel's car
and you did it again.

478
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:38,412
And even the tuition fee for that girl.

479
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:41,665
Are you really going to pay
for Fatima's school fees?

480
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:45,044
-Why?
-You must have a lot of doctors coats.

481
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:49,048
Touching someone else's life

482
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:52,176
means that your responsibility
gets that much greater.

483
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:55,221
I'm just doing what I can
to the best of my ability.

484
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:56,972
Even if it's haphazard.

485
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,101
You know who said that?

486
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:04,522
Me, well... I don't forget things easily.

487
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:07,274
You can't take responsibility for everyone
that you meet.

488
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:08,943
The world won't change that way.

489
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:11,695
Even if it doesn't change the world,

490
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,906
it will change Fatima's life.

491
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:17,910
And if it will be something
that changes her world,

492
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,870
then that's enough.

493
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:24,625
-You said you weren't that kind of doctor.
-You said I was that kind of doctor.

494
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:28,462
Why are you constantly
showing off your charm?

495
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,214
I've already fallen for you.

496
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:34,385
If we both have a lot of debt,

497
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:36,053
it will be easier to split up.

498
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:42,268
Thank you for saving me today.

499
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:49,775
I have prepared two refreshing bowls.

500
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:51,819
Thank you.

501
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,029
I will enjoy the food.

502
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:00,703
Oh? At a time like this? Why?

503
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:03,622
Don't you have a lantern?
The ramen will get soggy.

504
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:08,168
Should we try eating late night snacks
special forces style?

505
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:12,298
So funny! What is this?

506
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:15,718
I get to lots of things
after finding myself a special forces man.

507
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:21,932
You were made for the army. Let's use this
chance to confirm you as an army lover.

508
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:23,934
What other things would I get to do?

509
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:26,228
Ah! Should we try soccer?

510
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:30,190
When I go to back to Korea,
I'll say I played soccer in the military.

511
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:33,027
Here's to one shot.

512
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:35,738
One shot. Eat.

513
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:43,662
They keep coming out.

514
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:48,125
I knew this would happen,
so I just drank water.

515
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:34,046
Okay.

516
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:15,295
Oh, the smell!

517
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:34,982
Chief Manager Jin was arrested
at the airport?

518
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:37,901
Yes. He was arrested
for a fraudulent identity.

519
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:42,072
But it wasn't by the U.S. Army or INTERPOL
but by the Mohuru police.

520
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:45,492
The embassy is up in arms
to confirm his identity.

521
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:50,706
It means there's someone who ordered
the Mohuru Police Chief to arrest him.

522
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:52,875
Could it be because of the diamonds?

523
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:57,379
The diamonds... If there were this much,
how much would they be worth?

524
00:45:57,963 --> 00:45:59,173
Diamonds?

525
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:03,010
Tell me everything.

526
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:07,639
I saw it every time the supply trucks
came through. He placed them in the safe.

527
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:23,363
Supply trucks?
Ones that cross the borders?

528
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:27,367
He always personally managed
the supply trucks.

529
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:31,330
On some days,
he would have blood on his trousers.

530
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:37,419
Those diamonds... were real?

531
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:40,672
That unlucky bastard.
I thought he was suspicious.

532
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:42,883
Why are you only telling us about
that now?

533
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:45,344
I was busy coming back to life
from the dead.

534
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:46,804
What do you expect?

535
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:51,016
It seems like he was constantly going
to his office because of the diamonds.

536
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:53,060
That's right. That's why.

537
00:46:53,852 --> 00:46:56,772
If there were this many diamonds,
how much would it be worth?

538
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:58,816
I don't have a good feeling about this.

539
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:00,734
Usually, in circumstances like this,

540
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:03,445
the police receive a corpse
from a bizarre death.

541
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:06,073
That corpse was Chief Manager Jin.

542
00:47:06,448 --> 00:47:08,659
I have a feeling,
we will need to write a long report.

543
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:11,495
I have a feeling I will be writing
that long report.

544
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:16,667
Where are you going?
How much would it be worth?

545
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:20,587
They don't know.

546
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:13,116
Target secured.

547
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:18,664
The target is safe.

548
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:24,294
Do we really just leave the rest?

549
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:33,845
As we planned,
we just get our country's bad guy.

550
00:49:34,763 --> 00:49:37,724
The Alpha Team is retreating immediately.

551
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:15,512
Do the diamonds that you have
belong to Argus?

552
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:16,763
What?

553
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:22,227
Diamonds?
What diamonds are you talking about?

554
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:25,522
I was literally dragged out
without any pants on,

555
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:26,815
where would they be?

556
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:33,155
Speak truthfully.

557
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:35,991
I have to know how much
you're worth to Argus

558
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:39,453
so I can see what's in it for me
since I'm taking care of your ass.

559
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:46,626
I'm in pain, so call the doctor for me.

560
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,045
The doctor is here.

561
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:50,505
I found what you're looking for.

562
00:50:52,257 --> 00:50:54,718
I think he is too old
to be chewing on rocks.

563
00:50:57,929 --> 00:50:59,598
Did he swallow these?

564
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:06,396
Hey, Mister, playing sick won't--

565
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:18,116
His breathing is weak and so is his pulse.

566
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:21,745
The diamonds
are causing internal bleeding.

567
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:27,751
There is an emergency patient here.
Medical Team, prepare the operating room.

568
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:35,592
I paged Dr. Song.
Why are you here instead?

569
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:38,136
Doctor Song is not well,
so I paged the army surgeon.

570
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,097
I'm here to fill in
as the second surgeon.

571
00:51:41,014 --> 00:51:45,352
-Blood pressure continues to drop.
-I'll open the abdomen now. Scalpel.

572
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:51,900
The bleeding is very heavy.

573
00:51:51,983 --> 00:51:55,195
So did this patient really swallow
all those diamonds?

574
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:58,532
Yeah. I think we will really be
able to see "blood diamonds."

575
00:51:59,032 --> 00:52:01,118
It's a mess inside.
Please hold this for me.

576
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:02,285
Okay.

577
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:11,545
Oh, I am sorry.
I think I got the wrong blood vessel.

578
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:12,921
I got it.

579
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:20,554
It's not the blood vessel.

580
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:23,598
A tumor on his lymph node has burst.

581
00:52:24,182 --> 00:52:26,476
His intestinal bleeding
is from the diamonds,

582
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:29,354
so why does he have enlarged lymph nodes?

583
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:36,361
If he wasn't pretending
and was having breathing problems...

584
00:52:40,031 --> 00:52:41,283
Everyone, stop.

585
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:43,910
Take your hands off,
and back away from the table!

586
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:49,666
Coughing, difficulty breathing,
mucosal  bleeding, 

587
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:51,084
and enlarged lymph nodes...

588
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:52,669
Combine all of these symptoms...

589
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:57,799
this patient is showing symptoms
of a viral hemorrhagic fever.

590
00:52:57,924 --> 00:53:01,178
My guess is due to the
malignant pestilence of the M-type virus.

591
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:05,515
Until we get an accurate diagnosis, the
operating room will be on lock down.

592
00:53:09,644 --> 00:53:12,355
Myself and Lieutenant Yoon
have already been exposed.

593
00:53:12,939 --> 00:53:15,817
-Everyone please leave the room.
-What about the operation?

594
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:19,154
I think you and I
will have to finish this up.

595
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:29,497
What is an M-virus?

596
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:31,917
Please explain it in detail.

597
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,003
It is one of the WHO-listed
infectious diseases.

598
00:53:36,671 --> 00:53:41,051
The only way to find out if it's either
an M2 or M3 is to do a PCR test.

599
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:44,763
What's the difference?

600
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:48,892
If it's M2, it's more severe than the flu.

601
00:53:50,268 --> 00:53:53,188
If it's M3, then it's slightly better
than Ebola.

602
00:53:57,108 --> 00:53:59,569
No!  It's dangerous over here,
talk from where you are.

603
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:02,530
Are you okay? Are you really hurt?

604
00:54:03,698 --> 00:54:05,700
How could I be in pain already?

605
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:09,871
We just have to wait and see.
We are drawing blood right now.

606
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:15,585
Yoon Myeong-ju.

607
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:18,088
It's still quite admirable.

608
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:22,300
They ran here faster than for the package
from the flight attendants.

609
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:24,010
Are you okay?

610
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:29,557
Wow. Did I make the mighty
Seo Dae-young scared?

611
00:54:36,314 --> 00:54:37,482
What should I do?

612
00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:39,985
What can I do for you? Just tell me.

613
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:44,739
Answer me.
"The day I met Si-jin, heart."

614
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:47,784
Was it written by the girl
on the left or the right?

615
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:50,161
Left side. She was very cutesy.

616
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:52,330
Oh, is that so?

617
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:54,582
She acted very cute.

618
00:54:57,419 --> 00:55:01,548
And I guess this man just answers
questions because I asked him to.

619
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:04,134
It didn't seem like a time for jokes.

620
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:10,890
We're going to die. We're dying.

621
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:13,184
Everything we say
sounds like our last words.

622
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:20,150
Both of you lighten up already.

623
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:21,943
We won't die on you, okay?

624
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:24,988
Of course. It's all ready now.

625
00:55:25,363 --> 00:55:29,242
But do you think there is a hospital near
us with a lab for a PCR test?

626
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:32,912
The general hospital in the city won't be
able to test it till tomorrow.

627
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:38,001
There is a U.S. military base with a
pathology lab 20 minutes from here.

628
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:40,670
-But I'm not sure if they'll help.
-I'll take care of it.

629
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:42,505
I'll get transport prepared.

630
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:09,449
His blood pressure and pulse are stable.

631
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:14,329
We did everything we could do as surgeons.

632
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:19,626
What do we do now?

633
00:56:20,293 --> 00:56:22,629
All we can do now is
wait for the test results.

634
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:25,673
That goes for both the patient
and ourselves.

635
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:02,710
They really are blood diamonds
after all.

636
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:05,839
I suppose those are real diamonds?

637
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:09,801
I wonder how much they're worth.

638
00:57:11,636 --> 00:57:13,847
We're the only ones
who know how many there are.

639
00:57:15,056 --> 00:57:16,224
Should we each take one?

640
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:20,520
I didn't think you were like that.

641
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:24,023
You are quite wise.

642
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:50,467
Are you crazy?

643
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:54,012
Hurry up and leave!
I'm in isolation right now--

644
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:29,547
I guess it's me.

645
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,498
There can be problems
with a good immune system.

646
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:04,916
Then what should we do?

647
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:07,085
He knows the U.S. military's plans.

648
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:08,920
And our strategy.

649
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:11,339
The worst has started.

650
00:59:11,422 --> 00:59:12,257
First Lieutenant Yoon!

651
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:15,009
The truck that carried the vaccine
has been stolen.

652
00:59:15,134 --> 00:59:17,303
Medications to treat Lieutenant Yoon
were in there.

653
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:20,431
We have to get the bastards
who stole them.

654
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:22,850
Where is Doctor Kang? I don't see her.

655
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:24,936
The cops came by yesterday,

656
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:26,813
she went with Fatima
to the police station.

657
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:28,189
What did you just say?

658
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:37,782
