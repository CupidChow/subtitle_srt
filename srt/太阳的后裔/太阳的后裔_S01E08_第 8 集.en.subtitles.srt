1
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:30,530
I really missed you.

2
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:42,459
Whatever I did, I kept thinking of you.

3
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:48,173
I physically exhausted myself,
I tried hard,

4
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:50,967
I drank and tried everything.

5
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,222
Even then, I still missed you.

6
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,904
It was unexpected.

7
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:15,617
Then think about it.

8
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:18,453
This isn't a joke.

9
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:35,470
Rest a bit.

10
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:38,598
I was going to take you back,

11
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,142
but I have to go right now to be on time.

12
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,855
I'm reporting to headquarters
on the situation.

13
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,111
You can make calls at the headquarters,
right?

14
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,030
I need to make a phone call.

15
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,286
EPISODE 8

16
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:02,455
Report on the current casualties count.

17
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:06,876
Currently 3 missing, 20 dead, 42 injured.

18
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,045
No additional casualties.

19
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,651
The network is down at
the Mowuru Company, right?

20
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:34,237
Yes. How long will it take
for restoration?

21
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,698
It'll take about two to three days.

22
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:40,493
The briefing will take place
in five minutes.

23
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:53,006
I was with him in his final moments.

24
00:02:55,466 --> 00:03:00,013
There was something
he wanted me to tell you,

25
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:01,681
so I called you.

26
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:07,812
As I don't have to work
and lay down here to see the sky,

27
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,606
it's really nice.

28
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,692
I feel so blessed.

29
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:19,115
I was able to earn money to send
my kids to college.

30
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,285
They just live however they want to live.

31
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,037
My wife...

32
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,795
My wife...

33
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,174
She and I spent more time looking
at each other's pictures

34
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:38,718
than at each other's faces.

35
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,597
My Ok-nam...

36
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:46,476
Now she really can only look at
the pictures.

37
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:56,486
Regarding his pension,
besides the one from the company,

38
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:59,530
his nephew will take care of another one.

39
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:05,912
Yes. And...

40
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:15,755
he said you should not stay alone
for too long.

41
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:45,785
All the emergency surgeries are finished.

42
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:48,246
You've worked hard, Dr. Song.

43
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:58,006
-It looks like a wedding ring, right?
-Yeah.

44
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,300
Did you steal it?

45
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,974
It's the ring of the patient
I just finished operating on.

46
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,227
I couldn't return it.

47
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:42,342
Until your left arm heals properly,
keep it like this.

48
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,178
Thank you.

49
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,563
Are you really going to be like this?
You can't say no.

50
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:57,982
I promised them an interview
in exchange for blood.

51
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,401
I already took their blood.
What am I going to do?

52
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:04,072
So, what are you going to do?

53
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:05,031
Right side.

54
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:06,949
You should help a bit.

55
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:08,534
Aren't you hungry?

56
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:11,329
Let's finish this quickly and eat.
Left side.

57
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,831
Don't be like that.
Show your face a little bit.

58
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,583
What good is it for otherwise?

59
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:20,963
I'm going to use it on you,
to be appealing to my wife.

60
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,256
Keep calling me your wife.

61
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,384
Keep calling?
You just gave me permission.

62
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,720
Lantern, left side.

63
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,811
Do it later.
Didn't you say you were hungry?

64
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,437
I'll check if we have something.

65
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:02,130
But the person  fixing the car outside...

66
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:06,968
Who is he?
Why did he use our operation room?

67
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:12,056
Some type of peacemaker
relief doctor or something.

68
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:13,683
For real?

69
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:16,602
With that face, why?

70
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,730
Is that Dr. Daniel by any chance?

71
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,899
Yeah, you know him?

72
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,819
Oh, I am right.
I recognized him right away.

73
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:26,946
I should have tried talking to him...

74
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,489
What's with this stalker?

75
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,158
I prefer the term "fan".

76
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,869
He's not just any Schweitzer.

77
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,079
He's a Schweitzer with
Bill Gates's background.

78
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,999
He's the son of an enormous
hedge fund owner in Canada.

79
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:39,125
-For real?
-Really?

80
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:43,337
Yes! Because of that, he's really famous
within the NGO community.

81
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:47,049
His mom is Korean, so he's famous
in Korea for that as well.

82
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:50,553
If he is that rich,
why would he work in an NGO?

83
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:53,806
Because he is so rich
that he has nothing to worry about.

84
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,391
He needs to make worries.

85
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,937
Where is Dr. Kang?
Still at the headquarters?

86
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,545
Please don't look at me.

87
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:33,471
Aren't there any places
to be shady around here?

88
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,518
That's what a man usually says.

89
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:45,149
Then should I try my best
at being shady?

90
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,242
You did well, today.

91
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:07,880
I need to hear your answer,
so that I can wipe your tears.

92
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,302
Look at me for a moment.

93
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:30,695
Wow, the stars are really shameless.

94
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,116
They don't know
what the ground did down here.

95
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,202
I thought it would be comforting.

96
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:42,957
I have already been consoled
by you, Captain.

97
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:56,012
Thank you for coming back.

98
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:05,646
If you weren't there today,
I might have run away.

99
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,067
If you have a plan to run away,
let's do it together.

100
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:14,363
Running away is more fun
when a man and a woman do it together.

101
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:04,557
Water.

102
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:10,271
Is anybody here?

103
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,442
Help me, please.

104
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:26,537
Ugh, it's too much work. I'll just die.

105
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,626
The Sleep Monster, Mr. Kang.

106
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:34,795
Safety hat.

107
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,673
Safety hat on site. Safety hat!

108
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:38,716
Safety hat.

109
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:44,054
Keep doing that until your head blows up
and you'll croak, you rascal.

110
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,100
I wore my safety hat,

111
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,689
so hurry and come save me.

112
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:17,254
It feels so invigorating!

113
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,964
We should have done this earlier.

114
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,469
Let's go straight through
into the office like this.

115
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,643
Stop the forklift.

116
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:33,729
Alpha Team,
resume the search for survivors.

117
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,148
-Medics, get ready as well.
-Roger that.

118
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,651
Why? How much more searching
do you need to do?

119
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,694
There are still three people missing.

120
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,321
What nonsense is that?

121
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:45,157
As it stands, you should see
the missing as deceased by now!

122
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,452
Doctors will make that call.

123
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,873
Hey, three stripes!
Are you in charge this time--

124
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:56,377
-Please leave the site.
-Leave again? You!

125
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,419
You're leaving!

126
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,340
The missing are survivors.

127
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:04,426
We will not give up on
the survivors until the end.

128
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,388
We will start the survivor search now.

129
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:10,266
-If it's not possible...
-Make it possible!

130
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,860
I'm going crazy.

131
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,497
We're the rescue team
from the Taebaek Division.

132
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:37,418
Is there anyone in there?

133
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:40,004
If there is, please knock three times.

134
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:56,061
If it doesn't work,
I'll make it happen.

135
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,606
I'll find the survivors.

136
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:01,025
We're the Taebaek Rescue team.

137
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:50,032
Are you from the rescue team?

138
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,451
Oh! How do I get him out?

139
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:57,081
Please save me. Hurry!

140
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:59,041
I'm a doctor!

141
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:20,062
It's the aftershock! Get out!

142
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,986
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

143
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,779
I'm okay!

144
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,949
Please get me out. Hurry!

145
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:33,283
Grab my hand!

146
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,056
What are you waiting for? It's collapsing!

147
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:57,850
Hurry up!

148
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:00,477
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry!

149
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,522
Where are you going? Hey! Hey!

150
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,232
Save me!

151
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:07,192
Get me out!

152
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,877
Are you okay?

153
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,589
There's a person inside...

154
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,215
Are you alright?

155
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,801
Are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere?

156
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,595
There's a person inside!

157
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:36,388
Hurry, it's collapsing!

158
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,474
There's a person in there. A Korean.

159
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,439
Wait here and look out.

160
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:49,318
If the building starts to sway and lean
by 10 degrees or more, blow the whistle.

161
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:50,611
Yes, I understand.

162
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,781
Please prepare the Control Center
for radio standby.

163
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:56,283
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

164
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:59,286
If the scale reads higher than 5.0
or if he whistles--

165
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,914
I've got it,
so give me your hand for a little bit.

166
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:08,045
How in that world is that fine?

167
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,255
I'll put on a compression bandage.

168
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:41,703
Where am I?

169
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:45,499
The third floor basement?

170
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,169
I'm going crazy, jeez.

171
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:52,422
Save me!

172
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,843
Please get me out of here!

173
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,641
Can you hear my voice?

174
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:05,602
Survivor! Can you hear my voice?

175
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:08,522
Yes, I can hear it. I can hear it well.

176
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:12,901
Will you please save me!

177
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,408
-The survivor's location?
-Third floor basement.

178
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,160
Alpha team is securing an entrance.

179
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,078
Tell them I'm coming in.

180
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:28,750
Let's go together.

181
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:33,630
Give me the first aid kit and
you wait here.

182
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,549
I need to check the patient.

183
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:38,719
The first rule of a rescue site
is to not create a new victim.

184
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:40,596
Until the area is secured,

185
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,432
the rescuer
will treat the patients himself.

186
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,436
Wolf transmitting. Do you hear me?

187
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,938
In five minutes,
the survivor will be secured. 

188
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,023
Send a medical kit.

189
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:52,983
Understood. I'm going down now.

190
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,494
What are you doing right now?

191
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,247
Do you think I can't read?

192
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:09,041
It's better to make sure.

193
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:14,004
I was first in my class at the Academy,

194
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:18,342
and at West Point,
where I learned English in America--

195
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:21,637
As soon as you check
the survivor's vitals, please let me know.

196
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,474
Here.

197
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:30,979
I will come back
and speak to you in English,

198
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:32,522
so wait for me.

199
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:50,499
Did you bring anything to eat?

200
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:53,126
This guy just keeps giving me water.

201
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,003
He said I shouldn't eat anything.

202
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,258
You're empty-handed.

203
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,551
-His health appears to be fine
and he's noisy.

204
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,262
But the problem is over there.

205
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,722
We'll need to widen the space
using a hydraulic pump,

206
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:08,016
but it'll take time,
that space is too narrow.

207
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,893
How did you get here?

208
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:14,398
How did someone working on
the east side get to the west side?

209
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:16,149
This is the west side?

210
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:20,237
There was a hole, so I kept crawling.

211
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:24,324
I should have gone upward
instead of to the side.

212
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,452
Get me out quickly.

213
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,913
I'm hungry and in pain.

214
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,748
Where does it hurt the most?

215
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:35,419
Blood pressure is 130/100. Pulse is 85.

216
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,963
His ankle and shoulder may be fractured.

217
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:39,506
His vital signs are good.

218
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:42,467
For now, give him Dextrose
and painkillers intravenously.

219
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:45,012
Do you know how to find
the vein for the IV line?

220
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:46,638
I can do it.

221
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,932
Have you done it before?

222
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,184
We were trained in the army.

223
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,023
Have you done this before?

224
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,735
Why is everyone being
like this with me today?

225
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:03,363
If it isn't the arm,
it will be the forehead. Okay?

226
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:04,906
The forehead hurts more.

227
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:06,908
Let's do it in the arm.

228
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:12,581
I'm going to give him IV fluids
and 30 mg of the NSAID.

229
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:20,756
I think we will need one
more hydraulic pump.

230
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:22,924
I think so, too.

231
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,511
I think someone needs to go out
and get it.

232
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:27,471
Yes.

233
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,515
I think you have to go out and bring it.

234
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:34,728
I'll stay here.
The passageway is narrow.

235
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:38,065
You should do the hard work.

236
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,236
Understood, sir.

237
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:07,427
How long have I been trapped here? 

238
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,096
This is the third day.

239
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,807
A bit more than 50 hours.

240
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:17,479
Did a lot of people die?

241
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:29,741
There were many who died,
and many whom we rescued.

242
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:33,954
You survived too.

243
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:39,126
We don't know that yet.

244
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:43,505
But why is it so itchy?

245
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,847
Dr. Kang, do you hear me?

246
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:57,352
He's having difficulty breathing,
and his blood pressure is dropping.

247
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:59,688
I'm sure I administered it properly.

248
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:02,607
-It is because you gave it properly.
-What?

249
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:06,486
It's rare,
but he might be allergic to NSAIDs.

250
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,531
In a short while,
his airway will swell as well.

251
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:10,991
What should I do?

252
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:12,701
Double the amount of IV fluids

253
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:15,787
and administer Pheniramine.
He'll be fine, so don't worry.

254
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:20,083
But it isn't with the drugs you brought.
What should we do?

255
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:23,378
-Deputy Commander Seo, you heard this?
-I'll bring it there.

256
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,046
I'll find it and bring it to you.

257
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,553
How's it in there?

258
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:32,721
It isn't good.

259
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:34,723
It can collapse at any time.

260
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,099
Here is the Pheniramine.

261
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:46,359
It's not an aftershock.

262
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:49,696
What's this sound?
Check the power plant immediately!

263
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:15,889
What's the situation?
Is there another aftershock?

264
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,934
Control Center!

265
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:23,021
What's going on?
I barely survived as it is! What now?

266
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:24,940
Move out of the way!

267
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:29,236
Sir, are you okay?

268
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:32,697
Sir! Please answer.

269
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,784
Sir. Sir!

270
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:41,831
We lost contact.

271
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,378
Big Boss, Big Boss.
Answer me if you hear this.

272
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:50,090
Chief Manager Jin is digging
with an excavator.

273
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:52,926
That son of a bitch!
Drag him over here immediately!

274
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:58,723
You bastard! Stop right now!

275
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:00,475
There are survivors inside!

276
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:12,445
I've caught the crazy bastard.

277
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:14,739
Nail him down so he can't run away.

278
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,951
If anything bad happens,
I'll crack his skull.

279
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:20,328
Alpha Team, get your equipment
and come here now.

280
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:21,913
-We have no time.
-Yes, sir!

281
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:28,503
The structure is weak.
If it collapses again...

282
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:34,175
It's useless to say
it's dangerous, isn't it?

283
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:38,305
Solidarity.

284
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:02,078
Hey, Mister.

285
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:04,831
Mister?

286
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,710
Mister, are you okay?

287
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,672
Hey, you didn't die, did you?

288
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:16,760
Please get up. Okay?

289
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:21,640
I guess he is dead.

290
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:27,395
Is there anyone out there?

291
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:30,357
There's a dead person here!

292
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:35,737
Don't call me "Mister".

293
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:40,325
Are you okay? Mister!

294
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,952
I thought you died.

295
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:49,793
Don't call me "Mister"!

296
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:53,380
Is that important right now?

297
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,342
Yes, it's always important!

298
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:04,391
Are you hurt anywhere?

299
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,688
Now is not the time
for you to worry about me.

300
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:14,192
Your wrist is bleeding.

301
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:15,819
It seems so.

302
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,157
Your foot is out now.

303
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:27,956
What good is that?

304
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,458
The entrance is blocked.

305
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:33,420
We're still trapped.

306
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:41,511
Big Boss transmitting. Can anyone
from the Control Center respond?

307
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:46,599
Big Boss here. Control Center! Alpha Team!

308
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:49,102
I was doubting
why I was so lucky to survive.

309
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:52,397
I'll just think of myself as good as dead.

310
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:54,649
Don't worry. You won't die.

311
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:57,569
What are you saying?
The radio doesn't even work.

312
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:02,991
I said we're going to
get out of here alive.

313
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:04,325
Hey, kid.

314
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,536
Isn't your girlfriend waiting?

315
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:08,371
I don't have a girlfriend.

316
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:10,915
Do you have one?

317
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,962
Earlier over the radio,

318
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:18,256
you heard
that female doctor's voice, right?

319
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:22,761
I really like her, but...

320
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:26,765
I've been rejected about three times.

321
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,767
Should I have died?

322
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:31,269
Oh, my gosh, you're still alive.

323
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:34,230
If it were me,
I would have died of embarrassment.

324
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:37,192
And yet, I pulled it off. Again!

325
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:42,280
This is the Control Center.
Please respond, Big Boss.

326
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:45,366
Please answer me.

327
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,329
I'm going to go crazy.

328
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:55,043
He will be okay. We will be able
to get in touch with him soon.

329
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,005
But what were you doing?

330
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:05,512
Getting ready to run at any given moment

331
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:07,222
because I can't fall.

332
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,993
I was hoping you weren't hurt.

333
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:36,084
You too, Captain.

334
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:43,216
That woman must be so scared.

335
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:44,968
She must think I'm dead.

336
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:50,223
"I should've accepted
his confession of love,"

337
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:52,892
she might think.

338
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,604
So you think she deserves it?

339
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:58,648
No.

340
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,277
I'm worried.

341
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:08,283
Give me your arm.

342
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,083
What's your name?

343
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:19,210
Kang Min-jae.

344
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:20,920
Kang Min-jae.

345
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:22,046
What are you doing?

346
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:23,590
It's a letter.

347
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:27,594
Letter? What letter?

348
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:32,098
In case you're the only one to get out.

349
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,559
What are you saying?

350
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:36,686
We both have to get out together.

351
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,230
Stop talking.

352
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:43,651
Your throat is starting to swell.
Don't talk and just stay still.

353
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,278
That's why...

354
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:47,071
Oh, my throat is swollen.

355
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:49,866
See? I'm dying.

356
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:51,743
I said you won't die.

357
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:54,162
You don't believe me?

358
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:57,332
-I look really trustworthy.
-I don't think so.

359
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,043
It's because you're hurt.

360
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:04,255
Anyway, I have faith in my colleagues.

361
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:07,300
So you should try to  believe in them too.

362
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,072
He's here.

363
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:34,285
In the future, if you're still alive,
be quicker to shout out an answer.

364
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:38,206
See?

365
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,042
We are saved.

366
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:44,212
The survivors will be out soon.
Medical team, be on standby.

367
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:50,551
Are you okay?

368
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:55,181
What's your name?

369
00:32:58,351 --> 00:32:59,811
I'm alive.

370
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:04,399
Possible fracture, NSAID 30 mg.

371
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,819
It's the patient from the accident.

372
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:09,779
His chart is right here.

373
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:12,448
Who wrote this?

374
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,118
Who wrote this?

375
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:19,372
Mister soldier who saved my life.

376
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:24,794
It's nice to make it out alive.

377
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:28,464
And I got to see a pretty doctor like you.

378
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:33,469
This is what I get for saving him.

379
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,847
I told you not to call me Mister.

380
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:38,182
Transport him to the Medi Cube.

381
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:03,374
One more stretcher over here.

382
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:09,172
Is there another patient?

383
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:13,551
Me. A survivor.

384
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:21,476
I'll treat that patient.

385
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:28,191
-Do you remember?
-What?

386
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:32,028
Nothing came to mind
when you heard Sergeant Seo was okay?

387
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:35,239
I was the one who sent him out.

388
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:38,242
Couldn't you tell that I was being
kinder than usual?

389
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:39,160
Solidarity.

390
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:43,831
I will treat that patient.
You can treat this fake patient.

391
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,964
I'm really hurt.

392
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:54,092
I really got injured.

393
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:55,676
I never said anything.

394
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:58,262
I'll treat you.

395
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:02,100
Are you going to keep holding my wrist?

396
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:10,024
What's up with this calmness?

397
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,446
Are you okay?

398
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,032
Let go.

399
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,118
What should we do with this bastard?

400
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:21,536
Let me go!

401
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,122
I told you not to touch me.

402
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:29,460
Everybody looks fine. Right?

403
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:32,255
Look, he is alive.

404
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:34,090
Everything is good now, right?

405
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:36,134
What's the problem?

406
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,060
Let go of me!

407
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:50,273
Oh, my God, blood!

408
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,526
Hey!

409
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:58,865
You're so cool.

410
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:11,294
It stings a lot.

411
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,136
Are you deliberately making it sting?

412
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,972
Are you only good at surgeries?
Ow, that stings.

413
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:29,187
I came out alive
and you don't even answer me.

414
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,564
You're so cold.

415
00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:42,909
Why are you making this a joke?

416
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:45,703
You really almost died.

417
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:55,504
I told you that it stings a lot just now.

418
00:36:57,715 --> 00:37:01,719
I was really scared
that you might have died.

419
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,728
I trusted in you and went in.

420
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:15,399
You wouldn't let me die, would you?

421
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:19,111
Do you risk your life every time?

422
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:21,364
I'm a man who is good at his job.

423
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:25,701
And part of my job is not getting killed.

424
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:34,961
-Captain, the Lieutenant Colonel is here!
-Right now? Where is he?

425
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:37,630
Lie down. He can't order
a patient to come to him.

426
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,298
The Lieutenant Colonel can.

427
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:41,634
Until you get all the IV fluid, stay put.

428
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:44,804
If you want to keep doing
your beloved work of risking your life,

429
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:46,472
you better lie down.

430
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:51,686
Ask the Lieutenant Colonel to come here
if he needs to talk to the Captain.

431
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,398
Are you telling me to ask?

432
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:58,025
-Do you want to send him to detention?
-What?

433
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:02,196
-Solidarity.
-At ease.

434
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:05,783
-Are you hurt badly?
-No, sir.

435
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:07,076
Yes, he is.

436
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:10,288
I am definitely hurt badly, sir.

437
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:17,753
Haesung Hospital will send a plane
for the team in two days.

438
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:21,424
Prepare for them to go to the airport
at 13:00 the day after tomorrow.

439
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:25,094
Team Leader, please prepare
a list of passengers and let me know.

440
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:26,012
Yes, sir.

441
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:38,733
Look here...

442
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:42,403
Two flowers!
Are you the Lieutenant Colonel?

443
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:45,114
Come and talk to me for a moment.

444
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:50,036
See this? Do you see?

445
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:52,997
Do you see this?

446
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:59,337
You are mooching a salary
off of my hard-earned taxes.

447
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:03,924
How dare a soldier hit a civilian?

448
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:07,762
I only did it for a reason.

449
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:10,222
The living have to live, don't they?

450
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:15,644
Look, I will not let this pass easily.

451
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,773
Once I get my medical records,
I'll file a complaint

452
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:21,692
with the Defense Ministry, Blue House,
and my lawyers!

453
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:24,487
I'm going to file complaints
against you all.

454
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:28,032
I'm going to strip you all
of your uniforms, so be prepared.

455
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:31,327
I'll take care of this legally.

456
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,996
Yes, let's do this in line with the law.

457
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,247
Good.

458
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:39,835
You were at a restricted military area,
a civilian rescue site,

459
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:42,713
and almost killed people
with your excavator.

460
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:44,507
Let's see what the law says.

461
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:48,177
After your complaint is filed,
I'll take you to the military trial

462
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,721
for gross negligence
and attempted murder.

463
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,515
Make copies of your medical records.

464
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:54,934
I'm not a soldier.

465
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:56,227
Oh, really?

466
00:39:56,727 --> 00:40:01,190
You punks, while mooching salaries
off of hard-earned tax payers,

467
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:04,235
what were you doing allowing a civilian
to run amok at a rescue site?

468
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:05,736
Pack your bags immediately!

469
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:07,988
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

470
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:10,616
100 laps around the base.

471
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:11,784
Except the patient.

472
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:14,578
Yoo Si-jin, you finish getting your IV.

473
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:15,663
Yes, sir.

474
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:17,373
When you finish, you do 200 laps.

475
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:23,254
I'll run the laps with
my comrades right now.

476
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:28,217
In one line.

477
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:32,888
Wait... but...

478
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:36,475
you two are the ones who hit him.
Why am I...

479
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:39,687
I can't contain my curiosity.

480
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:42,022
If my wrist was okay,
I would've beaten--

481
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,316
-Me?
-That asshole.

482
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:46,861
The timing is weird.

483
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:49,488
Why did you only beat him lightly
if it was going to cause this situation?

484
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:51,615
You should have beat him up
until he couldn't speak.

485
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:54,326
The timing is weird.

486
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:56,537
Count how many laps we've done.

487
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,038
We've ran seven laps.

488
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,957
Already 27 laps? Oh, my!

489
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,168
No. Seven.

490
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:05,463
If the person who graduated from
the academy says 27, then it's 27!

491
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:07,131
Yes, I understand.

492
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:14,555
I have to consult my doctor.

493
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:16,515
I could die like this.

494
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:22,646
You took the IV out.

495
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:26,484
I wasn't lying when I said
you needed rest.

496
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:28,569
Then, you shouldn't have come.

497
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:32,031
You're the person
who prevents me from resting.

498
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,284
Why did you have to run laps?

499
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,870
I didn't do anything wrong.

500
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:40,748
But it's an order, right?

501
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:46,170
That group you're in is
very unfair and inflexible.

502
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:47,963
It's proof that rules exist.

503
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:51,550
I wish you would exist
more than the rules.

504
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:54,595
Take this 30 minutes after a meal.

505
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:03,979
Thank you for saving me.

506
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:07,733
I'll give you the list of personnel
set for departure later.

507
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:11,195
Has the list been made?

508
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,197
I'm on my way to discuss it.

509
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:19,578
Are you on that list as well?

510
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,042
Are you on it?

511
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:30,130
It's an opportunity
for me to leave you behind.

512
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:56,282
Everyone's here, right?

513
00:42:57,366 --> 00:43:00,703
A flight has been scheduled
for the return of the medical team

514
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:02,538
in the afternoon, the day after tomorrow.

515
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:06,208
The volunteering period is over,

516
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:08,961
and you can all go back now.

517
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:12,423
Or, you could stay...

518
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:18,429
After this place, I don't know
when the next one will come.

519
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:22,683
Until yesterday,
we'd endured this mess,

520
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:25,269
but today, we have a choice.

521
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:28,314
Raise your hands if you want to stay.

522
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:37,114
The patient with a concussion
in bed eight needs an MRI.

523
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:40,993
Please use my seat for transporting
that patient to Korea.

524
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:47,708
Ha Ja-ae! How could you raise your hand?

525
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:51,295
Please give my seat to
the patient in bed ten.

526
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:56,050
I have a patient to check right now,
so I'll be going.

527
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:02,681
Why are you all like this?

528
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:05,100
If they leave like that,
what becomes of us?

529
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:11,357
Professor, I'm really sorry,
but I want to leave.

530
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,693
Yes, we should leave. Let's leave.

531
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:16,820
It's nothing to be sorry about.

532
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:18,739
For the rest of you as well,

533
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,407
don't leave with a heavy heart.

534
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:23,827
You went above and beyond
what was expected of you.

535
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:27,456
Those who will be going back,
please raise your hands comfortably.

536
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:38,008
You can raise your hand.

537
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:39,760
Why call me out specifically?

538
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:41,470
I'm not leaving!

539
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:47,017
Leave my seat empty.

540
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:49,603
My soul will sit there.

541
00:44:56,443 --> 00:45:00,114
Where is Dr. Lee Chi-hoon?

542
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:12,543
Ow, I'm itchy.

543
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:16,255
Ugh, sand.

544
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:33,772
Hey!

545
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:36,817
You told me you were a doctor.

546
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:38,819
But, you can't be?

547
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:43,824
Those who leave their patients behind
aren't considered to be doctors.

548
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:58,464
What are you doing? You didn't hear
that we're having a meeting?

549
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,049
I'm sorry.

550
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:05,095
They said you discovered that patient.

551
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:08,015
You did something great, Lee Chi-hoon.

552
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,770
Our return flight has been arranged.

553
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:15,397
Some are staying, and some are leaving.

554
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:18,192
I put you on the list, so just leave.

555
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:21,862
Doctor Jang is nearing her due date.
Go and be there with her.

556
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:24,364
Yes.

557
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:30,746
What's happened to your hand?

558
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:36,960
Bro.

559
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:38,712
Yes?

560
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:40,297
Have you seen Manager Ko?

561
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:42,424
I barely escaped death.

562
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:44,301
Where is that old geezer?

563
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:47,721
He wasn't even worrying about me?

564
00:46:49,014 --> 00:46:49,932
There.

565
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:00,317
LIST OF FATALITIES
COLLISION SITE

566
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,612
KO JAE-EUL, MALE, AGE 54, CRUSH INJURY

567
00:47:06,114 --> 00:47:07,658
That old man.

568
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:11,620
You said you would live
with a safety helmet.

569
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:14,540
That's how I lived.

570
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:18,460
I listened to you for the first time...

571
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:22,756
How can you do this to me?

572
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,968
How could this happen?

573
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:28,428
Why?

574
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:43,110
Why did you do this?

575
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:08,218
This is the Company Commander
of  Mowuru Company.

576
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:10,304
I'll brief you on the search.

577
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:13,765
One survivor is being treated

578
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:16,685
and two have been confirmed as dead.

579
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:21,440
There are no more missing persons
at the plant site.

580
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:26,612
As of 11:00 today,
all efforts to rescue survivors

581
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:29,197
at the Mowuru Energy Plant have
officially ended.

582
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:33,035
You all tried your best during
this unexpected disaster.

583
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:38,123
Haesung Hospital's medical team
and the Taebaek Division

584
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:39,875
thank you all for the hard work.

585
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:43,337
-Good work.
-Good work.

586
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:53,847
Starting now, this power plant will be
solely managed by 

587
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:55,599
the Uruk Energy Company.

588
00:48:56,224 --> 00:49:00,228
Whether I dig ground or build a palace,

589
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:03,649
if I see even a trace of a soldier
or a doctor, I will...

590
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:08,612
What's that sound?

591
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:13,909
Four days ago at this time,
an earthquake occurred.

592
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:20,582
Starting today, a siren will sound
at this hour to commemorate the victims.

593
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:24,586
When the siren goes off,
stop what you're doing.

594
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:28,966
And have a moment of silence
to pray for the victims.

595
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:33,845
Squad, Attention.

596
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:45,899
All, take a moment of silence.

597
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:00,998
MEMORIAL FOR THE VICTIMS
OF THE ENERGY PLANT COLLAPSE

598
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:10,924
We're relatively used to death,
since we see a lot of it at the hospital,

599
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:14,386
but this situation was different.

600
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,722
Your body recovers as you rest,

601
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:19,099
but your emotions get damaged.

602
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,353
After all this, I'm thinking,
"What is there in life?

603
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:25,230
You don't know what might happen."

604
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:30,193
So when I go back to Korea,
I will be getting a new car.

605
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:32,362
What kind of car should I get?

606
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:34,823
Why are you asking me?

607
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:37,993
Why can't I ask you?

608
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:39,828
We went through so much together.

609
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:45,876
Ask her out! Ask her out!

610
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:47,544
Stop!

611
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:49,755
It's working.

612
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:51,506
-Really?
-Oh!

613
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,675
-Oh, really?
-It's really working now.

614
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:56,094
Communication is back up--

615
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:00,307
I guess you all know.

616
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:03,602
There was no signal,
but you were all carrying phones.

617
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:06,396
Solidarity.

618
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:12,569
My mother seems to be doing fine.

619
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:15,363
She is going around shopping,
so her legs must be fine.

620
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:17,616
She is drinking a lot of coffee,

621
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:19,493
so her social life is smooth.

622
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:21,787
My friends think they are so cool.

623
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:25,415
They didn't even ask me how I'm doing.
They just sent social media game invites.

624
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:28,293
Oh, crap. My ex-boyfriend.

625
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:30,295
He is getting married.

626
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:33,298
Why is he texting about that
when you're at the disaster site?

627
00:51:37,677 --> 00:51:38,553
Yeah.

628
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:43,350
We decided to evacuate the patients
for our four seats.

629
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:45,143
The manager knows the situation,

630
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:48,188
so please check those patients first
as needed.

631
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:51,233
How could you worry about
a patient?

632
00:51:51,316 --> 00:51:53,693
We sent the charter plane for you guys.

633
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:56,279
Both the TV show
and the VIP ward are in a panic.

634
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:59,282
What are you gonna do?
We have such a great heroine here.

635
00:51:59,991 --> 00:52:01,326
You are so right.

636
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:04,746
-I guess I was that kind of doctor.
-Don't go nuts saving humanity.

637
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:08,250
Return home the next chance you get.
You're the most important person to me.

638
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:11,253
Don't worry.

639
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:13,755
I am wrapping up all the dangerous duties.

640
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:17,717
Is Lee Chi-hoon playing around
over there?

641
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:21,513
Dr. Jang is driving me crazy whining
about him not answering her calls!

642
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,809
How can he be so handsome

643
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:10,979
in this hard and exhausting disaster site?

644
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:14,524
I am just thankful of his existence here.

645
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:17,944
And he is fixing things just like that.

646
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:28,079
Is this not working?

647
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:29,122
Yes.

648
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:34,753
Oh, no. It won't turn on.

649
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:37,964
I heard that you are good at
fixing this kind of stuff.

650
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:41,676
You came to the right place. I am good at
working on both people and machines. 

651
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,430
I am pretty much good at fixing anything.
The only thing I can't seem to fix is...

652
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:47,265
a woman's heart.

653
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:48,850
Oh, my!

654
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:02,739
Hey!

655
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:09,412
There's a difference
between a man and a woman.

656
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:12,082
What is this?

657
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:14,584
Okay. You may all be dismissed.

658
00:54:15,168 --> 00:54:18,171
This doesn't look good.
Why don't we all leave?

659
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:22,634
Did you get to talk to your father?

660
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:26,471
With my father, no news is good news.

661
00:54:27,305 --> 00:54:28,682
What about you?

662
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:34,396
You wouldn't need to, she is already here.
You saved your phone bill.

663
00:54:34,479 --> 00:54:38,775
I don't know how long it's been since
we've been together at the same unit.

664
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:41,903
Only disasters like earthquakes
can keep us together.

665
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:43,405
So I'm telling you,

666
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:46,449
you should start making a baby.

667
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:52,789
The Commander wants to talk
to his son in law...

668
00:55:05,593 --> 00:55:08,763
How can you hang up
on the Commander like that?

669
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:10,223
I just hung up on my dad, sir.

670
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:11,599
Son in law...?

671
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:17,147
He must have said "Captain"
and you misheard, right?

672
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:18,940
They say not to trust anyone.

673
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:20,942
Do you guys play around like this
when you're alone?

674
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:23,278
We've never messed around together.

675
00:55:23,361 --> 00:55:25,280
Doesn't it look like he is being jealous?

676
00:55:25,363 --> 00:55:26,197
Not now!

677
00:55:29,075 --> 00:55:32,037
First lieutenant Yoon said
the wrong thing.

678
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:35,498
Why are you only picking on me?
You can't say anything to her!

679
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:38,543
You are such a coward.

680
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:41,796
I better go, so I can get treatment.

681
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:45,425
My heart is hurting so much.

682
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:04,527
Do you always come into the room
while he is alone?

683
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:07,113
So, you were jealous.

684
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:10,283
-Try more of that.
-What will you do if I'm jealous?

685
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:12,786
I will give you a good reward.

686
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:15,747
I look forward to it.

687
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:27,258
You really did fix it.

688
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:32,263
I will make the playlist then.

689
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:33,681
That's fine by me.

690
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:29,946
We're the only ones here.

691
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:33,283
The music is playing too.

692
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:36,828
Don't you think this is a bit romantic?

693
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:43,543
How can you just not do anything?

694
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:45,920
Don't you think
you should be doing something?

695
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:48,256
-Yes, I do.
-See, what did I tell you?

696
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:58,266
Go ahead and do it.

697
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:08,109
I think that I should go do roll call.

698
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:10,570
Solidarity.

699
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:32,425
What's the next song?

700
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:35,053
I am not sure, because Dr. Kang made
the playlist.

701
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:39,891
If I had known that I would die here,

702
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:43,311
I would have lived a carefree life
instead of trying to be a professor.

703
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:47,357
Are you coming, Yoo Si-jin?

704
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:50,944
You are not coming.

705
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:53,738
I don't think I can last
until you get here.

706
00:58:58,576 --> 00:58:59,661
Even so...

707
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:04,457
you will be the first to find me if I die.

708
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:10,171
You know what?

709
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:12,924
If I knew I would die like this,

710
00:59:13,591 --> 00:59:17,345
I would have told you my true feelings.

711
00:59:18,846 --> 00:59:22,016
I got kissed from this wonderful man.

712
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:25,270
My heart flutters all the time
because of that.

713
00:59:56,801 --> 01:00:00,096
Doesn't it seem like a shame to go to bed?
Want to have ramen with me?

714
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:02,515
It's not like I'm asking
for three times a day.

715
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:05,184
I want a romantic movie,
but we end up in an action one.

716
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:08,187
You've ruined two cars already,
let's ruin your lipstick, too.

717
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:10,356
You met Seo Dae-yeong again.
Do you like him?

718
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,358
-Yes, that's right.
-Seo Dae-yeong...

719
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:14,861
They sell humans, kidnap kids...

720
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:21,701
