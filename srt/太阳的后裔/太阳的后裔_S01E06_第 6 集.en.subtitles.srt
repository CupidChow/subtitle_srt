1
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,657
Then let me ask you one thing

2
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:34,743
since this might be the last time.

3
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:37,245
It's about that kiss.

4
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:40,040
-I told you not to bring that up--
-What should I do?

5
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:44,377
Should I apologize?

6
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:47,505
Or confess my love?

7
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:01,853
You are really amazing.

8
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,942
You're amazing, but you're too dangerous.

9
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,987
And because you're dangerous,
I don't like it.

10
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,325
But every moment
our eyes have met has been charming.

11
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,119
I'm going to have to stand you up.

12
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:21,414
You're leaving?

13
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:26,127
Did something happen?

14
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:29,047
-I think I have to go.
-Now?

15
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:30,507
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,928
I can't say any more details
because of the rules.

17
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,639
-Was he your colleague?
-We were comrades.

18
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:41,017
So what you're saying is you too...

19
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,185
So let's not...

20
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,606
talk about that.

21
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:52,487
That's why I wish we had more time.

22
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:56,491
So I could sort out
my complicated  thoughts

23
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:58,201
and get rid of those fears.

24
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:01,121
Even though it's dangerous,

25
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:04,624
should I date this amazing man?

26
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:06,709
I needed time to think.

27
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:12,298
But, Yoo Si-jin,

28
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,176
you seem to always leave too soon.

29
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,805
I can't argue with you over
why you always do this.

30
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,016
I can't even beg for you to stay.

31
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:27,188
I feel like a fool
for weighing in on it alone.

32
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,858
And now I just...

33
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,696
resent you.

34
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:40,785
Please apologize.
I'll accept your apology.

35
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:53,089
I'm sorry. Please take care of yourself.

36
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:56,551
Solidarity.

37
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:56,486
One, two, three, four!

38
00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:01,157
One, two, three, four!

39
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:16,798
Oh, hello!

40
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:21,010
Where is Captain Yoo?
He wasn't in the Commander's office.

41
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,179
He left last night.

42
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,140
He had to take a civilian flight.

43
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,726
It should have departed by now.

44
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:31,479
Solidarity.

45
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,778
Wow. So heartless.

46
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:58,881
EPISODE 6

47
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:03,678
Wow, this photo is still here.

48
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,221
Father.

49
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,851
Like your mother said,
you should've been a lawyer or a judge.

50
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:13,062
Who recognizes soldiers these days?

51
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:18,401
If only I had brains,
but since I was born athletic

52
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,486
it would have been a waste.

53
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,157
Sergeant Major Yoo
must stay healthy and live a long life.

54
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:28,077
Wait till I becomes a General
and we can take a picture.

55
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:32,415
Who says they'll put stars on someone
like you with no connections?

56
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,626
What a joke.
You weren't even able to make it to Major.

57
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,339
Are you okay?

58
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,299
I just did as you taught me.

59
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,217
Please be proud of me.

60
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,844
When you're a soldier...

61
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:48,681
sometimes being in confinement
is more honorable than being promoted.

62
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:51,809
Well done.

63
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,606
I'm ready. Please come in.

64
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:01,110
Please go in. I'll bring mother in.

65
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:02,653
Okay.

66
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,705
Here you go.

67
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:15,333
One, two, three.

68
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,048
Trainee number 17, ready to descend.

69
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:24,175
Descending now.

70
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,851
Please save me!

71
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,437
Save me!

72
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:42,902
Down, up, down, up.

73
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:46,239
Down, up, get down.

74
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,159
One, two, up!

75
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,829
Your body looks fine, so is it your brain?

76
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,164
-No, sir.
-Exchange mission.

77
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,499
Exchange mission.

78
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:07,510
-Do you want to kill your instructor?
-Yes, sir.

79
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,303
Your body is not capable.

80
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:12,390
You have 30 seconds. Run to the back
of the guardhouse. Left face.

81
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,728
If you see me outside, I'll take off
my rank and we can fight anytime.

82
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,981
Let's get stronger today! Run!

83
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:21,858
Go!

84
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,947
Super-good-looking trainee.

85
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:31,576
Ready to descend. Descending now!

86
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,001
Put me down.

87
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:53,055
Cut it out, trainee.
Hurry up and come down.

88
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:58,728
Look closely.
That is an airborne posture.

89
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,700
You're on leave. What are you doing?

90
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,827
What can I say? I miss you.

91
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:16,496
When do you get off?

92
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:19,332
Hurry up and finish so
we can have a drink.

93
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:24,003
Did your father's retirement ceremony
go well?

94
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:26,797
It was touching
when he got all the flower bouquets.

95
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:30,510
-It's good to see you healthy. Solidarity.
-Solidarity.

96
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:37,350
Hey, hey. It's been
a year since we got together, right?

97
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:41,479
Let's order a ton of soju.
And get a round of shots.

98
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:46,609
A round? Let's drink until we die!

99
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:50,112
-Do you know them?
-I gave them a monstrous training before.

100
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,533
It's all right.

101
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:55,868
I don't look anything like a soldier.

102
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:59,288
Don't raise your collar.
Anyone can tell you're a soldier.

103
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,791
Oh? Master Sergeant Seo?

104
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:06,587
Isn't this Master Sergeant Seo?

105
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,048
Looks like the disguise failed.

106
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,467
Do you have an exit plan?

107
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,636
Look towards 5 o'clock.

108
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:18,766
That's him. It's the Monster Trainer Seo.

109
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:20,810
Do you remember me?

110
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:25,439
Didn't you promise us in every training?

111
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:29,694
If we meet outside of class,
we can take off our ranks and fight.

112
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,654
I said, "If we meet outside."

113
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:34,782
This isn't outside. This is inside.

114
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,577
Why are you asking already?
We just met here.

115
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:42,206
Really, you guys...

116
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:46,419
It would be nice to keep
such fond memories in your heart.

117
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,131
Fond memories in my heart?

118
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:53,301
-Run on the count of three. One...
-Three!

119
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,858
Is today military day?

120
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:10,735
Get them!

121
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:15,906
At 2 o'clock. Three!

122
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,950
No, no, this isn't it!

123
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,180
Stop there! Stop right there!

124
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:22,431
Catch them!

125
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,183
That way!

126
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:41,158
This way, this way! Over there!

127
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,918
You count very strangely.
When does three come after one?

128
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:55,715
It's because I only did sports.
You should have counted, college boy.

129
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,134
Gosh, those punks.

130
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,930
I guess the mighty instructor
from Hell has his time too.

131
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,518
Is now the time?
I should give it to you too.

132
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:11,647
Do you remember how you put me through
all that stuff during the academy?

133
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,442
I do remember. Do we go at it now?

134
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:21,574
I don't remember.
I only have memories of being happy.

135
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,535
That sobered me up.

136
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,541
Did you have the wine I left behind?

137
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,293
I did taste it.

138
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:33,919
Did you drink it alone?

139
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:35,671
I drank with Dr. Kang.

140
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,340
Is it going well?

141
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:40,593
It didn't go well.

142
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:44,722
I always seem to get dumped
when I'm on vacation.

143
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:52,521
I still think about her a little,
but I will be okay soon.

144
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:56,066
There's nobody who doesn't give in
after ten tries.

145
00:12:56,609 --> 00:13:00,738
That's coming from someone
who hasn't even tried once out of ten.

146
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:06,285
It isn't that I haven't tried.
I just don't give in myself.

147
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:10,164
I think we might be fools.

148
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:14,001
I think us being together creates
some synergy.

149
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:20,174
I'll be going now.

150
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,301
Where are you going?

151
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:25,179
I'm going home.
This is my neighborhood.

152
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:34,146
Did you come this way on purpose?

153
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:36,273
Is this how you save money on taxis?

154
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,067
Enjoy your leave. Solidarity.

155
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:45,533
Aren't you even going to offer me
some ramen since your house is nearby?

156
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:02,258
YOON MYEONG-JU

157
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,691
Hello? Hello?

158
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,736
Seo Dae-yeong,
did you just answer my call?

159
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,533
You really answered!

160
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:32,037
Why did you answer? What's wrong?

161
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,253
Say something since
you already picked up.

162
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:47,052
Never mind. Okay, just listen then.

163
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:50,347
Just don't hang up. Got it?

164
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:59,648
I'm keeping my uniform on. That's why
I haven't been bitten by mosquitoes.

165
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:05,487
I'm healthy in this unit
and I miss you so much.

166
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,076
Did you meet Yoo Si-jin?

167
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,579
He teased me so much.

168
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:16,749
He said I must love you a lot
to chase you all the way here.

169
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:20,669
That everything about me is pretty,
especially the fact I have no pride.

170
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,549
It doesn't matter
if I don't have any pride

171
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:29,303
when Seo Dae-yeong loved me so much.

172
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,003
Are you listening?

173
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,926
If you're listening,
at least let me hear you breathing.

174
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:23,732
It's your leave soon, isn't it? Come
quickly, I found a man with good wine.

175
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,776
I don't drink with women.

176
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:28,779
Find me a man, too. A good one.

177
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:33,242
What about your halfway-round-the-world
destiny? Not so great seeing him again?

178
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:44,420
No, he was the best.

179
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,298
I shouldn't have accepted his apology.

180
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,801
I should have run after him and held on.

181
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,262
I should have held onto him
and confessed my love.

182
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:59,226
He probably thinks I'm not worth it

183
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:03,981
since I missed all those chances.

184
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,140
Hey, hey!

185
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,841
There you go.

186
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,071
You can do basic translation, right?

187
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,700
If you suck on these,
your stomach will hurt a lot.

188
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:23,328
Promise me you won't suck
on these anymore.

189
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,164
Got it?

190
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:30,335
If you suck on these, you'll be shot.

191
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:39,094
You must wash your hands before you eat.

192
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:44,141
If you don't wash your
hands before eating,

193
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:46,351
you'll be shot.

194
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,654
Why are the children laughing?
Are you interpreting it strangely?

195
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,449
They're just at that age.

196
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:25,766
Solidarity.

197
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:28,227
Where is your current location?

198
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:31,563
-I am at the unit.
-I came to Yangpyeong to go fishing.

199
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,942
Ah, the mountain and the water is good.

200
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:36,985
There's no other healing like it.

201
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:38,779
Then why did you call?

202
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:42,532
I'm bored.

203
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:45,369
Can't you come here?

204
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:50,040
-It's scary to fish at night, too.
-Bye.

205
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,595
Something big happened, Sergeant Seo!

206
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:33,208
I don't do surgery anymore.

207
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:36,128
Apparently surgical experience
doesn't count toward a career.

208
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,089
I'm going to go back soon
and when I go back,

209
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:41,883
I have to go right back to where I was,

210
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,593
so I'm very busy.

211
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:46,888
Is that right?

212
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:54,604
Here.

213
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:02,362
I thought you'd come back here
before I will

214
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:08,994
Check to see if you really can come back.

215
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,013
No way.

216
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:12,307
Yes, it's the same car.

217
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:15,018
It's a wasted skill for a doctor.

218
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:18,063
That's why I like
the hardware store better.

219
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,274
I heard you're leaving today.

220
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:24,569
Yes. Thank you for everything.

221
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:30,367
It might not cover more than the parts,
but I wanted to at least do this.

222
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,452
If you really feel that way,

223
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:36,498
would you rather pay it back
at $10 a month?

224
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:42,045
I would like that.
I'll pay back in installments.

225
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:45,090
Thank you. Have a wonderful life.

226
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:47,342
If you want to suffer a little,
give me a call.

227
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,847
Volunteering, relief activities,
or something like that...

228
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:55,016
I think this was enough for one lifetime.

229
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:57,894
I need to go back to my place.

230
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,772
Are you going to stay here, Daniel?

231
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,693
I'm on sabbatical, so it seems like
I'll be here for this year.

232
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:08,238
But who knows? This job
doesn't let me stay put for long.

233
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:09,990
Get back safely.

234
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:14,327
Be healthy.
Send my regards to Ye-hwa too.

235
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,404
Everyone's waiting for you.
What are you doing?

236
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:52,908
You've got five minutes.
Why didn't you start five minutes ago?

237
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:58,163
HepatAmine, Huriamin...

238
00:24:58,246 --> 00:25:00,415
I may not see you again,
can I ask something?

239
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:01,875
No.

240
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,419
Where's the box of IVs...

241
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,087
Do you like Si-jin?

242
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:14,804
What an obvious answer. Very well, then.

243
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:17,974
What did you hear? I didn't say anything.

244
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:20,602
You did. With your whole body.

245
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,021
Wait a second.

246
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,609
It's Si-jin.

247
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:30,278
Good timing.

248
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:33,198
Kang Mo-yeon... this person...

249
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:36,576
Our rank hasn't been settled,
so I'm not sure what to call her.

250
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,828
Does this doctor like you?

251
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:40,121
Hey, Yoon Myeong-ju!

252
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:48,463
I called you, and you don't even state
your name and rank?

253
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:52,175
Why did you call?
Did you call as a supervisor or senior?

254
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:56,179
Right now, I'm your neighborhood brother.
I'm drinking coffee with Sergeant Seo.

255
00:25:56,805 --> 00:26:00,308
Latte for me, espresso for him.

256
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:03,520
I don't know if he knows
what he's drinking.

257
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,233
He knows. I taught him.

258
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,822
What were you talking about?

259
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:16,533
I was just trying to embarrass her.

260
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:20,245
I'm in psychological warfare
with my acquaintance, Kang Mo-yeon.

261
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:21,871
Acquaintance?

262
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,542
Why are you bothering a civilian?

263
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:27,877
So you've changed the subject.

264
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:30,338
Curious about my acquaintance's reaction?

265
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,008
I'll kill you! Hang up!

266
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:36,344
How is it? Is she mad?

267
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:39,556
She is mad, but still pretty.
Maybe it's the way she's dressed.

268
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:45,103
Good luck. Bye.

269
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:46,062
Solidarity.

270
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:50,025
I thought he would ask for you,
but he hung up.

271
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:52,944
-That must mean he was perplexed.
-Of course.

272
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:56,197
He won't forget my face that quickly.

273
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:02,746
-Is that why he likes you?
-Medical Team! Medical Team!

274
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:07,167
Let's all get together for a picture.

275
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:11,921
Go get your picture taken.
You came here for that.

276
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:14,424
-Team Leader Kang!
-I'm coming.

277
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:20,096
I came here to do that,
but that's not the only thing I came for.

278
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:23,141
I couldn't do everything
since you started chatting.

279
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:25,310
So you can check the supplies.

280
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:27,687
Make sure you give
the U.N. a smooth transition.

281
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:30,940
And stay safe until you go back.

282
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:41,701
-We're really done here.
-Let's go home! Yay!

283
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:48,291
Here you go! One, two, three.

284
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:55,423
Yes!

285
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:58,051
Thanks for all your hard work.

286
00:27:58,134 --> 00:28:01,429
-Good work!
-Thank you!

287
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:04,808
To thank you, the division commander,

288
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:07,102
has provided helicopter transportation.

289
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,609
We don't have to ride
the bus for four hours?

290
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:18,405
We will get you to Uruk Airport
in under 30 minutes.

291
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:25,495
Due to limited space,
we will send a group of people first...

292
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:27,163
Rock-paper-scissors!

293
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:34,671
Rock, paper, scissors!

294
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:38,675
-Come on!
-Hurry up!

295
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,969
Rock, paper, scissors!

296
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:48,101
Wow! It's really amazing!

297
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:50,311
It's so beautiful!

298
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:54,149
We didn't get to see this
until we were leaving. Too bad.

299
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:56,568
Look at the color of that water, wow.

300
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:59,571
People need to live seeing
these great sights.

301
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:01,781
We shouldn't be locked
in the operating room,

302
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:07,120
looking at intestines, colons,
or duodena all day long...

303
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:09,581
Captain Yoo always used to say this,

304
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:13,376
but when we look at this,
it's a country we want to protect.

305
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:31,538
This should do.

306
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,180
Hurry it up!

307
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:01,526
You're so good looking. I--

308
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:04,529
Manager, sheesh!

309
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:06,155
Sleep monster, Mr. Kang.

310
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:10,493
Safety hat. Safety hat on site.

311
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:13,621
Why aren't you wearing it?

312
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:16,124
My hair is going to get messed up.

313
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:21,963
Keep doing that until your head
blows up and you'll croak, you  rascal.

314
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:37,228
Next, I need bowls...

315
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:43,151
Where are the bowls...

316
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:55,997
Earthquake! Get out!

317
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,314
The hat! The hat!

318
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:04,983
Get out!

319
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,468
Manager!

320
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:06,044
What? What in the world is this?

321
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:25,021
URUK 6.7 MAGNITUDE EARTHQUAKE

322
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,612
Communication Network Headquarters

323
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:34,739
This is Captain Yoo Si-jin of Team Alpha.

324
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:38,242
Put on anyone who knows about
the situation at Mowuru Company.

325
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:39,911
Do not hang up. Do it now.

326
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:52,215
Yesterday at 4:00 p.m....

327
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:56,594
Yes, the aid group is scheduled to fly
home today, but we can't reach them.

328
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:58,638
Yes. Yes, I understand.

329
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:03,810
This earthquake took place 200 km
outside Uruk in the region of Mowuru.

330
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:07,146
The shaking was said to have been felt
in the capital.

331
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:11,109
Oh no. What about my Chi-hoon?

332
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:14,904
It's okay. It will be okay.
Nothing bad will happen.

333
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:18,866
I just saw the news too.
How am I supposed to know?

334
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:22,453
I'm going into an emergency briefing
now so I'll let you know if there's news.

335
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:25,998
The injury and death toll are currently
being investigated.

336
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:27,708
KBS news, Reporter Hwang.

337
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,837
We are able to contact headquarters,
but are still unable to locate

338
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,089
Lieutenant Yoon Myeong-ju
at the Mowuru site.

339
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:37,093
-The aircraft request from the Air Force?
-Ready for takeoff in ten minutes.

340
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:39,095
We will use all channels to locate--

341
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:41,430
There is no time to waste on a lieutenant.

342
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:43,015
Don't do anything useless.

343
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:45,768
Seo Dae-yeong's been left out of
the deployment

344
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:47,019
Summon him and add him.

345
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:51,858
Sergeant Seo Dae-yeong submitted
a request to volunteer and is on standby.

346
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,112
-Did you get a car ready?
-Yes, I did.

347
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,793
How many times do I have to tell you?

348
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:13,588
Personnel aboard the helicopter
must go home first.

349
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:16,757
You should leave while you can.

350
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,801
Why do I have to repeat myself?

351
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:20,928
Do you want to keep wasting time?

352
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,181
We'll take full responsibility,
take us there!

353
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:27,310
I can't. Please go. As ordered--

354
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:29,228
I'm responsible for the medical team.

355
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:33,149
If this is an earthquake, we are the ones
most needed at the site.

356
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:34,817
We have colleagues here as well.

357
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,195
We can't return home without them.

358
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:38,779
You keep going against orders!

359
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:44,285
I really don't like this.
Do you know that?

360
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:47,163
You already told us.
Let's talk about it while we move.

361
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:53,169
What is the status of central
rescue dispatch?

362
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:56,339
It's a region still under dispute.

363
00:36:57,423 --> 00:37:00,384
Legally, it's difficult to dispatch
civilian officials.

364
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:03,804
Saying "we can't" and "it's difficult"
isn't getting anything done!

365
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,933
Our medical team that went there
for volunteer aid

366
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:09,477
are still unaccounted for!

367
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:13,314
This is Lieutenant General Yoon Gil-jun
of Special Task Command.

368
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:17,276
My troops will rescue civilians first.

369
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,862
I promise you that we'll use
whatever method possible.

370
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:21,656
I'm asking what you're going to do!

371
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:24,617
If something bad happens
to our medical team...

372
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:31,540
If it's money, our Haesung Group will
provide it, whatever the amount.

373
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,544
Let's just do something, quickly.

374
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:40,216
The fastest C-17 tactical transport
aircraft will depart Suwon Airport

375
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:42,760
in 30 minutes, at exactly 01:00.

376
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:45,554
On the aircraft, we have
the most experienced members

377
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:49,392
of our special task force.

378
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,315
Did you withdraw from your leave?

379
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:00,778
I'm only doing what needs to be done,

380
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,531
you can still respect me for it.

381
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,214
Ja-ae!

382
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:23,342
Ja-ae! Ja-ae!

383
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:27,596
Where's Han Ja-ae? Han Ja-ae!

384
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,683
Be quiet! I'm right here.

385
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:33,227
Why did you come back? You didn't leave?

386
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:38,024
Are you all right?
If you're okay, it's okay.

387
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,735
Are you all right? Was anybody injured?

388
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:43,404
It shook quite a bit,
but fortunately everyone is okay.

389
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:46,741
The phones won't connect,
and we couldn't contact anyone.

390
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,327
I was scared to death.

391
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:52,413
It's okay, don't cry.

392
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:54,040
It's lucky everyone is alright.

393
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:57,752
First, let's not spread out. Standby here.
I'll try to get in contact with Seoul.

394
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:03,632
How is his condition?

395
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:07,428
Dislocated shoulder, but fortunately
the army doctor popped it back in.

396
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:11,390
It's nothing much. I'm fine.

397
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:15,770
The barracks personnel didn't
suffer major injuries.

398
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:19,315
But why did you return?
Is it more severe near the airport?

399
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,068
Really? The planes aren't taking off?

400
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:24,570
There's nothing major near the airport.

401
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:27,448
We couldn't even reach you.
How could we leave?

402
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:29,700
That's why we returned.

403
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:34,872
That's a relief.
I thought we couldn't go home.

404
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:39,293
Medi Cube, is there an army doctor?
Army Doctor!

405
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:42,046
This is First Lieutenant Yoon. What is it?

406
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:44,757
This is the plant site.

407
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:46,884
...collapsed.

408
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,887
What did you say? I can't hear you.

409
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:53,140
The power plant is down!

410
00:39:58,521 --> 00:39:59,814
Oh, no!

411
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:06,213
Put on your medical vests,
so the patients can identify you.

412
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,923
You know the triage color system?

413
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:10,217
Green for wounded,
yellow for observation.

414
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,928
Patients that need immediate treatment
are tagged red.

415
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:18,517
Critical patients that can't be treated
on site tag black, the color for deceased.

416
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:21,479
Do not treat the patients with black tags.

417
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,939
We focus on patients who can live.

418
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:26,650
Should we get prescription orders
for morphine or Demerol?

419
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:28,819
It's impossible to send
an order each time.

420
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:31,822
Make the best judgment
given the circumstances.

421
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:34,492
Please take the best course of action
possible.

422
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:36,076
Okay, let's go now.

423
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:06,857
Here!

424
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:16,951
-Are you alright?
-I'm fine. He's a patient.

425
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:20,079
Patient! Patient, can you hear me?

426
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:23,249
He has external hemorrhaging.
He has a pulse, but he's unconscious.

427
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:25,000
He's in a state of temporary shock.

428
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:26,752
Give him oxygen while getting an IV.

429
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:27,920
Okay.

430
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:42,434
Nurse.

431
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:45,271
How is his condition?

432
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:46,730
Doctor!

433
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:49,942
Ah, wait.

434
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:54,321
I'm the chief manager in charge of
this site.

435
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,365
Has the building investigation began yet?

436
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:57,825
The building keeps collapsing,

437
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:00,160
so we have stopped
any entry into the building.

438
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:01,954
Can you do a head count?

439
00:43:02,037 --> 00:43:03,455
We can't find Manager Ko.

440
00:43:04,873 --> 00:43:08,210
Well, he's in the afternoon shift.
So there must've been...

441
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,004
about 30-- How do I know!

442
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:11,714
-What?
-He is probably not out.

443
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:15,843
Let's do it like this for now.

444
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:20,014
I left something important
in the office, so...

445
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:23,183
-We need aid.
-I'm coming! Just wait!

446
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,310
-What?
-Please leave.

447
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:27,438
Hey, I just explained.
I have to get to the office! Hey!

448
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,649
Here!

449
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:32,401
Oh, my God!

450
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:34,903
It's upper GI bleeding.

451
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,282
Doctor Chi-hoon!

452
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:00,929
For the love of God,
this is driving me nuts!

453
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:05,809
Someone is here!
Why isn't anyone coming?

454
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,812
I said someone is here!

455
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:11,065
Someone is dying.

456
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:11,982
Manager?

457
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:17,154
I can't see. I can't see.

458
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:20,324
Hurry, hurry!

459
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:22,785
Hurry!

460
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:24,870
Who is it?

461
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:29,500
It's me. Don't worry.

462
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:33,128
Hurry. It hurts.

463
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:35,464
I'm going to die!

464
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:38,050
What is it? Are you hurt?

465
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:42,054
Are you very hurt?
Ah, seriously why can't I get out of this!

466
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,557
In any case, let's just wait.

467
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:48,394
Okay?

468
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:53,524
There's someone here!

469
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:56,902
Is anyone out there?

470
00:44:57,736 --> 00:45:01,323
Please save us!

471
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:12,084
I'll take care of this patient.
Please go over there.

472
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:16,547
There's a doctor though.

473
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:22,136
No, leave this with me and go.

474
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:29,810
How's his condition?

475
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:33,147
I still feel a pulse.

476
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:35,482
We can save him if we keep going.

477
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:54,793
Even though he has a mild pulse,

478
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:57,629
due to severe hemorrhaging,
he suffered a cardiac arrest.

479
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:00,883
I'm sorry to say,
but this patient is deceased.

480
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:02,426
No!

481
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:05,721
I can do it. I can save him.

482
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:10,434
Stop now.

483
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:17,232
-Time of death, Uruk time...
-Don't!

484
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:22,321
Wait, he was fine.

485
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:24,114
He was okay.

486
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:29,453
He wasn't in pain,
so we put a yellow tag on him.

487
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:31,789
I tagged this patient!

488
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:38,378
Pull yourself together. Can you do that?

489
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:40,380
Now is not the time.

490
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:44,134
Stop whining and act like a doctor.

491
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:48,847
What kind of doctor am I?

492
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:52,100
I can't even tag a patient properly.

493
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:55,687
What kind of doctor am I?

494
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:04,112
You are a doctor.
Someone who is desperately needed here.

495
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:06,698
You're that kind of doctor,

496
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:09,785
You call this patient's time of death,

497
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:12,496
and go to where doctors are needed
right now.

498
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,748
Go to those patients who can be saved.

499
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:16,959
Can't you hear them crying out for help?

500
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:44,236
Please, Lee Chi-hoon.

501
00:47:58,792 --> 00:47:59,918
Time of death...

502
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,882
Uruk local time...

503
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:11,722
3:40 p.m.

504
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:37,080
Let's work.

505
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:53,764
MORGUE

506
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:59,811
Kang Mo-yeon,
you're all right, aren't you?

507
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:02,773
Hurry up and call me. Please.

508
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:08,737
I bought the wine.
Hurry back and drink it with me.

509
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:21,500
Now that I've been given permission
to pursue my medical profession,

510
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:23,543
I solemnly take an oath to spend

511
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:26,880
the rest of my life volunteering to
save people's lives.

512
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:29,091
Medical team! Medical team!

513
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:32,344
Doctor, it's an emergency!

514
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:37,349
First and foremost, I will think
about my patients' health and lives.

515
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:43,730
Regardless of race, religion, nationality,

516
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:46,817
or social status,

517
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:50,654
I'll fulfill my obligations
to my patients.

518
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:55,826
One, two! Up!

519
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:57,869
One, two!

520
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:01,123
Even if I am threatened,

521
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:06,044
I will not misuse my knowledge.

522
00:50:16,304 --> 00:50:18,598
It's a relief you weren't hurt badly.

523
00:50:28,316 --> 00:50:30,819
What's wrong? Does it hurt somewhere?

524
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:46,334
This oath I take,

525
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:50,881
of my own volition,

526
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:54,176
I devote my honor to it.

527
00:51:05,353 --> 00:51:07,773
Is he a survivor?
Shall I wake up the medical team?

528
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:26,625
DEATH TOLL 14

529
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:21,364
Attention!

530
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:25,493
Salute to the commander!

531
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:27,287
Solidarity!

532
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:30,165
Solidarity.

533
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,263
You all have worked so hard.

534
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:49,017
-Is anyone hurt?
-No, sir!

535
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:51,811
That's good.

536
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:54,856
We'll skip the report.
I heard it on the way here.

537
00:53:56,483 --> 00:54:00,612
We will start a full-scale
rescue operation inside the power plant.

538
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:04,783
-Is anyone opting out of this?
-No, sir!

539
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:07,827
Good.

540
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:12,624
There is one rule with this mission.

541
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:15,669
Do not get hurt.

542
00:54:16,711 --> 00:54:21,383
If we get hurt, those who need
us will lose their lives too.

543
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:24,886
-Understood?
-Understood, sir!

544
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:28,265
You're dismissed.
You may all go back to your positions.

545
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:29,808
To our positions!

546
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:59,254
I am glad that you are safe.
I was very worried about you.

547
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:02,424
Well then.

548
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:05,510
Master Sergeant Seo!

549
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:15,854
Please don't get hurt. This is an order.

550
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:20,900
Don't get injured under any circumstances.
Do you understand me?

551
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:47,862
I was hoping you weren't hurt.

552
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:55,412
This whole time, I regretted...

553
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:58,623
leaving without seeing you that morning.

554
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:02,544
I can't always stay by your side.

555
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:04,671
So please...

556
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:08,633
take care of yourself.

557
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:10,844
You too, Captain.

558
00:58:35,428 --> 00:58:38,389
You should let him know first.
He will be worried.

559
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:42,644
How about you? If I wasn't safe,
how would you have felt?

560
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:46,314
It means he is willingly going to walk
into that pile of concrete.

561
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:48,566
He is asking for to die.

562
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:51,152
-I'm going in. Give me some water.
-Let's go together.

563
00:58:52,153 --> 00:58:54,864
It's the aftershock! Get out!

564
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,242
What's this noise?
Check the power plant!

565
00:58:57,951 --> 00:58:59,285
Control Center!

566
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:01,412
Hello? Hello!

567
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:03,331
Get them out now!

568
00:59:03,414 --> 00:59:05,667
The structure has gotten weaker.
If it collapses again...

569
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:08,920
It's useless to say
it's dangerous, isn't it?

570
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:12,590
Hurry up! It's collapsing! Help me!

571
00:59:13,466 --> 00:59:14,676
We lost him.

572
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:16,052
Is there anyone out there?

573
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:18,763
There's a dead person here!

574
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:22,892
