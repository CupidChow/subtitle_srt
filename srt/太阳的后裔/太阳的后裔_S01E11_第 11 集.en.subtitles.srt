1
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:31,072
They really are blood diamonds after all.

2
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:34,868
I suppose those are real diamonds, right?

3
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:37,287
I wonder how much they're worth.

4
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,789
We're the only ones who know
how many there are.

5
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:43,418
-Should we each take one?
-I didn't see you as that kind of person.

6
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:45,378
You are quite wise.

7
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:54,471
But what if we really caught the disease?

8
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:56,014
Are you scared? 

9
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,476
Aren't you?

10
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:04,856
Didn't I tell you
what I am most scared of?

11
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:08,777
But more than what he does,

12
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,945
I'm more afraid
of being separated from him.

13
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:14,407
That's why I am not afraid,
because we're under the same sky.

14
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:35,845
Are you crazy?

15
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:39,265
Hurry up and leave!
I'm in isolation right now--

16
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:52,987
I guess it's me.

17
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,331
This is a little scary.

18
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:15,927
Sir, please take this person and get out.

19
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:18,638
I won't go.

20
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:22,433
I will stay here.

21
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:25,979
I will stay here with you.

22
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,285
Since I'm a confirmed case,

23
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,872
and you've had contact,
we need to be isolated separately.

24
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,547
As a doctor, this is my diagnosis.

25
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,342
It is an order as a soldier.

26
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:00,597
Please get out.

27
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:17,655
What will happen to Myeong-ju?

28
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,658
I heard that the fatality rate
is over 50 percent.

29
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:25,830
I heard it's no better than Ebola.
Is that true?

30
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:27,624
Yes, that's correct.

31
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,835
Will she live... or die?

32
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,880
There is no 100 percent in medicine.

33
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:38,468
But in the case of a young
and healthy patient like First Lt. Yoon,

34
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,679
the probability of death
decreases drastically.

35
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:43,890
Because her immune system is good.

36
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:48,603
Thank you.

37
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,855
A cytokine storm?

38
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:54,984
Isn't it good if she is young and healthy,
because her immune system is good?

39
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,195
That's the irony.

40
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,782
There can be problems
because her immune system is good.

41
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,158
Then what should we do?

42
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,078
Aren't there any methods to treat this?

43
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,456
I will put up a fight
and try every method possible.

44
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,335
I will do my best and will not lose.

45
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:16,547
Because fighting against viruses
is war for doctors.

46
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,135
It's reassuring knowing that
her fellow soldier is dependable.

47
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,850
We have a confirmed case
of an M3-type virus.

48
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:33,147
I am designating the Medi Cube as the
base medical facility for treatment.

49
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:36,943
Use the Intensive Care Unit as
a quarantine facility for confirmed cases.

50
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:41,781
Under medical supervision, if we follow
the quarantine and hygiene rules,

51
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:43,533
we can stop it spreading further.

52
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:47,370
-While we shouldn't be careless...
-...there's no need to be too scared.

53
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:51,332
This is a hospital and there are patients
that we need to treat.

54
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,293
We must perform our duty...

55
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,628
as best as we know how.

56
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:03,094
EPISODE 11

57
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,475
What will you do with your laptop?

58
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:12,186
I'm going to be bored,
so I'll play some games.

59
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,399
I'm going to use up
all the items that I have collected.

60
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:17,775
Who cares at this point?

61
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,945
It's 38.7 degrees.
The fever is not going down.

62
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,614
This will sting.

63
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:28,578
You were always good
at drawing blood first time.

64
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,288
Not in the beginning.

65
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:35,626
It was after messing up a
medical student's arm when I was training.

66
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,878
I guess you remember.

67
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:41,424
I'm thankful for that
every time I draw blood.

68
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:44,010
Apply pressure.

69
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,972
Why are you so gentle?

70
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,932
Is it because you think I might die?

71
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,435
Did I get a positive result?

72
00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:00,109
The way I see it, you just have a cold.
It's an overreaction due to the situation.

73
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:02,820
Call if you are in pain.

74
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:07,658
What if I want to see you?

75
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:13,915
I will come back before that happens.

76
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,433
You must be bored to death in there!

77
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:39,690
I'm sorry.

78
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:42,652
If you are sorry, just come out safely.

79
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,821
It's okay if you cause an accident.

80
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,781
Just come out healthy.

81
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:52,912
How is Myeong-ju now? Is she okay?

82
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:55,164
She is not a patient yet.
She is still a doctor.

83
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,668
She is busy checking up
on Chief Manager Jin and on herself.

84
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,464
How are you doing?

85
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:08,344
Please tell her that I am okay
and not to worry about me.

86
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:09,929
It's channel three.

87
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,229
Go ahead and chat.

88
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,525
I am paying you back
for Dr. Kang's visit last time.

89
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:25,862
Thank you.

90
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:27,530
I'm leaving.

91
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:41,836
Yoon Myeong-ju here.

92
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,047
Sergeant Seo Dae-yeong,
if you hear this, answer.

93
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:54,807
Roger.

94
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,019
Oh, it's Seo Dae-yeong.

95
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:01,063
How are you feeling?

96
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,154
I miss you.

97
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,242
Did you eat?

98
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:15,870
I miss you.

99
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,127
How are you feeling?

100
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,136
Idiot. I already let you know the answer.

101
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:37,266
I miss you.

102
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:52,156
Did you eat?

103
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,785
I miss you.

104
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:04,835
I know.

105
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:09,632
Are you crying?

106
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,306
By any chance, do you remember...

107
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,351
the white dress that I wore

108
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,687
when we met for the second time?

109
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:27,441
You asked me then if the look
I was going for was a virgin ghost.

110
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:32,071
Thinking about that now,

111
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,532
I'm wondering if that was foreshadowing.

112
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:37,577
If I die now,
I really will be a virgin ghost.

113
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,370
I feel like it's very unfair.

114
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:43,791
You are an angel.

115
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:52,967
Yoon Myeong-ju was an angel
since the moment she came into my life.

116
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:56,637
Please know that.

117
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:06,480
You're so sweet now that I'm sick,

118
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,778
But whether it's a virgin ghost
or an angel,

119
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,239
they are both dead.

120
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:45,728
Until the test results come back,
we're going to quarantine the Medi Cube.

121
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:49,940
We're treating the general outpatients
at the temporary clinic.

122
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:53,527
When will the preventative vaccine
I requested arrive?

123
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:58,240
I made an emergency request last night
so it should get there by tomorrow.

124
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:01,786
What's the whereabouts of patient zero
and those he came in contact with?

125
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:05,998
We got hold of the list of people he
came in contact with from his route.

126
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,208
We sent them to the U.N.

127
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,251
requesting isolation
and further diagnosis.

128
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:12,588
-Here's the report and the list of names.
-That's fine. Talk from there.

129
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,423
Do not cross the table line in front.

130
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,261
How is First Lieutenant Yoon's condition?

131
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,013
-She still seems okay.
-Is she?

132
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:25,017
Okay. Then transfer her to the
American hospital quickly.

133
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:28,729
I sent the U.S. military hospital
a request, so send her quickly.

134
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:32,650
The Medi Cube is the U.N. designated
base medical facility for the M3 virus.

135
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,736
-We cannot transfer the patient.
-You think I don't know that?

136
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,824
Hey! Just feign ignorance
and send her, before things get worse.

137
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,867
This is from the
Infectious Diseases Manual.

138
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,328
It's so close to your transfer,
do you not want to go home?

139
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,833
If the situation doesn't end,
will you live here?

140
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,877
It's a fight against an invisible
infectious disease.

141
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,171
It's an enemy we've not fought,
a real battle.

142
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:58,718
If we don't abide by the rules,
no one will be safe.

143
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:02,388
Why is this punk just mimicking
the Field Manual?

144
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,433
I understand, so do it.

145
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:10,438
Do it, but if any one of you gets sick,
then I can't go home either.

146
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,107
No one gets sick. Got it?

147
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:16,444
Yes, I understand. Solidarity.

148
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:22,950
The epidemic disease, M3, found at Mowuru
the site of a recent huge earthquake,

149
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:26,787
is found to have infected two Koreans.

150
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:30,583
It's been confirmed that a man and a woman
are infected.

151
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,918
-I will call Kang Mo-yeon.
-I'll call Dr. Song.

152
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,087
Why isn't she picking up?

153
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,465
Song's phone is off completely.

154
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:38,883
Hello?

155
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:40,176
Lee Chi-hoon picked up?

156
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:45,306
Mother-in-law, it's me.
Did you see the news?

157
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:49,935
They say it's an
infectious disease this time.

158
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:55,274
Why are they creating heartache for a
a month instead of coming back home?

159
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:58,527
Is your heart dying now?
Mine's already dead.

160
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,280
-You're here?
-Yeah, I'm here.

161
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:03,908
Because you didn't visit, I came.

162
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:07,745
Is now the time for you
to give an elegant speech from your desk?

163
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:09,413
Why aren't you running to Uruk?

164
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:12,792
Why would I go there when there is havoc
because of the epidemic?

165
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,211
"Why would you go there?"
Do you hear yourself?

166
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:18,255
How can you call yourself
this hospital's chairman?

167
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,467
Where on earth did you send my Chi-hoon?

168
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:25,346
Bring my Chi-hoon to me within 24 hours!

169
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,681
Auntie, wait a minute. Please let go.

170
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,725
What are you doing? Stop her.

171
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:30,851
That...

172
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:34,188
You dare order around my precious
daughter-in-law who's almost due?

173
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,899
In my heart, I feel like a widow now.

174
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:41,070
You hear that? Take this hospital
off the lease right now!

175
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:44,490
I am done with your mom as well.
I won't be her friend any more.

176
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:46,534
Auntie, wait a minute.

177
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:50,329
I'll tell him to come. I'll make him come.
I'll make sure he comes.

178
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:55,084
If I can make him come tomorrow,
you would feel much better, right?

179
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,837
Tomorrow, okay? No?

180
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:01,090
Doctor Pyo, it's me. Do me a favor.

181
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:05,344
There were some journals
that hadn't been uploaded to the internet.

182
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:07,429
It's too much to scan,

183
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,765
so I'm just going to take pictures
and send them.

184
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,293
What is all of this?

185
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:41,797
Wow, do doctors study
even when they are sick?

186
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,216
Don't soldiers go to war
even when they are sick?

187
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,260
Ah, yes. That's right.

188
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:51,682
Are you hungry by any chance?
Should I bring some more snacks?

189
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:55,019
No. I am curious about this disease.
That's why I am eating.

190
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,813
This work requires a lot of stamina.

191
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,985
If I were in the military,
this would be war.

192
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:06,322
This was good.

193
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:09,283
Thank you. Please succeed.

194
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:11,035
Solidarity.

195
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,597
Will he live?

196
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:38,228
Fortunately, he regained consciousness,
but his breathing is quite unstable.

197
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,564
The next few days will be critical.

198
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:45,027
Diamonds came out from his belly.
This much.

199
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,739
That's right. What I saw was right.

200
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:52,034
How much is this worth?

201
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:58,040
Two carats each, 30 fine diamonds...
About two billion won?

202
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:01,543
Two... two billion?

203
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:10,094
No wonder people risk their lives
when it's two billion.

204
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:26,110
Long time, no see.

205
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,280
I waited for you because you went
to headquarters.

206
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,616
When will the test results come in?

207
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:36,286
They said by tomorrow afternoon.

208
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,622
They'll send it via fax ASAP.

209
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:41,208
That's faster than I thought.
That's a relief.

210
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,710
Yeah.

211
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:50,676
Speaking of blood tests,
what is your blood type?

212
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,804
Your ideal type.

213
00:16:58,726 --> 00:16:59,601
More.

214
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:02,312
Pretty type?

215
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:05,524
One more time.

216
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:07,401
Doll type?

217
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,324
I lost. I lost!

218
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:16,452
I tried.

219
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,787
What you did for me when I was
having a hard time,

220
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:21,123
I did for you as well.

221
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,669
Please don't worry.

222
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:29,506
Then beat it, so that I can stop worrying.

223
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:33,635
I want to hold your hands and hug you.
It's hard to endure.

224
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:37,431
Really, that's how you handle it?

225
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:39,349
It was a joke to reassure you.

226
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:44,354
As if. I'm going. Off to do my best.

227
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,234
So what's your blood type?

228
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:52,029
"A lifetime sentence with you"?

229
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,158
Leave. Go do your best. Quickly.

230
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:59,244
-I have better ones.
-Go. Go inside.

231
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:11,173
Respiration and body temperature
are all normal.

232
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:15,094
She said, "It is all better now.
You'll go to a safe place tomorrow.

233
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:18,472
There is a virus here."

234
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:22,810
It's happening again.

235
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,646
Lieutenant Yoon here.
The quarantine section lost power.

236
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:27,314
Is the generator not working?

237
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,942
I think it's the line, not the generator.

238
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,443
We'll check it out now.

239
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,654
The dining hall is also--

240
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:38,575
Manager Jin's respiratory machine...
Please look after the situation here!

241
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,334
What's wrong?

242
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:04,184
-A sedative, please!
-Got it.

243
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,483
What's going on?

244
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:17,406
-I'm coming in!
-Don't! There's a risk of infection!

245
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:21,201
We'll handle this.

246
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,871
Just please hurry
and get the power back on!

247
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,748
Ten minutes. It'll be done in ten minutes.

248
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,125
Okay!

249
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:50,314
Stethoscope. Please, the stethoscope.

250
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:54,943
Are you alright?

251
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:00,490
His heartbeat is weak.
Bbring the Ambu bag, hurry!

252
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:06,788
One, two, three. One, two, three.

253
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,917
You've been bitten!
This is not the time to be doing this.

254
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,923
What happened? Are you okay?

255
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:18,425
Both of you, please don't talk to me.
This is tiring.

256
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:23,013
I'll hold it. How long has it been?

257
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,766
Two minutes.
Doctor Lee Chi-hoon was bitten.

258
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,143
-Lee Chi-hoon.
-Later.

259
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:32,564
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

260
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:05,889
Since you have an injury, you know the
risk of infection is higher, right?

261
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:08,433
Yes.

262
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,104
If it weren't for you,

263
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:15,274
you know that the patient
would've died, right?

264
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,074
You've become a doctor, Lee Chi-hoon.

265
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:26,952
I'll draw blood.

266
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:32,124
We've finished cleaning. We'll get going.

267
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,583
Thank you.

268
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:48,807
Is that person...
going to contract the virus now?

269
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:54,396
We have to hope that is not the case.
But for now, he needs to be quarantined.

270
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:59,067
Doctor Chi-hoon,
you were a hero earlier.

271
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,197
You seemed a bit like a doctor then.

272
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,034
Let's go.

273
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:25,052
Why are you crying? Does it hurt?

274
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,971
Did you get hurt somewhere else?

275
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:29,931
No.

276
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:33,226
Because I'm okay.

277
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:39,274
Because now I'm okay.

278
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:44,196
Because I can go back to Korea now.

279
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,783
What are you talking about?

280
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:49,868
What's wrong?

281
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:57,876
Quarantined? Why?

282
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:01,838
Did you contract the M3 virus?

283
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:05,384
I might have contracted it...
but I don't know yet.

284
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:09,554
I probably got quarantined
to become a doctor.

285
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:14,267
Contacting me after a month,
what kind of news is that, you fool?

286
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,895
Do you know how worried I was?

287
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:21,066
I thought I was getting a divorce
while in my third trimester, you fool.

288
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:25,112
That isn't too bad because...

289
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:28,323
if you receive my death settlement,
you'll become rich.

290
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:29,950
Hey!

291
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:34,496
I love you, Jang Hui-eun.

292
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:37,958
I really, really love you, Hui-eun.

293
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,585
It really is Lee Chi-hoon.

294
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:44,756
You came back.

295
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:03,859
Central Tower said the medication is
on it's way. Should be three hours.

296
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:06,445
Please take good care of it.
The kids as well.

297
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,451
Doctor!

298
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:14,369
The fax!

299
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,830
The test results are back.
Everyone tested negative.

300
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,039
Really?

301
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,752
That's fortunate.
Does Captain Yoo know this too?

302
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:24,838
Captain Yoo gave me that fax.

303
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:26,840
He went to release
Sergeant First Class Seo.

304
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:37,684
She disciplined the soldiers
and ate as much as she could.

305
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:39,519
She fell asleep a while ago.

306
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:41,104
I knew she'd be negative.

307
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:44,191
In rare cases,

308
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:48,612
even if infected, they say
that you can still be asymptomatic.

309
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,114
She's a rare woman,

310
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,909
I hope it's not the case this time.

311
00:24:57,871 --> 00:25:00,165
Did you hear?

312
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:02,751
What are you talking about?

313
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:05,045
Because of my quick response,

314
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:08,215
they say that there aren't any
secondary victims in the city.

315
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:10,425
Well, after the vaccinations are complete,

316
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:14,304
the alert level will also be lowered
from "Caution" to "Attention."

317
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:17,390
A message from the U.N....

318
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:21,436
to the Mowuru company commander,
that's me by the way,

319
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:27,192
saying that they wanted to
express their gratitude.

320
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:32,614
Did you hear me?

321
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,159
What did you say?

322
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:41,540
Because of my quick response--

323
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:45,168
Snoopy transmitting.
Situation in the cafeteria.

324
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,212
Situation in the cafeteria.

325
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:49,506
Alpha Team's aid needed.

326
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,582
Did he come to test for the M3 virus?

327
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:23,767
Be quiet...

328
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:01,823
It's antibodies.

329
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,778
He found out about
the U.S. military's plans.

330
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,571
And our strategy.

331
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,325
Strengthen the security
around the barracks.

332
00:29:57,295 --> 00:30:00,423
That person was the one
who tried to do something bad to her...

333
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:03,510
Please take care of Dr. Song.

334
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:05,845
I will stay with her for a little while.

335
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:08,556
The results for the M3 are back.

336
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:13,144
What is Doctor Song's result?

337
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:25,990
The test results are back.

338
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:29,702
Really? So then I'm officially free
from quarantine.

339
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:32,956
Let's go.

340
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:35,542
Go where? You haven't even
heard the results.

341
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:37,877
High fever, headache, chest pain
and coughing.

342
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:41,172
The early symptoms of an M3 virus
are similar to Ebola,

343
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:44,592
but your skin is still like white jade,
and you still look pretty,

344
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,469
so I have no problems with my vision.

345
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:50,890
My symptoms are viral.
Have you ever had them?

346
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:51,933
It's just a cold.

347
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:59,732
Yeah, you child. You had a common cold.

348
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:00,942
I was worried!

349
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:39,981
What is this? Aren't you gonna let me go?

350
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,774
You hugged me first.

351
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:44,986
And I realized my mistake. Let go.

352
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:48,781
Catch my cold,
catch my cold, catch my cold.

353
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,158
You're such a schoolboy!

354
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:57,582
Confirm this first.

355
00:31:57,665 --> 00:32:01,294
In the time we've been together,
I've contemplated this the most and...

356
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:03,463
I think I found the answer.

357
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:13,181
What is this?

358
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:21,898
Cefotaxime?

359
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:26,361
It's a live cure.
Where is Team Leader Kang?

360
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:34,077
In 2007 and 2011!

361
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,205
If you look at the medical reports
of the doctors in Western Africa,

362
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:40,166
an average of 85 percent of patients
had positive results.

363
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:43,753
That's 53 out of 63 people
and 73 out of 85 people!

364
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:46,172
How did you find this?

365
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:49,133
This is very different from the
regular use of Cefotaxime.

366
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:51,511
After analyzing the DNA shape
of the M3 virus,

367
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:56,683
and the chemical molecular weight
of the antibiotics repeatedly...

368
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:58,977
-Really?
-I'm kidding.

369
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:03,898
I just went through all the M3 reports
by each year, one by one calmly.

370
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:06,651
I respect you, Dr. Song.

371
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:08,361
Let's try this.

372
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:12,949
But it isn't among the drugs we brought--

373
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:15,368
Then contact Daniel and--

374
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:17,120
-I did.
-Already?

375
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:20,581
It will come along with
the preventive vaccine. I'll be going now.

376
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:25,920
Did you guys fight?

377
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,381
In specialized terms,
it's called push-and-pull.

378
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:31,551
Seriously, Doctor.
Do you know how worried she was?

379
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:53,740
Solidarity.

380
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:57,994
Dad...

381
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:01,456
I am sick.

382
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,835
Did you not receive the report?

383
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:08,504
I did.

384
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,967
But you didn't even call.

385
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:16,929
They say the chance of surviving
is fifty-fifty,

386
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,725
but there is nothing I can do as a father,

387
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,603
and there is nothing I can order
as a commander.

388
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,900
There is nothing I can do.

389
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:34,030
That's why I waited
for my daughter's call...

390
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:37,742
powerlessly.

391
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:43,706
I won't lose. I will get through this.

392
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:45,291
Don't worry, Dad.

393
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,252
Alright. Of course.

394
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:52,256
I hope that you will do that for me.

395
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:56,135
But please listen to two of my requests.

396
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:01,933
You have two requests?

397
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:06,312
The first one is...

398
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,567
please forgive me, Dad.

399
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,531
Before I came here,

400
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:22,620
I threatened that you would lose both

401
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:26,124
First Lieutenant Yoon Myeong-ju
and your daughter.

402
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:33,214
I am sorry, Dad.

403
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:41,681
Alright. Just get better.

404
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:46,811
What is the second one?

405
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,066
When I get better,

406
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:55,111
if I really don't die,

407
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:00,825
don't take away
Dae-yeong's military uniform.

408
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:06,164
Please don't do that, Dad.

409
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:13,796
I heard everything.

410
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:17,925
Yoon Myeong-ju, leave.

411
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:27,977
I don't want a Sergeant first class
as my son-in-law.

412
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:30,188
So instead, step down from your post.

413
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:35,276
I, Sergeant First Class Seo Dae-yeong,
can officially date Yoon Myeong-ju.

414
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,277
Solidarity.

415
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,404
He really gave you permission?

416
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:40,239
Yes, he did.

417
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:45,161
But I liked being together so much,

418
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:47,830
I pretended not to know.

419
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:52,501
I am sorry, Dad.

420
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,090
You worry about me,

421
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,220
but I worry about him.

422
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:08,267
This is more like my daughter.

423
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,938
You have to make me worry like this
to be my daughter.

424
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:23,324
I'll call again, Dad.

425
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,826
It's time to get injections.

426
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:28,329
I'm hanging up.

427
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,174
Yoon Myeong-ju!

428
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:02,196
-Her temperature is 41 degrees.
-Fever reducers aren't working.

429
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:05,616
-The worst has started.
-Immune overreaction?

430
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,202
Yes, a cytokine storm.
Please administer steroids.

431
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,454
Fill the tub with ice.

432
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:19,714
We have to lower her temperature
before organ failure starts.

433
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:25,928
For now, we can only respond
to the current symptoms.

434
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:29,682
Essentially, we can only hope the cure
Doctor Song came up with will work.

435
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:31,392
Is that medicine still not here?

436
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:34,979
It's supposed to come with the preventive
vaccine so it should arrive--

437
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:36,314
It's Daniel.

438
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,107
Yes, are you here?

439
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,985
Excuse me? What do you mean?

440
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:49,660
The truck that was carrying the vaccine
has been stolen.

441
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:53,914
The medication needed to treat
First Lieutenant Yoon were in there too.

442
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,291
That bastard!

443
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:58,461
If we don't get it in an hour,
it will be too late.

444
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:01,630
If we request it from the CT hospital,
it'll take at least 4 hours.

445
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:03,132
Is there any other way?

446
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:06,385
-We get the bastards who took them.
-Unsecured communication. I was--

447
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:32,953
I think I know where
Myeong-ju's medicine is.

448
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:48,928
This is Snoopy transmitting.
We've secured everybody's position.

449
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:39,979
Yes.

450
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:50,197
Stop right there, you bastard!

451
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:04,170
If it hurts, just yell. It's okay.

452
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:08,048
I'm okay. I can take it.

453
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:11,177
Hang in there.
The medicine will be here soon.

454
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:15,389
-Doctor Kang.
-It must be here. Stay with her.

455
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,070
Official duty.

456
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:34,533
This girl you are taking care of
is under arrest

457
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:37,369
for dealing stolen medicine
in the black market.

458
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:40,623
The accomplice had already confessed.

459
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,939
Even if you had given it to her,

460
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:08,734
she is still under arrest
for dealing in the black market.

461
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:12,696
Were you that foreign doctor
who was at the scene?

462
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:18,994
I don't understand how there is no
cure when medicine has improved so much.

463
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:22,331
Because it doesn't sell.
If it doesn't sell, there is no profit.

464
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:24,124
They won't make it for no profit.

465
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:27,503
They won't make it because there is
no money when someone is dying?

466
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:31,173
That's why people like us
do what we're told not to

467
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:33,968
and go where we're told not to go.

468
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:36,595
In order to change the world.

469
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:41,225
I hope that Ms. Army Surgeon
will get better after taking the medicine.

470
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:44,603
This herb controls fever.
Let's infuse it well,

471
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,439
so that I can work my magic.

472
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:55,447
Will those herbs really help?

473
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,700
We are just doing everything we can.

474
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:02,162
Whether it is western medicine,
eastern medicine, or praying.

475
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:07,459
Medical team.
Gather in front of the Medi Cube.

476
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:09,378
The medicine has arrived. Over.

477
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:10,671
Alright. Over.

478
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:11,797
-Let's go.
-Okay.

479
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:16,135
-Oh, you are here.
-Good job.

480
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:17,177
Here.

481
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:18,637
Thank you.

482
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:19,823
It's 37.5 degrees.

483
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:43,222
Where is Doctor Kang?

484
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:44,890
I don't see her.

485
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:47,017
That's right.

486
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:50,312
Yesterday, the police came
and said they were arresting Fatima,

487
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:52,439
so she went to the police station
with her.

488
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,441
What did you just say?

489
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:57,528
Are you sure it was the Uruk police?

490
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:16,268
I will make sure you die.

491
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:18,687
I swear on my honor,

492
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:23,483
I will kill you with my own hands.

493
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:23,752
Big Boss transmitting.

494
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,592
Doctor Kang,
listen carefully to what I say.

495
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:35,055
I will definitely find you,
and I will definitely save you.

496
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:42,604
You know I am a man who does his job well,
right?

497
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:47,442
I'll come quickly, so don't be afraid,
don't cry,

498
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:51,697
wait for just a little while.

499
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:54,700
I'll be there shortly.

500
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:10,007
And I look forward
to seeing you, Big Boss.

501
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:52,674
You crazy bastard!

502
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,053
Snap out of it!

503
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:59,723
Rescuing a hostage?
Are you part of the Alpha team?

504
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:02,350
You are nothing
but a mere dispatch soldier now.

505
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:05,228
You are a military soldier
who is here to rebuild peace!

506
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:08,940
I have to leave, sir. I will go, sir.

507
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:10,567
You are not going anywhere!

508
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:13,945
I must go, sir. I will be back, sir.

509
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:17,866
Hey, kid. Can't you see this?

510
00:51:18,116 --> 00:51:20,994
Didn't you see
that this has been blinking?

511
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:24,414
Line 2 is the Chief Commander,
Line 3 is the Blue House. What can you do?

512
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:36,593
Solidarity. Taebaek military base,
Lieutenant Colonel--

513
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:39,763
This is Blue House Chief of Security.
I'll get straight to the point.

514
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:41,723
Has there been a hostage situation?

515
00:51:45,143 --> 00:51:47,854
It wasn't quite a hostage situation.
It was similar but--

516
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:48,814
It's true.

517
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:51,024
Are you sure?

518
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:53,777
The story I heard from the CIA
was a bit different.

519
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:57,197
It is a hostage situation, sir!
The culprit is...

520
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:00,951
The culprits were 14 or 15 armed--

521
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:03,912
I don't need a report,
I'll get briefed by the U.S. military.

522
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:05,997
I contacted you because I have a request.

523
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:10,460
Until we get the situation under control,
keep this top secret.

524
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:12,963
-Please, all of you, be on stand by.
-Yes, sir.

525
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:14,965
We don't have time to wait around.

526
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:22,305
According to SOP in emergency situations,
I will begin the hostage rescue mission.

527
00:52:22,764 --> 00:52:24,015
Do what now?

528
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:27,435
No, sir. That is all for now.

529
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:29,396
Look here, Captain Yoo!

530
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:32,274
First the Arab VIP and now this?

531
00:52:32,357 --> 00:52:34,734
I've been cutting you a lot of slack here.

532
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:37,154
Is the Blue House Chief a joke to you?

533
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:40,782
Do you think this is why this country
equipped you with weapons?

534
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:44,369
This is not about a life and death
situation for one individual!

535
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:46,538
This is a problem on a national level!

536
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:56,882
If this nation doesn't take notice
one persons death, then that's a problem.

537
00:52:57,382 --> 00:53:01,928
I don't know where your homeland is,
but I will protect mine, sir.

538
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:07,392
You crazy little--

539
00:53:09,477 --> 00:53:12,105
Stop right there!
If anyone is there, stop him!

540
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:17,319
Hold it right there, sir!
He is telling you to be on stand by.

541
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,364
Is that gate sturdy?

542
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:25,827
I've wrecked a few gates
and that doesn't look so sturdy.

543
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,792
-If you do this, you'll be in trouble.
-Move or get hurt.

544
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:35,545
I'm driving straight through it.

545
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:37,797
Commander, sir!

546
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:44,512
He wants you on the phone, sir.
It's the chief commander, sir.

547
00:53:50,101 --> 00:53:52,896
-Solidarity. This is Captain Yoo Si-jin.
-Three hours.

548
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:56,858
For three hours,
I will not know your whereabouts.

549
00:53:57,651 --> 00:54:00,654
For those three hours,
you are not a part of the Alpha Team,

550
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:03,114
nor company commander
of the Taebaek military base.

551
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:06,701
You are also not a captain of the Republic
of Korea's army. Do you object?

552
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:09,287
-No, sir.
-That is all for now.

553
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:11,081
Solidarity.

554
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:26,680
How is First Lieutenant Yoon doing?

555
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:28,807
She's unconscious,
but her fever is going down.

556
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:31,393
I think the medicine is working.

557
00:54:31,476 --> 00:54:32,519
That's a relief.

558
00:54:33,561 --> 00:54:35,730
I'll be going out for a bit.

559
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:40,151
I won't be able to see you
before I leave.

560
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:42,487
I'm sorry about that.

561
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:46,074
You mean you are going somewhere?
What--

562
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:50,662
Myeong-ju is awake now,
I'll call you back.

563
00:54:51,496 --> 00:54:53,540
Myeong-ju. Excuse me!

564
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:42,339
I don't know why you brought me here,

565
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:45,342
but you can forget about
getting anything out of me.

566
00:55:45,925 --> 00:55:47,927
I've got nothing to lose.

567
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:30,989
You're supposed to say that
while handing over envelopes of cash,

568
00:57:31,072 --> 00:57:32,949
and casually drinking a glass of water.

569
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,785
Why tell me to break up with him
without an offer?

570
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:39,956
I know you're curious
about what I'm saying, right?

571
00:57:40,915 --> 00:57:44,169
Well, none of your business,
you piece of trash!

572
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:52,260
Big Boss, please answer.

573
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:54,596
Big Boss! Big Boss, please answer!

574
00:58:03,062 --> 00:58:04,898
-Solidarity.
-When did he leave?

575
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:07,275
He passed through the guardhouse
earlier.

576
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:08,943
What about Dr. Kang?

577
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:13,948
She went to the local police station
last night and she hasn't returned yet.

578
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:19,204
Is there something going on, sir?

579
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:23,833
Something bad.

580
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:03,808
