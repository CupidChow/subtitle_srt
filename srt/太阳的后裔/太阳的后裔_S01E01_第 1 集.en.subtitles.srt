1
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:57,640
680 M SOUTH OF THE DEMILITARIZED ZONE

2
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:02,270
At around 1:20 a.m., three North Korean
special armed  forces...

3
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:03,480
MILITARY COMMAND CENTER

4
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:06,357
crossed the Military Demarcation Line,

5
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:08,526
broke into our guard post at the border,

6
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,988
and took hostage of two of our soldiers
who were on guard duty.

7
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:15,325
They are continuing
their sit-in even as we speak.

8
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:17,494
Sit-in?

9
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:21,790
So they've sent three special forces
operatives to start a war?

10
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,502
It is meant to provoke us.

11
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,170
In the Demilitarized Zone,

12
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:30,632
whoever shoots first is the one violating
the armistice agreement.

13
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:35,720
Their goal is to provoke our military
to use force first,

14
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,390
so they have an edge in negotiating
at the six-party talks.

15
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,897
So what are we supposed to do?

16
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,858
We can't just fall for it and attack.

17
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:54,280
Nor can we just sit and watch
while our soldiers are held hostage.

18
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:56,324
We'll send them back quietly.

19
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:00,912
We've dispatched
the Special Forces Alpha team.

20
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:12,215
Stop. Move and we shoot.

21
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:16,928
I'm Captain Yoo Si-jin
of the Alpha Team.

22
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:20,723
From here on out,
our Alpha team will take over.

23
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:40,535
What are you doing?

24
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:43,872
It's the Demilitarized Zone,
so we'll resolve this with a dialogue.

25
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,265
This is the operation commander.

26
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:05,935
Are our soldiers inside okay?

27
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:11,232
Let's stop this now. We'll send you home.

28
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,276
Doesn't seem like they'll go quietly.

29
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:14,819
Let's go inside.

30
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,074
Big Boss transmitting.

31
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,826
I'm going in with Wolf.

32
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,121
Piccolo transmitting.

33
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:27,040
Position secured.

34
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,132
Snoopy transmitting. Explosives in place.

35
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:38,176
Operation on standby with Harry Potter.

36
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,178
We're using explosives?

37
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:41,846
Then what do we do about those two?

38
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,682
It's our last resort in case
the negotiation fails.

39
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:49,812
Open the door.

40
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,231
Stop this and just go.

41
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:55,193
It'll only get more complicated
come morning.

42
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,362
Leave while we still let you.

43
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:36,818
Not so fast.

44
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,996
As a warrior of the Republic,
we can't leave without a good go

45
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:50,373
at some South Korean special forces

46
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:57,880
Fine.

47
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:00,758
Let's do this.

48
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,376
You naturally hold the knife
with your right hand, don't you?

49
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:53,681
Comrade, you won't be able to kill me.

50
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:58,186
South Korea cares so much
about the many eyes watching

51
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,188
that you can't shoot first.

52
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:04,984
We, the Republic, are different.

53
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,532
Seventy years since the division,
yet we still have our misunderstandings.

54
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,993
If it's to protect the peace,

55
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,205
we will shoot precisely,
whenever, wherever.

56
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:27,256
Let's not make any more mistakes.

57
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:30,384
I don't interfere
when an enemy makes a mistake.

58
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:34,430
I can't come as a warrior
and leave as a casualty.

59
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:38,184
Put it down.

60
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,397
It was nice meeting you,

61
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:44,941
Captain Yoo Si-jin.

62
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,234
Likewise.

63
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:50,988
But let's not make this an annual event,
Senior Lieutenant An Jeong-jun.

64
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:05,419
Let's go.

65
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,010
Big Boss transmitting.

66
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,639
Alpha team has resolved the situation.

67
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:31,821
EPISODE 1

68
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,384
Did you shoot with your eyes closed?

69
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:54,719
Your rank is Private...

70
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:57,638
Doesn't this gun's barrel look like it's
a bit twisted?

71
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,849
I can't adjust the clicker or the sight. 

72
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:01,976
It's rubbish.

73
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:03,978
One more round?

74
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:05,229
This...

75
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,231
Can't I adjust the clicker?

76
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,232
Hey!

77
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,068
You can't just mess with it so carelessly!

78
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,779
This is the same model
the American Delta Force team used

79
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:14,989
in the desert war.

80
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:17,700
If you treat it
like the ones you used in the military

81
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,869
it's going to break.

82
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,246
This isn't the same model.

83
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,249
Thief! It's a thief! Hey!

84
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:30,004
Hey! Catch that thief!
He's a thief. Catch him!

85
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,672
He's coming this way.

86
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,091
I'll borrow this real quick.

87
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,429
But we're on our break!

88
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:44,810
It's a toy gun, so we have a short range.
About five meters.

89
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,687
He's about 10 meters away.

90
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,359
Seven meters.

91
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,695
Guys, that’s dangerous!

92
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:55,738
Five meters.

93
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:01,410
Now.

94
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,191
The motorcycle is fine.

95
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:33,984
Did you call the police?

96
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:34,902
It's fine.

97
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:38,698
Calling the police over a coupon thief
is more bother than it's worth.

98
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:41,992
Anyway, his injury has
nothing to do with me,

99
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,327
so don't get me involved.

100
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,286
Okay?

101
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:56,090
Hello, we have a victim
of a motorcycle accident here.

102
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,386
It's okay. It doesn't hurt.

103
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,098
Lie down.

104
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:07,768
One wrong move and you could be stuck
with a lifelong spinal injury.

105
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,106
What are you doing now?

106
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,693
Providing first aid
after an act of social justice.

107
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,366
Let me buy two
of those stuffed animals.

108
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,203
Those aren't for sale.

109
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,455
Just sell them to me.

110
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,125
Or else I'll win them all.

111
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:37,006
Oh, and lend me a marker
if you have one.

112
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:39,592
A marker?

113
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,986
Your girlfriend is super pretty.

114
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:00,780
I think she's the one.

115
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,240
Yours fits you very well, too.

116
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,077
This one's a fellow soldier.

117
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:08,871
Why...

118
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,000
Why would you accept these?

119
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:16,587
He looked so sincere when he asked us
never to return. How could I not?

120
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,800
How can you be so tough in war
with such a soft heart?

121
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,844
Just when you think you know someone...

122
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,807
That kid from earlier...
I wonder if he'll be okay.

123
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,894
He knew how to do a side break fall
when falling from the motorcycle.

124
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,688
He looked like an athlete. He'll be fine.

125
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,025
I was that age once, too.

126
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:41,862
Good teammates are crucial for athletes.

127
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:43,197
Why?

128
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,573
Does it bother you?

129
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:47,284
Because it reminds
you of your dark past?

130
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:49,411
I do feel bad for him.

131
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:55,251
When you were that age,
did you do a lot of bad things?

132
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,002
I was the one who gave the orders.

133
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,880
You make yourself out to be
a film noir character,

134
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,174
but that "poor kid" is a criminal.

135
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,384
You're cruel.

136
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:06,971
Look at you.

137
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,602
Is it the unit?

138
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:14,937
It is a unit...

139
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:18,232
but not ours.

140
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:19,191
YOON MYEONG-JU

141
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,193
-Don't pick up.
-I'm going to pick up.

142
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,612
I'm going to pick up
and call her here,

143
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:25,906
so meet her
and take care of it like a man!

144
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,241
I'll buy you dinner.

145
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:29,869
Nah, I make enough to buy my own dinner.

146
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,579
Whiskey, 17 years.

147
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:34,290
If it's 17 years old, it's still a minor!

148
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,250
A date with my cousin, works with planes.

149
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,251
Air Force?

150
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:38,419
Flight attendant.

151
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:40,588
Pics of her colleagues
on her social media.

152
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:44,258
So you've been hiding this desirable
family member all this time?

153
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,260
Give me your phone already.

154
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:48,929
Hurry, hurry.

155
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,480
Are you playing me?

156
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:02,735
Why are you only looking at places
where there aren't any pockets?

157
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:04,528
Earlier...

158
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:11,660
Are you okay?

159
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,998
Excuse me.

160
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,083
Is this the patient?

161
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:21,003
Yes, we did emergency first aid, but...

162
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,632
You're saying you got pick-pocketed?

163
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:27,217
-I'm gonna get this kid...
-You said you felt bad.

164
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,136
Where did they say the hospital was?

165
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,517
What's happening?

166
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:39,647
Take these off, I look ridiculous.

167
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,483
Don't move.
We'll move him inside like this.

168
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,818
Excuse me, sir.

169
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:47,488
Really, nothing hurts.

170
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,073
Excuse me.

171
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:51,367
It's the patient's.

172
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,368
Oh, okay.

173
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:53,744
Thank you.

174
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,165
YOON MYEONG-JU

175
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:00,167
Hello?

176
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:03,504
No, this is the Haesung Hospital
emergency room.

177
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:06,590
The phone owner was brought in
for a motorcycle accident.

178
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:08,592
Are you the guardian?

179
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:16,976
This is the patient.

180
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:19,770
There's a chart here.

181
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,524
Who wrote this?

182
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,734
The ones who made me like this.

183
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,779
Please take this off of me, seriously.

184
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:30,531
I will, so don't move.

185
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:32,116
Please change this to one of ours.

186
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,075
Yes.

187
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,704
Whoever did the first aid
did an extremely good job.

188
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:37,746
Cute and sturdy.

189
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:40,040
Let's see.

190
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,875
Suspected rib fracture...

191
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,169
Yup, that's a rib fracture.

192
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,671
Your ankle...

193
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:49,133
Right, an ankle sprain.

194
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,553
-Are you a thief?
-What?

195
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,388
It says so right here.

196
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,098
"Thief."

197
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,475
"Treat as painfully as possible."

198
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:02,146
What are you saying? I'm the victim.

199
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:04,356
Talk to your insurance company.

200
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:08,068
We'll have to take an X-ray to examine
your ribs and your ankle.

201
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,195
Doctor Kang, the chief is calling.

202
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,489
Oh, right.
Let me know when you get the X-ray.

203
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,079
Here's your phone.

204
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,749
Your guardian called, so I answered.

205
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:24,710
You have to wait a while for the X-ray,
so stay here for now.

206
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:41,769
I got totally screwed over.

207
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:45,522
I got shot while getting away.

208
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:47,983
That's not all.

209
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,443
It's a long story.

210
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:51,904
For now...

211
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,114
Get over here with the motorcycle.

212
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:59,244
I finished organizing
the research for your paper.

213
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:00,954
Great work.

214
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,957
Was it of any help to your studies?

215
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,794
Yes, it helped a lot with my studies.

216
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,672
You did a good job
organizing the charts too.

217
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:14,843
All that's left is the interview
for the professor position, right?

218
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,387
Yes, I've been preparing...

219
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,227
well.

220
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,816
Oh, sorry.
A patient is running away...

221
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:32,402
Someone's running away without paying
for their treatment?

222
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,863
He hasn't received treatment yet.
If you're done--

223
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,616
Okay, go catch him quickly.
He should be treated.

224
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,827
Medicine is a benevolent art, after all.

225
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,370
Well then, I'll get going.

226
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,624
Nurse Choi.

227
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,126
Yes?

228
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,794
Where did this patient go?

229
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:52,089
He was here just a moment ago.

230
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:56,468
I said I really have to go.

231
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:59,847
If I stay, I'll only make more noise
for the entire hospital.

232
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:01,056
He ran away?

233
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:02,850
You didn't see that?

234
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:04,852
I'm sorry.

235
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:07,521
He crossed the parking lot.
Look, his ankle's swollen.

236
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,190
Ugh, this is so frustrating.

237
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:12,818
If I get caught by my big brothers,

238
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:15,863
I won't be lying in the emergency room,
I'll be in the mortuary.

239
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,700
What right does the hospital have
to hold me here?

240
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:22,077
Isn't it up to the customer to decide?

241
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:25,455
It's not by right,
but by obligation, customer.

242
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,040
If you're going to go,

243
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:30,419
sign a treatment waiver
and pay at the desk before you leave.

244
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:31,336
Excuse me?

245
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:33,630
Why would I pay?

246
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,591
I didn't have anything done here.

247
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:38,719
You met with a doctor.
You need to pay the consultation fee.

248
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:40,804
-And if I refuse?
-We'll call the police.

249
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,518
These people, really...

250
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:49,938
Fine!
My friend is supposed to come anyway,

251
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,899
so I can lie down until he gets here.

252
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:54,943
The bed is the other way, customer.

253
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:57,571
I'm going to the bathroom.

254
00:19:58,113 --> 00:19:59,489
You expect us to believe that?

255
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:00,908
I won't run away, okay?

256
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,118
I'll leave my cell phone.

257
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:06,705
I'll burn this place down. Let go!

258
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:10,125
Ugh, such shitty luck.

259
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,921
Wow, that little punk.

260
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,092
Big Boss?

261
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:21,178
Are you kidding?

262
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:24,640
All these kids need to go to the military
so they can learn a lesson.

263
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,808
-Let's get back to work.
-Okay.

264
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,022
He's not picking up.

265
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,114
If I catch him, he's dead.

266
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:44,660
Is that why you are scoping out
the location of the funeral hall first?

267
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,454
Ah, what a meticulous person.

268
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:51,792
Emergency room's this way.

269
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:52,918
I'm coming.

270
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,009
I came out. Where are you?

271
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:04,972
Are you here?

272
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:28,578
This will sting.

273
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,957
I am going to suture,
so please prepare a 3-0 nylon.

274
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,083
Okay.

275
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,004
Excuse me.

276
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:39,840
Hello?

277
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:45,721
Hello?

278
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,476
BIG BOSS

279
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:55,939
Mr. Big Boss?

280
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:57,858
Ah, yes.

281
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,902
But why do you have that phone?

282
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:03,363
The patient left his phone with me.

283
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:05,407
Are you his guardian?

284
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:08,285
I'm not,
but I'm the guardian of the phone--

285
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:11,079
No feeling, right? We'll stitch it up.

286
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:16,460
Where did the motorcycle patient go?

287
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:18,962
Oh! Why isn't he there?

288
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,423
Did he go to the X-ray room?

289
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:28,513
Who am I speaking with right now?

290
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:32,642
Are you the big brothers
who wanted to send him to the mortuary?

291
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,061
The mortuary?

292
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,939
There's a misunderstanding--

293
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:41,151
Nurse Choi,
tell these men to go wait outside.

294
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:44,738
Tell the security team to make sure
they aren't causing trouble.

295
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:48,992
Now.

296
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,661
You can't be here.
Please go wait over there.

297
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,413
-Wait.
-Hurry.

298
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,066
Seeing as he left the phone,
it looks like he ran away.

299
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:25,320
Yes, it does seem he ran away.

300
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,239
Let's go look for him outside.

301
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:29,199
He couldn't have gone far.

302
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:31,743
Yes, he probably didn't go far.

303
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,788
You should go.

304
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,509
Ow, my stomach!

305
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:50,679
My stomach...
I think it's my appendix.

306
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:53,765
-The appendix isn't there.
-Ah, it's over here.

307
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,100
Man, what's going on?

308
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:57,018
You were right before. It's the other side.

309
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:05,360
Wow, this kid.

310
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:07,988
Let's go.

311
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:11,867
They look like gangsters.

312
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:14,119
The boss and his right-hand man.

313
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:17,497
Did I push them too hard?

314
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:21,626
Don't worry.
I'm better with a knife than they are.

315
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,550
Do we know where we're going?

316
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,135
I have a place in mind.

317
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:33,013
Earlier, there were guys
that looked like gangsters.

318
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,488
Do you have to get your phone back?

319
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:52,240
They look like they're good at fighting.

320
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,201
There's a reason I need to get it back.

321
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:55,702
What's that?

322
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:59,581
Is there something
you don't want others to see?

323
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:02,209
Not very honorable.

324
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:03,460
But something good?

325
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:04,377
Yes.

326
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:08,507
Hey, you guys over there!

327
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:11,593
Everyone, stop what you are doing!

328
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:14,095
Who are you guys?

329
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,264
Just keep walking.

330
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:18,975
Don't interfere with a funeral.

331
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,146
We have some business with him.

332
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,356
Then get in line.

333
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:26,566
You fucking passerby.

334
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:31,571
Please save me this once.

335
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:36,409
Hey, did you steal their phones too?

336
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:41,164
What's the reason?
Why are you getting beaten up?

337
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,958
Please save me this once...

338
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,752
I'll return the phone I stole right away.

339
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:49,756
Hey, look at how many of them there are.

340
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:52,968
You think this is fair?

341
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:57,514
Gi-beom said he wanted to leave the gang
and they asked for a withdrawal fee.

342
00:25:58,598 --> 00:25:59,641
Five million won.

343
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,352
Withdrawal fee? Wait.

344
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:05,355
Is this normal for these gangster dudes?

345
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:07,774
Steep inflation since my days.

346
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:10,694
So you're one of us?

347
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:13,238
He's got nothing to cough up, anyway.

348
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,448
How about you and I settle this?

349
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:17,534
That's a good idea. Settle it with me.

350
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:20,620
If money is the issue,
let's settle it with money.

351
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:23,290
I have a lot of money.

352
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:26,710
Whoever has the guts can take this.
It's all yours then.

353
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:29,212
-Really?
-Seriously?

354
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:30,463
Please stay out of this.

355
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:32,340
I mean it.

356
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:34,467
I'm his brother.

357
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:37,637
What's your name, again?

358
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:39,806
Gi-beom. Kim Gi-beom.

359
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,642
I am Gi-beom's brother.

360
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:46,229
If you can take this wallet,
I'll give you the withdrawal fee.

361
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:47,147
Try and take it.

362
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:53,278
You're dead if it's empty.

363
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:16,843
Wow, you even carry around knives?

364
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:23,516
This won't do.
There's nothing good about this gang.

365
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,226
Let's break it up.

366
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:29,105
If you've got knives, drop them.

367
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:31,024
If you've got guns, drop them.

368
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:32,400
All at once.

369
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:35,487
Hey, we outnumber them.
We have a shot.

370
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,781
Take out all your knives.

371
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,122
Why did you have to say that?

372
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,834
I'm regretting it now.

373
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:53,004
At least there aren't any guns.

374
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,547
Everyone, attack!

375
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:01,638
Will you take a look here?

376
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:04,182
There seems to be
an issue with the lung.

377
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,896
That motorcycle patient...

378
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:11,981
I think he ran away again.

379
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:15,860
But his guardian is here.

380
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:16,820
Again?

381
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:18,571
Where is his guardian?

382
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:34,337
Yoon Myeong-ju?

383
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:39,592
Senior Kang Mo-yeon?

384
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:43,847
Are you this patient's guardian?

385
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,181
Are you his doctor?

386
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,225
Where is the patient?

387
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:49,185
Let me see the chart first.

388
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,814
Why?
This isn't your hospital or your patient.

389
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:57,527
We always seem to meet
when there's a man between us.

390
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,154
I don't have time for jokes.

391
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,822
Just give me the chart, please.

392
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:02,866
He's important to me.

393
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:05,785
Important?

394
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:06,995
Is he badly hurt?

395
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:10,457
How do you not know
where your patient is?

396
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:12,459
Where did the patient go?

397
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,003
Precisely my question.

398
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:19,048
It seems this important person
of yours ran away without paying.

399
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:22,677
So why don't you pay his bills
while you are here?

400
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:26,973
Call security and tell them to search
the men's room.

401
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:30,143
Even if you don't find him,
get the payment from his guardian here.

402
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:31,978
You just leave like that?

403
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,691
Talk to Nurse Choi over here.

404
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,236
We've kept an unwilling patient
twice already.

405
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,905
I think we've done our part.

406
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:43,490
I'm busy, bye.

407
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,162
Where's the men's room?

408
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:50,747
There.

409
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:52,791
Guess what?

410
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:55,210
Yoon Myeong-ju's in the ER.

411
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:57,712
Yoon Myeong-ju?
The one from the military academy?

412
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:00,006
Yeah, the military bitch
who interned with us

413
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:01,674
for outsourced training or whatever!

414
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:06,179
Yeah, that pretty medical officer
who stole your crush.

415
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,891
Hey, who are you calling pretty?

416
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:12,560
Big eyes? Nice nose?
That's what makes you pretty?

417
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:14,312
That's what makes a pretty face?

418
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:16,105
Plus, it's all makeup.

419
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:18,024
-She's pretty without it too.
-Without--

420
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:22,529
And she never went out with him.

421
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:26,032
All past emotions aside,
why's she in the ER? Is she hurt?

422
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:29,035
No, her boyfriend was hurt.

423
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:33,122
But no matter how you look at it,
the boyfriend was at most 20 years old.

424
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,040
Is she crazy?

425
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:36,543
What are you talking about?
Her boyfriend's a soldier.

426
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,546
What soldier? He's got long hair.

427
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:40,797
He is a soldier.

428
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,133
Their story's famous among her colleagues.

429
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,718
Her boyfriend is a noncom.

430
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:47,011
A noncom?

431
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:48,555
What's that?

432
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:53,351
Military ranks like Sergeant,
Staff Sergeant, First Sergeant, you idiot.

433
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,062
Isn't it more weird
that you would know that?

434
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:59,649
Anyway, her boyfriend is a First Sergeant
and took the GED.

435
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:03,403
But she's an academy officer,
a medical officer at that

436
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:05,321
and her dad is a three-star general.

437
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:06,739
That can't be smooth sailing.

438
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:08,741
Really?

439
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:14,247
Then, who's the one
who left his phone and ran?

440
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,464
What happened to him?

441
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:26,050
Nurse Choi!
Call Doctor Kang, now!

442
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,596
There was a little accident.

443
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,189
What happened?

444
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,110
I heard you were hurt, but you look fine.

445
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:46,905
Follow me.

446
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:58,958
What happened to him?

447
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:00,627
Something came up.

448
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:02,795
An unfortunate accident nearby.

449
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,797
This isn't an accident. It's an assault.

450
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,675
You two adults did this to a kid?

451
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:09,302
What the...

452
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:13,181
Patient, who did this to you?
Did he do this to you?

453
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:14,807
No.

454
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:16,809
He saved me.

455
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:20,355
Patient, this is the hospital,
so it's okay.

456
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:23,900
We have security,
so you can tell the truth.

457
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,818
Did this person hit you?

458
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:29,072
Ugh, I already told you he didn't hit me.

459
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:37,038
You won't believe it
no matter what he says, will you?

460
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:46,339
I'll give you painkillers
and we'll take some X-rays.

461
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:48,800
Nurse Ha, after his dressing--

462
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:51,302
Don't worry.
I'll take him there myself.

463
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:55,056
Nurse Choi, call security.
I'm gonna go and check the CCTV.

464
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,641
And I'll call the police.

465
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:01,229
Hey, wait a minute.

466
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,482
Hey, wait a minute!

467
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:09,112
Get out.

468
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:11,239
I will,
once we clear up this misunderstanding.

469
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:16,369
Everything that kid said is true.
That kid--

470
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:18,079
Is that patient your kid?

471
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:31,634
Your patient stole my colleague's phone,
so we came to find his phone.

472
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:35,263
Then we saw him getting beat up,
so we saved him.

473
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:37,598
You saved the thief
that stole your phone?

474
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:41,728
It'd make more sense
to have beaten him to death.

475
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:47,900
Yes, is this 112?
This is Haesung Hospital's Emergency--

476
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,710
EMERGENCY

477
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:08,921
What are you doing?

478
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:10,715
I'll be straight forward with you.

479
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:13,092
Calling the police is problematic.

480
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,094
Is it?

481
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:17,513
Give me the phone.

482
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:22,268
To be honest, we're soldiers.

483
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:24,145
We're soldiers on leave.

484
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:27,690
If we are entangled in an assault case,
it becomes a bit of a bother.

485
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:29,609
We'd have to write reports and all that.

486
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:31,903
I ask for your cooperation.

487
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:33,946
Why should I cooperate with you?

488
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:36,908
What do I care
if you're a soldier or a thug?

489
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:38,785
Give the phone back.

490
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:47,293
Every male in the Republic of Korea
has this, so this isn't convincing.

491
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:50,463
This...

492
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:54,050
If you say this is forged,
there's nothing I can say.

493
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:56,594
Where did you go to school?

494
00:34:57,512 --> 00:35:00,139
This is Haesung Hospital,
are you from Myeongin University?

495
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:01,808
Why do you ask?

496
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:04,894
Do you know Yoon Myeong-ju?
You should be from similar years.

497
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:09,565
How do you know her?

498
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,694
Are you by chance...

499
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:17,490
First Sergeant, Staff Sergeant,
Sergeant...

500
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,117
There was something else...

501
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,661
-Sheriff.
-Ah, yes, Sheriff.

502
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,330
Are you that person?

503
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,086
I'm not that person, but come with me.

504
00:35:31,754 --> 00:35:33,422
Someone will confirm my identity.

505
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:41,597
It's been a very long time.

506
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,641
Yes, ma'am.

507
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,812
It must've been quite an effort
trying to avoid me,

508
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:49,772
yet you're looking good.

509
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:51,524
Yes, ma'am.

510
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:55,111
When will we be able to speak
without ranks and honorifics?

511
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:59,407
Or would you just ignore me completely
if we removed the ranks?

512
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:00,658
Yes, ma'am.

513
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:04,412
I'm really gonna kill you.
How long are you gonna avoid me?

514
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:07,081
Why won't you answer my calls?

515
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:10,835
You wouldn't even let me confirm
if you were alive.

516
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,589
How long will you continue to run away?

517
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,009
Answer me!

518
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:20,887
I'm not asking you because I don't know.

519
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:23,472
Just...

520
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:27,476
at least let me hear you say it.

521
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,856
It's not because of what you think.

522
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:37,111
I hope you won't assume
I left because of you, ma'am.

523
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:40,323
I had a change of heart.

524
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,869
I can't put that any other way.

525
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:48,289
That's all.

526
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:52,001
-I don't believe you.
-If you're done--

527
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,337
-Don't be like this.
-I'll be going.

528
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:57,924
Don't you dare.

529
00:36:58,257 --> 00:36:59,175
Stop.

530
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:01,135
Seo Dae-yeong, stop.

531
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:03,846
Sergeant Seo Dae-yeong.

532
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:07,099
How dare you leave
without saluting to your superior?

533
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:35,920
Stand as you are.

534
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,464
Stand there all night.

535
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:40,967
Stand there until you die.

536
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,304
I’m never going to accept your salute.

537
00:37:58,234 --> 00:37:59,151
You...

538
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:01,904
This is considered hazing.

539
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:03,990
I'm training a cowardly soldier.

540
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:06,450
What do you need?

541
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:09,954
I'm a dishonored soldier
in need of vindication.

542
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:14,834
Can you verify our identity
to this person here?

543
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:16,335
She's not gonna believe me.

544
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:20,464
An acquaintance is more convincing
than a stranger, so tell me.

545
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:22,675
Is that right?

546
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:27,388
Then, report these two people
to the police.

547
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:30,016
They're runaway soldiers.

548
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,270
Hey, you troublemaker!

549
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:38,024
I wish you'd return my cellphone.

550
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:39,734
Your identity has been confirmed.

551
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:41,527
Please return it to him.

552
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:48,200
With the way things have unfolded,
I'll have to look at this phone later.

553
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:53,372
No more misunderstandings then?

554
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:56,542
Your identity's been confirmed.
The assault is something else.

555
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:57,626
Follow me.

556
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:06,218
It'll take about five minutes to find it.
Please wait here.

557
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:07,261
Yes.

558
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:38,084
How do you know Myeong-ju?

559
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,796
I'm her senior from military academy.

560
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:46,717
You confirmed our identity.
Did you have to ask for more?

561
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:49,720
I already look like a terrible liar.

562
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,640
Murderers generally look approachable.

563
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:58,437
That does seem true.

564
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:02,650
Don't give me a straight face now.

565
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,610
That scares me. It's just us two here.

566
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:05,820
Don't worry.

567
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:10,282
It's my principle to always protect
beauties, elders, and children.

568
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:13,285
That's a relief,
since I fit into one of those three.

569
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:14,662
No, you don't.

570
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:16,539
As an elder!

571
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,048
So, Mr. Big Boss...

572
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:28,426
what's your name?

573
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:30,302
Yoo Si-jin.

574
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:31,971
And you?

575
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:34,557
Kang Mo-yeon.

576
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:38,978
Nice to meet you.

577
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:41,647
Don't act friendly.

578
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,632
I think you just made eye contact with me.

579
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:13,179
What sport did you do?

580
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,892
I did judo
until my second year of high school.

581
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:22,146
Why were you just getting hit earlier?

582
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,399
To get it over with quicker.

583
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:32,156
How did you know
I trained in something anyway?

584
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:34,950
By the way you were getting hit.

585
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,536
You learn how to get hit
before you learn how to hit.

586
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:40,873
I did Taekwondo.

587
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:45,711
-Elementary, middle, and high school.
-Were you good at it?

588
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:49,173
I earned a gold medal,

589
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:51,717
and...

590
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:54,428
Patient Kim Gi-beom,
is your guardian here yet?

591
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:57,890
-We need to admit you as an inpatient.
-I don't have one.

592
00:41:58,766 --> 00:41:59,892
He has a guardian.

593
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:07,900
Oh, my gosh!

594
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:14,073
Oh, gosh!

595
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,793
That's right, just like that!

596
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:29,880
Yes!

597
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:34,677
That's good! Yes!

598
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:48,357
That's it!

599
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:53,612
We confirmed the situation.

600
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:55,698
I'm sorry for the misunderstanding.

601
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,242
If you're sorry,

602
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:00,703
can you treat where I really am hurt?

603
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:02,955
Where are you hurt?

604
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:05,583
Here.

605
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:08,711
Here?

606
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:13,007
You exaggerate too much.

607
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,217
I'm not exaggerating.

608
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:32,401
It looks like your stitches opened up
from fighting earlier.

609
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:33,819
When did you get hurt?

610
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:38,157
A few days ago.

611
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:39,825
How did it happen?

612
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:43,329
While I was shoveling with my unit.

613
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:45,831
A soldier's best friend, a shovel.

614
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:47,833
Is that right?

615
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:51,795
What a strange unit...
getting shot while shoveling.

616
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:54,048
This is a gunshot wound.

617
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:58,510
You've seen a gunshot wound before?

618
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:00,179
Of course not in Korea,

619
00:44:00,262 --> 00:44:02,389
but I seen them
when I volunteered in Africa.

620
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:09,438
I'll say this since you already know

621
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:11,231
but this is actually...

622
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:13,359
a wound I got in Normandy.

623
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:18,405
The bullets were
pouring down like rain then.

624
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:21,825
I went through the bullets
to save my fellow soldier.

625
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:22,868
Yes, I did.

626
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:25,663
Was that soldier's name...

627
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:27,414
Private Ryan?

628
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:37,007
The suture is done.

629
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:39,885
The stitches can be removed after a week,

630
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:42,638
but you'll need to keep
the area sanitized until then.

631
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:45,432
-There's a hospital in the army, right?
-Can I come here?

632
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:48,435
-Isn't this far?
-It is.

633
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:50,979
Can I come every day?

634
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:53,732
Every day is too often.
Maybe three times a week?

635
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:56,360
Come four times a week
and you might get better quickly.

636
00:44:57,444 --> 00:44:59,071
Are you agreeing to be my doctor?

637
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:02,116
You're just sanitizing a wound.
Is it important who the doctor is?

638
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:04,201
It's important.

639
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:08,664
Most of all,
the beauty of the doctor concerned.

640
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:15,129
In that case,
you won't find anyone better.

641
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:17,840
I'll make you an appointment.
Come at 2 p.m..

642
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:27,224
As a doctor, you must not have
a boyfriend, since you're busy.

643
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:33,522
As a soldier, you must not have
a girlfriend, since it's so tough.

644
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:37,651
Who answers the question?

645
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:06,680
Is this one better or this one?

646
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:09,391
Try the right one again.

647
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:12,144
Where are you going looking so pretty?

648
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:14,688
Haesung Hospital
the day after tomorrow.

649
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:17,232
-About my wound.
-The medical corp is right here,

650
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:19,610
but he'll travel hours
just to get a wound cleaned.

651
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:22,654
Physical strength is national strength.

652
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:25,282
To have a strong body and heart
to defend the Motherland,

653
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:27,493
I need to receive my treatment
at Haesung Hospital.

654
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:30,120
It has the best facility
and team in Korea.

655
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:32,748
The doctor is pretty.

656
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:36,460
No pretty doctors at the medical corp.

657
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,419
Yes, there are.

658
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:40,672
Oh, I know her too!
First lieutenant Yoon Myeong-ju, right?

659
00:46:41,423 --> 00:46:43,675
Wow, she is gorgeous.

660
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:46,345
She got dumped pretty bad
by the guy that she was dating.

661
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:50,015
Whoever that bastard is,
I want to see his face.

662
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,353
Why are you guys doing this?

663
00:46:54,436 --> 00:46:58,816
Hey, why trade your life
to satisfy your curiosity?

664
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:02,778
Did I trade something?

665
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:07,282
I am going to Haesung Hospital
the day after tomorrow, too.

666
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:08,575
Please give me a ride.

667
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:10,786
Why are you going?

668
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:16,291
The hospitalization fees are settled.

669
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:19,461
It's not like a soldier gets
paid that well.

670
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:23,382
Take care of your body.

671
00:47:23,465 --> 00:47:26,635
If you're going to do something bad,
don't do it in front of me.

672
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:30,597
I'm off for my treatment.

673
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:39,231
Be sure to take your medicine regularly,
and eat before you take it.

674
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:42,067
I'm grateful that you paid for me,

675
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:44,152
but I can't pay you back.

676
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:47,906
And don’t use this as an excuse to preach
some lesson either.

677
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:48,866
I don't plan to.

678
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:51,827
Go. I'm going.

679
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:54,246
Excuse me.

680
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:03,005
I'm sorry for stealing your phone.

681
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:05,173
Okay, I got it.

682
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,385
Excuse me.

683
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:15,475
Getting beat up doesn't work,
and giving them money doesn't either.

684
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:20,772
So how did you get out?

685
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:27,779
I escaped to a place
they could never follow.

686
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:30,449
Where is that?

687
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:41,543
Please get out of the way!

688
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:44,338
Nurse Ha, we probably need more blood.

689
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:45,797
I'll prepare five more.

690
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:49,176
Please move!

691
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:52,971
What are you doing? Speed up!

692
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:09,529
OPERATING ROOM

693
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:26,588
CURRENT TIME 12:27
SURGEON KANG MO-YEON

694
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:51,530
CURRENT TIME 18:04

695
00:50:27,941 --> 00:50:28,942
Hello?

696
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:30,193
Yoo Si-jin?

697
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:32,946
It's Kang Mo-yeon.

698
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:35,657
You finished the surgery?

699
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:39,036
Yes, I heard you came and left?

700
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:41,872
This is my first time
being blown off by a doctor.

701
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:45,709
There was an urgent operation.

702
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:48,879
-Did she survive?
-What?

703
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:50,839
The patient who had the operation.

704
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:54,301
Yes, we saved her.

705
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:56,762
You're amazing.

706
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:00,307
Is this your personal number?

707
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:02,684
Yes.

708
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:05,187
So you've got my number.

709
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:07,022
Save my number, too.

710
00:51:09,816 --> 00:51:11,568
I want to see you tomorrow for sure.

711
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:15,238
Are you normally so straightforward?

712
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:18,158
I meant I really want to get
treatment tomorrow.

713
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:19,534
Of course.

714
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:21,536
That's what I meant, too.

715
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:22,662
I don't think so...

716
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:25,707
It’s not good to not trust your physician.

717
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:28,335
Did you take your medication?

718
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:32,047
If I don't take my medicine,
will it get worse?

719
00:51:32,547 --> 00:51:34,424
Could I be hospitalized or something?

720
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:37,886
What time is good for you tomorrow?

721
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:42,015
Actually,

722
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:44,101
do you want to meet now?

723
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:52,734
Is that a no?

724
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:57,405
It's not. Please come.

725
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:53,879
AFGHANISTAN:
TWO U.N. EMPLOYEES KIDNAPPED

726
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:04,890
Solidarity!

727
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:07,809
Current location is Gangnam, Seoul.
Haesung Hospital.

728
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:09,561
Yes, I'll be waiting.

729
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:11,521
Yes, I understand.

730
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:18,236
Are you here?

731
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:22,157
Yes, but something came up,
so I'm on my way back.

732
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,036
You're leaving?
Where are you right now?

733
00:53:26,411 --> 00:53:27,245
The rooftop.

734
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:30,665
The rooftop? Which rooftop?

735
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:38,048
What are you doing here?

736
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:41,593
I'm sorry.

737
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:43,887
But I have to blow you off this time.

738
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:51,895
It must be an emergency.
You should go to downstairs--

739
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:52,812
No.

740
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:55,357
It's here for me.

741
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,399
You?

742
00:53:57,108 --> 00:53:58,026
Why?

743
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:00,570
Did a war break out?

744
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,117
Somewhere, yes.

745
00:54:06,868 --> 00:54:09,037
But it's not here, so don't worry.

746
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,414
Then what is a helicopter
coming to get you for?

747
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:15,335
I'll explain it later,
but make me a promise in the meantime.

748
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:32,811
Let's meet next weekend,
not at the hospital, but someplace else.

749
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:36,439
-Aren't you coming for treatment?
-I'll come back healthy.

750
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:39,359
Let's watch a movie together.

751
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:47,993
Hurry. I don't have much time.

752
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:50,787
Is that a yes or a no?

753
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:53,873
Yes, I'd like to.

754
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:56,584
That's a promise.

755
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:42,941
We have now reached the operation area.
We are now on a tactical flight.

756
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:52,117
-How far have we gone?
-We've been flying for seven hours.

757
00:56:54,327 --> 00:56:56,329
-Then the destination is...
-Yes.

758
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:11,261
-Harry Potter.
-Sergeant Gong Cheol-ho.

759
00:57:11,344 --> 00:57:13,513
The mosquitoes here are the worst.
Watch out.

760
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:15,014
Yes, sir.

761
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:20,311
But why are we taking off our ID tags?

762
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:22,856
In case we are killed,

763
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:24,983
we need to be unidentifiable.

764
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:02,312
Where are we right now?

765
00:58:05,857 --> 00:58:06,941
Afghanistan.

766
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:03,456
This isn't sparring. It's real.

767
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,124
He may die and he may kill.

768
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:06,376
Did you think of me?

769
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:09,003
Of course. How about you?

770
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:10,338
I did, a lot.

771
00:59:10,838 --> 00:59:13,132
I really didn't want to call, but...

772
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:15,426
Aren't you ashamed?
Aren't you embarrassed?

773
00:59:16,135 --> 00:59:17,845
We've decided to send the Alpha Team.

774
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:19,973
To where?

775
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:24,143
I am thinking of Professor Kang
as the volunteer team leader.

776
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:26,020
We found an explosive in zone B4.

777
00:59:26,437 --> 00:59:30,525
So you do things that can get you killed.

778
00:59:33,319 --> 00:59:35,321
