1
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:29,446
What a nice morning!

2
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:30,947
Good morning.

3
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:33,908
The distance between home
and work is too far.

4
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:36,953
I liked it when the Medi Cube
was right outside my dorm.

5
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,497
And we appreciated the "doves"
every morning.

6
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:40,790
Let's go in together!

7
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,375
Hello!

8
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:46,129
Doesn't today feel like
our first day of work?

9
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,756
I know, right? For me, too.

10
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:51,384
I feel the same too. Oh, it is cold!

11
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,595
Good morning.

12
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:56,806
We're really back.

13
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:01,853
Did you guys sleep well?

14
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:03,396
I dreamt I was in Uruk the whole night.

15
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,316
There was an earthquake
and an epidemic outbreak--

16
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:10,987
HAESUNG HOSPITAL'S
URUK MEDICAL VOLUNTEER TEAM

17
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,865
WE ARE PROUD OF YOU FOR
SHARING YOUR HEARTS AND TALENTS 

18
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:24,375
Chairman, you came all the way down here
to welcome us--

19
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:25,543
Nobody is sick, right?

20
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,587
Yes, we're okay.

21
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,382
You come over here.

22
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:35,887
He expressed an interest in Lee Chi-hoon
first, even though I greeted him.

23
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,724
Why didn't you come when you were told
instead of making us suffer.

24
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:43,478
Do you know how much your mother
came to the hospital every day...

25
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:45,980
and bothered me?

26
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,232
I wouldn't know.

27
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:52,695
Good work, everyone.

28
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:56,825
There will be a 100% bonus on top of
overtime pay for all the work you've done.

29
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,202
Everyone gets a comprehensive health exam.

30
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,913
At the personal request of his mother.

31
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:05,583
Let's get back to work, everyone.
You're dismissed!

32
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:10,296
Dismissed.  You guys are dismissed too.

33
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:26,187
Kang Mo-yeon gets a bouquet,
even though I greeted him...

34
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,355
You, really!

35
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:32,026
What could I do when you weren't
on the plane that I sent to get you?

36
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:36,156
After sending you off like that, do you
know how uncomfortable it was for me?

37
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,120
What is this?

38
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,622
Kang Mo-yeon!

39
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,169
I missed you so much!

40
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,884
At that moment,
what I saw was an explosion, a boom.

41
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,635
Everything falling down.

42
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,179
Everything was in ruins.

43
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:02,473
My heart started racing,
and my mind went blank.

44
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,936
-What is she saying?
-She is talking about the earthquake.

45
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,772
Earthquake?
Isn't that the moment you fell in love?

46
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:13,276
That's right. Did you spread the news
around the hospital that I'm dating?

47
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,820
By the time I arrived,
the news had already spread.

48
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:17,572
Then who?

49
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:19,574
What's the big deal? It's true anyway.

50
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,409
Just tell me about that man.

51
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:24,162
How is it dating
a soldier in the special forces?

52
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,749
What to do when your car
is hanging off of a cliff,

53
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,250
how to get out of a mine field,

54
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:32,253
the correct posture of a hostage
who is wearing a bomb vest…

55
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,047
these are the things you learn.

56
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:35,632
What is she saying?

57
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,051
It's hard for me to understand, too.

58
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:40,929
Even I didn't know
that this would come into my life.

59
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,353
Are you happy to be in Korea?

60
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:50,271
I'm still a bit out of it.

61
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:52,857
I miss Uruk.

62
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,278
There are no "doves" who sing
military songs in the morning here.

63
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,905
And you aren't here, either.

64
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:02,033
Is what you miss the "doves"
or the Captain?

65
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,912
The peace of Uruk.
That's what I'm talking about.

66
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:15,004
Are you busy climbing back up
to the position you were in before?

67
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,507
No, I'm going to resign.
I'll start my own business.

68
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,550
I even put in a deposit for a building.

69
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:22,345
What is a captain's salary?

70
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,472
If I go broke, can you feed me?

71
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:27,475
Hello?

72
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,185
Hello?

73
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:32,563
Ah, this is strange.
Why does it feel so far?

74
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,025
It seems our relationship became
just as far!

75
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,026
I'm hanging up!

76
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:42,031
If you go broke, I'll secure you
a position in the Alpha Team,

77
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,908
so don't you worry, Dr. Kang.

78
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,663
You have more field experience
than an active duty soldier.

79
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:53,042
Transmission received.
I won't go broke, don't worry.

80
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,503
I'm a girl who has even
crossed a mine field.

81
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:59,132
CHAIRMAN HAN SEOK-WON

82
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:01,134
-I have something to say.
-I'll go first.

83
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:02,802
-I'm sorry, but--
-On that day...

84
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:08,224
More specifically, that day in the hotel,
I was thoughtless.

85
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,438
I thought I was someone
who was entitled to do that,

86
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,816
but it didn't work on my Mo-yeon.

87
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:18,401
That really flustered me.

88
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:25,575
So are you saying I'm the first woman
who hit you?

89
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,911
Wow, you really are unbelievable.

90
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:31,289
Look here, Mr. Han Seok-won.

91
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,750
Mr. Han Seok-won?

92
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:37,462
Didn't I tell you that I would resign
as soon as I came back to Korea?

93
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:41,924
If I do this,
you are not a chairman any more.

94
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:48,097
I have no intention of letting you go,
so what shall we do?

95
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,641
You're resigning in a way, too, Chairman.

96
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,146
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

97
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:56,898
Do you have to go this far?

98
00:05:58,274 --> 00:05:59,817
How can a person be so harsh?

99
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,111
Are you doing this
because you're difficult?

100
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:05,114
Are you like this
because you have nothing better to do?

101
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:08,159
I request that you accept my resignation
by the end of the week.

102
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,414
Ah, that arrogance.

103
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,583
I love her so much!

104
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,086
But why? Why all of a sudden?

105
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:21,923
I was told that all I had to do
was sign to get the loan. So why?

106
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:23,716
I am sorry, ma'am.

107
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:28,221
The last time you asked about the loan,
you were a doctor at Haesung Hospital.

108
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:32,558
But now, you are just a licensed doctor
who wants to open a new office.

109
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:36,104
So, in reality, you are unemployed.

110
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,775
So what you are saying is that if I quit
my job at the hospital,

111
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:42,735
I can't get a loan?

112
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,530
That's correct, ma'am.

113
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,368
What should I do now?

114
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,287
Why are you asking me...

115
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,165
Next customer, please.

116
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,671
What do you want me to do?

117
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:04,132
I want you to live comfortably.

118
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:08,594
Just because you open a clinic
doesn't mean you'll live comfortably.

119
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,304
You know how many hospitals fail?

120
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:13,558
So you will continue to be
an army surgeon?

121
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:20,273
The surgery that soldiers need
is not complicated.

122
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:23,109
The most important thing
is giving an accurate diagnosis

123
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:25,945
in a contained environment
so the illness doesn't get worse.

124
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:32,452
A quick diagnosis as a doctor
and warm consideration as a soldier...

125
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,036
I'm very good at both of those.

126
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:37,248
I like the jobs
of both a doctor and of a soldier.

127
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:41,294
If a surgeon like me leaves the army,
it's a national loss.

128
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,213
-Don't you agree?
-I get it.

129
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:46,883
I stand corrected.

130
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:53,389
I'm sorry to interrupt your date,
but I have a message to deliver.

131
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,644
You always have a tendency
to do so during moments like this.

132
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,730
These days,
this is the most rewarding part of my job.

133
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:02,940
Take this.

134
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:06,444
It's a transfer order.

135
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:09,572
-For First Lieutenant Yoon?
-Yes.

136
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,284
She will be returning to Korea with you.

137
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:16,412
Really? What happened?

138
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:21,292
-Is this my father's doing?
-Why are you bringing up the Commander?

139
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,378
It is an order from
the Lieutenant Colonel and myself.

140
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:27,548
What connections do you have?
You can't even take care of yourself.

141
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,091
Oh, is that right?

142
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:35,431
Should I prove I have connections
by canceling this transfer order then?

143
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:40,061
My girlfriend has recently suffered from
an epidemic, so she can't think straight.

144
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:42,688
How did you do it anyway?

145
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:49,820
Even though she has recovered,
she will need stability and rest,

146
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,073
so I'm worried about her health here.

147
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:56,744
So, you think it's best to send
First Lieutenant. Yoon back to Korea?

148
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:02,333
Well, when she was sick
and on the brink of death,

149
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:07,421
you said to send her
to the U.S. Army hospital.

150
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,549
If she finds out about that,

151
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,302
wouldn't she feel disappointed?

152
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:18,683
Hey, Yoo Si-jin! Don't mince words.

153
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,478
Are you threatening me now?

154
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,606
If that was a threat just now...

155
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,067
it worked.

156
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,945
What do I do now?

157
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:34,073
If you consider a parent's heart--

158
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:37,243
Right? Even if he wanted to,
the Commander wouldn't be able

159
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:38,911
to ask her to come back home yet

160
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,788
because there are too many people
watching him.

161
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:42,748
I didn't even think about that,

162
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:45,084
but how thoughtful of you.

163
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:56,721
Do you miss me that much?

164
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:57,722
Save me!

165
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:01,726
Where are you? What happened?

166
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,395
They said I can't get a loan.

167
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:10,985
I threw a letter of resignation at
the Chairman and stormed off to the bank.

168
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,405
I can't get a loan. What do I do?

169
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:19,910
So you didn't consider going to the bank
prior to handing in your resignation?

170
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:21,370
What did you say?

171
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:25,333
"I turned in my resignation calmly,
but what if I'm not able to get a loan?"

172
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:30,046
Was it too much of a challenge
to think it through first?

173
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,589
Can't you request an extension?

174
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:34,383
Why come to Korea to see
such a short-sighted woman?

175
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:37,178
Don't come back.
Continue living there happily.

176
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:38,346
I'm hanging up!

177
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,183
What? Captain Yoo isn't coming?

178
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:43,267
What a shame!

179
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:47,688
Captain Yoo would be able to quickly go
and get the letter from his office.

180
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:49,649
Just go and plead.

181
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,693
How can I go and plead
after making such a scene?

182
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:58,908
There's a professor's position available.
Sweet.

183
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,369
-Will you continue appearing on TV?
-Seriously?

184
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,887
Is there something down here?

185
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:22,890
I wish there was.

186
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,481
-Should we laugh like it was a joke?
-No.

187
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:31,440
Okay.

188
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:36,487
I wonder if all of the Uruk team members
need to go through psychiatric tests.

189
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,490
Are you using the disasters
as an excuse for your abnormal mind?

190
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:41,701
This is not a laughing matter.

191
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:45,037
You won't be able to get one
now that you've resigned.

192
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:48,582
Just continue volunteering.
You can spend your life volunteering.

193
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,419
You were very beautiful and brilliant
while volunteering.

194
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:55,339
I've made a decision
after hearing your advice.

195
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,799
I'm leaving.

196
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,260
I'm such an influential person.

197
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:00,594
But where are you going?

198
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:06,517
I've considered my eight years
with Haesung Hospital.

199
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,562
From an internship to a professor,
Haesung has been my life

200
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:13,023
my reason for living, and a part of me.

201
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:15,818
Why are you being like this
President Kang?

202
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:18,738
You're so witty.

203
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,115
I guess the loan wasn't possible
without a job.

204
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,660
I'm sorry to disturb you, Chairman.

205
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:28,122
If you would give me another chance,
I'll give my all for the VIP ward--

206
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:31,500
Forget about the VIP ward
and go work in the ER starting today.

207
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,671
Did you say the emergency room?

208
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:40,259
I also have some pride
and don't want you to be too comfortable.

209
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:43,888
You will be mostly on the night shift,
and you will be the surgeon on call.

210
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,389
It will be really difficult.

211
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,893
What? Is abusing my authority
also my personal revenge,

212
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,520
Oh, no.

213
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,731
Your words are extreme, Chairman.

214
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:56,066
I consider our ER
the pride of our hospital,

215
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,903
so it's only fitting a doctor like myself
should go there.

216
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:00,529
That's good then.

217
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,163
If you don't like all this,
just come to me.

218
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:13,334
Instead of a VIP doctor,
I'll turn you into a VIP.

219
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:21,592
Thank you for always closely watching
over me, Chairman.

220
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:26,680
Car accident patient.
The other hospital can't do the surgery

221
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,182
so they sent him to us.

222
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:30,226
Be careful with the line.

223
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:33,145
Who did you call?
We need an order to book an OR.

224
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,980
Doctor, over here.

225
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,318
-Secure an operating room, quickly.
-Yes.

226
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:43,447
-Please give him more blood.
-Okay.

227
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,657
-Get another IV.
-Okay.

228
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,159
-What are you doing here without a gown?
-Exactly.

229
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:50,663
As of today, I'm  Dr. Kang,
on duty around-the-clock in the ER.

230
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:51,872
Let's work together.

231
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:56,544
I've got Room 5. I called
anesthesia and the nurses' station.

232
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:58,921
-Put him in surgery right now.
-Without a CT scan?

233
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,548
We have them from the hospital.

234
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,633
He needs surgery
more than a new CT scan.

235
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:04,343
-Okay. Nurse Choi.
-Yes.

236
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,472
What about the VIP ward?

237
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,307
I got fired, of course.

238
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,309
What about the broadcast?

239
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:16,564
As of now. I will work very hard.

240
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:19,859
-In the emergency room?
-No, on the broadcast.

241
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,236
There is a car accident patient.

242
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:23,863
He will arrive in five minutes.

243
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,948
What a flashy welcome. Let's go.

244
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:28,284
The positioning is good, and he's healthy.

245
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,536
The due date is in two weeks, right?

246
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:33,163
Yes, we have 10 days left.

247
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:36,500
It must be nice to see each other
after a long time apart, but,

248
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:40,004
it would be best not to do "it"
right now. Do you understand?

249
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,800
Why aren't you responding?

250
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,512
-Yes.
-Yes.

251
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,478
Dr. Kang, over here.

252
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:02,276
You're working very hard.

253
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,278
It's nice to see you. How have you been?

254
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:07,615
You went to volunteer
and ended up dating someone.

255
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,199
I heard you're dating a soldier.

256
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:13,370
You didn't go into the wrong OR and
operate on the wrong patient, did you?

257
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:14,872
You're really funny.

258
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:18,959
It hasn't been long since the scandal yet.
You volunteer and met a man so quickly.

259
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:22,338
Is that really why you got fired
from the VIP ward?

260
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:26,967
Dr. Kim, during the month
I was volunteering,

261
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,762
I realized a few things.

262
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:33,682
We all need to be happy.
You should be happy too.

263
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,226
And while you are happy,
hone your skills.

264
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,105
Stop acting superior.

265
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:43,025
All you did was give a few vaccinations
and take some pictures.

266
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,444
How dare you play act like Schweitzer?

267
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:53,494
Oops, what's with everyone?

268
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,749
I know what everyone is thinking.

269
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:02,169
That was the saddest moment of my life.

270
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,881
What was I doing with my hands
instead of pulling her hair out?

271
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:09,426
Exactly. I had two hands,
but was doing nothing.

272
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,179
I should have flipped the tray over.

273
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,391
Isn't it okay to be wild
at a time like this?

274
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,395
The food tray?

275
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:26,110
What's with Kim Eun-ji?
She's so immature.

276
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:28,362
That's all her good fortune.

277
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:35,536
If I'm reborn, I want to be born like her
and be immature my whole life.

278
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:38,080
Then what about me?
What should I be reborn as?

279
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:42,543
You'll be reborn as a man I never meet.

280
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:44,461
Live your whole life not knowing me.

281
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,969
I deposited more money into the account.

282
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:55,055
I put more because of my bonus.
Subtract it from my balance.

283
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,099
Is there still a balance left?

284
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,517
Haven't you paid it all back?

285
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,186
Next month is the last month.

286
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,565
Thanks to you,
my youngest's tuition was sorted.

287
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,110
When will that girl ever graduate?

288
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,695
She's been sucking you dry.

289
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:11,113
Isn't she looking for a job?

290
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:15,451
I'm saying this as a person who
contributed to her tuition--

291
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,953
Don't worry. We will pay back your money.

292
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,747
Let's go back inside.

293
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,476
What are you doing?

294
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,479
They are cleaning themselves up
to go back home.

295
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:46,023
They lack in discipline!

296
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,649
Are you talking to me?

297
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:49,943
No.

298
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,572
It hasn't been 10 minutes yet.

299
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,701
You come and lay down.

300
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,870
You've been gone six months.
Is that how you want to show up?

301
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:03,290
A married man's face in broad daylight
isn't important.

302
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,000
Everything's good with the lights out.

303
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:11,131
Hope for a daughter who looks like her
mother. All the best for your future.

304
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,926
It could be a daughter
that looks like her father.

305
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,303
Come over here.

306
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,766
We will be leaving
for our last patrol duty.

307
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:22,810
-Solidarity.
-No, stay here.

308
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:29,399
I'll go instead,
so I can get some fresh air.

309
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,151
It hasn't been 10 minutes yet.

310
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:35,405
I'll give it to you
for the last five minutes.

311
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,407
Tap it on lightly.

312
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,827
He can't.

313
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:41,995
Teach this guy.

314
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,957
Work hard.

315
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,084
-Work hard.
-Praying for your safe return.

316
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:59,388
Cast off your uniform, and enter
our company to learn the business.

317
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,932
You have until your last day
of your deployment here.

318
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:06,019
And when you return,
come back with your decision.

319
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:10,023
Will you let go of her hand,

320
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,359
or will you become worthy of holding it.

321
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:18,657
That's exactly the face you make
when you're thinking about me.

322
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,620
It's my usual face.
I'm always thinking of you.

323
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:26,832
What? That was kind of sweet.

324
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,043
You should be laying down.
Why are you here?

325
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:32,504
It's boring in the ward.

326
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:38,260
Don't stand there.  Sit down.

327
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:43,599
Did you feel how light I am?

328
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:46,393
I lost weight with being sick.

329
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:51,106
-My waist is tiny. Take a look.
-No way. Put your hands right here.

330
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:58,280
When will open your present?
All you know how do to is talk.

331
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:03,118
-Move. Your face isn't that pretty.
-If I move, you'll be blinded.

332
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:06,330
If people saw us,
they'd think you love me a lot.

333
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,166
I do love you, Yoon Myeong-ju.

334
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:18,759
Are we breaking up by any chance?

335
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,347
Are we really breaking up?

336
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:26,683
I love you.

337
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:29,645
I love you very much,

338
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,439
forever.

339
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,651
But you keep breaking up with me.

340
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,488
We won't be breaking up.

341
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,615
I won't do that from now on.

342
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:51,333
Move over. You are making me go blind.

343
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,649
SPECIAL OPERATIONS HEADQUARTERS

344
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:03,322
I, Captain Yoo Si-jin, and the others

345
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,782
have completed the dispatch duty
at the Uruk Taebaek Unit.

346
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,910
I received an order to return
to the Alpha Team.

347
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,412
I report this to you, sir.

348
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,249
I salute the Deputy Commander!

349
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,709
Solidarity!

350
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:16,835
At ease.

351
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:20,756
You all worked hard.

352
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,884
The Chief Commander is currently
in Byakko training.

353
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:26,553
I will relay the message
from the chief now.

354
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:28,597
For three nights and four days,

355
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,099
Alpha Team will be taking
strategic measures.

356
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:35,687
You are to leave the base
as soon as possible. Do you understand?

357
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,147
Yes, sir!

358
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,698
MILITARY DISCHARGE APPLICATION

359
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:03,924
NAME: SEO DAE-YEONG

360
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:08,428
Just 16 hours and 43 minutes.

361
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:12,891
It's exactly 72 hours from now.

362
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:14,684
I have no objections.

363
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:16,520
Don't try running away.

364
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,773
-No sleep.
-For three days.

365
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:32,411
-Are you alright, sir?
-I feel just fine.

366
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,663
I will go get some more booze.

367
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,456
Yeah, you go do that.

368
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,544
This cell phone is a bit strange.

369
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:44,047
None of them answered my phone calls.

370
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,634
The person that shouldn't have answered
did though.

371
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:49,803
Did you have a fight with your wife?

372
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:50,971
Yes, sir.

373
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:54,141
I almost got my ass beaten,
turning the light off.

374
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:59,604
How could nobody answer this?

375
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:02,941
This guy answered your call
and now he is here.

376
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:06,486
This is my first time
since I got this cell phone.

377
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:09,573
You sound like a different guy
when you get drunk.

378
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:23,670
What is this mess?
When did these guys get here?

379
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,172
Why are you late?

380
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:27,424
The night shift just ended.

381
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,178
Are these guys usually like this?

382
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,765
Why does our reunion
have to look like this?

383
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:38,351
I was gonna make a welcome sign
and get dressed up.

384
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:40,270
I bought clothes,
even did a face mask.

385
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:42,147
The kimchi stew is good.

386
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,523
Have a bowl.

387
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,734
-Where are you going?
-Back to the unit.

388
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:46,860
I am not on break.

389
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:48,945
Why alone? Take him with you.

390
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,238
-Solidarity.
-Alright.

391
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,160
It's no sleep for three days,
so I can't take him with me.

392
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:59,372
No sleep for how many days?
They must be crazy!

393
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:02,000
The girl that just came in is so pretty.

394
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:05,253
The girl that just left is way prettier.

395
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:06,796
No way.

396
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:10,091
This woman is so much prettier, you know.

397
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:14,846
-But she is constantly staring at me.
-Don't look at her.

398
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:18,683
It would be silly
to quarrel with a civilian.

399
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,819
Win! Win!

400
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:32,614
Congratulatory drinks!

401
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,502
Hey, get up.

402
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:50,590
We are going to keep that promise
of no sleep for three days.

403
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:55,136
What are you talking about?
I am not asleep!

404
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,350
Are you asleep?

405
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,436
I am not sleeping.

406
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:07,232
Two more bottles of soju, please.

407
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:12,153
Soju... please...

408
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,240
Here are the two bottles of soju.

409
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:17,742
Thank you, Ma'am.

410
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,578
Why are you here, Dr.?

411
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,205
I don't know. Why the heck am I here?

412
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:24,624
What are you eating, instead of drinking?

413
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:28,128
Almonds. I am trying to recharge
my stamina right now.

414
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:30,130
It's so hard to keep up with these dudes.

415
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:31,715
You should try some.

416
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:34,759
I will take some.
You are getting old for crying out loud.

417
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:39,431
The woman that we saw yesterday
is here again.

418
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:44,185
I think she lives at the bar or something.

419
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:48,982
I am going to try and talk to her today.

420
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,359
Excuse me.

421
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,320
You're still alive.

422
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:56,197
Huh? Do you know me?

423
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:59,868
Of course, she knows you.
This lady here is your girlfriend.

424
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,954
Seriously? Oh, that's amazing.

425
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:06,374
Are you my girlfriend? Wow!

426
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,127
Apparently, she is my girlfriend.

427
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,504
Don't you think she's super pretty?

428
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:13,715
What's going on here, Deputy Commander?

429
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:16,051
You aren't going to drink this, are you?

430
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:35,945
Do you remember this place?

431
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,616
I get it. I get it.

432
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,826
Just take these off.

433
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:45,997
No, it's okay. I don't like taking off
my shoes at someone else's home.

434
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:47,540
Take them off and rest.

435
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,542
Are you trying to seduce me or something?

436
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:53,213
I am not the type of girl that would
eat ramen at another person's place.

437
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:55,590
I get it. I will just take off your shoes.

438
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:58,176
I will just take off your shoes.
Hold on a second here.

439
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:02,639
She's not drunk, she's got Alzheimer's.

440
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,140
Chicken and beer?

441
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:07,394
Chicken and beer, it is then!
I really like that idea.

442
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:09,521
Let's go have another.

443
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:14,442
Hurry up. What are you doing?
Let's hurry it up.

444
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,486
Let's go have another.

445
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:21,908
Let's hurry up and go have another, okay?

446
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,078
What?

447
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,436
-Mom?
-Mom?

448
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:54,190
My mom's clothes, my mom's purse,

449
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:56,151
and my mom.

450
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,954
Who is this young man?

451
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,039
Nice to meet you.

452
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:13,042
I am Dr. Kang's boyfriend, Yoo Si-jin.

453
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:16,004
You're my boyfriend? Seriously?

454
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:20,383
He said that he is my boyfriend.
He is so handsome, right, Mom?

455
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:24,053
Why do you always go too far
when you drink?

456
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:30,226
She is a real nice kid for the most part,
but she can't hold her liquor very well.

457
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,936
It's fine, Ma'am. She's quite cute.

458
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,398
I am glad that you are so understanding.

459
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:38,276
By the way, what do you do for a living?

460
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:40,695
He's a soldier and he is a captain.

461
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:42,864
But the more detailed information
is secret.

462
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:46,659
Everything has to be a secret
for the sake of regulations.

463
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:50,538
Oh, I just got the chills.
What was that memory just now?

464
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:55,210
Paycheck comes in on time, but you're not
home very often. That's nice.

465
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:59,088
Mom, why do you have to be
so brutally honest when you just met him?

466
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:00,799
I was talking about you, dear.

467
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,176
She practically lives at the hospital,

468
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:05,804
but her paycheck comes in on time.

469
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,683
But why are you standing there like that?

470
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:13,353
Did you make a mistake?

471
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:14,312
No, I didn't.

472
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:16,439
You didn't? Why not?

473
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:19,567
I am sorry. I would do it any time...

474
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:22,278
That wasn't what I meant.

475
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,865
You seem innocent, my captain.

476
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:29,536
My Mo-yeon just studied.

477
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:32,497
She's never even had a man hold her hand.

478
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:36,000
Mom! Stop.
This is going to put me at a disadvantage.

479
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:39,462
He knows about Yoon-gi
and also the Chairman.

480
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:42,715
Oh! I just got the chills.
What was that just now?

481
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,008
Why am I remembering that?

482
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:47,178
I think she needs to go to sleep.
I'll be leaving now.

483
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:49,264
No, it is okay. I should leave.

484
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:50,557
I am not old fashioned.

485
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,436
No. I am old fashioned. I will leave.
I will greet you officially next time.

486
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,188
Okay then.

487
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:16,040
I will be 10 minutes late.
Please order for me.

488
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:17,417
A club sandwich.

489
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,544
A lot of jalapenos
and leave out the onions.

490
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:22,630
Plenty of hot chili sauce
and I want toasted white bread, please.

491
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:23,798
Like this.

492
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:27,635
Two club sandwiches, right?

493
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:29,929
I will help you with the payment.

494
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:31,639
Please pay it with this.

495
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:32,974
Sure.

496
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:39,981
Did you sober up?

497
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:42,817
Of course. I didn't drink a lot.

498
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:45,069
I think you drank a lot.

499
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,863
You were a different person
when you were drunk.

500
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:50,742
That was me. I remember everything.

501
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:52,702
I don't believe that.

502
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:58,583
What did your mom say?

503
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,419
Does she like me?

504
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:04,797
You met my mom? When?

505
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,091
You said you remember everything...

506
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:09,761
Try drinking with another punk...

507
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:12,847
Oh, jealousy.

508
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:17,936
-You aren't sober yet!
-Oh! You're so smart!

509
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:20,813
Phone. Phone.

510
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:30,281
Solidarity. This is Captain Yoo Si-jin.

511
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,325
Yes, that's right.

512
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:39,332
Yes, I understand.

513
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,459
Yes. Solidarity.

514
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:51,427
I have to... go to the department store.

515
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:55,139
Oh.

516
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,265
I am sorry.

517
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:03,189
No.

518
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:09,404
Would you like to watch a movie with me
when you get back?

519
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:14,742
I'd like to.

520
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,079
Come back safely.

521
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:19,789
Thank you.

522
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:43,688
Since you were a punk as a kid,

523
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:45,189
black suits you well.

524
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:46,899
My skin complexion is kind of fair.

525
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:50,862
Your skin complexion looks really good.

526
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:56,868
One minute before the briefing.

527
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:59,370
-You feel like chatting?
-Solidarity.

528
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,416
What brings you here?

529
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:05,960
Is it NIS work?

530
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,962
I'm sure I didn't come to greet you two.

531
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,590
For this 1029 mission,

532
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,801
I'm the presiding officer.

533
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:17,597
Where's your discipline?
Get in there right away!

534
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:24,312
Study the path and check your guns.

535
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:27,398
Set our communication channel to three.

536
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:31,944
The pen can used
in the same way as before.

537
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:33,821
In case of an emergency,

538
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,491
the injection will cause painless death
within 10 seconds.

539
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:43,831
KORYO HOTEL, PYONGYANG

540
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,501
On behalf of the President, I greet you.

541
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:49,212
Welcome on behalf of our supreme leader.

542
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:55,009
Let's go.

543
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:08,815
How is the knife wound I gave you?

544
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,483
I am sorry about that.

545
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:14,070
This won't be easy.

546
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:18,866
We will need to at least beat up
some special forces soldiers

547
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:20,952
before we return to the Republic.

548
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:36,175
After losing to me, did you get appointed
to the escort forces?

549
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:37,760
I am sorry.

550
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:40,304
You still have a way with words.

551
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,893
Then without that ballpoint pen,

552
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,271
do you want to go another round
with me?

553
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:51,357
I don't think you're asking me
if I want to write a report with you.

554
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:59,532
I'm also not the type to go easy
just because this isn't my home turf.

555
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:02,243
And you still have a lot of guts.

556
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:08,040
As a guest, consider yourself lucky
we're facing the same direction.

557
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:11,043
For us soldiers,
looking in the same direction

558
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:14,255
is a truce and signifies peace.

559
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:19,010
Then let me ask you
for a favor, as a guest.

560
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,638
Can I get cold buckwheat noodles
for lunch?

561
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:26,225
I really want to have
traditional Pyongyang buckwheat noodles.

562
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,151
If you splash the vinegar
over the noodles evenly,

563
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:38,404
and mix the hot mustard into
the meat broth it will taste even better.

564
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:40,740
Thank you.

565
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:44,911
Thank you.

566
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:50,666
But there's something you need to know.

567
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,253
Don't believe the server's words.

568
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:59,258
We don't put hot mustard on the noodles
traditionally in Pyongyang.

569
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:04,805
Thank you for the information.

570
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:08,392
At the next conference,
I will treat you in the south.

571
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:12,772
There will be another team
going to the south.

572
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,441
My break starts tomorrow.

573
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:23,199
Then, I will pay the tab.

574
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:27,453
It's okay. Just enjoy.

575
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,810
How is Professor Kang doing?

576
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,687
Is it hard for her in the ER?

577
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:55,106
No, she is very energetic, unlike before.

578
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,526
What about flowers?
Are you sending them daily?

579
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:00,778
Every time we send them,
they are refused,

580
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:03,864
but the office smells very lovely.

581
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:08,828
What about Doctor Kang's boyfriend?
Did you find out?

582
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:10,371
It is a bit strange.

583
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,748
Even the army
didn't have any information.

584
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:18,045
They just know he's a member of
the special forces. But I have a picture.

585
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,464
This...

586
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:22,258
Which one?

587
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:26,512
-I still haven't found that out yet.
-What?

588
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:32,059
It's him. Dr. Kang Mo-yeon's boyfriend
is this person.

589
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,437
Born in 1983. His name is Yoo Si-jin.

590
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,690
A captain in the Korean army.
He's a Pisces and his blood type is A.

591
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:41,235
Ah! This person.

592
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:44,780
But this person is this person.

593
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,407
Yeah. Then...

594
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,038
Hey, wait a minute!

595
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:55,750
Can I talk to you a bit?

596
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,671
You two have a good time.

597
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,683
So you are Dr. Kang's boy--

598
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,355
Is your injury okay?

599
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:21,275
I don't know if you are actually calm,
or just pretending to be.

600
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:24,653
If the reason Dr. Kang rejected me
was because of you...

601
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,697
it hurts my pride a lot.

602
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,409
Anyway, you're a special forces captain?

603
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,287
Are you a good fighter?

604
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:39,210
I heard you took her to a hotel
on the first date.

605
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:40,878
My girlfriend.

606
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:46,759
In any case, please be careful.

607
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:50,346
Whether it's during the day
or at night, or if it's with you...

608
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:54,141
I am a great fighter.

609
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:01,357
Seriously.

610
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:04,568
Kang Mo-yeon,
can you be on-call instead of me?

611
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:05,653
I don't want to.

612
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:08,781
I'm asking you to be on-call.
You hate it that much?

613
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:10,116
Yes, I don't like it.

614
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:13,953
I'm not the Kang Mo-yeon
who takes your duties anymore, so just go.

615
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:16,956
Hey, all the on-call duties
at this hospital were given to you.

616
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:18,374
What are you saying?

617
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:22,378
You're right. I do all on-call duties,
but I don't want yours too.

618
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:26,674
Already back from the department store?

619
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:29,009
I finished to meet you
when you got off work.

620
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:31,720
The department store isn't closed yet.

621
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:34,348
It's a department store
that you can't even imagine.

622
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:37,893
I know department stores better than you.

623
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:40,438
Who is this?
Aren't you going to introduce us?

624
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:43,566
You got paged. It seems very urgent.

625
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:45,317
I didn't bring my cellphone.

626
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:51,657
I'm Kim Eun-ji. I'm Doctor Kang's friend.
Pleased to meet you.

627
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:56,495
I'm Yoo Si-jin. I'm Dr. Kang's boyfriend.
Pleased to meet you.

628
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,289
Don't be too pleased.

629
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:02,751
So this is the soldier boyfriend
I've heard rumors about?

630
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:04,545
I'm off now!

631
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:06,297
Well then...

632
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:13,012
How annoying.
How can a soldier be so handsome?

633
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:16,098
Pleased to meet her?

634
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:17,558
Why are you so pleased? 

635
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:18,851
Are you crazy?

636
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:20,186
Are you talking about me?

637
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:22,688
No. That fox-like wench earlier.

638
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:25,774
The timing was strange.

639
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:28,736
Couldn't you tell that we
weren't close at all?

640
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,905
I made it obvious that I don't like her,

641
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:33,240
but you still introduced yourself?

642
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:37,203
You're so detailed at work,
why are you so clueless in society?

643
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:40,206
Are you jealous right now?

644
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:45,377
If you knew who I just met,
you wouldn't be like this to me.

645
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:46,670
What? Who was it?

646
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:48,714
-Did you meet with the Chairman?
-Yes.

647
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:52,218
Did you get hurt anywhere?
I'm really worried.

648
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:55,471
You didn't eat, did you?
Why didn't you eat?

649
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:57,139
Let's go. I'll buy you dinner.

650
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:59,808
The timing is still strange.

651
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:02,561
Oh my! Look at how pretty the fountain is.

652
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:04,480
Is this Rococo style?

653
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:05,648
I said to stand still.

654
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:07,691
Why don't we talk about
the Chairman more?

655
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:10,027
Look at the lights!

656
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:12,154
Stop talking and stand still.

657
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:14,156
Why? To talk about what?

658
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,407
What are you doing now?

659
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:20,329
I thought I could grasp you
with one hand, I was right.

660
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,290
See, I bought you a gift.

661
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:26,919
Did you just measure my neck?
By nearly strangling me?

662
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:31,799
My hand just went very close to your neck.

663
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:36,220
Sergeant First Class Seo and
First Lieutenant Yoon are waiting.

664
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:38,222
If I give it to you later, it'll be weird.

665
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:44,895
It's pretty.

666
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:48,816
Usually people ask,
"Do you like it?" first.

667
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:51,026
Oh, do you like it?

668
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:53,028
Yes. Aren't I very pretty?

669
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:57,116
-Really pretty.
-Let's go then.

670
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:03,831
But I'm not someone who gets over thing
easily when they receive gifts.

671
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:06,250
Sure. But you're smiling now.

672
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:08,711
-It's true.
-I get it.

673
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:15,718
It's been ages since you've been here.

674
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:18,512
Your girlfriends have changed, I see.

675
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:22,725
You came with a wolf
and a rabbit last time.

676
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:25,561
The stuffed animals. Enjoy.

677
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:31,859
This is my real girlfriend.

678
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:34,486
This is my comrade.

679
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:35,654
Comrade?

680
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:38,574
We fought together in Uruk and won.

681
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:43,829
Was it just the two of you here?

682
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:47,916
When did you come here
with stuffed animals?

683
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,712
Your boyfriend was looking
for his cellphone that had your photos.

684
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:54,298
He almost died while fighting
against 17 guys.

685
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:56,508
It was the toughest battle of my life.

686
00:43:56,842 --> 00:43:59,428
What pictures of me?
My pictures are probably all deleted.

687
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:02,473
I never said they
were pictures of Myeong-ju.

688
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:04,516
You said it was good but not honorable.

689
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:08,062
Oh, it was the funeral home
in front of Haesung Hospital.

690
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:10,939
Ah, that fight I saw
on the security footage?

691
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:13,192
Ah, now that I think about it,

692
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:14,777
it was the day we first met.

693
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:17,571
Seriously!

694
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:20,949
There aren't any pictures of me.

695
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:22,910
How could you delete everything?

696
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:26,038
And also, what is this?

697
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:29,166
Are you selling used cars part-time?

698
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:31,377
Ah, what is this?

699
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:34,463
You put me through all that
just to get this?

700
00:44:34,546 --> 00:44:36,256
To me, those are Myeong-ju's photos.

701
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,217
Is that what my face looks like to you?

702
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:42,763
I didn't know how to date.

703
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:44,932
So whenever I saw Myeong-ju, I just drank.

704
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:47,601
So I couldn't even take her home,

705
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,895
and I always sent her off in a taxi.

706
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:52,481
These are the license plates
of those taxis.

707
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:56,819
When we broke up,
I deleted the pictures we took together.

708
00:44:57,361 --> 00:45:01,990
But I thought I could insist that these
weren't Myeong-ju's pictures,

709
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:03,075
so I kept them.

710
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:06,537
Wow. Sergeant First Class Seo,
you're great.

711
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:10,582
I think I just fell for you again.

712
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:15,796
Is it just the two of you here?

713
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:18,799
But First Lieutenant Yoon,

714
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:21,468
you know
Sergeant First Class Seo's passcode?

715
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:23,137
I made it up for him.

716
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:26,098
He thinks it's is the only pattern
you can choose.

717
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:31,979
When you buy a cellphone,
they give you a little booklet.

718
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:34,857
The cellphone instructions
are written in detail.

719
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:38,277
It's okay.
In my world, that is the only pattern.

720
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:42,740
-Let's go.
-How have we not left yet?

721
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:48,328
Get home safe.

722
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:53,083
Is it just the two of you here?

723
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:54,960
Hurry up and go.

724
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:03,886
Were those photos that important?

725
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:06,638
So cute!

726
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:18,192
But why are you going this direction?

727
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:22,654
Are you taking me home now?

728
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,823
When a grown man and woman are dating,

729
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:27,034
they aren't supposed to go home early.

730
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:29,036
Once you're home,
shouldn't you loosen up a bit?

731
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,829
Why are you so rigid?

732
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:33,540
Maybe I really won't send you home.

733
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,334
That's exactly what I mean.

734
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:38,545
It's noisy. Just answer your phone.

735
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:51,475
-Who was it?
-It was someone I don't know.

736
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:53,894
-It was someone you know.
-It wasn't.

737
00:46:57,189 --> 00:47:01,109
-Is it Yoon-gi who used to buy you food?
-It really isn't Yoon-gi.

738
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:03,737
And also, I think you're mistaken.

739
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:06,323
I bought the ginseng chicken soup--

740
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:09,034
SERGEANT KIM BUM-RAE

741
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:12,704
Wait...

742
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:16,834
Do you think I bought the car with this
function just so you can grab my phone?

743
00:47:19,878 --> 00:47:21,964
Reporting in.
This is Sergeant Kim Bum-rae.

744
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:24,800
Sergeant Seo did nothing out of
the ordinary today.

745
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:27,386
He fixed his hair with wax three times
before leaving.

746
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:29,721
It wasn't three times, it was only twice.

747
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:33,892
-Solidarity! Sergeant Kim Bum-rae!
-I'll be back at 20:00.

748
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:37,145
Make ramen and be on standby.
Make the noodles yourself.

749
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:44,987
It's just a habit.

750
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:48,615
A person can't change overnight.

751
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,145
I'm not going to.

752
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:21,273
It's punishment.

753
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,460
You cooked the ramen well.

754
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:44,004
But the noodles are flour.

755
00:48:45,547 --> 00:48:46,757
Ah, that...

756
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:49,092
-Kim Bum-rae.
-Sergeant Kim Bum-rae.

757
00:48:49,968 --> 00:48:51,970
Do you want to be on the same side as me,

758
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:54,348
or do you want
to become the chewy noodles?

759
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:59,394
Sergeant First Class Seo
returned at 20:00.

760
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:01,688
Currently at 21:00, he is good-looking.

761
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:04,441
At 22:00,
he plans to still be good-looking.

762
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:07,277
He is planning on going to sleep
while being good-looking.

763
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:10,739
End of report.

764
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:14,785
Right. The Chief Commander
is returning tomorrow.

765
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:18,580
Yes. Yes, I understand. Solidarity.

766
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:28,507
I got a good deal.

767
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:36,181
Solidarity.

768
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:40,060
-I have a request for you, Commander.
-I received your report.

769
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:42,562
Let's have some tea. Have a seat.

770
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:46,108
Thank you for the offer, but I'll do it
another day on a different occasion.

771
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:51,321
Okay, then.

772
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:54,533
Can I take this as your decision?

773
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:59,496
-What is that?
-Seo Dae-yeong's discharge request.

774
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:06,086
-Dad.
-Yes, it is.

775
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:09,214
I'll turn in my uniform.

776
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,469
You're still making him do this?

777
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:17,597
You're making him turn in his uniform
after I begged?

778
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:22,436
First Lieutenant Yoon said
that she heard all of our conversation.

779
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:25,564
When First Lieutenant Yoon was bedridden,

780
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:28,066
she begged me to let you keep your job.

781
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:31,820
She told me if she fully recovered,
I should approve of you

782
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:33,238
and not to discharge you.

783
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:37,576
That was a promise  between the Commander
and First Lieutenant Yoon.

784
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:39,411
It does not matter to me.

785
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:42,456
-Seo Dae-yeong...
-My choice is First Lieutenant Yoon.

786
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:45,917
If there is a price to pay for my choice,
then I will gladly pay it.

787
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,420
I will cast aside my uniform.

788
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:51,089
With whose permission?

789
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:54,009
Let's talk. Come outside.

790
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:02,267
That is all.

791
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:06,730
Solidarity.

792
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:22,954
How can you do this to me?

793
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:25,332
How can you let me find out this way? How?

794
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:27,501
-I know how you feel--
-Don't pretend you do.

795
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:29,920
If you knew, you wouldn't.

796
00:51:30,712 --> 00:51:32,672
I made the decision to not break up.

797
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:34,508
Do you think that was easy?

798
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:36,635
It's not easy. I know.

799
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:40,847
But what about me?
Do you think it was easy for me?

800
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:44,768
It was a promise I received
after using my life to threaten my dad.

801
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:46,853
You think it was easy to be so shameless?

802
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:48,855
So why did you do that?

803
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:54,069
Because you keep running away.

804
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:58,365
Where were you when I was fighting my dad?

805
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:01,451
Do I look like a fool?

806
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:06,623
How could you, without even a word,
without any discussion--

807
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:08,583
I did discuss it with you. Many times.

808
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:12,045
All the times I ran away
spoke hundreds of words

809
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:16,508
and those times I couldn't answer your
phone calls are thousands of discussions.

810
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:21,388
You asked the Commander
for a promise like that?

811
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:27,435
I guess we both saw each other
as fools.

812
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:29,771
How is that the same?

813
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:32,232
I tried to make my dad understand–

814
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:34,109
That's why I became a fool.

815
00:52:37,028 --> 00:52:39,447
It's not an understanding I need,
but an acceptance.

816
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:43,160
Not "my daughter wanted him,"
but because of my choice.

817
00:52:43,785 --> 00:52:48,081
I hoped the Commander would choose me
because of who I am.

818
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:56,381
But... if the Commander's permission

819
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:59,968
is simply to fulfill a
dying daughter's wish...

820
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:06,474
I won't stay with you.

821
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:18,278
Fine. Then don't.

822
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:24,951
Let's end this.

823
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,250
If you are going to be miserable
because of me,

824
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:36,254
just be happy on your own.

825
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:38,006
I'm being sincere.

826
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:07,786
Wow, we finally get to watch this movie.

827
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:09,829
It took a while.

828
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:12,916
I'm happy to be here again.

829
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:15,293
Even if it took a while?

830
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:19,339
Let's make sure we go back there again.

831
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:22,592
To that beach.
We did take a stone after all.

832
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:26,513
Sure. Let's make sure to go back there.

833
00:54:27,555 --> 00:54:28,473
The two of us.

834
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,478
Who is it?

835
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:37,065
Oh my...

836
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:39,067
Is there something wrong?

837
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:42,195
I think I have to go.

838
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,239
Right now?

839
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:46,074
Yes, I'm sorry.

840
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:50,203
Am I getting blown off now?

841
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:52,247
I'm sorry. It's an emergency.

842
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:53,957
We'll watch this together later.

843
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,709
For now, let's leave together.

844
00:54:56,501 --> 00:54:59,754
No. I'll just watch this and go.
You can leave.

845
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:10,265
That only has an effect on our first date.

846
00:55:10,598 --> 00:55:13,560
I paid for it, we have to watch together.
Hurry and get up.

847
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:18,732
Oh, so close. I thought it would work.

848
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:22,652
We're not watching this movie again.

849
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:30,452
On Thursday at 13:00, during the
second special North-South meeting,

850
00:55:30,535 --> 00:55:33,580
Blue House secret service will guard
the areas around the VIP.

851
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:40,128
From our unit, three teams of 707-Alpha,
Bravo, and Charlie will join as backup.

852
00:55:40,211 --> 00:55:43,423
We will survey the locations
where threats to the 17th floor may occur

853
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:45,467
and then we'll guard the perimeter.

854
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:48,803
The Alpha Team Captain will be in charge
during rehearsal

855
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:50,472
and on the day of the meeting.

856
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:00,607
Notifying all team members.

857
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:03,485
Rest for five minutes
until the rehearsal vehicle arrives.

858
00:56:03,568 --> 00:56:05,904
That's all. End of transmission.

859
00:56:12,577 --> 00:56:14,079
Are you eating alone?

860
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:18,208
It's too small for two people.

861
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:20,001
You only bought one?

862
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:22,629
I bought two but finished them both.
I'm craving sweets.

863
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:24,339
I think I'm depressed.

864
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:28,051
What kind of depression
comes on so quickly?

865
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:29,636
I broke up with First Lieutenant Yoon.

866
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:33,431
What?

867
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:37,936
Why? Who dumped who?

868
00:56:38,019 --> 00:56:40,980
I got dumped.
I cannot tell you the reason--

869
00:56:57,455 --> 00:56:59,791
-An ambulance is coming in.
-Let's go.

870
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:12,887
He's had two liters of saline
and his BP is 80/50.

871
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:15,557
-There are multiple gunshot wounds.
-Gunshot wounds?

872
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:19,394
Take X-rays then go straight into surgery.

873
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:24,566
Please page more doctors.

874
00:57:24,649 --> 00:57:26,401
I've got it. You take that patient.

875
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:30,488
How's the patient?

876
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:27,587
Even with your jokes, I don't feel better.

877
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:30,048
I'm so worried about you.

878
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:46,272
If you are worrying about me, please stop.

879
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:51,903
Please look after Captain Yoo.

880
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:55,114
Because I like him a lot

881
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:58,117
and I'm planning on telling him
when he comes back.

882
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:27,897
