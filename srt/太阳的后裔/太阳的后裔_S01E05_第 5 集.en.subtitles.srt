1
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,454
You must want this badly.

2
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:39,831
Here.

3
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,753
I can improvise.

4
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,406
Good night.

5
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,078
Since you gave this to me...

6
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:12,841
EPISODE 5

7
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,397
We were comrades.

8
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:31,568
We did three joint operations.

9
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,571
So what you're saying is...

10
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,448
that you too--

11
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:38,616
So let's...

12
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:42,579
not talk about that.

13
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,409
Have you been well?
Not causing any trouble?

14
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,203
Can't you see?

15
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:26,206
Can't you tell me
when you decide to come and go?

16
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,041
Three months in Libya...

17
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:30,126
and a month in North Uruk
with Chen Gang...

18
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,503
Way to go. Picking such dangerous places.

19
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:33,922
This is the most dangerous.

20
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:37,091
Nothing was as dangerous
as having my wife point a gun at me.

21
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:39,969
Did you come back with Chen Gang?

22
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,477
When?

23
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:14,295
Solar energy generation
does not harm the environment.

24
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:17,548
It is a safe, eco-friendly power plant.

25
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:20,385
The peaceful reconstruction work began

26
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:22,095
after the war ended in Uruk.

27
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:25,390
In the solar power sector,
the Haesung Group is

28
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:28,059
proudly number one in the entire world.

29
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:29,852
Beating out Germany,

30
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:34,691
we managed to win the construction rights
for the power plant.

31
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,109
-Hello.
-Hello.

32
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,944
Yes, hello.

33
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:41,197
You know, when I go outside
and spot signs in Korean...

34
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,116
I get sentimental for no reason.

35
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,119
Koreans all become patriots
when they're overseas.

36
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:47,954
It looks amazing.

37
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,039
I would like to go up there.

38
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:53,001
It's quite something, isn't it?

39
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,631
-Assistant Manager?
-What? Oh, yes.

40
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,885
This is the Chief Manager.

41
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,474
I'm not from the Haesung Group.

42
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,519
I'm Mr. Jin, Chief Manager
of Uruk Electric Power Corporation.

43
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:13,646
My full name is Jin Young-soo.

44
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,315
-My English name is...
-Receipt?

45
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:20,820
Richard.

46
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,239
Jin Young-soo!

47
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,408
Jin Young-soo.

48
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:29,912
Let's just call him Manager Jin,
like we would in Korea.

49
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,250
-I told you to address me properly.
-Okay.

50
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:39,839
I'm not a construction worker like him.

51
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:43,468
I'm managing the Uruk Electric Power
Corporation's on-site project.

52
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:47,347
I'm the person in charge here.

53
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:52,685
The team leader or anyone in charge
can talk with me

54
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:55,146
about the construction work.

55
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,780
No team leaders here?

56
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,742
Hello? It's me.

57
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:10,495
Mo-Yeon, I have good news and bad news.

58
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:11,662
Good news first.

59
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:14,165
You know the kid who suffered from
lead poisoning,

60
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,084
I found out that his name is Blakey.

61
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:19,253
Good job. What is the bad news?

62
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,547
Blakey is gone.

63
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:22,799
What?

64
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:26,761
When did you last see him?

65
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:28,471
At 09:00.

66
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:32,308
I checked the IV injection
and left to bring him some snacks.

67
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,104
Blakey left this.

68
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:39,357
I guess it means he went home.

69
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:42,819
-Do you want me to go find him?
-Are you Tarzan?

70
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,738
We are surrounded by mountains,
water and trees. How?

71
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,573
I will go ask Captain Yoo for help.

72
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,575
Why? Don't even think about it.

73
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:52,662
He's here already.

74
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,630
Let me see the drawing.

75
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:05,716
Here you go. This is what Blakey drew.

76
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,219
Blakey drew a rough map?

77
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:11,305
Yes. Do you know where it is?

78
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:13,850
It is Tarsier Wood.

79
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,726
Cat Rock is next to the woods.

80
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,729
Blakey is the name of a village.

81
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:19,814
This village.

82
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,943
Blakey is the name of a village?

83
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:25,778
You didn't even find out his name.

84
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,280
Clench your teeth.

85
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:32,201
I will go find him.
I will take care of it.

86
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,121
Is it far from here?

87
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,791
Children in this village come here
to get cookies.

88
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,877
It's a quarter of a day on foot.

89
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,088
We have no choice.

90
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,091
Conduct medical checks for the workers
with Dr. Song today.

91
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,009
I'll go find him.

92
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,385
Alone?

93
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,803
Stop clenching.

94
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:54,807
How can I go alone? I'll go with him.
He knows where things are.

95
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,685
Is that okay?

96
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,233
We will leave in ten minutes.

97
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,162
Look ahead. We'll have an accident.

98
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,794
This is the only way to the village.
We will find him on the way.

99
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,922
Glad to hear that.

100
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,760
Did you sleep well last night?

101
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,845
You didn't let me sleep.

102
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:36,557
About last night...

103
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,726
I'm trying not to talk about it.

104
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:40,436
Don't you see that?

105
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:42,897
Why are you avoiding it?

106
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,191
Because I'm confused.

107
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:50,279
I will try to avoid it
until I get myself sorted.

108
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,117
It's okay to avoid it or get angry at me,

109
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,995
but I don't want you to feel bad
about last night.

110
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:01,791
I finally did it after hesitating
like a thousand times.

111
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:22,603
There he is.

112
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,447
Once in the morning.

113
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,787
Once in the evening. Okay?

114
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,042
Did she say thank you?

115
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,296
She wouldn't tell you to get lost,
would she?

116
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:57,138
Aren't those kids the ones
who were picking up scrap metal?

117
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:58,764
You have a good memory.

118
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:01,892
-So, I can't forget things easily.
-Forget what?

119
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,186
Anything.

120
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,939
So I don't want you to do

121
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,025
or say something impressive.

122
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:19,160
What?

123
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,621
Are you supposed to get

124
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,956
such good supplies
when you get deployed?

125
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,876
It's to boost confidence.
There's soldiers from many countries.

126
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,503
Companies in Korea send these.

127
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,257
Thank you so much.

128
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:34,175
Okay.

129
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,470
How's your father doing?

130
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,388
He is doing fine.

131
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:43,934
It seems there are close ties between
the Commander and me.

132
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:47,980
See? I met you again in a foreign country.

133
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:57,531
I'm sorry. Excuse me.
It is an important call.

134
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,493
Go ahead. You should answer.
Is it the Commander?

135
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,953
This is a more important call. Solidarity.

136
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,915
It's me. Report.

137
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,250
He ate dinner at 19:00.

138
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:12,254
He went to the gym at 20:00
and worked out.

139
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,174
He came back to the barracks at
21:00 and nagged us.

140
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:17,134
At 21:30, he went to...

141
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:20,846
Then what?

142
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,811
At 21:40...

143
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:28,813
We made eye contact.

144
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:32,358
What? I'm jealous.

145
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,068
And?

146
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:36,987
He is walking towards me.

147
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:39,865
One step. Two steps.

148
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:44,662
What should I do?

149
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,080
What should you do?

150
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:49,041
Hang up the phone.

151
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:53,170
Lieutenant Yoon is a Lieutenant.

152
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,631
You are Master Sergeant.

153
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:59,427
What is the first thing to do
when you get caught by the enemy?

154
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,722
-Surrender?
-Do whatever you are told.

155
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:04,557
What did I tell you to do?

156
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:07,268
I got to hear his voice today.

157
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,980
I have to go.

158
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,232
Thank you. Solidarity!

159
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:16,944
-I'm sorry, Sir.
-Kim Bum-rae.

160
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:18,070
Sergeant Kim Bum-rae.

161
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:21,532
-Would you rather run laps or cook ramen?
-I will cook ramen for you.

162
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,536
Then you will make the broth
out of your sweat. Run.

163
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,247
I should go wash then.

164
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:34,170
You've got a letter. Solidarity.

165
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,488
It's very manly of you
to choose a restaurant.

166
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,198
Master Sergeant Seo is a regular.

167
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,450
I prefer the gourmet post exchange.

168
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,911
Instant food is my favorite.

169
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,287
Yeah, right.

170
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,624
Thank you for today. This is my treat.

171
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:13,626
Okay.

172
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,339
As I'm buying this,

173
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:20,549
can I ask you one difficult question?

174
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:26,138
I've been curious about this.
Why did you become a soldier?

175
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,642
And don't say because of
the uniform fantasy.

176
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,896
Someone has to be a soldier.

177
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,195
You don't seem to like my job.

178
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,572
That's why you are confused now.

179
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:50,746
I wondered how patriotic you have to be
to risk your life for your country.

180
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,997
What is patriotism?

181
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:56,961
You love the country and are loyal
to the country and the people.

182
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:58,629
You think only soldiers are like that?

183
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:06,262
I'm not sure what you think patriotism is.

184
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:10,391
Faith that children, beautiful women
and the elderly should be protected.

185
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,769
The courage to step in

186
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:16,856
when you see high school kids
smoking cigarettes.

187
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:20,860
The belief that you wouldn't change
even in front of a gun.

188
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:24,864
The honor of a soldier you save.

189
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,285
That's what patriotism is to me.

190
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:40,629
I have a question too.

191
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,507
What if I wasn't a soldier

192
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,843
but an ordinary man from a rich family?

193
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:48,220
Would it be easier?

194
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:53,559
No. That sounds too ordinary for me.

195
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,227
I knew it.

196
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:59,607
I should have said, "A handsome man
from a rich family".

197
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:31,430
I paid. Let's go.

198
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:38,062
Do you remember where
the hardware store is?

199
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,897
You made sure of it.

200
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:42,232
Around that corner, across the road.

201
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:44,902
That's right. Can you get there alone?

202
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:46,737
Is something wrong?

203
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:48,530
I'm on duty this afternoon.

204
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,699
Then borrow a car and drive back.

205
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,534
I'll call the store for you.

206
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,870
Can I ask what's going on?

207
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:58,082
I suddenly have to go to the headquarters.

208
00:15:58,165 --> 00:15:59,375
Thanks for the meal.

209
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,378
Is the Arab thing still a problem?
Will you get yelled at?

210
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:06,298
I will get yelled at,
but because of a report.

211
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,759
We act as civil servants as well.

212
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:10,844
I see.

213
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,768
Go, then. I will watch you go.

214
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,691
Is anyone in?

215
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,068
Ye-hwa.

216
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:29,321
Is anyone...
Oh my god! You scared me.

217
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,074
Doctor Kang? Captain Yoo called.

218
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:35,494
I see. Pleased to meet you.
I'm Kang Mo-yeon.

219
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:36,829
I'm Doctor Daniel.

220
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:40,249
I'm half-Korean,
so my pronunciation's a bit off.

221
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:43,002
It's okay to laugh if you want to.

222
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:44,753
You sound just fine.

223
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,048
Are you a doctor?

224
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,883
I fix people and things.

225
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:53,178
And I help cows give birth sometimes too.
You need a car, right?

226
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:13,449
I must not be one.

227
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,942
The local gang caused a commotion.

228
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:31,443
Here's the key.

229
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:32,986
Was anyone hurt?

230
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:35,906
They'd have called
if they needed a doctor.

231
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:37,157
Would you like some tea?

232
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,034
Yes, thanks.

233
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:50,087
How do you know Captain Yoo?

234
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,464
I guess I should say...

235
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:55,008
we meet at funerals.

236
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:59,638
In Iraq, Afghanistan, and here in Uruk.

237
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,640
We meet at funerals.

238
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:07,896
I'm a bit reluctant to ask you this,

239
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:11,483
but this might be my only chance.

240
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:18,657
Do you know what Captain Yoo does exactly?

241
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,579
Lieutenant Yoo Si-jin.

242
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:27,207
Number 05-10051.

243
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,670
Republic of Korea Special Forces.

244
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,422
Lieutenant Yoo Si-jin.

245
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,598
Number 05-10051.

246
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:46,059
Republic of Korea Special...

247
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,200
Our man is safe. We're pulling back.

248
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,911
There's one more prisoner
in the basement.

249
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,746
The missing Delta Team Captain.

250
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:08,457
No time.
This place will be bombed in five minutes.

251
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,125
Then we better hurry.

252
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,888
Everyone's onboard.

253
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,140
Let's go home then.

254
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:37,879
You're right.

255
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,966
I went against God's will for no reason.

256
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:43,635
A dying man...

257
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,806
must have been dying for a reason.

258
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,832
Do you have any more questions?

259
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:15,709
No.

260
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:19,046
That's enough.

261
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,841
Enough for what?

262
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,177
To understand?

263
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,846
Or to stay away?

264
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:36,897
BIG BOSS

265
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,407
Oh, no!

266
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:30,242
Oh, no...

267
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:33,286
Hello? Hello?

268
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,664
Captain Yoo?

269
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:38,375
You borrowed a car like I said.

270
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,169
Where are you?

271
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:44,172
I'm done here and am about to leave.

272
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:48,969
Please save me. Please save me.

273
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:50,470
Where are you?

274
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:55,767
-What do you see? Tell me what you see.
-The car is...

275
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,062
hanging off the cliff.

276
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:00,188
Do you hear me?

277
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:01,565
Yes.

278
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,401
Hang in there. I'm coming.

279
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:06,027
I'll find you.

280
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:21,376
Hello? Hello? Si-jin.

281
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,128
Don't hang up.

282
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:28,800
Save me.

283
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:30,635
Is anyone there?

284
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,762
Save me!

285
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:38,810
Mom.

286
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:41,771
Keep the annuity insurance and savings.

287
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:45,734
Don't cancel any of the policies, okay?

288
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:50,363
I'm really sorry for saying
all those mean things.

289
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,908
I love you, Mom.

290
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:55,452
And Ji-soo.

291
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:01,791
The building I signed the lease for
to open my clinic,

292
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,293
I need you

293
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:05,295
to get the deposit back.

294
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:08,715
Say goodbye to Tae-won for me.

295
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:12,552
I wish you both...

296
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:15,639
This sucks!

297
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:17,682
Is this how I die?

298
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,492
-Si-jin.
-Don't move.

299
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:37,410
Open the windows.

300
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:46,461
Don't sit at the front.
You're tilting it further. We'll fall.

301
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:47,629
Lean back.

302
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:51,633
The rocks won't hold us.

303
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,177
-I'm going to drop the car.
-What?

304
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:55,470
No way!

305
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,722
-Look at me.
-I can't do this.

306
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,057
Look at me, Dr. Kang!

307
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:02,561
Look into my eyes.

308
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,439
You can trust me.

309
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:08,817
Hold my hands tight.

310
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,320
Close your eyes for a bit.

311
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:15,615
I will get you out of here. I promise.

312
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:17,742
No.

313
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:22,372
-Let go of the brakes.
-No, I won't.

314
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:02,621
Are you okay?

315
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:03,705
Are you hurt?

316
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:11,087
Are you hurt anywhere?

317
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,132
What do you think?

318
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:17,177
You lunatic!

319
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,471
How could you just...

320
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:21,848
You're insane!

321
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:29,856
My heart's beating like crazy.

322
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,029
I'm fine.

323
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:39,783
You managed to hit me,
so you're fine, too.

324
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:41,326
Let's go.

325
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:44,037
Just a minute.

326
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,955
I can't get up.

327
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:48,541
I'm not a soldier.

328
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,252
Do you know how scared I was?

329
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:53,546
I thought I was going to die.

330
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:58,843
I can't leave you alone.

331
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:01,554
When I did, you ended up on a cliff.

332
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:05,100
Where would you go
if I put you on a train alone?

333
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:09,396
Don't make me laugh.

334
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:11,398
I'm too weak to laugh.

335
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:31,960
Solidarity. Keep up the good work.

336
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:36,297
Take this.

337
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:39,384
Your shirt is see-through now.

338
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:41,553
Why are you just giving me this now?

339
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:43,722
I already saw everything.

340
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,891
And I don't want anyone else to.

341
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:48,560
Get some rest.

342
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:53,022
What? Hey.

343
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:55,108
Hey!

344
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,074
You guys.

345
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:04,492
Where's the boss?

346
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,277
You punk.

347
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:25,573
I know all the places you sneak off
to nap.

348
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:28,868
I'd rather get paid less
and not do overtime.

349
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:31,955
Do you think you own the company?

350
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:34,874
If you want to pick your hours,
start your own company.

351
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,502
Wait and see.

352
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:38,795
As soon as we get back,

353
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:42,590
-I'll report you to the Ministry of Labor.
-Manager! Manager!

354
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,133
Come quickly.

355
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,052
"Safety first, safety first."

356
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:51,683
-He is here. The one they call son of--
-Not now.

357
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:55,979
Hello, Chief Manager.

358
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:57,772
You could've sent the guys.

359
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:00,066
You didn't have to cross
the border yourself.

360
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:02,360
Thank you for checking
the materials yourself.

361
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:05,572
But why did you drive yourself?

362
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:07,782
Where's your driver?

363
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:14,622
He left the company.

364
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,374
Don't worry about him.

365
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:18,042
Get back to work.

366
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:19,752
Don't we have a deadline to meet?

367
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:33,683
Blood?

368
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,750
I only have instant coffee.

369
00:31:58,833 --> 00:31:59,918
Do you mind?

370
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,128
Pervert.

371
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:09,761
Oh, that?

372
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:11,888
Your underwear?

373
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:14,015
Black?

374
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,017
It was dark blue.

375
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,353
Did you think I really didn't know?

376
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:22,148
What would you be if not a soldier?

377
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:26,277
-Was that a question?
-It was a monologue.

378
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,573
Tell me if you need a sedative.

379
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:32,033
I'll get you some.

380
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:35,036
You must have been in shock.

381
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:37,872
I had no time to even be in shock.

382
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:44,462
Are you concerned for me?

383
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:46,422
I should be.

384
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:48,591
I owe you my life.

385
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:53,054
Saving your life is what it takes
to get your attention.

386
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:58,893
On the cliff.

387
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:04,023
Did you know...

388
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:06,651
you risked your life to save mine?

389
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:10,196
You told me to save you.

390
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:14,951
When we first met, you said...

391
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:18,371
you ran through a shower of bullets...

392
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:20,373
to save a comrade.

393
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:23,668
About you...

394
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:26,963
going to save Private Ryan.

395
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,341
It wasn't a joke, was it?

396
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:39,142
So, did you save him?

397
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:49,068
Everyone's onboard.

398
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:52,780
Let's go home them.

399
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:24,854
Sir.

400
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:35,573
Sir.

401
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,283
Stay with me.

402
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:39,368
Stay with me.

403
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:49,754
I did.

404
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,552
For the first time...

405
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,680
today I regretted it.

406
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:10,525
When you sent me away,

407
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,277
you lied to me, didn't you?

408
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:18,407
Now I come to think of it,
you came to rescue me too fast...

409
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:20,993
to have stopped by the headquarters.

410
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:25,373
You were lying when you said
you had to go to there, weren't you?

411
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,919
The gun shot that I heard at the store,

412
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:31,754
it was you, wasn't it?

413
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:36,717
A lot of thoughts must have gone
through your mind.

414
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:40,596
Can't you have trust and leave it to me?

415
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:43,975
Oh, my goodness.

416
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:47,645
Because you are like this,

417
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,482
it gets more complicated.

418
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:02,201
It's a blackout.
The power supply is not so good here.

419
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:04,745
It'll come back on after 30 seconds.

420
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:06,372
I see.

421
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:15,464
I'll scream if you try anything strange.

422
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:26,434
-Thank you for saving me today.
-Still, you can't do anything weird to me.

423
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:30,980
All right, I won't.

424
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:49,457
Have you been looking at me
like that the whole time?

425
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:53,002
-How have I been looking at you?
-A look I can't turn away from.

426
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:56,464
You must have had
a lot of experience with women.

427
00:36:57,298 --> 00:37:01,093
Funny men always have
beautiful women next to them.

428
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:05,765
Haven't you only seen the boring men
next to a funny guy like me?

429
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:09,060
I've seen you staring
at their biceps every morning.

430
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:10,561
It's what I live for now.

431
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:13,731
This is what I get for saving you?

432
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,859
What should we do about the car?

433
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:19,946
-We should call the store first, right?
-I already did.

434
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:23,741
And I will recover the car
tomorrow morning.

435
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:52,019
You could have just saved me.
Did you have to drown the car?

436
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,940
I shouldn't have said that
when you saved me.

437
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:57,024
Sorry.

438
00:37:58,317 --> 00:38:00,152
Don't worry. I'll take care of this.

439
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:03,364
I'll apologize and compensate
with my own savings.

440
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:06,701
Have faith in Daniel.
There's nothing he can't fix.

441
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:08,286
Really?

442
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:14,959
Oh, my.

443
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,172
My goodness.

444
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:27,054
Here are the walkie-talkies you asked for.

445
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,140
Captain Yoo will know how to work them.

446
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,558
What are these for?

447
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:32,768
It'll be more convenient
than a cellphone here.

448
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:36,647
I'll be worried when your phone
gets disconnected like yesterday.

449
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:43,404
Thank you. How much do we owe you?

450
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,823
-For this?
-No, for the car.

451
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,744
I'll try my best to fix it first.

452
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:51,037
Can you fix it?

453
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:54,582
Even if I do fix it, it won't be the same.

454
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,209
I regret the things I didn't do with it.

455
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:59,462
I didn't even have it painted.

456
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:01,839
Nor had I filled it up with
high-grade gasoline.

457
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:03,257
Cheer up.

458
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:07,845
This might be the last time you see this
walkie-talkie, say some last words to it.

459
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:16,145
The medical team is set on channel seven.

460
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:18,022
Channel three is us.

461
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:23,903
When using it, you need to press
the button here and wait a second.

462
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:30,034
This is Big Boss,
calling for medical team support. Over.

463
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:31,035
Like this.

464
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:32,953
Is Big Boss a nickname?

465
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,039
It's a call sign. Did you pick yours?

466
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:38,959
Not yet. I...

467
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:41,962
-Beauty?
-You must be out of your mind.

468
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,006
-You look similar.
-What?

469
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:46,550
I'm not a beauty,
but I look similar to one?

470
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,303
-From time to time.
-From time to time?

471
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:50,262
Goodness!

472
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:53,891
Oh, my.

473
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:57,311
Could I interrupt your
vacation for a minute?

474
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:02,233
Why did you come here?
Weren't you deployed to headquarters?

475
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,277
I'm here to marry you.

476
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:08,406
Don't even joke about that.

477
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:12,368
Did I make you nervous?

478
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:17,456
I'm officially reporting to you.

479
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:20,251
I, Lieutenant Yoon Myeong-ju,
have been ordered to join

480
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:22,753
Medi Cube of the Mowuru Company
as of 28 May, 2015.

481
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:25,881
I am here to report for duty. Solidarity.

482
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:31,929
I smell abuse of power in this transfer.

483
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:36,016
My life isn't easy, being in conflict
over favorable injustice.

484
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:40,146
I'll leave you to catch up then.

485
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:44,316
You should at least say hello.

486
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:48,821
Let's make this work.
Let bygones be bygones.

487
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:55,703
I don't have any spare hands to shake.
Nor am I willing to forget about the past.

488
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:06,797
I've been curious.

489
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,633
What's up with you and Dr. Kang?

490
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:13,053
Did you happen to meet
Kang Mo-yeon here by coincidence?

491
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:16,515
Or were you seeing her
and reunited here, feigning coincidence?

492
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:18,350
You think I'm like you?

493
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:20,519
And why are you calling her by her name?

494
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:21,812
She's older, your senior.

495
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:24,190
Whose side are you taking?

496
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:27,151
Don't change the subject.
What's with the two of you?

497
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:31,238
I don't think you're a match.
I object to her becoming my sister-in-law.

498
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:33,282
What are you talking about?

499
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:36,619
-I thought you came here to marry me.
-You're right.

500
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:38,746
Anyways.

501
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:08,817
Is the door sick?

502
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:20,538
The commander called to put in
a good word for you.

503
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,123
So are you going to treat me well?

504
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:26,085
It's my aim to give you such a hard time
you decide to leave.

505
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:29,088
We won't even see each other
for that long.

506
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:31,799
I heard your return date has been
moved up.

507
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:33,884
Because of your father's
discharge ceremony.

508
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,512
Did the commander pull some strings?

509
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:39,098
What? You little...

510
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:43,060
It's solicitude.

511
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:47,314
The commander sure loves his son-in-law.

512
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:49,775
You might really
become his son-in-law.

513
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:51,652
So you should be good to me.

514
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:54,321
If it weren't for me,
you would have married me.

515
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:57,324
Maybe I should just marry you.

516
00:42:58,492 --> 00:42:59,743
Are you threatening me?

517
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:04,957
I'm sorry for my slip of the tongue.

518
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:10,129
Oh, right.

519
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:14,216
Have you talked to Master Sergeant Seo
over the phone?

520
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,634
What do you think?

521
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:18,220
He won't answer my calls.

522
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:20,806
He won't answer your calls?

523
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:23,350
He answers my calls just fine.

524
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:27,354
Actually, he's the one
who calls me all the time.

525
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:31,191
-Hello, Master Sergeant Seo.
-Did he pick up?

526
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:34,695
Why aren't you answering?

527
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:37,615
He's not picking up.

528
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:40,284
Do you want to leave a message?

529
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:46,540
I'll give you one minute.

530
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:48,876
Using all the bullets,

531
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:51,837
shoot accurately at the assigned targets.
Begin now.

532
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,005
-Begin now.
-Begin now.

533
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:16,862
There are three absolute orders.

534
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:22,326
The absolute order of attack...

535
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,995
allows only for proceeding forwards.

536
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:29,041
The absolute order of defense...

537
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,043
prohibits retreat.

538
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:34,129
The absolute order to stand by...

539
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:44,098
You have three bullets left.

540
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,370
At the absolute order of stand by...

541
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:09,123
there must be absolutely no movement.

542
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,291
That is what an order is.

543
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:14,878
Orders come before everything
for all soldiers.

544
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:19,466
That is the duty of soldiers
in the Special Forces.

545
00:45:22,928 --> 00:45:24,138
Solidarity.

546
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,057
The commander is looking for you.

547
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:31,478
That is all for today. Dismissed!

548
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:32,563
Dismissed!

549
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:35,983
Is there anyone qualified to be
a part of Alpha Team?

550
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:39,069
I will make a report
after their five-week training is over.

551
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:41,071
The legendary instructor has returned,

552
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:44,116
pick out some officers
who can become good team leaders.

553
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:49,538
Si-jin got himself into trouble.
He'll stop going overseas for missions.

554
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:52,833
I'll give him a position in
the Ministry of Defense to get experience

555
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:55,002
and to make some connections.

556
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:57,963
Yes, sir.

557
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:04,178
Myeong-ju thinks my transfer
order was unreasonable.

558
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:06,138
What do you think?

559
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:09,057
I share Lieutenant Yoon's opinion.

560
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:13,228
I am willing to go into an investigation.

561
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:15,981
-You may report me if you wish.
-That will not happen.

562
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:20,611
I have lost this fight.

563
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:22,446
Is that so?

564
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:25,866
You have a weapon in your hand
that I can't resist against.

565
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:28,118
Your sincere heart.

566
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:32,956
You are sincerely concerned
about Lieutenant Yoon's future

567
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:36,668
and you sincerely do not approve of me.

568
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:39,713
That's why...

569
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:42,883
I share the same thoughts as you, sir.

570
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:45,677
That is why I have lost this fight.

571
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:50,432
I will forfeit this fight
for Lieutenant Yoon's sake.

572
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:05,197
I am writing this letter hoping

573
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,657
you will never get to read it.

574
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:10,828
If you are reading this letter,

575
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,873
that means we have parted once again.

576
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:19,127
And it also means my father has
ordered you to leave again.

577
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:23,841
I am sorry

578
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:27,219
for being the kind of a woman
who stands in the way.

579
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:31,849
But I still sit here and wonder
how you are doing.

580
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:35,727
And you cannot find
an answer to my question.

581
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,273
We are probably far away
from each other again.

582
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:42,401
YOON MYEONG-JU

583
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:44,820
I am sorry...

584
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:48,949
for running to you again knowing
this would happen.

585
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:52,744
Sorry for running into your
arms with all my heart.

586
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:57,541
I'm sorry that I regret

587
00:47:58,166 --> 00:47:59,877
not holding your hands enough...

588
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:02,379
and not hugging you enough.

589
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:07,175
I am sorry that I still love you.

590
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,890
I'll be fine if you do not ever get
to read these words.

591
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:15,893
I just wish we could be together in Uruk.

592
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:18,812
So, what happened to us?

593
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:20,772
Did we get to meet?

594
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:22,649
Or...

595
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:25,152
did we part again?

596
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:35,078
Excuse me.

597
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:38,790
Are you the new army doctor?

598
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:43,545
Are you an intern from Haesung Hospital?

599
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:46,465
I do look very young, don't I?
I'm a first-year resident.

600
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:49,176
Well, I have a question.

601
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:51,345
I have to go to the army very soon.

602
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:53,847
Do army doctors get a gun?

603
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:55,349
Army doctors are soldiers, too.

604
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:56,767
I see.

605
00:48:57,392 --> 00:48:58,685
What if a war breaks out?

606
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,355
Do we not treat the enemy?

607
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:03,106
Army doctors are doctors, too.

608
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:05,859
That's so cool.

609
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:08,946
Are you flirting with me?

610
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:10,364
What?

611
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:12,866
You've misunderstood.

612
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,828
I was just saying
an army doctor's dilemma is very cool.

613
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:20,958
And also, you aren't that pretty.

614
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:22,793
Are you talking about me?

615
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:27,714
My goodness, you have a good eye.

616
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:29,424
I just love you.

617
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:31,343
-Let's go have a meeting.
-Okay.

618
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:33,637
I knew the Haesung Group
would be like this.

619
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:35,389
What are all those?

620
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:37,724
Are you picking a fight,
or asking a question?

621
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:42,020
I'm asking because you'll only be here
for 15 days, but you had to drag all that

622
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:44,731
just to take pictures of yourselves
giving out vaccines.

623
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:48,527
Is it their way of putting together
a fancy lunch box for their kids?

624
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:52,656
Thank you for calling us fancy, but--

625
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:54,157
I was calling you a lunch box.

626
00:49:57,202 --> 00:49:58,662
For your information,

627
00:49:58,745 --> 00:50:01,707
that is Medi Cube,
which is a top-notch field clinic.

628
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:04,584
The reason why we brought it
for our mere 15 days is...

629
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:07,379
because we are going
to donate it to the U.N. afterwards.

630
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:09,089
Do you have a problem with that?

631
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:11,216
Are you picking a fight
or asking a question?

632
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:13,343
Anyway, I'm a bit busy.

633
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:17,681
I hate that snooty girl!

634
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:19,516
She'll hear you.

635
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:23,103
I wanted her to hear. Look at her
walking away pretending not to have heard.

636
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:27,107
I won. Let's go.

637
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:31,153
Are you sure you won?

638
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:34,364
In which aspect did you just win?

639
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:37,909
Make sure you stock up
Bioflor and Entrue at the pharmacy.

640
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:40,704
Today's night duty is Doctor Ha and...

641
00:50:41,663 --> 00:50:43,248
Can someone stand in for me?

642
00:50:43,331 --> 00:50:44,332
No one can.

643
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:47,169
If nobody can do it, I will take it.

644
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:52,049
That's all for today.
Do you have any questions?

645
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:58,388
Why are we holding our meeting here
and not at the Medi Cube?

646
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:02,934
Can someone take that off
and put it in the Medi Cube?

647
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:06,229
-No one can.
-No one can.

648
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:13,487
This is Miss B calling for Beauty. Over.

649
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:15,781
This is actually pretty fun.

650
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:18,575
Beauty reporting. Over.

651
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:21,078
What's for lunch today? Over.

652
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:23,413
I will check and let you know. Over.

653
00:51:25,123 --> 00:51:27,959
I will tell you what's for lunch.
Beauty...

654
00:51:30,837 --> 00:51:32,339
let's have a talk. Over.

655
00:51:33,548 --> 00:51:35,050
Goodbye, Beauty.

656
00:51:35,133 --> 00:51:36,968
-Goodbye.
-Great job today.

657
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:51,274
What do we need to talk about?
Are you allowed to talk to me?

658
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:53,360
Why not?

659
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:56,196
I don't think
your fiancee will be very happy.

660
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:58,240
I have something to say.

661
00:51:58,323 --> 00:51:59,491
I have nothing to hear.

662
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:07,666
Don't you think there is
something going on

663
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:10,544
between Captain Yoo and Mo-yeon?

664
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:11,545
Like what?

665
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:14,005
It's something similar
as the thing between us.

666
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:16,466
What's between us? Regrets?

667
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:17,759
Regrets?

668
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:22,222
I hope you have a hard time cleaning up

669
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:24,057
this huge mess. 

670
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:29,229
My goodness.

671
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:31,356
He's so juvenile.

672
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:36,820
Just shut it down.
You can no longer drive that car.

673
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:39,114
You are not allowed to
pronounce it dead yet.

674
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:40,574
That is for doctors to do.

675
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:45,996
You really do look like

676
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:48,123
the owner of a hardware store.

677
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:50,167
I really am the owner of a hardware store.

678
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:54,421
I find you sexier when you hold
a surgical knife

679
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:57,299
instead of a wrench, Daniel.

680
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:03,013
You know what? Only Asians say that.

681
00:53:03,805 --> 00:53:07,142
Westerners love a man in overalls
holding a wrench.

682
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:11,563
You're such a naughty man!

683
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:26,036
The door. Give me the door.

684
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:36,880
This is Mr. Handsome.

685
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:39,174
Come in, Headquarters!

686
00:53:39,257 --> 00:53:41,927
Roger, this is Headquarters!
What is going on?

687
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:46,223
It looks bad here.

688
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:48,725
We need liquid patch.

689
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:53,146
Stay calm and hold out
just a little longer!

690
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:59,611
-I'll get it to you before it's too late!
-Okay, I will hold on until the end!

691
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:02,447
Here it is!

692
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:09,162
Clear.

693
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:15,835
This is Chicken Lover.
Come in, Beauty.

694
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:20,882
We need a show to boost
the morale of our troops. Over!

695
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:24,803
All right. Over.

696
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:32,269
I am the singer Beauty,
who just finished the Southeast Asia tour.

697
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:38,316
Under the blue sky

698
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:42,070
The mountains bloom and the rivers roar

699
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:46,449
The sun is rising once again

700
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:49,869
On the land of prosperity

701
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:53,581
You and I have sacrificed

702
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:57,294
Our youth to this nation

703
00:54:57,794 --> 00:55:01,423
If this is a journey

704
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:05,135
For the sake of freedom and peace

705
00:55:05,218 --> 00:55:07,012
We will gladly

706
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:08,722
Give up our youth

707
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:12,100
We will devote our lives

708
00:55:27,198 --> 00:55:28,325
Thank you.

709
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:29,617
There you are.

710
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:31,411
Hello, come here.

711
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,293
Cake? Is someone's birthday today?

712
00:55:38,376 --> 00:55:39,669
Please sit here.

713
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:41,379
We were about to go get you.

714
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:42,714
It is a farewell party.

715
00:55:42,797 --> 00:55:44,799
Who is the farewell party for?

716
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:47,177
For the Company Commander.

717
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:48,678
Company Commander?

718
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:52,932
You mean Captain Yoo?

719
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:53,850
Yes.

720
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:56,353
His deployment term ended,
he'll leave tomorrow.

721
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:05,028
How could he do this to me
without saying a word?

722
00:56:05,111 --> 00:56:07,489
I don't understand him.

723
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:10,617
How could he do this?

724
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:22,128
Shift changed at 20:30
for the ammunition storage.

725
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:23,421
Will continue working.

726
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:25,256
Copy that.

727
00:56:31,971 --> 00:56:34,849
Si-jin, what kind of a person are you?
How could you...

728
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:37,519
How could you say nothing?

729
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:39,479
-Big Boss, copy that.
-My goodness!

730
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:42,690
If anyone sees Dr. Kang, report to me.

731
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:50,198
I am here, what is it?

732
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:51,908
Doctor Kang?

733
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:54,786
Why are you listening in on
a military channel?

734
00:56:55,286 --> 00:56:56,329
Are you a spy?

735
00:56:57,497 --> 00:56:58,415
I'll come see you.

736
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:00,291
Where is "here"?

737
00:57:04,295 --> 00:57:05,755
I'm going back home tomorrow.

738
00:57:07,048 --> 00:57:08,550
I heard that you already know.

739
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:10,552
Right.

740
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:16,641
I was the last to know
out of everyone in this camp.

741
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:19,811
I tried to tell you yesterday afternoon,

742
00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:21,688
but you ran away from me.

743
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:22,856
Remember that?

744
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:25,650
You should've run after me.

745
00:57:26,192 --> 00:57:29,070
If you can save Private Ryan,
you could've caught me.

746
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:31,197
I am not so sure,

747
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:35,702
but you being angry at me seems to give
me the upper hand.

748
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:38,621
-Am I right?
-You are wrong.

749
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:47,422
Is your mind still conflicted?

750
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:57,182
I see.

751
00:57:59,058 --> 00:58:00,560
Then let me ask you one thing,

752
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:02,812
since this might be the last time.

753
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,276
It's about that kiss.

754
00:58:08,693 --> 00:58:11,654
-I told you not to bring that up until I--
-What should I do?

755
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:15,825
Should I apologize?

756
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:19,204
Or confess my love?

757
00:59:05,166 --> 00:59:06,960
I drank with Dr. Kang.

758
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:08,795
Is it going well?

759
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:10,421
What can I do? I miss you.

760
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:12,048
When do you get off?

761
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:13,258
Can I ask you something?

762
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:15,510
Do you like Si-jin?

763
00:59:15,593 --> 00:59:17,095
Where is Captain Yoo?

764
00:59:17,178 --> 00:59:19,681
He left last night.

765
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:23,142
A strong earthquake of
magnitude 6.7 broke out.

766
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:24,310
Hey, stay low!

767
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:25,770
The power plant is down!

768
00:59:25,853 --> 00:59:29,524
The entire medical team is
still unaccounted for!

769
00:59:29,607 --> 00:59:31,025
And now I just resent you.

770
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:32,819
I can't even beg for you to stay.

771
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:34,571
This is Captain Yoo Si-jin.

772
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:37,365
Put on anyone who knows about
the situation at Mowuru.

773
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:39,367
Do not hang up. Do it now.

774
00:59:40,201 --> 00:59:42,412
