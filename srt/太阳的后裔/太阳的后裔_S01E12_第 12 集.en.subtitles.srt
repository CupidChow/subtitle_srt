1
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:29,279
Is there something going on, sir?

2
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,908
Yes, something bad.

3
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:17,827
EPISODE 12

4
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,353
I am okay now.

5
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:45,188
The treatment is working.

6
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:47,607
That's a relief.

7
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:53,822
But why are you wearing these clothes?

8
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,367
Are you going somewhere?

9
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:02,789
Right now we have completely
lost contact with Dr. Kang and Big Boss.

10
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:07,085
Dr. Kang can't be reached
and we think she has been kidnapped,

11
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:10,255
while Big Boss, who isn't taking calls...

12
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,466
seems to have started a one-man operation.

13
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:18,680
-So now...
-You said my gift was on the way...

14
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,349
Can I open that gift now?

15
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:58,094
Keep this close to you.

16
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:01,472
If you lose this,
you know I have to pay to get another.

17
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:09,189
You know you have to come back, right?

18
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:19,157
Starting now, we're beginning
an unauthorized black ops mission.

19
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,327
We expect an armed clash
with armed gang members,

20
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,078
and we have no backup.

21
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:26,789
This is an out-of-uniform mission,

22
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:28,958
and we may not come back alive.

23
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,878
If you don't want to take part,
you are excused.

24
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,631
-Any questions?
-No, sir.

25
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:38,468
Good. Break time is over.

26
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:43,973
From this moment,
everyone is back on the Alpha Team.

27
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,329
Take care of the kids.

28
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:51,953
What are you doing here?

29
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:55,123
What are you doing,
standing here alone with your hands up?

30
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,042
I got all scared thinking I was all alone,

31
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:01,504
but then I welcomed you with open arms.

32
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:02,839
No need to be scared.

33
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,633
All members of the Alpha Team
have come back from leave.

34
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,638
I will thank everyone properly
once we get back.

35
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,601
Captain Big Boss here,
I am giving you my operation orders.

36
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:21,232
Piccolo, Harry Potter,
keep the children safe,

37
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:22,900
and get them out of here quickly.

38
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,318
Yes, sir.

39
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:30,658
Wolf and Snoopy will be
on the hostage rescue mission with me.

40
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:32,285
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

41
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:34,620
What?

42
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:37,415
Who started what mission?

43
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:41,711
At 20:20 our time, the Republic of Korea's
Special Forces team is

44
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,046
on an unofficial black ops mission--

45
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,339
Lieutenant General Yoon!

46
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,884
With whose permission...

47
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,928
This is driving me nuts.

48
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:55,308
The U.S. Army has promised to rescue
the hostage within 24 hours.

49
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,686
The Korean army went to rescue
a Korean national.

50
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:00,480
There's no reason to not understand.

51
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:03,691
This isn't just a simple
civilian hostage situation.

52
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:07,153
What if our military gets involved
and ruins the CIA operation?

53
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,906
Who will be responsible for that?

54
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,658
I am fully aware of
the diplomatic stance--

55
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,368
Stop interrupting me.

56
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:18,706
This is a national security matter
that has to be  handled delicately

57
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:20,583
in a political and diplomatic way.

58
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:24,629
So let's just leave the hostage rescue
operation to the U.S. Army,

59
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:28,508
while we maintain our security
and control the press--

60
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:31,344
Hey, you. Mister politician, over there.

61
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,517
What did you just say?

62
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,895
I misheard, didn't I?

63
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:44,315
If you heard it wrong,
listen carefully one more time.

64
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,902
To you people, maybe national security

65
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,364
means governing from a secret room
and the diplomatic verbiage you say

66
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:53,032
in front of a camera,

67
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:57,745
but to my teams, it's a country
they dedicate their youth to protecting

68
00:08:57,828 --> 00:09:01,082
and a duty and order they carry out
by putting their lives on the line!

69
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:05,419
The reason they answer the call,
without recognition or honor,

70
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:10,466
even when they get captured
or killed during a mission is because

71
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:15,137
they firmly believe a Korean national's
life is a matter of national security.

72
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:21,727
As the Chief Commander, I will take
full responsibility from this moment on,

73
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:25,106
so you can carefully
pick out a tie to wear,

74
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:28,150
gather up the reporters,
and engage in politics elegantly.

75
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:30,695
Seriously.

76
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,115
You know that you
taking responsibility means

77
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:37,994
you can forget about your uniform, right?

78
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:43,082
If it's honorable, I'd do that anytime.

79
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,051
Ye-hwa prepared this medicine.

80
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,095
She said it will help you recover.

81
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:58,306
She said to drink it down in one go.

82
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,564
I'm making too many people worry.

83
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:16,782
I know this is not something to discuss
with someone who nearly died, but...

84
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:21,162
did something really happen
to Team Leader Kang?

85
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:23,205
Have you heard
from Sergeant First Class Seo?

86
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,291
Was Dr. Kang really kidnapped?

87
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,877
Did Captain Yoo and the others
go to rescue Dr. Kang?

88
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,254
Please do not worry.

89
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:34,592
He will definitely rescue her...
using the necessary method.

90
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:37,887
What method?

91
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:40,931
You don't want to know.

92
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,476
I think he's still inside the building.

93
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:26,811
Let's move quickly.

94
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:29,897
Start the mission.

95
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,949
All snipers on standby.

96
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,911
Wolf transmitting. I got his location.

97
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:35,254
Hold. Hold! All snipers hold your fire!

98
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:43,179
Snoopy, do you recognize
the bomb type attached to the hostage?

99
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:46,056
From the looks of it,
it looks like a timed bomb vest.

100
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:49,518
As soon as he let's go of the detonator,
the bomb will go off.

101
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,562
How about just cutting off his wrist...

102
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:54,857
Please hold! If you shoot the target,
the vest will explode.

103
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,735
-Is there no other way?
-I will come over there now.

104
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:46,534
There's a wireless transmitter connected
to the detonator, so buy us more time.

105
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:31,161
The trigger is on her left shoulder.

106
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:35,708
A faint green light on the shoulder
to the right. I am sure of it.

107
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,013
I'm sorry for being late.

108
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:54,518
Don't move. Just stay where you are.

109
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,564
You trust me, don't you?

110
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,860
Be sure not to move.

111
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:10,784
Take aim.

112
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:58,707
-How much time is left?
-I can disarm it in one minute.

113
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,709
Just don't move.

114
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:02,670
It's not that I'm moving.

115
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,713
I'm trying not to move, but...

116
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,091
Look at me. Look me in the eyes.

117
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:13,722
Do you remember when I pulled the prank
with the landmine?

118
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:17,893
You told me to get a professional then.

119
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,897
I've been in the military for 15 years,
including the academy,

120
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:25,484
and I've never seen a bomb
Staff Sergeant Choi could not disarm.

121
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,444
He is the best in our army.

122
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,365
So don't worry.

123
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,201
You definitely won't die.

124
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:40,499
But still...
there are only 30 seconds left.

125
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,501
You two should go. Hurry!

126
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,338
You have no idea what
we can do in 30 seconds.

127
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:52,094
-I am done. I will take it off of her.
-See?

128
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:57,599
I've removed the vest,
but I couldn't to stop the timer.

129
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,226
It's going to explode.

130
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,811
Take cover!

131
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:12,156
Big Boss, to your left!

132
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,562
Forget about this.

133
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,613
Call from Korea, Captain.

134
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:39,493
Solidarity. Captain Yoo Si-jin.

135
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,913
Mission completed. I'm on my way back.

136
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:47,251
The target has been shot,
and the hostage is safe.

137
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,923
I will disconnect the radio
and be on standby.

138
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:56,969
I will accept any necessary
disciplinary action.

139
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:00,264
You worked hard to carry out the mission.

140
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:04,476
There won't be a reward for your efforts,
but there will be no disciplinary action.

141
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,355
-That will be your reward.
-Lieutenant General Yoon!

142
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:11,066
Don't worry about anything, get some rest.
That is all.

143
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:15,070
What a real screwed up unit.

144
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:22,452
Can we put it in the minutes
that this mission was ordered by you?

145
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,122
It would be my pleasure.

146
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:32,337
A lot of problems will arise but the issue
of who's responsible will be resolved.

147
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:36,049
The Blue House has been briefed already.

148
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:39,469
Let's decide on the level of discipline
under diplomatic rapport--

149
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,723
The President is here.

150
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:44,099
-Right now?
-Yes.

151
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,142
-Here?
-Yes.

152
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:53,483
I've already been briefed on the way here.
Please sit.

153
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:57,738
I heard the hostage is now safe.

154
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:01,491
Yes, but the CIA

155
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:05,454
is strongly protesting the solo mission
that was carried out.

156
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:09,458
We have been put in an
awkward diplomatic situation.

157
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,960
This will be a burden
to trade negotiations.

158
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:15,672
Before this becomes
a burden on an administrative level,

159
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:20,093
you must strongly penalize the person
who gave the order for this mission.

160
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,138
Should I?

161
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:29,144
I am Special Forces Commander,
Lieutenant General Yoon Gil-joon.

162
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,438
I am in agreement.

163
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:35,567
I will take all of the responsibility.

164
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:37,236
I think differently.

165
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,323
Why should you take responsibility

166
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:44,117
for a successfully completed
hostage rescue mission?

167
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:49,206
The hostage is safe and the problem
is about politics and diplomacy.

168
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,376
That's my responsibility.

169
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:55,003
I will take all of the responsibility.

170
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,215
But, Mr. President--

171
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:00,801
Please investigate and report
any expected issues

172
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:02,761
to the foreign security affairs team.

173
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:11,687
Thank you for saving our citizen.

174
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:18,193
And thank you
for getting everyone back uninjured.

175
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:08,762
This is my first time
seeing a gunshot wound.

176
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:12,057
Coming here, out into this big wide world,
I'm seeing all kinds of things.

177
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:15,143
-I think you'll need a few stitches.
-Right.

178
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,480
Bite down on this,
and get a bottle of vodka.

179
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:21,358
Your homeland
will remember your sacrifice.

180
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:24,236
Why?

181
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:26,988
This is how a gunshot wound
is taken care of.

182
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:27,989
Haven't you watched movies?

183
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:32,077
In a horror movie, you know that noisy
doctors like you die first?

184
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,078
You bite the pen.

185
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,294
You've gone through a lot.

186
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:44,423
I was worried about you.

187
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,466
What do I do?

188
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,635
-Make her bite on to it first.
-Hey!

189
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:57,727
One! Two! Three! Four!

190
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:01,356
One, two, three, four.

191
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,526
One, two, three, four.

192
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:08,613
While running, you will sing an army song!
The army song is "A cool man!"

193
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,157
-A cool!
-A cool!

194
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,741
-Man!
-Man!

195
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:14,661
There are so many!

196
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:21,084
He's so tall!

197
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:23,712
Sergeant First Class Seo!

198
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,965
Can you come see me for a bit?

199
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,261
Yes.

200
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:36,683
After watching and enduring it many times,
I am saying this as an intellectual.

201
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:40,020
Why do you have to do those
obscene things every day?

202
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:41,813
It's so harmful, seriously!

203
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:50,113
Sergeant First Class Seo.

204
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,324
Sergeant First Class Seo!

205
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:21,436
How's your wound?

206
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:26,816
I couldn't ask you yesterday,
I wasn't thinking straight. How is Fatima?

207
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:28,818
She's okay.

208
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,656
She's being treated at
the headquarters emergency center.

209
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:35,033
They say she looks good.

210
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:37,702
Is that true?

211
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:39,704
What do you mean?

212
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:42,374
You seem to lie to me often.

213
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:49,172
You told me you sent the Phantom Village
kids to a safe place.

214
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,217
But those children were all there.

215
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:58,515
I'm sorry for lying.

216
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,102
I did it in case you were worried.

217
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:09,526
So what other lies did you tell me
in case I was worried?

218
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:15,490
How did you get this?

219
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,243
While shoveling at the unit.

220
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:21,121
Are you okay? Did anyone get hurt?

221
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:22,831
It was just a car accident.

222
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,624
Everyone must have been surprised.

223
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,251
Can I ask what happened?

224
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,462
Something came up,
I have to go to headquarters.

225
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:32,757
There are...

226
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:36,595
no other lies.

227
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:40,640
Liar.

228
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:48,315
Why have you just old me another lie?

229
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:53,445
I finally understand it now.

230
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,323
The lies you tell

231
00:26:57,365 --> 00:27:00,744
are not lies that I can challenge,
fight with you about,

232
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:02,829
or use to whine about breaking up.

233
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:08,501
Someone's life depends on
the lies you tell.

234
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:13,173
Politics and diplomacy get involved,
and the country takes action.

235
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:20,347
And your jokes were made
to hide those unspeakable things.

236
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:27,687
In the future, you will continue to joke
in order to hide those unspeakable things,

237
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:29,814
and I won't be able to believe them.

238
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:34,444
In the end we won't have anything
to talk about.

239
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:41,910
I just want to talk about

240
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:45,538
how I got mad in the morning
because of someone's crappy parking job,

241
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:49,376
or how I couldn't decide between
kimchi stew and bean paste stew for lunch,

242
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:54,047
or how I got frustrated because
I didn't get my delivery on time.

243
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:57,759
I just want to talk about
those little things...

244
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,263
Then talk about them.

245
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,976
Every word you say is important to me.

246
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:10,980
I know.

247
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,442
I believe you, 

248
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:16,695
but...

249
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:22,117
I can't say those things to a person

250
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:26,371
who blocks a bullet with his body.

251
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:37,799
Do you want to break up with me?

252
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:47,767
I'm considering whether or not...

253
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,438
I can handle you.

254
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:07,407
The patients will leave two days before
the medical team on Wednesday.

255
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,534
We will be taking the Friday night flight.

256
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:12,287
So, the Haesung Hospital Volunteer team

257
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:15,206
officially disbands on Thursday.

258
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,751
We're really going.

259
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:21,212
Be honest. Are we fired or disbanded?

260
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:22,630
Why? Are you sad?

261
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,674
You were the one
who wanted to go so badly.

262
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:27,385
That's true,
but I'm not super excited about this.

263
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:28,386
Am I the only one?

264
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:32,932
Me, too. I feel weird.

265
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:36,311
Me, too.  Well...

266
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:41,691
Then should we go?

267
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,444
This is our last round in Uruk.

268
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:58,791
First Lieutenant Yoon,
you are indeed a soldier.

269
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,335
How are you recovering so fast?

270
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:02,962
Why are you asking how?
It's because I'm young.

271
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:05,840
Hearing you talk, you're recovered.

272
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:09,510
After two days of being stable,
you can be discharged.

273
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:14,432
I understand. Please stand still.

274
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:16,392
Who is treating whom right now?

275
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,478
What are you doing?

276
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,480
Are you taking your medicine?

277
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:22,690
Change the dressing
so it doesn't get infected.

278
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,692
You can shower after two days.

279
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:26,986
You can be discharged.

280
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:36,621
Starting tomorrow, please prepare porridge
for his meals and adjust his antibiotics.

281
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,249
You have passed the critical stage.

282
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:43,002
But because of you,
many people almost died.

283
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:45,838
You will be summoned in South Korea,

284
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:48,549
so I hope you get
the punishment you deserve.

285
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:52,345
Diamonds... My diamonds...

286
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:57,308
Your diamonds have been turned over
to the U.S., you won't get them back.

287
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:00,186
I'm letting you know so you suffer.

288
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,155
You don't hurt anywhere?

289
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:15,201
You're the healthiest patient
that will return to Korea.

290
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:18,830
If I go back to Korea,
it'll be cold, right?

291
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:21,332
I don't like the cold.

292
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:25,169
Doctor! Doctor!

293
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:27,505
This fax just arrived.

294
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:29,674
It says something about Dr. Lee Chi-hoon.

295
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:31,342
The results must be back.

296
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:35,054
Wait! Can you give that to me?

297
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:45,690
You shouldn't be in here.

298
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:47,567
We're all returning to Korea.

299
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:49,444
Doctors and patients, everyone.

300
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,572
Good for you, you won't see me anymore.

301
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:00,288
I didn't get it.

302
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,292
I didn't get it! I'm not dying!

303
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:07,003
You're glad that you're not dying?

304
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:16,804
Me, too.

305
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:21,642
I'm glad that you're not dying, Doctor!

306
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:29,233
-Thank you.
-Don't say thank you.

307
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:32,278
You don't have to say sorry, either
because I won't say it.

308
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,555
Ah, you scared me!

309
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:03,559
When did you get here?

310
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,104
Did you walk here alone again?

311
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,608
You're all better.

312
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,361
I'm not sick anymore. I'm all better.

313
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:17,365
Ah, wait here for moment!
I have something for you.

314
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:23,913
When you grow big, wear them.
I'm giving them to you.

315
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:26,124
And when you need money, sell them.

316
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,877
There are less than
50 pairs of these in the world.

317
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,546
Not this.

318
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:32,672
A goat...

319
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:34,549
I know, kid!

320
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,551
I will miss you, too. But...

321
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:38,761
Blakey is the name of the village.

322
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:41,430
-What is your real name?
-Buy me a goat.

323
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:44,475
Not this. I want to raise a goat.

324
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:47,270
Oh, Chwadi!

325
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:51,607
-That's your name.
-Yes, a goat.

326
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:54,026
Buy me a goat.

327
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:56,988
-I want to raise a goat.
-Okay.

328
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:00,825
I know how you feel.
I'm also happy that I met you, kid!

329
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:04,912
I will miss you a lot.

330
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:10,668
Don't think about repaying me.

331
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:15,548
Just think about yourself, okay?

332
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:41,824
Do you want to break up with me?

333
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:09,352
Let's take one together.

334
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:17,068
Kimchi. One, two three...

335
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,184
You, too,

336
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:35,187
should forget this.

337
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,232
Do you want to have some coffee with me?

338
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:25,780
Please make the coffee, Captain.

339
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:27,740
I'll be at the cloister.

340
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:31,095
Before you arrive
I did my rounds at the Medi Cube.

341
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:36,767
I was happy about
First Lieutenant Yoon's speedy recovery.

342
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:41,897
But when I was going to put my hair up,
there was no hair tie available.

343
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:45,568
Even though I searched all over the place,
I couldn't find any.

344
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:49,822
Hair ties aren't significant.

345
00:40:57,663 --> 00:40:58,998
Starting from now on,

346
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:02,376
I am going to tell you
all the trivial stuff too.

347
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:07,798
What I mean is, I will try my best
to deal with the way you are.

348
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,925
So you should also

349
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,137
try your best to deal with my chattiness.

350
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:19,143
But please promise me one thing in return.

351
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,982
Please give me the right
to be insecure.

352
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:32,573
I can't be constantly insecure
when you're not there.

353
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:38,704
So when do something that should
really make me worry,

354
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:39,997
then let me know.

355
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:42,583
For example,

356
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:45,586
if you tell me that you're going
to the department store,

357
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:49,340
then I'll understand
that you're going on a difficult mission.

358
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:53,969
When you're going to be
in a life or death situation,

359
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:57,515
don't make me laugh
and act oblivious.

360
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:09,151
I will ask you one last question.

361
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:14,031
Is it me or the homeland?

362
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:19,620
You have to give me a good answer
as this will be the only time I ask.

363
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:22,873
It's Kang Mo-yeon for now.

364
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,167
For now?

365
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:28,170
You said that you will
only ask me this once.

366
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:31,131
But that was before hearing,
"It's Kang Mo-yeon for now."

367
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:34,468
-What will you do if I ask you twice?
-It will still be Kang Mo-yeon.

368
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:36,762
Really?

369
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:39,974
What about the homeland?

370
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:44,728
The homeland doesn't get jealous.
It just trusts me.

371
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:48,274
Why do I have to be in this kind of love?

372
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:50,359
What kind of man has the homeland
as a mother-in-law

373
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:51,694
and the nation as a sister?

374
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:06,083
What you are worried about
will never happen, Dr. Kang.

375
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:09,253
I will promise you that.

376
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:14,758
I don't know.

377
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:20,598
You are so pretty.

378
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:21,932
I already knew that.

379
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:42,453
I am fine now.

380
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:46,457
The fever has gone down,
and I'm super hungry right now.

381
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,085
I want some chicken stew with ginseng.

382
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:52,463
-Chicken stew with ginseng?
-And some pork belly.

383
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:55,257
We can go eat that once we get to Korea.

384
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:57,468
I also want a beer-soju cocktail.

385
00:43:57,551 --> 00:43:59,803
If you want booze,
you must be feeling better.

386
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:04,308
I'm realizing that all the things
I like remind me of you.

387
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,436
Chicken stew with ginseng, pork belly,

388
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:10,022
beer-soju cocktail, and Seo Dae-young.

389
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:14,943
That's so fascinating. The word
"fascinating" also makes me think of you.

390
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:16,570
You liar.

391
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:35,547
I love you.

392
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:46,183
Ah, seriously!  Commander, sir...

393
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:49,895
You put a soy sauce lid inside, sir!

394
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:51,730
Oh, these weren't dates?

395
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:53,273
That's not edible!

396
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:56,068
-Even when you cook it?
-Pardon?

397
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:58,570
Put this in there.
When it's cooked, it's very tasty.

398
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:01,073
Tasty, indeed.
You know what you're talking about.

399
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:02,491
For goodness sake!

400
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:04,785
Can the two of you get out of here,
please?

401
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:08,038
It's all about the hard-working hands
and the sincerity that goes in to it.

402
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:11,291
-You just need to put this in to boil?
-That's right. That's right.

403
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:12,710
Salt!

404
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:15,587
Yes! That's right!

405
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:23,387
There you go.

406
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:26,223
Wow. I'm touched.

407
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:28,475
You look really good in those aprons, too.

408
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:32,688
Well, I am the type that likes to
make promises for the future.

409
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:36,316
You two have used all your energy,
so we made this to regain your strength.

410
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,651
I'm not sure if it's good.

411
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:40,696
This is really delicious!
The seasoning is perfect too!

412
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:43,866
-This is definitely Private Kim's work.
-Isn't that right?

413
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:46,368
I will miss his cooking
when I go back to Korea.

414
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:48,120
When I was receiving training,

415
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:50,497
I used to go to this shop
in front of my school.

416
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:54,543
That's so true. I did see you
and Min Yoon-gi eating there together.

417
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:55,794
I didn't go with him.

418
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:58,547
He followed me
because he had something to tell me.

419
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:01,008
You still think
I hindered your relationship--

420
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:03,552
What did he need to talk about anyway?

421
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:07,848
-He said you two weren't a couple.
-He said we weren't a couple?

422
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:10,267
Yes. He said that you were only
study partners.

423
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:11,351
Just study partners?

424
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:14,938
We weren't just study partners.
We had a thing since April!

425
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:17,274
He asked me to go eat with him
back in March.

426
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:20,068
I'm talking about April the year before!

427
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:21,570
Wasn't it just one-sided love?

428
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:22,905
We had a thing!

429
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:34,124
It seems they were on bad terms
because of this Yoon-gi.

430
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:36,752
I won't be able to sleep,
I want to see this Yoon-gi guy.

431
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:39,171
-There's a misunderstanding.
-She's right.

432
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:44,301
They made a fuss about a picture of us,
and they had another relationship.

433
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:45,844
I am heated up right now.

434
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:49,681
I feel like killing whoever this guy is.
He was messing with these girls.

435
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:55,020
I'm thinking he is a doctor somewhere.

436
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:58,190
We should get him
and go all special ops FEO on him.

437
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:05,489
I don't know if I'll be able
to hold myself back when I see him.

438
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:09,243
Snipping will be too clean
and an explosion will be too boring.

439
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:17,584
How embarrassing is this?

440
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:19,670
Who was the one
who started talking about it?

441
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:21,880
Why did you bring him
into this conversation?

442
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:23,924
Now is not the time to fight about that.

443
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:26,093
How are we going to clean up this mess?

444
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:30,013
Can't we shut up about the past
while eating this chicken stew?

445
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:33,600
Don't worry about me.
Worry about yourself.

446
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:35,936
Why should I?

447
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:38,438
All I have to do
is pretend to be really sick.

448
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:42,109
I was brought back to life,
this isn't such a big deal.

449
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:44,278
Darn, I envy you.

450
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:56,540
I am okay.
I think I have a little fever, that's all.

451
00:47:56,832 --> 00:48:01,044
So hot! I think you'll be worried.
I am really okay, though.

452
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:02,796
You look fine to me.

453
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:05,924
You must have been thinking too much
about that Yoon-gi dude.

454
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:07,676
You're blushing.

455
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:10,721
You're not buying it.

456
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:13,015
Hey, I have something to discuss.

457
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:17,853
With me? Ah...

458
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:21,857
So you had a thing going on with Yoon-gi,
but you just want to talk with me?

459
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:23,859
-Can't I?
-You think I'd allow that?

460
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:28,405
Fine then. Speaking of Yoon-gi,
I should call him to hear his voice.

461
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:30,616
Call him. See what happens.

462
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:32,951
I should call him, just out of curiosity.

463
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:42,794
From now on, listen very carefully.

464
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:44,463
What are you going to say?

465
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:49,968
As of now, I like Yoo Si-jin the most
out of all the men in this world.

466
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:54,848
I wrecked three cars with him
and almost drowned,

467
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:57,100
we overcame
an infectious disease together,

468
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:59,436
and I got a bullet wound from his gun.

469
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:02,230
Despite all that,

470
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:04,900
Yoo Si-jin is the one I like so damn much.

471
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:10,072
It's because he is never a coward,

472
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:12,908
and is honorable in every moment,

473
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:15,285
and is handsome every time I see him.

474
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:18,872
Do you have any objections?

475
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:21,166
No, I do not.

476
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:26,129
Then I have something to discuss.
Do you want to hear it or not?

477
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:32,469
Honestly, I've wanted to hear it
from the moment I was born.

478
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:37,516
-I am going to go see Fatima tomorrow.
-Okay.

479
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:39,977
So I was wondering if there was a chance

480
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:42,521
that Daniel and Ye-hwa
could be Fatima's guardians.

481
00:49:42,604 --> 00:49:47,025
Those two people always show up
and then disappear suddenly.

482
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:49,903
Other than them, there is...

483
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:53,115
only one person we can trust.

484
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:55,283
Although, you might not be too happy.

485
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:12,968
Wow, look at her.

486
00:50:51,631 --> 00:50:53,091
Ah, this kid, seriously.

487
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:56,136
Hey, do I have to beg
when I am the one who is paying?

488
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:58,221
Can't you treat me a little nicer?

489
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:11,026
You really have the potential to be great.

490
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:54,069
What is the first thing
you want to do when you go back to Korea?

491
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:58,406
I want to fill the bathtub with hot water
and jump in.

492
00:51:58,490 --> 00:51:59,533
How about you, Captain?

493
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:01,618
I want to watch you do that.

494
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:08,917
Let's watch a movie.
The movie we couldn't watch.

495
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:13,130
It is really hard
to watch a movie together.

496
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:15,799
I'd like that.

497
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:18,385
When we get back to Korea,
let's not get kidnapped, crash a car,

498
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:21,221
or rescue someone,
let's just do things normal people do.

499
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:25,308
Watch a movie, eat, drink tea,
and then take me back home.

500
00:52:25,767 --> 00:52:27,185
And fill up that bathtub?

501
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:31,231
Stay there.

502
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:34,901
You go back first. I will be there soon.

503
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:37,988
Don't go to the hotel with the chairman.

504
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:40,490
Don't cheat on me with that Yoon-gi dude.

505
00:52:41,449 --> 00:52:42,784
I told you to stop.

506
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:43,952
And this...

507
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:54,462
You were still holding on to this?

508
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:59,426
People of Uruk believe that if they take
a pebble from this beach,

509
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:02,304
they will be able to come back
no matter what.

510
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:06,683
Here.

511
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:14,858
Try it this time, Dr. Kang,

512
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:17,277
and see whether you come back.

513
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:34,502
You've worked hard all this time.

514
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:38,506
You, too, Captain.

515
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:21,007
Everyone woke up early today.

516
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:23,760
Because I didn't want to miss
even a second.

517
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:26,346
Stay safe, my doves.

518
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:32,352
Oh, but there is a person
that we haven't seen before.

519
00:54:32,894 --> 00:54:35,605
-Who is it?
-Right? Way in the front.

520
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:38,275
He is quite different.

521
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:45,448
-What?!
-No way.

522
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:59,087
He used to hate it so much.

523
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:02,090
I guess
it is a special event for you, Nurse.

524
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:05,802
Dr. Song is such a good guy.

525
00:55:08,888 --> 00:55:11,474
Can't you two just go out?

526
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:15,270
I will go back in first.
I haven't packed everything yet.

527
00:55:16,604 --> 00:55:17,939
What should I do?

528
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:21,109
I think I made a mistake again.

529
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:23,111
You didn't do anything wrong.

530
00:55:23,194 --> 00:55:25,989
It's because Nurse Ha
is as good of a person as Dr. Song.

531
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:28,199
Like a middle-aged version
of Candy, Candy.

532
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:30,076
What do you mean by that?

533
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:32,954
You're too young to get it.

534
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:40,378
Let's go now.

535
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:41,504
Yes.

536
00:56:46,444 --> 00:56:48,446
One, two, three.

537
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:52,659
Unit, attention!

538
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:55,495
Salute.

539
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:08,842
What a nice morning!

540
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:10,802
Good morning.

541
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:13,471
I work is too far
to travel back and forward to.

542
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:16,266
I liked it when the Medi Cube
was right outside my dorm.

543
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:18,810
And we appreciated the
"doves" every morning.

544
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:20,186
Let's go together.

545
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:21,771
Hello.

546
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:25,358
Doesn't today feel like
our first day of work?

547
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:27,193
I know, right? For me, too.

548
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:30,738
I feel the same too.  It is cold!

549
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:33,032
Good morning.

550
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:36,286
We're really back.

551
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:07,150
What is this mess?

552
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:08,943
When did these men get here?

553
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:12,197
Sofa, here!

554
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:14,866
Are you taking me home?

555
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:16,409
Maybe I won't.

556
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:20,788
Our unit will be guarding the perimeter
of the conference site on the 17th floor.

557
00:58:20,872 --> 00:58:22,290
How can you do this to me?

558
00:58:22,373 --> 00:58:24,542
How can you let me find out this way? How?

559
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:27,212
Me running away every time
spoke for itself.

560
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:28,671
Let's stop.

561
00:58:29,547 --> 00:58:33,134
Who is the guy that had a shootout
in the middle of Seoul?

562
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:36,221
Combat shooting in progress!
We need backup! Backup!

563
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:39,098
I love you very much, Yoon Myeong-ju.

564
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:44,187
