Young Master.

How's it?

16
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,319
I found Miss Xu.

17
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,760
Miss Xu,

18
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,560
I don't care what methods you use.

19
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,079
Within three days,

20
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:36,920
you must pay 2,000 silver coins.

21
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:39,159
Otherwise,

22
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,280
I'll expose you

23
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,719
to murder someone

24
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:43,599
to the whole world.

25
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:48,519
Sure?

26
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:49,600
It's 3,000 silver coins?

27
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:51,120
Dare you take our Mansion

28
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,239
for a treasury?

29
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,400
Fine.

30
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,319
Since you refuse to cooperate,

31
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,959
just wait

32
00:01:58,599 --> 00:01:59,359
to be disgraced.

33
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,719
Don't forget,

34
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,760
we are in the same boat now.

35
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,080
You're involved in that lowlife's death.

36
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,199
Remember.

37
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,479
She

38
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:14,879
was killed by you.

39
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:24,439
It's him.

40
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,080
That actress

41
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,319
was Shen Muling's closest junior.

42
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,800
If this gets out,

43
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,759
we'll both be in trouble.

44
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,719
If I go down,

45
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,319
you won't get away unscathed either.

46
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,199
Think carefully.

47
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:54,520
Kang Shao.

48
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:55,439
Exactly.

49
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,039
He's the one who said

50
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:58,919
the mastermind was your father.

51
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:14,759
Move.

52
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,680
Let me go!

53
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,400
So it's you, Miss Shen.

54
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:40,120
We meet again.

55
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,479
Why is your life so charmed?

56
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,240
Pity,

57
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,039
your dear junior

58
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,800
wasn't so lucky.

59
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:56,319
Speak!

60
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,759
Did you and Xu Qingqing kill her?

61
00:03:58,759 --> 00:03:59,759
Answer me!

62
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,400
Everyone in the theater is born to die.

63
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,919
Don't you understand?

64
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,199
You scoundrel.

65
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:09,680
You scoundrel.

66
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,360
Kang Shao,

67
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,639
long time no see.

68
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:31,240
Come in.

69
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,079
Yanshu,

70
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:43,279
what's up?

71
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:44,759
Where were you?

72
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,879
Some shops downtown
released new designs.

73
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:49,959
So I went

74
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:51,000
to check them out.

75
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,560
Yanshu.

76
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:00,000
I exist in your heart.

77
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,399
Tell me the truth.

78
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:05,600
What exactly happened that night?

79
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,160
Yanshu,

80
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,680
I didn't kill anyone.

81
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,040
It was Kang Shao.

82
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,399
He wanted Shen Muling dead.

83
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:17,759
I...

84
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,279
I...

85
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:19,839
I just...

86
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,600
I just...

87
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,279
What?

88
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,399
I just

89
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:30,079
helped him slip some drugs.

90
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:33,600
Zhang.

91
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,120
Sir!

92
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:37,480
Commander,

93
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,040
your orders?

94
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,920
Confine her

95
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,160
to her room!

96
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,560
Don't let her set foot outside.

97
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,319
Understood.

98
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:45,800
Yanshu!

99
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:46,639
Don't!

100
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:46,959
Yanshu!

101
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:47,240
Miss!

102
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,040
Yanshu!

103
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:48,720
Miss!

104
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,000
Don't provoke him.

105
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,639
Yanshu!

106
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,680
To your room.

107
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,080
Don't provoke him.

108
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:15,000
Alright.

109
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,319
I'm here.

110
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:24,079
This will all be resolved soon.

111
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,319
You were my father's confidant.

112
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:36,720
But Chunsheng investigated it.

113
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,720
You were expelled from
the Guan family years ago.

114
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:41,319
Answer me!

115
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,319
Did you kill Liang Man

116
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,279
and Yuan?

117
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:46,759
Speak!

118
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,480
Okay.

119
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,920
I'll tell you.

120
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,040
Okay.

121
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,920
I was just following orders!

122
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,959
After Miss Shen entered
the Commander's Mansion,

123
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,319
Miss Xu took a disliking to her.

124
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,839
She ordered me to eliminate her.

125
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:14,360
But then that girl Yuan

126
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,839
barged in recklessly.

127
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,040
Miss Xu had no choice
but to order her death.

128
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,199
You murderer!

129
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:22,519
You murderer!

130
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,040
I'll make you...

131
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,759
What do you want?

132
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,680
Call the police?

133
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,079
Now!

134
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,959
Unless you don't want to learn

135
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,519
the truth behind Lanyu's death.

136
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,360
Ah,

137
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,800
I almost forgot.

138
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:41,879
Lanyu was your birth mother.

139
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,279
Who killed my mother?

140
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:47,120
Tell me!

141
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,920
Who killed my mother?

142
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,720
Want the answer?

143
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,600
Just

144
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,959
release me,

145
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,800
and

146
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,040
get me a train ticket

147
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:09,480
for the day

148
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:11,600
after tomorrow,

149
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,000
plus 100,000 silver coins.

150
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:18,480
Once I'm safely out of Rong City,

151
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,399
I'll send you the information.

152
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:24,120
Well?

153
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:25,959
Not willing?

154
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,639
Fine,

155
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,920
let all these secrets

156
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:33,679
disappear with me.

157
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:47,968
Commander,

158
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,344
Kang Shao was caught.

159
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:05,919
In this case,

160
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:12,200
we should invite Miss Shen here.

161
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:13,399
Yes.

162
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:24,000
Miss Shen staged quite the performance.

163
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:27,879
I believed every act of it.

164
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,080
Mr. Guan,

165
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,039
our Commander just wants

166
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:35,440
to clarify things with Miss Shen.

167
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,360
Xingkai.

168
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:01,320
Commander Xu, please

169
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:01,960
speak plainly.

170
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,120
I know you've captured Kang Shao.

171
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:17,519
But I still hope

172
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,320
Yuan's death

173
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,600
can be laid.

174
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,759
If you and Guan Xingkai

175
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:27,240
want to touch my sister,

176
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:53,480
take my life first.

177
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:06,679
You don't think

178
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:07,720
I would dare to kill you?

179
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,720
You team up with Guan Xingkai

180
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,759
to confront me openly.

181
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:13,799
What does he gain from it?

182
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,399
You'd sacrifice everything

183
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,960
to avenge your master

184
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:25,320
and Yuan

185
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,080
without hesitation.

186
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:29,519
So can I, to protect my sister,

187
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:30,480
abandon my own life.

188
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:34,480
Fundamentally,
we're the same kind of people.

189
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:37,639
We just met too late.

190
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:39,639
Had it been earlier,

191
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,639
nothing and no one

192
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:43,879
could've come between us.

193
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:47,120
Maybe we're the ones who'll deliver

194
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,039
final results.

195
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:01,159
Sorry,

196
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:02,679
I cannot

197
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:03,440
accept this.

198
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:05,480
Your sister

199
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:08,000
tyrannizes others
and commits endless evils.

200
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:10,279
She should bear the consequences

201
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:11,639
she has committed herself.

202
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:16,279
I can't forgive her for Yuan.

203
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:44,000
Thank you for your care
during this time.

204
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:45,480
We'll meet again.

205
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:46,960
Muling...

206
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,240
If to persuade me,

207
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,480
save your breath.

208
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,639
The item.

209
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,200
Take a look.

210
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,360
Keep it safe.

211
00:13:32,614 --> 00:13:35,104
(Republic of China,
Shanghai Station, Third Class)

212
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,365
(100,000 yuan)

213
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,120
You've made the wise choice.

214
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,200
If you leave like this,

215
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,240
I can't find you.

216
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,519
What?

217
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:06,120
Sincerity.

218
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,200
My sincerity is in your hands.

219
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:10,519
Where's yours?

220
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:14,919
Enough.

221
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,399
Any questions?

222
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,879
Who actually killed my mother?

223
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:20,720
Do you think I'm stupid?

224
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:22,240
If I tell you now,

225
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:23,840
will I survive?

226
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:25,879
After I leave.

227
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:38,480
You dare trick me?

228
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:40,864
What'll you do?

229
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:41,480
Calm down.

230
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:42,879
Stay back!

231
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:46,120
You dared to trick me!

232
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:46,799
I can promise

233
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,000
you anything.

234
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:51,360
Promise me?

235
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,360
See for yourself.

236
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,600
How will you promise me?

237
00:14:58,159 --> 00:14:58,480
Yanshu,

238
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,440
it's him

239
00:14:59,808 --> 00:15:00,639
who drugged Miss Shen

240
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:01,600
and tried to kill her!

241
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,399
He also killed Yuan!

242
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,600
I saw it.

243
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:08,768
Xu Yanshu, are you insane?

244
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:10,720
He's a criminal

245
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,320
breaking into my Mansion

246
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,159
and killed someone!

247
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,648
I'm apprehending a criminal!

248
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,639
Such an impressive show of authority.

249
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,559
If I'm not mistaken,

250
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,039
you care about her too, don't you?

251
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:23,679
Here's a deal.

252
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,679
I'll hand her over to you.

253
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:27,720
Let me go. What do you say?

254
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,120
Daydreams.

255
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,360
Just a mere actress.

256
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,200
Why would I care?

257
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,200
Surrender now!

258
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,279
No!

259
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:35,039
Xingkai!

260
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:36,159
Xingkai!

261
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:37,960
Xingkai!

262
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:38,879
Xingkai!

263
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,120
Xingkai! Wake up!

264
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,039
Xingkai!

265
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:43,399
Wake up!

266
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,639
Xingkai.

267
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,159
Xingkai.

268
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,080
Someone.

269
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:54,039
Help!

270
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,519
