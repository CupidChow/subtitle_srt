Xingkai.

15
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,760
Wake up, Xingkai.

16
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:41,879
What are you doing here?

17
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,200
You jinx!

18
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:43,920
You're to blame!

19
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,400
Get out right now!

20
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,519
Why shift blame onto others

21
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:48,400
after making mistakes?

22
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,359
How dare a lowlife like you lecture me!

23
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,680
Leave now!

24
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:52,840
Leave now!

25
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,280
Qingqing,

26
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:54,280
Qingqing.

27
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,560
Stop. We are in hospital.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,799
Let go of me!

29
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,719
Kang Shao has been arrested.

30
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,159
Question him anytime.

31
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,400
As for him,

32
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,319
sorry.

33
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:08,280
Leave now!

34
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,280
Yanshu, let go!

35
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,759
Let go!

36
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:16,759
Don't think I didn't see it.

37
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:19,039
You were the one who shot Guan Xingkai.

38
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:21,479
If the Guan family finds out about this,

39
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,840
forget the marriage,

40
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,520
they'll kill you!

41
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:28,439
Yanshu,

42
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:30,680
I'll make Xingkai change his mind

43
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,800
and return to me.

44
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:33,560
I won't lose to that actress!

45
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,759
Are you insane?

46
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,199
Ma'am.

47
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:51,879
You've disappointed me deeply.

48
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:36,000
Xingkai.

49
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:37,759
Xingkai.

50
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:42,599
Ma'am.

51
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:48,000
Mother.

52
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:49,199
It's all my fault.

53
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,599
If I hadn't forced you
to marry Qingqing,

54
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:55,840
you wouldn't have ended up like this.

55
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:56,879
Mother,

56
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,280
don't say that.

57
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:01,520
I've worried you.

58
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:05,039
Muling had nothing to do with this.

59
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,720
Don't blame her.

60
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,080
This is fate.

61
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,439
During your absence,

62
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,479
I've reflected a lot.

63
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,879
You're my son.

64
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,680
If you're upset,

65
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:20,519
I feel

66
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,439
the pain too.

67
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,560
The Guan family

68
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,959
is like an empty shell.

69
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,480
Since you and Miss Shen
care for each other,

70
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:33,279
here's the deal.

71
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,639
If Miss Shen

72
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,959
agrees to your proposal,

73
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,000
I'll entrust her with managing

74
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:43,800
the Guan household.

75
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,360
Mother,

76
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:51,199
you mean...

77
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,920
Don't get up.

78
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,000
Careful.

79
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:08,879
Xingkai.

80
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,279
Thank you.

81
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,519
Focus on recovering first.

82
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,680
Miss Shen, thank you for your care.

83
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,160
See you, Ma'am.

84
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,639
How are you?

85
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,920
Your wound hasn't healed.

86
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,639
What's up?

87
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:53,360
It's fine.

88
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm happy.

89
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:05,759
Don't come any closer.

90
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:06,680
Stay back!

91
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,879
Stay back!

92
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:08,639
Stay back!

93
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,959
Don't come any closer.

94
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,199
Stay back!

95
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:13,800
Stay back!

96
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,680
Stay back!

97
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:18,279
It wasn't me.

98
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,560
Stay back!

99
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:25,959
Kang Shao,

100
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:27,199
your food.

101
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:28,519
Here.

102
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:31,879
Here.

103
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,439
Eat this.

104
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:33,920
For you.

105
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:41,319
Master,

106
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:45,879
Kang Shao

107
00:07:47,264 --> 00:07:48,000
committed suicide.

108
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:53,560
And...

109
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:55,920
What else?

110
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,879
The next shipment
of medicine to Jiangbei

111
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,000
requires your personal involvement.

112
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,879
These are all
Jiangbei warehouse addresses

113
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,319
and contact codes.

114
00:08:09,312 --> 00:08:10,080
Where's Mr. Zhang?

115
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:16,519
(Sorry.)

116
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:18,240
(The Jiangbei matter)

117
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,240
(still need to trouble you.)

118
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:21,560
(Remember!)

119
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,319
(Be cautious in everything,)

120
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,199
(Wild Fire.)

121
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:33,632
(Be cautious in everything, Wild Fire.)

122
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,039
Master Liu really knows
how to pick a place.

123
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:52,600
The scenery here is truly magnificent.

124
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,279
I think living here in seclusion

125
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:55,120
wouldn't be boring.

126
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:55,720
Right?

127
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:04,120
Well,

128
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,639
your absence from the last meeting

129
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:08,416
of commerce chamber

130
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,200
was because of Mr. Zhang?

131
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:13,120
Back then,

132
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:15,799
I would have agreed.

133
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,360
Let me take that.

134
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,240
Give it to me.

135
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:35,919
You haven't fully recovered yet.

136
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:36,799
I've fully recovered.

137
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:37,320
Give me.

138
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,039
Let me take it!

139
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:39,120
Just hand it over!

140
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,600
Alright.

141
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,039
Keeping fighting over this suitcase

142
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:45,440
will tear it apart.

143
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,480
Help Mr. Guan carry it!

144
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:51,039
Mr. Guan,

145
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:51,679
I'll do it.

146
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:52,039
Thanks.

147
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:52,600
Thank you.

148
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:54,976
Master Liu.

149
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:57,399
Since we last met,

150
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:59,960
your affection has been
even stronger than before.

151
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:04,720
Well...

152
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:10,360
This time, it seems

153
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:12,960
I'll get to drink your wedding wine.

154
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,120
Come inside.

155
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,240
Go.

156
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:24,639
What's wrong?

157
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,240
I'm a bit concerned.

158
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:28,799
About what?

159
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:30,399
Oh.

160
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:31,744
Rest assured.

161
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,440
No one except Master Liu

162
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,240
knows our true identities.

163
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:37,519
That's exactly why I chose

164
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,320
this meeting spot.

165
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:41,000
First here,

166
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:42,679
we'll be cautious.

167
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:44,399
That's not what I meant.

168
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:45,919
What then?

169
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,080
Xingkai,

170
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:52,000
you promise me,

171
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:53,879
no matter what you do,

172
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,879
put your safety first.

173
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:58,600
I've been feeling uneasy lately.

174
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:02,720
Don't talk nonsense.

175
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:04,480
Go.

176
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,399
Master,

177
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,799
the medicine

178
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:12,120
has been stored

179
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:13,720
in the warehouse nearby.

180
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:16,000
Ensure them remain protected.

181
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:17,519
Assign more guards.

182
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:18,360
Understood.

183
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:19,000
Go now.

184
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:24,960
Sorry

185
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,919
for the wait.

186
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,919
Your luggage has been placed.

187
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:28,879
Please follow me.

188
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:33,840
Oh,

189
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:34,519
right.

190
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,039
I forgot to tell you.

191
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:38,320
You arrived

192
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,960
at an unfortunate time.

193
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,600
There's been constant rain,

194
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:44,440
and many rooms are uninhabitable

195
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,279
due to leaks.

196
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,759
Now,

197
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:48,159
there's only one available room

198
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,679
for you to share accommodations.

199
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,519
I wonder...

200
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,000
As arranged.

201
00:11:58,879 --> 00:11:59,200
Fine.

202
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,360
Good.

203
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,279
Okay,

204
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:03,200
I'll take my leave now.

205
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,039
Feel free to ask

206
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:04,799
for anything.

207
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,320
Thank you.

208
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:16,896
Why not come in?

209
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,840
Sleeping outside tonight?

210
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,799
Guan Xingkai!

211
00:12:37,824 --> 00:12:38,528
You take the bed.

212
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,039
What about you?

213
00:12:41,952 --> 00:12:42,880
I'll sleep on the sofa.

214
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:44,840
Oh.

215
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,159
Let's discuss this tomorrow.

216
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:53,840
Get rest early.

217
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,799
