14
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,880
Where's Guan Xingkai?

15
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:33,719
You're awake.

16
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:36,519
You're finally awake.

17
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,240
Where is he?

18
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,159
My men only managed

19
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,920
to save you through the back door.

20
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,120
The fire spread too fast.

21
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,719
My men couldn't get through.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,920
Guan Xingkai...

23
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:13,919
Three days unconscious.

24
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,120
Your theater was burned down,

25
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,719
so your juniors

26
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:23,439
traveled south together

27
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,439
to seek their futures.

28
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,879
Don't you want justice

29
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,520
for yourself and Guan Xingkai?

30
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,280
She's Xingkai's adoptive mother.

31
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,240
I was her target.

32
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,680
Xingkai died saving me.

33
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,360
This vengeance serves no purpose.

34
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:13,319
But what if

35
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,759
she also killed Lanyu?

36
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,360
What do you know?

37
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,479
Pull yourself together.

38
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:41,479
Still half a month before

39
00:03:42,816 --> 00:03:43,759
Madam Guan's birthday.

40
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:46,719
You have enough time

41
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,520
to gather evidence and witnesses.

42
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,240
You must bring the truth

43
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,599
to light.

44
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,520
These three people

45
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:25,480
were killed by you,
directly or indirectly.

46
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,400
Oh, yes.

47
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,360
And Master Guan,

48
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,879
Guan Hanyang.

49
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:32,479
Madam,

50
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:33,679
do you

51
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,399
admit it or not?

52
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,680
That's all nonsense!

53
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,520
Really?

54
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:39,000
You caused my son

55
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,920
to perish in flames on his wedding day.

56
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,680
You vicious woman!

57
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:44,279
Guards!

58
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,079
Take her to the police station!

59
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:47,480
Am I invisible to you?

60
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,200
Madam Guan.

61
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,840
Don't be hasty.

62
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:56,040
Let Miss Shen explain first.

63
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,360
Chief Su happens to be

64
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,200
outside right now.

65
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,120
After figuring out the truth,

66
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,240
we'll see who deserves to be arrested.

67
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,080
Madam Guan,

68
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,920
you always pose as a devout,

69
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,760
compassionate soul.

70
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,600
Don't you wake up

71
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:17,399
haunted by nightmares?

72
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:21,160
Today let me burn three incense sticks

73
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,519
to honor those you've murdered.

74
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,000
The first stick

75
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,920
is for the son

76
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,839
you raised for over a decade,

77
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,440
Guan Xingkai.

78
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,400
Nonsense!

79
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,319
He died saving you!

80
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,560
True.

81
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,879
If not for Xingkai,

82
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:45,000
I wouldn't be standing here today.

83
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:54,519
You pretended to approve our marriage,

84
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,600
making us think

85
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,199
we'd see the light after the storm.

86
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,439
(But on the wedding day,)

87
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:01,560
(you swapped the sedan,)

88
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:04,720
(had Xu Qingqing take my place,)

89
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,879
(locked me in the theater woodshed,)

90
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,759
(and sealed me in a coffin,)

91
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:10,879
(trying to burn me alive)

92
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,759
(and burn down Ruyi Theater.)

93
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,040
(Xingkai noticed something wrong)

94
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:17,600
(and dashed into the fire.)

95
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,959
(Everyone thought we both perished.)

96
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,959
But the truth is,

97
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,439
Xingkai saved me.

98
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,160
And I alone survived.

99
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,519
The second one

100
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:41,680
honors my junior Yuan.

101
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,000
I don't know her at all.

102
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,640
Exactly.

103
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,160
You truly don't know her.

104
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,000
But you know Kang Shao, right?

105
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:56,120
Everyone present here

106
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:58,160
should be familiar with this name.

107
00:06:59,079 --> 00:06:59,919
Yes.

108
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:02,319
He was the right-hand man
of Old Master Guan.

109
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,120
He was kicked out years ago.

110
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,799
Later,

111
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,079
he became your secret lackey.

112
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:11,480
Kang Shao worked for money.

113
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:14,399
He convinced my senior Liang Man
to poison our master,

114
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,079
(collude with Second Master)

115
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,720
(to steal the seal,)

116
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,680
(silence witnesses)

117
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,610
(and destroy evidence.)

118
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,720
(Together with Kang Shao,
they made up lies.)

119
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,839
If Guan Xingkai learned

120
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:26,480
that his mother was killed

121
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,360
by his own father,

122
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,680
what would he do?

123
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,759
You know perfectly well

124
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:35,959
you're the prime suspect.

125
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,199
You've gone through all this trouble

126
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,199
just to frame me, haven't you?

127
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:42,688
Kang Shao hid.

128
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:45,399
Just as we were about to catch him,

129
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:48,680
(he teamed up with Xu Qingqing)

130
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,879
(to eliminate me.)

131
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,360
But tragically,

132
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,079
my junior Yuan

133
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:56,319
overheard their plot.

134
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:58,959
(Because of this,)

135
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:01,279
(she was silenced.)

136
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,240
That's absurd!

137
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,480
The third one

138
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,639
is for two souls.

139
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:18,560
One is my master,

140
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:21,079
Xingkai's biological mother.

141
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:26,519
The other is Old Master Guan,
whom you poisoned to death.

142
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:28,119
Ridiculous!

143
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:30,480
Hanyang and I were deeply in love.

144
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,559
I treated Xingkai as my own son.

145
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,919
Why did I harm them?

146
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,679
Because you care only about
your status as matriarch.

147
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:43,919
My master and Old Master Guan
were in deep love with each other

148
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:44,799
since young.

149
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,360
You forced your way in.

150
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,679
Using your maternal family's power,

151
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,440
you married Old Master Guan.

152
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,399
My master was turned into
his secret mistress.

153
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,480
(Xingkai became an illegitimate child.)

154
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,480
Mother.

155
00:08:58,279 --> 00:08:59,879
Mother.

156
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,200
Fortunately,

157
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,960
you had no children.

158
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,519
So you had to adopt Xingkai.

159
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,720
But over the years,

160
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:10,000
you resented Old Master Guan's

161
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,279
relationship with my master.

162
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,960
You feared Xingkai

163
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,519
might recognize his own mother someday,

164
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,759
threatening your status.

165
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,200
So you schemed endlessly

166
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,519
to kill my master.

167
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,480
Love curdled to poison,

168
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,559
so you poisoned Old Master Guan.

169
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:27,360
(When Xingkai and I investigated,)

170
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:29,600
(to cover your tracks,)

171
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,279
(you silenced Liang Man and Kang Shao.)

172
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,119
Later,

173
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,639
Xingkai competed with
Second Master for leadership.

174
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,679
You poisoned Second Master Guan

175
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:39,960
(to secure your position)

176
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,960
(and put Xingkai in power.)

177
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,040
Madam,

178
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,639
every accusation I've made,

179
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:47,799
do you admit them or not?

180
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,639
What an actress.

181
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,440
Skilled at spinning tales.

182
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,759
Of these wild claims of yours,

183
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,799
where's your proof?

184
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,680
Chief Su.

185
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:11,639
Inside.

186
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,080
Behave yourself. Move!

187
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,120
She is the culprit?

188
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,960
This man

189
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,600
was Old Master Guan's physician.

190
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,040
He can prove

191
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,200
that you had been

192
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:24,240
poisoning Old Master Guan for years,

193
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,000
worsening his illness

194
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,840
to control him.

195
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:28,679
And this

196
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:29,919
is your personal maid,

197
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:31,239
Zhang.

198
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,279
She knows all your dirty secrets

199
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:35,119
from these years.

200
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,999
Madam,

201
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,000
are you sure you want me to continue?

202
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:42,039
Is what she said true?

203
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,759
Did you really cause Hanyang's death?

204
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,840
You vicious woman!

205
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,799
Decades of our benevolence,

206
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,919
only to invite a viper

207
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:51,399
into our halls!

208
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:57,600
Benevolence?

209
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,800
How dare you laugh!

210
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,720
How dare you say that?

211
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,360
A noble lady.

212
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,120
An enviable marriage.

213
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:15,120
The matriarch.

214
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,279
Do you know

215
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,159
how these words

216
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,840
have been piercing my heart

217
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,039
like thorns

218
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,360
for twenty long years!

219
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:34,720
Do you understand?

220
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:39,960
Can you fathom this pain in my chest?

221
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,240
Why?

222
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,679
Why should their marital bliss

223
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,919
cost my son's life?

224
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,080
Back then...

225
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:59,200
Back then, if Guan Hanyang hadn't gone

226
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,320
to meet your master,

227
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,240
that little tramp,

228
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,919
my son

229
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:10,960
wouldn't have been lost!

230
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:17,679
All these years,

231
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,600
every time I saw Guan Xingkai,

232
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:25,120
this brat,

233
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,279
I wished him dead!

234
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,600
Each glimpse of him

235
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:34,639
stabbed my heart

236
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:38,399
with fresh agony.

237
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,279
Why?

238
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:45,759
They had me suffer.

239
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,919
Why would I let their son live in peace?

240
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,840
No.

241
00:12:55,799 --> 00:13:00,279
I'll make sure he lives
in endless torment.

242
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:04,440
I'd have Guan Hanyang and that wretch

243
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:07,240
watch from their graves

244
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,399
as their son suffered!

245
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:12,039
What crime did Guan Xingkai commit?

246
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,799
What does your vengeance

247
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:16,519
have to do with him?

248
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:18,919
Whether it does or not,

249
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:23,200
it's too late now.

250
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,919
But listen up,

251
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,159
I don't regret

252
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,679
anything I've done!

253
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:47,759
Chief Su.

254
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,200
What are you waiting for?

255
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,279
Take them to

256
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,119
the police station.

257
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,560
Take her away.

258
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:56,479
- Yes.
- Yes.

259
00:13:58,279 --> 00:13:59,119
Hands off!

260
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,560
Master.

261
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,960
Xingkai.

262
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:37,599
Yuan.

263
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,960
The justice you sought.

264
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,320
I've reclaimed it for you.

265
00:14:53,949 --> 00:15:02,952
(In the same month, Xu Qingqing
is arrested for alleged murder)

266
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:16,759
Muling.

267
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:25,759
Where are you going?

268
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:26,759
Let me escort you.

269
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,040
Thank you.

270
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,040
No need.

271
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:32,719
Our paths diverge.

272
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,440
The world's in chaos now.

273
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:38,679
You're all alone

274
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:39,519
with nowhere to go.

275
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:41,840
I can protect you.

276
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:47,480
I promised Xingkai

277
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,960
to share life and death, never to part.

278
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,399
I heard there's news
of Wild Fire up north.

279
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:55,840
I'll go there.

280
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,120
I can keep performing where Master

281
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:00,599
studied opera.

282
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,639
Wild Fire's a codename.

283
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:05,919
It could be anyone.

284
00:16:07,584 --> 00:16:08,448
You really think

285
00:16:08,448 --> 00:16:09,480
they're powerful enough

286
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,120
to rescue him undetected?

287
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,720
I never ask for much.

288
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,159
Given the slightest hope,

289
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:17,519
I'll cross oceans and continents

290
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,320
to find him.

291
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,799
If he's truly gone,

292
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,159
I'll live for him

293
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,480
and continue his career.

294
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:31,519
Anyway,

295
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,840
I must thank you, Yanshu.

296
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,000
The frontlines are collapsing.

297
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,440
You'll be deployed soon, right?

298
00:16:39,923 --> 00:16:40,507
Yes.

299
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,120
Fortune favors the just.

300
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,960
Keep yourself safe.

301
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:47,599
Come back unharmed.

302
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,360
We'll probably meet again.

303
00:17:29,952 --> 00:17:30,976
Definitely.

304
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,000
Xingkai.

305
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:15,439
Xingkai.
