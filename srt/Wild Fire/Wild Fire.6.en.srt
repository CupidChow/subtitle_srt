=Episode 6=

14
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:10,599
What?

15
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:12,439
She's taken by the police station?

16
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,079
And she was locked up with Bai Xiaodi.

17
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:18,560
Bai Xiaodi?

18
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:20,680
How could he

19
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,959
happen to be in the same cell?

20
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:23,840
He sent people to hijack our goods.

21
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,879
So we put him in jail.

22
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:26,920
But this time...

23
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,840
Such a coincidence.

24
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:29,599
Is there anything behind?

25
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,640
Someone must have planned that.

26
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,599
You mean...

27
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:36,879
Those crates with opium

28
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,319
are Second Master's?

29
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,640
- Young Master!
- She's in danger!

30
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:07,719
Open the door!

31
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,680
Someone!

32
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,400
Let me out!

33
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,000
Shut up!

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,520
Open up!

35
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,599
Sweetheart.

36
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:28,280
You're dead either way.

37
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,199
Why not

38
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:30,280
enjoy a good time with me?

39
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:32,919
Might save you some loneliness

40
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,120
in the underworld.

41
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,840
I changed my mind.

42
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:38,120
Anyway,

43
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:40,280
I'm gonna die.

44
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:42,879
Sir.

45
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,039
Officer Su!

46
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:56,240
Officer Su.

47
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:58,360
Officer.

48
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:00,400
This is for you.

49
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,680
We won't take long.

50
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,599
I know.

51
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,240
But she is now an important suspect.

52
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,639
Suddenly asking to visit her...

53
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:09,280
Well,

54
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,840
this really puts me in a tough spot.

55
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,599
Officer Su,

56
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:13,919
you're right.

57
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,400
Smart choice.

58
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,520
Go die first!

59
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,080
Shen Muling.

60
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,240
Shen Muling!

61
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:31,879
I'm late.

62
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:33,800
I'll take you back now.

63
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:01,856
Young Master.

64
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,639
What's going on?

65
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:04,399
Mr. Guan.

66
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:05,519
Mr. Guan.

67
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:07,480
You can't take her away.

68
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,160
Officer Su.

69
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:13,959
We will handle it. No worries.

70
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,279
But...

71
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:15,800
It's fine.

72
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,439
Mr. Guan.

73
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,199
Guan family's servant saw

74
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:19,480
Miss Shen killed Liang Man.

75
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,879
She is now a suspect.

76
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:22,839
You really can't take her now.

77
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:26,040
The central police is cracking down.

78
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,279
If anything goes wrong,

79
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,319
I'll be doomed.

80
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:29,959
I was there that night too.

81
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:30,800
So,

82
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,879
should you arrest me as well?

83
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:34,920
No.

84
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:35,759
Chunsheng.

85
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:38,800
Go with the Officer Su

86
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,720
for the bail release.

87
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,199
Officer Su.

88
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:42,720
Let's go.

89
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:42,959
Wait.

90
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:43,759
Let's go.

91
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:44,120
No.

92
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,920
Not about the money.

93
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,439
Besides,

94
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,480
about today,

95
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,959
you should give

96
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:51,279
a proper explanation.

97
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,199
Otherwise, I can't promise

98
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,000
this won't reach the central police.

99
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,519
By then,

100
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:58,560
your position as the chief

101
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,720
might be over.

102
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,000
Mr. Guan!

103
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,519
Officer Su.

104
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:03,319
Please.

105
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:04,839
Go.

106
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,000
Go.

107
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,439
Go away!

108
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:19,199
Don't touch me!

109
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,839
(I'll handle all these things.)

110
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,759
(You can just be)

111
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:31,240
(Miss Shen.)

112
00:06:34,886 --> 00:06:38,112
(Guan Hanyang,
Master of the Guan family)

113
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,079
Looks like

114
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:49,560
Young Master still can't
let go of that woman.

115
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,759
Madam.

116
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:51,839
What to do?

117
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:57,759
Sir.

118
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,680
How is the Master?

119
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,839
Since I changed the medicine,

120
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,399
he has stabilized

121
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,439
quite a bit.

122
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:04,560
At this rate,

123
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,480
he should regain some sensation
by next month.

124
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:09,759
Next month?

125
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:13,079
That might be too late.

126
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,120
Did you prepare

127
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,160
everything I asked for?

128
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:29,040
Yes, Madam.

129
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,959
Xingkai, you're fine?

130
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:45,959
You're back.

131
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:53,959
What's wrong?

132
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,360
I'm happy.

133
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,240
Your clothes

134
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:04,600
got dirty.

135
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:05,839
Change it.

136
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,600
Here.

137
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,880
I'll check the dishes.

138
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,328
Young Master.

139
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,679
This ginger soup
was made by Mr. Guan, right?

140
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:49,320
Where is he?

141
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:52,720
What's wrong?

142
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,600
Tell me.

143
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,080
Senior.

144
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:59,000
He told me not to tell you.

145
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,440
Ma...

146
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,440
Master passed away.

147
00:09:19,174 --> 00:09:22,176
(Commemoration)

148
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,879
(His condition was stable.)

149
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:35,279
(How could he die suddenly?)

150
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:49,240
Everyone.

151
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:51,720
We know the condition now.

152
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,000
Let's discuss what to do next.

153
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:56,759
Seventh Master.

154
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,519
What do you mean?

155
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,200
What do I mean?

156
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:02,200
We Guan family

157
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,320
needs a head.

158
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:06,240
Right.

159
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,840
You didn't see
what they looked like just now.

160
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,000
Like bad luck's come.

161
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,039
Ziming is right.

162
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:12,759
But

163
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,200
we shouldn't rush.

164
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:16,279
If we handle this carelessly,

165
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:18,759
others will say

166
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:19,519
we lack rules.

167
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,720
Normally,

168
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:24,360
the heir

169
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:26,120
should be Xingkai.

170
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,879
But...

171
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:28,600
No way.

172
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,720
Xingkai just returned.

173
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,039
He doesn't know the business.

174
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:34,279
(Is the position of heir)

175
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:35,320
He can't do it.

176
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:38,240
(more important than people's life?)

177
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:39,840
He ran it for years.

178
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,120
If he can be

179
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,519
the head of the family,

180
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:44,120
we can be at ease.

181
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,240
Right.

182
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,480
Back in the day,

183
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,639
when Hanyang was sick,

184
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:49,399
if not for Qingyang

185
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,759
who held the family together,

186
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,039
our family

187
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:53,440
would have broken.

188
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,240
Right.

189
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,440
Hanyang has just passed away.

190
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,519
Let's discuss it

191
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:06,080
until after the funeral.

192
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:07,840
Madam,

193
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,600
that's not right.

194
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:14,559
Without a head,

195
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:16,960
we can't find order.

196
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,519
In my opinion,

197
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,000
we need to settle it soon.

198
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,600
Xingkai.

199
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:25,200
Am I right?

200
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:26,960
(Uncle.)

201
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,240
(Can't you wait even a little?)

202
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:31,240
(This is my father's funeral.)

203
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:35,879
Elders,

204
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,600
my father just passed away.

205
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,279
I believe

206
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:43,559
you're all grieving like I am.

207
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,320
But now

208
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,240
the funeral isn't even over,

209
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:49,720
and someone's already trying

210
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,279
to seize power here.

211
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:52,759
Aren't you afraid

212
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:54,639
of disturbing his peace?

213
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:56,559
Uncle,

214
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,399
what do you say?

215
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,159
What do you mean?

216
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:01,559
Uncle.

217
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,720
You know

218
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,759
what you've done.

219
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,720
We'll settle it later.

220
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,120
But today,

221
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:11,759
here at my father's altar,

222
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,200
I want him to see clearly

223
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:16,799
whether his beloved brother

224
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:19,799
still recognize him

225
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:22,519
and the true symbol of the Guan family.
