Yes.

16

If you still care about your old flame,

17
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,040
it's not too late to go back now.

18
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,319
I've made a promise.

19
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,840
I will stand by my word

20
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,760
and stay by your side.

21
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:46,799
Besides,

22
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:48,719
you should thank me.

23

If I hadn't made this decision,

24
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,560

to approach

26
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:56,680
the Guan family.

27
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,680
You're indeed clever.

28
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,560
Miss Shen

29
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,519
invited me to Mr. Guan's gathering?

30
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:08,240
My senior said

31
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,919
it would surely be what you desire most.

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,520
if I have no connections
to the Guan family,

35
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:26,919
you would build me

36
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:28,080
a stage

37
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,000
within your mansion.

38
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,199
Does that still count?

39
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,639
Of course it does.

40
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,240
The Commander's Mansion
will back you up.

41
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:38,759

42

and all the others in the mansion

43

are at your disposal.

44
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:42,479
I won't interfere.

45
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,800
Thank you, Commander.

46
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,159
Shut up.

47
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,360

(Kang Shao, Guan Hanyang's confidant)

49
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,639
Miss Shen?

50
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:14,759
What is all this?

51
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:17,240
Mr. Kang, I invited you here today

52
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:19,080
only to ask about one matter.

53
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,400
Was it Guan Hanyang
who killed my master?

54
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:26,879
Miss Shen,

55
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,680
you know it.

56
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,719
I've served Master Guan
for so many years...

57
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,960
My master devoted her heart
all these years.

58
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:39,280
Didn't she deserve an answer?

59
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,319
Miss Shen,

60
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:43,039
what are you doing?

61
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:45,800
Guan Hanyang is dead.

62
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,719
I can't seek revenge from him.

63
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:49,919
I just want the truth.

64
00:03:58,719 --> 00:03:59,559
How about this?

65
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,680
If you tell me the truth,

66
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,879
this will be your payment.

67
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,160
When Master Guan
was young and impulsive,

68
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,360
he deeply loved Lanyu.

69
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,560
But after all those years,

70
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,480
with Young Master grown up

71
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,000
and his health deteriorating,

72
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:31,480
Young Master
must inherit the family legacy.

73
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:34,480
Lanyu's existence

74
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,000
became the greatest threat.

75
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,519
If Guan Xingkai was to become
head of the Guan family,

76
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,720
Lanyu had to die.

77
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,439
The Guan family would never allow

78
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:46,800
their patriarch's mother
to be an actress.

79
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:51,160
Miss Shen.

80
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,480
Well, I can see

81
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,680
you care deeply for the young master.

82
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,639
But you must understand

83
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,040
that if he learns
his birth mother's death

84
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,839
was orchestrated by his own father,

85
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,120
and to protect him,

86
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,600
Lanyu willingly sacrificed herself,

87
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,279
he would be tormented for life.

88
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:28,679
Well,

89
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:30,560
according to the autopsy report,

90
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:33,360
the cause of death was opium overdose.

91
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:35,959
But strangely,

92
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:37,519
the deceased had

93
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:39,600
no history of opium use at all.

94
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:41,279
Opium?

95
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,120
Opium again.

96
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,800
So

97
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,800
her death and my father's death...

98
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:55,519
Guan Qingyang is imprisoned.

99
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:58,639
Who else is behind all this?

100
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,440
Speak!

101
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:10,360
That day,

102
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,839
when they found Liang Man's body

103
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:13,720
at the southern courtyard,

104
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,560
someone said

105
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,759
they saw Miss Shen

106
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,439
at the crime scene too.

107
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:19,360
You're still after her?

108
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,600
No.

109
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,279
No.

110
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:22,879
I'm just keeping you informed.

111
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:24,639
Well,

112
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:25,519
the police department

113
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,800
must handle cases impartially, right?

114
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:29,959
If one day

115
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:32,639
we need to bring Miss Shen in
for questioning,

116
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:33,480
how should we...?

117
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:40,720
Then you'll owe me big time.

118
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:44,040
I'll go check things out for you.

119
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,520
After all,

120
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,680
I have some questions for her too.

121
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:12,359
Miss Shen.

122
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,720
You are?

123
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,560
I'm Liusu.

124
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,360
Commander Xu instructed me

125
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,759
to take you back to rest.

126
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,160
He'll come for you after finishing work.

127
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,080
Okay.

128
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:26,719
Let me handle this.

129
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,240
Don't worry, Miss Shen.

130
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,120
You'll get used to

131
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,399
such arrangements in time.

132
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:31,920
This way, please.

133
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,879
Please follow me.

134
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:42,599
Miss Shen,

135
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:43,279
the first floor

136
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:44,480
has the living room

137
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,320
and dining room.

138
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,639
The Commander's office is also here.

139
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:51,719
The Commander's

140
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,640
bedroom is here.

141
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:54,519
Miss Xu's bedroom is here.

142
00:07:55,479 --> 00:07:56,319
Miss Shen,

143
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,879
you stay on the second floor for now.

144
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,519
Once you marry the Commander...

145
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:02,319
Who said she can marry my brother?!

146
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,000
My lady is asking you.

147
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,079
Don't you know your place?

148
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,479
I...

149
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,040
Forgive me, my lady!

150
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,360
Please spare my life.

151
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,040
Since you know,

152
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,040
then slap yourself!

153
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:31,719
I...

154
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,759
Wait!

155
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,280
Miss Xu,

156
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,039
bring it on at me

157
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,399
instead of a maid.

158
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,680
Very well.

159
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,399
Since you're so eager
to marry into this place,

160
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,440
let me teach you

161
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,919
the rules of this household.

162
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,119
Someone!

163
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,240
Hold her down

164
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:02,679
and slap her face.

165
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,320
Don't touch her!

166
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:29,719
Why did you stop?

167
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,800
Keep going!

168
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,200
Why are you here?

169
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,120
I'm here to see
how you're managing without me.

170
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,919
Doesn't look too good.

171
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:12,000
Xingkai.

172
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,720
If you take one more step,

173
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:26,879
blood will spill in this mansion.

174
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:30,519
The medical kit?

175
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:31,320
Up...

176
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,160
Upstairs.

177
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,639
Mr. Guan, I'll show you.

178
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:56,759
This way.

179
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,080
Close the door.

180
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,920
What are you doing?

181
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,440
What are you doing?

182
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:05,639
This...

183
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,279
What are you doing?

184
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,920
Miss Shen,

185
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:12,720
you should thank me.

186
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:15,399
I just saved your life.

187
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,320
You shouldn't have intervened.

188
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,320
It's Commander's place,

189
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,160
not your place.

190
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,200
For Yanshu's sake,

191
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:25,600
Miss Xu wouldn't have harmed me.

192
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,200
Yanshu?

193
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:30,679
I wasn't aware

194
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:32,759
you and the Commander were so close.

195
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:35,480
Since when?

196
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:37,600
The theater was wrecked?

197
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,480
Or when Yuan got hurt?

198
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,200
That's my business.

199
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:43,799
I owe you no explanations.

200
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:50,000
Why do you

201
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,080
insist on being with him?

202
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:56,399
What are you doing?

203
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,639
Let me go!

204
00:11:57,639 --> 00:11:59,080
Today I'll show you exactly

205
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:01,279
what personal matters really look like.

206
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,440
Let me go!

207
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:12,920
Let me go.

208
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,120
Then kill me.

209
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,840
Let me go.

210
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:39,719
Let go!

211
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,120
Why exactly?

212
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:46,120
Can't you understand?

213
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,519
I've never been sincere with you.

214
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:50,080
I was just playing a role.

215
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:52,320
Before, it was for my master's sake.

216
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:53,960
Now that I've avenged her.

217
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,960
I'm going to find my own path.

218
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,879
Is that wrong?

219
00:12:57,879 --> 00:12:58,719
What about Liang Man?

220
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,159
You knew she was dead,

221
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:00,999
yet hid it from me.

222
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,800
Muling,

223
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,080
we promised

224
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,879
to face everything together.

225
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,440
Muling,

226
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:11,639
why abandon me now?

227
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:18,480
I have nothing to say.

228
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:20,000
Leave!

229
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,960
Miss Shen means you should leave.

230
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,239
Don't you understand?

231
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,560
Please.

232
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:57,719
Are you alright?

233
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:12,359
Miss Shen,

234
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:14,440
I think Mr. Guan

235
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,720
genuinely cares for you.

236
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:17,600
Why do you...?

237
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,200
Fate plays cruel tricks.

238
00:14:23,719 --> 00:14:24,559
Why can't heaven

239
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:26,000
be kinder to him?

240
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,279
You've endured enough too.

241
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,919
Rest early tonight.

242
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,240
Take this medicine.

243
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:36,480
The Guans' remedy.

244
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:37,599
Very effective.

245
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:39,920
Go now.

246
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,240
(Why does his laughter still echo?)

247
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,399
(Why do lonely nights
stretch endlessly?)

248
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,879
(Why can't I untangle this turmoil?)

249
00:14:53,716 --> 00:14:58,368
(To Peiqin)

250
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,039
Tell her...

251
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:40,920
Forget it.

252
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,040
(Second Master,)

253
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,879
(you added opium
into the medicinal herbs.)

254
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:53,519
(This is a capital crime.)

255
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,360
(Money is useless.)

256
00:15:56,919 --> 00:16:00,159
(Please don't make things difficult
for a lowly officer like me.)
