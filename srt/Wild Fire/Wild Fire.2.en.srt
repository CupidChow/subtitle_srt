I'm an actress.

Staying with me

(Xingkai, my son. I won't be alive
for long. You must live on.)

37
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,744
It is Master's handwriting.

38
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,520
Miss Shen,

39
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:42,560
what do you plan to do now?

40
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:46,240
You don't think I killed Master?

41
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:47,919
You believe me?

42
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,639
Without the pendant and this letter,

43
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:52,680
do you think

44
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,800
you could walk out of there alive?

45
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,280
I will find out

46
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:00,560
the culprit who killed her.

47
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,319
As for you,

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,639
you are now involved with me.

49
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:06,879
They see you as my mistress.

50
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,840
I offer you this chance,
and will you take it?

51
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,919
Senior. Are you alright?

52
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:25,520
I'm fine.

53
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:27,080
Guan Xingkai

54
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,400
is Master's son.

55
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,039
What?

56
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:34,039
How could he be...

57
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:38,960
Master has many things

58
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,919
hidden from us.

59
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,560
That fire

60
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,280
was not just an accident.

61
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:47,080
What is it?

62
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:49,240
Senior.

63
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,919
Many people came here today.

64
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,599
You'll have to go on stage.

65
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,319
But now...

66
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,240
(I need to know
who caused my mother's death.)

67
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,599
(Miss Shen, you can think about)

68
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:01,800
(what to do next.)

69
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,712
It's okay.

70
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,439
I don't care about rumors at all.

71
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,319
But Master's death is still unclear.

72
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,240
It might be complicated.

73
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,759
The investigation will be risky.

74
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:14,960
Let's keep avoiding contact,

75
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:17,879
so I don't cause trouble for you

76
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,639
and our theater.

77
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,319
Okay.

78
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,160
Young master, you told Miss Shen
about your background.

79
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:28,480
Can you trust her?

80
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:31,319
What if she did kill...

81
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:33,199
Well...

82
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,639
If she were the murderer,

83
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,639
she wouldn't have visited Liang Man.

84
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:39,959
All these years,

85
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:42,600
she's been caring for my mother.

86
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,360
I should thank her.

87
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,519
But this fire

88
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:50,160
not only killed my mother,

89
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:52,519
but also ruined her.

90
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,439
Then...

91
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:56,839
Chunsheng,
buy the theater in the west of the city.

92
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:57,519
Go now.

93
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:58,720
Yes.
