take people in.

Don't worry about me.

Got it.

If I can't come back,

20

drop my mother's case.

21
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:28,719
No.

22
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,560
I'll keep digging.

23
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,640
You must return to protect me.

24
00:01:33,312 --> 00:01:34,368
Young Master.

25
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,400
If I can't return,

26
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:50,400
I'll send you away.

The other goods

31
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:30,639
have been moved to the warehouse.

32
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:31,840
All hot stuff.

33
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,759
We just want the goods,

34
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,319
didn't plan to kill.

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,680
But you walked right in?

36
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:01,240
Name your price.

37
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,159
I must take the goods.

38
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,080
You're bold.

39
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:11,080
Do you believe

40
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,000
I won't let you leave?

41
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:17,319
You've seen the goods.

42
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:19,319
You must know

43
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:22,719
if anything happens to them,

44
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,080
do you think

45
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:26,240
the people here

46
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:29,080
will survive?

47
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,520
Alright.

48
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,599
Let's follow the rules.

49
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:47,360
Dare to bet your life?

50
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,240
Whoever wins

51
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,400
gets the goods.

52
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,120
If you don't dare,

53
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:14,280
go now

54
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,639
and leave the goods.

55
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:22,000
Young Master, no!

56
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:44,519
I hope

57
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,519
you'll keep your word.

58
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:49,888
Young Master.

59
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,959
Your life is worth more.

60
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,720
Think it through.

61
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,079
Half and half.

62
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,160
Don't!

63
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:11,720
Senior.

64
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:14,160
We all know

65
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:15,399
you couldn't

66
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:16,720
have pulled this off alone.

67
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,519
But clearly,

68
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:20,360
your backers have ditched you.

69
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:22,399
If you want to live,

70
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:24,920
work with us.

71
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:27,759
Shen Muling,

72
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:28,759
why won't you just die!

73
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:30,240
You should be dead!

74
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:32,519
Don't!

75
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,480
Murder!

76
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:47,600
Murder!

77
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,040
Shen Muling wants to kill me!

78
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:50,199
Let's go.

79
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:50,959
Take the goods.

80
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:51,552
Young Master.

81
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,319
What do you mean?

82
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,040
Hurry up.

83
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:06,279
Check these two crates carefully.

84
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:07,839
Tie them tightly.

85
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:09,319
Yes.

86
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,160
Young Master.

87
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:12,720
You just scared me.

88
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,800
How did you do it?

89
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,879
(Webley Mk II revolver weighs 1.08 kg.)

90
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,360
(Bullets weigh 17g each.)

91
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,800
(There were no bullets inside at all.)

92
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,560
I knew you wouldn't leave me.

93
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,480
I didn't betray you.

94
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,120
Sorry you suffered.

95
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:02,000
I can't take it anymore.

96
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:04,759
When will you take me out?

97
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:08,839
I won't leave you.

98
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,759
Drink the medicine.

99
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:14,759
I'll take you out.

100
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,399
Drink it and I'll take you out.

101
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:44,639
Hold her!

102
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,919
Be good.

103
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:49,679
It'll be quick.

104
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:50,799
Very soon.

105
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,360
Just a little longer.

106
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,360
Just a little longer.

107
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,080
(Liang Man is our only lead.)

108
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:04,759
(We need a plan.)

109
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:07,440
Miss. Shen.

110
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:14,279
It's reported

111
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:16,759
Liang Man died in Guan's back house.

112
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,720
According to the guard,

113
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,759
you're a murder suspect.

114
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:22,919
Miss Shen.

115
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,120
Please.

116
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,088
Young Master!

117
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:46,399
Young Master.

118
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,200
Bad news.

119
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:47,840
Young Master.

120
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:49,879
You went out?

121
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,879
Madam has been looking for you.

122
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,480
She's at the ancestral hall.

123
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:54,759
Alright.

124
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:55,559
Go.

125
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,759
Miss Shen's taken by the police station.

126
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:01,320
What?

127
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:07,200
Mother.

128
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:07,759
I'm here.

129
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:09,480
Come over.

130
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,000
Kneel.

131
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,240
Offer incense to your mother.

132
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:51,960
Your mother

133
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,720
was a wonderful woman.

134
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:57,360
Talented and beautiful.

135
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,360
That year,

136
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,039
if it weren't for your grandfather,

137
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,440
you wouldn't

138
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,679
have been separated.

139
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,960
Your father and I

140
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,320
wouldn't

141
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,679
be so distant

142
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,480
all these years.

143
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,639
This is fate.

144
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,559
Mother.

145
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:27,919
I see you

146
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,799
just as my birth mother.

147
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,000
Xingkai.

148
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,000
Over these years,

149
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,120
thank you.

150
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,279
Or I wouldn't have made it through

151
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,799
these bitter years.

152
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,480
Mother.

153
00:12:03,398 --> 00:12:05,216
(Rong City Police Department)

154
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:06,120
Get in.

155
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:08,480
I've said,

156
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,559
I didn't kill Liang Man.

157
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,919
Miss Shen.

158
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:12,039
That's not up to you.

159
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:13,960
We'll find out in interrogation.

160
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,480
You are a regular here,

161
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,120
know the rules.
