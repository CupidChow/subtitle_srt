Master.

Master.

17
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:40,639
Muling,

18
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:42,359
I'm here.

19
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:17,439
Had a nightmare?

20
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:23,360
Thinking about Kang Shao's suicide?

21
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:30,000
We were so close
to uncovering the truth.

22
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,280
But still...

23
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,719
All we can do now
is to focus on the present.

24
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:41,599
Stop overthinking.

25
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:42,879
Get some rest.

26
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:46,719
I'll stay with you.

28
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,520
Muling.

00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,360
Muling.

30
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,639
You're up so early.

31
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,240
Come eat.

32
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,080
I made it myself.

33
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,120
Try it.

34
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:47,840
Then I must savor it.

35
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,120
I don't cook often.

36
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:52,879
Tell me if it's good.

37
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,240
Anything you make

38
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:56,719
will be delicious.

39
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,080
Go on, try it.

40
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,128
Get full just watching me?

41
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:15,000
You're very aware of your charm.

42
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,800
Just eat.

43
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,640
Have a taste.

44
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:21,599
If only we can live

45
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:23,399
a life like this forever.

46
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,680
Simple meals are fine occasionally.

47
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,839
But eating them every day

48
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:31,679
would get tiresome.

49
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,799
As long as you're here,

50
00:04:40,448 --> 00:04:41,480
it'll never be tiresome.

51
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:45,959
Did I put sugar in this porridge?

52
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,199
Why don't you taste it as well?

53
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:02,759
There's still soup in the kitchen.

54
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:03,800
I'll check if it's ready.

55
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:15,799
Young Master,

56
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,080
Mr. Yamada arrived.

57
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:21,679
Mr. Yamada arrived?

58
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,479
What's he here for?

59
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,840
It tastes good.

60
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,920
Mr. Guan.

61
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:05,759
You are

62
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,959
Mr. Fujizono's most trusted man.

63
00:06:08,559 --> 00:06:09,399
I'm sorry that

64
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,680
you'd dine in our humble

65
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:12,479
countryside.

66
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,399
Xingkai, long time no see.

67
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,000
Oh.

68
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:21,360
Let me introduce you.

69
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,640
Mr. Yamada

70
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,399
was my classmate
during my study in France.

71
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,080
But now,

72
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:30,279
If I'm not mistaken,

73
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,759
he assists Mr. Fujizono

74
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:34,239
with stability

75
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,440
in Rong City.

76
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,159
Please,

77
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,320
have a seat.

78
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,040
Given your busy schedule,

79
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,360
may I ask about purpose

80
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,200
of your visit?

81
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:03,040
It's been a while
since Mr. Fujizono took over

82
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,360
Japanese Commerce Chamber here.

83
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:06,360
I believe everyone present

84
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,519
can see

85
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,279
how prosperous

86
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,000
Rong City has become

87
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,439
under his leadership.

88
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,160
What I mean is,

89
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,000
as leaders of Rong City's
commerce and culture,

90
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:21,360
don't you two

91
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:23,239
think it's proper

92
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,879
to show some gratitude?

93
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,760
Of course.

94
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:36,279
However,

95
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:37,399
what to do?

96
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:38,680
Mr. Fujizono

97
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,319
has always admired
traditional Chinese culture.

98
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:44,959
He's heard Miss Shen is Rong City's
popular opera star,

99
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,239
and holds respect.

100
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,560
If Miss Shen graces us
with her presence,

101
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,680
Mr. Fujizono must be...

102
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:04,439
You're being ungrateful.

103
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:28,119
Muling.

104
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,399
Performing once for Japanese

105
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,639
won't cost my dignity.

106
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,680
Right?

107
00:08:39,744 --> 00:08:40,768
I know you don't want it.

108
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,800
But you need

109
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,320
the shipment delivered?

110
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,680
Go back.

111
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,480
You all go back.

112
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:37,719
I'll clean up here.

113
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:38,599
Alright.

114
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,920
Young Master,

115
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:45,879
right after you left,

116
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,000
those guys started making threats.

117
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:51,399
They warned Miss Shen
not to choose the hard way.

118
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:53,639
Mr. Yamada said that

119
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,040
he'll await replies.

120
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:58,519
Master Liu,

121
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,320
it was my reckless impulse.

122
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:02,960
I've caused troubles.

123
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:06,399
You did right.

124
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,799
Opera is our ancestors' legacy.

125
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,519
Using it to serve them

126
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:15,440
would dishonor our ancestors.

127
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:17,759
Master Liu,

128
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,720
I might disappoint you.

129
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,359
Muling,

130
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:29,919
I know you well enough.

131
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,440
You couldn't possibly

132
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:34,799
sink this low willingly.

133
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:36,639
Master Liu,

134
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:39,080
I don't want to perform.

135
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,080
What will happen

136
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,960
if I refuse?

137
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:45,600
What about the people in Jiangbei?

138
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:59,720
Better to die standing

139
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:02,120
than live on our knees.

140
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:03,759
You have your principles,

141
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:06,320
but they are alive!

142
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:08,279
I can't just watch them suffer.

143
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,920
