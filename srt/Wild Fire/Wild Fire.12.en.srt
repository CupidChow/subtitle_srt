Why is it you?

54
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,560
Well.

55
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,439
That day,

56
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:14,439
if the fire

57
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:16,519
had killed you and your master,

58
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,519
perhaps

59
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,360
there wouldn't be so much trouble.

60
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,879
You're a murderer, a smuggler.

61
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,399

62

what's coming.

63
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,000
And so do many in the Guan family.

64
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:35,240
Most of all, Guan Xingkai.

65
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:35,959
What do you mean?

66
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,639
You saved Liang Man.

67
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,240
Didn't she tell you?

68
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,839
By the time we got there,

69
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:44,079
Lanyu was already dead.

70
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:45,839
Kang Shao was there first.

71
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:48,040
He is Elder Brother's man.

72
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,160
Without Guan Xingkai,

73
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,000
Lanyu wouldn't have died.

74
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:54,439
He's the one truly responsible.

75
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,519
Guan Xingkai deserves to die.

76
00:07:58,399 --> 00:07:59,040
And,

77
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,199
think about it.

78
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,639
Lanyu was just an actress.

79
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,040
How could she compare
to Guan family's estate?

80
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,639
How could Elder Brother rest in peace,

81
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,600
with the Guan heir's actress mother

82
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,519
still a loose end?

83
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,519
You're about to die.

84
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,519
Stop dragging in the dead.

85
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:38,039
You don't understand the Guan family.

86
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:39,960
Think about it.

87
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,639
If Guan Xingkai knew his mother

88
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,879
was killed by his own father

89
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:49,720
because of him,

90
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,360
what would he do?

91
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,120
Ridiculous.

92
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:02,639
You have no proof,

93
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,440
but throw the dirt

94
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,799
onto a dead person.

95
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:06,559
Who'd believe you?

96
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,840
If you don't believe,

97
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,000
you can ask Kang Shao.

98
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,559
And,

99
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,679
isn't Liang Man your senior?

100
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,279
Go ask her.

101
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,000
Well,

102
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:17,600
I remember

103
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:19,720
she might be leaving town.

104
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,240
Hurry up, or it will be too late.

105
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,360
Goodbye.

106
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:41,720

108
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:47,080
(I can do for you.)

109
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,519
Senior.

110
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,559
Senior?

111
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:28,720
Senior.

112
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,600
Senior!

113
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:47,080
(If it's true,)

114
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,279
(what should you do?)

115
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,720
Lanyu was just an actress.

116
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:18,320

to Guan family's estate?

121
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:41,000
was killed by his own father

122
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,960
because of him,

123
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,519
what would he do?

124
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,399
(Master.)

125
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,879
(If Guan Hanyang
truly caused your death,)

126
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,679
(then your love was wrongly placed.)

127
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,480
(Rest assured.)

128
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,919
(I will find out)

129
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:00,159
(what happened that day.)

130
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:01,320
(But...)

131
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,639
I remember as a child,

132
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:19,200
my father would stargaze with my mother.

133
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,840
Maybe it was fate.

134
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,559
They were destined to separate.

135
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,080
Look.

136
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,000
How bright they are.

137
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,759
But he truly loved her.

138
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,879
Their love

139
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,360
was truly beautiful.

140
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,120
I'll never forget those scenes.

141
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:55,120
And

142
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,720
I've always wished

143
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,840
for the same kind of love.

144
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,440
Although I was sent abroad young,

145
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,559
with no one around,

146
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:11,399
that love

147
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,600
and warmth

148
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,080
stayed with me

149
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:19,159
and carried me through.

150
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,919
It's the greatest gift

151
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:26,720

(If that is the truth,)

155
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:14,120

Sorry, Boss.

I'll take the record.

- I'll swing by again.

stay away from him,

and come to my mansion.

175

- Indeed.

195
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:25,664
Put here.

196
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,799
Never seen anything like it!

197
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:28,360
Come.

198
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,159
So beautiful!

199
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:32,799
Yuan.

200
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:33,320
Yes.

201
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:35,320
Let me introduce to you.

202
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,440
This is high-end.

203
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:37,639
Young Master...

204
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:38,240
Where's Muling?

205
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:38,919
Spent a lot

206
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:39,960
to ship it here.

207
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,679
It's a gramophone.

208
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:42,240
I just saw her going to the room.

209
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,440
It can record people's voices

210
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,840
on this disc.

211
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,840
Let me demonstrate.

212
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,000
Why didn't you come?

213
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,839
Afraid I won't go see live?

214
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:33,119
Go.

215
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,200
The gramophone's here.

216
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,279
See it.

217
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,319
What?

218
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:52,720
The truth's out.

219
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:55,119
The rest

220
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:56,200
is up to you.

221
00:17:57,279 --> 00:17:58,519
I don't want to be involved.

222
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,440
What?

223
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,839
You're leaving?

224
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,599
You and I are different.

225
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:08,160
You are of noble birth.

226
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,200
I'm just an actress.

227
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:13,000
Muling.

228
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:15,960
What's with you today?

229
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:20,720
Shen Muling.

230
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:23,960
Senior.

231
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,240
It's starting!

232
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:28,720
Go.

233
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,359
Make it clear.

234
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,000
You must be scared.

235
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:42,839
I was just rehearsing.

236
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:45,079
Perhaps I got into the role.

237
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,279
Yes.

238
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:51,720
She's always like that.

239
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,599
I also got scared many times.

240
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,240
Rest assured.

241
00:18:58,079 --> 00:18:58,480
Let's go.

242
00:18:58,799 --> 00:18:59,000
Okay.

243
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,359
Senior.

244
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:05,880
When will our new play be performed?

245
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,519
Into the role?

246
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,359
Did she just get into it?
