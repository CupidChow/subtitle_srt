Thanks.

00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,800
Wow.

18
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,000
This fabric is great.

19
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,639
Right.

20
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,120
Look at this.

21
00:02:50,016 --> 00:02:51,776
(Wedding Certificate)
Muling must be happy.

Master, don't leave.

28
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,479
Master, come back.

Muling.

34
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,240
Are you okay?

35
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:52,800
Xingkai.

36
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:54,520
What brings you here?

37
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:56,039
I missed you.

38
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:57,639
Nightmare?

39
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,159
Before the wedding,

40
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:10,680
we shouldn't meet.

41
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,639
It's not lucky.

42
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:13,080
I don't care.

43
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:14,159
All I know is

44
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,439
I missed you,

45
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:17,000
so I came.

46
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:21,839
Muling.

47
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,600
The wedding is for show,

48
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,240
but I prepared

49
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,759
tonight just for you.

50
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:30,720
What?

51
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:32,680
Follow me.

52
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:29,800
When I studied in France,

53
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,439
I vowed to myself

54
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:34,319
that one day I'd waltz

55
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:35,160
with the one I love.

56
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,720
At Commander's Mansion,

57
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:38,959
upon seeing you dance with Xu Yanshu,

58
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,120
I wanted to snatch you away.

59
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:43,920
Really?

60
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,160
I saw you enjoying yourself

61
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,160
with Xu Qingqing.

62
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:50,279
Muling.

63
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:52,519
From now on,

64
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,600
there'll be no one between us.

65
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,720
Nothing can

66
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,959
separate us but death.

67
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,399
I'll protect you forever.

68
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,000
Xingkai.

69
00:06:38,656 --> 00:06:39,079
Muling.

70
00:06:40,512 --> 00:06:41,399
Will you marry me?

71
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,480
I'll love you

72
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,279
forever.

73
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:03,399
Yes, I do.

74
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:08,839
Go back.

75
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:11,160
About you and Xingkai,

76
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:13,199
I need more time to consider.

77
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:20,720
Ma'am.

78
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,800
But now Xingkai

79
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,439
is determined to marry that actress.

80
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:25,839
There's no room

81
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,959
for compromise, right?

82
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:34,840
Leave the rest to me.

83
00:08:41,892 --> 00:08:42,511
Okay.

84
00:08:57,376 --> 00:08:58,336
(Tablet of Guan Hanyang)
(Guan Hanyang.)

85
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:01,320
(Why should you have happiness)

86
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,679
(while my child gets sacrificed?)

87
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:06,639
(You all deserve to die.)

88
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:08,919
(Guan Xingkai)

89
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,039
(is just a brat.)

90
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:14,200
(I won't let him end well.)

91
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,279
(I'll let the Guan family)

92
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,039
(suffer a lot.)

93
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,200
First comb for lifelong love.

94
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,000
(Happiness)
Second comb for growing old together.

95
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:38,240
Third comb
for generations of descendants.

96
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,720
Fourth comb...

97
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,039
Time flies.

98
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,320
I never expect

99
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:43,879
you'd be getting married.

100
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,279
If Master could witness...

101
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:47,120
What are you doing?

102
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:49,080
Why cry on the wedding day?

103
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,240
Everyone, don't be like this.

104
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:53,320
Muling marrying into the Guan family

105
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,200
is a good thing.

106
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:56,039
She's going to live comfortably.

107
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:57,639
We should be happy for her.

108
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,000
That's right.

109
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,080
Exactly.

110
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,039
Though I'm marrying
into Guan family today,

111
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,919
Ruyi Theater will

112
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,840
always be my home.

113
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,320
You'll always be my family.

114
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:11,799
Don't worry.

115
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,480
I'll visit often.

116
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,200
Besides,

117
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,080
I'll also be back
to check on your progress.

118
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:18,600
Don't slack off.

119
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:19,759
Alright.

120
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:26,559
What are you doing here?

121
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,039
It's almost time.

122
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:28,840
Why are you here?

123
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:30,919
Muling hasn't been married off.

124
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:31,960
Can't we

125
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,159
even talk for a moment?

126
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:34,080
Zhang.

127
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:35,320
You've worked hard.

128
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,200
A small token of thanks.

129
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:38,759
I hope you'll accept it.

130
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,879
You are always sensible.

131
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,240
Madam sent me to pick you up.

132
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,960
If anything goes wrong

133
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,399
and the wedding gets delayed,

134
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:54,840
I couldn't bear the responsibility.

135
00:11:13,536 --> 00:11:14,240

Congrats!

136
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,679

00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:16,360
Please come in.

138
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:18,399
Mr. Gao,

139
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,279
welcome!

140
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,120
Please come in.

141
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:20,639
Please.

142
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:26,399
Mr. Guan.

143
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:27,279
Congrats!

144
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:27,759
Anxious?

145
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,919
It's not time yet.

146
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,679
The bridal sedan
will circle around most of the city.

147
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:33,759
Don't be anxious.

148
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:35,360
I know it.

149
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:40,799
Thanks a lot!

150
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:41,559
Please come in.

151
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,799
I'm surprised you can come today.

152
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,879
How unexpected.

153
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,120
I must

154
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:56,639
be here.

155
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,799
Later, I'll propose a toast to you

156
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,200
on Muling's behalf.

157
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,960
May your wishes come true.

158
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:06,240
No need.

159
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,720
It has come true.

160
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:10,559
Come in!

162
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,679
How lively!

163
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:20,440
How impressive.

164
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,639
Lift the sedan!

165
00:12:29,408 --> 00:12:30,600
Congratulations!

166
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:05,639
They're here!

Great.

171
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,120
Great.

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:37,519
Muling.

173
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,120
I've waited ages for this.

174
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,360
Zhang, have we arrived?

175
00:13:59,480 --> 00:13:59,960
Zhang.

176
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:40,240
Great.

177
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,120
Great.

178
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,440
The bride steps through the door,

179
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,440
bringing wealth to the home.

180
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,360
May the family is safe and sound,

181
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,919
