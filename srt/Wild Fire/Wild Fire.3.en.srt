Senior.

15
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,680
My junior is here.

16
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,040
Things have truly changed.

17
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,599
You're having a hard time recently.

18
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:31,079
So I should support your business.

19
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:34,920
I should be grateful, Senior.

20
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,760
At the previous gatherings,

21
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,200
I was always the one entertaining them.

22
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,920
Experience it today yourself.

23
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:46,000
After all,

24
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,799
Master never let you suffer.

25
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,640
Yes, Senior.

26
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,319
Kneel.

27
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,480
Call me Second Madam.

28
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,879
Who do you think you are

29
00:01:57,879 --> 00:01:59,319
to associate yourself with me?

30
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,199
Yes, Second Madam.

31
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,479
You're much more resilient than before.

32
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,000
Not long ago, you were still
flourishing in Rong City.

33
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,879
How does it feel now?

34
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,280
You want to kill me?

35
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:49,319
Do you think I don't hate you?

36
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:53,000
Why is it that everyone only sees you?

37
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:55,560
Why are you so high and mighty?

38
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,080
You should've died together with Master,

39
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:01,719
since you had a mother-daughter bond.

40
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:03,319
You...

41
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,120
People in the troupe used to say

42
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,840
it's lowly for me to be a concubine.

43
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,479
Now,

44
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,800
even the troupe head
has become a mistress.

45
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,159
What do they say now?

46
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,800
Silly me.

47
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:27,960
I said it wrong.

48
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,080
At least I am official

49
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:33,039
with a proper title.

50
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,159
But you, Miss Shen,

51
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,439
are just something kept outside.

52
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:44,039
You are even lower than me.

53
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,000
Yes.

54
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:02,759
Wait.

55
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,719
Come here on your knees.

56
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,544
What are you doing?

57
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,519
Second Madam!

58
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:42,439
I'm sorry!

59
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:43,879
I didn't mean it.

60
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:45,664
Since when is there a Second Madam here?

61
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:46,519
You...

62
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,560
What happened?

63
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,360
Madam.

64
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,360
It's my fault.

65
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,399
I was clumsy

66
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:15,040
and offended Second Madam.

67
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,480
Second Madam?

68
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:17,560
What is that?

69
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,079
We only has a second concubine.

70
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:21,240
There is no Second Madam.

71
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,079
It seems

72
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,680
she misses her sisters in the troupe.

73
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:31,360
A concubine who used to be an actress

74
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,399
is so attached to the theater?

75
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:34,720
What are you doing here?

76
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,759
Zhang.

77
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:37,680
Yes.

78
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:39,199
Liang Man,

79
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,639
since you have married into our family,

80
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:44,040
you must follow our rules.

81
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,040
Now,

82
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,399
the master is bedridden

83
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:49,759
and Xingkai has just returned.

84
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:52,480
You should understand the importance

85
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,560
of harmony and prosperity.

86
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:54,600
Madam.

87
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:55,560
It's her.

88
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:56,959
How dare you!

89
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:59,759
The madam is lecturing.
How dare you interrupt!

90
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,120
She's new here.

91
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:02,160
Ms. Zhang,

92
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,759
you haven't taught her

93
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,160
the rules well enough.

94
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,360
Yes, Young Master.

95
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:08,680
Someone!

96
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:09,959
Punish her.

97
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,240
Yes.

98
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:12,360
Madam, I'm sorry!

99
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:12,879
Madam!

100
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:13,800
Madam!

101
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,160
I don't mean it, Madam!

102
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,360
Madam!

103
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:18,319
Madam!

104
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,879
For Liang's improper behavior,

105
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:24,360
from today, she'll copy the Lotus Sutra

106
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,040
and stay in the Buddha hall

107
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,120
to reflect on herself.

108
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,399
(Senior,)

109
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,160
(hang in there.)

110
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
(The show is just beginning.)

111
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,240
How dare you

112
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,879
look for trouble with my girl!

113
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:43,279
I'll help you regain your dignity.

114
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,160
Mr. Guan.

115
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:52,399
She dared to bully my girl.

116
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,160
Give her a good scolding.

117
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,600
If you do it well,

118
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,319
each will be given 10 silver coins.

119
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:00,680
No wonder the Ruyi Theater
couldn't hold its ground back then.

120
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,680
She has evil intentions.

121
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,000
Look how she's bullied Miss Shen.

122
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,560
I feel sorry for her.

123
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,279
Vicious. Always thinking
about harming people.

124
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,279
And always the kind ones.

125
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:10,279
Exactly.

126
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:11,439
She has a viperous heart.

127
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:12,759
(It's ridiculous.)

128
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:14,560
(The indecency of this young master)

129
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,720
(is just like his father.)

130
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,800
(Over these years,)

131
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,879
(it's been hard for Madam.)

132
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:19,959
Spending all her time...

133
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:20,519
Kneel properly.

134
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,160
Just the antics of clowns.

135
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,560
She should see where she is.

136
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,839
No place for her little games.

137
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:27,519
She thinks no one can handle her.

138
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:29,800
You've suffered great injustice.

139
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:31,120
These few days,

140
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,680
you'll stay here.

141
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,240
I would like to see

142
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:36,879
who dares to look for trouble.

143
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:38,279
She should get lost.

144
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:39,240
Just a lowly concubine.

145
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,560
Thank you, Mr. Guan.

146
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,079
How dare she do this here!

147
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,720
(Shen Muling,)

148
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:43,839
Exactly.

149
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:46,399
(do you think you can avenge Lanyu)

150
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,959
(by relying on this prodigal?)

151
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:48,800
What filthy methods.

152
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,120
(Let's see where you end up in the end.)

153
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,879
Miss Shen.

154
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:28,720
Someone's outside.

155
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,360
When acting,

156
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,320
it has to be convincing.

157
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,399
The two of us

158
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:04,960
are entangled now.

159
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,559
Master used to

160
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:28,639
enjoy having a drink alone

161
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,799
in the courtyard.

162
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:39,480
Miss Shen,

163
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,279
tell me about my mother.

164
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:50,200
Higher.

165
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,440
Straight.

166
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,679
(Master often told me,
character is not in others' eyes.)

167
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:05,840
- The more they despise you,
(- But in one's own heart.)

168
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,200
the more you should respect yourself.

169
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,240
(Being too rigid)

170
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:09,200
Understood.

171
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,360
(will make you suffer.)

172
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,639
Thank you.

173
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,039
Thank you for staying with her

174
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,360
for all these years.

175
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:33,080
Since childhood,

176
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,360
Master had always protected me.

177
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,200
But now,

178
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:42,399
there is no one to protect me.

179
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:51,879
Don't cry.

180
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,159
I will protect you.

181
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:30,519
Get some sleep.

182
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:32,559
I'll guard you outside.

183
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,480
Master!

184
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:58,159
Master!

185
00:11:58,159 --> 00:11:59,200
What's wrong, Master?

186
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:00,799
Master.

187
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:02,679
Open your eyes.

188
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:03,879
What happened?

189
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:04,639
Master.

190
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,519
Master!

191
00:12:08,902 --> 00:12:11,904
(Lanyu)

192
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,720
Master!

193
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:50,960
Liang Man.

194
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,360
We should have killed
Shen Muling back then too.

195
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:43,679
Look how I've been tormented.

196
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,440
Be gentle.

197
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:56,840
Second Master.

198
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,279
Don't you feel sorry for me?

199
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,519
If you let that little wench
have her way,

200
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,840
I'll get ruined sooner or later.

201
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,120
Don't mind her.

202
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,080
Look at this.

203
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:10,399
I thought this bead

204
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,879
was lost in Lanyu's room that night.

205
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:13,799
Where did you get it?

206
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,120
It's almost exactly the same.

207
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:21,240
Second Master,

208
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,480
I know you are good to me.

209
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,080
Otherwise,

210
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:28,399
you wouldn't have
gotten me out of the theater

211
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:31,240
and into the Guan family

212
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,759
to enjoy this wealth and status.

213
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,759
But I just can't stand

214
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:36,320
that old woman.

215
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,240
Will you take me away?

216
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:40,799
Wait a little longer.

217
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,320
The Guan family is about to change.

218
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,720
By then,

219
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:47,279
you can do everything

220
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:49,759
as you wish.

221
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:52,120
