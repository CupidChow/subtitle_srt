- Why is he here?

Good!

56
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,040
I started opera training
at the age of three.

57
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:35,319
From the day I became an apprentice,

58
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:36,560
I vowed silently

59
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:39,759
to spread our ancestors'
artistic legacy.

60
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,000
What I did over these years

61
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,879
may not have been flawless,

62
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:46,879
but my conscience is clear.

63
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,319
Today,

00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:56,800

66
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,040
From now on,

67
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,920
I won't

68
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:07,959

93
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,360
Just leave!

94
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:50,360

95
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,439

102
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,839
people still feel nothing at all,

103
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:18,079

we won't let them return alive.

131
