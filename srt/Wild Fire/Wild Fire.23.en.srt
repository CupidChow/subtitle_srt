Muling.

47
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:18,240
Where is the bracelet?

00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,480
I...

49
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,639
It's Miss Xu.

50
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,079
Where's Muling?

51
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,680
Xingkai.

52
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:37,199
Ceremony's finished.

53
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,240
Now I'm your lawful wife!

54
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:40,759
Let me make this clear.

55
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:42,240
My wife can only be Shen Muling.

56
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:45,560
Xingkai.

57
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:46,279
Stop!

58
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,240
Where are you going?

59
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:51,720
Mother.

60
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:53,560
You never

61
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,319
want me to marry Muling, right?

62
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:57,839
Why did you do this?

63
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,600
Where's Muling?

64
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,000
She's where she's supposed to be.

65
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,800
An actress.

66
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:10,600
Does she think
she can marry into the Guan family?

67
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,480
So back then,

68
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,920
my birth mother Lanyu

69
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,560
was treated the same way?

70
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,480
Did her death

71
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,720
have anything to do with you?

72
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:31,879
Xingkai.

73
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,720
All these years,

74
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:35,879
I've treated you as my own.

75
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,079
Everything I've done

76
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:39,800
has been for your sake,

77
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,000
for the Guan family.

78
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:43,920
But I never imagined

79
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:46,600
you'd distrust me like this.

80
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,560
You've truly chilled my heart.

81
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,920
For the family? For me?

82
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,439
So from the very start,

83
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:59,480
you only cared about your position
as the matriarch.

84
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,199
I hate myself

85
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,240
for not seeing through you earlier.

86
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:14,079
Where's Shen Muling?

87
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,720
How could he do this?

88
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:32,360
Young Master!

89
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,560
Mother, what should we do?

90
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,160
What if Xingkai finds out
Shen Muling was...

91
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:38,000
Go after.

92
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:38,920
Yes.

93
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,120
Remember, we've done nothing.

94
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:53,519
That Ruyi Theater

95
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:55,199
and everyone in it

96
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,360
should've been reduced
to rubble long ago.

97
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:03,120
Young Master!

98
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,720
What's happening?

99
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:08,680
No idea.

100
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,720
Isn't that the groom?

101
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,720
Why is the groom fleeing?

102
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,800
What's going on?

103
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
What do we do?

104
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,319
Quick!

105
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,839
Move aside!

106
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:23,519
Mr. Guan!

107
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:25,160
Muling!

108
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:29,240
It's dangerous!

109
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,000
Don't go in!

110
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,440
Muling!

111
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:50,639
Muling!

112
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:58,960
Muling.

113
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,200
Muling.

114
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,360
Muling!

115
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,279
Muling, hold on!

116
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,639
I'll get you out.

117
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:27,399
Xingkai!

118
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:38,440
Xingkai.

119
00:09:38,848 --> 00:09:40,096
- Xingkai...
- Muling...

120
00:09:43,328 --> 00:09:44,128
Go quickly!

121
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,120
- Go now.
- No.

122
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,440
- Go!
- No!

123
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:51,639
Get out!

124
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:53,600
I'm not leaving.

125
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:55,639
- Run!
- I won't go!

126
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:57,240
Xingkai?

127
00:09:58,039 --> 00:09:58,919
Xingkai.

128
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,480
- Xingkai!
- Escape now!

129
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm staying with you.

130
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,264
Xingkai.

131
00:10:19,264 --> 00:10:22,200
Xingkai, wake up!

132
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:24,360
Xingkai!

133
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:28,799
Xingkai, wake up!

134
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,600
Open your eyes!

135
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,600
Wake up, Xingkai!

136
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:44,279
Xingkai.

137
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,600
The fire's too intense!

138
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,480
Young Master!

139
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:18,559
Fight the fire!

140
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,960
Lieutenant Zhang,
get men to fight the fire!

141
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:23,279
Fight the fire!

142
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:25,279
Quick!

143
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:39,720
Hurry and fight the fire!

144
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,799
Watch out!

145
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,360
Young Master!

146
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:43,840
Help!

147
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,279
Fight the fire!

148
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:47,600
Quick, fight the fire!

149
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,879
Why are you all standing around?

150
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:55,519
Extra! Extra!

151
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,360
Young Master Guan
and Ruyi Theater's Miss Shen

152
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,759
perished in blaze on their wedding day!

153
00:12:01,789 --> 00:12:04,800
(Half a month later)

154
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,159
Mother.

155
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,600
Though we're still in mourning,

156
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,399
we must celebrate your birthday.

157
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,440
Xingkai passed away.

158
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,600
I'll fulfill his filial duties.

159
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:22,200
I've consulted our elders.

160
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:24,519
We'll invite close family and friends

161
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:25,799
for a modest gathering

162
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,159
to bring comfort.

163
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,120
Qingqing.

164
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:33,159
You're such a good girl.

165
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,120
Now it's just the two of us

166
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,279
facing the world together.

167
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,600
But this burdens you unfairly.

168
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:43,399
Commander Xu is here.

169
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:46,879
Mother, look.

170
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:48,639
My brother and my family

171
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:49,600
are both backing us up.

172
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:51,320
We're all family.

173
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:57,080
Go.

174
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:05,960
Xu Qingqing.

175
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,279
You're utterly hopeless!

176
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:23,320
Shen Muling, widow of Guan Xingkai,
has come to pay respects.

177
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:25,840
Wasn't she dead?

178
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,399
Exactly.

179
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,240
Isn't this...?

180
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,159
Shen Muling?

181
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,879
Why are you alive?

182
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,960
I was Guan Xingkai's
lawfully wedded wife.

183
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,600
As your daughter-in-law,

184
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,080
no matter how hard it is,

185
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,000
I'd still come
to celebrate your birthday.

186
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,679
Here's your birthday gift.

187
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,799
What is she

188
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:04,559
