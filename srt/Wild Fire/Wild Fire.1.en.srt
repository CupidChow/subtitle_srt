=Episode 1=

14
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,519
(Tonight, a fire at Ruyi Opera Troupe)

15
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:14,040
(shocked the Rong City.)

16
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:15,000
Fire!

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,359
(The once-famous leading lady
Lanyu perished in the fire.)

18
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:23,359
(The culprit is
the disciple Shen Muling.)

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,920
(She claims it wasn't her doing,)

20
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,799
(but she has no way to justify herself.)

21
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:38,799
Master!

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,319
Senior, what on earth happened?

23
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,480
Shen Muling.

24
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:49,640
You ungrateful savage.

25
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,640
Officer,

26
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,159
it's her.

27
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,200
- Get her.
- Yes.

28
00:02:01,984 --> 00:02:05,024
(Shen Muling, Ruyi Opera Troupe)

29
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:07,519
Before going on stage,

30
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:10,039
(Senior Sister, Liang Man)
I heard She had a fight with Master.

31
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,000
Soon after, the theater caught fire

32
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,800
and Master's courtyard was burned down.

33
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:18,520
If she weren't the culprit,

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,199
who else could it be?

35
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:24,159
Junior.

36
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:27,080
It seems

37
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:30,680
it's not the troupe you are craving,

38
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,560
but the position of the head

39
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,599
of this troupe.

40
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,840
The leading lady of Ruyi Opera Troupe,
Shen Muling,

41
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:42,599
is suspected of arson and murder.

42
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:44,256
Take her away.

43
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:57,400
Miss Shen.

44
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,560
Do you confess?

45
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:01,800
I told you,

46
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,680
it wasn't me.

47
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,879
It wasn't me!

48
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,439
Then who is it?

49
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,039
Mr. Guan,

50
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,719
you just returned from abroad,

51
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:12,039
so you may not know

52
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,479
that the one next door

53
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:14,919
is courted

54
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,199
by many wealthy young men

55
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:20,479
in the city of Rong.

56
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,599
Well,

57
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,000
if you fancy her,

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,960
we can...

59
00:03:33,894 --> 00:03:35,520
(Young Master Guan, Guan Xingkai)

60
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,159
Well,

61
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:37,840
I'll take her.

62
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:40,639
Mr. Guan...

63
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,439
Please, Chief Su.

64
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,479
Sure thing.

65
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:49,159
It's my duty.

66
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:49,800
Well,

67
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,360
does the young master fancy Miss Shen?

68
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:54,879
Inquiring about the young master?

69
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:57,520
You're bold.

70
00:03:59,199 --> 00:03:59,520
Sorry.

71
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:04,120
What a snobbish lackey.

72
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,199
None of Guan family is any good.

73
00:04:07,168 --> 00:04:08,680
(Rong City Police Department)
News!

74
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,360
Master Guan Hanyang from the Guan family

75
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,159
will soon marry the actress Liang Man.

76
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:13,680
Newspapers!

77
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:16,040
You are Miss Shen.

78
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:17,680
How did you get out?

79
00:04:21,664 --> 00:04:26,080
(Master Guan Hanyang
will soon marry actress Liang Man)

80
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:41,959
Drive.

81
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:42,879
Yes.

82
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,319
I doubt if Miss Shen can stay
in this city any longer.

83
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,879
Stop, Shen Muling.

84
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,120
You murdered Master.

85
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:05,920
You think you can come back here?

86
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,959
It hasn't been clarified yet.

87
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,040
You are already convicting me.

88
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,360
Why bother?

89
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,240
Get out.

90
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:17,680
Get out of the theater.

91
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:38,160
The opera troupe is quite lively today.

92
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:40,079
But today,

93
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,079
not only do I want her back here,

94
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,399
but I also want her to be the head.

95
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,319
Who...

96
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,480
Don't provoke him

97
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:50,920
if you still want to live.

98
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:55,720
Come.

99
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,639
They think they rule this place.

100
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:10,360
(It seems I came out alive)

101
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,439
(because of Guan Xingkai.)

102
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:13,800
(But what is he plotting for?)

103
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:15,839
Being able to meet Miss Shen

104
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,040
is indeed an honor for me.

105
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:27,319
Times have changed.

106
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:28,800
Thank you, Mr. Guan.

107
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:29,879
Have some tea.

108
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,639
Miss Shen does assess
the situation accurately.

109
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:47,959
Pouring tea is boring.

110
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:50,079
Can you do anything else?

111
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:55,160
I've been thinking,

112
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,000
as an actress

113
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,360
suspected of killing my master,

114
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:01,759
how did I survive till now?

115
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,480
You mean...

116
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:07,560
Someone must have been helping me.

117
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,800
And it'd be the first one I met

118
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,839
when I got back,

119
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,279
you.

120
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,600
So,

121
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,839
how do you plan to repay me?

122
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:30,160
Since you put in

123
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,680
so much effort for me,

124
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:33,519
I must be of use to you,

125
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,079
I suppose.

126
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:42,959
Three days later,
at the Guan family's banquet,

127
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:45,439
I would like to invite you to perform.

128
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,319
Mr. Guan.

129
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,360
If I say I've long admired you,

130
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,160
will you believe me?

131
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,199
I'm just an actress.

132
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,319
Don't joke about me.

133
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,879
I am here to help you.

134
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,600
But what you owe me

135
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,399
must be repaid.

136
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:06,399
After going through all this,

137
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,399
you are still so composed.

138
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,120
It's very impressive.

139
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:17,279
See you.

140
00:08:24,806 --> 00:08:27,936
(Three days later, Guan's Residence)

141
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,440
Shen Muling?

142
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:59,399
Didn't she kill Lanyu?

143
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,519
Why is she out of the jail now?

144
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:03,879
Can't you see?

145
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:05,440
She's latched onto Mr. Guan.

146
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,159
Actresses,

147
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:09,039
after all, are low-class people.

148
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,360
Those virtues

149
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,240
were all acts.

150
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,639
This Mr. Guan is absurd.

151
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:15,720
But at best,

152
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:17,679
she can only be a mistress.

153
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:20,320
No wonder Xingkai is the child
of elder brother and that person.

154
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,919
He's very much like my brother.

155
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:23,320
I remember,

156
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:28,080
(Guan Qingyang, second master of the Guan family)
my brother was also infatuated with actresses.

157
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:30,320
(Madam Wen, matron of the Guan family)
Second Master, watch your words.

158
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,080
Oh.

159
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,320
Xingkai is here.

160
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:36,960
Have a seat.

161
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:39,039
What are you talking about?

162
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:40,159
It seems fun.

163
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,200
Nothing much.

164
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:43,960
You, however,

165
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,559
are the eldest young master
of this family.

166
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:47,840
Your way of life now

167
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:48,720
won't do.

168
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:50,279
Mother,

169
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:51,720
rest assured.

170
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:54,399
I won't let those with ill intentions

171
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:55,559
have their way.

172
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:57,000
Look.

173
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,600
Xingkai is a promising kid.

174
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:04,039
(Why isn't Shen Muling singing?)

175
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:05,320
(Where is she?)

176
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,000
You are very lucky, Madam.

177
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:22,320
The young master

178
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,200
invited an opera troupe today.

179
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:24,919
Opera troupe?

180
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,559
Which one?

181
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:28,159
The Ruyi Opera Troupe you were in,

182
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:29,600
with Shen Muling.

183
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,440
How dare you!

184
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,000
What are you dazing for?
Go get a new one.

185
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:38,039
Yes.

186
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,559
And you,

187
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:40,200
get out!

188
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:40,679
Yes.

189
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:45,320
How could it be her?

190
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:48,120
She's still alive?

191
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:50,200
How is that possible?

192
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,919
How dare she come to the Guan family!

193
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:01,360
Senior.

194
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,080
Long time no see.

195
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:05,279
Why are you so surprised?

196
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:06,919
What?

197
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:09,360
Don't want to see me
on your wedding day?

198
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:12,440
Or do you feel guilty about something?

199
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,279
Speak.

200
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,320
Did you really see me kill Master?

201
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,240
During the fire,

202
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,960
only you and Master were in the room.

203
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,200
Many people

204
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,960
were watching.

205
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,559
Junior.

206
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:29,279
For fame and fortune,

207
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:31,559
you were heartless enough

208
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:33,000
to kill your own master.

209
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:35,679
You are truly ruthless.

210
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:38,399
Help!

211
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,320
Guards!

212
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:40,279
What's wrong?

213
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:40,960
Listen.

214
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,120
Let's take a look.

215
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,360
If I find out it was your doing,

216
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:46,360
I will show you

217
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:49,360
what ruthlessness is.

218
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,080
Where is she?
She disappeared.

219
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:03,440
Go over there.

220
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:03,919
Yes.

221
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:11,720
You're really bold.

222
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:12,799
Why are you here?

223
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,679
If I remember correctly,

224
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,320
the stage isn't
in the second concubine's room.

225
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,736
What are you doing?

226
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,240
It's really here.

227
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:42,720
Master's jade pendant.

228
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:45,216
Why do you have the other half?

229
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,519
Lanyu is my mother.

230
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,879
Do you understand now

231
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:52,960
why I have the other half?
