00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,000
Master Liu?

16
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:18,159
Right.

17
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,959
He is a master playwright.

18
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,079
I want to invite him

19
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,319
write a play based on Yuan's story.

20
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,120
But you know,

21
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,359
he's put down his pen.

22
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,480
He and I are old friends.

what you want,

25
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:35,120
we'll try.

28
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,200
Fitting for the rumor of our elopement.

29
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:52,239
Okay?

30
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:53,560
Okay.

(Guan)
It's chilly at night.

32
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:05,280
Wear more.

33
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:10,479
Go back.

34
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:10,840
Qingyang,

35
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:13,000
we'll take our leave first.

36
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,639
Second Master, you go ahead.

37
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:15,080
Okay.

38
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,000
Take care.

39
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:17,000
Go.

40
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:18,280
Go.

41
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:22,759
The major families already know

42
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,039
you'll surely take over the Guan family.

43
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,680
Congrats.

44
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,240
It's well deserved.

45
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,319
Just hope

46
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:35,199
the ones inside

aren't still in the dark.

Recently,

49
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,280
have you heard any news?

50
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,360
That night,

51
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,520
Granduncle heard the news

52
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,240
and fell ill in anger.

53
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:52,319
Fourth Madam's been cursing nonstop.

54
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:54,319
And

55
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,719
I heard something.

56
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:58,840
Say.

57
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:03,080
Madam killed Master.

58
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,680
What?

59
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:10,879
Sir.

60
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:12,120
It's true.

Xingkai

65
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,120
is not at home.

66
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:13,319
You've lost weight.

67
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,360
Thank you for caring about us.

68
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,199
It is

69
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,600
so kind of you.

70
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,639
I know you're busy.

71
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:23,759
I shall leave.

72
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:26,000
I saw you returned from East Port.

73
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,240
You went out?

147
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:37,600
so they called me.

148
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,320
I was thinking

149
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,240
there must be a traitor inside.

151
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,840

Seal off this place.

Right?

Stop pretending!

164
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,159
You just want to seize power

165
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:11,080
while Xingkai's away.

166
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,879
Sister, don't talk nonsense.

167
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:14,960

172
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,480
burn your hands?

175
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,879
your position won't change.

176

180
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,039
as before.

00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:03,679

Mother.

183
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:06,720

00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,039
I heard Xingkai is back.
I'll go see him.

200
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:46,679
Wait.

201
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,240
Okay.

202
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,799
Take her back.

203
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,039
Why?

204
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,120
Miss.

205
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,200
Hey!

206
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,200
Xu Yanshu, why?

207
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:53,559
Miss.

208
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:54,799
Xu Yanshu!

209
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:56,360
Miss. Come on.

210
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,240
Why won't he let me go?

211
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:02,600
Miss.

212
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:04,039
Just listen to him.

213
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:04,559
Go back.

214
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:05,759
You follow

215
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:06,440
all his orders?

216
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,320
That's

217
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:07,960
true.

218
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:09,360
Miss, please.

219
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,320
Unreasonable.

220
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,440
You have to tell me why.

221
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,360
Just stay in the room.

222
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,679
Alright.

223
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,320
Second Master.

224
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,039
Uncle.

225
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,360
Remember her?

226
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,120
When you sent people to kill me,

227
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,279
you probably didn't expect this day.

228
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:51,639
Xingkai.

229
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:52,919
What's going on here?

230
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,360
Liang Man? Wasn't she dead?

231
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,039
My senior faked her death

232
00:11:58,039 --> 00:11:59,120
to escape.

233
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:01,080
Otherwise, how could she

234
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,080
expose you today?

235
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,399
Murder!

236
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,399
Shen Muling wants to kill me!

237
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,120
Senior, listen to me.

238
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:10,519
Second Master wants to poison you.

239
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:12,159
I will find a way to help you.

240
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,120
Everyone, you may not know.

241
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,159
This seemingly kind

242
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:27,360
Second Master

243
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,360
is actually

244
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,399
a ruthless killer.

245
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,799
Nonsense!

246
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,840
You set up a trap

247
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,279
to frame me, huh?

248
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,039
Where's your proof?

249
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,480
Chunsheng.

250
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:43,840
Here.

251
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,320
Uncle.

252
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:50,879
Do you recognize him?

253
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,919
You double-crosser.

254
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,120
Second Master.

255
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:00,559
I was loyal to you.

256
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,679
But you used me

257
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:05,879
and even poisoned my brother.

258
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,759
Not only that,

259
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:10,720
he also burned Lanyu alive

260
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,679
for the family seal.

261
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:17,759
And

262
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:20,879
Master.

263
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:24,080
You also killed Master.

264
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,759
Me?

265
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,159
Alright.

266
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:46,360
So what?

267
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:48,399
He deserved it.

268
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,159
What has he

269
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:51,399
ever done for the family?

270
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:55,600
It's me who make Guan family prosperous!

271
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:57,440
Without me,

272
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,519
you're nobody!

273
00:13:58,519 --> 00:13:59,720
Who do you think you are?

274
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,360
A prestigious family?

275
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:04,440
Dream on!

276
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,279
You say it's all for the family.

277
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,559
Then what's this?

278
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:33,679
Opium.

279
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:36,759
You dare to mix opium in our medicine?

280
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,919
How could he?

281
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:40,519
Exactly.

282
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:42,000
Guan Xingkai.

283
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,480
Impressive.

284
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,519
Uncle.

285
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,759
If there's anything else,

286
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,600
go explain it at the police station.

287
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,879
- What is this?
- Don't move!

288
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:00,799
Let go of me.

289
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:02,240
Guan Xingkai.

290
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,480
You put on quite a show.

291
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:05,000
Great!

292
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,840
Put in quite some effort.

293
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:09,279
I developed the Guan family.

294
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:11,080
Now you want to throw me in jail

295
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,200
and take everything?

296
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:14,159
Don't forget I am your uncle.

297
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:15,240
I am the Second Master!

298
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,240
Second Master?

299
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:17,720
Don't forget,

300
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,120
anyone who betrays the family

301
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,080
will be removed from the family tree.

302
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,679
The Guan family

303
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,600
won't protect you anymore.

304
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:29,480
Guan Xingkai!

305
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:30,799
Let go of me!

306
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,600
Just wait, Guan Xingkai.

307
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,159
Just you wait!

308
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,440
Guan Xingkai!

309
00:15:58,279 --> 00:15:59,159
Cheers.

310
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:05,360
You've lost weight.

311
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,120
Eat more meat.

312
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,360
Thanks.

313
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:08,759
Qingqing.

314
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:09,240
Yes.

315
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:09,440
Here.

316
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,080
You eat too.

317
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:11,960
Thank you.

318
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:15,720
When you were not home,

319
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,639
Qingqing kept me company.

320
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,639
Days ago,

321
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:20,919
I've discussed with Xu family.

322
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,840
The wedding is imminent.

323
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,600
Settle down

324
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,759
and prepare for it, okay?

325
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,639
I'll take it as a yes.

326
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:34,879
Mother.

327
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:36,600
I'll marry.

328
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:39,279
Good. Nice.

329
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:40,720
But not marry Miss Xu.

330
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:45,080
Xingkai.

331
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:47,080
What do you mean?

332
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,919
If not me,

333
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:50,000
then who?

334
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,039
I want to marry

335
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:55,519
Shen Muling.

336
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,320
What?

337
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:56,600
You...

338
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,039
Xingkai.

339
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,399
You've lost your mind.

340
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,919
How can you marry an actress?

341
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,480
That'll ruin our family name!

342
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:03,360
You!

343
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:06,039
Madam.

344
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:06,720
Madam.

345
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,039
Ma'am.

346
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,559
Shen Muling.
