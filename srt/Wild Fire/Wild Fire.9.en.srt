Don't worry.

This place is our place.

17

At night, I'll pick you up.

18
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:27,360
Go by boat.

19
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:35,799
Xingkai, I've been exposed.

20
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:38,760
I'm afraid I can't go back to Jiangbei.

21
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:41,120
But there's still work

22
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,120
to be done there.

23
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:45,040
We've worked together for years.
I trust you.

24
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,040
Didn't you always want

25
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,120
to go the frontline?

26
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,159
Now's your chance.

27
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:55,000
Mr. Zhang.

28
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,200
Those are all jokes.

29
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:58,599
Not serious.

30
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,000
Are you worried about your identity?

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'll send a telegram now.

32
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:07,400
From now on, you'll handle

33
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:08,599
all Jiangbei affairs.

34
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,520
From now on, you are Wildfire.

35
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:13,039
Zhang Ye, I'm a businessman,

36
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,280
not a saint.

37
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:16,520
We can work together,

38
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:18,120
but nothing more.

39
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,159
Fine. For safety,

40
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:25,240
everything happened here today,

41
00:02:25,536 --> 00:02:26,720
- not a word...
- Don't worry.

42
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:28,159
I won't say a single word.

43
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,960
- Take care.
- Okay.

44
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:37,039
Send more people. Watch closely.

45
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,719
Come on, beat them!

46
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,439
Yes.

47
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,400
Who dare?

48
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:26,840
Mr. Zhang, I don't want to see anyone
but Miss Shen today.

49
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,080
Did you hear it? The place is reserved.

50
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,400
Anyone who stays

51
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,280
gets a bullet.

52
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,439
Go.

53
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:37,719
Hurry up.

54
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,800
Shen Muling.

55
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,319
Today, I'll let this go today
for Commander Xu's sake.

56
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:46,919
But this isn't over.

57
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:47,879
Half a month.

58
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,439
Apologize in person within half a month.

59
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:53,520
Or forget about the trade meeting.

60
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:59,280
Honey! So many people.

61
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:00,680
Honey!

62
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:01,800
Are you okay?

63
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,039
Thank you.

64
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,919
There are plenty of good men.

65
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:11,400
He's not worth it.

66
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,400
Look what he's done to you.

67
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,960
What's so good about him, Yuan?

68
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,879
Miss Shen, don't worry.

69
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,879
I was just passing by on duty.

70
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:24,800
Lucky for you

71
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:26,120
that I passed by.

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,399
Otherwise, your theater

73
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,360
would be smashed again.

74
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:32,959
So you admit

75
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,680
your men overstepped

76
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,800
last time?

77
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,439
Looks like Mr. Guan
doesn't care much for you.

78
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,639
None of your concern.

79
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:44,800
See yourself out.

80
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,720
Yuan, come down!

81
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,839
Don't do anything rash!

82
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,680
- Right!
- Come down!

83
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,519
Come down.

84
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,759
What are you doing, Yuan?

85
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:01,600
Come down!

86
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,360
I'm sorry, senior.

87
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,079
I dragged you

88
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:07,519
Mr. Guan,

89
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,439
and the whole theater down.

90
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,560
I'll atone with my life.

91
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,519
Nonsense!

92
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:17,920
Do you remember

93
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,399
what you said kneeling before master?

94
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:22,639
You said you'd be a lead.

95
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:25,480
You trained through freezing winters
and hot summers.

96
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,879
You suffered so much.

97
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:27,839
Was it all just for him?

98
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,120
It was for yourself!

99
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,000
Don't you feel sorry for yourself?

100
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,040
Yuan, listen to me.

101
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,120
Come down first.

102
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,680
Don't worry, I'm here.

103
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:43,600
I won't let your suffering
be for nothing.

104
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:46,439
If heaven doesn't give you justice,

105
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,480
I will.

106
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,000
But,

107
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:54,879
even if I get justice, what's the use?

108
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,360
I've already lost everything.

109
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:00,639
Senior.

110
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,920
It hurts.

111
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,360
I'm sorry.

112
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,360
I'll repay you and master's kindness

113
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,800
in the next life.

114
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,639
Yuan!

115
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:19,480
If you really feel sorry for her,

116
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,560
you shouldn't die here.

117
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,720
If this gets out,

118
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,120
how will the theater survive?

119
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,639
What are you doing?

120
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:29,839
If you don't want her to die,

121
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:31,519
trust me.

122
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:35,759
Jump.

123
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,240
Jump.

124
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:42,759
Why stop?

125
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:46,519
Go ahead.

126
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:52,319
That's right.

127
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,600
Yuan, if you jump down today,

128
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:58,040
I'll put your ashes in a jar tomorrow

129
00:06:58,519 --> 00:06:59,456
and go to Jin Mansion.

130
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,920
I will go to apologize.

131
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:12,639
Yuan.

132
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,360
Yuan.

133
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:20,439
Yuan.

134
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,639
Are you okay?

135
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:26,639
Senior.

136
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:27,920
It's okay now.

137
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,360
I'm here.

138
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,839
You silly girl.

139
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,959
Let's go back inside, okay?

140
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:36,600
Are you hurt?

141
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,279
Come on, can you stand?

142
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,439
Let's go.

143
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,136
Take it slow.

144
00:07:58,942 --> 00:08:02,056
(To Jin Ping and Madam Jin
by Guan Xingkai)

145
00:08:06,595 --> 00:08:08,975
(An invitation to Mr. Jin
and Madam Jin to the gathering)

146
00:08:08,975 --> 00:08:10,720
(hold by Guan Xingkai and Miss Shen.)

147
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,240
When is your wedding date?

148
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:43,039
You know I have no feelings for her,

149
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:45,200
but still insists on matchmaking.

150
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,159
Don't you care about her happiness?

151
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,039
I promised her before.

152
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,519
I'll help her get

153
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,759
anything she wants.

154
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:06,559
This time, Miss Xu will be disappointed.

155
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:14,840
No poison?

156
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,669
(Guan Xingkai, the goods' departed.)

157
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,480
Bluffing.

158
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,759
Believe it or not, it's up to you.

159
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,440
From now on, I suggest you

160
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,080
stay away

161
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,000
from my goods and my woman.

162
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,600
Young Master, your plan

163
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,240
is truly impressive.

164
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,200
Newspapers!

166
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:01,440
It's cut off.

167
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,519
Boy, come here.

168
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:03,296
One, please.

169
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,279
Flowers!

170
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,799
Newspapers!

172
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:13,159
It's cut off.

173

Young Master.

Jiangbei is invaded by a storm.

175
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,919
(Rongcheng Times)
It's cut off.

176
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:25,039
We've bought some time,

177
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,720
but the trade gathering must go on.

178
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,039
The escaping trick

179
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,759
takes timing.

180
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:31,960
If it's late,

181
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,240
we'll die.

182
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:36,639
But the gathering is disrupted.

183
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:38,200
I'm afraid...

184
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,480
By the way, how are Yuan and Miss Shen?

185
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:44,120
They're fine.

186
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:45,919
Doctor prescribed medicine.

187
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,080
Yuan'll recover

188
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,080
after a month's rest without stress.

189
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:51,879
Miss Shen?

190
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,120
In such a hurry?

191
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:55,960
Who are you?

192
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:57,248
What do you want?

193
00:11:58,279 --> 00:11:59,039
Put me down.

194
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:00,759
Miss Shen.

195
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:02,240
A life for a life.

196
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:03,919
Your death is fair.

197
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,480
Bai Xiaodi?

198
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:07,080
Aren't you already dead?

199
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,960
Shut up. That was my brother.

200
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,759
Shen Muling.

201
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,440
You and Guan Xingkai
searched so hard for me.

202
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,360
And now

203
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,799
you'll die by my hand.

204
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,360
Karma.

205
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:23,960
This is your karma
for killing my brother.

206
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,200
You fired at the theater that day!

207
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:37,840
What's that look?

208
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:40,480
Don't even know who's really behind it.

209
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:42,360
Find someone at random to kill.

210
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,600
You're really stupid.

211
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,759
Go ahead. Laugh while you still can.

212
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,200
Her life, I'll repay.

213
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:12,919
Xingkai.

214
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,360
Stop! Take one more step

215
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,519
and I'll cut the rope.

216
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,240
It's me who sent your brother

217
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:24,799
into the station.

218
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,360
If anyone should die, it's me.

219
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:30,320
Let her go.

220
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,600
Take me instead.

221
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,360
What are you doing?

222
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,799
I've told you.

223
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,879
We didn't kill your brother!

224
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:40,679
Didn't you hear it?

225
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:47,120
Heard the Guan family
raised a fool in love.

226
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,159
I didn't expect it to be true.

227
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:58,320
Work for your enemy.

228
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,960
Don't even know the killer.

229
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,799
Take revenge?

230
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:01,792
Chunsheng.

231
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,879
What do you mean?

232
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,919
Work for enemy?

233
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,679
You still don't get it?

234
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:11,104
Chunsheng.

235
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,200
Watch out!

236
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:26,759
Xingkai.

237
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,519
Muling, hold on.

238
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:32,360
I will save you.
