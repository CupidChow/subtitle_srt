14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,799
Ma'am,

15
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:16,920
is this one better?

16
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,079
This one.

17
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:19,959
This one is the best.

18
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:22,319
This is a bit big.

19
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:22,959
See.

20
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:24,160
- Right?
- Try it on.

21
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,359
Okay.

22
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,519
These two are good.

23
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:28,400
Pick one.

24
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,719
Pick one you like.

25
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:32,040
I still prefer this one.

26
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:33,640
How about it?

27
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,359
Great.

28
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,439
Pretty.

29
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,079
Xingkai.

30
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,040
Xingkai.

31
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:42,400
At this moment,

32
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,239
where are you going?

33
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,000
Let go.

34
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:48,239
Xingkai.

35
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:50,799
Don't forget what you promised me.

36
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:55,280
I said, let go.

37
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:08,039
Don't worry.

38
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:09,439
I'm here.

39
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:17,080
Commander, if you insist,

40
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,039
then go ahead.

41
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:21,600
Come on.

42
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:34,719
I just want

43
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:37,159
to give you a way out.

44
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,680
Or you may find

45
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:44,719
nowhere to go.

46
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:47,280
Thank you, Commander.

47
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,039
If that's all,

48
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,319
please leave.

49
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,520
You've got some guts.

50
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:58,960
Interesting.

51
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,200
I'll wait for your answer.

52
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:09,696
Who's that?

53
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:19,160
Who's that?

54
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,176
Are you okay?

55
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:34,759
I'm fine.

56
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:36,759
Why are you here?

57
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,439
I bought the theater.

58
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:39,919
Why can't I be here?

59
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,599
Commander Xu.

60
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:45,560
It's so late.

61
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,520
Want to sleep here?

62
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,000
Young Master!

63
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,576
The assassin ran away.

64
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,520
Are you okay?

65
00:03:58,599 --> 00:03:59,560
I'll handle it myself.

66
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,520
No need to trouble you.

67
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,280
Since you don't want me to intervene,

68
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:04,840
fine.

69
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,479
Don't make such a scene.

70
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,479
We're going to be family.

71
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,759
Then, this thing

72
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,199
do need settling.

73
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,240
Otherwise, people will say

74
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,199
you can't keep your men in line,

75
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,600
letting them cause trouble here.

76
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:27,240
How about this?

77
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:29,439
I'll send the damage cost

78
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,120
tomorrow to your mansion.

79
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:32,519
You!

80
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,519
Let's go.

81
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,680
It's not what you thought.

82
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,720
I can explain it to you now.

83
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:02,600
Congratulations, you find a good match.

84
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:04,399
When you get married,

85
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,240
I'll go send a wedding gift.

86
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:10,800
Let go of me.

87
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,160
So many people here!

88
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,000
Move again

89
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,519
and I'll make sure everyone sees us.

90
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,600
Muling.

91
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:28,759
I'm sorry.

92
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:32,240
I was wrong.

93
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,000
Please, believe me.

94
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:54,400
Second Master.

95
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:55,959
It was my fault.

96
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:58,519
I was injured by Guan Xingkai's men

97
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,600
chasing me.

98
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:02,040
Please punish me.

99
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:05,839
It's okay.

100
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,199
Sit.

101
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,680
Sit down.

102
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:14,600
I said sit!

103
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,360
Are your ears hurt too?

104
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,279
Here, ointment.

105
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,920
For gunshot wounds.

106
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,759
Works fast.

107
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:40,759
You two brothers.

108
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,279
It's been

109
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,560
almost five years

110
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,920
since I pulled you off that ship.

111
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,879
Now one's dead, the other's hurt.

112
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,199
It's all my fault.

113
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:53,800
I should never have let your brother go.

114
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,584
Second Master.

115
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:56,800
Don't say that.

116
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,319
You saved our lives.

117
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:02,120
Wherever you tell us to go,

118
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,079
we'll go.

119
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,879
Even if it means

120
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:06,879
walking into fire.

121
00:07:08,032 --> 00:07:08,896
If anyone's to blame,

122
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:11,120
it's that actress and...

123
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,240
These years,

124
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:16,920
you and your brother,

125
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,720
one in the light,

126
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,519
one in the dark,

127
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:22,519
helped me do a lot.

128
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:26,879
Once I take charge of the Guan family,

129
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,040
I won't forget your loyalty.

130
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,959
Thank you, Second Master.

131
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,240
Don't worry.

132
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,319
So,

133
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:08,920
the Xu family is holding your goods

134
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,879
at the bank of Jiangbei

135
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,120
to force you into marriage.

136
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,560
Jiangbei is now beset

137
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,000
by natural disasters.

138
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:18,879
The medicine

139
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,199
must get there quickly.

140
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,399
There is no room for hesitation.

141
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,240
It's not for Guan family,

142
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,399
but for all the refugees in Jiangbei.

143
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,440
In chaotic times,

144
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,279
people struggle to survive.

145
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,720
Let me help you.

146
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:52,039
When I was young,

147
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,799
my master often brought us here,

148
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,120
saying wishes made here come true.

149
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,440
But I was too young,

150
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,080
and couldn't understand

151
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:03,279
why adults always make wishes.

152
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,279
Maybe there's always something

153
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,360
people can't do

154
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:08,960
but still want to do.

155
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,440
But so what?

156
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,399
Fate isn't set in stone.

157
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:16,799
It's shaped by people.

158
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:46,240
Muling.

159
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,759
If this trade meeting goes well,

160
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:55,600
we will get a foothold

161
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,399
in Jiangbei.

162
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:57,879
No matter what,

163
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:00,480
thank you for performing for me.

164
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:02,919
You get it wrong.

165
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:04,519
I didn't perform for you,

166
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,159
nor for the Guan family.

167
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,879
I perform for those

168
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:09,559
struggling on the brink of death.

169
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:15,039
Please.

170
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,759
Zhang Ye?

171
00:10:48,896 --> 00:10:49,504
Come with me.

172
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:56,879
Look, everyone!

173
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,840
An actress's just that.

174
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,279
Shameless!

175
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,200
Seducing my husband.

176
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,480
Truly shameless!

177
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:09,960
Come.

178
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:17,679
Today's Mr. Guan's banquet.

179
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,200
I assume

180
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,519
you're both guests.

181
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,399
Isn't it disgraceful

182
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,000
to fight like this?

183
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:25,639
Disgraceful?

184
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,279
This little wench has no shame!

185
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:29,159
Clinging to my man

186
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:30,840
in front of everyone!

187
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:33,039
I was just teaching her a lesson.

188
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,879
So she knows

189
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:36,279
where to look

190
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:37,279
next time!

191
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,960
I often heard Yuan talk

192
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,879
about her man.

193
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,039
I thought he was an ambitious gentleman.

194
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,480
Turns out he's just a heartless liar.

195
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,120
What do you mean?

196
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,120
Madam,

197
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:54,200
don't ask me.

198
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:57,159
You should ask your man.

199
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,799
Jin Ping,

200
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:02,039
abandoning your wife to marry another.

201
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:04,639
Are you worthy of Yuan's

202
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,480
eight years of waiting?

203
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,320
Honey.

204
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,279
Let me explain.

205
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:10,480
Honey!

206
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:11,080
Go!

207
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:12,519
Honey!

208
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,759
I will handle my family affairs myself.

209
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:16,399
You have no right to interfere.

210
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,159
Shen Muling.

211
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,240
Today, for Mr. Guan's sake,

212
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:21,960
I'll let this go.

213
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,799
How about

214
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:26,440
you perform to make amends?

215
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,759
Here, Madam.

216
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:29,919
Perform?

217
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,879
You know it better than I do.

218
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:34,279
How about

219
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:37,240
Madame Zou's Longing?

220
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:37,720
You!

221
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:40,440
Go.

222
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,919
You has the grace for it.

223
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:45,960
I'm sure

224
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,919
you'll bring a fresh flavor to the role.

225
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,320
Don't go too far!

226
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,240
Yuan.

227
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,080
Yuan.

228
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,600
If you want filthy lines,
take the door on the left.

229
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,480
Ruyi Opera House does not host you.

230
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,960
Right. You want vulgar plays?

231
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,720
Ask me first.

232
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,159
Exactly.

233
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,360
We don't serve you.

234
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:07,799
You are not welcome.

235
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:16,080
Shen Muling.

236
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,799
Have you decided?

237
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,279
If you are unwilling,

238
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:22,559
just hand over this wench.

239
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:24,080
No way.

240
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:26,559
How ungrateful.

241
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:27,480
Someone!

242
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,240
Beat them!

243
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:28,960
Yes.

244
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,039
Who dare?

245
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:33,799
Who is that?

246
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:35,000
