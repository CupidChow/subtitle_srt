=Episode 17=

14
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,599
From what I can see,

15
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:13,000
Miss Shen is alright.

16
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,879
And her amnesia

17
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,200
is due to trauma and stimulation
to the brain,

18
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,200
leading to altered cognition

19
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:20,719
and partial memory loss.

20
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,319
That's why she
only remembers Commander Xu

21
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:24,400
but not others.

22
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:27,200
Is there any way
to restore her memories?

23
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:30,159
Regarding amnesia,

24
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,640
some recover within months,

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,519
while others

26
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,719
never regain the memories.

27
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,480
He is correct.

28
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:47,239
Well,

29
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,799
I'll prescribe medicine

30
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,319
to stabilize her.

31
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:51,560
Thank you.

32
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:06,120
Yanshu,

33
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:07,760
can you take me home?

34
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,560
Go home?

35
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:12,120
I'm scared here.

36
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:14,280
Liusu,

37
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,319
pack up.

38
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,082
Let's go.

39
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:25,759
Stop.

40
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,840
She was injured under your roof.

41
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:32,719
Without an explanation today,

42
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:34,840
no one leaves.

43
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:36,719
The break-in

44
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,639
at my mansion was my oversight.

45
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,360
I'll find the culprit soon
and give Muling

46
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:44,599
proper closure.

47
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,159
A break-in at your mansion?

48
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:49,599
That's your excuse?

49
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,599
Or actually,

50
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,800
you know the real culprit

51
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,639
and want to protect her?

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,960
I trust Yanshu.

53
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,479
Sir,

54
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:05,319
please stay out of our affairs.

55
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:08,520
Old feelings die hard, Mr. Guan?

56
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,120
Since they're old feelings,

57
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,039
leave them behind.

58
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:15,080
You have no right to meddle.

59
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:16,479
Please step aside.

60
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,240
You don't remember me?

61
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,439
(I'm sorry, Mr. Guan.)

62
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:39,960
(I must stay.)

63
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:42,120
(Yuan died because of me.)

64
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:43,800
(I must)

65
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:46,240
(avenge her.)

66
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:13,520
Come.

67
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:21,800
Ringing a bell?

68
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,560
I was just thinking

69
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,519
the Commander's Mansion is grand.

70
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,920
And I'm just a lowly actress.

71
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:34,120
How could I be worthy of it?

72
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,639
Stop that.

73
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:39,600
You'll be my lawfully wedded wife

74
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,639
and the rightful mistress
of this mansion.

75
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,640
Don't belittle yourself.

76
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:45,519
Come.

77
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:03,040
She lost her memory?

78
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:03,959
My lady,

79
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:06,800
could this be a trick?

80
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:09,560
My brother's softhearted.

81
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,360
But I won't keep

82
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,600
a ticking time bomb by my side.

83
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,360
Is everything ready?

84
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:16,519
Yes, my lady,

85
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:17,120
they're ready.

86
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,360
Let's go.

87
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,399
I'd like to see what schemes

88
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:22,519
this woman's hiding.

89
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:26,040
Here.

90
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:39,920
I asked Liusu

91
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,800
to make you calming herbal soup.

92
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:42,480
Try it.

93
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:55,639
It's good.

94
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,240
Alright.

95
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:58,040
Rest early after finishing.

96
00:05:59,519 --> 00:05:59,839
Thanks.

97
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:12,959
Miss Shen,

98
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,160
are you tired?

99
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:16,000
Let me help you rest.

100
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:17,920
No need.

101
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,680
Leave me alone.

102
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,759
You may go.

103
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:21,639
Yes.

104
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:22,319
Thanks.

105
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,879
Miss Shen.

106
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,720
May I ask who you are?

107
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,800
I was injured.

108
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:38,079
It makes my memories hazy.

109
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,759
This is the young lady...

110
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,199
Ying.

111
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,160
You're Yanshu's sister?

112
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,079
Please sit.

113
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:46,480
No need.

114
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:48,639
The gift.

115
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:54,759
I heard you've recently recovered.

116
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,639
I came with a gift.

117
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,759
I wonder how you feel

118
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,560
about this dress?

119
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:31,160
(It was the dress
Yuan wore before her death.)

120
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:35,480
This dress is exquisitely beautiful.

121
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:36,679
I like it very much.

122
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:38,679
Thank you, Miss Xu.

123
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,720
Shen Muling,

124
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,840
stop putting on an act with me.

125
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,000
Don't think I don't know
you're faking it.

126
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,879
Miss Xu, your misunderstanding of me

127
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:01,000
runs so deep.

128
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,720
Could it be you're afraid of something?

129
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:16,840
I won't see you out.

130
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
(Xu Qingqing,)

131
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:23,519
(I won't let you off.)

132
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,720
(Yuan,)

133
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:35,720
(I know this is dangerous,)

134
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,559
(but I must avenge you)

135
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,440
(to soothe your spirit.)

136
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,960
(But some details remain suspicious)

137
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:45,759
(that I can't figure out.)

138
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,279
(You barely knew Xu Qingqing.)

139
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:50,759
(You had no grudges.)

140
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,159
(She had no reason to kill you.)

141
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,440
(I was the real target
of her drugging attempt.)

142
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,480
(So)

143
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,840
(you must've run into something.)

144
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,000
(In that room,)

145
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:06,240
(there must've been someone else.)

146
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,000
Yuan,

147
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,919
rest assured.

148
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:37,320
I'll manage the theater well,

149
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,519
take care of everyone,

150
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:43,799
and take care of myself too.

151
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:18,399
Coming through. Make way.

152
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,600
Flowers! Fresh flowers!

153
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,480
Care for a bouquet?

154
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:39,320
Coming, sir.

155
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,799
I knew you faked it.

156
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,000
What's really going on?

157
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:00,080
Guan Xingkai,

158
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:02,639
stop pressuring me, will you?

159
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,759
Did Guan Qingyang tell you something?

160
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,360
It's about my parents, isn't it?

161
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,960
And what's with you and Xu Yanshu?

162
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,759
Stop asking.

163
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,039
You can't handle it.

164
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,440
So I was right.

165
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:21,879
Muling,

166
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,000
about my parents,

167
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,279
do you think I don't know?

168
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:27,720
And Xu Yanshu.

169
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:29,840
Did he force you?

170
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:36,879
Did he?

171
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,799
Xingkai.

172
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,519
Rickshaw coming through!

173
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:53,720
Make way!

174
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,000
You couldn't even keep track of her?

175
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:57,879
What good are you for?

176
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,679
I... I'm incompetent.

177
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,200
But

178
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,159
the young lady appeared suddenly,

179
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:03,000
which is why I...

180
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:04,840
Why was she there?

181
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:05,600
Well,

182
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,480
I don't know.

183
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:10,960
Leave.

184
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:12,039
Okay.

185
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:28,120
I know you did all that

186
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,000
for my sake.

187
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,080
But my parents were in love.

188
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,799
Though my mother was an actress,

189
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:36,320
my father wouldn't mind

190
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,039
or even hurt her

191
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:39,639
just to protect me.

192
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,279
And what's with you

193
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,840
and Xu Yanshu?

194
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,519
As Guan Qingyang

195
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:48,000
told me about that thing,

196
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,399
Xu Yanshu overheard us.

197
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,879
He blackmailed me

198
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:52,919
to let his sister have you.

199
00:13:58,679 --> 00:13:59,720
Liang Man is dead.

200
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:03,039
How could Guan Qingyang prove his story?

201
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,639
And he hated the Guan family

202
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,320
and my father.

203
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,600
Guan Qingyang said

204
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:12,000
that the killing

205
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,960
wasn't done by your father personally

206
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:15,799
but by his confidant, Kang Shao.

207
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:17,399
Kang Shao?

208
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,159
He indeed worked for my father.

209
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,960
But after I returned,

210
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:23,720
he left the Guan family.

211
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,559
I originally planned

212
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,000
to investigate this thoroughly.

213
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,159
But I couldn't

214
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:31,399
act right under your nose.

215
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:33,519
So I had no choice but to...

216
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:35,799
I was afraid that if you knew,

217
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,480
you might get hurt.

218
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,480
It's a shame

219
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:45,080
there wasn't enough time.

220
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:52,320
Muling,

221
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,039
all these

222
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,480
should've been my own burden.

223
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,480
Thank you.

224
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:02,240
Xingkai,

225
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,159
I'm sorry.

226
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:09,759
Muling,

227
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:12,720
if it weren't for me,

228
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,240
maybe Yuan

229
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:17,480
wouldn't have...

230
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:28,679
Come.

231
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,480
Where to?

232
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,759
To see how deep the Guans'

233
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,000
waters run.

234
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,360
(About those you've let go of,)

235
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,799
(I want to help you however I can.)

236
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:47,320
(No matter what you become)

237
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,240
(or how others see you,)

238
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,399
(in my heart,)

239
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,840
(you'll always be that girl
from back then.)

240
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,879
(I can't stay by your side anymore)

241
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,000
(or help you.)

242
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,039
(Don't let obsession consume you.)

243
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:06,960
(Take care of yourself.)

244
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,159
(Guan Qingyang.)

245
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:13,519
Master has passed away.

246
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:15,759
Xingkai

247
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,120
is going to marry that actress.

248
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,000
Second Master

249
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:25,080
has gone too.

250
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,639
Second Master,

251
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,759
you've really lost your mind.

252
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,279
Madam,

253
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:34,000
you must find peace.

254
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,000
Don't let grief ruin your health.

255
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,679
The weather

256
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,360
has turned cold.

257
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:50,559
The wind and sand

258
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,480
are blurring my vision.

259
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,080
Madam,

260
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:58,600
let's go inside.

261
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:00,679
