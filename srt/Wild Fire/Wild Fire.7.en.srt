00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,680
But today,

15
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,040
here at my father's altar,

16
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,480
I want him to see clearly

17
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:18,200
whether his beloved brother

18
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:20,159
still recognize him

19
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,799
and the true symbol of the Guan family.

20
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,400
Well,

21
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,240
let me take a look.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,840
It really is.

23
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,280
It truly is.

24
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,120
Get the seal ink.

25
00:01:57,062 --> 00:01:59,519
(Guan)

26
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,359
Look!

27
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,760
It's the real Guan family seal.

28
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:08,639
It's been so many years.

29
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,439
We all thought it was lost.

30
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:11,559
Didn't expect

31
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,000
it's in your hands.

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,840
That's right.

33
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,560
Wasn't it lost?

34
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,479
Where did you get it?

35
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,039
From the coffin?

36
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,759
If you had it all along,

37
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:29,000
why show it only now?

38
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:30,879
All these years,

39
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,080
what did you do for us?

40
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,800
And now you want to be the head

41
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,840
just by a fake seal?

42
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,360
Do you deserve it?

43
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,680
Uncle.

44
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,000
No need to worry about this.

45
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,080
The holder of the seal
is the family head.

46
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:50,360
That's the rule.

47
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,439
You know it

48
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,159
better than I do.

49
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:56,039
As for authenticity,

50
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,159
the elders have verified it.

51
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:00,879
You don't trust them?

52
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,120
I don't trust anyone.

53
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,800
I am from the Guan family,

54
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,759
and I know the rules.

55
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:09,919
But you'd better prove

56
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:11,240
this seal is real.

57
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,319
A family head must earn respect.

58
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,800
Uncle.

59
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:18,680
I'll send someone to collect

60
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,919
the ledgers and storeroom keys.

61
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,680
Please get them ready.

62
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,599
The ledgers over the years

63
00:03:40,359 --> 00:03:41,199
are all here.

64
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:42,039
Young Master.

65
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,560
The accounts of the Fourth

66
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,000
and Seventh Masters are absent.

67
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,159
They'll send them over

68
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,599
in a few days

69
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,439
after sorting.

70
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:50,560
Alright, you may leave.

71
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,439
Yes, Madam.

72
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,360
Xingkai.

73
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,680
Although you become the head

74
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,080
by the seal,

75
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,879
your foundation is weak.

76
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,960
It's natural they don't accept you.

77
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,000
If you truly want to change that,

78
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:08,560
your marriage with Qingqing

79
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,639
must be arranged soon.

80
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,240
Mother.

81
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,399
Marriage is important.

82
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,879
I don't want it to be a deal.

83
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:20,479
It's unfair

84
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,799
to both me

85
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,880
and Qingqing.

86
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:26,319
In families like ours,

87
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,720
fairness doesn't exist.

88
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:30,839
I can tell

89
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:31,720
Qingqing

90
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,360
truly likes you.

91
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,399
Besides, Guan family
and Xu family are old friends.

92
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,759
If you marry her,

93
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,079
you can get the Xu family's support.

94
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Otherwise...

95
00:04:45,466 --> 00:04:47,720
(To Madam Guan)

96
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,600
Look.

97
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:55,040
All the medicinal materials
we shipped to Jiangbei

98
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,319
have been detained at the dock
by Xu Yanshu.

99
00:04:57,446 --> 00:04:58,480
(Three days left till the deadline.
Please find a solution.)

100
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,320
Xingkai.

101
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:01,720
Those who accomplish great things

102
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,959
rarely have everything go their way.

103
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:08,480
I don't want to force you.

104
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,360
Think it over carefully.

105
00:05:31,239 --> 00:05:32,079
Ma'am,

106
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:32,919
excuse me a moment.

107
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,600
After being arrested so many times,

108
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:44,720
you can still stand here safely.

109
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,399
Truly impressive.

110
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:48,759
Unfortunately,

111
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,560
no matter how hard you try,

112
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,279
there's no place for you
in the Guan family.

113
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,319
Miss Xu, you must be joking.

114
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,080
Aren't we both

115
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:01,519
standing here now?

116
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:02,719
You...

117
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,639
A sharp-tongued actress.

118
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:14,439
But do you think Xingkai

119
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:15,879
will believe you?

120
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,440
Why are you here?

121
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,080
I heard

122
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,279
Master Guan passed.

123
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,880
I'm worried.

124
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:39,679
Let's go.

125
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:40,799
It's windy.

126
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:42,279
Let's talk inside.

127
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:44,239
Okay.

128
00:07:01,734 --> 00:07:04,560
(Rong City Police Department)

129
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,040
Open up.

130
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,439
Hurry.

131
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:06,279
Yes.

132
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:07,800
Please, Mr. Guan.

133
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,239
You mean,

134
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,240
Second Master sent him?

135
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:21,799
Yes.

136
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,800
Test him later.

137
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:25,519
If he can be used by us,

138
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,240
things

139
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,160
might get easier.

140
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,400
Okay.

141
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,520
How is it?

142
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,440
Miss Shen.

143
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:49,679
Are you satisfied?

144
00:07:50,119 --> 00:07:50,959
Take him away.

145
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:51,720
Yes.

146
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,560
Tell me.

147
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:54,560
Who sent you to harm me?

148
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,800
You wench.

149
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:00,839
No one sent me.

150
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,519
I just liked your looks.

151
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,040
Don't overthink it.

152
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:11,560
Don't think that by saying nothing,

153
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,600
you can leave here alive.

154
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,560
Cooperate,

155
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,639
and maybe I'll let you live.

156
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,640

196
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,160
Xingkai.

197
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,600
I was just discussing
our wedding with your mother.

198
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:04,919
Want to come?

199
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:10,239
Let's go.

200
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:14,720
Ma'am, which dress

201
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,560
looks better?

202
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,759
Whichever you like.

203
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,200
You are so beautiful.

204
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,320
Both will look good on you.

205
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,320
I think I prefer this one.

206
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,159
It suits me better.

207
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:24,999
Then go with it.

208
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,039
Match the hairstyle too.

209
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,759
Add a pearl hairpin.

210
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:32,919
Butterfly-shaped?

211
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:33,759
Yeah.

212
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:05,320
You got famous in Rong City

213
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:07,120
by this?

214
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:12,759
Likewise.

215
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:15,279
You just use this

216
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,080
to let Ruyi Theater decline.

217
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:25,399
I just want to remind you,

218
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,399
your act and your role must match.

219
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,360
Or you'll trip again

220
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:33,279
and ruin your name.

221
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:35,399
By the way,

222
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,879
the person you're waiting for today

223
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,280
won't be coming.

224
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:41,000
Not just today.

225
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,480
Never again.

226
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:45,359
What do you mean?

227
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:50,639
Don't you know that?

228
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,519
Mr. Guan and Miss Xu
will be engaged in three months.

229
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,360
Right now,

230
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,240
he is dining with my sister,

231
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,320
planning the wedding.

232
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,800
However, Miss Shen.

233
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,840
If you agree,

234
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,440
tomorrow

235
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,120
I can have your entire troupe

236
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,559
moved to my mansion,

237
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:14,360
performing only for me.

238
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:17,600
Performing solely
for the Tyrant of Jiangbei?

239
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,159
I do

240
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:22,039
have some self-respect.

241
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,080
My theater is small.

242
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,160
You should

243
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,280
go elsewhere.

244
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:34,840
What if I say I only want you?

245
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,960
I am not patient.

246
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,039
Now, you only have two choices.

247
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,200
Say yes,

248
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:45,960
or die.

249
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,240
My master once told me,

250
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,080
opera

251
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,240
is for the audience.

252
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,840
If can't,

253
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,519
I'd rather die.

254
00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:00,159
If you insist,

255
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:02,000
then, go ahead.

256
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:04,960
Come on.
