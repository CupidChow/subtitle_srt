Ruyi Theater's new play
takes the city by storm.

19
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:19,200
Based on a true story.

20
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,799
A fresh adaptation of The Encounter.

I got a ticket.

24

Impressive.

25
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:40,559
Let me see.

26
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:42,519
I never managed to get tickets.

27
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,760
Is it really that good?

28
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,840
Exactly!

29
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,079
It's amazing.

30
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,799
Absolutely breathtaking.

31
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:50,079
Master Liu and Miss Shen

33
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,120
What's even more remarkable is

34
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,120
the gimmick
of being based on a true story.

35
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,040
It makes people
can't help but speculate.

36
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,920
A true story?

37
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,200
Who?

38
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,239
You don't know?

39
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:01,359
Jin Ping, the Wangs' live-in son-in-law.

40
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:02,760
I heard recently

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,400
the Wangs took him
to Mr. Guan's private gathering.

42
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,560
They ran into his ex-fiancée,

43
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,639
who worked herself to the bone
funding his eight-year study abroad.

44
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,319
The theater folks were furious

45
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:12,639
and beat him and threw him out.

46
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:14,039
It serves him right.

47
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,080
A heartless scoundrel.

Senior,

50
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,639
I've delivered your message

51
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:24,520
for Commander Xu.

52
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,599
Senior,

53
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,960
today is Mr. Guan's private gathering.

54
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,639
Would it be improper to invite

55
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,240
Commander Xu abruptly?

56
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:40,199
You'll know soon.

57
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:43,559
Don't overthink it.

58
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,520
The audience is waiting.

59
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,439
I'll do your makeup today.

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,840
Make way.

61
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,599
Look away!

62
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:54,319
Move aside!

63
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,159
Move!

64
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:56,439
Honey.

(Ruyi Opera Troupe)
Let me go!

66
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,639
Today I'll smash this troupe!

67
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,120
Honey!

68
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,159
Calm down.

69
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:03,240
They turned my shame
into public entertainment.

70
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,840
Those ladies must be laughing

71
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,599
behind my back!

72
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:06,560
How can I stay calm!

73
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,439
If it weren't for you...

74
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,280
Forget it.

75
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,120
Let me go!

76
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,800
Honey.

77
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,640
Honey!

78
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,719
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

79
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:19,000
Who dares to applaud?

80
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,920
Honey.

81
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,520
Shen Muling!

82
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,840
What?

83
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,680
Brave enough to sing the opera,

84
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,479
but too cowardly to show yourself?

85
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,560
Mrs. Jin.

86
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,680
I was looking for you.

87
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:46,199
Someone here

88
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,520
has something to tell you.

89
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:50,639
What do you mean by that?

90
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,919
Perfect.

91
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:03,560
I knew

92
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,960
it was you again, little hussy!

93
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,680
I'll tear you apart today!

94
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,800
Calm down, Madam.

95
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,199
That day I did recognize Mr. Jin.

96
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,039
That's true.

97
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,919
I found him becoming

98
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:15,960
the Wang family's son-in-law
behind my back.

99
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,000
So I despised him

100
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,080
and hated him.

101
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,560
That's also true.

102
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:23,279
But I wasn't the one pestering him.

103
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,480
He was the one pestering me.

104
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,720
You...

105
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,560
You're slandering me!

106
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,040
Back in the village,

107
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,000
I repeatedly asked
to break off our engagement.

108
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:34,759
You were the one clinging to me.

109
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:36,240
Now things have come to this.

110
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,040
I've shown you mercy

111
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,160
time and time again.

112
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,959
Yet you still seek to defame me?

113
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:41,720
You even

114
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,319
went so far as to stage this show
to slander me.

115
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,279
What wickedness, Honey!

116
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:49,120
No wonder

117
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,519
you'll always remain
beneath decent society!

118
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:52,359
Mr. Jin,

119
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:53,479
may I ask

120
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:54,800
what this is?

121
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,399
What's this?

122
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,279
What is it?

123
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:08,679
Take a look.

124
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,640
Take a look.

125
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,000
Let me see.

126
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,759
What does it say?

127
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:14,599
Heavens!

128
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:17,199
Well...

129
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,519
What a heartless scoundrel!

130
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,680
The problem was never with the woman.

131
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,439
It's the man who's at fault.

132
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,560
(Yuan, could you spare some money?)
And he asked for money.

133
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:30,360
What an ungrateful wretch!

134
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,519
Gigolo!

135
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,040
He spent her money.

136
00:05:35,239 --> 00:05:36,079
Hon...

137
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:36,919
Honey.

138
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:38,679
Serves him right!

139
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,440
That's satisfying!

140
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,199
Ingrate!

141
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,039
Exactly!

142
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:43,360
Mrs. Jin,

143
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,399
after you married Mr. Jin,

144
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,720
he kept writing to me.

145
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,639
Always about one thing,

146
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:52,240
demanding school fees.

147
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:55,040
When I encountered him that day,

148
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,920
he mocked my theatrical career

149
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:00,399
and then made an offer

150
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,839
that if I'd comply,

151
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,560
he might kindly keep me
as his kept woman.

152
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,759
And then we could collaborate
from both sides

153
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:11,040
and swallow
the entire Wang family fortune.

154
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:12,479
I...

155
00:06:13,359 --> 00:06:14,199
Mrs. Jin.

156
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:15,120
He's utterly wicked!

157
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,279
I staged this drama today

158
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:17,839
not to make an enemy of you.

159
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,440
On the contrary,

160
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:21,680
I don't want to see you,

161
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,320
me,

162
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,800
or any other woman in Rong City

163
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,959
to be deceived by him again!

164
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,079
Don't let our love

165
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:31,160
become the weapon
he'll use to humiliate us later!

166
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:38,359
Mrs. Jin,

167
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,439
we did nothing wrong.

168
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,680
He's the one at fault!

169
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,040
Exactly.

170
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,840
Let me explain.

171
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:52,359
Everyone,

172
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,240
our family
has endured decades in business.

173
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,680
We value integrity the most.

174
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:59,160
I misjudged this man before.

175
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,959
But now I absolutely refuse

176
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:02,759
to let this treacherous schemer

177
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:03,839
and oath-breaker

178
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:04,920
tarnish our family's name.

179
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:06,359
Today,

180
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,959
with you as witnesses,

181
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm divorcing him.

182
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,840
From now on,

183
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:13,240
the Wang family and Jin Ping

184
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,120
are severed forever!

185
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,240
Honey!

186
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,080
Honey!

187
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,079
Why keep this scum?

188
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:25,920
He'll get his karma.

189
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:37,439
Honey!

190
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:38,279
Honey!

191
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,760
Honey!

192
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:41,039
Honey!

193
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,960
Honey!

194
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,560
Did that feel good?

195
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:49,799
Sure!

196
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,159
That's good.

197
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,520
Unbelievable.

198
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,720
Such a big surprise.

199
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,080
But

200
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,080
this time,

201
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,600
I truly must thank you, Mr. Guan.

202
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,399
If it weren't for you,

203
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:11,439
my foolish daughter

204
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:12,439
(Mrs. Jin's Father, Rong City merchant)
might

205
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:13,279
still have been

206
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:15,319
kept in the dark to this day.

207
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:17,799
Come on.

208
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,159
Let me

209
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:20,279
toast you.

210
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,960
I'm flattered.

211
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:30,079
To serve the medicine business' seniors

212
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:31,800
is my privilege.

213
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,960
What?

214
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,960
Still thinking about
establishing the commerce chamber?

215
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,680
Xingkai,

216
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,480
let me be frank with you.

217
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:49,159
Even without this mishap interrupting,

218
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,919
in my view,

219
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,200
it would still fail.

220
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,680
Of course,

221
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,840
it's not that we old-timers
cling to tradition,

222
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,639
but the chaotic wartime conditions

223
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,159
leave us barely coping.

224
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,119
You're right.

225
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,800
Yet I maintain

226
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,359
when in peril,

227
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
we must stick together.

228
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,399
Now my family's ships are seized.

229
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:16,240
But whose will be next?

230
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,440
But if we all contribute,

231
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,600
we'll eventually disperse the cold mist.

232
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,799
You veterans have weathered

233
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:23,639
countless storms.

234
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:24,999
Your experience

235
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,039
far surpasses mine.

236
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,960
I believe

237
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,120
your understanding of this

238
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,440
runs deeper than mine.

239
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:33,399
Forming the chamber

240
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:34,719
is urgent business.

241
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:38,399
Well said.

242
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:39,639
Well said.

243
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,519
Truly impressive.

244
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,279
Truly impressive.

245
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:47,599
How about

246
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:49,519
this?

247
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,960
We elders

248
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:52,240
will entrust this matter

249
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:55,759
entirely to your hands.

250
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:57,599
What say you?

251
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:00,639
Thank you, seniors.

252
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,080
I will live up

253
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:03,279
to your expectations.

254
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:04,239
Very good.

255
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,240
Good.

256
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,080
- Come on.
- Come on.

257
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:14,639
Mr. Guan,

258
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:16,599
rumor says

259
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:19,960
you plan to marry Miss Shen.

260
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,440
When is the wedding date set for?

261
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,280
It's not decided yet.

262
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,759
About this matter,

263
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,200
I have no final say.

264
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,960
It depends on her.

265
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,320
Okay.

266
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,800
Don't be afraid.

267
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:50,000
Tell me if you're ready.

268
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,040
I can wait.

269
00:11:00,878 --> 00:11:04,679
(Ruyi Opera Troupe)

270
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:06,039
On forming the commerce chamber,

271
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:07,200
what are your thoughts?

272
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,240
Mr. Guan, it's said
you proposed to Miss Shen.

273
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,399
Is this true?

274
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:11,639
Exactly.

275
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:12,399
Everyone, please!

276
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:13,960
Don't push forward.

277
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,800
Is this true?

278
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,800
Mr. Guan,

279
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,440
I can answer the question

280
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:23,759
you asked me right now.

281
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,559
Since you're so interested
in my personal affairs,

282
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,800
today

283
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,440
I'll clarify here.

284
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,720
I have no romantic involvement

285
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,120
with Guan Xingkai at all.

286
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,320
My heart belongs

287
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:51,519
to someone else.

288
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,680
Someone else?

289
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,919
Who could it be?

290
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:55,440
It's not Mr. Guan?

291
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:56,960
What?

292
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,960
Well...

293
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,960
Commander Xu.

294
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:13,119
You're here.

295
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,440
Duty delayed me.

296
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:15,639
Am I late?

297
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:16,759
No.

298
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,560
What are you doing?

299
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,239
Are you okay?

300
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,360
They're fighting.

301
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,360
Are you in trouble?

302
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,440
Shen Muling,

303
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:32,759
it's a lie, right?

304
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:36,399
Mr. Guan,

305
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,279
everything between us
has just been an act.

306
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:40,960
Since it's an act,

307
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,559
none of it was real.

308
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:44,639
Just blame yourself

309
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,720
for getting too invested.

310
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:52,639
Let's go.

311
00:12:57,639 --> 00:12:59,200
