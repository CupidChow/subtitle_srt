Xingkai.

Guan Xingkai.

16
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:27,359
Wake up.

17
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:28,439
Xingkai.

18
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,680
Xingkai!

19
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:41,879
It was too dangerous!

20
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:42,959
I almost thought...

21
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:48,120
Shen Muling, you don't cherish your life

22
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:49,959
doesn't mean others don't.

23
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,240
On the gathering,

24
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,760
where were you?

25
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,320
(For safety,)

26
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,920
(everything that happened today)

27
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,840
(must stay secret.)

28
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:01,199
Liar.

29
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,920
I shouldn't trust you.

30
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,760
You liar.

31
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:07,359
Listen to me.

32
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,319
There's an emergency at the front line.

33
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,000
The chaos at the theater last night
was also set up.

34
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,842
(Mr. Jin Ping and Mrs. Jin
from Guan Xingkai)

35
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:25,759
What is this?

36
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:27,719
A fake invitation.

37
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,360
Someone lured Jin Ping

38
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:32,520
to stir up trouble at the gathering.

39
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:35,999
It was Bai Cheng.

40
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,280
So this time,

41
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:57,400
you used yourself as bait

42
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,719
and played along with the scheme?

43
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,080
Uncle's in charge for years.

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,840
He is meticulous.

45
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,560
If I don't take the risk,

46
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,080
he wouldn't slip.

47
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:11,919
From my mother, to Liang Man,

48
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:14,960
to Bai Xiaodi...

49
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:17,759
- Chunsheng.
- Sir.

50
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,680
- Take him back.
- Got it.

51
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,056
Come on.

52
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,520
Come on.

53
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,280
Think it through.

54
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,439
Don't help people who are using you.

55
00:03:29,824 --> 00:03:30,664
Let's go.

56
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,520
To Guan family, these people

57
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,400
are already dead.

58
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,400
Only when their interests are threatened

59
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,159
will we have a real chance.

60
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:48,400
Muling, I know you want
to avenge Master yourself.

61
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:49,879
But this is too risky.

62
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,680
Next time,

63
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,639
can you let me know?

64
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:54,159
I'll help you.

65
00:03:55,098 --> 00:03:55,528
Alright?

66
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:00,039
But here,

67
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,719
only I can help you.

68
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,159
Your reputation...

69
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:15,319
No. No way.

70
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,399
A woman's virtue doesn't lie

71
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,360
in her skirt,

72
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,800
nor in others' mouths.

73
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:24,639
I know what I'm doing.

74
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,840
Ma'am.

75
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,399
Does Xingkai forget

76
00:04:58,399 --> 00:04:59,240
my birthday?

77
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,000
Why hasn't he come?

78
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,000
Zhang.

79
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,480
Qingqing, today is your birthday.

80
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,079
I give you this bracelet

81
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,120
as a gift on Xingkai's behalf.

82
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,800
When he's free,

83
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,680
he'll prepare a proper gift

84
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,040
and give it to you in person.

85
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,399
No. Ma'am. This is too precious.

86
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:23,160
I can't accept it.

87
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,439
We're family.

88
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:25,040
Put it on.

89
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,000
I really can't, Ma'am.

90
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,840
Qingqing.

91
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,160
Take it.

92
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,000
Brother?

93
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,920
Ma'am means well.

94
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,760
Just take it.

95
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:33,599
Why are you here?

96
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:34,160
You said

97
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,319
you had crucial things today.

98
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:36,240
Nothing matters more

99
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,600
than your birthday.

100
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:39,319
That's true.

101
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:40,159
Here.

102
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:41,759
What's it?

103
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,599
Open it.

104
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:46,359
Like it?

105
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,360
Let me help you.

106
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:52,919
Zhang.

107
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,200
Qingqing.

108
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,159
Well,

109
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,560
I'm clumsy,

110
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,400
not good at this.

111
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,960
Take it back.

112
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,000
Wear it yourself.

113
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:09,279
Okay.

114
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,320
Ma'am, I'll leave.

115
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,000
Commander, please.

116
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,960
I didn't expect

117
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,240
you to come in person.

118
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,279
I've received

119
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,240
your message.

120
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:22,360
Just rest assured.

121
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,440
In the Guan family,

122
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:27,000
marriage's decided by the parents.

123
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,879
This marriage

124
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:31,279
is settled.

125
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,120
It was the Old Master's wish.

126
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,360
Then I can rest easy.

127
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,159
Madam!

128
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:41,839
Madam.

129
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:42,879
Don't panic.

130
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:43,719
So improper!

131
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,520
Really?

132
00:06:56,919 --> 00:06:57,759
Leave.

133
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:58,599
Yes.

134
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:07,279
Madam.

135
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,920
Nonsense!

136
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,040
How could Xingkai elope with an actress?

137
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,560
Tell me.

138
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:28,599
When was this?

139
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,039
Madam.

140
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,000
This morning,

141
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,319
Young Master went to the theater late,

142
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,640
and Miss Shen...

143
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,560
The head of the troupe argued with him,

144
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:38,759
saying,

145
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,199
"You are getting married,

146
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:41,199
why come here?"

147
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,760
Hearing this,

148
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,000
Young Master's anxious.

149
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,320
He said he never

150
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,639
wanted the marriage.

151
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,840
That if she wanted,

152
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:49,039
they could

153
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,800
elope right away.

154
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,240
I thought

155
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,199
he was joking.

156
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,800
But then

157
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,079
I found this letter

158
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:59,160
in the side room.

159
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:01,799
Madam.

160
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:03,759
Did they really elope?

161
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:04,599
Nonsense.

162
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,800
Xingkai is the only son of Guan family.

163
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:11,000
He was born with responsibilities.

164
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,319
How dare he do this for an actress?

165
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:14,199
How dare he!

166
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:17,480
Just like his father.

167
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,800
Both useless.

168
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,399
Madam, don't be angry.

169
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:23,239
Young Master

170
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,079
might have his own plan.

171
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,960
And...

172
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,759
And you!

173
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,039
Can't do your job well.

174
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,639
You didn't even stop him!

175
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:36,479
Someone!

176
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,840
Drag him out and beat him!

177
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,080
Madam!

178
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,759
Madam.

179
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:40,840
I was wrong!

180
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,240
Madam.

181
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:41,720
Go.

182
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,560
Madam.

183
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,360
Stop it!

184
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,200
Second Master.

185
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:55,840
Second Master.

186
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,480
Please save me.

187
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,320
I didn't mean to.

188
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,200
I really didn't.

189
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,080
If you don't tell the truth,

190
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,679
no one can save you. Talk!

191
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:03,519
What happened?

192
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:16,440
So,

193
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:19,399
when they were eloping,

194
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,759
you caught them

195
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:23,679
and pushed them,

196
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:25,719
right?

197
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:27,639
Since last time's failure,

198
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:30,000
I couldn't let it go.

199
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:32,679
A fake invitation

200
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,919
could throw the gathering into chaos,

201
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,919
but Shen Muling is still alive.

202
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,639
As long as she's alive,

203
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:41,080
I cannot be at ease.

204
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,799
So I kept following her.

205
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,320
Unexpectedly,

206
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,480
I saw them trying to elope.

207
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,440
Second Master.

208
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,639
Second Master.

209
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,279
You told me not to hurt Young Master.

210
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,840
Now,

211
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,159
you must save me.

212
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:55,840
Second Master.

213
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,799
You have to save me now!

214
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:01,559
It's okay.

215
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,080
Come on.

216
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,920
Get up.

217
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,160
Get up.

218
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,200
Didn't you ask me

219
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,840
when to take charge of Guan family?

220
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:14,559
Now is the best time.

221
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:18,600
Listen.

222
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,600
Tonight,

223
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,679
move out the last batch of goods

224
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:23,000
from the warehouse.

225
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,840
And then,

226
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,159
spread the news

227
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:27,480
of their elopement.

228
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,599
Got it.

229
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,519
(Dear nephew.)

230
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:37,120
(Don't blame me.)

231
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:40,720
(Blame your own fate.)

232
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,840
It's been a long time

233
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,440
since I had a peaceful moment like this.

234
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:00,519
I still remember when we were little,

235
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,240
after performance,

236
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:05,600
Master would take us up to the rooftop

237
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:09,399
to watch the stars.

238
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,160
Guan Xingkai.

239
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,240
Guan Xingkai.

240
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,039
Where are you?

241
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,320
Where did you go?

242
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,160
