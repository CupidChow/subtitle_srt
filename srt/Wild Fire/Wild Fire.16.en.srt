00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,600
Muling?

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,240
Muling?

16
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,520
Are you alright?

17
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,400
Why are you here?

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Who else do you expect?

19
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:35,199
Let go of me!

20
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,040
Miss Shen,

21
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,799
how quickly you dote on the new,

22
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:40,920
forgetting me completely.

23
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:45,079
Guan Xingkai,

24
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,760
we're at Yanshu's

25
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,840
banquet in his mansion.

26
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:51,560
Are you abducting me?

27
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:53,079
Yanshu?

28
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,920
So what if I am?

29
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,719
The whole city knows

30
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:59,000
you were my woman.

31
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,239
You turned to Xu Yanshu overnight.

32
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,279
Miss Shen,

33
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,079
don't mistake me
for some chivalrous gentleman

34
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:09,520
who'd hesitate to act.

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,879
Let go!

36
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,080
Let go!

37
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:16,759
Guan Xingkai,

38
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,560
I never thought you'd sink this low.

39
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,039
How many times must I say it?

40
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:22,439
There's nothing between us.

41
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:23,800
Why keep pushing me like this?

42
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,159
Muling.

43
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,360
This is my final warning.

44
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,719
Stop harassing me.

45
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,960
Am I clear?

46
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,920
Young Master,

47
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,439
should we take Miss Shen away?

48
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,520
Drive.

49
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,439
Okay.

50
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,520
You're so brainless.

51
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,120
She was at the door.

52
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,240
Couldn't you drag her in?

53
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:13,800
There are other people outside,

54
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,080
Miss Xu.

55
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:19,159
I worked hard to create this chance.

56
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:20,719
If you disgraced Shen Muling tonight,

57
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:21,759
she'd have been ruined.

58
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,599
Then neither here nor the Guan family

59
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,439
will tolerate her.

60
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,000
And this is how you did it?

61
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:37,120
Miss Xu,

62
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,360
I came to help,

63
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,319
not to be your servant.

64
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,120
Fine.

65
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:54,120
I'll go bring her over now.

66
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:55,319
I hope

67
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:56,560
you won't mess up again.

68
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:19,639
He...

69
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:20,160
Help!

70
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,000
Don't move.

71
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:23,920
Help!

72
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,560
What...

73
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,400
What do we do now?

74
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,000
Knock her out?

75
00:04:33,119 --> 00:04:33,959
It's you.

76
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:34,360
You wench!

77
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,839
Xu Qingqing, you want to hurt Muling?

78
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:36,679
I won't let...

79
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,640
Yuan?

80
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:53,039
Yuan?

81
00:04:58,439 --> 00:04:59,279
What should we do?

82
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,359
Yuan?

83
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,560
Is that you?

84
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,840
Kill her.

85
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,360
What?

86
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,200
Kill her.

87
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,519
She's Shen Muling's friend.

88
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,920
If this gets exposed,

89
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,800
we'll be in trouble.

90
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,080
Help!

91
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:28,599
Yuan?

92
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,799
Is that you?

93
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:32,279
Senior!

94
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:33,119
Shut up.

95
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,039
Senior!

96
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:39,159
Yuan,

97
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,320
is that you?

98
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,400
Yuan!

99
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,159
Yuan!

100
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,160
Yuan, wake up!

101
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:49,879
Can you hear me?

102
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,760
What happened?

103
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:53,599
Yuan!

104
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,040
Yuan, wake up!

105
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,880
Yuan!

106
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,479
Yuan!

107
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,240
Miss Shen,

108
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,080
what happened?

109
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:58,799
Someone!

110
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:04,319
Stop the car.

111
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:07,679
What's wrong?

112
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,000
Turn the car around.

113
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:10,319
Muling wasn't well.

114
00:08:10,999 --> 00:08:11,839
She seemed drugged.

115
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:12,519
What?

116
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:13,120
Quickly.

117
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,960
Okay.

118
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,160
I heard noises when I came upstairs.

119
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,279
It was Muling screaming.

120
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:33,000
When I ran here from my room,

121
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,440
I saw someone

122
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,000
escaping through the window.

123
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,440
Then I found Muling on the floor,

124
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,279
with a body next to her.

125
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:47,559
Yanshu,

126
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:48,399
what should we do?

127
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:49,719
I'm so scared.

128
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:51,519
Muling will be okay, right?

129
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,519
The killer broke into our mansion
at this hour,

130
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:58,840
committed murder, and escaped...

131
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:00,639
If word gets out,

132
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,039
I will become a laughingstock.

133
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:07,584
Return first.
I'll take Muling to the hospital.

134
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:08,759
You two,

135
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,840
take the body away.

136
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,200
Yes.

137
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:29,879
Muling!

138
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:45,119
What happened?

139
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,840
Keep quiet.

140
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,840
If word gets out,

141
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,759
you'll be punished.

142
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:49,599
Understood.

143
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,360
Xu Yanshu,

144
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,879
what exactly happened?

145
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:54,320
The Commander's Mansion's affairs

146
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,160
don't concern you.

147
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,440
Ridiculous!

148
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,039
A murder occurred here.

149
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,240
Do you even care about her at all?

150
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,080
Can you protect her or not?

151
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,879
It's between Muling and me.

152
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:06,159
None of your business.

153
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,119
I'm taking her away.

154
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,320
Don't you dare.

155
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,480
Why wouldn't I dare?

156
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,840
Put her down!

157
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:20,120
If you want the Guan family after you,

158
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:21,519
shoot me right now.

159
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:23,240
You've kept

160
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:24,759
humiliating Qingqing!

161
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,919
Let whoever wants your sister take her.

162
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:29,200
I'll marry

163
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:30,519
only Shen Muling.

164
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:33,639
Guan Xingkai!

165
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:38,519
Muling?

166
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,920
Muling,

167
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:42,399
are you okay?

168
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,680
Yanshu.

169
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:55,359
Yanshu.

170
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,320
I'm here.

171
00:10:57,088 --> 00:10:58,144
Let's go to the hospital.

172
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:00,960
Come on.
