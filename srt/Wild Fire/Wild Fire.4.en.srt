14
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,040
Are you crazy?

15
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,200
Let's go.

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Why are you so alarmed?

17
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,079
It's just a stray cat.

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,760
Second Master.

19
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:05,000
It's risky to be here
in the middle of the night.

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,159
It's them.

21
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,439
They killed my master.

22
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,439
I just saw that bead.

23
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:10,680
What bead?

24
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,639
When I went in that night,

25
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,520
Master already stopped breathing.

26
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:16,960
That fire

27
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,560
was to cover up the truth.

28
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,199
The bead in Guan Qingyang's hand

29
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,800
is the same as the one
before my master's bed.

30
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:27,360
That bead was a gift
from him to Liang Man.

31
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:31,439
Now that we know it's them,
let's have them expose themselves.

32
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,280
Go.

33
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,520
What is it?

34
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:13,520
(Why is there blood?)

35
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,960
(What's going on?)

36
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,919
(Lanyu!)

37
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,520
Ghost!

38
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:30,960
There's a ghost, Madam.

39
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,319
I saw blood on the scripture.

40
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,120
What blood?

41
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:43,319
See for yourself.

42
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:45,240
There are no bloody words like you said.

43
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,280
But my master's name was...

44
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:55,599
Madam,

45
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:57,759
I swear I'm not lying to you.

46
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:58,879
It was really here.

47
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,360
It's you.

48
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:05,599
You did it.

49
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:08,879
Madam,

50
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:10,960
what is she talking about?

51
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,919
Ghost and scripture?

52
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,879
I don't know any of it.

53
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,560
You're the murderer.

54
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:18,639
What are you trying to do?

55
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,199
Throwing dirt on me?

56
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,519
Mother,

57
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:28,199
if she insists there is a ghost,

58
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:30,079
why not have a sorcerer here?

59
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:31,680
If it's true,

60
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,319
we could have him put our mind at ease.

61
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:38,240
Xingkai has a point.

62
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,976
(Xu Qingqing, Commander's sister)
Ma'am.

63
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,000
But,

64
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,920
there are so many people in this house,

65
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:51,399
why is Liang so adamant about Miss Shen?

66
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:53,600
Everyone knows

67
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,519
that Miss Shen is...

68
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,839
I mean,

69
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,519
this evil spirit could
be attached to anyone.

70
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:05,480
If it really happened,

71
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,079
both of them should be suspects.

72
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,839
Miss Xu, your timing is impeccable.

73
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:15,759
I think Qingqing has a point.

74
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,480
Miss Shen,

75
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,399
what do you think?

76
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,879
Madam,

77
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:24,839
if we can uncover the truth

78
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:26,079
to restore peace to this family

79
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:27,399
and also prove my innocence,

80
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,399
I would love to.

81
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:30,920
Alright then.

82
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,680
Let's do as you say.

83
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:33,720
Xingkai.

84
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,600
You take care

85
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,720
of this matter.

86
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:38,680
Okay.

87
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:44,519
Miss Shen.

88
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:50,759
Miss Shen.

89
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,399
I saw Liang Man acting crazy

90
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:56,199
and wanted to help clear your name.

91
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:57,879
If I said anything wrong,

92
00:05:57,879 --> 00:05:58,800
please don't blame me,

93
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,360
okay?

94
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:01,079
I won't.

95
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,040
Wonderful.

96
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,639
I knew you were kind-hearted.

97
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:06,639
Oh,

98
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:08,800
I heard from Xingkai

99
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,319
and you sing opera beautifully.

100
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,199
If you have time,

101
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:13,800
will you be willing to

102
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,600
perform at the Commander's Mansion?

103
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,720
Miss Xu. We have other matters.
We'll be leaving.

104
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,480
This is Master Liu.

105
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:55,399
He knows astronomy and geography,

106
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:57,839
and can communicate with spirits.

107
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,959
Just drink this bowl
of golden talisman spirit-calling water.

108
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:06,800
After three breaths,

109
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,959
the evil spirit will
appear in the mirror.

110
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,360
Then I'll dispel it with a ritual.

111
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,319
Drink it.

112
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:34,319
Why is it so eerie here?

113
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,319
Dispelling evil spirits

114
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,839
is just like this.

115
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,040
If I could see Master,

116
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:41,519
I would love to drink it.

117
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:43,360
Wait.

118
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,879
Your sins are heavy.

119
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:46,480
You need one more talisman.

120
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,360
Feeling guilty, Concubine Liang?

121
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:14,399
Not good.

122
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:16,200
The spirits have grievances.

123
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:23,000
Master Liu.

124
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,039
W-What to do?

125
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,200
Master Liu.

126
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,799
Where is everyone?

127
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:37,799
Where did they go?

128
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:40,480
Master Liu!

129
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,679
Man.

130
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:46,720
Man.

131
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,840
Man.

132
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,639
Man.

133
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,240
Man.

134
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:12,960
M-M-Master.

135
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,320
Man.

136
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,639
Why did you kill me?

137
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:18,879
Master.

138
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,399
I'm sorry.

139
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,320
I didn't mean to.

140
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:23,759
I didn't want to kill you.

141
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:24,679
It's...

142
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:00,960
Young Master.

143
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,200
Time to go to the dock.

144
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,472
Young Master?

145
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,920
Young Master.

146
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,320
You're annoying.

147
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,360
Why now?

148
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,399
You are quite convincing.

149
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:24,879
Let's go.

150
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,039
Young Master. This way.

151
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:42,600
Watch it.

152
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:45,440
This.

153
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:49,519
Come.

154
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,720
(He's not very patient.)

155
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,360
Take him to the police station
and make him talk.

156
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,240
Let's see

157
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,279
who's so eager to kill me.

158
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,159
This is fishy.

159
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:39,840
All with opium.

160
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:55,720
Young Master, we are a family of
physicians for generations.

161
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,120
How could someone do
such a deranged thing?

162
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,720
If this spreads out,

163
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,639
our reputation will be ruined.

164
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:08,039
Perhaps it's already out.

165
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:12,799
Tell Zhang Ye to hold all the medicine
intended for the front line.

166
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:14,039
Check thoroughly.

167
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:15,080
Hurry up.

168
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,559
The "ghost" in this family

169
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:25,200
will be revealed soon.

170
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,000
Xingkai.

171
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:38,399
Xingkai.

172
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:41,039
If you like opera,

173
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:43,240
you can invite Miss Shen
to your house to perform

174
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,000
and send her back when you get bored.

175
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,320
I know

176
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,159
men tend to have multiple wives.

177
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:51,440
Don't go too far though.

178
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:58,840
But if you genuinely like her,

179
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,480
it's not that I can't accept it.

180
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,039
We aren't married yet.

181
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:07,159
Why would I

182
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:10,039
need your permission?

183
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:12,879
Miss Xu,

184
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,879
are you willing

185
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:16,799
to share your beloved one

186
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:19,000
with others?

187
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,159
Our mothers are like this too.

188
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:24,080
Why not?

189
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,360
What I want

190
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,039
is a lifetime

191
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,600
with one person.

192
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:49,919
(Master,)

193
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,200
(Liang Man has confessed.)

194
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,240
(I will find the person behind this.)

195
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,279
(I won't let anyone who killed you off.)

♪I have a little sister called Jiumei♪

197

199
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:31,720
♪She excels at playing music, chess,
calligraphy, and painting♪

200
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,600
(Muling.)

201
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,879
(Muling.)

202
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,320
Master.

203
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,679
This is the first play you taught me.

204
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:00,960
Do you still remember?

205
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,400
Muling.

206
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,119
Did you see it?

207
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,240
Master is right there.

208
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:27,400
She is smiling at me.

209
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:30,880
Muling.

210
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:34,720
Mother is already gone.

211
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:38,599
As soon as Master died,

212
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,759
Liang Man entered the Guan family.

213
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,839
Master's death can't be that simple.

214
00:17:46,112 --> 00:17:48,608
She and my uncle must've been
having an affair for a long time.

215
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:50,440
The person behind this

216
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,799
should be Guan Qingyang.

217
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,160
Why would he want to kill Master?

218
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:58,680
There was no enmity between them.

219
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,839
It must be related to
the years of internal struggle

220
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:02,960
within the Guan family.

221
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,480
Only by knowing what happened back then,
can we know the cause of her death.

222
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,319
Not a single one of them
should be spared.

223
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:12,160
Promise me.

224
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:14,160
No matter who it is,

225
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:16,480
I will not let them off.

226
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:19,880
I miss Master so much.

227
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:28,279
No one will love me anymore.

228
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:30,599
I will always be by your side.

229
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,039
Young Master!

230
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,960
