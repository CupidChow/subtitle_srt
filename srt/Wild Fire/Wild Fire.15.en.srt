00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:14,159
Senior.

15
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:14,560
Yes?

16
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,519
I just got the news.

17
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,239
Guan Qingyang committed suicide.

18
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:18,359
What?

19
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:20,640
(I thought what he said was)

20
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,840
(all to exonerate himself.)

21
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:23,599
(Why would he do that?)

22
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:26,799
(Kang Shao is a key figure
in this matter.)

23
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,040
Yuan,

24
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,120
have people

25
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,120
watch over Kang Shao.

26
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,480
Make sure.

27
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:32,559
Okay.

28
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:33,120
Hurry up.

29
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:33,960
Okay.

30
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,519
(Before it's completely confirmed,)

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,640
(I can't let Xingkai know about it.)

32
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,240
(If it's true,)

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
(I'll keep this secret hidden forever.)

34
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:50,159
Yanshu,

35
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:52,719
you know very well
I don't like that actress.

36
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,120
Why did you bring her home?

37
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,640
From now on,

38
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,719
don't call her 'actress.'

39
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,879
She is my future wife.

40
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,599
Will you really marry her?

41
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,360
Did you consider my feelings?

42
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:17,039
Soon, you'll

43
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,719
fulfill your wish
and marry Guan Xingkai.

44
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:24,919
Shen Muling poses no threat to you.

45
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:27,719
Fulfill my wish?

46
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,039
Yanshu,

47
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:32,599
all these years,

48
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:33,759
you never understood me.

49
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,759
Rong City has many ambitious young men.

50
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:38,800
I don't have to cling to Guan Xingkai.

51
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:41,639
I'm doing it for you.

52
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:50,800
We grew up together.

53
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:53,719
Years

54
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,520
on the frontline.

55
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,479
Scars on your body,

56
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,199
graves for your men.

57
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,840
Do you think I don't know?

58
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:08,520
Every time you return,

59
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,120
you lock yourself in the study.

60
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:11,960
I know you're not happy.

61
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:14,960
So I want to help you.

62
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,680
The Guans are a century old.

63
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,599
If I can marry Guan Xingkai,

64
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,599
their power can be used for our family.

65
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,640
Don't you understand?

66
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,840
Forget it.

67
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,439
You've never thought
of understanding me.

68
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,520
(Xin Sheng Chang Marine Goods)
Excuse me.

69
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:25,439
Ying said you want to see me.

70
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:27,279
Who are you?

71
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:31,839
Miss Xu, you need not care who I am.

72
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:36,120
You only need to know one thing.

73
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:40,560
I can rid you of your greatest threat.

74
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,760
Ridiculous.

75
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:46,319
I don't have the 'greatest threat.'

76
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,800
Shen Muling.

77
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:07,519
How could you possibly know her?

78
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,639
I naturally cannot.

79
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:14,480
But this woman

80
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,000
is fickle and unfaithful.

81
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,399
She flirted
with another young master before.

82
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,120
After gaining many benefits,

83
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,040
she turned and hitched up with Mr. Guan.

84
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:26,680
Our young master couldn't stand it

85
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,680
and swore

86
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,560
he wouldn't let her off easily.

87
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,600
An actress is ultimately lowly,

88
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,439
unwilling to change her ways.

89
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,120
However,

90
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:44,040
why should I believe you?

91
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,240
I heard the Commander's welcome banquet
is in a few days.

92
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,960
By then,

93
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:01,199
as long as you

94
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,439
put this drug

95
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,399
into Shen Muling's drink,

96
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I will

97
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:09,920
naturally provide you

98
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,639
with a satisfactory result.

99
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:24,679
Sedative?

100
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,399
(Shen Muling,)

101
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:47,399
(prepare to die.)

102
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,639
Miss Xu, we hope
you will help more in the future.

103
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,080
Sure thing.

104
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,279
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you

105
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,439
for attending my welcoming banquet.

106
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,279
Now the situation is turbulent.

107
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,959
We all need to be united

108
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,319
and work together.

109
00:07:13,999 --> 00:07:14,839
Each of you present

110
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:16,639
is a pillar of your respective fields.

111
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,560
Let's all join forces to navigate

112
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:21,319
these difficult times.

113
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,480
Well said.

114
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,560
We have prepared some wine.

115
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:27,959
Enjoy yourselves.

116
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:31,424
- To Commander.
- To Commander.

117
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,720
Commander Xu, you've always
kept away from women.

118
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,120
Now you suddenly
have a beauty by your side.

119
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,959
I assume something good
is about to happen.

120
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:43,919
Thank you.

121
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,000
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

122
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,720
Congratulations.

123
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,360
I'm late.

124
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,200
Congratulations.

125
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,480
Any good news about Commander Xu

126
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,519
and Miss Shen?

127
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,240
Mr. Guan,

128
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,240
don't tease me.

129
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,720
If we are talking about good news,

130
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,959
it should be about you

131
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:04,519
and my sister, Qingqing.

132
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,039
Qingqing,

133
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,800
your fiancé is here.

134
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,040
Haven't you been expecting him?

135
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,199
Stop making fun of me.

136
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:15,919
Xingkai,

137
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,959
don't listen to his nonsense.

138
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,480
Actually, I am quite familiar
with Miss Shen.

139
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:23,399
If we truly become a family,

140
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,920
wouldn't that be even more perfect?

141
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,879
Mr. Guan, stop joking.

142
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,799
I'm acquainted with you,

143
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,240
but not very familiar.

144
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:38,719
Muling,

145
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,080
it was me being immature before.

146
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,559
I thought you liked Xingkai,

147
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,440
which is why I offended you.

148
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:49,039
Now that you've entered
the Commander's Mansion,

149
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:50,840
and my brother loves you,

150
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,639
we are also a family.

151
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,240
So we should get along well,
shouldn't we?

152
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:03,599
Muling,

153
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,639
if you're willing to forgive me

154
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:06,679
without holding grudges,

155
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,120
drink this toast.

156
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,320
We can let bygones be bygones

157
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,159
and forget our grievances.

158
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:12,999
How about it?

159
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:19,719
Okay.

160
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,960
It's rare

161
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:27,159
to see you two getting along well.

162
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,840
How about the four of us
have a drink together?

163
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,999
Sure.

164
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,320
Zhang.

165
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,160
Since...

166
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,840
Since we can't agree on it...

167
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:00,799
(Kang Shao worked for Guan Hanyang.)

168
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,320
(It's normal for him to contact Zhang.)

169
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:06,600
(But why are they
pulling each other here?)

170
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:09,359
Alright.

171
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:13,159
Shen Muling is really valuable.

172
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:14,679
Everyone wants her dead.

173
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:16,080
Alright.

174
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,039
Then let her prepare more money.

175
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:31,639
No.

176
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:32,719
Senior.

177
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,040
Muling,

178
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:36,759
for the opening dance,

179
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,399
care to dance with me?

180
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,320
Of course.

181
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:23,759
Xingkai,

182
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,840
aren't you going to invite me?

183
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,800
Okay.

184
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,840
Don't get distracted.

185
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:12,479
Are you okay?

186
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,480
It seems the Commander's Mansion
will soon have two weddings.

187
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,279
You don't know, huh?

188
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,600
The one who was recently paired
with Mr. Guan is none other

189
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,120
than Miss Shen next to the Commander.

190
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:35,879
Miss Shen is really something.

191
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,039
Both Mr. Guan and Commander Xu
fell for her.

192
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,039
People aim for higher.

193
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,720
If these two couples work out,

194
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,759
it'll be fun to watch.

195
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,160
Are you okay?

196
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:53,039
Miss Shen,

197
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:53,879
are you okay?

198
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:55,639
I'm fine.

199
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:57,200
It must be the wine.

200
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,840
I'm a bit dizzy.

201
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,320
Let me take you back.

202
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,160
No need.

203
00:13:02,319 --> 00:13:03,159
On such an occasion,

204
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:04,080
you should stay.

205
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:06,399
Liusu.

206
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,679
Take her to her room

207
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:09,440
for a good rest.

208
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:09,960
Yes.

209
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,800
Ying,

210
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,720
help them out.

211
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,560
Yes.

212
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:18,879
Xingkai,

213
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,279
I've prepared some cold dishes
over there.

214
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,119
Let's go take a look.

215
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:26,960
Let's go.

216
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,120
I've long admired your reputation.

217
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,000
Miss Shen,

218
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,840
are you alright?

219
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:55,999
I'm fine.

220
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,639
I'm feeling a bit hot.

221
00:13:58,159 --> 00:13:59,080
I can't breathe.

222
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:00,960
Liusu,

223
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,440
Miss Shen seems to be drunk.

224
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:04,759
Go to the kitchen
and make some hangover soup.

225
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:06,080
I'll take her back to her room.

226
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,080
Miss Shen,

227
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,799
you'll feel better
after drinking the soup.

228
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:14,679
I'll be right back.

229
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,280
Thank you.

230
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,639
Ying, wait a moment.

231
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,119
What's wrong?

232
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:24,279
Miss Xu wants you over.

233
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,200
Impossible.

234
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,120
I have to take Miss Shen
back to her room.

235
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,200
Can't Miss Shen go by herself?

236
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:32,479
Then I'm leaving.

237
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,799
I've told you.

238
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:35,279
The one punished won't be me.

239
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,120
Wait.

240
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:37,519
Miss Shen,

241
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,919
can you enter the room yourself?

242
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,320
I'm fine.

243
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,160
You can go.

244
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,200
Miss.

245
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:11,399
Okay.

246
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:12,239
Let's talk next time.

247
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,160
Is she in her room?

248
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:20,919
Miss,

249
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:22,480
did you call me here for something?

250
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:24,479
I didn't.

251
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:27,039
Didn't you send Chunsheng
to call me over?

252
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,440
You good-for-nothing.

253
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,919
How did you fail such a simple task?

254
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,120
Xingkai just found an excuse to leave.

255
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,720
And Chunsheng sent you away.

256
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:44,239
Something happened.

257
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,680
Get me another cup.

258
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,000
Excuse me.

259
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,320
Thanks.

260
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:56,720
Yes?

261
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,960
Where is Miss Shen
from the Ruyi Theater?

262
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,120
Miss Shen? I don't know.

263
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:02,185
Oh.

264
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:04,639
Thank you.

265
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:05,519
