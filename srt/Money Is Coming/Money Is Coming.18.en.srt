=Episode 18=

17
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,200
A war report has arrived
from the northern frontier.

18
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,120
Beiqiong has mobilized its troops.

19
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,720
It's time to teach

20
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,960
these petty scoundrels a lesson.

21
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,840
In my absence,

22
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,200
you must be cautious.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,560
I've left troops at home for you.

24
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:43,960
Don't fear offending others.

25
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,920
Use them if necessary.

26
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,400
If you encounter difficulties,

27
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,720
let the Crown Prince handle it.

28
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,430
If he can't resolve it,

29
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,590
just endure it.

30
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,950
Wait for me to return
and seek justice for you.

31
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,400
Old man, stop worrying about me.

32
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:01,800
The battlefield is dangerous.

33
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:03,480
You must take care of yourself.

34
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:05,250
I'm counting on you to return safely

35
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,320
and back me up from the battlefield.

36
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:10,150
Rest assured.

37
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:14,160
Your father is a fierce general.

38
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,560
Wait for my triumphant return.

39
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,380
(The next day)

40
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:37,030
- Mei, the year is going to end.
- Your Grace.

41
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,600
- We should make some purchases.
- Your Grace.

42
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,150
And we should start making new clothes.

43
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,320
Miss, there's no need to spend so much.

44
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,120
We maids get new clothes made

45
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,720
each season.

46
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,960
Alright, with the old man away,

47
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,320
this is my first time managing things.

48
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,320
We must make this year festive.

49
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,880
Listen to me on this.

50
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,880
(She's just everywhere.)

51
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,640
Seems like I'll have the fortune

52
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,160
of calling you "sister".

53
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,320
Ridiculous! We are neither
sisters nor close friends.

54
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,300
Where do you get the audacity
to call me "sister"?

55
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,360
When you marry the Third Prince,

56
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,880
I'll surely have the chance

57
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,410
of calling you that.

58
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,160
What nonsense are you spouting?

59
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,520
Ning Chuxi, don't blame me
for being ruthless.

60
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,640
It's you who stands in my way.

61
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,000
Help!

62
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,840
Her Grace has been abducted!

63
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,360
Princess Yuexi has been abducted!

64
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,080
Someone help!

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,240
What are you yelling about?
Where's Her Grace?

66
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,570
Someone barged in,

67
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,720
and directly went for her.

68
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,400
They took her away.

69
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,920
I couldn't stop them.

70
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,760
Guards!

71
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,800
Surround Yuchang Pavilion.

72
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,200
No one is allowed to enter or leave.

73
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,780
You take men to search the entire city.

74
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,240
If you're short on people,
go mobilize the troops.

75
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,500
Search outside the city as well.

76
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,520
And send someone to notify
the Crown Prince.

77
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,440
Yes!

78
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,000
(This abduction)

79
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,600
(looks premeditated.)

80
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,120
(I feel completely weak.)

81
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,120
(Even moving a finger is difficult now,)

82
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,200
(let alone calling for help.)

83
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,360
Who's in the carriage?

84
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,960
Sir, it's my newly bought wife inside.

85
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,100
(What is Lin Yudai planning?)

86
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,760
The physician said she's beyond cure.

87
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,320
I'm going to bury her
at the mass graves.

88
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,080
Be careful, sir.
This illness is contagious.

89
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,120
You should watch out.

90
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,880
She convulses when it acts up.

91
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,600
Probably she bumped into
a chest or something.

92
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,440
Want to take a look, sir?

93
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,760
Go now! So unlucky!

94
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,810
Thank you, sir!

95
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:02,100
- Thank you, sir!
- Thank you, sir!

96
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,520
(If they take me to the wilderness,
then I won't escape.)

97
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,200
Spies are everywhere in the city.

98
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,050
They can't hide a person here.

99
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,240
They won't linger in the city for long.

100
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,450
Take men and search the outskirts.

101
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,360
Yes.

102
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,960
Hurry up, I'm still waiting.

103
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,160
Sure. Keep watch.

104
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,960
This woman's got delicate skin.

105
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,400
Let me check her out first.

106
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,400
Be quick about it.

107
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,240
Alright.

108
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,560
Alright, stop wasting your energy.

109
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,560
This paralysis powder can
knock out a dozen strong horses,

110
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,200
let alone a frail young lady like you.

111
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,200
Go ahead and shout.

112
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,200
Can't even make a sound, can you?

113
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:44,460
You'll be crying later.

114
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,600
You...

115
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,680

I was just following orders!

139
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,920
I thought you were just

Go to sleep. When you wake,

148
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:23,280
I told you,
you're not protected by Prince Ning.

149
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,810
You have me too.

150
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,960
These hands

151
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,800
killed someone for the first time.

152
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,920
(Just a while ago,)

153
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,400
(I was still vomiting after seeing)

154
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,500
(Xiao Xingheng
kill someone in front of me.)

155
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,760
(Now, I can kill someone
with my own hands.)

156
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,200
(I've really grown.)

157
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,960
You're awake.

158
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,750
Why are you here?

159
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:31,750
I was afraid you'd wake up
wanting to see me.

160
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,800
So, I came over.

161
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,680
I'm fine.

162
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,880
Luckily, the physician said
it's just a superficial wound,

163
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,720
nothing serious.

164
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,280
Are you scared?

165
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,840
Do you know?

166
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,680
When that sword came down,

167
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,600
both my hands were trembling.

168
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,920
No, I was watching you the whole time.

169
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,280
You weren't shaking.

170
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,840
You were decisive

171
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,280
and very brave.

172
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,000
But why do I feel like

173
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,520
my hands are still trembling now?

174
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,120
Look,

175
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,160
I'm holding them.

176
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,120
They won't tremble.

177
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,120
Don't worry.

178
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:46,480
I'm fine. I'm just not used to it yet.

179
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,120
What could happen to me?

180
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,560
Do you think I'd kill myself?

181
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,680
Lin Yudai thinks
she can force me to die like this.

182
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,000
She's too naive.

183
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,240
I won't die, Xiao Xingheng.

184
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,360
I've never been a virtuous martyr.

185
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:17,300
Virtue means nothing to me.

186
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,440
Even if I was insulted at that time,

187
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,840
I wouldn't seek death.

188
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,880
Nothing is more important
than my life.

189
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,960
So, look clearly.

190
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:36,040
This is how selfish I am.

191
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:39,930
I won't feel ashamed
for being humiliated

192
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:41,290
or losing my purity.

193
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,720
I never think it's my fault.

194
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,150
If you can't accept that, you...

195
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,100
Ning Chuxi.

196
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,760
Ning Chuxi,

197
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:00,480
listen to me.

198
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:02,720
If you ever get hurt,

199
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,680
it must be because of my incompetence

200
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,560
and that I failed to protect you.

201
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,640
You're absolutely right.

202
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,280
Under any circumstances, at any time,

203
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,000
your life is the most important.

204
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:18,800
As long as you come back safely,

205
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:22,010
nothing else matters.

206
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,920
Ning Chuxi,

207
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:26,920
you must remember.

208
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,520
I love you

209
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,920
without any reason

210
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,480
