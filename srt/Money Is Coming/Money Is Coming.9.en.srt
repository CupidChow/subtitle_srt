=Episode 9=

17
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,440
Today, the Crown Prince
is ordered to host a banquet.

18
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,680
Hurry and go to show your presence.

19
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,760
Does he really need me

20
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,440
to make an appearance?

21
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,480
Why don't you go?

22
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,730
Isn't that a joke?

23
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:35,810
Wouldn't my presence

24
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,750
just give those foreigners
a chance to show off?

25
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,920
Then I won't go either.

26
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,200
No. You represent our family.

27
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,080
You must go and make an appearance.

28
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,680
I represent you?

29
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,360
Fine, I'll go get ready.

30
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:06,500
(Xingchen Palace)

31
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,640
(Others might mistake this)

32
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,120
(for a marketplace instead.)

33
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,920
Your Grace, why you've arrived so late?

34
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,480
How can the highlight arrive first?

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,320
His Highness has been
sending people to ask about you

36
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,640
over a dozen times.

37
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,920
We are all anxious for him.

38
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,160
Alright, alright.

39
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,280
Wasn't this a banquet for the envoys?

40
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,840
Why are there so many people here?

41
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,040
Chuxi.

42
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,000
You don't know,
because of His Highness's illness,

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,240
he hasn't hosted a banquet for years.

44
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,400
This time,

45
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,280
taking advantage of this chance,

46
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,560
many families sent greeting cards.

47
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,080
His Highness had to
send out invitations to all.

48
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,880
Mumu, you are truly everywhere.

49
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,000
It's all thanks to your teaching.

50
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,560
I go wherever the excitement is.

51
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,680
Is this also the first time in years

52
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,600
that His Majesty asked
the Crown Prince to host a banquet?

53
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,400
Yes, indeed.

54
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:13,960
There's also a rumor outside that

55
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,440
His Majesty arranged this

56
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,000
so that the princes and nobles
can choose brides.

57
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,200
No wonder there are so many

58
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,720
young ladies dressed in vibrant colors.

59
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,080
None of these ladies can compare to you.

60
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,280
Shh, keep it down.

61
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,160
I'm terribly sorry. Please forgive me.

62
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,240
Your Grace.

63
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,800
Your Grace.

64
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,080
That little maid is not from

65
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,500
the Crown Prince's residence, right?

66
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,840
That maid did look a bit unfamiliar.

67
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,240
Do you mean...

68
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,560
Understood. Please take your seat first.

69
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,840
I will investigate immediately.

70
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,880
I'm going too. There might be
something interesting.

71
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,560
Your Grace, greetings.

72
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,300
(Xingchen Palace)

73
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,160
- Please.
- Please.

74
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,720
New gossip again.

75
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,000
She... Isn't she...

76
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,880
She's Prince Ning's daughter,
so give up.

77
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,950
Your Grace,
I'm deeply honored by your favor,

78
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:27,120
and will not fail
to reciprocate your affection.

79
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,770
Are you drunk?

80
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,480
It's a private matter between us.

81
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,000
Stay out of this.

82
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,350
We have never met before.

83
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,480
Why did you say such things?

84
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,120
Just earlier,
you exchanged messages with me.

85
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,320
And now you're denying it all?

86
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,920
Princess Yuexi has actually fallen
for the son of Lord Luanyang

87
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,440
and even exchanged messages?

88
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,280
That's shattering revelation!

89
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,120
This news is quite thrilling.

90
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,880
What kind of messages?
Is there evidence?

91
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,400
You didn't write to me personally,

92
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,640
but sent a handkerchief
through your maid as a token.

93
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,880
Those words of admiration for me

94
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,960
were all conveyed by your maid.

95
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,500
(Yuexi)

96
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:20,520
I thought it was just drunken nonsense,

97
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,960
but he actually has a token.

98
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,280
Mr. Chen, you must be mistaken.

99
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:28,930
I attended the banquet today
with a close friend.

100
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,590
Mr. Chen, take a closer look.

101
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:33,320
Is there such a maid
who delivered the handkerchief?

102
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,160
This...

103
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,400
Perhaps you had a maid

104
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,600
from Linhua Palace deliver it
to divert attention.

105
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,880
Moreover, the handkerchief
belongs to you.

106
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,040
This can't be wrong, can it?

107
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,400
Mr. Chen, you must be joking.

108
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,160
For such a private matter,

109
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,120
why would I

110
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,120
find a complete stranger
to send a message for me?

111
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,320
Moreover, I'm not that naive

112
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,440
like you.

113
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,950
How can you prove
that handkerchief isn't yours?

114
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:04,360
It even has your name
embroidered on it.

115
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,600
Because

116
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,800
this handkerchief is mine.

117
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,400
Your Grace, could it be that

118
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,150
you just picked
a random maid's handkerchief

119
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,200
and claimed it as your own?

120
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,200
It's Starry Brocade.

121
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,550
The same material you wore
at the flower viewing banquet.

122
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,720
It's two-colored embroidery.

123
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,640
This craftsmanship is simply exquisite.

124
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,600
This is the handkerchief I usually use.

125
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,440
As for the one you're holding,

126
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:45,160
the embroidery is mediocre,
not to my taste at all.

127
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:46,560
This...

128
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,800
But what if you prepared
two handkerchiefs?

129
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,920
If I were foolish enough

130
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,480
to embroider my name on it,

131
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,230
would I need to prepare
an additional handkerchief?

132
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:04,240
By the way, Miss Lin,
if you still have doubts,

133
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,320
why not ask His Highness

134
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,200
to seal off all entrances
and exits of the residence,

135
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,720
and thoroughly search for the maid
who delivered the handkerchief

136
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,490
to see whose maid she is?

137
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,180
I would also like to know

138
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,830
who's accusing me like this.

139
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,680
This is a banquet hosted
for envoys from various countries.

140
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,120
Sealing off the residence

141
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,920
just to find one maid

142
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,440
might not be appropriate.

143
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,350
What's inappropriate about it?

144
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,840
Your Highness.

145
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,680
Xingheng.

146
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,120
At my residence,

147
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,410
someone's falsely accusing Her Grace.

148
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,520
I cannot shirk responsibility for this.

149
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,990
I must clear Her Grace's name.

150
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,320
Master, Her Grace said
she just lost a handkerchief,

151
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,100
we don't need to make things
difficult for that maid.

152
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,880
I'm afraid

153
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,120
it's not that simple.

154
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,640
Huailiu, block all the doors

155
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,520
of the residence.

156
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,800
Take people to investigate the maids

157
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,320
and check if any intruders
have snuck in.

158
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:19,880
Yes.

159
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:34,240
Xingheng, I think we shouldn't
make a big fuss about it.

160
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,360
Everyone already knows now

161
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,480
that Princess Yuexi was falsely accused,

162
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,560
so this incident

163
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,720
won't affect her reputation.

164
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,840
Such villains
can be investigated privately.

165
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,160
If we make a grand scene now

166
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,440
to question every maid,

167
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,880
it will surely cause inconvenience

168
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,200
to all the guests attending the banquet.

169
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,880
Your Highness,
thank you for your understanding.

170
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,320
It was my lack of foresight.

171
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,440
As envoys are present,

172
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,000
it's not appropriate to seal
the residence for investigation.

173
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,920
Since Her Grace has said so,

174
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,560
I'll withdraw the order.

175
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:15,760
But I will still assist Her Grace
in finding out the truth.

176
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,650
I was deceived by others

177
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:32,050
and offended Your Grace. Please

178
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:33,080
don't hold it against me.

179
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,320
I will visit you another day
with my father to apologize.

180
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,200
Don't bother.

181
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,040
Princess Yuexi is composed
in the face of accusation,

182
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,000
organized and extraordinary
in demeanor.

183
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,760
She doesn't dwell on personal gains,

184
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,320
but is rather considerate
of the bigger picture.

185
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,440
A woman like this

186
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,440
will be a perfect wife.

187
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,680
She would surely
lead the family to prosperity.

188
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,600
Don't write this.
I'm afraid to get married.

189
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,680
What?

190
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,360
Since the problem is solved,

191
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,560
please follow me to the front hall
to enjoy the view.

192
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,360
By the way, Chuxi, why do I feel

193
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,240
the Crown Prince obeys your every word?

194
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,040
Oh no!

195
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,160
Really? No, you're overthinking it.

196
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,160
Your Grace, Miss Su.

197
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,920
The pond! Lin Yudai. Quick!

198
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:25,960
Let's go!

199
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,600
Yudai, are you okay?

200
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:33,920
Don't cry anymore.

201
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,880
Don't cry.

202
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,200
How did Yudai end up

203
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,480
falling into the pond?

204
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:43,200
Miss Lin just approached
the edge of the pond.

205
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,960
Suddenly, a servant
appeared out of nowhere

206
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,720
and bumped into her.

207
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,840
Write it down quickly.

208
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,520
Miss Lin lost her balance and fell in.

209
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,000
Where's that servant?

210
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,160
It happened so suddenly.

211
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,200
He moved fast, so I didn't see clearly.

212
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,040
Useless!

213
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,650
Although there have been rumors
about these two for a while,

214
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,340
- Don't cry.
- now in plain sight,

215
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,530
they've had physical contact.

216
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:08,040
The rumor must be true.

217
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,640
So sensational! Write it down.

218
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:16,400
The Third Prince went into the water
to save Miss Lin.

219
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,180
Even though it was an act of rescue,

220
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,640
Miss Lin's reputation is affected.

221
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,710
I wonder whether you

222
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,890
will grant Miss Lin a proper title.

223
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,200
After all, with her background

224
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,560
and her tarnished reputation,

225
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,030
she can't be your official wife.

226
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,900
It's okay now.

227
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,200
- How embarrassing!
- Exactly.

228
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,240
That's truly disgraceful.

229
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,320
Let's go.

230
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,480
Move aside.

231
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,000
Well,

232
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,360
the wife hasn't even
entered the family yet,

233
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,840
and there's already
a troublesome concubine.

234
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,160
What a headache.

235
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:09,320
A woman like this
will be a perfect wife.

236
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,090
Don't write this.
I'm afraid to get married.

237
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,240
Thank you, Your Highness.

238
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,360
For what?

239
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,720
I know there's an embroiderer
in your residence

240
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,800
who's skilled in two-colored embroidery

241
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,640
and she embroiders very quickly.

242
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,600
I was curious at the time.

243
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,880
I even asked Huailiu
to take me to observe her.

244
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,240
Oh? And so?

245
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,960
She even used

246
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,560
the Starry Brocade I once wore,

247
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,280
making it all the more convincing.

248
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:49,160
It seems he usually
pays attention to me.

249
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,760
Perhaps.
