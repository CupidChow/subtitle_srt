17
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,640
(Isn't this the man in black)

18
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,800
(I met on the way back to the capital?)

19
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,360
(Worshipping Buddha by day,
killing at midnight.)

20
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,480
(This young man has two faces.)

21
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,080
This is still the old tea picked
from the back mountain last year.

22
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,120
Now spring has just arrived.

23
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,600
The new tea will still
need some time to be picked.

24
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,360
I hope you don't mind.

25
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,440
Do you have

26
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,980
an unsolved mystery in your heart?

27
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,480
You're indeed a master.

28
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,520
What do you think, if,

29
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,600
I mean, if,

30
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,360
the fixed destiny can be changed?

31
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,640
Everything depends on fate.
Just follow your heart.

32
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,440
Follow my heart?

33
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,600
This is like saying nothing at all.

34
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,920
(But all I have in my heart
is wealth and glory.)

35
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,720
Miss, these are the invitations
and greeting cards

36
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,320
we've received recently,

37
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,200
all sent after hearing that
you returned to the capital.

38
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,880
Smell it, it's all like gossip.

39
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,240
You're not going at all?

40
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,040
But Miss, you've been back
in the capital for a long time

41
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,100
and they haven't seen you.

42
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,480
People are saying ugly things now.

43
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,440
Ugly things?

44
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,560
Yes.

45
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,880
Tell me.

46
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,800
People are saying that you've been

47
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,240
pestering the Third Prince,

48
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,880
determined to marry him.

49
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,920
Pah, that's utterly nonsense.

50
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,080
They're also saying

51
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,640
Prince Ning is relying on
his laborious achievements

52
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,080
to choose a husband for his daughter,

53
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,480
and that's shameless.

54
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,960
His daughter still can't marry.

55
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,280
His Highness said...

56
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,520
What did the old man say?

57
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,920
You don't want to host

58
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,920
a welcoming banquet in the house,
and that's fine.

59
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,280
But as a princess,

60
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,520
how can you stay at home,
afraid to go out

61
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,440
and let others look down on you?

62
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,160
Yes, I can't let the old man
be looked down on.

63
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,260
(Invitation)

64
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,360
(Xiao Yue'er)
(The letters are written in gold powder.)

65
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,920
That's the one.

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,720
The Fourth Princess's
flower viewing banquet.

67
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:22,600
Yeah.

68
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,440
The Fourth Princess
is the Third Prince's,

69
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,570
and your ex's sister.

70
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,280
What good intentions can there be
at her banquet?

71
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,600
I don't care whether there's conspiracy.

72
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,040
Since we're going to a banquet,

73
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,960
let's pick the biggest one.

74
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:47,300
(Wei Garden)

75
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,480
(It smells so good.)

76
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,320
Oh.

77
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,040
Isn't this Princess Yuexi?

78
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,340
(Xiao Yue'er, Fourth Princess)

79
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,040
Don't you bow to me when you see me?

80
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,840
I won't stand on ceremony with you,

81
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,880
so you don't have to
return the greeting later.

82
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,480
We haven't seen each other
in three years.

83
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,200
You've become more sharp-tongued

84
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,600
and liked to wear these
old-fashioned clothes.

85
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,960
What's wrong?
You haven't gotten used to here?

86
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,640
You look so haggard now.

87
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,200
Is that so? But I heard
the late Empress loved pink gold

88
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,520
and often wore it to attend banquets.

89
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,040
The Emperor also praised her
for her elegance in pink gold.

90
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,080
It just so happens my grandma
also loves pink gold,

91
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,160
so she made many clothes for me
in that color.

92
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,800
She's happy when I wear them.

93
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,000
That's very touching.

94
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,320
(Su Mumu)
Is this Starry Brocade from Jinzhou?

95
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,720
(There's actually someone
who knows her stuff.)

96
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,520
The fabric shimmers with starlight

97
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,920
when it moves,

98
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,350
that's why it's named Starry Brocade.

99
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,320
Really? I didn't know that.

100
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:48,990
Aside from its unique weaving technique,

101
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,600
the silk it needs

102
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,000
can only be produced by
the mulberry silkworms of Jinzhou.

103
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,960
Its yield is only a third
of that of regular silkworms.

104
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,120
This makes Starry Brocade
very expensive and hard to find.

105
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,760
I've heard there's a saying in Jinzhou,

106
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,560
"An inch of Starry Brocade
is worth an inch of gold."

107
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,080
What? An inch of gold?

108
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,960
Is that true?

109
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,960
Princess Yuexi actually

110
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,560
made an outer garment
with Starry Brocade.

111
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,000
I wonder how much fabric it would take

112
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,040
and how much did it cost.

113
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,200
Really?

114
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,640
If I'd known Starry Brocade
was so precious,

115
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,640
I wouldn't have used it for curtains.

116
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,520
Curtains? Oh my god.

117
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,440
Go on, disperse! A group of bumpkins.

118
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,640
See you later.

119
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,220
Remarkable.

120
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,920
No wonder she's the female lead.

121
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,000
She's indeed attracting
all the attention.

122
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,840
This colorful hairpin seems to be
from the Western Regions.

123
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,560
How do you know that again?

124
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,600
You do know your stuff.

125
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,320
You're too kind, Your Grace.

126
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,640
I usually study some obscure knowledge.

127
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,480
Forgive me.

128
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,920
A bosom friend is hard to find.

129
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,440
I'll send you a set later.

130
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,560
How could I accept that, Your Grace?

131
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,360
Don't call me Your Grace.

132
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,600
Don't be so distant with me.

133
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,760
Just call me

134
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,640
"Sister", what do you think?

135
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,760
You all flatter me.

136
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,320
My qin skills are just average.

137
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,240
Princess Consort Ning
was a master of the qin.

138
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,960
Her famous piece
stirred the entire capital.

139
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,040
Yes, her mesmerizing melody

140
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,840
has been passed down to this day.

141
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,280
You're her beloved daughter.

142
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,000
You must have inherited her skills.

143
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,200
We wonder if we are fortunate

144
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,600
to hear you play a tune.

145
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,320
That's a bit of a stretch.

146
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,680
After Princess Yuexi was born,

147
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,320
Princess Consort Ning had been bedridden

148
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,320
and passed away when she was three.

149
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,520
How could she have had the time
and energy to teach her qin?

150
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,440
Exactly.

151
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,240
Since you've invited me, I can't refuse.

152
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,400
But my qin skills are poor,

153
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,520
far inferior to Miss Lin's.

154
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,760
To avoid offending your ears,

155
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,880
could Miss Lin play with me?

156
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,480
You're being humble.

157
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,760
It is my honor to play with you.

158
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,160
(Ning Chuxi,
this is what you asked for.)

159
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,720
(Don't blame me
if you embarrass yourself later.)

160
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,360
Miss Lin took the lead.

161
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,200
Didn't realize she was so competitive.

162
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,200
This is the most
technically difficult piece.

163
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,040
Miss Lin's skills are remarkable.

164
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,920
Looks like Princess Yuexi
will just be a backdrop.

165
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,960
Truly, I couldn't tell

166
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,280
Princess Yuexi's qin skills
were unexpectedly exquisite.

167
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,280
The complex emotions in this piece

168
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,200
can't be played by just any young lady.

169
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,840
Your Grace, you're surly
a daughter from a military family.

170
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,440
This piece expresses
the bravery of our frontier soldiers.

171
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,360
We will not fail the legacy
of our ancestors

172
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,040
and will spread the might
of our great Li.

173
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,000
I wonder if those surviving soldiers

174
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
ever returned to their hometown,

175
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,920
and whether they saw their beloved girl.

176
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,760
Most of the servants in my household

177
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,960
are retired soldiers and their families.

178
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,800
Inspired by

179
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,240
the stories from the frontier,

180
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,440
I composed this piece.

181
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,360
As for the qin skills,

182
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,040
just as you said,

183
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,000
are inherited from my mother.

184
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,480
I think this piece is just

185
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,460
(Xiao Xu, Third Prince)
showing off sentimentalism.

186
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,760
Xu, don't be impulsive.

187
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,640
I accidentally offended her.

188
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,850
She has the right to punish me.

189
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,960
Don' think I'll apologize to her.

190
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,720
Then, I'll hit you back.

191
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,560
(This Mary Sue appearance.)

192
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,360
(The original male lead
came to support the female lead.)

193
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,280
(Dressed like a flamboyant peacock.)

194
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,400
Yudai.

195
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,440
How careless.

196
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,640
It's not worth getting hurt

197
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,240
for such a pretentious

198
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,160
display of skill.

199
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,800
Princess Yuexi is just a young lady.

200
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,320
She doesn't even go out much.

201
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,960
How can she talk about
the soldiers on the battlefield?

202
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,720
(I really want to kill him.)

203
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,050
Who are you?

204
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,640
The Third Prince has been talking here,

205
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,480
but Princess Yuexi
didn't even recognize you.

206
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,800
This is the Third Prince, Miss.

207
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,950
You've met him when you were young.

208
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,360
The Third Prince. I apologize.

209
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,640
Your grace is still
as remarkable as ever.

210
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,960
Ning Chuxi!

211
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,920
Third Prince, forgive me.
I lack skill in the arts.

212
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,160
I've never been to the borderlands,

213
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,280
and can only learn about it

214
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,480
through the words of my servants
at home.

215
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,960
I haven't been able to show
their bravery and martial skill

216
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,440
and offended your ears.

217
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,520
I wonder if you've ever personally
visited the borderlands

218
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,360
to witness the steel resolve
of our soldiers firsthand?

219
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,960
Your Grace, the Third Prince
has never been to the battlefield.

220
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,800
You...

221
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,680
You all...

222
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,360
Ning Chuxi, if you want

223
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,800
to win my attention in this way,

224
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,400
then I advise you
to give up on this idea.

225
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,200
This is simply a hopeless fantasy.

226
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,320
Third Prince,

227
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,880
although you are of noble status,

228
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,000
you have only two eyes and one mouth.

229
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,200
I really can't see

230
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,160
where you would be worthy
of my attention.

231
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,320
Instead of wasting time
talking to me here,

232
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,040
you might as well
take Miss Lin in your arms

233
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,640
to treat her wound.

234
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,280
It's not appropriate in public.

235
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,920
It's better you think that way.

236
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,560
Yudai, let's go.

237
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,760
Fourth Princess, do you have
any more programs?

238
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,200
Everyone leave!

239
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,600
Miss, that was amazing just now.

240
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,280
You're amazing!

241
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,280
It's nothing.

242
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,920
Miss, you're really amazing.
They needed to see that.

243
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,560
Otherwise, they might think
we're easy to bully.

244
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,480
You're so amazing!

245
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,470
Your Highness.

246
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,280
Yudai, it's my fault.

247
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,240
I was delayed by something
and came late.

248
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,040
Sorry you had to suffer.

249
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,520
Upon seeing you,

250
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,120
I forget all my grievances.

251
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,360
No need to be afraid anymore.

252
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,160
With me around,
no one will dare bully you.

253
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,560
Who?

254
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,560
Let's split and meet at home.

255
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,600
Yes, Miss.

256
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:47,300
(Qinchun Pavilion)

257
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,800
Master

258
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,720
Go.

259
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,160
(Where is this place?)

260
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,760
(Why is the Wei Garden so winding?)

261
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,120
