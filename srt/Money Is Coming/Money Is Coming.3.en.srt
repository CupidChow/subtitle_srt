Not good.

39
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,700
(Qinchun Pavilion)

40
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,920
They...

41
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,880
Shh.

42
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,640
When has Master been so gentle?

43
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,240
The last time

44
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,760
was the last time.

45
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,400
There was a last time?

46
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,840
After she wakes up, send her
to Prince Ning's Residence.

47
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,680
Yes.

48
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,230
It's the first time someone has come
near him after the poison attack

49
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,400
yet remains unharmed.

50
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,950
It's also the first person

51
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:02,000
who's able to sleep soundly
even after the poison took effect.

52
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,440
(He appeared alone
in the back of Wei Garden.)

53
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,760
(Could he be the Crown Prince?)

54
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,560
Miss, you've finally woken up.

55
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,440
Mei, what are you doing here?

56
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,320
Miss, I had been waiting
at the back gate of Wei Garden

57
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,960
and didn't see you,

58
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,960
so I came to find you.

59
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,200
But there were guards
at the back courtyard's attic.

60
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,750
They said outsiders
were not allowed to enter.

61
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:53,660
I was so anxious.

62
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,660
How did you manage to get in?

63
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,200
I just...

64
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,520
Princess Yuexi,
your maid is quite something.

65
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,880
(It's him.)

66
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,800
Your maid didn't find you.

67
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,600
Our people were ordered
not to let her in.

68
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,560
She almost went back to find Prince Ning

69
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,150
to send troops
to search the entire Wei Garden.

70
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,440
This girl is loyal.

71
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,680
You must be laughing at us.

72
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,960
It's our fault.

73
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,000
Our subordinates failed to notice you

74
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,440
so your maid was worried.

75
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,920
It almost caused a misunderstanding.

76
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,160
I am Huailiu.

77
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,990
His Highness ordered me
to send you back home.

78
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,320
Thank His Highness for me.

79
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,080
Oh, by the way,

80
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,340
His Highness ordered me to give
this medicine to you.

81
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,280
It's a royal tribute

82
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,560
and the effect is several times
better than others.

83
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,240
I've instructed
the steward of Wei Garden

84
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,880
to inform the Fourth Princess
before the banquet ends

85
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,920
that you felt unwell and left early.

86
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,800
(The Crown Prince's Mansion
is truly meticulous.)

87
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,120
(Why didn't she ask about Master?)

88
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,680
With such obvious injuries,

89
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,920
why she looks like nothing happened?

90
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,320
She's not curious about
the Crown Prince's identity

91
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,840
nor does she ask about his whereabouts.

92
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,000
She didn't even ask about
the cause of the injury.

93
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,840
Princess Yuexi doesn't seem
as brainless as the rumors suggest.

94
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,520
She's quite composed.

95
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,560
No matter who it is,

96
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,170
as long as she eases
Master's poisoning pain,

97
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:37,720
she's our benefactor.

98
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:51,470
It hurts.

99
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:52,680
I'll rub it for you.

100
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,960
Anyway, that's how things went.

101
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,080
So the Crown Prince might be
suffering from a serious illness?

102
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,600
I'm not sure either.

103
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,770
But from what I observed,

104
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,920
it actually looks more like...

105
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,200
poisoning.

106
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,240
(It doesn't look like a terrible disease,)

107
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,040
(rather, it seems more
like being drugged.)

108
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,360
(He seems to be in)

109
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,320
(a nearly uncontrollable, violent state.)

110
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,640
No matter the reason,

111
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,840
the Crown Prince has been too harsh.

112
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,950
You have these bruises and marks.

113
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,050
With such a big bite mark on your neck,

114
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,840
how will you go out these days?

115
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,480
I don't want to go out.

116
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,040
But don't tell the old man

117
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,240
in case he gets worried.

118
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,240
Also, make sure to hide that cloak.

119
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,440
Don't let others see it.

120
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:49,840
Don't worry, I got it.

121
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:54,060
(The next day)

122
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,840
Miss, someone has sent
something for you.

123
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,000
For me?

124
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,240
The doorman said it was sent
by the steward of Wei Garden.

125
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:05,000
They said you lost something
in Wei Garden yesterday

126
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,860
and specially delivered it to you.

127
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:08,100
Let me see.

128
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:15,130
(The Crown Prince is so generous.)

129
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,370
Miss, this is...

130
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,760
I was rude yesterday.

131
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,160
Would you kindly come to Wei Garden

132
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,360
and allow me to offer my apologies?

133
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,240
Take the gold.

134
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:29,200
I'll think about the invitation.

135
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:30,060
Oh.

136
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,280
(I can't get away with anything
that's supposed to happen.)

137
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,800
Your Grace,
Master is waiting for you in the attic.

138
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,680
Mei, wait for me here.

139
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,620
You don't need to go up.

140
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,480
Okay, Miss.

141
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,160
(This is crazy.)

142
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,240
(I've never backed down from anything,)

143
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,650
(even from Xiao Xu.)

144
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,160
(But I'm a bit intimidated
by Xiao Xingheng.)

145
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,780
(No, though he is scary,)

146
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:36,090
(somehow, he fits my taste.)

147
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:38,640
(It makes resisting him a bit hard.)

148
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,560
Your Grace, please.

149
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,700
Today, I invited you here

150
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,460
mainly to offer my apologies.

151
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,220
I unintentionally hurt you yesterday.

152
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,260
I am truly sorry.

153
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:51,900
(Sorry?)

154
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,780
(When you attacked,)

155
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,100
(you showed no mercy.)

156
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,220
I have already accepted your gifts.

157
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,420
I don't know what you like,

158
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,950
so, I can only send some simple things
as a token of my apology.

159
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,140
Your Highness, you are very generous.

160
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,180
I quite like them,

161
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,100
so I'll take the gifts.

162
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,820
Your Highness, you invited me today

163
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,460
probably not just to apologize, right?

164
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,400
You are very perceptive.

165
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,300
I'm sure you have doubts

166
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,420
about what happened yesterday.

167
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,010
I actually suffer from a chronic illness.

168
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:32,740
During an attack,
I lose my sense of clarity.

169
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,100
The pain in my head becomes unbearable.

170
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,780
When it gets severe,
I may harm others or myself.

171
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:39,660
(Is this something)

172
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,740
(I should know about?)

173
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,500
(I specially didn't ask about
the cause of your madness.)

174
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,900
(Isn't it nice to play dumb?)

175
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,580
So...

176
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:51,500
So, I have a request to make.

177
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,180
Though I unintentionally
hurt you yesterday,

178
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,740
I've realized that

179
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,460
you can calm me down

180
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,860
during my episodes.

181
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:03,060
So I specially invited you today
to treat me.

182
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,420
To treat you?
