17
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:28,250
I've dealt with all the spies

18
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,850
you placed in my residence.

19
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,490
I didn't act before
out of respect for my uncle.

20
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,800
But you shouldn't have

21
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,400
revealed my schedule to Bai Queyue

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,850
and gave her illusions
she shouldn't have had.

23
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,320
Is this how you speak
to your grandfather?

24
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,560
It is precisely because
you're my grandfather

25
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,450
that I can stand here
and speak with you.

26
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,660
Have your wings grown strong now?

27
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,240
For the sake of a woman,

28
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,460
you come questioning
your grandfather late at night.

29
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,560
To be honest,

30
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,620
she is far more important than you.

31
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:09,610
You...

32
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,760
Princess Yuexi has Prince Ning's support

33
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,060
and she saved your life.

34
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,920
I don't oppose your marrying her.

35
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:33,720
But Queyue was intended
to be your legitimate wife.

36
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:39,120
She's carefully nurtured from childhood,
and is most suited to you.

37
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,000
Now, due to Princess Yuexi,
she cannot be your wife,

38
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,680
but you can still take her in.

39
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,320
My marriage

40
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,440
isn't for you to decide, Grandfather.

41
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,120
It's all for your own good.

42
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,200
I've already complied with your wishes.

43
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,320
What more do you want?

44
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,120
For my good?

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,320
For my good, you sent me to Liu Kingdom.

46
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,120
For my good, you totally ignored me.

47
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,880
Was it really for my good

48
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,880
or for yourself

49
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,880
and your family?

50
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,760
You still resent me

51
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:35,880
for sending you to Liu Kingdom
as a hostage.

52
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,600
But I've never regretted that decision.

53
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,880
The Duke of State's residence
had lost its military power

54
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,360
and was a lamb at the mercy of others.

55
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,980
Yes, sacrificing one nephew

56
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:55,350
reduced His Majesty's suspicions of you

57
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:58,130
and gained years of stability
for the family.

58
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,680
It was indeed a fair trade.

59
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,840
However,

60
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,500
do you not regret Mother's death?

61
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:18,450
Your mother was too gentle.

62
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:23,680
She was not suited
for such a deceitful place.

63
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,960
She was not suited?

64
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,360
Don't forget

65
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,960
it was you who sent her to that place.

66
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:35,120
You still resent me.

67
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,150
I resented you when I was young.

68
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,270
But now, I don't.

69
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:56,560
If you fear I'll take revenge for this,

70
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,960
then you can rest assured.

71
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,240
As long as you stay in line,

72
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,360
in honor of my mother and uncle,

73
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,800
the things you care most about
won't change

74
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,790
and your family will continue to thrive.

75
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:17,110
But as for other matters,

76
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,690
don't even think about it.

77
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,100
The Bai family will not
produce another Empress.

78
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,080
The royal family will never again

79
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,400
have a child with the Bai family's
blood running in the veins.

80
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:29,750
You...

81
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,330
Don't delude yourself.

82
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:36,960
Xingheng.

83
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,610
Xingheng, did you
say something to Uncle?

84
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,980
Was it something Princess Yuexi said?

85
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,720
I didn't, Xingheng, I really didn't.

86
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,960
You shouldn't have provoked her.

87
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:55,760
Xingheng.

88
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,280
I knew since I was nine
that I would marry you.

89
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,160
All these years,
I have worked towards

90
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,840
becoming a good wife to you.

91
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,320
I heard Uncle say
you're going to marry Princess Yuexi.

92
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,450
I don't want to fight her for anything.

93
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,440
I don't need a title.

94
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,600
To me,

95
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,170
it has always been only her.

96
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,440
Ning.

97
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,200
- Mumu.
- I heard the Crown Prince

98
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,280
has sealed off ten miles
around the entire Wei Garden

99
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,730
and declared it'll only be open to you.

100
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,090
Is that true?

101
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,560
So, you visit me

102
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,210
just to dig for gossip?

103
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:45,680
Ning, you don't understand.

104
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:50,600
Our "Capital Stories" is just shy
of becoming the best seller.

105
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,360
How many stories does it need?

106
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,100
Just you and the Crown Prince.

107
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,840
Then go ahead and ask.

108
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,460
Do you like His Highness?

109
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,360
That's a tricky question!

110
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,840
My dear friend, please!

111
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:19,220
Answer me!

112
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:26,920
Xiao Xingheng is different from me.

113
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:31,240
He is the Crown Prince
and will be the Emperor.

114
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,360
Ordinary people are accustomed
to having multiple wives,

115
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:38,030
let alone the Crown Prince.

116
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,780
But that doesn't stop you
from liking him.

117
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,240
I don't want to spend
the rest of my life

118
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,870
fighting for favor and power
in the harem

119
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,430
just for the so-called love.

120
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,890
Even the deepest feelings
will eventually be worn out.

121
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,480
I'm just a slacker.

122
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,040
I have no ambitions or aspirations.

123
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,600
I just want to eat, drink, and live freely,

124
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:04,150
living a carefree life.

125
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,480
(But Xiao Xingheng is outside my plan.)

126
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,280
(He's a temptation I couldn't resist.)

127
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,920
Why is love so frustrating?

128
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,900
Why are you sighing
in the middle of the night?

129
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,050
You're such a toxic friend.

130
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,750
What sneaky thing are you doing

131
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,640
in the middle of the night?

132
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,240
Visiting you is not a sneaky thing.

133
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,760
It might hurt a little.

134
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,080

What flower is this?

170
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,100
Iris flower.

171
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:58,850
Iris?

172
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:04,040
So you came in the middle of the night

173
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,090
just to forcefully tattoo an iris on me?

00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,080

175
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,770
Do you know the meaning of an iris?

I don't want it to leave

179
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,080
so, I modified it for you.

(You're such a perfectionist.)

181
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,840

182
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,880
(Why don't you get one yourself?)

183
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,080
Iris

184
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,920
symbolizes undying love
and predestined lovers.

185
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,800
Unwavering in this life,

186
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,330
unforgettable in the next.

187
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,880
She is his destined lover.

188
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,110
Publish it, publish it.

189
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,850
This time, my book
will be the best seller.

190
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,600
I'm very sorry

191
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,760
about Bai Queyue.

192
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,040
It won't happen again.

193
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:03,660
(Why mention her?)

194
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,410
(My good mood is ruined again.)

195
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,250
Also,

196
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
don't overthink it.

197
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:17,080
To me, you're the most important.

198
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:22,880
(I'll know the outcome
if I keep going.)

199
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,800
(Midway hesitation
only adds unnecessary trouble.)

200
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,330
Xiao Xingheng,

201
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:39,640
when did you start liking me?

202
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,250
Why are you suddenly asking this?

203
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,960
It's not me who wants to know.

204
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,970
Mumu wants to know.

205
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:50,860
Yes.

206
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:51,960
It's her who wants to know.

207
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,240
Shut up.

208
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,960
Princess Jielan, I just observed
your appearance up close.

209
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,480
In terms of looks, you're just average.

210
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,480
In terms of virtue,

211
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,120
you clearly lack of character.

212
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,080
You are just an illegitimate princess
from a defeated country.

213
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,040
Who gave you the courage

214
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,720
to criticize and pick on
our Crown Prince?

215
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,400
Take a look in the mirror.

216
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,140
Are you worthy of that?

217
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:23,720
That's all?

218
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,440
It's like being misunderstood
didn't make you sad at all.

219
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,120
Suddenly, someone stands up for you,
and you feel aggrieved.

220
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:40,660
At this moment,
you want to tell the world,

221
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:42,000
"Look,

222
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:45,290
someone knows you're not wrong."

223
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:48,720
Xiao Xingheng,

224
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,840
at lease to me, you'll always

225
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:53,110
be better than others.

226
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,350
But don't be cocky,
you still have many flaws.

227
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,320
Do I have many flaws?

228
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:19,690
Yes, a lot.

229
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,930
As many as the stars in the sky.

230
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,640
What about my strengths?

231
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,130
As few as the sun.

232
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,880
Then why do you like me?

233
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,470
Because when the sun rises,

234
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,880
all the stars grow dim.

235
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,400
So

236
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,560
Chuxi, you like me too,

237
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,560
don't you?

238
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,560
Let's talk about it next time.

239
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:05,270
Master Huiku said

240
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:09,480
the antidote for Dream Drunkenness
will be ready tomorrow.

241
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,240
Tomorrow?

242
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:12,800
Then I'll go with you.

243
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:20,890
Alright.

244
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,930
Don't look at me.

245
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,010
