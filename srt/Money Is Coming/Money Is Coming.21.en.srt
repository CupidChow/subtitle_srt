16

=Episode 21=

17
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,400
Her Grace has arrived.

18
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,180
Princess Yuexi,
I didn't know you were coming.

19
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,100
Sorry for failing to greet you earlier.

20
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:31,580
Mr. Zhao, you're too polite.

21
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,500
I came unannounced.
Sorry for disturbing you.

22
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:35,690
Not at all.

23
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,140
You're too kind, Your Grace.

24
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:40,150
My visit is concerning the plague.

25
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:43,050
To be honest, Your Grace,

26
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,540
after I received your message,

27
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,900
I had physicians confirm the plague

28
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,700
and immediately
reported it to the court.

29
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,180
But Yizhou is far from the capital,

30
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,840
so I haven't received any orders.

31
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:58,060
But the people
are still gathering together,

32
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:00,810
and the plague will only spread worse.

33
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:04,260
Yizhou lies deep in Jiangnan,

34
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,100
with few soldiers stationed.

35
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,570
If the people learn about the plague,

36
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,600
and a riot occurs,

37
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,050
we won't be able to contain it.

38
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,820
But Mr. Zhao, do you know

39
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:19,850
that it's not just Yizhou?

40
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,860
If the plague spreads out of the city

41
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,820
during the wait for orders,

42
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,660
and affects other regions,

43
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:29,340
it won't just be a riot to worry about.

44
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,140
His Highness has said

45
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,300
seeing this seal
is as if seeing him in person.

46
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,820
But do you still recognize this seal?

47
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:49,780
(I thought the Crown Prince)

48
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,500
(is merely marrying Princess Yuexi
to forge an alliance.)

49
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,660
(Didn't expect him
to trust her this much,)

50
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,580
(and even gave her his private seal.)

51
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,320
Please instruct, Your Grace.

52
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,810
I will act upon your orders.

53
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:05,660
The priority
is to seal Yizhou's city gates

54
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,420
to prevent the plague
from spreading out.

55
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,380
Your Grace, it's too late for that.

56
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,980
I have just received news

57
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,060
that the city gates have already
been sealed from the outside.

58
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,540
Currently, no one can get out

59
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,220
of Yizhou.

60
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:32,780
This fast?

61
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,900
From the capital to Yizhou,

62
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,710
it'd take at least ten days
to deliver a message

63
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,380
whether by courier at top speed

64
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,340
or by pigeon posts.

65
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,300
The news of the lockdown
arrived today,

66
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,480
which means at least ten days ago,

67
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,060
the capital knew of the Yizhou plague.

68
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,300
Back then, Yizhou had just begun

69
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,740
seeing more funerals.

70
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:58,570
Is this foresight from someone

71
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:02,620
or could this plague
have been a premeditated scheme?

72
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,500
The others have also been delivered.

73
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,580
Sir, the citizens

74
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,460
somehow learned about the plague

75
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,100
and are now gathering
at the quarantine site,

76
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,200
demanding to leave the city.

77
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,500
The guards threaten to kill them
if they attempt to leave.

78
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,780
We can barely hold them back.

79
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,980
Let us out! We want to leave!

80
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:51,460
- We want to leave the city!
- We want to leave!

81
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,300
Let us out!

82
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,380
Yizhou has a population
of tens of thousands.

83
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,420
If a riot is caused by the plague,

84
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:02,320
even the garrison of three cities
may not be able to hold it off.

85
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:05,220
Please dispatch troops
for preemptive suppression.

86
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,020
In my view, plagues have always

87
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,580
resulted in many deaths.

88
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:10,900
This is a natural disaster,

89
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,740
not something humans can cure.

90
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,060
To prevent further spread
and casualties,

91
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,740
Yizhou must be sealed off completely.

92
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,450
No one should be allowed
to leave the city.

93
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:23,900
Yizhou lies in the heart of Jiangnan,
and is flourishing in trade.

94
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:27,270
With ample farmlands
and a large population,

95
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,460
if the city is abandoned,
corpses will pile up,

96
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,300
farmlands will go untended,

97
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:35,060
and trade will be neglected.

98
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,780
This will be a devastating loss
for our dynasty.

99
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,120
In critical times,
one must cut their losses.

100
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:43,070
Even if the cost is significant,

101
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,390
but it can

102
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,660
ensure the safety of citizens
in nearby counties.

103
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:51,080
Moreover, with the plague
rampant in Yizhou,

104
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,540
who would dare

105
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,060
to enter the city for aid?

106
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,210
Who says no one will?

107
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,240
His Majesty is wise.

108
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,890
I'd like to see
which ill-intentioned people

109
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:05,290
dares to abandon my homeland.

110
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,540
I have fulfilled my mission.

111
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:14,580
Beiqiong's commander has withdrawn.

112
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,300
Only a small garrison remains
to guard the border,

113
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,940
and they no longer pose a threat.

114
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:21,900
We've won a landslide victory!

115
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:26,180
Good! You have worked hard.

116
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,260
I will reward you generously.

117
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:31,150
I only did my duty.

118
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,810
On my way back to the capital,
I heard about Yizhou's severe plague.

119
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,840
My heart was uneasy, so I rushed here

120
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:42,060
and didn't have time to change.
I beg your forgiveness.

121
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,260
No matter.

122
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,260
It's natural for you
to worry about your family.

123
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,750
Why should there be any guilt in that?

124
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,060
Since you have returned,

125
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:55,580
do you have any countermeasures
for the plague in Yizhou?

126
00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:00,580
Your Majesty, I believe we must
station heavy troops for defense.

127
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,610
This will prevent
the spread of the plague

128
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,530
and riots among the citizens.

129
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:08,600
But Yizhou cannot be abandoned.

130
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:12,600
If Yizhou is abandoned,
the people will live in fear

131
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:15,700
and riots may arise.

132
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:22,420
If Yizhou is expendable,
then any city can be abandoned.

133
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,380
If this precedent is set

134
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,860
and the plague spreads uncontrollably,

135
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,980
then we won't be able to save anyone

136
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,580
or protect a single city.

137
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,620
The loss will be enormous.

138
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:39,420
Your Majesty, please do not do that.

139
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,300
That's easy for you to say.

140
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:45,840
The plague in Yizhou
is rampant and severe.

141
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:48,380
How many people
are willing to risk their lives

142
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,050
to enter the city
and provide assistance?

143
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,420
I am willing to go.

144
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,380
But you alone will not suffice.

145
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:59,100
If we are to send people,
we must dispatch reinforcements.

146
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:03,020
But the troops are stationed
far away at the borders.

147
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,540
The royal guards need to
protect His Majesty's safety.

148
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,460
They cannot be mobilized lightly.

149
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,700
I have returned victorious this time.

150
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,580
I granted leave
to the Northern Frontier troops

151
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,020
who've long been away from home.

152
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,860
They're now stationed outside the city

153
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,420
and I have not disbanded them yet.

154
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,160
How many did you bring?

155
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,620
Fifty thousand.

156
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:28,220
You brought troops into the capital
without permission.

157
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,740
Are you deaf?

158
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:32,260
I merely granted leave to the soldiers

159
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,340
to accompany me back to the capital.

160
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:37,420
And I hastily came to meet His Majesty,

161
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:40,420
so they haven't been disbanded yet.

162
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:44,020
You've just returned from the frontline.

163
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,940
You should rest for a while.

164
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,960
The situation in Yizhou
is still unclear.

165
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:54,020
You absolutely must not risk your life.

166
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,060
How about this,

167
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:02,580
I'll send another man to lead
your elite soldiers to provide aid.

168
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,040
What do you think?

169
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,500
This...

170
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,750
I'm willing to go
in place of Prince Ning.

171
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,700
You are the Crown Prince.

172
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,140
How can you risk your life?

173
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,380
Precisely because I'm the Crown Prince,

174
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,180
I must take responsibility
for the well-being of all citizens.

175
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:31,180
Yizhou is not only home to my beloved,

176
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,980
but also tens of thousands
of our citizens.

177
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:36,860
(Very well, entrusting the troops
to the Crown Prince)

178
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:39,170
(leaves Prince Ning
with nothing to contest.)

179
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:40,310
In that case,

180
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,180
you may lead the elite soldiers

181
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,980
and head to Yizhou for disaster relief.

182
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,260
Yes.

183
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,540
Thanks to your letter,

184
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,300
I was able to bring back
so many soldiers

185
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,380
so Yizhou won't become an isolated city.

186
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,500
I still owe my thanks to Her Grace.

187
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:02,900
Since Chuxi thinks so highly of you,

188
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,820
I will speak frankly.

189
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,380
Please speak.

190
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:10,060
I will deal with these troublemakers
in the capital.

191
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,780
But you must promise

192
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,300
to bring Chuxi back safely from Yizhou.

193
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,780
Please rest assured,
I will protect her with my life.

194
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,780
Good.

195
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,830
Let us out!

196
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,020
Why are you stopping us?

197
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,940
Your Grace,
though the city gates are sealed,

198
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,700
I have a way to get you out.

199
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,420
You may get me out alone,

200
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,620
but can you take
the entire Ning family out?

201
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,860
Let us out! We want to leave!

202
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,500
Let us out!

203
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,210
We're leaving!

204
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:39,980
Let us out!

205
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:43,220
- The magistrate is here!
- The magistrate is here!

206
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,460
Mr. Zhao, why is Yizhou sealed off?

207
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,900
There's a plague here,
and you won't let us flee?

208
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,260
Has the court abandoned us?

209
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:53,400
Let me out! I don't want to die here!

210
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,130
Are you trying to kill us?

211
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,600
We want to leave the city!

212
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,620
Everyone!

213
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:58,860
Everyone!

214
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,700
Please listen to me!

215
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:04,860
Yizhou is sealed off to prevent
the plague from spreading

216
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,800
and to ensure the safety
of many more people.

217
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:10,180
The court's aid is already on its way.

218
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,340
It will arrive soon.

219
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:15,540
For now, everyone must
cooperate with the authorities

220
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,540
and reduce gatherings

221
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,540
to prevent the plague
from infecting more people.

222
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:22,780
You're lying! The soldiers said
those who leave will be killed.

223
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,380
You're clearly
trying to trap us to death.

224
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,100
You don't care about us at all!

225
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,820
- Let us out!
- Yes, exactly.

226
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,610
Let us out!

227
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,500
The nobles have already fled the city,

228
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,500
leaving us poor commoners behind.

229
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,620
You clearly disregard human lives!

230
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,500
That's right,
they disregard human lives!

231
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,740
I am still in the city.

232
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:44,260
Before today, no outsiders

233
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,780
were aware of the plague.

234
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,780
It's utter nonsense to say

235
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,900
people left beforehand.

236
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,780
Mr. Zhao, are you saying

237
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,720
you knew Yizhou had the plague,

238
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,420
and deliberately hid it
from us commoners?

239
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,980
I think you're deliberately

240
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,620
pretending to stay

241
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,810
to deceive us commoners!

242
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,410
Those rich people have all fled!

243
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:09,900
Let us out! We want to leave!

244
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,500
Did you bring many people today?

245
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:13,940
Not many.

246
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,980
But I just saw in the crowd

247
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,540
quite a few people
from the Crown Prince's Residence.

248
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,550
They're probably sent
by His Highness from the capital

249
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,400
and were blocked here
as soon as they entered the city.

250
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,940
Inform all guards and soldiers
of the Ning's Residence

251
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,580
to come to the city gate
immediately to maintain order.

252
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,420
With the guards just arrived,

253
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,900
it should be able to stop
the citizens for a short while

254
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,550
and prevent them
from rushing out of the city.

255
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,860
Can you single him out
directly from the crowd?

256
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,500
He looks unfamiliar,
not like a Yizhou local,

257
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,620
and wasn't seen among the infected.

258
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:50,000
Understood, Your Grace.

259
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,600
- Let us out!
- Out! Out!

260
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,820
What's going on?
Why are you arresting people?

261
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,140
I've seen you at Xiao Xu's residence.

262
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,350
That's impossible.
You couldn't have found out.

263
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:26,060
Murder! Murder! Murder!

264
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,260
Everyone, don't be incited
and deceived by this villain!

265
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:31,020
Leave quickly to avoid getting hurt.

266
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,500
The soldiers stationed outside said

267
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,600
anyone leaving the city
will be killed without mercy.

268
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,340
Didn't you want to leave?

269
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,060
I just gave him a hand,

270
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,940
see if he could leave the city alive.

271
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:52,620
Mr. Zhao stopped you
because he's afraid you'll seek death.

272
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,450
Do you think just because
you're many in number,

273
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,820
the soldiers outside
won't be able to stop you?

274
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,750
Are you sure you want to risk your lives

275
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,420
fighting against those

276
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,420
armed soldiers outside?

277
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,540
Then tell us, what should we do?

278
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,900
We'll die anyway.

279
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,500
What do you want us to do? Right?

280
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,780
Isn't that right? Everyone, isn't it?

281
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,300
Let us out!

282
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,940
Who said staying in the city
means death?

283
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,660
This plague is not incurable.

284
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,980
The physicians and doctors
are working on treatments.

285
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,300
If you fall ill after leaving,

286
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:28,460
which doctor
would dare to treat you then?

287
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:31,380
And which doctor

288
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,820
is more familiar with the cure
than the doctors in this city?

289
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:39,200
Furthermore, the court's aid
is already on the way.

290
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:42,500
If you follow
the officials' arrangements,

291
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,260
you won't get infected

292
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,660
and your life won't be at risk.

293
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:49,780
Who are you?

294
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:52,460
How can you guarantee that
the court's sending reinforcements

295
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,660
and not here to trap and kill us?

296
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,020
Exactly!

297
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,480
All the wealthy people
have already fled.

298
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,780
That's right!

299
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,460
How do we know if this is true?

300
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,300
Exactly!

301
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:07,690
This...

302
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:11,140
I am Princess Yuexi,
the sole daughter of Prince Ning,

303
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,860
and the Crown Princess.

304
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,300
As long as I remain in this city,

305
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,980
and as long as my father
and fiance are alive,

306
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,460
no one dares to abandon Yizhou.

307
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:25,100
- Princess Yuexi?
- The Crown Princess?

308
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,340
Is this real? Have you seen
Princess Yuexi before?
