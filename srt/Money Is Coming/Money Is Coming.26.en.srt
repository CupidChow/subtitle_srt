17
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,020
Xiao Xu,

18
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,440
who gave you the courage

19
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,480
to call the Crown Prince by name?

20
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:33,790
Crown Prince?
Father, have you forgotten?

21
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,000
I just said

22
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,150
to depose the Crown Prince
and appoint a new heir.

23
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:46,350
The Crown Prince isn't abolished

24
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,560
at your whim.

25
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,680
Do you still take me seriously?

26
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,880
Have you consulted
the court officials' opinions?

27
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,560
Court officials?

28
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,240
Ministers, since Father has asked,

29
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,160
please share your thoughts.

30
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,800
Should the Crown Prince be deposed?

31
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,820
Your Majesty, since the Crown Prince
returned to the nation,

32
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,940
he has been unremarkable
and accomplished nothing.

33
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,960
(Mr. Zhao)
And he is weak and ill,

34
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,620
unfit to inherit the throne.

35
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,680
(Mrs. Zhao)
Mr. Zhao is just a fifth-rank official.

36
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,120
His salary

37
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,150
is insufficient to cover
the lavish expenses in these records.

38
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,070
I don't know what you're talking about.

39
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,110
Your Majesty, the Crown Prince
was sent as a hostage to Liu Kingdom.

40
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,060
(Mr. Li)
He must've lost his ambition long ago.

41
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:44,480
Mr. Li has performed his role
as an envoy quite admirably.

42
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,760
There are dozens of letters

43
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,880
between him and foreign ministers.

44
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,060
He betrayed the nation
for personal gain,

45
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,940
(Mrs. Li)
and has indeed set us a good example.

46
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,440
Your Majesty, the Crown Prince
was raised in the Liu Kingdom.

47
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,920
He might have harbored ill intent.

48
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,240
And he has never
learned the art of governance.

49
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,480
If the Crown Prince were made King,

50
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,910
the century-old foundation of Great Li

51
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,480
(Mr. Du)
may be ruined under his reign.

52
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,360
Setting clear prices
for the sale of official titles,

53
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,390
(Mrs. Du)
bringing in a group of ignorant people

54
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,520
into the court.

55
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,690
In a small sense, it's greed.

56
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:17,160
In a larger sense, Mr. Du is trying

57
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,220
to undermine Great Li from within!

58
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,160
I don't know! I don't know!

59
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,720
You all...

60
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:29,130
I've raised a group of blind, useless,

61
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,920
and short-sighted fools!

62
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,990
Your Majesty, please
take care of your health.

63
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,120
Father, look. To please you,

64
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,560
I've made the entire court agree.

65
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,320
Do you have any more requests?

66
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,040
The Crown Prince
is unremarkable and unaccomplished?

67
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,760
Then who led the troops
to control the plague in Yizhou?

68
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,920
Who discovered the source of the plague

69
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,240
and who found the cure?

70
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,720
When you all shouted
to abandon the city,

71
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:17,320
who volunteered
to save the people from disaster?

72
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,240
He was a hostage in Liu Kingdom?

73
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,120
If not for the Crown Prince's sacrifice,

74
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,680
would you all still be alive today?

75
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,200
Power and wealth

76
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,480
have all clogged your minds.

77
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,800
Even if Xiao Xingheng
accomplished one or two things,

78
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,880
so what?

79
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,160
Other than leaning on Ning Chuxi
and the Ning family,

80
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,840
how does he compare to me?

81
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,800
Father, given the current situation,

82
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,320
you no longer have a say!

83
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,360
You...

84
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,520
Your Majesty,
please take care of yourself!

85
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:55,320
Even though we may not have
enough elite troops in the palace,

86
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,100
there are still thousands
of Imperial Guards.

87
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,720
Xiao Xu, where do you find
the audacity to say such things?

88
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,680
The Imperial Guards?

89
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,960
Xiao Xingheng, why don't you try it?

90
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,440
See who the Imperial Guards

91
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,080
take orders from now.

92
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,560
Xiao Xu, how dare you!

93
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,840
How could I raise

94
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,040
someone so ambitious,

95
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,040
traitorous and ungrateful like you?

96
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:29,340
Father, this is not ambition.

97
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,640
This is vision and determination.

98
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,240
Born into the royal family,

99
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,360
who wouldn't aspire
to the pinnacle of power?

100
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,120
I am simply more honest

101
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,160
than some hypocrites
who seek fame and fortune.

102
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,080
I merely lay my ambitions bare.

103
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,520
Xiao Xingheng, what is that look?

104
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,120
What do you have to be proud of?

105
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,920
I grew up by Father's side.

106
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,160
I was taught by the Grand Tutor,

107
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,080
and learned the strategies
of governance

108
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,900
and the principles
of serving the people.

109
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,380
And you? What were you doing?

110
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,400
You were bowing and scraping
in the Liu Kingdom,

111
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,260
living under others' noses,
barely surviving.

112
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,800
Your life was worse than a dog's!

113
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:16,320
Xiao Xingheng, as a hostage

114
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,520
and a nominal Crown Prince,

115
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,900
you've no right to compete with me.

116
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,720
His magnanimity and demeanor!

117
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,000
His integrity and righteousness,

118
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,160
and his courage to save Yizhou
during the plague.

119
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,760
He is far more worthy
to be the ruler of Great Li than you.

120
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,860
Father, angering me now

121
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,040
is not a wise move.

122
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,400
The capital city, inside and out,
is now filled with my men,

123
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,840
waiting for my command.

124
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,170
Father,

125
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,040
would you prefer I take the throne
without bloodshed

126
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,720
or have rivers of blood flow
in this fight for power?

127
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,800
Scoundrel!

128
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,480
Since you are so benevolent,

129
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,040
you surely don't want
to implicate the lives of soldiers

130
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,440
and countless palace attendants

131
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,690
and see the people suffer, do you?

132
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:14,830
Is that so?

133
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:18,400
Xiao Xu, then go ahead and try.

134
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,320
After you give the order,

135
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,760
will you even live long enough

136
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,080
to see yourself inherit the throne?

137
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,000
Xiao Xingheng, I know
you're not afraid of death.

138
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,040
But what about Ning Chuxi?

139
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,960
Is she afraid of death?

140
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:40,680
You care about her so much.

141
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,390
Why don't you hide her better?

142
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:48,440
When she dies, do you think

143
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:49,960
she will hate you?

144
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,970
Will she hate you for dragging her

145
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,720
into this conflict in the name of love?

146
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,560
Are you getting anxious now?

147
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,880
Feeling heartache?

148
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,930
How about this,

149
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:14,440
I'll make a deal with you.

150
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,880
If you can convince Father

151
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,570
to issue an edict
to abdicate the throne to me,

152
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,120
I guarantee

153
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,720
Ning Chuxi will be
returned to you unharmed

154
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:30,080
so you two can stay together.
How about that?

155
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,000
Your Majesty.

156
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,720
Your Highness, Her Grace suddenly

157
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,030
set up a banquet in the Wei Garden

158
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:58,840
and invited the officials' families
to enjoy the garden's scenery.

159
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,600
Since you left early this morning,

160
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,120
she didn't consult you beforehand.

161
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,320
She borrowed it on her own
and sent me to inform you.

162
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:15,440
No matter. My garden is hers as well.

163
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,000
She can use it whenever

164
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,880
and however she pleases.

165
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,960
Yes.

166
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,080
Moreover,

167
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:27,070
Her Grace also asked me
to relay a message to you all.

168
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,880
Today...

169
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,720
If Xiao Xingheng doesn't
show up unharmed

170
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,760
to pick me up at the Wei Garden,

171
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,960
then everyone in the garden

172
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,720
will die with me

173
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,510
as a sacrifice for Xiao Xingheng.

174
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,720
This...

175
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,640
What?

176
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,720
How could Her Grace do this?

177
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,120
- This is...
- Exactly.

178
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,960
This...

179
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,320
Report!

180
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,880
Prince Ning is leading
fifty thousand soldiers

181
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,760
toward the palace.

182
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,800
What did you say? Say it again!

183
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,000
Prince Ning is leading soldiers
toward the palace.

184
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,560
Get out!

185
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,280
Impossible.

186
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,200
This is absolutely impossible!

187
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,800
Aren't Prince Ning's troops still
stationed outside the border?

188
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,120
How could they return so quickly?

189
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,960
Throw this treacherous son
into the dungeon,

190
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,240
and await further punishment!

191
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,040
Dismiss the court!

192
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,000
What should we do now?

193
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,560
You'd better think carefully.

194
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:31,000
Your mothers, wives, and daughters

195
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,720
are all in Wei Garden,

196
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,440
waiting for you to bring them back.

197
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,560
Don't force us to give in.

198
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,480
Heaven's justice is clear.

199
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,520
The truth will one day be revealed.

200
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,480
I will die to uphold my resolve!

201
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,160
This...

202
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,800
Still breathing.

203
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,280
Since he harbors such determination,

204
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,440
I will help him fulfill it.

205
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,720
No need for the historian
to record his death.

206
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:28,080
Just write that he was an unrepentant
accomplice of the rebels,

207
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,640
and died today in Qianyuan Hall.

208
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,840
Simply state his execution
as the reason.

209
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,320
The Crown Prince now
acts decisively and ruthlessly.

210
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,360
He's no longer the gentle

211
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,120
and mild prince he once was.

212
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,120
I know that deep down,
you have always resented me,

213
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:03,160
though you've never
expressed it in words.

214
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,200
Since Mother passed away,

215
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,640
I no longer understand what hatred is.

216
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:17,440
I have drafted the edict
to pass the throne to you.

217
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,480
But I hope that you

218
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,120
keep Xu's life.

219
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,800
He has committed treason!

220
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:35,000
But he is your brother after all.

221
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,360
Father, you should rest well.

222
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:01,120
The Third Prince Xiao Xu
is hereby stripped of his princely title,

223
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,200
demoted to commoner status
and exiled to Jizhou,

224
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,440
prohibited from returning
to the capital for life.

225
