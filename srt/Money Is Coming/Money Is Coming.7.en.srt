The envoys shall meet the Emperor!

18
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,040
(What? You haven't seen a woman before?)

19
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:35,550
This lamp is really nice.

20
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,720
(How could I forget about him?)

21
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:41,830
(Xiao Han, the Fifth Prince.)

22
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,860
(Xiao Han, Fifth Prince)
(I remember in the later story,)

23
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,730
(Xiao Han was also very cunning,)

24
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,880
(and was always opposing Xiao Xu.)

25
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,240
(I wonder how many evil deeds)

26
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,230
(he has done secretly)

27
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,920
(and whether Xiao Xingheng)

28
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,320
(knows his true colors.)

29
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,800
The Crown Prince has arrived!

30
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,880
Greetings, Father.

31
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,890
You've really grown capable.

32
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,280
Of course,
your daughter is beautiful.

33
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,040
Don't end up in trouble

34
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,770
and bring trouble to me.

35
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,270
No way, I'll never get into trouble.

36
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,120
Girls can't be kept home
once they're grown.

37
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,340
But my daughter

38
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,000
deserves the best man in the world.

39
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,720
If things go wrong, no worries.

40
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,200
Your father will back you up.

41
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,170
You just need to pick the man you like.

42
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,460
Old man, enough talking.
It's all in this drink.

43
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,350
All you know is how to chatter.

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,040
The feast begins!

45
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,640
I brought Princess Jielan here

46
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,280
to wish Your Majesty a happy birthday.

47
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,000
Thank you for coming specially.

48
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:13,400
Convey my regards to your king.

49
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:14,540
This time coming here,

50
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:17,440
His Majesty specifically asked me
to bring Princess Jielan,

51
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,480
hoping to form
a lasting alliance with Great Li.

52
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,360
May I ask which royal member

53
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,600
he has in mind for this match?

54
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,160
This should be decided by you.

55
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,640
But your Crown Prince
has deep ties with our nation.

56
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,840
(Deep ties?)

57
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:43,740
(I remember the book mentioned)

58
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,700
(the Crown Prince was
a hostage prince in the Liu Kingdom.)

59
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:48,010
(But it's only briefly mentioned.)

60
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,110
(Could there be some hidden story?)

61
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,600
I don't want to marry that sickly man.

62
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,270
In the Liu Kingdom, that sickly man

63
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,150
was so timid and annoying.

64
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:59,720
And now, he's often bedridden.

65
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:02,240
I don't want to become a widow
right after marrying.

66
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,980
Please forgive her, Your Majesty.
Princess Jielan is young and naive.

67
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,040
What she said earlier
was without malice.

68
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,330
Please don't take offense, Your Majesty.

69
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,000
Princess Jielan,
who do you have in mind?

70
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,480
Of course, someone who is
not only healthy and handsome,

71
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,520
but also versed in both
literature and martial arts.

72
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,640
And most importantly, he must be
your favorite prince.

73
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,640
(Now she's picking.)

74
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,240
Princess Jielan really
thinks highly of herself.

75
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,270
She hasn't even considered
if any prince would marry her.

76
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,640
Am I wrong?

77
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,310
Back in the Liu Kingdom,
that Crown Prince

78
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:42,680
was scolded by my siblings
and didn't dare talk back.

79
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,160
Who would want to marry
someone like that?

80
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,760
Shut up!

81
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,720
I just acted improperly.

82
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,360
But there are some words I must say.

83
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,720
I beg for your forgiveness.

84
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,760
It's fine. I permit you to speak freely.

85
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,270
Princess Jielan, I just observed
your appearance up close.

86
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,120
In terms of looks, you're just average.

87
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,840
In terms of virtue,
you speak carelessly and hurt others.

88
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,070
Your words and actions are vile.

89
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,500
It clearly shows a lack of character.

90
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:24,240
In terms of family background,
while you are a princess,

91
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,650
you are not the legitimate daughter.

92
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,760
And several years ago,
the Liu Kingdom already

93
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,360
signed a surrender treaty
with our nation.

94
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,920
You are just an illegitimate princess
from a defeated country.

95
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,690
Who gave you the courage

96
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,800
to criticize and pick on
our Crown Prince?

97
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,560
Take a look in the mirror.
Are you worthy of that?

98
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,680
You...

99
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,280
Well said.

100
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,720
You said I'm not worthy?

101
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,480
His Majesty hasn't said anything.

102
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,000
How dare you, a mere woman,
criticize me?

103
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,240
Are you even worthy?

104
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,760
You should be grateful
that my father governs

105
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,200
the northern frontiers
and not the western regions.

106
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,520
Otherwise, you wouldn't even
have the chance to question me.

107
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,520
Princess Jielan says
Princess Yuexi is unworthy.

108
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:20,320
I wonder if I'm worthy.

109
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,390
If not for His Majesty's kindness,

110
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,920
worrying that war
would displace the people,

111
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,080
I'd have led troops

112
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,360
to occupy your imperial city.

113
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,400
At that time, Princess,

114
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,600
you wouldn't be here questioning
whether Princess Yuexi is worthy.

115
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,120
Thanks.

116
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,410
Well done.

117
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:06,600
The men in my country
are all outstanding, they'll find wives.

118
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:10,400
I appreciate your king's
good intentions.

119
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,840
But the alliance marriage
is now dismissed.

120
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,440
Yes.

121
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,960
I've come to offer birthday wishes
to Your Majesty.

122
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,760
Wish you longevity.

123
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,120
Rise.

124
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,220
Though the timing
might be inappropriate,

125
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,360
I must still make it clear.

126
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,120
My father specifically instructed me

127
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,220
that if Your Majesty agrees,

128
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,030
he hopes our prince
may find a good match in Great Li.

129
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,760
Here comes another.

130
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,760
His Majesty's sons are being stolen away.

131
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,840
Exactly.

132
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,880
Do you have someone in mind?

133
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,240
I've heard Princess Yuexi
is virtuous and refined.

134
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,900
I hope Your Majesty and Prince Ning
will grant this favor.

135
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,320
What are you talking about?

136
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,410
Who gave you the courage?

137
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:08,520
Are you courting death?

138
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,730
Prince Ning, calm down.

139
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:12,290
It's not that serious, calm down.

140
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:15,460
- Interesting, truly interesting.
- Calm down, Prince Ning.

141
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,390
Don't stop me!

142
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:18,870
Prince Ning.

143
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,960
This is outrageous!

144
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,160
Get over here!

145
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,420
- What, can't bear to part with her?
- Brat, you...

146
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:28,760
Let alone the tense relations
between Beiqiong and Great Li,

147
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,640
if war breaks out,

148
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,960
every royal woman married off
will become a hostage.

149
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,450
- Take her for example,
- Calm down, Prince Ning.

150
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,600
- the only daughter of Prince Ning
- What are you thinking about?

151
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,080
and the glory of the Ning's troops.

152
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,960
Would His Majesty marry her off?

153
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,200
Daring to covet my daughter?

154
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,920
Enough, enough, enough.

155
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,320
This brat.

156
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,880
Princess Yuexi
is the pearl of our nation.

157
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,280
She should be cherished and kept safe.

158
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,820
How could we let her leave?

159
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,440
You two are not right for each other.

160
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:07,060
But, if you fancy another noble lady,

161
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,470
I would be pleased to see it happen.

162
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,640
I... Just you wait!

163
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,040
Thank you, Your Majesty.

164
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,960
This is too infuriating.

165
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,840
If you wish to win over Prince Ning,

166
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,680
I can help you.

167
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:37,440
No need. I want her
to genuinely align with me.

168
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,440
I shouldn't have attended this event.

169
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,840
Your Grace.

170
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,800
Pardon me, Your Grace,

171
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,320
for being abrupt.

172
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,160
It's just that my master
invites you for a private conversation.

173
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,680
Who is your master?

174
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,840
Mr. Bai.

175
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,600
