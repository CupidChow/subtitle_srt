=Episode 12=

17
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:33,960
You're awake.

18
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,440
Do last night's words still count?

19
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,360
You're not afraid of me anymore?

20
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,680
Why should I be afraid of you?

21
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,360
Last time in the dungeon,
you pushed me away.

22
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,640
Wasn't it because
you were scared of me then?

23
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,000
Oh please.

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,320
I knew exactly what kind of person
you were when we first met.

25
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,660
Why would I be scared of you?

26
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,640
Then why did you push me away

27
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,240
and leave without saying a word?

28
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,800
Come on, Boss, get it straight.

29
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,830
I'm just a girl
who hasn't seen much bloodshed.

30
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,920
Any woman who sees someone

31
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,480
die right in front of her

32
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,120
would react the same way, okay?

33
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,680
Boss?

34
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,960
That's not important.

35
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,800
What matters is,

36
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,200
it grossed me out so much
I couldn't eat meat for three days.

37
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,400
Can we make a deal?

38
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,360
Next time you kill people in front of me,

39
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,570
can you keep the wounds smaller

40
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:42,680
and the scene less bloodly?

41
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,920
Just take care of me, okay?

42
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,950
Alright, whatever you say.

43
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:53,920
But

44
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,520
I'm a bit curious.

45
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,400
Did you really skin that prisoner

46
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,240
in the dungeon?

47
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,760
He was once under my command.

48
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:13,240
But during a mission, I discovered

49
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,240
that he had assaulted many young girls,

50
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,560
so I personally broke both his legs

51
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,860
and his arms as well.

52
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,040
I see.

53
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,000
Though cruel,

54
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,640
he deserved it.

55
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,000
You've asked me so many questions.

56
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,640
Now let me ask you one.

57
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,680
Do you really like Helou Che?

58
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,830
It's only been a few meetings.
I can't say I like him.

59
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:49,080
But Helou Che is a pretty good person.

60
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,200
Isn't it because of your status

61
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,800
that you didn't go with him to Beiqiong?

62
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,080
If I say yes, what will you do?

63
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,960
Why would I give up being a princess

64
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,880
and go endure hardships in Beiqiong?

65
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,600
Though they have vast grasslands
where I can ride horses,

66
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,960
it can't compare to the wealth
and prosperity I have now.

67
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,420
Someone's jealous.

68
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:32,300
Like a green-eyed monster.

69
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,240
I bought this just for you.

70
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,990
Don't be mad.

71
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,280
First it was sugar people,
now a grasshopper.

72
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,510
You're really treating me like a kid.

73
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,880
Thanks, I'll take it.

74
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,550
Does Helou Che get one too?

75
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,920
Why are you even comparing now?

76
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,760
No, no, only you get one.

77
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,800
I'll lie down and sleep too.

78
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,120
By the way,

79
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,280
do you like horse riding?

80
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:38,730
Can you ride a horse?

81
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,120
I can, but not very well.

82
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:44,180
Why do you ask?

83
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,360
What a pity.

84
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,760
I was thinking of teaching you

85
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,240
at the royal hunting event.

86
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,380
You'd look so cute as a beginner.

87
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,120
Wait a minute.

88
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,360
The royal hunt?

89
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,880
(Apart from the lovey-dovey moments
of the leads,)

90
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,980
(it also mentioned
the Crown Prince's assassination.)

91
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,000
(And soon after the hunting event,)

92
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,850
(the Crown Prince passed away
due to illness.)

93
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,680
What should I do?

94
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,880
In such a Marry Sue fiction,

95
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,120
the author clearly focuses on

96
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,000
the love stories
of the leads during the hunt.

97
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,560
The Crown Prince's assassination
is just brushed over.

98
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,200
What does the book say again?

99
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,800
Why is this girl acting so strangely lately?

100
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,520
After the hunt, the Crown Prince died.

101
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,200
Then the male lead came to the scene.

102
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,980
I can't just tell him, "Hey,

103
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,690
you're about to die soon,

104
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,390
so be more cautious!"

105
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:54,760
Who? Who's about to die?

106
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,010
Tell me clearly!

107
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:04,130
Xiao Xingheng invited me
to join the hunting event.

108
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:05,850
I can't do it.

109
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,410
I'm going to disgrace our Ning family.

110
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,760
I see.

111
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:18,070
The blood in your veins is mine,

112
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,520
and hunting is second nature to us.

113
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,010
What are you afraid of?

114
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,880
Don't be a coward, just go!

115
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,730
- Go, go on.
- Father, I...

116
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,240
I'll go.

117
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:44,260
Miss, all the other young masters
and ladies have gone out.

118
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,420
Why don't you go ride your horse

119
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,780
and get familiar with the area?

120
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:48,570
Alright.

121
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,940
By the way, when the hunt begins,

122
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,930
I'll be going in with the Crown Prince.

123
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,660
If I don't return within two hours,

124
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,620
no matter the reason,

125
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,740
tell my father you've received
a distress signal

126
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,010
and have him find me in the forest.

127
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,220
Miss, is something going to happen?

128
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,420
Not necessarily.

129
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,460
That's just a precaution.

130
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:15,340
Make sure my father
brings enough people.

131
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,300
I'll remember.

132
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,540
Be careful, Miss.

133
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:29,260
Greetings, Your Grace.

134
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,030
Yudai, you look great today.

135
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:33,390
Thank you, Your Highness.

136
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,020
The entrance of Princess Yuexi

137
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,700
will undoubtedly capture
the souls of countless young men.

138
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,570
She was previously devoted
to my third brother,

139
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,980
and now she uses this trick

140
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,340
to seduce other men.

141
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,020
Truly a fool.

142
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,220
(She used to claim she admired me.)

143
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,780
(But now her attitude
has completely changed.)

144
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,500
(She's parading around so shamelessly)

145
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,540
(and flirtatiously.)

146
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,820
(What does she take me for?)

147
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,810
Your Grace, watch out!

148
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,300
Ning Chuxi, are you insane?

149
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,420
You're the insane one!

150
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,400
Do you know the punishment
for whipping a royal member?

151
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,860
And do you know the punishment
for shooting at a princess?

152
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,660
Your Grace, you're mistaken.

153
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,380
His Highness merely slipped.

154
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,660
It was unintentional.

155
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,060
Moreover, you're completely unharmed.

156
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,540
But your whipping of His Highness

157
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,780
was clearly intentional.

158
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,620
My path wasn't even near the woods.

159
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,940
If His Highness managed
to "accidentally" shoot me from there,

160
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,380
then all his archery training was in vain.

161
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,780
If His Highness can slip,

162
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,420
then why can't I slip

163
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,060
and whip him?

164
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,220
You're unharmed,

165
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,660
but I'm injured in the arm.

166
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,250
Do you really think
Father won't hold you accountable?

167
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,220
What? My hair isn't injured?

168
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,980
You're being completely unreasonable.

169
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,780
You really take yourself seriously.

170
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,700
Didn't she see even
the Fourth Princess knows better now?

171
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,220
And yet she keeps putting on an act.

172
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,180
This is between me and His Highness.

173
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,940
Who do you think you are?

174
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:09,930
Exactly.

175
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,060
Miss Lin hasn't even married in yet,

176
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,300
and is already acting
like His Highness's wife,

177
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,980
arguing with Princess Yuexi.

178
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,580
If the Third Prince wants an explanation,

179
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,020
he should do it himself.

180
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:22,760
I don't think you're qualified yet.

181
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,220
Ning Chuxi, you're going too far!

182
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,940
If you think I've gone too far,

183
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,340
perhaps I should call my father,

184
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:38,430
and we can both explain everything
to His Majesty together.

185
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,820
If the young ones can't settle things,

186
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,700
they turn to their elders.

187
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,860
Xu.

188
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:55,700
Your Highness.

189
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,340
What happened?

190
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,440
Why you're injured?

191
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:09,020
Quickly, get a physician to bandage it.

192
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,180
There seems to be some

193
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,180
misunderstanding
between Her Grace and you.

194
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,450
(Don't think I didn't notice)

195
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,580
(you've been standing there
watching this whole time.)

196
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,220
There is a slight misunderstanding.

197
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,700
His Highness accidentally injured me,

198
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,020
and I accidentally injured him.

199
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,780
Since it was an accident,

200
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,980
let's not dwell on it.

201
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,580
Xu,

202
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,220
quickly find a royal physician.

203
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,620
If you let this injury sit too long,

204
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,740
it might actually heal.

205
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,780
I'll escort Her Grace back to camp.

206
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,940
We're heading the same way.

207
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,140
Third Prince, how's your injury?

208
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,600
Is it starting to heal?

209
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,540
That whip really hit the spot.

210
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,670
If I weren't afraid of being blamed,

211
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,380
I'd have whipped him a few more times.

212
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,800
There will be more opportunities.

213
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,520
That golden crown was expensive.
I forgot to make him compensate me.

214
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,260
I'll compensate you.

215
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:27,990
I thought you'd blame me
for being impulsive.

216
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,300
Remember,

217
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,420
if something like this happens again,

218
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,700
just fight back.

219
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,100
If you can't win, come to me.

220
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,900
Don't worry about the consequences.

221
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,180
Your father can protect you,

222
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,020
and I will also back you up.

223
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,220
Boss, you're even cooler now.

224
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:53,980
Let's go.

225
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,420
Your Majesty, bad news!

226
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,580
Speak.

227
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,580
Your Majesty, the Third Prince
and Princess Yuexi got into a fight.

228
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,330
The Third Prince shot an arrow
at Princess Yuexi,

229
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,330
but it missed.

230
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:19,470
Then Princess Yuexi
whipped the Third Prince.

231
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:20,960
And then the Crown Prince...

232
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,850
Enough.

233
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,380
Leave.

234
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,340
Yes.

235
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,020
(A wise goose never lays a tame egg.)

236
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,620
(I didn't expect my daughter
to be so brave.)

237
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,620
(Not bad, not bad.)

238
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,260
(Wait.)

239
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,300
My unruly daughter
has injured the Third Prince.

240
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,420
I beg Your Majesty for forgiveness.

241
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:45,500
You're overthinking this.

242
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:49,500
These are just small quarrels
among children.

243
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,140
There's no crime in that.

244
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,250
Thank you, Your Majesty,
for your understanding.

245
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:56,900
No need for formalities.

246
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:58,910
Sit down.

247
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,340
(Old fox, how will you
handle this punishment?)

248
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:13,720
(Your daughter whipped my son,)

249
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,340
(and my son hasn't even retaliated yet.)

250
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,460
Why do you seem so nervous today?

251
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:42,620
To be honest,

252
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,800
I've had a bad feeling
since this morning.

253
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,060
Is this why you told me to be prepared?

254
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:54,620
What's wrong?

255
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,700
Looks like your premonition was spot on.

256
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,820
Although I took precautions
as you suggested,

257
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,260
I didn't expect they put in so much effort.

258
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,730
There are more people than I imagined.

259
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,620
What do we do now?

260
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,140
It's fine.

261
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,220
I'll have Huailiu escort you back.

262
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,740
Their target is me.

263
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,580
They're not very interested
in stopping you.

264
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,380
Are you out of your mind?

265
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:23,980
They already outnumber us,

266
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,980
and you want to send me away?

267
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,140
Don't worry.

268
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,420
You can go for reinforcements.

269
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,240
It's not safe here.

270
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,420
I know you mean well,

271
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,830
but this is not the time
to be impulsive.

272
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:47,060
There's only the two of us.

273
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,020
Staying together
is our best chance for safety.

274
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,660
I gave you a chance.

275
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,200
(From now on, no matter life or death,)

276
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,250
(you can't leave me again.)

277
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,300
Come on, Boss.

278
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:09,180
At such a tense moment,

279
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,000
what are you smiling about?

280
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,150
Huailiu, protect Her Grace!

281
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,780
Xiao Xingheng!

282
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,100
Chuxi! Chuxi!
