=Episode 11=

17
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,760
But I truly admire you.

18
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,840
(Helou Che could express his love
for her so directly

19
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,600
(and try his best to fight for it.)

20
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,960
(But I can only wear a mask,)

21
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,520
(trying to look like a normal person)

22
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,720
(and carefully covering up the darkness.)

23
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,920
(Ultimately, I was still despised.)

24
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,240
What a handsome young man!

25
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,110
Come play with me.

26
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,520
You still dare to struggle?

27
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:54,290
Let go of me.

28
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,480
Let go.

29
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,920
Let go.

30
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,230
Let go.

31
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,680
What? Master won't eat
and you aren't eating either?

32
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,400
Why are you here?

33
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,620
If I don't come,

34
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,960
you would starve yourselves.

35
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,770
Master intentionally
let that spy speak out

36
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,480
so Her Grace could see his true self.

37
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,760
Yes.

38
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,440
Maybe he's gambling

39
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,100
that Her Grace always knew

40
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,440
and that she doesn't mind.

41
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,640
But it seems he lost the gamble.

42
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,200
He has never truly been

43
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,520
this refined and gentle.

44
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,840
The reason he became this way

45
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:48,120
was merely to conform
to societal expectations.

46
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,760
He was once abused by others

47
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,480
and he has also hurt others.

48
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,320
He was assassinated

49
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,640
and also killed others.

50
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,440
Do you regret it?

51
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,240
Do you regret staying in
the Crown Prince's residence

52
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,440
and following Xiao Xingheng?

53
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,160
I'm a grown man.

54
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,640
Since that's the path I chose,

55
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,400
I must walk it firmly and unwaveringly.

56
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:37,880
Let's go.

57
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,150
Have something to eat.

58
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,800
(In all my past and present lifetimes,)

59
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,250
(it's the first time I've seen
someone die in front of me,)

60
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,510
(and with head and body separated)

61
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,350
(in a gruesome and bloody manner.)

62
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:04,580
(Although Xiao Xingheng killed him)

63
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,730
(to save me,)

64
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,790
(he didn't have to)

65
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,880
(do that right in front of me, right?)

66
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:18,580
(Dedication and Wisdom)

67
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,550
Miss, Huailiu just came by and said

68
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,000
His Highness is busy today

69
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,360
and asked you not to go over.

70
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,550
(This is the first time Xiao Xingheng
has broken an appointment.)

71
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,280
(Wait,)

72
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,520
(is he mad at me)

73
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,800
(because I ran off last time?)

74
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:41,030
(That's so petty.)

75
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,930
(I'll appease him next time we meet.)

76
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,680
Wait, there's one more thing.

77
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,260
(Invitation)
Ta da.

78
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,270
This was sent over by Mr. Helou.

79
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:52,890
Here.

80
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,060
What is it?

81
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,760
An exclusive invitation to Your Grace

82
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:59,240
(Helou Che)
for a tour in the capital.

83
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,370
My pleasant weekend is gone.

84
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,980
(Jiqing Lane)

85
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,200
The first time I met you
was on this street.

86
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,320
I didn't know your identity.

87
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,480
But even then, I thought,

88
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:24,930
this woman has good judgment.

89
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:26,990
She could tell at a glance
that I was wrongly accused.

90
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,600
You looked so pitiful back then.

91
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,200
It was hard not to believe you.

92
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:36,960
You might not believe this,

93
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,320
but

94
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:45,360
the first time I saw you,
I already adored you.

95
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,800
I just didn't know your name back then,

96
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,360
nor your identity.

97
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,340
What about you?

98
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,080
What did you feel
the first time you saw me?

99
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,040
The first time I saw you...

100
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,080
Let go, I didn't do it.

101
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:12,990
Everyone, come quickly.

102
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,000
I thought at the time,

103
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,710
such a delicate young man

104
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,960
should be running free on the grassland.

105
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,760
Being trapped in the capital
and wrongly accused

106
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,320
is really unfair to you.

107
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,080
I'm not delicate.

108
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,240
The men from Beiqiong

109
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,210
are all proud and solitary.

110
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,850
Grasshoppers, grasshoppers!

111
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,530
Miss, want to buy a grasshopper?

112
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,920
I'll take this one.

113
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,000
Alright.

114
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,880
Here you go.

115
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,560
(Her Grace is so kind to buy me a gift.)

116
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,360
I didn't expect you
to still have a childlike heart,

117
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,200
and like such little trinkets.

118
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,680
Your Grace.

119
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,480
If we are not meant to be,

120
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,640
this may be the last time we meet.

121
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,880
Yes, Great Lii and Beiqiong
are thousands of miles apart.

122
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,920
I've always wanted to ask you.

123
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,800
If you are not Princess Yuexi,

124
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,350
not the sole daughter of Prince Ning,

125
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,840
and your emperor
arranged a marriage for you,

126
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,600
would you choose to marry me?

127
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,940
Would you go back to Beiqiong with me?

128
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,000
No.

129
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,080
Why?

130
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,000
I don't love you.

131
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,200
I am just a passing scenery for you.

132
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,600
You may feel sad now

133
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,120
that you can't stay with me,

134
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,360
but when you meet the right one,

135
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,600
you will think

136
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,260
you made a good choice
choosing not to stay.

137
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,080
Otherwise, how would you see
the more beautiful scenery to come?

138
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,560
All of this

139
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,960
is the best arrangement.

140
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,080
(No, there will never be another girl)

141
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,800
(who amazes my life like you.)

142
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,240
To have your favor is my fortune.

143
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,360
I'll use tea instead of wine

144
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,600
to wish you

145
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,200
a bright future and good health.

146
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,480
Open it when you get back.

147
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,280
Take care of yourself after we part.

148
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:20,780
(Dedication and Wisdom)

149
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,560
Although I've heard about the spy

150
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,440
from Xiao Xingheng,

151
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,420
I do owe this favor

152
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,740
from Helou Che.

153
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,850
Miss, Huailiu's been waiting for you
at the back gate for a long time.

154
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:45,160
Didn't he say I don't need to go?

155
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:46,550
Why is he here to pick me up today?

156
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,440
I'm not sure either.

157
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,160
Huailiu only said it was
instructed by His Highness.

158
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,280
Oh, he also mentioned

159
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,200
His Highness is not in good condition.

160
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,400
What do you mean?

161
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,930
What's wrong with you?

162
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,900
You're here.

163
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,720
How many days have you stayed up?

164
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,960
You went out alone with Helou Che?

165
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,920
How did you know?

166
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,240
You had someone follow me?

167
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,720
Why did you have someone follow me?

168
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,760
Could it be you're jealous?

169
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,960
What did he say to you?

170
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:19,960
He asked if I wanted to go back
to Beiqiong with him.

171
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,240
You want to elope with him?

172
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,400
Did you agree?

173
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,760
I forbid it.

174
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,320
Isn't it good to stay by my side?

175
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,080
Can't you always stay with me?

176
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:47,710
Don't go, okay?

177
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,520
(Looks like he's having an episode.)

178
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,560
(But this fragile appearance)

179
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,240
(is oddly appealing.)

180
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,440
Alright.

181
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,680
I will always stay by your side

182
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,440
until I can no longer continue, okay?

183
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,000
Okay.

184
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,280
(This is Xiao Xingheng.)

185
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,240
(He is ruthlessness)
