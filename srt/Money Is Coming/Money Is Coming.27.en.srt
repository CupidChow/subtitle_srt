=Episode 27=

17
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,330
Today, Xiao Xu will be exiled to Jizhou

18
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,350
and not to return
to the capital for life.

19
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,240
If I were you,

20
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,780
I would leave this palace forever.

21
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,460
Xu, I'm coming for you.

22
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,080
I will stay with you

23
00:01:58,570 --> 00:01:59,960
and won't let you be alone.

24
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:18,820
Last night, I had a dream.

25
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,080
A dream?

26
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,240
I dreamed that
I was engaged to Ning Chuxi.

27
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,160
Side by side,
our brows in harmony unite.

28
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,790
I hold your hand, through life we'll go.

29
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,200
Ning Chuxi was still
madly in love with me.

30
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,830
And using Prince Ning's power,

31
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,000
I absorbed part of

32
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,610
the northern frontier's forces
in just three years.

33
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,400
Three years later,

34
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,760
under my arrangements,

35
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,520
Xiao Xingheng died shortly

36
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,400
- The military seal is yours.
- after the autumn hunt.

37
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,120
Take good care of Chuxi.

38
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,480
With Prince Ning's support,

39
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,480
I successfully ascended
to the position of Crown Prince.

40
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,000
Later,

41
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:09,350
to marry

42
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,180
my beloved woman,

43
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,320
and to rid myself the Ning family
that was no longer of use,

44
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,680
yet constantly suppressed me,

45
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,800
I allowed you to accuse
Ning Chuxi of an affair,

46
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,310
and let her be poisoned to death.

47
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,720
Indeed,

48
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,200
as long as it's the wine sent by Xu,

49
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,920
you'll never doubt it.

50
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,560
Aunt, save me!

51
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,720
Chuxi,

52
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,600
why did you do this?

53
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,640
Why would you poison yourself?

54
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,920
If only you had listened to me,

55
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,960
you'd be the Empress eventually.

56
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,440
Why were you so impatient

57
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,360
to do such a foolish thing?

58
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,320
But today,

59
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,920
even if you die here,

60
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,280
no one will see it.

61
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,600
After Ning Chuxi's death,

62
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,640
Prince Ning rebelled.

63
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,200
I executed Prince Ning
under the charge of treason.

64
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,480
Afterwards,

65
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,240
I eliminated Xiao Han,
who opposed me everywhere,

66
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,120
and finally ascended to the throne!

67
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,880
Long live the Emperor!

68
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:52,160
I crowned my beloved woman
as Empress.

69
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,800
Sounds crazy, doesn't it?

70
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,000
It was so real.

71
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,760
So real that it feels like
this is my life.

72
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:06,300
This should have been my life!

73
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,760
But

74
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,000
why did it turn out like this?

75
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,040
Why?

76
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,000
Why?

77
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,360
Why?

78
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,760
Why?

79
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Why?

80
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,240
Why?

81
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,600
Get out!

82
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,680
I hold your hand, through life we'll go.

83
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,720
Long live the Emperor!

84
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,480
(This should all have been mine.)

85
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,520
(How did it come to this?)

86
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,520
Is it you?

87
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,410
Now I know why.

88
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,110
If it weren't for your meddling,

89
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,160
and if you hadn't bewitched me,

90
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:10,660
Ning Chuxi
would still have married me.

91
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:12,640
Then everything in the dream

92
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,160
would have been real.

93
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,440
It's your fault, all your fault!

94
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,240
It's my fault.

95
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,760
It's my fault.

96
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,640
Did you ever truly love me?

97
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,240
Perhaps I did.

98
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,640

Here, eat more crab sticks.

116
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,360
It's delicious.

117
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,800
Slow down.

118
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,480
I know. I'm not a child.

119
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,480
Eat.

120
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,560
- Have some more.
- You too.

121
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,560
Shall I peel some shrimp for you?

122
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,400
Sure.

123
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,520
My Chuxi has finally
found a good match.

124
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,280
Mother, stop worrying so much.

125
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,720
Children have their own blessings.

126
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,360
Are you satisfied with your son-in-law?

127
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,960
My son-in-law
is both scholarly and chivalrous.

128
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,360
Chuxi is fortunate enough

129
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,480
to marry him.

130
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,520
Yes.

131
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:42,120
Chuxi, treasure this destined bond well.

132
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,200
Yes.

133
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,760
Let's toast to this.

134
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,720
- Come on.
- Come on.

135
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,200
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

136
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,040
Come on.

137
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,080
Cheers.

138
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,720
What a perfect match.

139
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,150
- Have some dishes.
- Have the dishes.

140
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,680
Try this one.

141
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,640
Try this.

142
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,720
Delicious.

143
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,800
Your Highness, you must be
busy with court affairs.

144
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,000
How do you have the leisure

145
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,320
to handle such trivial matters?

146
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,010
Anything concerning Chuxi

147
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:31,240
is never trivial to me.

148
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,520
I must take care of it personally.

149
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,480
I know.

150
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,240
Oh, dear.

151
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:41,320
Our Ning family
can't even afford a new plate

152
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,520
for sauces.

153
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,040
The Crown Prince has to

154
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,280
pick cilantro for my daughter personally.

155
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,880
Alright, you're just reluctant
to part with your daughter.

156
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,640
Mother, you don't know

157
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,760
how I lived these three years
without Chuxi.

158
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,740
Let's go.

159
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,080
How did you get through it?

160
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,920
By draining myself internally.

161
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,440
You...

162
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,600
So loving.

163
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,040
Where are you going?

164
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,040
Don't go.

165
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,880
Dig in.

166
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,440
- Let's drink.
- Sit and eat.

167
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,880
- Come on.
- Alright.

168
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,820
I'll toast you.

169
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,000
Cheers.

170
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,360
Why does tonight feel a bit unreal?

171
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,320
Have you drunk too much?

172
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,200
I'm not drunk.

173
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,160
After all, the one I'm holding is real.

174
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:35,960
Xiao Xingheng.

175
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,030
Yes?

176
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,280
Look, what's in the sky?

177
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,800
Stars.

178
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,840
Stars shine so that everyone

179
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,040
can find their own star.

180
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,000
And what's on the ground?

181
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,360
You.

182
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,160
I have you too.

183
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,720
Xiao Xingheng,

184
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,640
although I can't empathize
with your past,

185
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,920
I'll be your best listener

186
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,000
from now on.

187
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:29,720
