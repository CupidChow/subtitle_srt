17
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,120
Xiao Han.

18
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,400
What new game

19
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,400
are you playing today?

20
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,480
What's wrong with you?

21
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,600
I know the plan hasn't gone smoothly.

22
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,960
But so what?

23
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,560
We've already waited so many years.

24
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,560
We can wait a little longer.

25
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,240
The plague in Yizhou
is just a beginning.

26
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,840
Xiao Xingheng

27
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,880
won't remain triumphant for long.

28
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,840
Seven years ago,

29
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,320
17 palace maids in Yeting
died of illness successively.

30
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,080
Do you still remember?

31
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,920
The records indicate that

32
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,400
the 17 palace maids first had symptoms

33
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:21,360
of fever, cough, and high fever,
followed by difficulty breathing

34
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,760
half a month before their deaths.

35
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,320
These symptoms

36
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,280
are identical to those

37
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,800
of the current plague in Yizhou.

38
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,840
You and I both know

39
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,240
where did that plague come from.

40
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,040
Why?

41
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,080
Your Highness,

42
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,440
who was it you wanted to kill

43
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,040
back then in Yeting?

44
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,680
I've been tossing and turning,

45
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,720
unable to sleep for several nights.

46
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,560
After much thought, I believe

47
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,840
it can only be one person.

48
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,520
When did you find out?

49
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,200
From the night you tried
to kill Ning Chuxi.

50
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,000
That's early.

51
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,440
Then why are you only
asking me about it now?

52
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,880
What do you want to hear?

53
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,880
Do you want me to say

54
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,800
I don't believe it?

55
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,000
Indeed, I sought evidence cautiously,

56
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,000
and tried to convince myself

57
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,000
that it was just a coincidence.

58
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,680
But Your Highness,

59
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,600
the plague in Yizhou

60
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,640
could only have been caused by you.

61
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,920
How could I not believe it?

62
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,520
Why did you kill my mother?

63
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:06,970
Let me tell you a story.

64
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,210
Once upon a time, there was a woman

65
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:16,360
who was sent to the palace as a gift
to gain favor for her sister

66
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,920
because her family
was eager to please the powerful.

67
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,080
She lived up to
her family's expectations

68
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,350
and won the Emperor's favor
for a few months,

69
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,040
even becoming pregnant.

70
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,040
However, she couldn't guard
against the intrigue in the harem.

71
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,000
Her child

72
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,200
was gone.

73
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,120
She also lost the chance to be a mother.

74
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,600
Then,

75
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,640
her sister's child grew up.

76
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,040
Her family began
to shift their ambitions

77
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,480
to vying for the throne.

78
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,680
They encouraged her

79
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,600
to adopt a prince as her own.

80
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,080
But controlling people's heart
is difficult.

81
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,560
She couldn't choose a prince

82
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,400
with a strong maternal family.

83
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,560
Only a child with nothing

84
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,160
and trapped in despair

85
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,800
could be molded into a loyal tool.

86
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,280
I need you.

87
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,160
I won't give you any way out.

88
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,720
So you killed my mother.

89
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,840
That's because she deserved to die.

90
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,720
She was only a palace maid

91
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,080
but got pregnant with a prince.

92
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,120
She wouldn't live long in this palace

93
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,200
even if I didn't do anything.

94
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:04,080
So it was a conspiracy
from the beginning.

95
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:09,090
You said you never trusted anyone,

96
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,680
but you believed
that I wouldn't kill you.

97
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,600
How ridiculous.

98
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,290
Ten years ago,

99
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,570
I thought

100
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,200
you were a ray of light in my abyss.

101
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,720
Yet you were also the one
who pushed me into it!

102
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,320
Xiao Han, stop.

103
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,600
Did you know
from the first time I saw you,

104
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,720
I've never treated you as an aunt?

105
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,440
Don't be afraid.

106
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,880
On the road to the underworld,

107
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,880
I will be by your side.

108
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,360
Wait for me.

109
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,200
Unexpectedly,

110
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,720
I would see you again

111
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,760
before I died.

112
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,720
You killed her?

113
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,460
She deserved to die,

114
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,520
didn't she?

115
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,880
I did it for you

116
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,680
so you wouldn't get your hands dirty.

117
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,940
Her crimes will be dealt with

118
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,800
by the law of Great Li.

119
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,490
It's not your place to execute her.

120
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,200
Xiao Xingheng,

121
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,520
did you know?

122
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,320
I hate the man

123
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,120
who made my mother's life miserable.

124
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:54,000
I hate all those siblings
who share the same father as me,

125
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,240
yet our lives are worlds apart.

126
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,720
I hate everyone in this palace

127
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,520
who fawns on the powerful
and bullies the weak.

128
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,160
I also want to know what feels like

129
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,320
to control someone's life.

130
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,440
Sometimes,

131
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,650
I truly envy you, Xiao Xingheng.

132
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,760
Like me,

133
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,520
you were abandoned at a young age,

134
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,960
suffered in the Liu Kingdom,

135
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,920
and neglected by the court officials
and the Emperor when you returned.

136
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,420
But you were luckier than me.

137
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:40,200
Your maternal family
is prominent and powerful,

138
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:45,240
and you have the affection of Ning Chuxi
and the support of Prince Ning.

139
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,890
But I

140
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,400
have nothing.

141
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,080
Even the one I loved
and trusted the most

142
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,360
didn't really stay true to me.

143
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,720
Xiao Han,

144
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,960
don't be so obsessive.

145
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,800
You can still mend.

146
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,110
Mend?

147
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,540
It's too late.

148
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,960
From now on,

149
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,280
no one will dare to bully you.

150
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:15,510
(In the next life,
let's have a fresh start.)

151
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,590
They...

152
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,840
Don't look.

153
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,440
This is Jianmao Grass brought
from the northern frontier.

154
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,890
Jianmao Grass? What is that?

155
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:14,280
People in the northern frontier
usually boil Jianmao Grass in water.

156
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,440
They believe that the water

157
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,010
can then dispel the cold
and ward off evil.

158
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,520
Therefore, many people like
to bathe in such water

159
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,920
when they encounter misfortune,

160
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,720
or use it to keep warm in severe cold.

161
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,560
Could this be the medicine
to treat the plague?

162
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,960
Right, I've already
given some to the physician

163
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,480
and asked him to give it
to the sick soldiers in Yizhou.

164
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:40,240
Your Highness, Your Grace.

165
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,600
I brewed the Jianmao Grass
into a thick juice

166
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,400
and fed it to some
critically ill patients.

167
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,120
Their fevers have started to drop.

168
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,560
Jianmao Grass really works!

169
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,840
So,

170
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,100
is there enough stock
of Jianmao Grass in Yizhou?

171
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,360
Well, Jianmao Grass
comes from the northern frontier

172
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,320
and is used mainly for warmth
and to ward off evil.

173
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,320
It wasn't considered a medicinal herb,

174
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,600
so I overlooked it.

175
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,000
It's usually sold

176
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,360
as a niche item,

177
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:16,720
so supplies are limited.

178
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,880
Don't worry, I've arranged people

179
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:28,510
to transport the stock
from nearby cities

180
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,000
to Yizhou urgently.

181
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,640
I'll also contact other regions

182
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,720
for help

183
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:37,190
and have the court bring in more
from the northern frontier.

184
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,800
Once we have a treatment,

185
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,870
lifting the lockdown on Yizhou
will just be a matter of time.

186
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,240
Since the Jianmao Grass
comes from the northern frontier,

187
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:51,360
Xiao Xu must have been involved

188
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,480
in Noble Consort Sun's plan this time.

189
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Right.

190
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:59,200
He's been colluding with
their eldest prince.

191
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,200
Indeed.

192
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,000
His Highness and Her Grace
are handing out herbs to everyone!

193
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,760
Everyone, come and get it!

194
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,040
Fellows, hurry and get the herbs!

195
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,400
Thank you.

196
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,080
- Wonderful!
- Great!

197
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:21,580
Thank you.

198
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,360
- Thank you.
- Great, we're saved!

199
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,760
Wonderful!

200
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:03,320
That's great!

201
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,960
Great!

202
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,040
Your Highness.

203
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,090
The plan in Yizhou has failed.

204
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,800
The Crown Prince rushed back
to the palace last night.

205
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,330
The palace has spread news

206
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,890
that the Noble Consort
and the Fifth Prince have already...

207
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,990
The Crown Prince went
to see Xiao Han. I'm afraid...

208
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,120
I'm afraid
we'll need to advance the plan.

209
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:47,320
Yes.
