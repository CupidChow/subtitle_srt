=Episode 10=

17
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,480
It seems he usually
pays attention to me.

18
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,160
Perhaps.

19
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:40,310
Your Highness, you're here too.

20
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,840
Your Grace,
I have something to say to you.

21
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,160
May we speak

22
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:49,490
in private?

23
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,560
She is not available.

24
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,800
Her Grace is not yet married.

25
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,240
If there's something, speak here.

26
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,220
Your Highness is indeed thoughtful.

27
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,920
Your Grace, regarding the rescue
on the street last time,

28
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,040
I haven't yet had the chance

29
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,320
to properly thank you for your help.

30
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,320
Don't mind that.

31
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,880
It was just a small effort.

32
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:22,000
It was indeed abrupt that my brother

33
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,480
requested marriage for me last time.

34
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,130
But I truly admire you.

35
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,240
Thank you, Second Prince.

36
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,510
But you also know

37
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,440
that our statuses are worlds apart.

38
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,920
I'm afraid I might disappoint you.

39
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:47,940
Actually, from the moment
I knew you were Princess Yuexi,

40
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,360
I guessed this would be the outcome.

41
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,400
But I refuse to give up.

42
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,760
I just wanted to tell you personally

43
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,440
that even if we can't be lovers,

44
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,640
we can at least be friends, right?

45
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:09,280
In a few days, I'll return to Beiqiong.

46
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,360
I haven't had a proper tour
of the capital.

47
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:14,180
Before I leave,

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
would you have time

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,520
to show me around the city?

50
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,600
No problem. I should
extend the host's courtesy.

51
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,720
Your Grace, the carriage

52
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,920
has been waiting at the gate
for quite some time.

53
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,280
I didn't call for a carriage, did I?

54
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,120
Your Grace, please.

55
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,400
(Must be another episode.)

56
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,880
Alright then.

57
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,200
Second Prince,

58
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,640
didn't you have something
to discuss with me?

59
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,600
Didn't you say...

60
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,650
There's no better time than now.
Let's go.

61
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,200
You don't need to walk me out.

62
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,680
His Highness asks you to stay.

63
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,800
Does he want me to leave or stay?

64
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:19,200
Your Grace, please have a seat.

65
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,540
(Isn't this Xiao Xingheng's study?)

66
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,230
Why bring me here?

67
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,520
You'll know shortly.

68
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,040
Second Prince, what does this mean?

69
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,280
(So Xiao Xingheng asked me to stay)

70
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,240
(just to eavesdrop here?)

71
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,960
Naturally, to discuss
a collaboration with you.

72
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,120
We're on different sides,
how can we collaborate?

73
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,880
You might not be aware

74
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,400
that your Third Prince has already

75
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,050
made an agreement
with my eldest brother.

76
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,240
Second Prince, you accuse
my brother of collusion

77
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,280
without proof.

78
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,480
How can I believe this?

79
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,920
Your Third Prince has,
per my eldest brother's request,

80
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,400
placed many spies
within the Ning's troops.

81
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,000
Check it yourself and you'll know.

82
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,660
(Why does this involve my family?)

83
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,970
May I ask you for clarification

84
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:12,800
to show your sincerity?

85
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,000
He Louqing promised to help Xiao Xu

86
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,780
seize military power
from the Ning family.

87
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,200
As long as Xiao Xu
provides intelligence,

88
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,080
Beiqiong will win every battle.

89
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,040
By then, half of the Ning's troops
would be lost

90
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,280
and Emperor Shaoyuan
would lose trust in Prince Ning

91
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,380
and appoint another general.

92
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,560
If Prince Ning
refuses to relinquish power,

93
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,280
Xiao Xu will join forces with He Louqing

94
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,080
to accuse Prince Ning of treason.

95
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:40,000
(That concerns the lives
of 150,000 soldiers!)

96
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,960
(How could Xiao Xu do this?)

97
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,800
Your Grace, do not worry.
With His Highness here,

98
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,920
the Ning's troops
will not fall into danger.

99
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,320
(Xiao Xu, if you dare to harm my family,)

100
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,280
(I will make you pay tenfold!)

101
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,520
Soldiers should die in battle,

102
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,680
not in the political struggles
of those in power.

103
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,160
Such an act defies natural justice.

104
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,920
I will not stand idly by.

105
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,320
Even I'm from the rival nation,
this is too cruel.

106
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,840
My brother always leaves no way back.

107
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,680
If he ascends the throne,

108
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,750
I would no longer have
a foothold in Beiqiong.

109
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,200
Therefore, both publicly and privately,

110
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,600
I do not wish for him to succeed.

111
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,520
So, why do you

112
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,280
choose to cooperate with me?

113
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,160
You are the Crown Prince

114
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,680
and Great Li's heir.

115
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,460
You naturally
do not fear the Third Prince.

116
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:36,280
I assume that even if
you're not perfect in virtue,

117
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,480
you must have exceptional qualities.

118
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:42,190
And I trust her judgment.

119
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,000
You are sincere and genuine.

120
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,320
I must say, I benefit
from Princess Yuexi's favor.

121
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,560
I wonder what conditions you have
for cooperating with me.

122
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,280
I don't wish to go to war with Great Li

123
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,840
and trade lives for resources.

124
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,920
I hope that after you ascend the throne,

125
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,960
you will open mutual trade
in the northern border towns,

126
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,400
so that the citizens of Beiqiong

127
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:12,240
can enjoy the same rights
as the citizens of Great Li

128
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,440
without being driven away.

129
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,360
Deal.

130
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,120
I've benefited from your good fortune

131
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,480
to conclude things so quickly

132
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,840
with He Louche.

133
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,760
You don't seem happy.

134
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:57,640
Not at all.

135
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:06,480
I will have my father
carefully investigate in the troops.

136
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,110
Those spies pose a serious threat.

137
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,840
Don't worry.

138
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,960
I'll also have someone investigate,

139
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,040
start with Xiao Xu.

140
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:24,800
So why are you unhappy?

141
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:41,240
(A leader's thoughts
are indeed hard to guess.)

142
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,220
(Dedication and Wisdom)

143
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,280
Where did you learn this information?

144
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,400
I... I...

145
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,600
Well,

146
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,520
never mind where
the information came from.

147
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,680
Just go and investigate it.

148
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,940
Of course, I'll investigate.

149
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,120
If anyone dares to meddle in my troops,

150
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,530
it won't be so easy.

151
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,920
Yes.

152
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,320
Wait a minute.

153
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,840
You returned from
the Crown Prince's banquet today

154
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:13,490
and immediately told me
this information.

155
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,600
Was it the Crown Prince?

156
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,520
I knew it. You trouble-scared slacker.

157
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,920
At the birthday banquet last time,

158
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,230
you were so protective of him.

159
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,380
It turns out
you've taken a liking to him!

160
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:31,330
Xiao Xingheng did tell me.

161
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,480
But things aren't how you imagine them.

162
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,150
You even call him by his name.

163
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,600
If it's not that, then what is it?

164
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,400
What are you thinking?

165
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,720
There's nothing going on yet.

166
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,370
Judging from this situation,

167
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:44,720
something is going to happen.

168
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,640
I...

169
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,880
(I can't believe there's a day when I)

170
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,550
(can't win an argument
with this old man.)

171
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:52,800
The Crown Prince is good-looking,

172
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,520
but his health...

173
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,320
You won't end up widowed, will you?

174
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,670
Is that the point?

175
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,800
No.

176
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,820
If I truly get together
with Xiao Xingheng,

177
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,230
shouldn't you be considering

178
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,320
the future of our family?

179
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,240
Why do you care about his health?

180
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,800
What future?

181
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,620
If you really want to marry him,

182
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,750
our family will back you up.

183
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,680
I'm loyal and patriotic.

184
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,820
And I'll be loyal
to the Crown Prince too.

185
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,650
Wisdom comes with age.

186
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,670
Well,

187
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,260
girls can't be kept at home
when they grow up.

188
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:31,850
That's not true.

189
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,940
I can stay here until the end of time.

190
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,210
Don't let it burden you.

191
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,160
You're still a young girl.

192
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,650
Why think so much?

193
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,280
If you like him, go after him.

194
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,100
If you both like each other,
then be together.

195
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:48,440
If the sky falls,
your old man will hold it up.

196
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:51,030
You needn't worry.

197
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,960
Now will you tell me

198
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,780
how far you two have gotten?

199
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:08,680
You better go deal
with proper matters. Bye.

200
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,720
You... You...

201
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,440
This child.

202
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,960
Spies. I've been keeping
my head down for so many years.

203
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:23,720
Seems some people

204
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,990
have forgotten how I earned my title.

205
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,540
(Three days later)

206
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,800
What do you plan to do

207
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:34,500
with that maid
who stole your handkerchief?

208
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,040
Did she confess?

209
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:40,690
You're right. It's Lin Yudai.

210
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,090
The maid's testimony
likely won't be of much use.

211
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,320
Xiao Xu should've already
talked with Chen Fen.

212
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,920
Xiao Xu even asked me for this maid.

213
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,010
He's trying to cover this up.

214
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:57,170
Did you give her to him?

215
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,800
I'm waiting for your instructions.

216
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:01,480
Oh, stop it.

217
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,120
There's not much we can do to Lin Yudai.

218
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,040
Just give her to him.

219
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,240
But not for free.

220
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,080
If he wants Lin Yudai
to come out clean in this matter,

221
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:19,030
he'll have to pay some price.

222
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:25,360
By the way, I caught Xiao Xu's spy

223
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:27,920
planted in the northern border army.

224
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,140
That fast?

225
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,360
When he was transporting
provisions to the north,

226
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,700
he was caught
before even leaving the city.

227
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,400
Impressive speed.

228
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,010
You seem so curious.

229
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,650
Want to interrogate him together?

230
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,310
Me? Interrogate with you?

231
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,360
Alright.

232
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:06,730
Speak.

233
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,680
Who else has received orders to spy?

234
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:21,800
You are Princess Yuexi?

235
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:29,300
So, you've colluded
with the Crown Prince.

236
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,880
What do you mean by collude?

237
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,600
Do you even know how to speak properly?

238
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,160
Princess Yuexi, do you know

239
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,520
the person by your side?

240
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,080
He looks gentle and elegant,

241
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,520
but in fact, he's a murderous demon,

242
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,960
a ruthless and vicious madman!

243
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,050
Nonsense.

244
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,920
Do you know?

245
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,600
Under this luxurious mansion,

246
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,670
there's a hidden dungeon.

247
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:58,600
You should really go
and see for yourself

248
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,030
what is inside.

249
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,080
Seems you don't know.

250
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,440
Alright, I'll tell you.

251
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:08,210
Inside are the private prisoners
hidden by the Crown Prince.

252
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:09,880
Inside, the prisoners

253
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,250
are going through endless torment

254
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,100
in the dark dungeon.

255
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,360
Look!

256
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,330
My scapula has been pierced by them.

257
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,180
And my fingers,

258
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:23,820
they were broken one by one

259
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:25,840
then reconnected, one by one.

260
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:29,290
They even used knives as thin as paper

261
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:33,160
to slice my body repeatedly

262
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,010
and sprinkled salt on the wounds.

263
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,080
Princess Yuexi,

264
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,400
have you seen human skin?

265
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,900
Real human skin.

266
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,400
Just yesterday,

267
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,250
your Crown Prince

268
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,440
personally skinned a prisoner

269
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:54,130
alive.

270
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,010
A big piece.

271
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,600
It was bloody and translucent.

272
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,600
Enough!

273
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,840
There's even more fascinating tales.

274
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,280
I'll tell you slowly.

275
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,180
Master.

276
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,920
Escort Princess Yuexi back.

277
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,320
Yes.

278
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,470
Why are you standing there?

279
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:47,680
You could have waited
until after interrogation to tell her.

280
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,860
Why release the spy

281
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:52,040
and let him tell her all this?

282
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:58,660
You did it on purpose?

283
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,100
Why?

284
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,200
He wanted to test Her Grace.

285
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,210
Too bad, he lost the bet.
