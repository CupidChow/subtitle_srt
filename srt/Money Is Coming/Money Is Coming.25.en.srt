=Episode 25=

17
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,760
Your Majesty,
it's time for your medicine.

18
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,740
My time is running out.

19
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,510
Your Majesty, you're blessed.

20
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,800
Your health will soon be restored.

21
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:39,640
This is a punishment
from the heavens for me,

22
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:47,320
and the plague is a warning.

23
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:50,720
I've gone against the natural order.

24
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:55,280
I was destined to face this calamity.

25
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,080
The plague has been brought
under control by the Crown Prince.

26
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,440
He has brought blessings
to the people on your behalf.

27
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,960
This is also thanks to you,
Your Majesty.

28
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,480
Th Crown Prince.

29
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,240
Come, help me up.

30
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,610
Be careful, Your Majesty.

31
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,600
You should drink the medicine first.

32
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:27,160
I must draft a decree.

33
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,730
I'm going to pass the throne
to the Crown Prince.

34
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,280
Summon the ministers tomorrow.

35
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,120
I'll proclaim this to the world.

36
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,440
The Crown Prince is benevolent

37
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:48,630
and can bring blessings to the people.

38
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,040
Yes.

39
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:12,680
Today is your last task.

40
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,360
Failure is not an option.

41
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,640
Yes.

42
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,840
What's that noise outside?

43
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,570
Huailiu, go!

44
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,620
(Xingchen Palace)

45
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,080
Huailiu, you can't do it
without me, can you?

46
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,600
What can I do about that?

47
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,320
What on earth is that noise outside?

48
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,720
Why are you closing your eyes?

49
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,900
You think I'm going to
do something to you?

50
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,840
Time to sleep.

51
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,960
Then the boy found his iris

52
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,000
and lived happily ever after

53
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,640
with his flower.

54
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,360
Why does this sound so familiar?

55
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,320
Does it?

56
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,600
It's the story I told you.

57
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,280
You just mixed them up.

58
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,440
Alright, you caught me.

59
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,160
Now, go to sleep.

60
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,440
Master, news has come from the palace.

61
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,840
His Majesty is seriously ill.

62
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,680
I'm afraid...

63
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,560
His life is in danger.

64
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,500
Xiao Xu was afraid
His Majesty would die suddenly

65
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,480
and the Crown Prince will
claim the throne,

66
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,200
that's why he acted hastily.

67
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,680
Since Xiao Xu has taken action,

68
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,040
he must have some backup plans.

69
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,400
Tomorrow, you're not

70
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,320
attending a royal banquet,

71
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,640
but rather a trap.

72
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,640
Just a trap.

73
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,240
Compared to my time as the hostage,
this is nothing to fear.

74
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,520
Tomorrow, there will likely
be a fierce battle.

75
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,720
Your residence will not be spared.

76
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,000
Huailiu,

77
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,350
after I leave home tomorrow morning,

78
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,380
escort Her Grace back
to Prince Ning's Residence.

79
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,540
Make sure she's safe before you leave.

80
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,400
Master, what about you?

81
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,920
As long as she's safe,

82
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,720
I'll have nothing to worry about.

83
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,800
Xiao Xu cannot win.

84
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,160
Tomorrow,

85
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,880
I'll bring the private troops
from the Duke of State's Mansion

86
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,880
to wait for you outside the palace.

87
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,520
If anything happens,

88
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,560
we'll storm in.

89
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,200
Alright.

90
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,720
Why it feels like the calm
before a storm?

91
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,990
Your Grace.

92
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,240
Huailiu.

93
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,320
Huailiu, where's Xiao Xingheng?

94
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,520
Why haven't I seen him all morning?

95
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,960
Master has gone out on business today.

96
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,520
He ordered me
to stay and guard the residence.

97
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,000
He said since we returned from Yizhou,

98
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,880
you must want to see Prince Ning.

99
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,080
After you wake up,

100
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,120
I'll escort you back home.

101
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,760
Why he suddenly asked me to return home?

102
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:13,460
Huailiu, be honest with me.

103
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,590
Where exactly is Xiao Xingheng?

104
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,840
The Crown Prince has arrived!

105
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,640
Xingheng, you still love to show off,

106
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,040
attracting everyone's attention.

107
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,280
Sorry for being late, Father.

108
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,600
This is the full story.

109
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,360
So Master has to make sure you're safe

110
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,840
to deal with Xiao Xu
without distraction.

111
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,040
Huailiu, I need you
to do something for me.

112
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,280
As you wish, Your Grace.

113
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,760
I will host a grand banquet
at Wei Garden today,

114
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:16,160
inviting the families of the officials
to enjoy the beautiful scenery.

115
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,120
Master is still there.

116
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,890
Isn't it inappropriate
to host a banquet now?

117
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,480
What are you thinking?

118
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,620
Consider it done, Your Grace.

119
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,760
Not too late.

120
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,280
So the news about Father's illness

121
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,040
has spread across the court.

122
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,080
You must have chosen

123
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,680
the new sovereign.

124
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,480
But Father is still here,
sitting safely on the throne.

125
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,440
Yet you are all so impatient.

126
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,360
Could it be that you wish
to force his abdication?

127
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,360
You're mistaken.

128
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,320
A wise man adapts to circumstances.

129
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,280
They have merely made the best choice.

130
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,440
Father is old and gravely ill.

131
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,480
He's no longer fit
to be the ruler of the nation.

132
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,560
It's better for him to abdicate early.

133
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,080
As the Crown Prince,

134
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,560
I'm still not ready
to take on the heavy burden.

135
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,840
Yet you seem more eager
than both Father and me.

136
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,080
It doesn't matter, now

137
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,480
all you can do is talk.

138
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,920
Father, I believe

139
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,620
that the Crown Prince
is undeserving of his title.

140
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,780
He is incompetent and unfit
for greater responsibility.

141
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,000
Today, I sincerely ask you

142
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,200
to depose the Crown Prince
and appoint a new heir.

143
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,320
Miss Li, why are you here?

144
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,840
I was going to ask the same, Mrs. Zhao.

145
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,200
Her Grace's invitation clearly
said only I was invited.

146
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,880
My invitation also said the same.

147
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,720
So does mine.

148
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,560
Your Grace, what is going on here?

149
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:53,960
It's true

150
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,960
that I deceived you all.

151
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,400
I invited you here today

152
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,160
to borrow your lives

153
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,560
for my husband's life.

154
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:03,530
Hurry.

155
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:17,560
Your Grace, are you joking?

156
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,680
There are so many of us here.

157
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,760
Are you planning to kill us all?

158
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,560
Mrs. Zhao, you're right.

159
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:29,640
But I can kill you today

160
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:33,640
and kill her tomorrow.

161
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,800
This way,

162
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,880
it won't appear overly merciful

163
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,160
or excessively cruel.

164
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,680
We all know you're kind

165
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,320
and saved countless plague victims.

166
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,160
How could you kill the innocent?

167
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,210
Exactly.

168
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,280
Unfortunately, I am quite fickle.

169
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,480
I couldn't bear to bury flowers.

170
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,560
But today, I can bury you.

171
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,880
If you cooperate well with me,

172
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,040
there's still room for negotiation.

173
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,120
Outrageous!

174
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,400
I must leave today.

175
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,380
What can you do about it?

176
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,640
I think you haven't fully
understood the situation.

177
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,400
What I mean is,

178
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,760
anyone who leaves the Wei Garden

179
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,840
without my orders today

180
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,120
will be executed on the spot.

181
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,720
Do you dare?

182
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,160
You can try me.

183
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,160
Everyone, please rest assured.

184
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,880
Since you're all here for the banquet,

185
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,920
