17
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,480
I've sent the eunuch in charge

18
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,800
to report back to Hanzhang Palace

19
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,320
that you happened to see
Princess Yuexi faint,

20
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,840
and placed her in an outer hall
near your residence.

21
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,200
The physician said
it's just a cold and not serious,

22
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,900
so Noble Consort Sun
doesn't need to worry.

23
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,080
Alright.

24
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,600
Hanzhang Palace has been quite restless.

25
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,440
It's time to give them a lesson.

26
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,340
(Dedication and Wisdom)

27
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:03,200
Miss, do you still remember
what happened yesterday?

28
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,440
Yesterday?

29
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,440
We're taking off!

30
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,600
I want to fly higher.

31
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,880
Shall we sleep?

32
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,710
Yesterday...

33
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,520
It's over, it's over.

34
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,440
I took the drug that a female lead
normally takes.

35
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,760
I'm so embarrassing.

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,320
You've remembered now?

37
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,360
Let this world be destroyed.

38
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:38,480
Let the male and female leads
hurry up and kill me.

39
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,600
It's all Xiao Yue'er's fault.

40
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,560
She gave me
such an embarrassing drug.

41
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,600
Miss, Miss, where are you going?

42
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,760
You're not dressed yet, Miss.

43
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,880
(Dedication and Wisdom)

44
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,200
Old man.

45
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,960
Old man, your daughter's been bullied.

46
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,000
Just say what you're going to do.

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,240
Who dares to bully you?

48
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,760
I haven't asked you.

49
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,060
How did you leave standing
but return lying down?

50
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,960
If it weren't for
the guards and the physician

51
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,920
repeatedly assuring
that you only have a cold,

52
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,280
I thought you were going to die.

53
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,760
What cold? The Fourth Princess

54
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,080
gave me something to drink.

55
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,240
And then this happened.

56
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,650
They've gone too far!

57
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,040
Exactly.

58
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,760
But old man, you can't

59
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,130
take a sword
and cut down the Hanzhang Palace.

60
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,650
Be careful, or you'll ruin your health.

61
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,760
Although we can't cut down
the Hanzhang Palace,

62
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,680
I can still manage

63
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,760
to make those two restless.

64
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,280
Good.

65
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,240
Let them be restless.

66
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,280
I have a report to make.

67
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,400
Speak.

68
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,160
The Fourth Princess held
a banquet at Wei Garden

69
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,050
and cost a great deal.

70
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,360
(Emperor Shaoyuan)
And ten days ago,

71
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,200
she took the descendants
of the Sun family on an outing.

72
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,560
For the convenience of enjoyment,

73
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,600
she ignored the desperate pleas
of the farmers

74
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,440
and trampled over more than
50 acres of farmland on a horse.

75
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,320
I also have a matter to report.

76
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,560
Sun Wei, sold offices and titles,
making a profit of ten thousand.

77
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,600
This is the account list I obtained.

78
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,480
He's just a sixth-rank official.

79
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,600
By selling offices
and evaluations of appointments,

80
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,120
he's made ten thousand liang.

81
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:33,440
This could rival the annual
tax revenue of some small counties.

82
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,820
How bold!

83
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,270
Is Sun Wei

84
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,440
from your Sun family?

85
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,580
(Minister Sun)

86
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,360
He is a distant relative of my family.

87
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,840
Although he is a distant relative,

88
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,400
anyone with eyes can see

89
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,640
these branches of the Sun family

90
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,800
all rely on Noble Consort Sun
and Minister Sun

91
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,200
to secure some positions and titles.

92
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,960
Sun Wei sold offices and titles.

93
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,840
He will be stripped of his office
and exiled to Yaozhou.

94
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,920
Also, those who engage in bribery
will be investigated.

95
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,560
Originally,
the Fourth Princess's matter

96
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,680
wasn't that serious.

97
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,930
Who would have thought that
Sun Wei would be exposed?

98
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,290
Now, His Majesty is troubled by this

99
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,310
and Noble Consort Sun
is also caught in the scandal.

100
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,270
Truly, Heaven has opened its eyes.

101
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,200
It's like a timely rain has fallen.

102
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,600
The Sun family
has been too reckless lately

103
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,480
and annoyed so many people.

104
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,950
Father, you're a man of your word.

105
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,480
Noble Consort Sun
and the Fourth Princess

106
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:44,440
are going to have a rough time.

107
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,000
By the way,

108
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:49,000
did you go thank the Crown Prince?

109
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,080
Although the Crown Prince
has no real power,

110
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,880
he is still the heir to the throne.

111
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,920
And he helped you.

112
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,400
The proper etiquette
should be observed.

113
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,680
What help did he give me?

114
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,640
Old man, I didn't do anything.

115
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,160
Why are you so anxious?

116
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,940
The Crown Prince
saw that you were drugged

117
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,360
and kindly took you back.

118
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,400
Yes, yes, yes, I should
definitely thank him for this.

119
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,120
Then what are you waiting for? Go!

120
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,960
Now?

121
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:19,240
Of course. We always
return the favors immediately.

122
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,840
Hurry up, and come back early.

123
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:28,260
(Dedication and Wisdom)

124
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,750
You're going like this?

125
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:58,400
I'm really sorry about last time.

126
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,720
Which matter are you referring to?

127
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,080
(Why he has to bring this up?)

128
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,800
Is it that you held on to me

129
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,920
or that you took advantage of me
under the influence of the drug?

130
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,720
Don't humiliate me like this.

131
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,160
Are you doing this on purpose?

132
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,080
It was the effect of the drug,
you don't need to mind that.

133
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,280
But I still need to thank you
for helping me out.

134
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,000
Your Grace, why don't you

135
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,350
move here?

136
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,360
Isn't that be a bit too obvious?

137
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,340
Going to your residence every day

138
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,170
is like announcing to the world

139
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,650
that we have a relationship.

140
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,760
What relationship?

141
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,190
It's just like

142
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,920
we have underhand secret dealings.

143
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,160
No.

144
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,350
We can have Huailiu drive
the carriage to the back courtyard

145
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:57,040
then switch to another carriage.

146
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,980
There's a passage
straight to the inner hall.

147
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,480
It won't attract attention.

148
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,400
The inner hall is full of my people,
you need not worry.

149
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,680
It won't be too troublesome, will it?

150
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,080
- Greetings, Your Highness.
- Greetings, Your Highness.

151
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,040
These two are chefs
I brought from Jiangnan.

152
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,320
The best chefs in the capital
have all learned from them.

153
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,240
The daily necessities in the inner hall

154
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,350
are definitely more exquisite
than those in the back courtyard.

155
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,880
The back courtyard is just
a temporary resting place, also...

156
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,760
No need to say more, I agree.

157
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,080
It takes more than a few days to heal.

158
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:31,680
No matter how comfortable
I make it, it's still just a room.

159
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,600
I worry that you might
feel bored staying there.

160
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,960
You're very thoughtful.
I just need some good food and drink.

161
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,640
But does this count as moving in?

162
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,040
Sort of, but not exactly.

163
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,280
We're here anyway.

164
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,080
Your Highness, would you like
to lie down for a while?

165
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,040
Now? Lie down?

166
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,360
Don't worry, treatment is free today.

167
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,360
Is this bed comfortable?

168
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,910
Then let's talk about something serious.

169
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,560
It will be the Longevity Festival
in just a few days.

170
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:20,360
What? Is there some trouble again?

171
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,240
I got a tip-off

172
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,240
that Xiao Xu has been frequently
corresponding with the post station.

173
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,200
I don't know which envoy
he's in contact with.

174
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,560
No matter which country it is,

175
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,480
we'll know when he pulls this trick.

176
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,990
However, this is confidential.

177
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,960
Why are you telling me this?

178
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,480
I thought we were allies.

179
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,870
That's right.

180
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,470
Don't expect me
to come up with plans for you

181
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,080
or do anything personally.

182
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:59,640
At most, I'll use my father's power

183
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,320
to give you a little help
in critical moments.

184
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,840
I don't want you to do anything for me.

185
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm just sharing
my intelligence with you.

186
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,840
Oh.

187
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,360
Go to sleep now.

188
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,800
I'll have to go home for dinner
in four hours.

189
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,250
The old man is watching me closely.

190
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,600
Everyone, come quickly!

191
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,200
- Let me go.
- Everyone come and judge.

192
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,360
This foreign man has been

193
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,800
attempting improper actions
toward me in broad daylight.

194
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,840
Everyone, come quickly!

195
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,440
Don't leave.

196
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,380
Everyone, come quickly!

197
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,600
It's him.

198
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,120
He was attempting
improper actions toward me.

199
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,320
Everyone, come quickly!

200
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,170
Let's go see.

201
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:11,030
Go, go, go.

202
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,250
- Don't leave.
- Let go.

203
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,160
Everyone, come quickly.

204
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,200
Let go, I didn't do it.

205
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,160
Please come and help me.

206
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,440
This foreign man is going too far.

207
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,920
Please help me say something.

208
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,880
You're lying. I didn't touch you.

209
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,840
I went out today to shop.

210
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,240
Who would have thought
this foreign man

211
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,560
would be attracted to me

212
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:48,440
and tried to do

213
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,960
improper things to me?

214
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,160
You're talking nonsense.

215
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,160
Please, help me.

216
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:59,280
Why not report this to officials?
I'm not the chief magistrate.

217
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,440
I can't have this man arrested.

218
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,560
He's a foreigner.

219
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,400
The authorities may not
dare to deal with him.

220
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:09,680
But luckily, I'm fine now.

221
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,160
I just want him to compensate me
with money.

222
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:20,120
If you're trying to use me as a pawn,

223
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,760
that's unlikely to work.

224
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,020
No, you misunderstand.

225
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,640
I'm not.

226
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:29,400
Smells so good.

227
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,120
If you don't tell the truth now,

228
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,170
I'll send someone
to the Imperial Office of Music

229
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,650
to check your household registration.

230
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,720
Mei, go to the Imperial Office of Music.

231
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,040
Yes.

232
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:40,960
No.

233
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,360
He didn't assault me.

234
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,960
I saw he was a foreigner,

235
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,520
so I came up with this idea
to make money.

236
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,140
I won't do it again, please show mercy.

237
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,580
She's falsely accusing you.

238
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:00,540
Whether to report it to the authorities
is up to you.

239
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,200
I won't argue with such women.

240
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:09,120
Thank you, sir.
You are kind, thank you.

241
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,470
Let's go.

242
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:14,860
- What a waste of time.
- Let's go.

243
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,640
Miss, I am He Louche.

244
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,680
Thank you for helping me out.

245
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,100
May I have your name
to go thank you properly in person?

246
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,480
Isn't "He"
a royal surname in Beiqiong?

247
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,950
It was just a small favor,
no need to mention it.

248
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,780
I wonder how you knew

249
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,850
that woman was falsely accusing me.

250
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,400
No decent woman,

251
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:37,570
after being assaulted,

252
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:39,520
would instinctively
leave her shoulder exposed

253
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,220
instead of clutching
her clothes tightly,

254
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,680
fearing that others might not notice.

255
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,560
And the perfume she's wearing

256
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,960
is distributed and prepared
by the Imperial Office of Music.

257
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,240
The women in brothels

258
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,710
all use that perfume.

259
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:53,440
That's impressive.

260
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:55,800
Then, may I ask

261
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:58,160
how do you know about this perfume?

262
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,990
Our young lady

263
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,100
has visited all the brothels in Yizhou,

264
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:02,960
so of course...

265
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,970
I've just smelled it.

266
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,320
But still, thank you.

267
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,760
Although you are reluctant
to tell me your name,

268
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,010
if you ever need

269
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,450
anything from me,

270
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:19,670
just send someone
to the post station to inform me.

271
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,900
I will do my best.

272
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,400
No need to worry about
such small matters.

273
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,920
See you.

274
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:38,070
Master.

275
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,580
Master, don't worry.

276
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:46,400
I won' let such lowly people

277
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,630
to enter Jiqing Workshop again.

278
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,960
From today on,

279
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,750
you will personally escort
Princess Yuexi home.

280
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,630
Don't let her
get off the carriage easily.

281
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,760
Yes.
