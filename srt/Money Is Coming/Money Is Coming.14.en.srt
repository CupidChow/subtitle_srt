=Episode 14=

17
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,620
(Half a month later)

18
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,290
What a good dream.

19
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,280
How did you get in here?

20
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,040
I climbed over the wall.

21
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,800
Plums.

22
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,280
Are the guards just for show?

23
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,440
Someone climbs over the wall
and they don't notice?

24
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:36,280
Where's Mei? Did you bribe her again?

25
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,000
Your maid is quite clever.

26
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,440
She has a good sense.

27
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,160
Neither of you takes the usual path.

28
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,120
What's wrong?

29
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,800
After all, it's my first time
falling in love.

30
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,520
I don't have much experience.

31
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,880
What?

32
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,100
You haven't thanked me yet.

33
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,240
Thank you for saving my life.

34
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,760
I have no way to repay you.

35
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,920
Only...

36
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:32,520
Actually, even if I didn't
take that arrow for you,

37
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,300
you probably wouldn't
have been hurt anyway.

38
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,400
That's overstated.

39
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:43,130
That won't do.

40
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,380
You did save my life.

41
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:52,360
Now you also know
that I'm not chronically ill,

42
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,690
but poisoned, right?

43
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:00,360
Before Princess Yuexi fell unconscious,

44
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,770
she unintentionally pulled
a wildflower by its roots

45
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,530
from the forest floor.

46
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:07,140
It is the Hidden Face Flower
we've been seeking.

47
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,030
Is this the hand of God?

48
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,120
However,

49
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,790
how did the mastermind
know about your poisoning?

50
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,000
There must be a mole on your side.

51
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,280
Do you think this assassination
was ordered by Xiao Xu?

52
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,480
I don't think so.

53
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,800
Why?

54
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,200
It's too deliberate
leaving the token at the scene.

55
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,320
If it were Xiao Xu's doing,

56
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,510
then he's be too stupid.

57
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,520
Xiao Xu may be arrogant,

58
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,480
but not foolish to this extent.

59
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,240
I think the mastermind
did it on purpose.

60
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,200
Knowing something is fishy,

61
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,240
he pushed Xiao Xu in front of everyone

62
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,040
to make His Majesty
and officials suspect him.

63
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,960
Then his goal is achieved.

64
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,240
Honestly,

65
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,480
if I didn't know
this assassination was real,

66
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,870
I would suspect it was you.

67
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,960
You guessed right.

68
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,360
Then this arrow...

69
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,180
The assassination was real.

70
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,320
But the token was placed by me.

71
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,600
You made me annoyed. It hurts.

72
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,400
You pulled on your wound? Let me see.

73
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,360
I'm fine, I was joking.

74
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,310
I'm already healed.

75
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:39,400
Really, really, really.

76
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,080
Alright.

77
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,920
When did you place it?

78
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,480
When Huailiu was dealing
with the hidden archers,

79
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,040
I placed it on the lead archer.

80
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,400
Xiao Xu is now directly
suspected as the mastermind.

81
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,800
With the token left at the scene,

82
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,120
others will inevitably suspect

83
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,240
if someone is framing him.

84
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,920
It was you

85
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,170
who left the token behind?

86
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,310
Why do you always distrust me?

87
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,160
I simply don't trust anyone.

88
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,400
Wow.

89
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,880
Brilliant, truly brilliant.

90
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,400
This assassination
might really be Xiao Xu's doing.

91
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,040
For the arrow you took,

92
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,240
I must make the mastermind
pay the price.

93
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,720
(That sounds like an ultimate villain.)

94
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,510
(But in this grand chaos,)

95
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:07,810
(the villains might not
have time for me.)

96
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,560
Why do I feel like
you're in a good mood?

97
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,680
Knowing the mastermind,
of course I'm happy.

98
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:16,400
But how much do people hate you?

99
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:19,360
Both of them
coincidentally want your life.

100
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,520
So I must thank you.

101
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,280
If you didn't risk your life to save me,

102
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,320
I would have perished here.

103
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,100
You're welcome.

104
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,750
(Xiao Xingheng spoils me so much.)

105
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,320
(Doesn't he actually)

106
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:01,350

doesn't open except for royal events?

132
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,640
Wei Garden is my private place.

133
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,500
You can come anytime you want.

134
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:28,500
Why did you want to bring me here today?

135
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:33,930
So, you can stroll with Helou Che

136
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,830
but not with me in Wei Garden?

137
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,670
Don't say it like that.

138
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:41,760
(Why is he jealous again?)

139
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:50,000
Do you have something to say to me?

140
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,320
Chuxi.

141
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,080
Xingheng.

142
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,640
Greetings.

143
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:20,290
I suppose this is Princess Yuexi.

144
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,130
How did you know I was here?

145
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,800
The Wei Garden
is a great place for flower viewing.

146
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,120
I thought you wouldn't
miss such beautiful scenery,

147
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,760
so I secretly came to try my luck

148
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,720
and see if I could run into you.

149
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,680
Sure enough, I was lucky today.

150
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:44,390
Is that so?

151
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:50,920
I heard that during the autumn hunt,

152
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,720
Her Grace saved your life.

153
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,750
So you truly are

154
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:57,330
a stunning beauty.

155
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:01,450
Thank you for saving my cousin's life.

156
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:03,030
(I saved Xiao Xingheng.)

157
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,680
(Why does his cousin need to thank me?)

158
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,050
May I ask your name?

159
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,390
I forgot to introduce myself.

160
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,180
I'm Bai Queyue,

161
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,840
Xingheng's cousin.

162
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,680
Uncle pitied me
for losing my father at a young age,

163
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,720
so he brought me here to live with him.

164
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,840
I see.

165
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,040
I saw you freely entering
the Crown Prince's private garden,

166
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,520
and thought you might be Miss Xiao.

167
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:30,720
You must be joking.

168
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,240
Master.

169
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,480
I'm going out. Wait here for me.

170
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,350
Are you aiming
to become the Crown Princess?

171
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,900
What does it have to do with you?

172
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,960
Do you know that beneath
my cousin's gentle demeanor

173
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,700
lies a ruthless heart?

174
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,800
(I'm almost used to his cruel side.)

175
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,840
It seems you know.

176
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,800
My cousin's body may be weak,

177
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,280
but he harbors great ambitions.

178
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,440
How do you know
that he's not treating you gently now

179
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:20,200
for your father's troops?

180
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,080
Troops?

181
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,560
My cousin is destined
to rule the world one day.

182
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,360
If you think he'll wholeheartedly

183
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,560
treat you as he does now,

184
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,920
then it's simply daydreaming.

185
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,840
Royal love is like these flowers,

186
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,240
beautiful but destined

187
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,320
to decay into mud.

188
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,720
By then, my cousin
will hold military power

189
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,960
and the past affection will fade.

190
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,360
And the people in the palace
will increase.

191
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,920
Aside from Prince Ning's support,

192
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,040
what else do you have?

193
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,640
But at least I still have

194
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,640
my father's military power to rely on.

195
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,320
What do you have?

196
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,720
The Duke of State has no daughters.

197
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:09,320
I was brought up by my uncle
at the age of nine

198
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,880
to become my cousin's

199
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,160
legitimate wife in the future.

200
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,520
After my cousin returned,

201
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,680
Uncle always wanted
to mend relations with him.

202
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,280
If my cousin marries me,

203
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,280
he can gain the Duke of State's
full support.

204
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,440
Is that so?

205
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,720
I know that you saved his life,

206
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,370
and he has feelings for you.

207
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:29,910
I'm willing to give up
and let you become his wife.

208
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,360
You also know

209
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,400
Xingheng may not marry
only you in the future.

210
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,440
Rather than letting those
unfamiliar women benefit,

211
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,960
let me be the bond between
the Bai family and Xingheng.

212
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,760
Trust me.

213
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,160
I will clear all obstacles
you cannot handle yourself

214
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,840
and be the perfect aid for you
to secure your position.

215
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,110
Thank you for your kind offer,

216
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,210
but I don't really need it.

217
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,480
I am not even competing with you.

218
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,600
Do you still dream of
being his one and only for life?

219
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,960
I'm not like you.

220
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,880
I don't live for others.

221
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:14,900
If he cannot meet my expectations,

222
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,000
I will find someone else.

223
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,360
Not to mention he can't do that
after ascending the throne,

224
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,280
even if he marries you now
for Prince Ning's military power,

225
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,160
he can surely marry me

226
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,080
for the Duke of State's trust.

227
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,760
(Military power.)

228
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,120
You can try.

229
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,560
See if he will marry you
for the Duke of State's support.

230
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,480
Why are you so confident?

231
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,920
It's not confidence.

232
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,320
I said if he cannot do it,

233
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,360
I will find another man.

234
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,020
Even if he is the Emperor,

235
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,680
I will leave him if necessary.

236
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:51,640
You're mad.

237
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,840
It seems you truly can't tolerate me.

238
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,600
Then let me become his wife.

239
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,920
What?

240
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,440
Chuxi.

241
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,720
Xingheng, Xingheng.

242
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,620
(Jiqing Lane)

243
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,800
Xiao Xingheng, what kind of
rotten romances are these?

244
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,480
Twisted your ankle?

245
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,720
My foot.

246
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,040
It's fine. Let's return home.

247
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,250
What a mess of romances, seriously.

248
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,840
What are you mumbling about?

249
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,480
Xiao Xingheng, you jerk.

250
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:09,570
Yes, I am a jerk.

251
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:15,160
♪Suddenly whispers softly in my ear♪

252
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,190
♪Disrupting my heartbeat♪

253
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,450
♪Longing feels just right♪

254
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:21,940
♪Surrounding you and me♪

00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,960
♪Fireworks bloom, reflected in our eyes♪

♪Make your eyes look gentle♪

♪This endless romance

260
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,270
Does it hurt here?

261
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,120
It hurts.

262
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:37,690
And here?

263
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:38,820
No.

264
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,960
It's just a dislocated ankle joint,
not fracture.

265
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:46,250
The old injury hasn't healed,
and now there's a new one.

266
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,080
It's all your fault.

267
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:56,210
I shouldn't have left you there alone.

268
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:59,160
Did Bai Queyue say something to you?

269
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,230
Your good cousin heard some rumors,

270
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,750
and thought we're going to get married.

271
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,760
Probably she wants to remove me
as an obstacle.

272
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,860
Sorry that I got in your way.

273
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:15,240
I know Bai Queyue
is on the Duke of State's side.

274
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,420
But after all, I'm a princess.

275
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:21,360
I will surely restore my dignity.

276
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,680
Don't say I'm not giving you face.

277
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,250
Rest assured, I will give you
an explanation for this.

278
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:36,620
And remember,

279
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,480
no one is more important than you.

280
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,840
Not even the Duke of State.

281
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,400
(This sounds so much like a confession.)

282
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:04,870
Be gentle.

283
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,160
It hurts.

284
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,140
