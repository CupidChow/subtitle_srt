=Episode 8=

17
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,640
Pardon my forwardness in inviting you.

18
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,250
I hope you won't take offense.

19
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,720
You're too kind, Mr. Bai.

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,640
I must thank you
for speaking up for me

21
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,800
at His Majesty's birthday banquet.

22
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,040
Princess Jielan
insulted the Crown Prince.

23
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,760
After all, I am his uncle.

24
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:53,110
How could I stand by

25
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:53,980
and watch her act out?

26
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:59,920
I thought you're not on good terms
with the Crown Prince

27
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,000
just like the rumor has it.

28
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,520
Are you trying to trap me
into saying something?

29
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,680
Your Grace, you should know

30
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,140
why our family and the Crown Prince

31
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,480
are not on good terms.

32
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,360
In fact, the Liu Kingdom

33
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,500
did not insist on taking
the Crown Prince as a hostage.

34
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,660
There was room for negotiation.

35
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,260
So why did the Duke of State
insist on sending him?

36
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,460
Because of military power.

37
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,100
What were the terms?

38
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,200
Hand over the command
of 200,000 troops

39
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,180
or send the Crown Prince as a hostage.

40
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,540
One of the two had to be chosen.

41
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,460
So the Duke of State chose the troops

42
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,980
and gave up the Crown Prince?

43
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,220
That's right.

44
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,100
Father said the family must come first.

45
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,940
My eldest sister is the Empress

46
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,300
and her children
are all legitimate heirs.

47
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,820
Any one of them

48
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,380
could be made Crown Prince.

49
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,240
I was only 13 at the time.

50
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,820
I hid in the corner of the study

51
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,870
and heard my father and sister argue.

52
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,070
Father, Xingheng is only five years old.

53
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,350
You want him to be sent
as a hostage to Liu Kingdom?

54
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:18,020
That'd be like sending him to his death!

55
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,020
You're just overly compassionate.

56
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,980
If we relinquish military power,

57
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:25,860
that would truly bring doom upon us.

58
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,580
But he is the Crown Prince!

59
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,540
He is your own grandson!

60
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,220
How could you bear it?

61
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:34,170
Muxia, you are still young.

62
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,770
You will have more children.

63
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,900
All your children
can become the Crown Prince.

64
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,020
Since that day,

65
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,900
my sister was constantly melancholy.

66
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,750
She felt guilty towards Xiao Xingheng.

67
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,660
A year before Xiao Xingheng returned,

68
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,220
my sister was pregnant again.

69
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,380
But at six months pregnant,

70
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,660
she died from excessive blood loss

71
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,100
due to premature birth.

72
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,700
The child...

73
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,420
His Majesty didn't want this child.

74
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,420
My sister also felt
that the child's birth

75
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,660
would lead the Bai family
to abandon Xiao Xingheng.

76
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,220
It was His Majesty.

77
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,700
His Majesty hadn't even acted yet.

78
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,900
It was my eldest sister.

79
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,820
That day, she overheard from Father

80
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,580
that Xiao Xingheng
was living poorly in Liu Kingdom,

81
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,020
even suffering humiliation.

82
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,260
She decided to hit her head
on the corner of a table

83
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,580
to lose the child.

84
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,580
How ironic.

85
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,460
My sister followed the rules in life.

86
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,540
She didn't dare defy Father

87
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,540
and gave up on Xiao Xingheng.

88
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,900
In the end,

89
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,100
she became brave enough
to sacrifice her life

90
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,300
to protect Xiao Xingheng.

91
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,460
(It turns out there were
so many hidden stories)

92
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,740
(behind Xiao Xingheng's
hostage years and return.)

93
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,500
Why are you telling me this?

94
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,460
At the banquet that day,

95
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,140
Xiao Xingheng signaled to me

96
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,120
to help you.

97
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,020
I knew then

98
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,790
he has special feelings for you.

99
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,860
Then you must also know

100
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,700
about Xiao Xingheng's poisoning.

101
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,780
He said it was an old ailment,

102
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,260
but didn't really hide it.

103
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,020
I guess he might have been poisoned.

104
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,020
Then do you know why he was poisoned?

105
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,700
Xiao Xingheng, he

106
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,940
has had a very difficult life
these years.

107
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,020
Can you imagine?

108
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:51,140
A five-year-old child
was constantly starving.

109
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,500
(Young Xiao Xingheng)
He was trapped in a dungeon,

110
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,340
fighting with insects and rats for food.

111
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,990
He was once Great Li's

112
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,380
Crown Prince.

113
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:05,780
Father, Mother, I don't want to leave!

114
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,180
I don't want to leave!

115
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:10,380
I will study and train harder.

116
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,140
I won't slack off anymore, Father.

117
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,740
I don't want to leave! Please!

118
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,870
He is the Crown Prince
abandoned by his homeland.

119
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,030
So thin and small.

120
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,740
He looks lowly.

121
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,420
No wonder his parents didn't love him

122
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,510
and sent him here to be a punching bag.

123
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,020
Look at him, not daring to fight back.

124
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,190
He's truly a coward.

125
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:31,820
Just looking at him makes me angry.

126
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,260
And they say he's the Crown Prince.

127
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,460
(Father,)

128
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,580
(Mother,)

129
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,420
(I'm in so much pain.)

130
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,180
(Have you truly abandoned me?)

131
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,580
(I miss you so much.)

132
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,380
(Why did you leave me?)

133
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,220
(Why?)

134
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,380
(I cannot die yet.)

135
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,340
(I must not let them triumph.)

136
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,620
(I will survive and return.)

137
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,420
(I will demand to know why.)

138
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,300
(I must survive and return.)

139
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,740
Xiao Xingheng was caught off guard

140
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,100
and forced to drink poisoned wine.

141
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:52,260
He endured excruciating pain every day.

142
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,340
(I cannot die yet.)

143
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:01,660
(I must not let them win.)

144
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,940
(I must survive and return)

145
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,980
(to ask why.)

146
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,780
What happened then?
They didn't get punished?

147
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:20,260
They were all princes
and princesses of Liu Kingdom.

148
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,740
How could we punish them?

149
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,530
But he chose another way

150
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:28,940
to return the humiliation.

151
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,900
Later, on the battlefield
in Liu Kingdom,

152
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,820
he fought instinctively

153
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,180
through mountains of corpses
and seas of blood.

154
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,220
Those were bloody and tragic scenes.

155
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,260
Every inch of his skin,

156
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,420
and every bone was torn apart,

157
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,980
mended, and torn apart again.

158
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:51,080
Repeatedly,
until the pain was unbearable.

159
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:56,260
He endured every relapse
of poisoning in solitude.

160
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,180
His eyes grew colder
and more bloodthirsty.

161
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,140
Like an Asura from hell,

162
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,490
he's determined to tear apart
all the darkness and conspiracies

163
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:07,040
of the world.

164
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,540
He captured seven cities
of the Liu Kingdom,

165
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,300
forcing them to surrender

166
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,660
and willingly become
a vassal state of Great Li,

167
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:16,460
paying tribute to us every year.

168
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:24,660
Your Highness, wake up! What's wrong?

169
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:29,840
Your Highness.
Your Highness, what's wrong?

170
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,140
Wake up.

171
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,220
It's okay, it's okay now.

172
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,620
From now on,

173
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,620
as long as I'm Great Li's Crown Prince,

174
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,060
those people will have to bow before me.

175
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:40,540
He completed his revenge in his own way.

176
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,700
He is a person of extraordinary talent,

177
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:46,840
whether as a general

178
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,860
or as a Crown Prince.

179
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,580
So

180
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:55,790
he indeed has a strained relationship
with our family.

181
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,140
But as his uncle,

182
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,220
I'm on good terms with him.

183
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,500
(I noticed before)

184
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:25,100
(that Xiao Xingheng likes sweet things.)

185
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,500
(Is it because his past was so bitter)

186
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,580
(that he now craves sweetness?)

187
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:40,540
Over the years, Xiao Xingheng

188
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,380
has endured too much hardship.

189
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,780
As his uncle, no matter
how much I try to make amends,

190
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,940
I cannot give him back

191
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,970
the vibrant youth he deserved.

192
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,360
But I can see

193
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:51,020
he treats you differently.

194
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:58,490
I hope you can make the rest of his life

195
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,540
a bit sweeter.

196
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:13,980
It's for you.

197
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,300
For me?

198
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:19,770
Yes.

199
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,660
I passed Jiqing Workshop on my way here,

200
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,980
and heard some vendors shouting,

201
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,640
so I bought one on a whim.

202
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,140
It's very sweet. Thank you.

203
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:03,100
I really like it.

204
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,350
But why did you suddenly give me a gift?

205
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,740
(I couldn't say)

206
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:17,220
(I heard your tragic story
from your uncle)

207
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,020
(and felt sympathy for you.)

208
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:23,340
You were just staring at me in a daze,

209
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,640
as if you wanted to devour me alive
with that gaze.

210
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:31,220
And now you're giving me
such a thoughtful gift.

211
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,020
Could it be that

212
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:36,460
you have feelings for me?

213
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,580
(Register)

214
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:44,020
You're reading too much into it.

215
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,020
You just said I looked handsome,

216
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,100
and now you say I read too much into it.

217
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:55,210
Could it be that my appearance
has now withered

218
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:56,420
and no longer pleases you?

219
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:01,610
You're gentle and refined,

220
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,820
with a noble bearing.

221
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,900
So that's how I look in your eyes.

222
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,730
Alright, enough teasing.

223
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,200
Don't forget about the banquet
the day after tomorrow.

224
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,060
What?

225
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,980
Did you promise His Majesty
to host some farewell party?

226
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,090
Are you well enough?

227
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,750
I've been sick for too long.

228
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,670
It's time to recover.

229
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:34,700
(Otherwise, the ministers
might soon forget)

230
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,540
(Great Li still has a Crown Prince.)

231
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:41,010
(Xingchen Palace)
Remember to come early tomorrow.

232
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:42,670
Why should I come early?

233
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,580
Just come.

234
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,180
Don't forget.

235
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,140
