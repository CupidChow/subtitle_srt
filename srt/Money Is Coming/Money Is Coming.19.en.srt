00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:12,060
=Money is Coming=

2
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,860
=Episode 19=

3
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:16,600
Have all the people
in Yuchang Pavilion been dealt with?

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,920
Fortunately,Her Grace's maid

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,480
sealed Yuchang Pavilion at the time,

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,720
not allowing anyone in or out.

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,600
Currently, all who know

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,160
Her Grace was abducted

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,400
have all signed their names

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,240
and been registered.

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,640
Eliminate everyone around Lin Yudai

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,720
who're involved in this.

13
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,480
Make sure you handle this cleanly.

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,280
Yes, we'll not let anyone

15
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,560
involved in this go.

16
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,080
What about Lin Yudai?

17
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:48,920
Perhaps

18
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,480
she'd prefer to handle this herself.

19
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,120
Feed her the paralysis powder

20
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,540
and lock her in the dungeon.

21
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,600
Yes.

22
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,720
As for you,

23
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,990
go to the torture room
to receive your punishment.

24
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,960
It was my dereliction of duty.

25
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,200
I'll go to the torture room right away.

26
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:33,200
What have you done?

27
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,720
Why do you end up in here?

28
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,080
Negligence of duty.

29
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:40,700
I nearly made a big mistake.

30
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,710
You know,

31
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:49,760
I never show mercy
when carrying out punishment,

32
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,590
unless...

33
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,920
Enough nonsense.

34
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,480
(This fool.)

35
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,520
I have to say

36
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,280
you deserved this beating.

37
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,400
It was entirely justified.

38
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,720
Although

39
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,450
you act more reliably than I do,

40
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,380
you only have Xiao Xingheng
in your eyes.

41
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,820
You know well
he treats Princess Yuexi differently,

42
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,400
but you didn't
take this matter seriously.

43
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,240
This hundred lashes
were truly without leniency.

44
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,760
Since you've taken the punishment,

45
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,720
don't make the same mistake again.

46
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,520
Does it hurt?

47
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,240
It's fine.

48
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,360
Master.

49
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,070
Ning Chuxi has never
been my subordinate.

50
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,720
I hope you can respect her

51
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,520
and protect her

52
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,440
wholeheartedly.

53
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,000
What do you want to do with Lin Yudai?

54
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,560
I want to kill her.

55
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,440
The two people who abducted me are gone.

56
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:20,680
No one can testify for me.

57
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,800
Why didn't I think of keeping one?

58
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,910
I wonder if there's still any evidence

59
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,200
to prove it was her doing.

60
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,280
If we report this to the authorities,

61
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,080
won't everyone know about my abduction?

62
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,400
I don't care about my reputation,

63
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,920
but I can't let her have her way.

64
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,880
If I can't do it aboveboard,

65
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,520
then assassinate her.

66
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,290
I don't know if the troops left

67
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:42,500
are enough.

68
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,640
If Xiao Xu catches even a slight trace,

69
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,280
my old man is still on the front lines.

70
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,310
If we kill her now,

71
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,630
it will provoke Xiao Xu to retaliate.

72
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,680
Wouldn't that cause trouble
for my old man?

73
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,960
Hey, I'm seriously thinking of a plan.

74
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,680
You're not helping, and you're laughing?

75
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,400
Actually, it's not that complicated.

76
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,080
If you want to take her life,

77
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,950
I'll have Huailiu
and the others handle it.

78
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,680
Even if Xiao Xu suspects,

79
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,120
there will be no evidence left.

80
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,300
I'm just afraid Xiao Xu
will go mad and attack you.

81
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,750
(He's the male lead in the book.)

82
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,660
(I should be cautious)

83
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,250
(lest he causes trouble
for Xiao Xingheng.)

84
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,600
I'm fine,

85
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,800
and I don't fear life or death.

86
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,400
Xiao Xingheng, I'll say it only once.

87
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,880
Since I've agreed to marry you,

88
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,720
you are already mine.

89
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,120
Without my permission,

90
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,120
you must not be harmed in any way.

91
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,720
If I say no, it's a no.

92
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:41,920
Do you hear me?

93
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:45,380
I do. I'm yours.

94
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,280
And also,

95
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,030
I'll handle the grudge

96
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,840
between Lin Yudai and me.

97
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,250
You're not allowed to interfere.

98
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,690
Suddenly I don't feel like killing her.

99
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,080
Alright.

100
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:07,000
The most painful thing
isn't physical torture

101
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:08,880
but mental destruction.

102
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,160
The more she desires something,

103
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,250
I'll make her lose it

104
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,520
just when she's about

105
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:15,490
to succeed.

106
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,160
What does Lin Yudai care about the most?

107
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,240
Her relationship with Xiao Xu,

108
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,960
a high status to mask her inferiority

109
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,080
and her reputation
as a refined and talented lady.

110
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,480
Then let what she cares about

111
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,240
be destroyed one by one.

112
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,040
If she dies now,

113
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:37,280
Xiao Xu will remember her forever.

114
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,200
I'll make her turn against Xiao Xu,

115
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,840
fall into dust just as she rises high,

116
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:47,120
and become infamous
and shamed to be mentioned.

117
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,600
Whatever you say.

118
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,400
Don't you think

119
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,800
we're like the scheming villains

120
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,840
in a storybook?

121
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,120
Nonsense, I think we are like

122
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,440
the perfectly matched protagonists
defeating villains in a storybook.

123
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,600
Then don't you think I'm vicious?

124
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,440
No.

125
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,730
I think you're adorable.

126
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:21,000
The famous talented lady, Lin Yudai,
mysteriously disappeared.

127
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:24,220
Is it the return of a philanderer

128
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:26,800
or a young lady eloping for love?

129
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,360
Is it the distortion of human nature

130
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,300
- or the collapse of morality?
- The collapse of morality.

131
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,880
Ning, you're such a sensationalist.

132
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,040
I should let you write my books.

133
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,200
Stop being glib, can you do it or not?

134
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,610
I'll surely do what you told me.

135
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,400
Breaking news! Miss Lin Yudai
has mysteriously disappeared.

136
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:53,960
Here you go.

137
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,980
Is it the distortion of human nature

138
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,560
or the collapse of morality?

139
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,280
Breaking news!

140
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,120
Come on.

141
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,440
Breaking news!

142
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,510
Capital Daily, daily updates!

143
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,900
Breaking news!

144
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,680
I heard there was a big thief
causing trouble a few days ago.

145
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,920
If you ask me,

146
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,320
Miss Lin must have been taken
by a philanderer.

147
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,840
Such a pity for this young lady.

148
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,320
But I heard

149
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,920
she defied her father

150
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,160
and eloped with someone.

151
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,240
That's quite possible.

152
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,920
It was rumored before that
Miss Lin had someone in her heart.

153
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,270
And besides, this is the capital.

154
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:53,100
Who would dare abduct someone
under the Emperor's nose?

155
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,800
- Right.
- Exactly.

156
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,040
(Two days later)

157
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,200
Is this a person?

158
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,040
What is this?

159
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,040
It's moving.

160
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,160
Who is this? Why lying here?

161
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,400
- It's a person.
- It's a girl.

162
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,680
It's a young lady.

163
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,280
Whose daughter is this?

164
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,800
Isn't this Miss Lin?

165
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,320
Lin Yudai? What happened to her?

166
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,640
She must have lost her innocence.

167
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,620
I didn't.

168
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,420
I didn't.

169
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:33,140
What are you looking at?
Get out of here!

170
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:36,220
Get lost, all of you!

171
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,680
- She always wants to be the spotlight.
- Get lost!

172
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,900
- Get lost!
- Whether her reputation soars

173
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,380
or plummets,

174
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,060
she's now become
the center of attention.

175
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,840
Notify Xiao Xu to come and get her.

176
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,000
Xu.

177
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,960
Yudai, where have you been these days?

178
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,950
There's full of rumors about you...

179
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,980
Xu, I didn't.

180
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,980
Those rumors outside are not true.

181
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,260
I really didn't.

182
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,900
Alright, don't cry.

183
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,860
Since you say the rumors are all false,

184
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:03,860
then tell me what exactly
happened these days.

185
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,980
(I can't possibly tell him)

186
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:09,580
(that I kidnapped Ning Chuxi
and then got taken to the dungeon.)

187
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,540
It's fine if you don't want to say it.

188
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,260
Xu, I really didn't.

189
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,380
I don't remember anything anymore.

190
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,820
But I know my own body.

191
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,860
I didn't do anything to betray you.

192
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,300
And moreover, Xu,

193
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:32,460
I've only loved you
from beginning to end.

194
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,300
How could I possibly
elope with someone else?

195
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,680
Alright, stop crying.

196
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,060
Then who abducted you?

197
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,100
Is there anyone you suspect?

198
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,380
Never mind.

199
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:56,550
Yudai, these are troubled times.

200
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,260
I've taken a big risk

201
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,700
keeping you here today.

202
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,140
Yudai, you're aware

203
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:03,250
that dignity is what matters most
to the royal family.

204
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,690
If someone uses this to their advantage,

205
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,800
it could be very detrimental to me.

206
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,140
Forget it.

207
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:31,290
Perhaps this is our fate.

208
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,160
Yudai.

209
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:56,010
Let's drink the last cup of wine.

210
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:37,020
(Xu, I'm doing this
because I love you too much.)

211
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,340
Xu.

212
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,100
Xu.

213
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,300
Aunt, what is it?

214
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,420
You said you had something
to discuss with me.

215
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:05,020
We've been sitting here for a while.

216
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,920
What is it

217
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,960
that's so hard to say?

218
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:11,430
Aunt,

219
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,930
I... I want...

220
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,420
I want to ask you to request
an imperial decree from Father

221
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,820
to arrange a marriage for me.

222
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,100
What? You've changed your mind

223
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,870
and want to marry Princess Yuexi?

224
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,540
No, it's not Ning Chuxi.

225
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,380
Not Ning Chuxi?

226
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,940
Then who is it?

227
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,980
Is it Lin Yudai?

228
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,860
Did she bewitch you

229
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,340
so that you're so devoted to her?

230
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:45,740
Aunt, we're already
consummated the marriage.

231
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,380
What?

232
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,580
So I must marry her.

233
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,420
You really aren't picky.

234
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,900
You can sleep with just anyone,
can't you?

235
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,040
Lin Yudai is just
a concubine's daughter.

236
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,710
Now she's become so unpresentable.

237
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,300
How could you possibly do that?

238
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,220
Don't even think about marrying her.

239
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:09,790
Not only do I disagree,

240
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,900
if your father finds out,

241
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:16,470
you'll never have a chance
at that position.

242
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:24,020
But Aunt, if I don't marry her,

243
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:27,060
she might retaliate, and I'm afraid...

244
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:27,980
Speaking of which,

245
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,700
I want to ask you.

246
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:32,660
Knowing her character is flawed

247
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:35,370
and she can't possibly
enter the royal family,

248
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,450
why did you sleep with her?

249
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:41,780
Or have you two been
sharing a bed all along?

250
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,140
Aunt,

251
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,140
I was bewitched.

252
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,780
Now the die is cast,

253
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,900
I must take responsibility.

254
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,020
She was expelled from the Lin family

255
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,220
because of this,

256
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:02,940
and I can't bear to see her
on the streets.

257
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:06,340
Didn't you say she loves you so much
that she can't live without you?

258
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,100
Why care about titles then?

259
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,180
With her flawed character

260
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,500
and malicious intentions,

261
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,860
being a concubine
would be an honor for her.

262
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,800
She even dares to dream
of becoming a legitimate wife.

263
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,060
What is she, really?

264
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,620
I give you one day to sort this out.

265
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:23,090
If it reaches your father,

266
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,340
I can't even help you.

267
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,700
I understand.

268
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:41,420
Yudai, I've been busy lately,

269
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:44,430
so let's not meet for now.

270
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,720
She's the lady who disappeared for days,

271
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,740
then was found half-naked

272
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,640
on the streets.

273
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,380
She's lost her innocence.

274
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,300
How dare she come to find
the Third Prince now?

275
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,660
Look at what she's become.

276
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,260
She still dreams
of rising to prominence.

277
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,220
She was overconfident.

278
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,940
Miss, are you alright?

279
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,100
Trying to outshine Princess Yuexi.

280
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,900
She's just a common-born daughter,

281
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:37,140
yet dared to challenge the princess
for the Third Prince's favor.

282
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,980
Where did she get the courage?

283
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:42,300
Favor? The Third Prince
is avoiding her now,

284
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,420
can't get away fast enough.

285
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,460
She still fancies she's
the top talent in the capital.

286
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:48,220
- Miss.
- This is karma, karma!

287
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,140
Xiao Xu was tricked,

288
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,340
swallowed a bitter bill in silence

289
00:18:58,650 --> 00:18:59,580
and suffered this karma.

290
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,580
Are you satisfied with this outcome?

291
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,380
Maybe.

292
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,860
But in my opinion, it's not enough.

293
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,180
I've seen her rise

294
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,380
and fall.

295
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,740
It's quite dramatic.

296
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,730
Everyone should pay for their choices,

297
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,450
and this is what she chose.

298
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,660
