1
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,840
(Legends say, in ancient tales,)

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
(whenever the male and female leads
are about to fall in love,)

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,800
(an arrogant and villainous woman)

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,200
(always appears to interrupt them.)

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,920
(The original host asked the Emperor
to arrange her marriage at 14.)

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,040
(Three years later, the Crown Prince
passed away due to illness)

7
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,990
(and Xiao Xu got the chance
to ascend the throne.)

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,120
(For his daughter, Prince Ning)

9
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,600
(strongly supported Xiao Xu
to take the throne.)

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,360
(After Xiao Xu
became the Crown Prince,)

11
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,760
(he immediately planned
to take Lin Yudai as a concubine.)

12
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,040
(The original host
was extremely resentful,)

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,080
(creating a big scene.)

14
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,400
I've seen enough of these dramas.

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,560
Why can't you tolerate me?

16
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,400
Ignore her.

17
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,560
(Failing to threaten him with her life,
she tried poisoning herself)

18
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,960
(but ended up drinking real poison)

19
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,000
(and died.)

20
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,200
I'm an ordinary female college student

21
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,640
who transmigrated into the book
as the villainous Ning Chuxi.

22
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,360
Since fate made me beautiful,

23
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,080
wealthy, and powerful,

24
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,040
why should I seek death?

25
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,760
Even if I transmigrated
as a hopeless romantic,

26
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,720
I will still change my fate.

27
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,080
Since it all started from the marriage,

28
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:01,920
then I'll cancel the engagement.

29
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,890
(Old Residence in Yizhou)
I'll hide in Yizhou

30
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,600
until I survive to the very end.

31
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,840
Maybe I can win easily this way.

32
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,560
Riches and glory, here I come!

33
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,760
=Money is Coming=

34
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,320
Don't say I didn't warn you.

35
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,760
I'm going to win big time.

36
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,400
Pung. Chuxi,
you've been winning all day.

37
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,640
Let me win a round.

38
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,930
(The 886th round)
If I lose this round,

39
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,700
I'll go vegetarian for a month.
South Wind.

40
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:22,840
White Board.
You've been saying this for a year.

41
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,000
Four Bams.

42
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,120
Three Dots.

43
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,520
Pung.

44
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,140
(Old Residence in Yizhou)
By the way, Chuxi,

45
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,320
you're almost at marriageable age.

46
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,000
You can't just stay single.

47
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,610
(Third Aunt)
I have a nephew.

48
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,460
Pung.

49
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,720
What? Your nephew is also single?

50
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,760
(Ning Chuxi, Princess Yuexi)
That's not right.

51
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:41,840
You're the only daughter in this house.

52
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,800
Your marriage is a big deal.

53
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,880
(Second Aunt)
Do you have any men you like?

54
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,040
White Board.

55
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,480
I don't have a man I like,

56
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,480
but there's a woman I like.

57
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:56,280
Second Aunt,
I think you're quite attractive.

58
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,280
Naughty girl.

59
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,080
I heard

60
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,280
the Third Prince is about
to select a consort.

61
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,320
I've heard about it too.

62
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,380
The Emperor is arranging marriages
for him and the Crown Prince.

63
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,040
All the noble ladies in the capital...

64
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:08,880
Wait a minute.

65
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,180
Isn't the Crown Prince dead yet?

66
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,620
Shh.

67
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,880
My good girl,

68
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,450
(Madame Ning)
trouble comes from the mouth.

69
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,040
Yes, yes.

70
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,040
Eight Dots.

71
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,240
All of one suit.

72
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,640
I won! Pay up, pay up!

73
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,360
You brat won again.

74
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,650
I'm destined to win.

75
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,130
I'm done playing.

76
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,080
Aunties, come back tomorrow.

77
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,280
Clever girl.

78
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,560
What a quick tongue.

79
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,480
Grandma, look.

80
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,150
You've won so much money. Great!

81
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,940
(Righteous Demeanor)

82
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,240
(In the original story,)

83
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,360
(the Crown Prince is supposed
to die of illness this year.)

84
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,880
(The male lead will become
the Crown Prince next year)

85
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,320
(with Prince Ning's support.)

86
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,520
(Shortly after that,)

87
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,600
(the original host)

88
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,240
(poisoned herself to death.)

89
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,000
How pathetic.

90
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,840
(Though I haven't been engaged
to the male lead,)

91
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,600
(and Prince Ning haven't
supported him like in the story,)

92
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,600
(if I'm outshone by the female lead,)

93
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,080
(things might still
follow the storyline.)

94
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,720
(If I don't go back to the capital
and do something,)

95
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,880
(I'll be forced into marriage again...)

96
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,400
(Mei, Maid)
Miss, do you still like him?

97
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,040
No, before Father supports Xiao Xu,

98
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,680
and before Xiao Xu
becomes the Crown Prince,

99
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,680
there's still time to change everything.

100
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,880
I must return to the capital.

101
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,040
I'm going back to the capital.

102
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,440
I'm going back to the capital.

103
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,360
Miss,

104
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,760
if you want to cry, just let it out.

105
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,400
When people are sad,

106
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,000
they don't need a psychologist.

107
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,040
They just need

108
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,000
a fortune teller.

109
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,200
Pack my bags
and let's head back to the capital

110
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,240
by starlight.

111
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,640
We should've waited for His Highness
to send someone to pick us up.

112
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,200
Calm down. Have you forgotten
what I taught you?

113
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:17,000
We're going to amaze everyone.

114
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,000
Louder.

115
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:25,880
We're going to amaze everyone.

116
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,120
Right, it's just motion sickness.

117
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,280
I'm fine.

118
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,440
Yeah, I'm fine.

119
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,360
(Dumping the body?)

120
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:55,380
(Huailiu, Crown Prince's bodyguard)

121
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,080
(They can't be able to see me
in the darkness.)

122
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,720
(Another one.)

123
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,640
Master.

124
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:13,180
(Xiao Xingheng, Crown Prince)

125
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,880
(Oh no, they're not going
to silence me, are they?)

126
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,280
(This person is very dangerous.)

127
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,800
Let's go.

128
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,760
(Goodness, I ran into a crime scene.)

129
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:14,530
Want to take a look?

130
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,880
(Judging by his demeanor,)

131
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,680
(he must be from
an extraordinary family.)

132
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,360
(I've never seen such a person
in Yizhou.)

133
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,920
(He's most likely from
a noble family in the capital.)

134
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,120
(But which young master)

135
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,960
(can kill someone so quietly?)

136
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,600
(Luckily, he doesn't seem
to want to silence me.)

137
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,320
(I don't know what will happen
when we reach the capital.)

138
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,480
Forget it, there may be more trouble.

139
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,400
The male and female leads
are still waiting for me, right?

140
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,480
Master, who was that woman just now?

141
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,440
That woman clearly saw us.

142
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,880
If she were from an ordinary family,

143
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,280
eliminating her would be effortless.

144
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,160
Why did you let her go?

145
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,280
Did you see the cloak she was wearing?

146
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,080
Cloak?

147
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,360
It's a white mink cloak, right?

148
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:10,220
(Bai Luoqiu, Heir to the Duke of State)

149
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,640
The white mink cloak
on the woman is pure white,

150
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,160
without a trace of other color.

151
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,280
Although Yizhou is wealthy,

152
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,320
such a high-quality white mink cloak

153
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,320
is still rare to see.

154
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,160
Perhaps only she can wear

155
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,320
this cloak in Yizhou.

156
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,160
If it's her,

157
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,720
it'd be a hassle to hurt her.

158
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,280
Who exactly are you talking about?

159
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,980
The legitimate daughter of Prince Ning,

160
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,920
Princess Yuexi.

161
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,480
The only prince with
a different surname in Li Dynasty,

162
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:48,160
commanding 300,000 soldiers
guarding the northern frontier?

163
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,160
He treasures his daughter very much.

164
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,280
Is her that woman just now?

165
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,240
Even if there is a 1 in 10,000 chance,

166
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,920
we cannot harm her.

167
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,880
She's not only Prince Ning's
legitimate daughter,

168
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,200
but also his only heir.

169
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,360
Then keep her.

170
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,360
Let her trouble someone else.

171
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,320
I heard Princess Yuexi
almost married Xiao Xu.

172
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,800
Why she had to call off the marriage
and hide here in Yizhou?

173
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,840
She's not coming back
to get married, is she?

174
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,880
There's going to be trouble.

175
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,760
That makes it more interesting.

176
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,240
Miss, we're arrived
at Prince Ning's Residence.

177
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:47,740
(Prince Ning's Residence)

178
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,080
(It's been just three years,)

179
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,360
(but I'm not the original host.)

180
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,000
(Hopefully he won't find out)

181
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,440
(I'm not his real daughter.)

182
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,160
Chuxi.

183
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,600
(Previous life)
I'm taking my daughter home!

184
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,520
His Majesty has ordered
to kill Prince Ning without mercy.

185
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,680
(Ning Hao, Prince Ning)
Chuxi, you're back.

186
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,720
(Prince Ning, you really are
the best father in the world.)

187
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,840
(From today, you are my father too.)

188
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:14,320
It's good that you're back.

189
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,120
Father, I'm doing well.

190
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,800
(Oops, I called him wrong.)

191
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,000
Old man, I'm doing well.

192
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,400
Good, good child.

193
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,240
Good to have you back.
Let's go home.

194
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,240
Yeah.

195
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,420
(Prince Ning's Residence)

196
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,760
Old man, you looked mighty
three years ago.

197
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,280
But now, tsk tsk.

198
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,080
With a huge belly, you're just greasy.

199
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,040
I'm greasy? Where am I greasy?

200
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,520
Shh, twist a bit more.

201
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,320
Remember to do

202
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,080
this exercise every day.

203
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:11,900
(Lingshan Shrine)

204
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,400
Seeing your looks,

205
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,160
(Master Huiku)
the destined person must have appeared.

206
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,400
Several years ago when you
mentioned the destined person,

207
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,320
I thought I might not

208
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,000
live to see her.

209
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,880
Your Highness is favored by fortune.

210
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,960
Ignoring my idle words wouldn't matter.

211
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,400
But you have a calamity
destined for you.

212
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,960
This destined person will have
many entanglements with you

213
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,520
and also help you
avert this deadly calamity.

214
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,960
I never entrust my life to others,

215
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,560
and others are not obliged
to save me from calamity.

216
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,600
I don't believe in fate.

217
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,360
I only believe in myself.

218
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,720
No, it's not an obligation.

219
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,640
But this person
has a destiny with you.

220
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,960
Fate is something unpredictable.

221
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,720
I might not even live
to meet this person.

222
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,840
The tea here is still so bitter.

223
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,000
Sorry to trouble you, Master.

224
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:37,640
(Acquaintances are bound by fate.)

225
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,560
I wish for a wealthy

226
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,560
and honorable life.

227
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,180
(Original Intention)

228
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,400
Ning,

229
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,320
long time no see.

230
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,160
(Lin Yudai, original female lead)
Greetings, Sister Ning.

231
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,040
(Previous life)
Soon will be my and Xu's wedding.

232
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,240
Please review
these wedding invitations.

233
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,800
Shameless!
You didn't love each other before,

234
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,040
yet you fell for him
just as I was marrying him.

235
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,000
Do you take me for a fool?

236
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,040
How are you not the fool?

237
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,760
Do you want to know

238
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,440
what your husband
says to me every night?

239
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,360
He says you're extremely vicious.

240
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,880
He says you cling to him shamelessly.

241
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,600
And also,

242
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,040
the unloved one is

243
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,120
the slut.

244
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,120
(I just arrived in the capital
and bumped into the female lead.)

245
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,720
Miss Lin, you're too polite.

246
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,840
I'm the only princess
in Prince Ning's Residence.

247
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,440
I don't have any sisters.

248
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,520
Miss Lin, just call me Princess.

249
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,000
(So pretentious.)

250
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,880
It's my fault.
Please forgive me, Princess.

251
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,720
I believe you'll be staying here
for a long time.

252
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,480
His Highness must have found you
an ideal husband.

253
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,880
I wonder who's the lucky young man.

254
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,280
Marriage is arranged by parents.

255
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,840
I'm not like you,

256
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,520
interested in other people's husband.

257
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,760
I wonder if Mr. Lin

258
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,800
has found a suitable husband for you.

259
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,400
It's my fault.

260
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,520
I was just worried about you.

261
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,560
But I shouldn't have
discussed your marriage.

262
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,480
Good that you know.

263
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:40,410
You...

264
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:41,720
Miss Lin is just concerned about you.

265
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,080
Instead of appreciating it,

266
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,320
you even blamed her.

267
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,960
Is it a big deal that you're a princess?

268
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,440
Why are you so aggressive?

269
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,520
Did you hear that?

270
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,440
You must apologize to Miss Lin today.

271
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,040
Master, this is...

272
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,680
Go.

273
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,440
How dare a servant
be rude to the princess?

274
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,040
This maid from Prince Ning's Residence

275
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,080
is quite brave.

276
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,760
I was being abrupt, but what wrong
did Hongniang do?

277
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,990
As soon as Ning Chuxi
returns to the capital,

278
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,920
she causes trouble even
in Lingshan Shrine.

279
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,000
If this news gets out,

280
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,680
I think Noble Consort Sun

281
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,280
would not have
a good impression of her.

282
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,480
Prince Ning's selection
of his son-in-law won't go smoothly.

283
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,360
Go ahead, take care of it.

284
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,360
Yes.

285
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,880
(Why does this person look so familiar?)

286
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,440
She shouted at a princess

287
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,960
and you don't know
what wrong did she do?

288
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,640
Her Grace is already showing mercy

289
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,280
since she hasn't sent her
to the government office.

290
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,120
If you have any objections,

291
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,480
it's better to send her
to the government office

292
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,440
and let the chief magistrate examine her.

293
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,600
(If my maid is sent
to the government office,)

294
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,360
(no matter the reason,)

295
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,440
(my reputation will be damaged.)

296
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,600
(I can't go crazy with Ning Chuxi.)

297
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,440
It's Hongniang's fault.

298
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,360
She was just trying to protect me.

299
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,600
I hope you will forgive her.

300
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,640
Your maid is ill-behaved

301
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,560
but quite loyal.

302
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,160
I hope you will properly
train your servants when you return.

303
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,880
Otherwise, next time,

304
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,960
it won't be as simple as a slap.

305
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,800
Come on, thank Her Grace.

306
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,080
Thank you, Your Grace.

307
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,560
Miss, they are always

308
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,160
crying and complaining,

309
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,360
acting like you've bullied them.

310
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,480
Today, we finally got to enjoy it a bit.

311
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,480
You're impressive.

312
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,520
It's not that impressive.

313
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,680
I just bullied them back this time.

314
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,440
