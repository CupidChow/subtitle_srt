=Episode 17=

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,760
Miss, I've brought the nanny.

4
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,520
Nanny, you must take a close look.

5
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,960
Don't end up suspecting me
of harboring an assassin.

6
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,480
I cannot bear such a charge.

7
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,920
You're joking, Your Grace.

8
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,810
Nanny, have you thoroughly checked?

9
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,120
Is there an assassin hiding in my hall?

10
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,680
Your Grace,

11
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,200
I've finished checking.

12
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,080
There's no one hiding here.

13
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:42,560
Then hurry out
and report to your master.

14
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,080
Don't irritate me here.

15
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,840
Yes.

16
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,200
Bring me my change of clothes later.

17
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,080
These people have made me

18
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,800
lose interest in bathing.

19
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,600
Yes.

20
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,440
How is it?

21
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,400
Your Highness,

22
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,720
I carefully checked
both the outer and inner halls.

23
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,720
There is no one else there,

24
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,480
only Her Grace.

25
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,600
Rest assured, Your Highness.

26
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,640
Her Grace is perfectly fine.

27
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,320
Now you don't need to worry
about my daughter's safety

28
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,040
or suspect her of harboring an assassin.

29
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,640
Are you reassured now?

30
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,440
Sorry to bother you, Prince Ning.

31
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,840
Xiao Xingheng.

32
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,280
Xiao Xingheng.

33
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,360
Xiao Xingheng.

34
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,080
Xiao Xingheng.

35
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,920
Xiao Xingheng.

36
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:58,480
Xiao Xingheng.

37
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,400
Your Grace.

38
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,370
Are you okay?

39
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,360
I'm fine now.

40
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,670
Since you're fine

41
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,200
and the people outside are gone,

42
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,480
why are you still not leaving?

43
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,360
Are you staying to watch me change?

44
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,760
That sounds good.

45
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,760
Previously, you saved my life

46
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,720
and now you helped me
escape a deadly calamity.

47
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,960
I really don't know how to repay you.

48
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,920
How about

49
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,480
I give myself to you?

50
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,000

Xiao Xingheng,
I don't like guessing games,

doubting and regretting
after decisions are made

79
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,120
and hesitating over choices.

80
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,880
I am different from other women.

81
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,840
I'm not shy to speak my mind.

82
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:30,800
At this moment,
I just want to know your answer.

83
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,240

and almost ruined
Her Grace's reputation.

110
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,050
How come I was not informed of this?

111
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,680
Fine, I won't beat around the bush.

112
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,150
What are your thoughts

113
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,320
on your daughter's marriage?

114
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,680
It depends on Chuxi's preferences.

115
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,360
But if you ask for my thoughts,

116
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,320
I would hope for Chuxi

117
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,550
to marry into an ordinary
wealthy family.

118
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:12,540
It doesn't matter
if they have a lower status.

119
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,560
This way, I can protect her.

120
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,980
Your love for your daughter
is truly touching.

121
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:25,780
Princess Yuexi is graceful and charming.

122
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,560
I am quite fond of her.

123
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,750
I wonder if any of my sons

124
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,550
catch her fancy.

125
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,280
If any of the princes favor Chuxi,

126
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,410
that would be her blessing.

127
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,220
What do you think of the Third Prince?

128
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:43,540
The Third Prince is talented
in both literature and martial arts.

129
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:47,040
But somehow,

130
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,360
he doesn't seem to get along with Chuxi.

131
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,680
What about the Crown Prince?

132
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,830
The Crown Prince is elegant and noble.

133
00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:00,320
But... But...

134
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,650
Speak your mind.

135
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:08,980
What I say may offend Your Majesty.

136
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,720
I beg your forgiveness.

137
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,440
Last time, Chuxi accidentally

138
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,880
took an arrow for the Crown Prince.

139
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,080
She didn't say it,

140
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,360
but I know

141
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,440
my daughter is fond of His Highness.

142
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:24,100
But His Highness

143
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,560
has always been frail.

144
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,400
I am worried

145
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:33,600
my daughter will be left alone
in the future.

146
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,080
Please forgive me for my offence.

147
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:40,130
(It seems Princess Yuexi
likes the Crown Prince,)

148
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:42,960
(but the old fox is worried)

149
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:44,820
(he's susceptible to early death.)

150
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,850
Do you think Father will approve

151
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,300
the Crown Prince
and Ning Chuxi's marriage?

152
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,480
We cannot be sure

153
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,550
whether the Duke of State
is truly against the Crown Prince

154
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,560
or it is just a facade

155
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,930
in Father's eyes.

156
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,900
But it's a fact that
the Crown Prince is currently weak.

157
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,040
Prince Ning guards the northern borders

158
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,400
and the Duke of State

159
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,620
guards the western regions.

160
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:05,200
If Princess Yuexi
marries the Crown Prince,

161
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,400
he can use the Crown Prince
to control Prince Ning.

162
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,560
He needs a counterbalance.

163
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,280
Prince Ning,

164
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,300
you're merely fulfilling
your duty as a father.

165
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,090
That's not an offence.

166
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,250
Thank you, Your Majesty,
for your understanding.

167
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,640
I only spoke my thoughts.

168
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,840
But if Your Majesty chooses for Chuxi,

169
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,320
no matter who it is,

170
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,240
it would be the highest honor
for our Ning family.

171
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,360
(This old fox has likely knew)

172
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,640
(I dare not casually
arrange this marriage.)

173
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,480
(Today's chess game was for naught.)

174
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,030
So, have you two already...

175
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,960
There's nothing between us.

176
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,960
But Yunquan Palace
is not a private residence.

177
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,520
The more people, the more eyes.

178
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,840
Since the Third Prince
knew you were here,

179
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,630
why did he act as if he must barge in?

180
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,520
Could it be

181
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,480
he wanted to ruin your reputation

182
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,640
and reap the benefits?

183
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,760
I knew my best friend is smart.

184
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,680
Let's do this.

185
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,120
Going this big?

186
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:44,860
The bigger the waves,
the fatter the fish.

187
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:49,110
Why I've never heard of this?

188
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,710
Breaking news! Breaking news!

189
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,190
"Tales of the Noble Circle"
has an explosive update.

190
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,930
Everyone, come take a look!

191
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:58,470
Breaking news! Breaking news!

192
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:01,340
"Tales of the Noble Circle"
has an explosive update.

193
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:03,100
Come and see!

194
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,570
Breaking news! Breaking news!

195
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,020
Here you are.

196
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,110
Miss, you're truly amazing.

197
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,840
The rumors are spiraling out of control.

198
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:21,080
Now all sorts of things are being said.

199
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,250
What are they saying?

200
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,100
Here's the thing.

201
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,980
Today Miss Su released her new book.

202
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:30,440
She wrote a grand total
of hundreds of thousands of words,

203
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,280
analyzing the hidden secrets and stories

204
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,720
- of the noble circle in the capital.
- Exactly.

205
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,160
Now those people

206
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,690
are almost all implicated.

207
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,230
(Now,)

208
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:42,680
(I guess some people
are going to lose their cool.)

209
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,720
Chuxi, have you recovered?

210
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,300
Thank you for your concern,
Your Highness.

211
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,000
I've fully recovered.

212
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,600
You're turning 18 soon, right?

213
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,400
It's time to discuss marriage.

214
00:15:56,650 --> 00:16:00,170
Do you have anyone in mind
for a husband?

215
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,120
I already have someone I admire.

216
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,050
But I'm too shy to tell you.

217
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,920
My father has already agreed
after knowing.

218
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:18,840
I wonder who has won your favor?

219
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,160
Don't ask, Your Highness.

220
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:25,360
Chuxi, as a lady,
you should choose carefully.

221
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,710
It never hurts to look more.

222
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:31,120
And Xu isn't bad either.

223
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,600
Chuxi, think about it carefully.

224
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:36,950
Your Highness, don't you know?

225
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:39,800
Know what?

226
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:46,430
Everyone says they have already

227
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,280
pledged to marry privately.

228
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,760
That's not true.

229
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,840
Chuxi, where did you hear that?

230
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,430
This is what all the ladies
outside are saying.

231
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,520
Chuxi,

232
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,440
don't listen to the nonsense outside.

233
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,840
Lin Yudai is just the daughter
of a concubine.

234
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,120
Even if Xu fancies her,

235
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,750
she'll just be a concubine.

236
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,880
There's no need to mind it.

237
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:12,380
(So Lin Yudai hasn't won
Noble Consort Sun's favor.)

238
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,200
I've been busy recently

239
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,410
and I feel a bit tired.

240
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,390
Let's talk another day.

241
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,360
Yes.

242
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,560
You, Yue...

243
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,960
If you truly like

244
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,380
that Lin Yudai,

245
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,080
you can take her in after marriage.

246
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,010
Do you have to make it
known to everyone?

247
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:45,210
Do you know what status
Ning Chuxi has?

248
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,560
Do you know how much
it would benefit you

249
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,560
to marry her?

250
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,560
The Crown Prince is increasingly
valued by your father.

251
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,400
And you're under suspicion

252
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,720
after he was attacked.

253
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:58,410
You're currently struggling in court.

254
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,680
Marrying Ning Chuxi

255
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,150
and having Prince Ning's support

256
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:05,290
is an entirely
advantageous move for you.

257
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,240
Think it over carefully.

258
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:27,330
Xu.

259
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,970
Did your mother pressure you again?

260
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,440
Yudai,

261
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,880
I'm sorry, I...

262
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:44,160
Xu,

263
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,360
are you still going
to marry Princess Yuexi?

264
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,360
Yudai.

265
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,000
I'm sorry.

266
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,760
No matter whom I marry,

267
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,640
the one I care for
has always been you.

268
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,840
It's just there's no other choice.

269
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,560
I have to do this.

270
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,760
I know. I don't blame you.

271
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,280
As long as I can be with you,

272
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,110
I'm already content.

273
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,040
(Ning Chuxi.)
