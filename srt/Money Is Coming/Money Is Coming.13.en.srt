16
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,620
=Episode 13=

17
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,360
(The one lying here is
the only daughter of Prince Ning,)

18
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,750
(and the benefactor who took an arrow
for the Crown Prince.)

19
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,320
(Last time, she was poisoned
and called His Highness a doll.)

20
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,920
(They must have a close relationship.)

21
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,360
(Luckily,)

22
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,840
(though she's seriously injured,
it was only a scare.)

23
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,440
(If something had happened,
I wouldn't have the face...)

24
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,400
(I wouldn't dare face the Crown Prince.)

25
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,440
What is Her Grace holding?

26
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,120
Could you show it to me?

27
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,830
(This is...)

28
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,200
This is a rare medicinal herb.

29
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,720
Since Her Grace obtained it,

30
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,200
it naturally belongs to her.

31
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,520
But this herb
needs to be processed quickly

32
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,980
to preserve its medicinal properties.

33
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,540
May I take the herb back first

34
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,570
and return it after processing?

35
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:41,950
Speak.

36
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,200
The arrow from Her Grace's
left chest has been removed.

37
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,120
Fortunately, it was slightly off

38
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,360
and missed the vital area.

39
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,240
Plus, Her Grace's always been healthy,

40
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,080
so her life is not in danger.

41
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,520
Is there anything else wrong with her?

42
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,880
Will there be any aftereffects?

43
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,240
Her Grace might have a fever tonight.

44
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,880
But as long as the fever
subsides by morning,

45
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,080
there will be no major issues.

46
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,360
Just take care of her
during the recovery

47
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,800
and there will be no aftereffects.

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,280
Your Highness, please return.

49
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,760
Have the physician
check your injuries as well.

50
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,850
Thank you for saving me today,
Prince Ning.

51
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,480
I shall take my leave for now.

52
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,720
I will visit her again tomorrow.

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,880
I noticed

54
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,560
the arrow that hit Her Grace
was not poisoned

55
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,000
but it was coated
with a compound medicine juice.

56
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,160
Medicine juice?

57
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,600
Yes, it is made
by grinding various herbs.

58
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,800
It's harmless to ordinary people,

59
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,360
but it can trigger the toxicity
of "Dream Drunkenness".

60
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,160
The enemy was obviously prepared.

61
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,560
Even if the assassination fails,

62
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,760
as long as you're slightly wounded

63
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,920
by this arrow,

64
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,720
you would succumb to the toxicity
of "Dream Drunkenness"

65
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,800
and meet an untimely death.

66
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:16,920
Your Highness,

67
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,840
before Princess Yuexi fell unconscious,

68
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,480
she unintentionally pulled
a wildflower by its roots

69
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,360
from the forest floor.

70
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,880
I confirmed multiple times
and discovered

71
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,920
it is the Hidden Face Flower
we've been seeking.

72
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,300
Most importantly,

73
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,570
this is the last ingredient needed

74
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,970
to eliminate the Dream Drunkenness
toxin in you.

75
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:39,560
However, the remaining toxin
is particularly stubborn.

76
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,720
I have a way,

77
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,490
but I'm missing one herb.

78
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:45,240
What rare treasure could it be

79
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:47,370
that even you couldn't find it?

80
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,160
The Hidden Face Flower is not only rare
but also hard to locate.

81
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:55,170
This herb is not particular
about its growing environment,

82
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,520
but it looks far too ordinary.

83
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,760
When not blooming,
it looks just like roadside weeds.

84
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,730
It can be identified when blooming,

85
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,910
but resembles wildflowers too much.

86
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,440
Most importantly,

87
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,440
the Hidden Face Flower
blooms irregularly.

88
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,920
It must be picked when blooming
to retain its potency.

89
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:13,920
I see.

90
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,800
I will send people to look out for it.

91
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,320
As for whether it can be found,

92
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,960
as you said,

93
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,080
it depends on fate.

94
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,720
The destined person?

95
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,960
Master,

96
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,240
His Majesty summons you.

97
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,840
Prince Ning, I'm quite curious.

98
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,840
No one else knew about

99
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,280
the Crown Prince's assassination.

100
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,080
How did you come to know about it?

101
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,600
And you brought so many guards
to save him. Could it be

102
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,360
this was a coincidence?

103
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,080
To be honest, Your Majesty,

104
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,080
this was no coincidence

105
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,800
I received Chuxi's signal,
one that's unique to our family.

106
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,680
I thought she was in trouble,

107
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,440
so I brought people to rescue her.

108
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,040
Unexpectedly,
I also saved the Crown Prince.

109
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,120
She shielded the Crown Prince
from an arrow.

110
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,920
Me and the Crown Prince

111
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,840
will always remember her devotion.

112
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,960
Not at all.

113
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,360
The Crown Prince is the heir

114
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,160
and is essential
to the foundation of our nation.

115
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,560
Chuxi simply did what every citizen

116
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,440
of Great Li should do.

117
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,200
Princess Yuexi and you
have made great contributions.

118
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,920
But you're already at the highest rank.

119
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,760
I don't know how to reward you.

120
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,720
I don't need any reward, Your Majesty,

121
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,220
but I wish to ask for a favor for Chuxi.

122
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,360
If Chuxi wakes up

123
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,800
and has any wishes,

124
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,480
she'll request this favor from you.

125
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,280
I grant it.

126
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,320
(A promise from the Emperor
is more practical than any title.)

127
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,440
Greetings, Father.

128
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,160
You're injured.

129
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,880
Spare the formalities.

130
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,240
Thank you, Father.

131
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,320
How is your injury?

132
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,960
Is it serious?

133
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,550
Thank you for your concern, Father.

134
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,950
Thanks to Prince Ning's assistance,

135
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,960
I'm not seriously hurt.

136
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,720
This time, Prince Ning arrived in time

137
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,120
to save your life.

138
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,960
His contribution is immense.

139
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,360
You flatter me.

140
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,480
This assassination attempt
is of great significance.

141
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,080
Are there any clues about the assassin?

142
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,200
The men in black I captured

143
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,640
all committed suicide by poisoning.

144
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,040
No survivors are left.

145
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,040
But...

146
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,480
Speak.

147
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,960
I found this

148
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,880
(Token)
from their leader.

149
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,920
This is the Third Prince's token.

150
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,560
Father, I'm innocent.

151
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,200
Let the Third Prince see it.

152
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,840
(Someone is trying
to kill two birds with one stone.)

153
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:36,760
Father, this token
does indeed belong to me.

154
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,760
But I've always
respected my elder brother.

155
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,750
I would never commit
such an act of assassination.

156
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,280
Someone must be framing me.

157
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,920
Crown Prince, what do you think?

158
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,440
I believe Xu has been wronged.

159
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,760
The assassin not only tried to kill me,

160
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,760
but also wanted to sow discord
between us brothers

161
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,000
and disrupt the court.

162
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,800
Father, please
investigate this thoroughly.

163
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,040
Your Majesty,

164
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,960
these assassins

165
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,160
carried no information
that could identify them

166
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,760
and all poisoned themselves
upon capture,

167
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,840
yet this token was left behind.

168
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,880
It is indeed suspicious.

169
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,480
I hope you can discern the truth.

170
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,050
The Crown Prince's assassination case

171
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,760
will be jointly investigated by
the Highest Judiciary and the Censorate.

172
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,720
The assassin must be apprehended

173
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,480
to set the record straight.

174
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,000
Thank you, Father.

175
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,600
You may all leave.

176
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,960
The Crown Prince stays.

177
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,920
I take my leave.

178
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,550
Good day, Your Majesty.

179
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,530
Now it's just you and me.

180
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,560
Tell me honestly,

181
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,600
did you do this on your own?

182
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,320
Father, do you not trust me?

183
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:56,600
Princess Yuexi is still unconscious.

184
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,650
If she didn't risk her life to save me,

185
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,840
I would be the one lying there now.

186
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,320
I have indeed envied Xiao Xu,

187
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,280
but I'd never risk my life to frame him

188
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,600
and implicate Princess Yuexi.

189
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,320
Should I have died in the foreign land

190
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,520
and never returned?

191
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,720
So I wouldn't have stirred up
so much trouble.

192
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,040
Nonsense.

193
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,520
I was just asking casually.

194
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,390
How could I not trust you?

195
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,120
You've suffered from this.

196
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,200
I will uphold justice for you.

197
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,600
Thank you, Father.

198
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,280
I trust you, Father.

199
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,440
But I have one more humble request.

200
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,720
Speak.

201
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,880
Princess Yuexi saved my life,

202
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,360
but she is still in danger.

203
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,640
If anything happens to her,

204
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,040
I wish to marry Princess Yuexi
to repay her kindness.

205
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,760
I beg for your permission.

206
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,360
This matter shall be discussed later.

207
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,640
Yes.

by my father, my mother,

229
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,190
and the Duke of State.

230
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,600
I have long been used to being

231
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,000

(It turns out I can also
not be abandoned.)

(I can be firmly chosen by someone.)

239
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,000
(If I knew getting shot
was this painful,)

240
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,640
(I wouldn't have rushed forward.)

241
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,160
Miss, you're finally awake!

242
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,400
Your fever has subsided.

243
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,800
I'm fine, the Crown Prince...

244
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,240
Great, I'll go inform Mr. Ning now.

245
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:28,880
Mei.

246
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,360
Her Grace's temperature
is back to normal

247
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,900
and her wounds haven't become inflamed.

248
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,360
She is now out of danger.

249
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,360
As long as she recuperates well,

250
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,040
once the wound heals,
there will be no further issues.

251
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,800
You brat, you've grown bold,
haven't you?

252
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,100
You even shielded others from arrows.

253
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,500
Do you not care about your life anymore?

254
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:05,640
Old man, I won't dare do it next time.

255
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,000
You dare have a next time?

256
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,240
Do you like Xiao Xingheng so much

257
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,320
that you'd risk your life for him?

258
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,700
(Is it that obvious?)

259
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,100
You've already
shielded him from an arrow

260
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,040
and he's not yet yours.

261
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,680
What?

262
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,920
My daughter isn't like other girls,

263
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,440
who only know to make sacrifices.

264
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,130
If you like him, just go for it

265
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:30,720
and win him over!

266
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,120
I don't think this is what
we were just talking about.

267
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,200
What are you talking about, old man?

268
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,920
He's the Crown Prince.

269
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,600
Winning over the Crown Prince

270
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,840
sounds somehow terrifying.

271
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,990
What's wrong with the Crown Prince?

272
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,160
You're not worthy of the Crown Prince?

273
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:47,410
Exactly.

274
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,340
(That actually makes some sense.)

275
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,440
Well,

276
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,990
take good care of your injuries.

277
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,760
Leave this matter for me to handle.

278
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,680
Winning over the Crown Prince is easy,

279
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,720
but convincing His Majesty is not.

280
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,000
I will

281
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,440
have to think this through.

282
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,960
Old man...

283
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:12,960
Mei,

284
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,060
how's the Crown Prince doing?

285
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,880
After you were attacked,
His Majesty summoned the ministers,

286
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,800
but found...

287
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,960
That's roughly how things went.

288
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,920
The assassins
all committed suicide by poison,

289
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,360
but Prince Ning still
found the Third Prince's token

290
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,640
on one of them.

291
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,720
It seems this assassination

292
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,200
is very complicated.

293
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,360
By the way,

294
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,720
the Crown Prince
bypassed the guards last night

295
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,080
and stayed by your side
the entire night.

296
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,600
I didn't take this arrow in vain.

297
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,260
