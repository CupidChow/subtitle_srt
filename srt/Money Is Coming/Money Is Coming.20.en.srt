=Episode 20=

17
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,200
Autumn is chilly.

18
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,760
Madam caught a cold and is bedridden.

19
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,640
Thinking of her faraway loved ones,
she feels a heaviness in her heart.

20
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,880
Chuxi, hopefully
you could return home soon

21
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,680
to ease her longing.

22
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,000
When I left Yizhou,

23
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,440
Grandma was still spirited.

24
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,320
How could she become so ill?

25
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,680
(She doted on me the most back then.)

26
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,360
(I must go back to see her.)

27
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,400
You're going back to Yizhou?

28
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,890
My father is still on the front lines.

29
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,360
This is not the time
to create more issues.

30
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,600
But my grandma is critically ill

31
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,120
and my father is not here.

32
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,040
I worry about unexpected events
during the trip to Yizhou,

33
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,160
so I've come to seek your help.

34
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,960
The troops left at your home
may not be enough.

35
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,400
How about bring

36
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:18,560
my guards as well?

37
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,800
Also, Mrs. Ning is ill.

38
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,050
The physician I usually use
is highly skilled.

39
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,000
Bring him along

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,840
and all kinds of medicinal herbs.

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,500
I'll have everything prepared for you.

42
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,160
You don't have a personal guard.

43
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,840
I'll have Huailiu
accompany you to Yizhou.

44
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,640
If Huailiu follows me, what about you?

45
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,430
Don't worry about me,
I can protect myself.

46
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,160
Should I feign illness
and accompany you?

47
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,120
Don't joke.

48
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,160
This is when forces
in the capital are restless.

49
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,000
But...

50
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,760
I know you don't care
about these things.

51
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,480
But if you can't
gain power or influence,

52
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,080
even if you accompany me now,

53
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,240
you won't be able
to protect me in the future.

54
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,520
Okay, I'll do as you say.

55
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,760
Rest assured.

56
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,150
I'll be cautious on the trip

57
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,800
and don't let myself fall into danger.

58
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,660
(Xingchen Palace)

59
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,120
Xiao Xingheng, what have you packed?

60
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,340
I'm going to visit the sick,

61
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:25,880
not relocating my entire family.

62
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,450
It's better to bring more, just in case.

63
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,600
These are all precious medicinal herbs.

64
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,560
I don't know about
Mrs. Ning's exact condition,

65
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,450
but surely one of them
will come in handy.

66
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,040
By the way,

67
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,080
this is for you.

68
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,000
What is this?

69
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,680
This is my private seal.

70
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,400
If anything happens,

71
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,400
you can take it to find
Yizhou's magistrate, Zhao Kangyu.

72
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,280
Yizhou's magistrate
is a third-rank official.

73
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,440
The highest administrative officer
in Yizhou

74
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,160
actually works for you?

75
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,280
Did you forget where we first met?

76
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,200
I...

77
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,900
(Xingchen Palace)

78
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:08,600
And this, it's for you.

79
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,080
A bracelet with iris flowers.

80
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:26,480
Help me put it on.

81
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,360
It's beautiful.

82
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:47,920
One bracelet isn't enough.

83
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,280
Get the betrothal gifts ready

84
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,280
and wait for me to come back.

85
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,000
Okay.

86
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,900
(Old Residence in Yizhou)

87
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,360
Grandma, I'm back.

88
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,280
Grandma.

89
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,840
Grandma.

90
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,080
Good.

91
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,760
Good.

92
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,640
My Chuxi is back.

93
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,120
I'm back.

94
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,800
I could leave in peace right now.

95
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,360
Grandma, what are you saying?

96
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:59,240
You will live a long life

97
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,760
to see me get married.

98
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,080
Right,

99
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,410
Chuxi has found her love.

100
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,440
I'm engaged, with the Crown Prince.

101
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,720
Your granddaughter
is soon to be the Crown Princess.

102
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,510
Grandma, are you happy?

103
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,600
I'm happy, of course.

104
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,600
But he is of royal lineage.

105
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,210
What if my Chuxi gets bullied

106
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,900
in the future?

107
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,210
Chuxi.

108
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,980
Chuxi, don't cry.

109
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,400
Life and death are predestined.

110
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,050
I don't feel sad.

111
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,120
You can't be sad either.

112
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,920
Grandma.

113
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,660
Physician, quick!

114
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,200
Your Grace,

115
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,360
Mrs. Ning caught a cold.

116
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,700
Luckily it's not tuberculosis.

117
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,640
The cold entered her body,

118
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:22,520
and recovery is slow with her age.

119
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,500
Due to improper treatment,
inflammation accumulated,

120
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,860
which caused it to worsen.

121
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,200
Can you cure it?

122
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,040
Yes,

123
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:31,160
but the required herbs are rare.

124
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,640
Fortunately, before we came to Yizhou,

125
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,840
His Highness prepared
plenty of medicinal herbs for you.

126
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,180
They can be used just right.

127
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:38,120
But given Mrs. Ning's advanced age,

128
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,320
her recovery cannot be rushed.

129
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,990
It's good she can be cured.

130
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,000
I'll go get prepared.

131
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:47,340
Grandma, did you hear that?

132
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,640
Your illness can be treated.

133
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:52,650
Don't say such
discouraging things again.

134
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,240
Just cooperate with the physician
and recuperate well.

135
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:56,460
Alright.

136
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,480
I won't say it again.

137
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,110
I'll listen to you.

138
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,720
Thanks to the physician
and herbs Chuxi brought,

139
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,920
or I don't know when
my mother's illness would improve.

140
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,040
I should properly thank you.

141
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,360
You're being too formal.

142
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,440
We're family, don't thank me.

143
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,360
Father is still on the front lines.

144
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:20,810
The Ning family relies solely on you.

145
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,040
This is what I should do.

146
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,960
I heard His Majesty has
arranged a marriage for you.

147
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:31,360
I wonder what kind of person
the Crown Prince is.

148
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,290
Can you get along with him?

149
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:37,040
Chuxi, is this marriage your own choice?

150
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,160
(Real family don't care)

151
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,000
(how much honor you bring them,)

152
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,920
(they only care if you are happy.)

153
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:44,960
Aunt, Uncle, don't worry.

154
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,920
The Crown Prince is gentle,
and treats me very well.

155
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,960
This time, the herbs and physician

156
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,440
were all arranged by him.

157
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,840
- That's good then.
- That's good.

158
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,960
(Dating can be very worrisome.)

159
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:20,120
(My longing lasts
till maple leaves grow red.)

160
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,840
Xiao Xingheng should
understand these words, right?

161
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:31,020
(Ning Chuxi)

162
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,320
Miss, your snacks.

163
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,120
Steward,

164
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,480
why is there so much noise outside?

165
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,590
I've seen so many families
holding funerals.

166
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,470
Have many people
died in the city recently?

167
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,480
I don't know if it's because
winter is coming,

168
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,630
many elderly in the city
have caught colds

169
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,880
and are struggling to survive.

170
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:04,640
It's not as cold as last year,

171
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,280
but in the past month,
many elderly have passed away.

172
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,040
All within this past month?

173
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:14,760
Yes, just this past month.

174
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:17,480
Even the coffin shop's business
has improved a lot.

175
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:20,520
Miss, do you think something's wrong?

176
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:25,170
(Something feels off.)

177
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,270
(Am I overthinking?)

178
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,610
You're already sick.

179
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,040
Why are you still cleaning?

180
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,650
Thank you for your concern, Your Grace.

181
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,560
I'm responsible
for sweeping the garden.

182
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,040
The other maids in charge
also caught colds.

183
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,160
I was worried
no one would take care of here,

184
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,920
so I stayed to clean.

185
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,720
Take me to where you live.

186
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,320
So many people are sick,

187
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,880
why hasn't the physician come to check?

188
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,030
Your Grace, the physician has visited,

189
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,200
and said it's just an ordinary cold.

190
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,280
He prescribed some medicine.

191
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,400
Has anyone recovered?

192
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,600
Strangely enough,

193
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,650
no one has fully recovered.

194
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,560
But everyone is just coughing,

195
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,200
with no other issues.

196
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,680
We're afraid to disturb the masters,

197
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,000
so the sick ones didn't dare
to go to the inner courtyard.

198
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,560
There's not enough manpower,

199
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,440
so I went to clean the study.

200
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,480
(No other symptoms,
just persistent coughing.)

201
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,120
Mei, instruct everyone outside

202
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,560
to stay away from this courtyard.

203
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,480
Huailiu, find some guards

204
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,760
and seal the residence.

205
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,950
Have them guard from a distance.

206
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,080
No one is allowed to leave.

207
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,280
I'll go right away.

208
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:03,180
Don't go out, stay here.

209
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,350
Find a way to inform them.

210
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,000
Yes.

211
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,510
Tell someone outside
to summon Physician Xu

212
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,600
and inform Uncle and Aunt as well.

213
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,840
Understood.

214
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,400
Don't come in.

215
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:27,280
Chuxi, what's going on?

216
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,560
- Come out quickly.
- Yeah.

217
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,600
I suspect the people here have a plague.

218
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,320
Plague?

219
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:35,240
Physician, please get fully prepared

220
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,800
before coming in to treat everyone.

221
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,240
Yes, I'll go prepare right away.

222
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,150
Thank you.

223
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,390
Chuxi, is it truly a plague?

224
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,720
Epidemics have always
struck fear into people.

225
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:46,960
If it truly is,

226
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,490
that doesn't just concern our family.

227
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,040
I'm not sure yet.

228
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,770
I also hope it's just a false alarm,

229
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,120
but the outcome might not be ideal.

230
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,720
Uncle, please immediately seal here

231
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,320
and investigate all the servants.

232
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,350
Separate those infected

233
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,800
from those who are not.

234
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,120
Check the inner courtyard as well,

235
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:08,510
especially Songhe Courtyard.

236
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,480
I'm afraid Grandma's illness...

237
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,680
Don't worry, I know what to do.

238
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,520
I'll go now.

239
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,930
But Chuxi, you...

240
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,240
Just in case,

241
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,800
I need to be quarantined as well.

242
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,200
How can that be?

243
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,160
How will I explain this to your father?

244
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,200
Uncle, don't worry.

245
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,560
With Physician Xu here,

246
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,400
containing the plague
is the most important thing now.

247
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,400
Alright, I'll go now.

248
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:34,790
Go.

249
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,980
(Three days later)

250
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,200
Your Grace, you were right.

251
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,920
After repeated confirmation,

252
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,120
I'm sure it is a plague.

253
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,680
What are the specifics?

254
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,960
The first cough appeared
in the East Courtyard.

255
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,000
A servant responsible for purchases
started coughing,

256
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,310
then the servants
who shared a room with him

257
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,980
also started coughing.

258
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,080
And the first infected servants

259
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,080
have started developing fever.

260
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,600
I used various common treatments
to reduce fever,

261
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,520
but none worked.

262
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,920
So it means

263
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,000
the people who have this plague
will cough first, then have a fever?

264
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,080
Yes.

265
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,640
So Grandma's persistent cough...

266
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,720
Please rest assured, Your Grace.

267
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,520
Although Mrs. Ning has a cough,

268
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,550
it is due to lung illness.

269
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,920
Her pulse is different
from those with the plague.

270
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,200
(Fortunately she'll be fine.)

271
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,040
Those afflicted by the plague

272
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,600
seem like having a cold,

273
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,280
but their pulses are deeper.

274
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,720
The cold medicine prescribed earlier

275
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,400
also had no effect.

276
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,880
Do you know how the plague spreads?

277
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,440
Are we at risk of catching it?

278
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,800
These people developed symptoms

279
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,840
three days after contact
with someone coughing.

280
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,640
So it means

281
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,040
if observed for three days,

282
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,240
those without coughing symptoms
are uninfected.

283
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:58,270
Yes.

284
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,600
You've been here for three days
without symptoms,

285
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,040
so you're safe now.

286
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,020
Are there new infections
in the Ning's Residence?

287
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,000
No.

288
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,100
Fortunately, you acted decisively

289
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,720
and sealed the courtyard in time,

290
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,720
so the epidemic was contained

291
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,240
and didn't spread in here.

292
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,440
It didn't spread
in the Ning's Residence,

293
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,920
but it might have spread in Yizhou.

294
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,260
(But it has clearly been
spreading for over a month.)

295
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:32,800
(Why hasn't there been any
epidemic prevention in the city?)

296
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,920
Don't do this, Your Grace.

297
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,480
Physician Xu, please work hard

298
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,120
and find a cure quickly.

299
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:49,320
The people of Yizhou

300
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,320
are counting on you.

301
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,080
Your Grace, rest assured.

302
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,320
I will do my utmost.

303
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,900
(I'm not one to meddle,)

304
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:20,080
(but now, I must do something.)

305
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,240
Your Highness,
news from Yizhou has arrived,

306
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,800
saying there's been a plague.

307
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,640
His Majesty has secretly
decreed a lockdown

308
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,240
and is summoning ministers
for a court meeting.
