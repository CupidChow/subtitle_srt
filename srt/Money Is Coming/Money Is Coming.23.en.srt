Xiao Xingheng,
go to Yu'an Hall to save them!

Your Highness, there's something
suspicious about this plague.

26
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,240
Many people are involved.
You must be extra careful.

27
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,000
And, yesterday we found

28
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,880
the plague originates
from the poisoned well.

29
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:10,640
Today, someone wants
to kill the Crown Princess.

I didn't follow you for just one day.

56
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,600
Now you get yourself into trouble again?

57
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,120
(It really had been a hard time recently.)

58
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,600
Do you think I should

59
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,240
go to a temple and pray?

60
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,760
You should go and pray.

61
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,920
Pray to Buddha
that you won't get hurt again.

62
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,000
This is nothing.

63
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,320
I fell to the ground

64
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,720
after running myself out of energy.

65
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,920
Huailiu is the one truly hurt.

66
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,840
Maybe I should pray for Huailiu too

67
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,040
when I go to the temple.

68
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,640
Luckily, His Highness arrived on time.

69
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,800
Otherwise...

70
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,520
It was indeed timely.

71
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,600
And he was quite handsome.

72
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,920
Who are you calling handsome?

73
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,920
How's Huailiu's injury? Is it serious?

74
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,710
We haven't seen each other for so long,

75
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,320
and the first thing you ask
is about another man?

76
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,600
(He is just jealous of everyone!)

77
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,080
Huailiu is fine.

78
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,480
Just a minor injury. Don't worry.

79
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,840
That's good.

80
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,760
Don't you have
anything else to say to me?

81
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:30,870
Come here.

82
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,880
Come a little closer.

83
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,020
Xiao Xingheng,

84
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,160
I miss you so much.

85
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:05,080
Me too.

86
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,560
Xiao Xingheng,

87
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,620
now I seem to know

88
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,800
what it means for a single word

89
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,240
to determine life or death.

90
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,840
In that situation,

91
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,200
using someone's life to intimidate others

92
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,760
was the best choice.

93
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,880
And that man you killed wasn't innocent.

94
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,390
You did nothing wrong.

95
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,760
Yes.

96
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,640
I thought you'd arrive in a few days.

97
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,400
I led 3,000 cavalry here first.

98
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,640
More is coming.

99
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,080
They'll arrive in a few days.

100
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,720
You came in person.
What about the capital?

101
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,960
Don't worry.

102
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,520
Prince Ning has to the capital.

103
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,080
With him there,
those people dare act recklessly.

104
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,120
This plague is likely
orchestrated by Xiao Xu.

105
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,680
But Xiao Han is also involved.

106
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,130
(Indeed.)

107
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,400
(The plague isn't just targeting me,)

108
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,840
(but also the Ning's Residence
and the entire Yizhou City.)

109
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,500
(If the Ning family and Yizhou
run into trouble,)

110
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,680
(my old man would be affected
on the front line.)

111
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,560
(If something happens to me,)

112
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,920
(my marriage with Xiao Xingheng
would naturally be off.)

113
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,800
(The old man might even
fall out with Xiao Xingheng.)

114
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,400
(It's killing two birds with one stone.)

115
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,880
Such a method of disregarding
human life to achieve a goal

116
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,800
is indeed similar
to Xiao Xu's sinister plan

117
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,600
to gain military power

118
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,840
by sacrificing 150,000 soldiers.

119
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,960
What about Xiao Han then?

120
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,120
I've launched an investigation.

121
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,480
The remaining two people
who stirred up trouble

122
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,160
on the day of the lockdown
are the same ones

123
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,640
who tried to assassinate you twice.

124
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,760
Are you saying

125
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,040
Xiao Xu sent people to
start the plague and stir up trouble

126
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:16,680
while another group
was specifically to assassinate me?

127
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,960
Yes.

128
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,600
Dating is so troublesome.

129
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,480
Do you regret it?

130
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,400
Not really.

131
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,880
But have you prepared
the betrothal gifts?

132
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,000
It's expensive to marry me.

133
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,560
I offer the entire Linhua Palace
as the betrothal gift.

134
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,560
Is it enough to marry you?

135
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,000
Barely enough.

136
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,040
Then I must thank you
for agreeing to marry me.

137
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,120
No need to thank me.

138
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,720
Miss, something's wrong!

139
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,440
The residence is surrounded
by some nobles!

140
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,680
They're shouting for you to come out!

141
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,880
What's the rush? With Xingheng here,

142
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,240
it's not my turn to step out yet.

143
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,280
Just relax.

144
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,040
Li Cheng, are you out of your mind?

145
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,880
How dare you cause trouble
at Ning's Residence?

146
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,920
Did you forget that we're just low-key

147
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,280
so we didn't hang the
"Ning's Residence" plague?

148
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,200
You're mistaken.

149
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,320
We're not here to cause trouble today.

150
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,720
We just want to see Princess Yuexi

151
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,400
and ask Her Grace to give us some herbs.

152
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,800
Pfft, is this how you ask for help?

153
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:56,800
Moreover, herbs are scarce now.

154
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,080
Why should we give them to you?

155
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,360
All you know

156
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,280
is seeking pleasure all day.

157
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,000
You still went out during the outbreak.

158
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,960
And during the lockdown,

159
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,720
you hid at home like cowards.

160
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,370
Those poor scholars

161
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,000
even know to go out and help.

162
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,610
Don't act like you're so noble.

163
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,400
All the medicinal herbs
the Crown Prince sent

164
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,010
were monopolized by you.

165
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:20,240
We're all prominent families.
You can't just feasting

166
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,680
while we don't even
get a sip of soup, can it?

167
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,520
Yeah!

168
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,840
Slandering the Princess

169
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,120
is like defaming the royal family.

170
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,120
The punishment ranges
from exile to beheading.

171
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,720
You'd better think carefully
before speaking.

172
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,400
Stop trying to scare me.

173
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,240
We just want to see Princess Yuexi

174
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,000
and beg for her herbs
to save our elders.

175
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,840
Is it wrong to show filial piety?

176
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,680
Let's go!

177
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,720
My hand, my hand!

178
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,640
- Greetings, Your Highness.
- Greetings, Your Highness.

179
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,520
Who are you

180
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,480
daring to trouble Princess Yuexi?

181
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:01,000
Your Highness, spare us!

182
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,840
It's just my father got affected,

183
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,660
so I wanted to ask Her Grace
for some herbs.

184
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,480
I didn't mean to trouble her at all.

185
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,360
I'll spare your life

186
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,040
because you acted out of filial piety.

187
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,560
Now, all medicinal materials
are distributed by the government.

188
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:20,260
They are prioritized for patients
at Yu'an Hall, temples, and academies.

189
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,750
Others with just coughs
will have to wait a bit longer.

190
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,560
The herbs sent by the court
are already on the way,

191
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,480
and soon everyone will be able
to get medicine.

192
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,640
If anyone needs the medicine early,

193
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,360
don't come here, come to me directly.

194
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,320
Any questions?

195
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,200
- No.
- Then get lost!

196
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,200
Get out, now!

197
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,480
Thank you for your kind help,
Your Highness.

198
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,760
It's my duty. No need for thanks.

199
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,320
Since I'm here,

200
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,560
it's only right
to pay respects to Mrs. Ning.

201
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:54,920
Is Madame Ning available?

202
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,280
Come, please.

203
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,680
The Spring Festival
is just around the corner.

204
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:10,700
Your Highness is alone here in Yizhou.

205
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:14,270
If you don't mind,
spend the holiday here with us.

206
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,240
Yes, Grandma.

207
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,480
Good.

208
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,480
Grandma? We aren't married yet.

209
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,820
You're already calling her that?

210
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,760
What?

211
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,640
What exactly did Grandma say to you?

212
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,020
It's a secret.

213
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:45,470
But I'm curious,
what did you promise Grandma?

214
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,560
We aren't even married.
She just let you call her "Grandma"?

215
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,580
I promised Grandma

216
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:55,960
that none of her worries
would come true.

217
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,720
By the way, she also invited me
to spend the Spring Festival here.

218
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,820
She really sees you as one of us.

219
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,030
We'll be family anyway.

220
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,020
Does that mean my position
in the family is threatened?

221
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,240
There's no home without you.

222
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,600
Master.

223
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,960
Master, the plague that occurred

224
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:33,960
in the palace ten years ago

225
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,720
and the current one have
indeed identical symptoms.

226
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,480
(The plague ten years ago?)

227
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,840
(Have I missed some crucial information)

228
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,480
(in the book?)

229
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,280
What happened ten years ago?

230
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,720
A plague.

231
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,740
The records indicate that

232
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,080
the 17 palace maids
first successively had symptoms

233
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,800
of fever, cough, and high fever,
followed by difficulty breathing

234
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,080
half a month before their deaths.

235
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,100
These symptoms

236
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,300
are identical to those
of the current plague in Yizhou.

237
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,120
Master, Xiao Xingheng

238
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,760
has already found us out.

239
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,040
Within ten days,

240
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,240
he'll return to the capital
with evidence.

241
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,160
What about the investigation

242
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,720
I ordered earlier?

243
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,880
Exactly as you expected,

244
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,160
the plague that swept through Yeting

245
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,440
had symptoms identical to those

246
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,960
of the current outbreak in Yizhou.

247
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,360
I've looked through

248
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,960
the records on the plague in Yeting.

249
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,080
The plague in Yizhou

250
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,560
is indeed of the same origin
with the one in Yeting.

251
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:37,160
So the plague ten years ago
was also man-made?

252
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,000
But why?

253
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,200
Because of Xiao Han.

254
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,760
Right, Xiao Han's biological mother
was a palace maid in Yeting.

255
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,000
- Then...
- Chuxi.

256
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,960
If the person behind this
is who I suspect,

257
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,520
then this matter is far from ordinary.

258
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,560
I must return
to the capital immediately.

259
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,920
I'll go with you.

260
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,000
No.

261
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,740
If you don't want to take me
because you think it's dangerous,

262
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,160
then I must go with you.

263
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,800
At least with me by your side,

264
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,680
you won't put yourself in danger.
