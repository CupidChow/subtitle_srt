=Episode 5=

17
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,220
(Prince Ning's Residence)

18
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,360
Bad news, bad news.

19
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,200
Why are you so flustered?

20
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,880
I'm off today. There are no classes.

21
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,920
News from the palace

22
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,850
that Noble Consort Sun
heard Princess Yuexi

23
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,040
showed remarkable skills
at the flower viewing banquet,

24
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,920
so she specially invited you
to the palace for a meeting.

25
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,520
It's fine that you're outside.

26
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,880
But when you come back,
you act like a limp noodle,

27
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,600
can't even sit properly.

28
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,800
Just refuse if you don't want to go.

29
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,290
It's not that I don't want to go.

30
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,240
I'm just afraid
something might happen.

31
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,760
Don't mind that.

32
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,160
Stand up straight and go.

33
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,640
My house is still standing strong.

34
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,080
I'll see who dares to bully you.

35
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,920
Father, so majestic.

36
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,160
Which way did the sun rise today?

37
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,080
You came to flatter me?

38
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,360
Aunt, you must be joking.
I'm usually very filial.

39
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,760
Just stop causing trouble for me.

40
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,310
That's the best filial duty.

41
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,480
But why did you summon
Ning Chuxi to the palace today?

42
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,560
(Sun Wanran, Noble Consort Sun)
You two have never gotten along.

43
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:46,720
You know I summoned her this time

44
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,920
so you came to watch, right?

45
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,640
She failed to marry my third brother

46
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,920
and embarrassed me for no reason.

47
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:55,480
Why did you summon her?

48
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,640
You're just elevating her.

49
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,040
Aunt, you don't actually plan to

50
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,080
make her your niece-in-law, do you?

51
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,240
I'll be the first to disagree.

52
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,520
Prince Ning holds a special status.

53
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,440
If we can form an alliance by marriage,

54
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:11,540
that's a good thing for Xu.

55
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,840
But she lacks virtue,
manners, and beauty.

56
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:16,040
And my brother doesn't like her.

57
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,640
Those are secondary concerns.

58
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:23,120
Feelings can be cultivated
after marriage.

59
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,880
Princess Yuexi has arrived.

60
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,790
(It's her.)

61
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,880
Save me.

62
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,320
Aunt, save me.

63
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,560
Chuxi, why are you so foolish?

64
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,070
Aunt, save me.

65
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,620
I'm here, don't be afraid.

66
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,360
(Does she have anything to do
with the death of the original host?)

67
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,400
Your Highness, greetings.

68
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,680
Chuxi, it's been so many years.

69
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,740
Why do you seem so distant from me now?

70
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,000
Come here, sit down quickly.

71
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:47,560
Courtesy should not be neglected.
When I was young, you cared for me.

72
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,200
But now, things are different.

73
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,120
You've become so radiant
in the blink of an eye.

74
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,990
You used to make a big scene
about marrying Xu.

75
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,520
I was young and naive.
But you haven't changed at all.

76
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,040
In fact, you look even younger now.

77
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,800
You sure know how to flatter.

78
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,560
Oh, Xu will come to greet me soon.

79
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,200
It's been a while
since you two last met.

80
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,240
We met at the flower viewing banquet.

81
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,560
He heroically saved a beauty.

82
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:23,400
He couldn't stand you bullying me.

83
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,240
Yue'er.

84
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,040
Yue'er is quick-tempered.

85
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,840
Don't take offense.

86
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,840
You worry too much.
The Fourth Princess is being honest.

87
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:40,240
Yue'er, get a cup of tea for Chuxi.

88
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:42,480
You're getting bolder by the day.

89
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,730
No need, no need.

90
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,570
Savor my tea well.

91
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,700
It's very fragrant and sweet.

92
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,200
(It seems I really
have to drink this tea.)

93
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,880
(It's widely known that
she summoned me to the palace.)

94
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,040
(She won't be foolish enough)

95
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,720
(to play tricks in her own palace.)

96
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,080
Thank you, Princess.

97
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,320
(Noble Consort Sun isn't that foolish,)

98
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,120
(but the Fourth Princess might be.)

99
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,600
(Ning Chuxi,
today we'll settle our scores.)

100
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,000
(This aphrodisiac
should work quite well.)

101
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,240
Chuxi, what's wrong with you?

102
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,480
Are you feeling unwell?

103
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,200
(It hasn't even been enough time
for the medicine to take effect yet.)

104
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,400
(What's she up to now?)

105
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,440
I just suddenly feel a little dizzy.

106
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,000
It must be because
of the chilly spring wind.

107
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,800
Should we get a physician
to check on you?

108
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,280
You're still young,
don't ignore these little ailments.

109
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,880
I'm sorry for worrying you.

110
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,440
I actually came today
just to pay my respects.

111
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,660
Because of such a trivial illness,

112
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,120
it would be a bother

113
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,480
to send the imperial physician.

114
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:10,930
Chuxi.

115
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,480
But I really am feeling a bit unwell.

116
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,080
I'm afraid I might
pass on my sickness to you.

117
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:21,000
I'll excuse myself for now.

118
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,920
You're being too polite.

119
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,640
Since you're not feeling well,

120
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,920
you should rest for a while,
and leave once you're better.

121
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,200
Good girl, if you're not feeling well,

122
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,500
you should go back home and rest.

123
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,080
Once you're feeling better,

124
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,430
I'll invite you back for a chat.

125
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,050
Thank you, Your Highness.

126
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,120
Go ahead.

127
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:43,490
You...

128
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,480
You have quite the audacity!

129
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,880
You really are my good niece.

130
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:01,280
Who gave you the guts
to act up in my palace?

131
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,220
You've just been too comfortable
as a princess, haven't you?

132
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,800
I just wanted to embarrass her.

133
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,200
It won't be discovered, anyway.

134
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,360
Do you think everyone is a fool?

135
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,960
Whether it's discovered or not,

136
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,320
as long as it happens in my palace,

137
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,800
can I escape the blame?

138
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,520
Don't even mention your father.

139
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,440
Even if Prince Ning blames us,

140
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,080
it will still be enough for us to suffer.

141
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,400
I'm the royal princess,
and she's just a prince's daughter.

142
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,360
A mere Prince Ning

143
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,720
must obey

144
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,880
whatever my father says.

145
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,000
Go back and reflect on yourself.

146
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,250
Don't leave the palace without reason.

147
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,290
Fool.

148
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,960
Miss, what's wrong with you?

149
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,600
I didn't expect

150
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,320
I ended up getting drugged.

151
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,960
Hold on, I can't make a fool of myself.

152
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,980
What? What drug?

153
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,040
It's nothing. Let's hurry back home.

154
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:24,850
Your Highness.

155
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,240
It's been a long time.

156
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,100
How have you been?

157
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:35,380
Your Highness.

158
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,640
Your Highness.

159
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,290
You look really handsome.

160
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,290
Your Highness, please forgive us.

161
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,710
From where did you come?

162
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:51,600
Your Highness, she just
came from Hanzhang Palace.

163
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,640
This is near my Linhua Palace.

164
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,550
There is always
a royal physician on duty there.

165
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,160
Thank you, Your Highness.

166
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,650
We're taking off!

167
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,240
We're taking off!

168
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,320
Taking off, higher!

169
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,440
Miss.

170
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,020
(Xingchen Palace)

171
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,120
Don't ask me.

172
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,320
I don't know what's happening either.

173
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,760
I'm sorry for her.

174
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,870
I'm sorry for Prince Ning.

175
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,120
I couldn't tell.

176
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,930
Your princess is quite...

177
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,860
Quite wild in private.

178
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,960
Who are you calling wild?
You're the wild one.

179
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,840
How dare you say our lady is wild?

180
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,000
- Don't come over.
- You're the wild one.

181
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,020
You're wild.

182
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,520
It's so hot!
I need to turn on the air conditioner.

183
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,840
It's so hot.

184
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,560
What poison did she take?

185
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,640
Your Highness, it's aphrodisiac.

186
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,520
The effect is similar to drunkenness.

187
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,120
But it also has an aphrodisiac effect.

188
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,160
However, it doesn't harm the body.

189
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,040
Because this drug has little harm,

190
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,560
there is no antidote to alleviate it.

191
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,750
We can only wait
for the drug's effects to wear off.

192
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,730
If Her Grace is weak,

193
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:37,080
after the effects wear off,
she can take a tonic.

194
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,920
Shall we sleep?

195
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,400
(This lady is really bold.)

196
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,760
(Although she's drugged,)

197
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,000
(she still dares
to tease the Crown Prince.)

198
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,520
How long will this last?

199
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,440
About half an hour.

200
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,200
She will be fine
once the effects wear off.

201
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,400
Leave me.

202
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:13,290
You stay here like an idiot.

203
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:17,040
Don't worry, His Highness
won't do anything to Her Grace.

204
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,170
Just stay here.

205
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,310
Any movement
will not escape your ears.

206
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,840
Doll.

207
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,840
You are such a doll.

208
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,240
You are such a doll.

209
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,200
I'm sorry for Prince Ning.

210
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,960
You feel so cold, doll.

211
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,160
Do you still remember who you are?

212
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,800
I'm a mushroom.

213
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,000
What kind of mushroom are you?

214
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:03,470
I'm the cutest little mushroom
in the world.

215
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,880
Do you still remember who I am?

216
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:10,840
You are a doll.

217
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,160
Why are you calling me a doll?

218
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:16,530
Because you look good.

219
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,640
Which part looks good?

220
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,600
Any part.

221
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:30,040
Your eyes are beautiful, they sparkle.

222
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:35,360
Your nose is beautiful,
especially high.

223
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:42,200
Your mouth is also beautiful,
looks perfect for kissing.

224
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,080
