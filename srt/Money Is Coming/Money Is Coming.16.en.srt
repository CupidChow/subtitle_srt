=Episode 16=

17
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,600
Master Huiku and Xiao Xingheng

18
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,280
have been inside for six hours.

19
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,080
Why aren't they out yet?

20
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,120
When the remaining poison is extracted,

21
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,840
it hurts even more
than the onset of poison.

22
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,240
Why hasn't Xiao Xingheng
made a single sound?

23
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,000
Your Grace, don't worry too much.

24
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,440
Since Xiao Xingheng was poisoned,

25
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,400
Master Huiku has studied
this poison for seven years.

26
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,480
Seven years?

27
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,850
Aside from the royal family
of the Liu Kingdom,

28
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,840
he's the most confident
in curing Dream Drunkenness.

29
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,830
Are you saying that
over the past seven years,

30
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,200
he's been silent during
poison outbreaks, like today?

31
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,400
He had his first detoxification
when he was 15.

32
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,840
At that time,

33
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,000
he was trembling from pain,

34
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,080
and sweat drenched him
as if he'd been pulled out of water.

35
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,640
Still, he didn't utter a cry of pain

36
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,840
and shed not a single tear.

37
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,400
Perhaps

38
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:39,030
there's something
even more painful in his heart.

39
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,320
(In the days I didn't know about,)

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,640
(Xiao Xingheng
was growing so arduously.)

41
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,400
(His resilience
rise from the mire of pain)

42
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,480
(and bloom into
the most vibrant flower,)

43
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,800
(allowing me to see the brilliance)

44
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,000
(of his radiant appearance today.)

45
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,480
(I used to think)

46
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,610
(it was absurd that he said my presence)

47
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,760
(helped him calm down.)

48
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,160
(But now, I'm incredibly grateful)

49
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,140
(to bring him a bit of peace)

50
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,890
(so he can briefly)

51
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,550
(escape from this pain.)

52
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:19,480
I'm sorry Bai Queyue

53
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,000
upset you, Your Grace.

54
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,600
You're overthinking.

55
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,920
She doesn't represent your family.

56
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,280
You are magnanimous.

57
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,760
I've arranged a marriage for Bai Queyue.

58
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,600
A few days ago, she was sent
to Jizhou to get married.

59
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,990
Does the Duke of State
have no objections?

60
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,760
Father has grown old.

61
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,680
He has no energy to manage
the younger generation's marriages.

62
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,000
This is what we owe my elder sister

63
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,440
and him.

64
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,960
In fact, Father has already agreed to

65
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,920
your marriage with Princess Yuexi.

66
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,960
Since Bai Queyue made a mistake,

67
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,720
you can choose a girl
from the Bai family's collateral line

68
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,360
and take her as a concubine

69
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,210
to put his mind at ease.

70
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:17,680
I think Princess Yuexi will understand.

71
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,450
There will be no one else.

72
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,560
Think carefully.

73
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,800
Life is long,

74
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,350
and you will undoubtedly
hold a high position.

75
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,480
The fleeting joy
may not last a lifetime.

76
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,200
Look,

77
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,440
the sky is full of stars

78
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,080
yet I've always been in darkness.

79
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,320
When she came into my life,

80
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,440
I finally saw all the stars

81
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,560
and the beauty of this world.

82
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,160
She was never a choice.

83
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,490
She is the one.

84
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,760
I don't know what the situation
is between you two now

85
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,480
and I don't know

86
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,960
how things will develop between you.

87
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,160
I just hope, regardless of the outcome,

88
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,160
you will treat him better

89
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,960
and better.

90
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,960
I'll do my best.

91
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,200
Does it hurt?

92
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,960
(It's been so long
since anyone asked me this.)

93
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,240
Xingheng, does it hurt?

94
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,560
It hurts.

95
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,240
It's okay, be more careful next time.

96
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,600
Come here.

97
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,960
(Since then, no one has cared)
Father, I don't want it.

98
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,320
(about my pain.)

99
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,840
It hurts.

100
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,800
Have a piece of osmanthus cake,

101
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,600
then it won't hurt anymore.

102
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,360
Did you know?

103
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,080
The year I returned to Great Li at 15,

104
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,480
I really wanted to eat osmanthus cake.

105
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,400
Father, why is the reward
always osmanthus cake?

106
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,760
I got tired of eating it.

107
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,200
You naughty boy.

108
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,000
I didn't get to eat it then,

109
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,600
and since that,

110
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,360
I've never had it again.

111
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,400
It's fine.
Without His Majesty's guidance,

112
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,200
you've still grown up

113
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,520
to be graceful and elegant.

114
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:25,070
Just like the osmanthus cake
you missed as a child

115
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:27,550
is resting in your palm.

Yes.

♪Wishing to be by your side♪

123
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,680
(I never regretted that piece
of sweet osmanthus cake)

124
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,600
(I missed as a child.)

125
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,280
(But the piece you gave me)

126
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,920
(is what I've dreamed of all my life.)

127
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,360
Your Highness,

128
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,800
the remaining poison
has been completely removed.

129
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,640
But the potency of
the Hidden Face Flower is strong.

130
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,880
A medicinal bath is required
to dissipate it fully.

131
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:28,460
Otherwise, the consequences
could be dire.

132
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,640
Previously, you asked me a question.

133
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,400
Have you found the answer?

134
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,360
Can the fixed destiny be changed?

135
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,600
(Xiao Xingheng is still alive.)

136
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,540
(Isn't that the best answer?)

137
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,400
You told me to follow my heart.

138
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,040
Now I have found the answer.

139
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:14,750
Your Highness, have you calmed down?

140
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:16,320
Calm down?

141
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,080
You still dare to see me?

142
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,080
What has made you so angry?

143
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,720
Do you know

144
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,490
Xiao Xingheng's poison has been cured?

145
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:41,940
I know, that's why I'm here.

146
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:48,140
Is this how your people handle things?

147
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,950
The assassination attempt
on Xiao Xingheng failed

148
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,950
and his poison was cured.

149
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,510
Or have you long
harbored thoughts of defecting

150
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:03,510
and using me as your pledge of loyalty?

151
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,400
You know

152
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,750
I will never betray you.

153
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,500
Never?

154
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,700
What a ridiculous word.

155
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,480
Remember this.

156
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,240
Your life and everything you have
were given by me.

157
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,160
How dare you talk about that to me?

158
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,280
Let go.

159
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:40,550
Don't worry, I'm here.

160
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:45,640
Moreover, this game
is far from a stalemate.

161
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,640
Even if reaches a stalemate,

162
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,920
I can bring it back to life.

163
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,000
You?

164
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,880
You can't even manage

165
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,800
to assassinate Xiao Xingheng.

166
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,520
What else can you do?

167
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,480
Your Highness,

168
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,960
leave everything to me.

169
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,960
Just wait to see a great show unfold

170
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,360
and get what's rightfully yours.

171
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,680
The palace is full of intrigue

172
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,680
and the royal family is heartless.

173
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:39,240
Everything I do is to survive

174
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,520
and to have some reliance in this harem.

175
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:51,960
Xiao Han,

176
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,320
you're the only one I can trust now.

177
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,840
You cannot betray me.

178
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:59,720
A blade

179
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,640
will never betray its master.

180
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:06,920
I am the sharp blade you forged.

181
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,000
If I betray my master,

182
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:13,150
I will die a tragic death.

183
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:15,300
Very well.

184
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,200
I'll give you another chance.

185
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,680
Did I hurt you?

186
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,480
As long as it's from you,

187
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,920
whether it's pain or love,
agony or hate,

188
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,920
I'll gladly accept it all.

189
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,040
What about now?

190
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,180
Does it hurt?

191
00:13:58,910 --> 00:13:59,860
It hurts.

192
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,200
Good, it should hurt.

193
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,440
Remember,

194
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,200
my heart

195
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,310
hurts ten thousand times
more than yours.

196
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:17,160
When Xiao Xingheng's poison
dissipates tonight,

197
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,160
it will also be his weakest moment.

198
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:23,160
Then I will make sure

199
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:25,860
you watch a good show.

200
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,480
What are you doing?

201
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,160
This is Princess Yuexi's private bath.

202
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,640
Do you intend to force your way in?

203
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,080
An assassin appeared
at the Third Prince's place.

204
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,750
Someone saw the assassin
heading this way.

205
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,480
We're just ordered to search here.

206
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,280
Her Grace is still inside.

207
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,840
She said no one can come inside.

208
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,980
(Xiao Xingheng
is at a critical stage now.)

209
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,550
(Nothing must go wrong.)

210
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,420
Third Prince.

211
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,480
The assassin dared
to attack me just now.

212
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,860
He might hold Princess Yuexi hostage.

213
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:23,190
Searching the hall is also to

214
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,510
ensure Princess Yuexi's safety.

215
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:27,990
Moreover, Father
is also in Yunquan Palace now.

216
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,560
If the assassin escapes

217
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,080
and threatens Father's safety,

218
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:33,120
who can bear the responsibility?

219
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:36,470
Regardless of whether the assassin
entered Yunquan Palace,

220
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:38,960
if the Third Prince forces his way in,

221
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:41,940
Ning Chuxi's reputation
will surely be damaged.

222
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,720
By then,

223
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:46,160
for the sake of Ning Chuxi's reputation,

224
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,300
Father and Prince Ning

225
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:52,430
would have to marry Ning Chuxi
to the Third Prince.

226
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:02,840
Perfect scheme.

227
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:16,910
Xiao Xu, if you dare to step in today,

228
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,590
my family will be at odds with you.

229
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:27,830
What are you waiting for?

230
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,820
What if Her Grace
is being held hostage inside

231
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,280
and is forced to say this?

232
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,450
Step aside!

233
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,060
Third Prince, this seems inappropriate.

234
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,980
If Her Grace's reputation is tarnished,

235
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:51,160
your guards

236
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,310
will likely be unable
to bear Prince Ning's wrath.

237
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,160
I was disrespectful

238
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:08,700
in the heat of the moment.

239
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,560
Please don't take offense.

240
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,000
General Bai,

241
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:17,910
if Her Grace's life is threatened

242
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:19,760
and anything goes wrong,

243
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:22,360
can you bear this responsibility?

244
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,760
If he can't bear it,

245
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,440
I surely can.

246
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,400
I want to see

247
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,520
- who dares to tarnish
- Old man.

248
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,910
my daughter's reputation
for a mere assassin?

249
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,200
Prince Ning,

250
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,520
it's better to send in a trusted maid

251
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,110
or a nanny to accompany them inside.

252
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,920
This way, Her Grace's safety is ensured

253
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:45,460
and it fulfills the duty
of catching the assassin.

254
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,570
Xiao Xu,

255
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:47,850
you're really cunning.

256
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:00,480
Your Grace, I've brought the nanny.

257
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,820
