=Episode 4=

17
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,640
So, I have a request to make.

18
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,050
Though I unintentionally
hurt you yesterday,

19
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,880
I've realized that

20
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,600
you can calm me down

21
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,000
during my episodes.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,200
So I specially invited you today
to treat me.

23
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,560
To treat you?

24
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,940
(Suffering from a chronic illness,
prone to violent episodes.)

25
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:46,920
(Only a certain woman can cure him.)

26
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,920
(Isn't he the perfect masculine type?)

27
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,720
Is there something on my face?

28
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,240
An extraordinary aura.

29
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,800
I have a few questions.

30
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,680
Feel free to ask.

31
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,720
Did you, since childhood,
never allow any woman

32
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,720
to get close to you, except for me?

33
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,520
No.

34
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:15,550
Then did your brother

35
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,460
fight bloodily and was framed
by corrupt officials,

36
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:21,400
so you need to endure humiliation
to clear the injustice?

37
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,640
I only fight victorious battles.

38
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,920
One last question.

39
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,000
Do you have

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,520
an ill mother, a cruel father,
and a sister who goes to school?

41
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,880
My mother has passed away.

42
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,080
My brothers and sisters are all well.

43
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,250
(Why did this happen to me?)

44
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,760
(I'm not destined
to be the female lead,)

45
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,740
(but I encountered a disease
that only a female lead can cure.)

46
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,280
(What kind of situation is this?)

47
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,320
How should I treat you then?

48
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,040
You don't need to do anything.

49
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,560
Just come to the attic every five days,

50
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,670
and stay for four hours.

51
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,310
Spend four hours together with you?

52
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,150
Yes.

53
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,760
I've discovered

54
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,200
as long as you're by my side,

55
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,760
I can remain calm,

56
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,570
and my headache eases considerably.

57
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,000
(It's really a Mary Sue setup.)

58
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,760
(But yesterday, it did seem like)

59
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,000
(after I approached him,)

60
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,440
(his emotions slowly calmed down.)

61
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,400
(Seems like he needs my favor.)

62
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,760
Why should I help you?

63
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,240
I'm not exactly a good person.

64
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,200
It's no trouble accompanying you

65
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,720
for four hours every five days.

66
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,640
But I come from Prince Ning's Residence.

67
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,200
My father holds military power.

68
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,700
If others know I'm too close to you,

69
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:43,150
it won't do us any good.

70
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,680
What do you want?

71
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,200
I want you to protect my family
for a lifetime of peace.

72
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,000
Does this statement
represent you personally

73
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,760
or does it represent the entire family?

74
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,800
You must know

75
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,080
three years ago,
because of my ignorance,

76
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,280
my father

77
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,160
almost risked everything on Xiao Xu.

78
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,760
(A simple "ignorance"
dismisses the past mistake.)

79
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,160
(Princess Yuexi is open-minded.)

80
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,560
What do you mean?

81
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,560
What I mean is

82
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,040
my choice is my family's choice.

83
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,440
You don't trust me?

84
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,160
No, I believe you.

85
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,400
Then why are you smiling?

86
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,240
I'm just curious, why is it me?

87
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,480
I thought you would turn to Xiao Xu.

88
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,720
After all, you two almost
had an arranged marriage.

89
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,600
To be honest,

90
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,440
I don't mind who
ascends the throne in the end,

91
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,560
as long as it's not Xiao Xu.

92
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,400
And you're precisely
the most suitable candidate.

93
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:13,960
From love comes hatred?

94
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,560
No, I never loved him.

95
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,200
Then why is that?

96
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,960
Xiao Xu can't protect my family.

97
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,560
Or I could say

98
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,150
he doesn't care about my family.

99
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,480
So you don't need to worry

100
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,640
that I might be swayed

101
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,880
by personal issues.

102
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,240
In fact,

103
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,170
if you could accidentally

104
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,360
make Xiao Xu disappear,

105
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,880
I would be even more grateful.

106
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,280
I don' have such great abilities

107
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,040
to protect your family for a lifetime.

108
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,160
No, you do. Even not now,

109
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:55,790
you will have it in the future.

110
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,420
My entire family

111
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,950
are loyal to the country
and love the Emperor.

112
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,750
Unfortunately, there is no successor.

113
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,950
So I don't seek inherited prosperity.

114
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,770
I only seek peace and prosperity
in this lifetime.

115
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,640
What you desire is all for your family.

116
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,120
What about yourself?

117
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,240
You have no personal desires?

118
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,160
Me?

119
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,780
Except for the girls in the palace,

120
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,300
I am already the most
honored woman in the world.

121
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,620
As long as you can protect
the prosperity of my family,

122
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,580
no matter how I act recklessly,

123
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,460
no one will dare to bully or insult me.

124
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,540
I will not fail your trust.

125
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,550
(This is settled?)

126
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,900
(Was it that easy?)

127
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,580
(I thought it would take more rounds.)

128
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,380
(He decided such a big matter)

129
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,500
(with just one light sentence.)

130
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,300
Your Grace.

131
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,900
(Qinchun Pavilion)

132
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,100
Master has suffered from illness
for many years

133
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,650
and has tried all kinds of methods,

134
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,330
but still never had
a good night's sleep.

135
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:16,980
Your presence

136
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,950
has miraculously helped him calm down.

137
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,520
Even if it's just a good night's sleep,

138
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,100
it has greatly alleviated

139
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,380
his years of suffering.

140
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,420
We will always remember

141
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,820
this kindness of yours.

142
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,540
It's simply a mutual benefit.

143
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,500
Still, I must thank Your Grace.

144
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,420
Master may seem cold on the outside,

145
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,940
but he's fair
in rewards and punishments.

146
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,620
He always sincerely
protects those close to him.

147
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,980
As long as you stand with him,

148
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:43,990
he will never let you down.

149
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,300
(These words are both
a promise and a threat.)

150
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,140
I hope so.

151
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,100
(Since he promised
to protect my family,)

152
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,140
(as long as we don't
stab him in the back,)

153
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:08,780
(I believe he won't just discard us.)

154
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,900
(If he truly breaks his word,)

155
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,980
(then I will just fight to the death)

156
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,740
(like the original story.)

157
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,180
(As for who wins and who loses,)

158
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,940
(it's still uncertain.)

159
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,100
(Five days later,
Prince Ning's Residence)

160
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,820
You haven't finished your breakfast.

161
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,780
Today I haven't finished
my music, chess, calligraphy,

162
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,980
painting, poetry and song lessons.

163
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,380
You're my daughter.

164
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,220
It's fine if you can't do all of them.

165
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,380
My mother passed away early.

166
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,540
There's gossip all over the capital

167
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:07,160
that I didn't inherit anything from her.

168
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:12,720
I feel like crying.

169
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,140
Alright, come back early.

170
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,460
Got it, old man.

171
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:28,740
(First day at work)

172
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:37,820
Hey.

173
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,290
- (Isn't this)
- Miss, we've arrived.

174
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,650
(the book I saw in his carriage?)

175
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,100
I'll fold it and read it next time.

176
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,930
Why is this book here?

177
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,500
I guessed you would like it,
so I brought it.

178
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,100
How thoughtful, Your Highness.

179
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,140
Wow.

180
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,360
This is delicious. Sweet.

181
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:08,940
There are many here.

182
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:19,420
(Boring.)

183
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,580
(How to pass the time?)

184
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,220
I'll tell you a story.

185
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,740
Story?

186
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:29,610
Yes.

187
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:30,450
Okay.

188
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,180
A long, long time ago,

189
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,740
there was a little prince.

190
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,900
He ate and slept alone every day,

191
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,290
watching the sun rise and set.

192
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,420
Suddenly, one day,

193
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,460
a beautiful rose
bloomed beneath his feet.

194
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,820
What kind of flower is a rose?

195
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,660
It's a flower that represents love.

196
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:00,220
The little prince had never
seen such a beautiful flower.

197
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,380
He fell in love with this rose,

198
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,180
caring for it carefully.

199
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:08,090
He watered it, removed pests,
and chatted with it every day.

200
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,400
Later, he learned how to plant flowers?

201
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,340
Listen to me.

202
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,540
The little prince thought

203
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:18,260
that his rose
was the only one in the world.

204
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,300
There were no others like it
anywhere else.

205
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,180
Yes.

206
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:23,130
However, suddenly one day,

207
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,510
he walked into a garden.

208
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,430
In the garden,

209
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,700
he saw five thousand identical roses.

210
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,700
At this moment,
the little prince realized

211
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:37,360
that his rose was just an ordinary rose.

212
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,410
How could it be an ordinary rose?

213
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,300
That was the rose that kept him company

214
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,440
during his loneliness.

215
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,490
That was a rose
that belonged only to him.

216
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:51,300
Your Highness, impressive.

217
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,660
Your story is very interesting.

218
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,300
I like it very much.

219
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:02,110
You haven't finished your book yet.

220
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,220
