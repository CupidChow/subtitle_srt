=Episode 22=

17
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,120
Your Grace, you were amazing just now.

18
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,200
Especially when you killed

19
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,400
that scheming villain.

20
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,560
You were like a decisive female general!

21
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,720
To be honest, with so many people
watching me just now,

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,400
I felt weak in the knees
and numb in the scalp.

23
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,080
It's better now,

24
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,880
not thinking about anything,
that suits me.

25
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,680
Forcing a socially anxious person
to give a speech publicly

26
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,440
is simply inhumane.

27
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:51,920
Your Grace,

28
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,080
the commoners have been settled.

29
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,080
However, medicinal supplies
are critically scarce.

30
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,520
The treatment of severe patients

31
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,520
is a major problem

32
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,800
due to a lack of manpower.

33
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,760
Don't worry, there will be a way.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,520
Then I shall take my leave.

35
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,070
This will be done in a minute.

36
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,720
Be careful!

37
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,280
Take this to be decocted.

38
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,760
Here, here.

39
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:38,100
(Yu'an Hall)

40
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,640
Feeling better now?

41
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,540
Slowly, slowly.

42
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,840
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

43
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,280
Where is Chunhua?

44
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,640
I brought her candied haws.

45
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,640
Chunhua fell ill last night

46
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,160
and passed away.

47
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,360
Your Grace.

48
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,160
It's all due to my incompetence

49
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,840
that I haven't found a cure.

50
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,200
All right.

51
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,700
Miss, you're so beautiful.

52
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,640
When I come next time,

53
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,920
I'll bring you candied haws,

54
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,810
okay?

55
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,480
Thank you, Miss.

56
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,720
Good girl.

57
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,880
(If this plague, which has taken)

58
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,840
(so many innocent lives,)

59
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,520
(is not a natural disaster
but a man-made one,)

60
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,120
(I'll make sure those responsible
pay the same price.)

61
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,880
Did you find out?

62
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,960
I found that in the past month,

63
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,760
among the first households
to hold funerals,

64
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,020
more than half

65
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,180
were from the same alley.

66
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,010
From the same

67
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,800
alley?

68
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,990
How could it be such a coincidence?

69
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,060
If this plague is man-made,

70
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,960
then this alley must be the source.

71
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,000
Go ask each household

72
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,360
to see where they usually

73
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,680
purchase their daily supplies

74
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,880
and get the water.

75
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,720
Yes.

76
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,020
It seems behind this plague,

77
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,780
there lies a greater conspiracy.

78
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,080
Ma'am,

79
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,900
where have you been
getting your water lately?

80
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,680
Oh.

81
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,720
Where have you been

82
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,680
getting your water lately?

83
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,840
Over there.

84
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,240
Your Grace, I found out

85
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:46,880
Jing'an Alley is located
in the west market.

86
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,160
Most people go there for supplies.

87
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,480
There's a large well
at the end of Jing'an Alley.

88
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,960
Those without wells in their courtyards

89
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,080
go there to fetch water.

90
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,040
A well?

91
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,200
Let's check out the well then.

92
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,620
Has this well experienced

93
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,400
anything unusual recently?

94
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,960
Unusual things?

95
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,360
Oh, right,

96
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,800
a granny just complained

97
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,480
that some rascal earlier

98
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,280
threw old clothes into the well.

99
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,600
People scolded him for a long time.

100
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,410
(Old clothes?)

101
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,480
Get Physician Xu here

102
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,040
and have him inspect this well.

103
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,880
Yes.

104
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,240
Your Highness, Ning Chuxi

105
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,080
has already found out.

106
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,070
Dead or deaf?

107
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,720
What use do I have for you?

108
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,560
You can't even handle a mere girl

109
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,880
and you dare face me!

110
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,530
If she gets in the way, just kill her.

111
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,120
Isn't it a simple thing to do?

112
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,720
Loser!

113
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,060
Ning Chuxi has Prince Ning
and the Crown Prince behind her.

114
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:22,800
Even Yizhou's magistrate
listens to her every word.

115
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,600
Our man was caught

116
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,480
and killed among the crowds.

117
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,920
She has a formidable guard by her side.

118
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,940
It'll be hard to strike.

119
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:35,320
She's been in Yizhou for so long,

120
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,560
and hasn't contracted the plague.

121
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,360
How fortunate.

122
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,480
When she arrived in Yizhou,

123
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,000
people in the Ning family
were already coughing and feverish.

124
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,800
But she reacted quickly,

125
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,560
and immediately quarantined everyone.

126
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,320
I don't care what methods you use.

127
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:03,480
Silence everyone
who shouldn't be talking.

128
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,920
Yes.

129
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,880
Your Grace,

130
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,390
all the nearby pharmacists
have raised prices dozens of times.

131
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,480
If this continues,

132
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,500
we will be short of money.

133
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,200
What about the neighboring counties?

134
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,320
Same situation.

135
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:29,480
It seems they came prepared.

136
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:30,870
Indeed.

137
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,040
Your Grace, be careful!

138
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,360
Huailiu, are you okay?

139
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:45,280
I'm fine.

140
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,480
Miss, are you okay?

141
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,000
I'm fine. Quickly,
help Huailiu into a room.

142
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,040
Oh, yes.

143
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:07,430
(All the guards and servants
in the Ning's Residence)

144
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,210
(must be screened again.)

145
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,170
(There might still be hidden spies.)

146
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,160
Physician.

147
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,680
Your Grace.

148
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:33,240
Fortunately, the knife
didn't go in too deep,

149
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,040
and it missed any vital organs.

150
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,440
Plus, the treatment was timely.

151
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,280
Huailiu is out of danger now.

152
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,440
Will it have any aftereffects?

153
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,080
Rest assured, Your Grace.

154
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,200
I'll prescribe some
inflammatory medicine first.

155
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,050
With gradual care,
a full recovery is expected.

156
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,540
- Your Grace.
- Hey.

157
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,680
How could I deserve
such a great courtesy from you?

158
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,360
You saved my life.

159
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,520
How could you not deserve it?

160
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,120
Your Grace, you overpraise me.

161
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,160
Protecting you is our duty.

162
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,880
But you serve Xiao Xingheng.

163
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,760
If not for orders to protect me,

164
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,040
you wouldn't have had
to follow me to Yizhou

165
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,120
and face such danger.

166
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,520
Don't blame yourself, Your Grace.

167
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,800
I just feel guilty toward you.

168
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,680
You

169
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,160
feel guilty toward me?

170
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,560
Previously, when you
were framed by Lin Yudai,

171
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,400
I was originally ordered
to secretly protect you.

172
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,080
At that time, I stationed people
outside Yuchang Pavilion.

173
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:53,560
But due to my negligence,

174
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,160
you were abducted,

175
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,360
and almost got harmed.

176
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,120
This is my fault.

177
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,090
Are you saying Xiao Xingheng

178
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,600
already had you secretly protecting me?

179
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,200
I protected you with my life

180
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,480
because if anything happened to you,

181
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,400
Master would not only go mad,

182
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,320
but also

183
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,760
would not survive alone.

184
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,680
Sorry,

185
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,520
I shouldn't have said so much.

186
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,680
But I just hope

187
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,280
you don't feel guilty over my injuries

188
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,160
and I hope you'll cherish yourself.

189
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,080
Thank you for telling me this.

190
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,040
But no matter what,

191
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,720
your act of saving me
is still real gratitude.

192
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,720
Miss.

193
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,520
Miss, news has arrived.

194
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,650
His Highness has led people
to reach outside the city.

195
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,160
Bad news!

196
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,760
Yu'an Hall is in trouble!

197
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,320
It seems these people
learned the assassination failed,

198
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,720
and found out the reinforcements
are arriving soon,

199
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:05,220
so they are desperate
to take my life here.

200
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,560
If the assassin enters Yu'an Hall later,

201
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,480
I'll cover you to run forward.

202
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,200
Just head straight to the city gate.

203
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,520
The city guards and Master
should arrive shortly.

204
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,880
Yu'an Hall is full of the elderly,
weak, and sick.

205
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,760
If these assassins storm in,

206
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,200
then Yu'an Hall will be doomed.

207
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,040
Your Grace,

208
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,680
don't think too much now.

209
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,880
Your Grace, get ready.

210
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,200
If I tell you to run,

211
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,560
you must run immediately.

212
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,120
Don't look back.

213
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,800
Stop hiding, just go!

214
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,320
Your Grace, run!

215
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,560
Run!

216
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,360
(Run faster, run faster.)

217
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,880
(Faster.)

218
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,000
(Huailiu and the people in Yu'an Hall
are still waiting for me.)
