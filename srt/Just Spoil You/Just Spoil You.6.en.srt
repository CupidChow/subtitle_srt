Han Donglai.

5
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,160
Why does my life become a mess

6
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:59,610
every time I meet you?

7
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:01,190
You are my bad luck!

8
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:14,470
Mom.

9
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,670
Uncle Han.

10
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:16,990
Get in.

11
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:18,400
It's warm in the car.

12
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:21,500
Kele, good boy. Let's not ride in others' car.

13
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:22,070
Come on.

14
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,130
I will take you home.

15
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,180
No.

16
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,820
It's cold outside.

17
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,300
Mom, get in.

18
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:28,740
Mom, hurry. Get in.

19
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,150
-Get in.
-Get in.

20
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,039
Handsome Dad's hands are so warm.

21
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,440
What's your plan later?

22
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,100
Find a hotel and settle down tonight first.

23
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,780
With the International Exposition under way,

24
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,470
it'll be hard to find a vacancy this late.

25
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:07,990
There are always vacancies in small hotels.

26
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:09,930
Kele has just been discharged from the hospital.

27
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,490
How can he endure all that trouble?

28
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,630
Stay at my place.

29
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:15,320
Your place?

30
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:16,510
No.

31
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:18,460
It's an unused house of my family's.

32
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,200
Let's do it for Kele.

33
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:25,400
Thank you.

34
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,010
You say "thank you" so much.

35
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,100
Can you ever repay me?

36
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,720
You're still so high-handed.

37
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,620
Where am I?

38
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:48,720
Here?

39
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,010
-This is Uncle Han's...
-This is the new home Uncle Han prepared for Kele.

40
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,360
Wow. Really?

41
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,460
Tonight,

42
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,860
I want to share the bed with Uncle Han and mom.

43
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,660
-No.
-No.

44
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,390
It's a deal.

45
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,030
Uncle Han can only accompany you for one night.

46
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,220
Fine.

47
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,400
-I can do it myself.
-Okay.

48
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:11,960
You may leave.

49
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:23,280
Leave.

50
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:24,600
Okay.

51
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:36,380
Ms. Zhong.

52
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:38,860
I'm sorry

53
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,420
that Kele was so headstrong

54
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,880
that he insisted on Mr. Han staying.

55
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:42,610
Well...

56
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:43,350
It's fine.

57
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,840
Thank you for taking care of Young Master.

58
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:46,720
By the way,

59
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,460
here are two bottles of pills.

60
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,810
Take these before bed every day.

61
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:52,570
One pill each time.

62
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,050
Take one of these every morning and evening.

63
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:56,670
Okay, I'll keep it in mind.

64
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:57,870
If there's nothing else,

65
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,750
I'll head back.

66
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,500
You have a rest as well.

67
00:03:59,520 --> 00:03:59,780
Okay.

68
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,700
Kele.

69
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,520
Are you done?

70
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,670
It's bedtime.

71
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,029
Bedtime!

72
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,209
Bedtime with Uncle Han!

73
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:21,579
Kele, slow down.

74
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,190
Watch out for Uncle Han's legs.

75
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,430
I'm sorry.

76
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,460
Uncle Han, does it still hurt?

77
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:29,530
No.

78
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,450
Your pills.

79
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,800
Thank you.

80
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,370
I'll turn off the lights.

81
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,100
Kele.

82
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,280
Let us not play with the toy anymore.

83
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,340
It's time to sleep.

84
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:07,140
Okay.

85
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:15,820
Kele, be good. Sleep tight.

86
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,320
I'll sleep outside after...

87
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:28,520
after I coax Kele into sleeping.

88
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:29,230
Okay.

89
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:38,580
Don't think about it.

90
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:39,820
Go to sleep.

91
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,380
What is this hard thing?

92
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:00,420
What should I do?

93
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:01,850
No way.

94
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,460
It's Kele.

95
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,160
How could I forget that Kele is in the middle?

96
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,870
It's so embarrassing.

97
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:12,400
No wonder they say that being single for too long will...

98
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,980
Forget it.

99
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,140
I have to sleep outside.

100
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,440
I can't bear it anymore.

101
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,260
I'll go outside.

102
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:33,300
Time to get up.

103
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:34,320
Wake up.

104
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,540
Mom, wake up!

105
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:39,130
Mom, wake up!

106
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:39,800
Kele?

107
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,400
What's wrong, Kele?

108
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,760
I want to pee.

109
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,330
I'll take you to the toilet.

110
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:44,800
Let's go.

111
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:45,770
But...

112
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,080
Uncle Han is inside.

113
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:49,700
It's okay.

114
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,260
Let's knock on the door.

115
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:50,760
Let's go.

116
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:51,190
Okay.

117
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:55,130
Mr. Han?

118
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:57,040
Young Master Han?

119
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,870
Donglai, are you in there? Donglai?

120
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:04,670
Donglai?

121
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:07,910
Donglai?

122
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:11,690
Donglai!

123
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:12,980
Donglai!

124
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:15,430
Why is it so hot?

125
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:17,540
Kele.

126
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,200
Mom, what's wrong with Uncle Han?

127
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:21,870
Kele, don't be afraid.

128
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,130
Uncle Han's having a fever.

129
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,390
Kele, listen to me.

130
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,870
Can you get me a blanket?

131
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:26,280
Okay.

132
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:28,660
Donglai?

133
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:29,840
Donglai?

134
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,640
The blanket is here.

135
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,080
Kele.

136
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,280
Go get my phone

137
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,600
and call Uncle Mu Chen.

138
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:37,950
Tell Uncle Mu Chen to come here quickly.

139
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,590
Okay.

140
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,180
Donglai?

141
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,200
Donglai, you have to be okay.

142
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:43,710
Donglai?

143
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:44,780
Donglai?

144
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:45,730
I'm sorry.

145
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,440
I'm sorry, Donglai.

146
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,650
I'm sorry.

147
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:50,780
I'm sorry.

148
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:51,630
I'm cold.

149
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:53,520
Don't go.

150
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,220
Don't go.

151
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:55,909
I'm not going.

152
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,550
I'm not going.

153
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,690
I'm not going, Donglai.

154
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,260
Sorry, Donglai.

155
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:01,500
I'm sorry.

156
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:02,920
I'm sorry.

157
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:05,620
I'm sorry.

158
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:08,940
I'm sorry.

159
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,290
I'm sorry.

160
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,360
The fever has gone down.

161
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:19,460
Maybe he caught a cold outside last night.

162
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,030
Since the accident 6 years ago,

163
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,040
Young Master's immune system has always been weak.

164
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,240
Let me take care of him.

165
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,740
I made some porridge just now.

166
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,960
Mr. Mu Chen, please take Kele for breakfast.

167
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,360
Thank you, Ms. Zhong.

168
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:31,940
Kele.

169
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:33,950
Let's go.

170
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:36,840
Handsome Dad, if you don't wake up,

171
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,720
I'll eat all your food.

172
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,190
Let's go.

173
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,400
Maybe I'm your bad luck.

174
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:02,870
Don't go.

175
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:03,790
What?

176
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,150
What did you say?

177
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,050
Don't go.

178
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:16,210
♫But there's no snow near the equator, and clouds don't have a home♫

179
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,900

182
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,870
Mom, Uncle Han is awake?

183
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:33,630
Mu Chen.

184
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:34,950
What happened to me?

185
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:35,870
Young Master.

186
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,600
You had a fever and fainted in the bathroom.

187
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,070
Ms. Zhong has been taking care of you.

188
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,710
Who let her take care of me?

189
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,230
Since Young Master Han is awake,

190
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,880
we won't bother you anymore.

191
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,580
Kele, let's go.

192
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,000
Let's pack things up.

193
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,300
Is this how she treats her benefactor?

194
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:57,430
Young Master's attitude

195
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:58,520
is not good, either.

196
00:09:59,060 --> 00:09:59,390
I...

197
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,700
Kele, go get your baby oil.

198
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,600
What's wrong, Kele?

199
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,870
I want to live at this home.

200
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,960
But this is not our home.

201
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,160
This is Uncle Han's home.

202
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,260
Uncle Han loves me so much.

203
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,900
Uncle Han won't chase me away.

204
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:21,750
Mom, can we stay?
