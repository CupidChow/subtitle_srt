00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,560
Kele wants to live here.

5
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,240
But this is not our home.

6
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,450
This is Uncle Han's home.

7
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:03,700
Uncle Han loves me so much,

8
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,260
he won't chase me away.

9
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,160
Mom, can we stay?

10
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,460
Kele, do you want to stay?

11
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,410
I want to stay here

12
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:13,970
to take care of you.

13
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:19,680
Uncle Han, can you not ask us to leave?

14
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:20,500
Okay.

15
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:21,880
This is Kele's home.

16
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:22,930
Great!

17
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,140
Go!

18
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:27,570
Kele.

19
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:28,680
Kele, slow down.

20
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,740
Ms. Zhong, you should stay.

21
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,680
Young Master is so weak lately.

22
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,360
If I take him back,

23
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,140
Madam will scold me.

24
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,090
But I need to find a kindergarten for Kele.

25
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,070
We've arranged it.

26
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:40,280
The nearby kindergarten.

27
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,710
He can go to school several days later.

28
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:43,190
Well...

29
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,560
It's inappropriate.

30
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:52,220
Uncle Han,  will mom stay?

31
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,080
Mom won't leave if Kele doesn't leave.

32
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,740
So you have to insist on living here.

33
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,470
Okay. Pinky promise.

34
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,170
Uncle, you were sick,

35
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,560
so mom cried.

36
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,920
Is it because you'll die too?

37
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:08,789
No way.

38
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,280
I'll be fine soon.

39
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,570
That's great.

40
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,330
But I will die.

41
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,140
What are you talking about?

42
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,290
It's true.

43
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,410
They always say that
when I go to the hospital.

44
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:25,110
I heard people could become stars after they died.

45
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,410
I don't know if stars can eat cotton candy.

46
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,030
I really like candy.

47
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,110
But the doctor didn't allow me to eat.

48
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,900
Every time I ate it secretly, mom would cry.

49
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:40,430
I don't want her to cry.

50
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:42,850
Be good.

51
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:44,620
I won't let Kele die.

52
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,940
I'm not afraid of death.

53
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:50,350
I'm afraid of leaving mom alone if I die.

54
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:51,710
Let me tell you.

55
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,260
My silly mom

56
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,210
always forgets her keys

57
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,160
and phone.

58
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,620
I'm worried.

59
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,790
Kele has been taking care of the silly Zhong Ling.

60
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,980
Of course. I'm a man.

61
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,310
I have to protect my girl.

62
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,430
Because I don't have a father.

63
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:13,580
If I had a father,

64
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,190
she would have a new child.

65
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,730
When Kele is gone,

66
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,850
mom won't be sad.

67
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,320
That's why you've been looking for your dad.

68
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,710
Yes.

69
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,050
I saw your face in mom's picture book
several times.

70
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,530
You must be my dad.

71
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,620
So you can promise

72
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,510
to help Kele take care of the silly mom,

73
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,450
Right?

74
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,050
You little man.

75
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,520
Donglai hasn't been home these days.

76
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,400
What is he busy with?

77
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,030
Madam, Young Master is doing well.

78
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:52,320
She's asking

79
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,380
where is Donglai

80
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,430
and who he's with.

81
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,550
I haven't seen him in the company when I came several times.

82
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:57,890
Tell me.

83
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,220
Donglai will have surgery in two days.

84
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,520
If anything goes wrong,

85
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,170
can you afford it?

86
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,120
Young Master...

87
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,580
Ms. Zhong has taken care of him.

88
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,190
What?

89
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,670
Why is he with that widow again?

90
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:17,029
I don't think Young Master

91
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,100
wants anyone to say that about Ms. Zhong.

92
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:20,930
Auntie.

93
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,120
I didn't mean that.

94
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,180
Stop sowing discord between us.

95
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,050
Madam,

96
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,210
this is all because

97
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:29,110
Ms. Zhong's landlord was ordered

98
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,430
to kick them out.

99
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,280
Ms. Zhong just signed Tianyu Media,

100
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,380
Young Master can't just let his employee

101
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,440
live on the streets.

102
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,720
Someone ordered her?

103
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:37,620
Yes.

104
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:38,800
I'm investigating.

105
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:39,940
All right.

106
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,240
It's fine if she can take good care of
Young Master.

107
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:43,659
You may leave.

108
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:44,620
Yes.

109
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:47,040
Have a good rest, Auntie.

110
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:52,960
Stop.

111
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,060
Watch your mouth.

112
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:58,940
Look carefully.

113
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,740
Who is your future mistress?

114
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:10,600
Please make way.

115
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:18,930
Zhong Ling.

116
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:19,970
You've gone too far.

117
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,700
It was you.

118
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:27,540
You said you would leave.

119
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,010
You said you didn't want to get involved with
the Han family.

120
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,030
But now?

121
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,200
You slept in the same house with him.

122
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,290
How can you say that to me?

123
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,240
At least I've been with him for six years.

124
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,060
Right.

125
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,030
But did you really take good care of him?

126
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:44,820
You only talk.

127
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:46,460
Do you really know
Donglai's physical condition?

128
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,550
You really came back to
take Donglai from me.

129
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:52,940
If you say so.

130
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:53,690
Zhong Ling.

131
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,020
Let me tell you.

132
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,920
Even if I don't ask,

133
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,330
Auntie won't let you get away with it.

134
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,640
You'd better ask Donglai to go home.

135
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:03,930
That's his freedom.

136
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:04,870
It has nothing to do with me.

137
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:05,580
You...

138
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,210
Did Xiaxi come?

139
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:33,060
Yes.

140
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,210
What did she tell you?

141
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,620
She said

142
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,210
Mr. Han should go home.

143
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,500
You don't need to care about what she said.

144
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,180
I think she's right.

145
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:45,990
You...

146
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,080

00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:09,690
Yes.

190
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,620
Is Donglai coming back soon?

191
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:18,050
Yes.

192
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,390
That's great.

193
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:20,580
I'll go shopping with you this afternoon.

194
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,530
You are the best.

195
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:24,710
I heard that Madam Han has proposed marriage
to the Lin family.

196
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,470
It is said that Young Master Han is still abroad.

197
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,780
Does he know about it?

198
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,410
Donglai and I have been keeping a low profile.

199
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,270
Auntie and my parents are old friends.

200
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,690
So our families have been close.

201
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:37,580
So is the engagement true?

202
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:38,559
Of course.

203
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:40,789
My birthday banquet is in a few days.

204
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,539
Donglai will also come back.

205
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,760
At that time,

206
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,520
we'll have good news to announce.

207
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,830
It is said that Young Master Han was engaged six years ago.

208
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:48,600
Could you please tell me

209
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,540
if Young Master Han's fiancée was Miss Lin?

210
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:53,270
I'm sorry.

211
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:54,180
We have something important to do.

212
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,000
Please make way.

213
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,020
Excuse me.

214
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:00,250
Hello?

215
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,110
Have you received the news script I sent you?

216
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,350
Are you blind?

217
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:07,790
What are you doing?

218
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,120
Stop! Help!

219
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,240
Is anyone there?

220
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,750
Watch your mouth.

221
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,970
It's understood that the president of
Dongsheng Group, Han Donglai,

222
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,580
will marry the daughter of the president

223
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:27,110
of Ren’ai Hospital, Lin Xiaxi.
