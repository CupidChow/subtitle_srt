[Episode 16]

4
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:56,690
He knew

5
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,360
if the case was overturned, he'd expect severe penalties.

6
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,050
So he wanted to take the money before turning himself in.

7
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,210
Where is he? I want to see him.

8
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:04,450
Wait.

9
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:06,890
Listen to this first.

10
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:09,550
I just got released from prison

11
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,020
and you want me to do murder?

12
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:11,789
I've checked.

13
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,210
It'll snow heavily that day.

14
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,630
It's easy to make an accident.

15
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,630
Maybe you don't have to do it yourself.

16
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:17,800
It's such a profitable business.

17
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:18,990
Are you sure you're not doing it?

18
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:20,210
Okay, Miss Lin.

19
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:21,770
You've planned it well.

20
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:23,940
Xiaxi.

21
00:01:25,789 --> 00:01:26,550
He knew

22
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:27,789
someone was investigating him.

23
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:28,590
So,

24
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,260
he wanted to ask Lin Xiaxi for money and run away.

25
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,050
He didn't expect Miss Lin wouldn't give it to him.

26
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:34,090
So,

27
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:35,300
he became desperate

28
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,360
and found me.

29
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:37,490
At least,

30
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:38,220
he'll get a lighter sentence

31
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:39,310
if he turns himself in

32
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,870
and still have the money when he's released.

33
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,060
Call the police.

34
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,210
Wait.

35
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:46,390
Where is Lin Xiaxi?

36
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,180
I want to see her.

37
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:49,950
I suspect that the director

38
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:50,950
was also instigated by her.

39
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,220
Hello, Mom.

40
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,150
Come back for dinner.

41
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,350
Xiaxi is here.

42
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,450
Okay.

43
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:08,610
I'll be right back.

44
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,330
Lin Xiaxi is at my house.

45
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,290
Communicate with him later.

46
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:17,640
We're close to each other.

47
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:18,390
I know.

48
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:19,380
Thank you, ma'am.

49
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,440
You're back.

50
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,090
Donglai.

51
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,079
Why are you here?

52
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,150
Xiaxi is here.

53
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,950
Why do you bring her home?

54
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,450
Are you trying to piss me off?

55
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:34,710
Mom,

56
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,510
you've been deceived by her for so many years and you're still being stubborn.

57
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,280
Can you sober up?

58
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,140
What do you mean?

59
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,620
Sorry to disturb you, Mrs. Han.

60
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,890
I'm here to ask Lin Xiaxi a few questions.

61
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:46,220
I'll leave after that.

62
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,820
I have nothing to tell you.

63
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,440
Director Zhang drugged me

64
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,880
and attempted sexual assault on me.

65
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,470
Did you instigate it?

66
00:02:58,570 --> 00:02:59,280
Did he admit it?

67
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,030
It's really you.

68
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,600
Xiaxi just got confused.

69
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,530
That's because

70
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:11,630
she loved you so much.

71
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:12,590
Donglai.

72
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,570
You grew up together.

73
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:15,870
Just help her.

74
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:16,850
Mom,

75
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,590
you're being confused.

76
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:20,540
Do you know how many illegal things she has done

77
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,600
all these years?

78
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:25,670
Ma'am.

79
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:26,950
I don't want to go to jail.

80
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,300
I know Xiaxi well.

81
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,760
Why don't we ask Xiaxi to apologize to Zhong Ling?

82
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,290
Apologize?

83
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,480
If apologizing worked, then all the evil people in the world

84
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,920
would just have to apologize.

85
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,660
Why do we need the law? Mrs. Han.

86
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,480
Evil people?

87
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:46,530
You're exaggerating.

88
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,790
The director didn't do anything to you.

89
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:50,820
Mom.

90
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:52,250
Why are you still defending her?

91
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,450
Six years ago, she...

92
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:56,360
Six years ago?

93
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:58,870
What happened six years ago?

94
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,720
Tell me.

95
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:01,100
Six...

96
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:01,870
Six years…

97
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,240
Six years ago,

98
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,290
she made Donglai disabled

99
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,290
and abandoned him.

100
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:07,040
Really?

101
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:08,990
What about this?

102
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,610
I've checked.

103
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,030
It'll snow heavily that day.

104
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,800
It's easy to make an accident.

105
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,370
As long as Zhong Ling disappears…

106
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,720
Where did you get it?

107
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:17,850
It's defamation.

108
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,290
I'll sue you for defamation.

109
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,019
Planning murder is a serious crime.

110
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,430
Lin Xiaxi.

111
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,610
Take a careful look.

112
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:24,800
Do you know him?

113
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,360
He's turned himself in.

114
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:35,990
You still don't want to admit it?

115
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,770
Xiaxi.

116
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,580
Is this true?

117
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:44,560
So,

118
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,750
you're the one who disabled Donglai

119
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,159
and put him in a wheelchair for six years.

120
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,409
Xiaxi.

121
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:50,450
Is this true?

122
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:50,930
No.

123
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:51,909
No, ma'am.

124
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:53,250
-I didn’t do it.
-It wasn't you?

125
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,200
You're close to

126
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,340
this guy with two criminal records.

127
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,620
What's your relationship with him?

128
00:04:58,690 --> 00:04:59,590
Ma'am, it's not me.

129
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:00,170
I...

130
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:03,890
Donglai.

131
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,510
You know, Donglai.

132
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,400
I've liked you since I was young.

133
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,300
My only dream is to marry you.

134
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,630
Why would I hurt you?

135
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:11,710
Trust me.

136
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,570
The police will find out

137
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,940
the truth.

138
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,980
You wouldn't hurt him?

139
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:16,550
Six years ago,

140
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,110
you blackmailed me with your father being Dong Lai's attending physician

141
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,280
and forced me to leave Donglai.

142
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:21,990
Didn't you hurt him?

143
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:24,260
Xiaxi,

144
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,970
I'm disappointed in you.

145
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,690
No, ma'am.

146
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:30,890
Ma'am.

147
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,409
I didn't think this would happen.

148
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:35,830
Why?

149
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,650
Why do you trust this bitch

150
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,150
instead of me?

151
00:05:39,409 --> 00:05:42,330
You could even use your father's medical virtues as a tool.

152
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:43,350
Lin Xiaxi,

153
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:44,460
you're so cruel.

154
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,070
No.

155
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:47,600
It's not like that.

156
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,940
Xiaxi.

157
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:51,880
Commissioning murder is a serious crime. You'll have to go to jail.

158
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,030
How could you do this?

159
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,150
Stop it!

160
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,990
I didn't do it.

161
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,540
You've done so many bad things.

162
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,950
Don't you feel guilty?

163
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,630
It wasn't me.

164
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:01,670
It wasn't me.

165
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,480
It's all your fault.

166
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:05,470
It's all your fault.

167
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:09,650
Go to hell!

168
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:10,310
Watch out.

169
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:14,870
Donglai.

170
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:16,170
Donglai.

171
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:19,410
Donglai.

172
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,310
Donglai.

173
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:22,270
Donglai.

174
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:23,750

175
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:24,790
Mu Chen.

176
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:26,290
Mu Chen.

177
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,390
You'll be fine.

178
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,910
Please bless my son.

179
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,470
-Don't let anything happen to my son again.
-Madam.

Doctor.

183
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:39,350
Doctor, how is the patient?

184
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:39,909
My son…

185
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,180
He's out of danger.

186
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,320
He'll wake up after the anesthesia.

187
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,760
Can I visit him?

188
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:44,440
Yes.

189
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:45,670
He has been sent to the ward.

[Emergency]

191
00:06:46,409 --> 00:06:47,690
Thank you, doctor.

192
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:49,590
Doctor.

Is there anything else we need to pay attention to?

194
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,240
The patient needs to recuperate.

195
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:07,970
Mrs. Han.

196
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:11,580
I'm fine.

197
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,240
I just feel a little dizzy.

198
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:16,240
Ma'am, you haven't eaten anything all day.

199
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,700
Why don't you and Mu Chen go back and rest?

200
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,130
Donglai is safe now.

201
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:21,460
I'll take care of him.

202
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:22,910
That's right, Mrs. Han.

203
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:24,440
If anything happens to you,

204
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,540
I won't be able to explain

205
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,570
when Young Master wakes up.

206
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:27,740
Yeah.

207
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,660
Take care of yourself.

208
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32,330
Okay.

209
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:36,630
By the way,

210
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:39,780
I've misunderstood you for so many years.

211
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,970
Please forgive me.

212
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,440
As long as Donglai is safe,

213
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:46,870
I won't care.

214
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:48,550
Mrs. Han,

215
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:49,890
let me take you home to rest.

216
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:50,770
Okay.

217
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,370
Thank you.

218
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,080
It's been six years.

219
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,070
Unfortunately, Kele is not my grandson.

220
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,890
Why did you go fight?

221
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,870
I don't mind being insulted.

222
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,160
No way.

223
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,740
I told you I'd protect you.

224
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:25,020
You should have a lesson.

225
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,180
She's murdering his husband!

226
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,030
Keep your voice down.

227
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,510
This is the hospital.

228
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,530
You fool.

229
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:40,679
Do you know how much my heart aches

230
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:43,600
every time you get hurt protecting me?

231
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,510
I'll make some porridge.

232
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:50,760
Bring it to Zhong Ling.

233
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,200
She hasn't eaten anything all day long.

234
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:52,670
Yes.

235
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:54,030
Mrs. Han.

236
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:55,690
Director Zhang.

237
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,840
I heard your grandson's treatment is effective.

238
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:00,190
Grandson?

239
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,200
Kele.

240
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,980
Wasn't it Kele

241
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,330
who was treated at our hospital for the last paternity test?

242
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,530
So,

243
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:11,730
the identification is

244
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,660
that he and Donglai are related by blood?

245
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:14,790
They're father and son.
