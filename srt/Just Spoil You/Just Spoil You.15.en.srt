4
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:10,370
Come here.

5
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,620
Don't move. Behave yourselves.

6
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,270
Director, what else do you want to say?

7
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,630
-Do you know who I am?
-This is the scene where the director of "Stuck With You" is arrested for prostitution.

8
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:19,590
Do you know who I am?

9
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:20,760
You're under arrest for a sexual transaction.

10
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:21,650
Behave yourself.

11
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:22,440
Take him away.

12
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,570
It's a misunderstanding.

13
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:24,520
Stop filming.

14
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:25,860
Stop it.

15
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:34,690
That's enough.

16
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,670
When we had nothing,

17
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:43,270
and were bullied at the stall,

18
00:01:43,289 --> 00:01:44,229
I could protect her.

19
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,300
When the neighbors laughed at her for raising a child alone,

20
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,440
I could also protect her.

21
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,759
Now that

22
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,270
I have everything,

23
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,930
I can't do anything to those who hurt her.

24
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,940
What's the use of my fame and fortune?

25
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,520
I can't even protect the people closest to me.

26
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:10,889
I never asked about your relationship with Zhong Ling.

27
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,760
But I can tell

28
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,260
your feelings for her.

29
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,260
You're only 23.

30
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,500
Your career is going up.

31
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,150
Is this relationship really appropriate?

32
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:27,990
I don't care.

33
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,840
I just want to be with her.

34
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:37,880
Maybe

35
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:40,860
you'll last longer

36
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,960
as friends.

37
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,329
Don't move. Behave yourselves.

38
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:52,200
Director, what else do you want to say?

39
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:52,920
Hello.

40
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,940
Do you know who I am?

41
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,380
Can you show me the news?

42
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,340
This is the scene where the director of "Stuck With You" is arrested for prostitution.

43
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,460
Do you know who I am?

44
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,560
You're under arrest for a sexual transaction.

45
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,540
Behave yourself.

46
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:00,280
Take him away.

47
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,390
It's a misunderstanding.

48
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,300
Stop filming.

49
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:03,560
Stop it.

50
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,780
The cast of "Stuck with You" has been a constant source of gossip.

51
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,170
The director was arrested for prostitution.

52
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,970
-Manli.
-It not only affects the progress of the project,

53
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,120
but also has caused a serious downfall of Dongsheng Group’s stocks.

54
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:14,880
Why are you here?

55
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:16,200
Don't get up.

56
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:17,579
I just came to visit you.

57
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:19,840
I'm fine.

58
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,890
The doctor said I could be discharged today.

59
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:22,780
Have a seat.

60
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,200
OK.

61
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,260
Chu Mo

62
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,070
told it to you?

63
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:31,220
Yeah.

64
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,480
Chu Mo felt guilty.

65
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:35,990
He said it was because he recommended your comic

66
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,490
to Tianyu,

67
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,760
so…

68
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,050
It's not his fault.

69
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:41,820
Besides,

70
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,740
if he hadn't arrived in time,

71
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,410
I would probably…

72
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:47,790
Chu Mo felt most guilty

73
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,579
that he couldn't punish the director.

74
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:52,480
My silly brother.

75
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,070
That's right.

76
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,110
You seem

77
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,200
to know Chu Mo well.

78
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,140
Chu Mo was abandoned by his mother in childhood.

79
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,800
and has always felt insecure.

80
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,150
So,

81
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,740
he always hides himself with a dishonorable attitude.

82
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,430
It's hard for him to trust others.

83
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:12,620
But he seems to trust you.

84
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,750
You know Chu Mo well too.

85
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:18,980
We grew up together.

86
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,120
I treat him as my brother.

87
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,100
He only treats me as his sister too.

88
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:25,740
By the way,

89
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,820
have you read the news?

90
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:31,080
It's karma.

91
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:33,550
It's a pity

92
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,710
that our drama

93
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:36,560
can be suspended for the time being.

94
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,620
Do you really think it's coincidental karma?

95
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,340
Could it be Chu Mo?

96
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,880
With our current status,

97
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,170
we're not able to do that.

98
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,390
It's him.

99
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,570
The director of "Stuck with You"

100
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:55,940
has such a big scandal.

101
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,860

the box office

104
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,410
is going to be a disaster.

105
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:04,180
Mr. Han, you insisted on investing

106
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,550
tens of millions of yuan in it.

107
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,040
Consequently, the group's stock has fallen continuously.

108
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:09,510
This can't go on.

109
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,880
Find a way to calm things down.

110
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,740
It's the hidden rule of the industry.

111
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:14,990
We're all used to it.

112
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,010
That's right.

113
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,120
Whitewash the director

114
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,510
and Dongsheng won't be implicated.

115
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,920
At this rate, what's going to happen to Dongsheng?

116
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,330
That's the only way.

117
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,150
We have to plan for

118
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,370
what to do next.

119
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,170
Please be quiet.

120
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,260
Whoever wants to whitewash that scumbag

121
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,360
can leave Dongsheng.

122
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:30,640
I'll take your shares.

123
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:31,960
Mr. Han,

124
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,750
you can't say that.

125
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,920
We're doing this for Dongsheng Group.

126
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,270
There's no need to suffer such a great loss

127
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,159
because of a director.

128
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:43,540
If Dongsheng couldn't get through this,

129
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:46,180
I wouldn't be sitting here.

130
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,230
No more discussion.

131
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:50,270

You're discharged?

137
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:12,590
Well.

138
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,320
I have something to tell you.

139
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,120
-I'm sorry.
-Thank you.

140
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,000
-Why are you thanking me?
-Why are you sorry?

141
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,700
Thank you for doing whatever it takes

142
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,310
to bring that man to justice.

143
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,350
I should be sorry.

144
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:32,820
I failed to protect you.

145
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:34,920

146
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,200
Can you forgive me six years ago?

147
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:40,770
Of course not.

148
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:42,750
But

149
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,760
I can forgive you now.

150
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,760
You said

151
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,120
we should look forward.

152
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,850
So can you accept me again?

153
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,700
I want to protect you

154
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:58,740
and Kele.

155
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:00,490
I...

156
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,360
Hello, Chu Mo.

157
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,170
Did you find out about the red-haired man?

158
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,000
Okay.

159
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,980
Okay, I'll be right there.

160
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:27,580
Donglai.

161
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:28,930
Actually, six years ago…

162
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:30,150
I know.

163
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,840
How could you do this?

164
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,960
I just wanted Zhong Ling to leave.

165
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,990
I thought you didn't like her either.

166
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,330
But you couldn't instigate others

167
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,630
to do rape.

168
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:46,040
I know I was wrong.

169
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,409
I just wanted to make her suffer.

170
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,950
The director ruined everything.

171
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:52,140
Ma'am.

172
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,690
If he tells me out,

173
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,600
I'll be doomed.

174
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:55,770
Please help me.

175
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:56,790
Please help me.

176
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,450
The scandal of the director

177
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,410
involves Dongsheng Group.

178
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,750
I guess

179
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:08,210
Donglai

180
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:09,560
ordered someone

181
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,240
to expose his evil deeds.

182
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,620
I didn't expect

183
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:13,340
Donglai

184
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,380
to care so much about Zhong Ling.

185
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:17,980
I know.

186
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:20,130
That's why I came to you.

187
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,700
As long as Donglai

188
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:22,410
doesn't track it down,

189
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:22,870
I…

190
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:24,000
I'll be fine.

191
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,470
All right.

192
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:28,160
I'll ask Donglai to come home for dinner

193
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,820
to see how far he wants to go.

194
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:34,000
-Thank you, ma'am.
-It's all right.

195
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:34,429
Here.

196
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:35,230
Thank you, ma'am.

197
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:37,130
Thank you, ma'am.

198
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:42,380
What's wrong?

199
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:44,530
Young Master.

200
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:50,230
When I found that the red-haired man and Lin Xiaxi were dating,

201
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:51,830
I sent someone to keep an eye on him.

202
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:54,030
So why did he come here today?

203
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,840
You asked me to look into the people who came in and out of the mountain on that day 6 years ago.

204
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:57,790
Among them,

205
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,540
he was the only one who had two criminal records.

206
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,160
I'm still working on it.

207
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,920
But I didn't expect him to come.

208
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,010
Does he want money?

209
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:05,870
Yes.

210
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:07,160
He knows

211
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,970
if the case is overturned, he'll expect severe penalties.

212
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,570
So he wants to take the money before turning himself in.

213
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,660
Where is he? I want to see him.
