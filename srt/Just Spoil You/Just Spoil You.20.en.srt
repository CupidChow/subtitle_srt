4
00:00:58,290 --> 00:00:58,690
See?

5
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,540
I told you it wouldn't be lost.

6
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,550
Forget it.

7
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:09,930
It wasn't there when I was looking for it.

8
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,560
What's the point

9
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:12,920
of showing up now?

10
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,750
Wait for me.

11
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:16,789
After I'm done packing up,

12
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:17,900
we'll go out for lunch.

13
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,600
I gave this to Zhong Ling.

14
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:40,470
In the past,

15
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,240
I always saw Zhong Ling staring at it alone.

16
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:46,630
I realized how important this necklace was to her.

17
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:49,210
I know

18
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,870
you can only solve the burden in your heart by yourself.

19
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,090
Zhong Ling and I are both orphans.

20
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,390
So I can feel the pain of being abandoned by my parents.

21
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,420
It makes us feel extremely insecure.

22
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,720
We always want to wrap ourselves up tight,

23
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,480
but we're afraid of hurting the people we care about around us.

24
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:16,110
That's why Zhong Ling is so afraid of Kele being taken away by others,

25
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,200
including you.

26
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,260
She's afraid that approaching you again

27
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:22,990
will make her a target

28
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:24,800
and hurt her again.

29
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,350
All right.

30
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,700
I've said everything I need to say.

31
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,180
Zhong Ling and Kele will leave Jiangcheng at 3 p.m. tomorrow.

32
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,570
I can't do what you need to do.

33
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,120
Think about it.

34
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,170
I'm leaving.

35
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:20,110
Your mom will blame me if we run out like this.

36
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:22,090
She doesn't allow us to be together.

37
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,670
It's okay.

38
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,910
At worst, I won't go home.

39
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,470
Hey, Young Master.

40
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,510
Do you know how much we orphans

41
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:29,880
envy you kids with families?

42
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,410
How can you not care about your family?

43
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,670
Alright.

44
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,510
I'm just saying.

45
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,350
You're such a good daughter-in-law.

46
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:38,380
Of course, my mom will like you.

47
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,210
What daughter-in-law? Don't say that.

48
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:43,500
Sooner or later you will be.

49
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,410
Sit still.

50
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,520
The bus will be leaving soon.

51
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:53,720
What's wrong?

52
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,190
Nothing.

53
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,090
The seat is a bit hard.

54
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,430
Rich kids like you should join us

55
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,340
to experience the hardships of the world.

56
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,510
It's good

57
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,680
to experience it with you.

58
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,440
Do you like flying, Kele?

59
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,630
Yes.

60
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:22,840
Come on.

61
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,690
Mom, I don't want to leave.

62
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,750
Kele, be good.

63
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,400
I miss Uncle Han.

64
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,140
Kele, be good. We'll be back.

65
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,290
We'll miss the flight if we don't leave now.

66
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:38,050
Hug me, mom.

67
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,670
-Open the door with bottoms.
-Open the door with bottoms.

68
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,890
What's wrong, Kele? Aren't you happy we're going back to An'nan?

69
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:12,570
Yes.

70
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,850
But I miss Uncle Han.

71
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,840
I want to go back with Uncle Han.

72
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,930
Uncle Han is very busy.

73
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:20,790
Come on.

74
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:21,570
Let's sit down first.

75
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:22,210
Here we are.

76
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:22,890
Here.

77
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:39,900
Thank you.

78
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,620
Please take your seats.

79
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:48,470
Okay.

80
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,450
Kele, sit still.

81
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,200
Why are you here?

82
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:04,530
We can just

83
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:05,870
start over.

84
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:11,260
Uncle Han, I knew you wouldn't ignore me.

85
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,760
Don't call me uncle anymore.

86
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:14,140
Call me Dad.

87
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,320
Really?

88
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:16,240
Mom.

89
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,720
Uncle Han has agreed to be Kele's dad.

90
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,300
I knew you were my dad.

91
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,440
Kele is so smart.

92
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:25,690
By the way,

93
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,370
why didn't Chu Mo come to see you off?

94
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,450
He was going to.

95
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:30,640
But you

96
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,550
invited the famous director, Wang Fan,

97
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:34,659
to continue filming "Stuck with You",

98
00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:36,659
so Chu Mo was trapped in the crew.

99
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:42,600
I only see Chu Mo as my brother.

100
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,170
I know.

101
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:48,690
You forgot this.

102
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,460
Mom's necklace.

103
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,659
Put it on for me.

104
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,060
Okay.

105
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,600
You're such a good boy.

106
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:59,900
Don't take it off

107
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:00,750
without my permission.

108
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,270
-Yes, Young Master.
-Yes, Father.

109
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,070
Cut.

110
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:12,220
Very good.

111
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:13,370
Happy wrap!

112
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:15,490
Thank you.

113
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:16,200
Thank you.

114
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,940
I heard that Han Donglai was going on a honeymoon with Zhong Ling.

115
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,190
What's your plan?

116
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:21,730
I plan to take a break

117
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:22,960
at the beach.

118
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:25,150
Okay.

119
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:27,210
Hey.

120
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:28,700
Do you want to come along?

121
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:31,610
Sure.

122
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,130
Let's go.

123
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,270
Come on.

124
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,200
Let's go, Kele. Let's go have the cake.

125
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,440
Wait.

126
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:46,900
