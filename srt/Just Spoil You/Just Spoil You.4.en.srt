"Stuck with You"

00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,800
is a multi-million-yuan drama project invested in by the Dongsheng Group.

6
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,000
As the male lead,

7
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,680
you've been outed in an illegitimate child scandal.

8
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,230
Do you know how much that will affect the promotion?

9
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,300
This child is not Chu Mo's.

10
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:09,990
If we

11
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,610

12
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,550
Zhong Ling having a child before marriage

13
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,210
and Chu Mo just giving her some sympathetic help

14
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,300
out of pity for her,

15
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,920
I think the fans will be on Chu Mo's side.

16
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:22,120
No.

Kele is not an illegitimate child.

20
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,730
Since people are so concerned about my relationship with Zhong Ling,

21
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,330
why don't we just announce it?

You're the author.

27
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:39,820
You should be at the press conference.

28
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:41,930
But those entertainment reporters

29
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,640
will hold onto our scandal.

00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,940
I don't want Kele to see me on TV.

31
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,910
It's because of the scandal

32
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,650
that you should be there with us.

33
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,630

Don't take facts out of context

How do you explain who's the father?

78
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:43,530
Will Dongsheng Group terminate the contract or withdraw the investment?

Mr. Han Donglai, the younger director of Dongsheng Group?

88
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,110
I repeat,

89
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,400
For the project "Stuck with You",

90
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,750
not only will we not withdraw our investment,

91
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,060
but we'll invest more money to build it.

92
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,570
We're also looking forward to movie star Chu Mo's interpretation of the role.

93
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,140
What about the clarification of the scandal?

94
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,240
Dongsheng Group attaches great importance to this project.

95
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,850
So we specially invite the original author Ms. Zhong Ling

96
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,320
to participate in the project

97
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,330
and give guidance to the creators,

98
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,090
so that they'll know more about comic characters.

99
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,740
So the contact between Ms. Zhong and Mr. Chu

100
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,610
is completely for work.

101
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,030
So the scandal...

102
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,540
What scandal?

103
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:40,620
If anyone dares to spread rumors again

104
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,710
and reflect badly on the main creators,

105
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,590
causing damage to the project,

106
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,280
Dongsheng Group

107
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,180
will hold him accountable.

108
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,460

109
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:55,830

110
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:57,970
Mr. Han.

111
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,700
Didn't you say you'd give up the copyright of this comic?

112
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,590
The scandal between a movie star and a mother cartoonist

113
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,210
has been trending for a week.

114
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,530
It's such a hit.

115
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,010
We even saved money on pre-promotion.

116
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,550
This is a good deal for Dongsheng.

117
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,340
How can we waste it?

118
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,420
Anyway, thank you.

00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,170
Zhong Ling and I

120
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,850
have to thank you for this.

121
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,610
I think since Mr. Han explained this,

122
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,380
the entertainment news will stop.

123
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:28,440
Position yourself.

124
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,260
I'm not helping you.

125
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,080
Since it's already hot enough,

126
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,940
let's call it a day for this affair.

127
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:37,490
Wait.

128
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,520
You push it.

129
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:41,470

130
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,120
Ms. Zhong, do you have a problem?

131
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:51,850
Please step aside.

132
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:01,420
Take care, Mr. Han.

133
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:04,270
Zhong…

134
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,190
What are you still calling her?

135
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,480
If it weren't for Mr. Han,

136
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,420
you'd be doomed.

137
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,550
I didn't ask him for help.

138
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:10,830
You and Zhong Ling

139
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,110

140
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,160

when you knew Chu Mo,

144
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,760
I'll give this yummy candy to you.

145
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,220
OK?

146
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,150

Didn't we meet at Uncle Han's company?

152
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,370

153
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,590

00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,070
Let me tell you.

156
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,240
Uncle Han is my fiancé,

157
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:48,230
not your father.

158
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,310
Bad aunt.

159
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,070
Kele, look what I bought for you.

160
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:53,990
Kele.

161
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:58,340
Mom, I don't like this bad aunt.

162
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,560
Kele, be good. Mommy is here.

163
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:01,470
Don't be afraid.

164
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:03,580
Kele,

165
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,870
can you go downstairs and play with me?

166
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:07,930
Kele.

167
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,490
Go play with your sister.

168
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,940
I'll come to you later, okay?

169
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:11,950
Okay.

170
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:12,910
Be careful.

171
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:25,380
Nice environment.

00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,050
Donglai arranged it?

174
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,700
Or did Chu Mo do it?

175
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:31,830
None of your business.

176
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,409
We are old friends.

177
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,490
I should visit

178
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:37,750
when your child is sick.

179
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,050
He's such a cute kid.

180
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,630
It'd be a pity

181
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,159
if he died early.

182
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,070
I came back just to treat my son.

183
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,830
What about your promise six years ago?

184
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,430
You said you'd never see Donglai again.

185
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,490
You promised me six years ago that you would cure Donglai.

186
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,330
Why is he still in a wheelchair?

187
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,160
It was just an accident to see him again.

188
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,120
I don't want anything to do

190
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,000
or you.

191
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:09,940
You'd better think so.

192
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,320
Otherwise,

193
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:13,170
your cute son

194
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,570
will be in danger…

195
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,140
Zhong Ling.

196
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:17,160
I'm warning you.

197
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:18,840
You can do whatever you want to me.

198
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,580
If you dare do anything to my son,

199
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,430
I'll fight you to death.

200
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,720
Zhong Ling, how dare you!

201
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,470
-Six years ago... -Six years ago?

202
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:25,780
Let me ask you.

203
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,710
You asked me to go to the mountains. Why was I the only one there?

204
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:29,410
Why was it such a coincidence that I was locked in the house too?

205
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,030
Donglai got hurt because of that.

206
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,909
You and Dong Lai grew up together.

207
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,299
How could you bear to see him become disabled?

208
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,419
No, I...

209
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,690
I just wanted you to die.

210
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:38,000
I didn't mean to harm Donglai.

211
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:39,270
I just wanted you to die.

212
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,299
Donglai…

213
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:43,640
It's really you.

214
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:47,890
So what?

215
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:49,320
Would anyone believe you?

216
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:51,090
I've been with him for six years.

217
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,740
It's me.

218
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,440
Donglai is mine.

219
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,850
What's mine is mine

220
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,130
even if it's rotten or broken.

221
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,450
Don't try to steal it from me.

222
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,640
Don't worry, I won't expose you.

223
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,300
I came back this time

224
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,640
to live a normal life with my son.

225
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,180
As long as you don't bother me,

226
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,960
I won't expose you.

227
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,050
You should leave.

228
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:20,330
Let me remind you.

229
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,740
There must be traces of what you did.

230
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:25,020
The truth will come out

231
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,350
sooner or later.
