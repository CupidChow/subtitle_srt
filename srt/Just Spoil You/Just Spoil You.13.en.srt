Grandma.

5
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:59,110
Are you here to see Kele?

6
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:00,690
Who's your grandma?

7
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:01,570
You.

8
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,690
Uncle Han's mother is my grandma.

9
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:08,180
Come here. Let me tell you a secret.

10
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,710
Uncle Han agreed to be my dad.

11
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:13,110
Nonsense!

12
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,630
How could my son be your father?

13
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,680
Did your mother teach you to acknowledge a father just anyhow?

14
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,230
Did she?

15
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,880
I'm not lying.

16
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:21,810
I'm not a bastard.

17
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:23,100
Bad grandma!

18
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,690
Go away!

19
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,830
Shut up!

20
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,500
Remember,

21
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:29,310
Donglai is not your father,

22
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,900
and I'm not your grandma, either.

23
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:31,320
You...

24
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:32,530
Why are you crying?

25
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,870
Look how your mom has taught you.

26
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,830
Don't talk about my mom.

27
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,340
I hate the bad grandma.

28
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,380
Go away!

29
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,360
Bad grandma?

30
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,410
I asked for humiliation myself.

31
00:01:59,050 --> 00:01:59,509

00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:00,280
Hello, sir.

00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:01,620
I'm going to the Provincial Hospital.

Hey, you two.

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,550
This is my taxi.

It's 11 p.m.

38
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,199
I wonder if Kele is asleep.

39
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:13,910
Mom.

40
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,150
Mom.

41
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:17,870
I am a man. I won't cry.

00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,190
Sister nurse,

43
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:20,930

00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:58,630
Give it to me.

49
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,250
It's Kele from bed 52.

50
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:03,580
Yes, it's me.

51
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,170
Little Kele,

52
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,720
why are you out again without your shoes on?

53
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,280
Take out the needle first.

54
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,030
Why weren't his parents there for him?

55
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,130
I'll remove it.

56
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,880
Let's go back to the ward, okay?

57
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:16,850
Okay.

58
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:21,910
-Thank you, Sister angel.
-Kele is such a sweet guy.

59
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,110
Sit up.

00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:28,310

62

Can I skip it?

63
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:33,560
No.

64
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:34,710
Don't be afraid.

65
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,320
Little Kele, where are your parents?

66
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,390
Mom went to work.

67
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:39,950
It's okay.

68
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:40,990
I'll keep you company.

Yes.

71
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:47,610
All right.

72
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,550
Parents nowadays are so irresponsible.

73
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:52,590
They just want to make money and don't even care about their kids.

74
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,400
My mom didn't ignore me.

75
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,290
She loves me the most.

76
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:01,100
She works so hard.

00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,790
I am already a young man now.

78
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,130
I'm not afraid of injections.

When I recover,

80
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,560
I will take care of my silly mom.

81

Why are you so cute, young man?

82
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,420
Little Kele, what about your dad?

83
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,019
I want a dad too.

84
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,290
That way,

85
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:24,070
I can share some of the men's burdens.

86
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,130
Which young man was afraid of injections just now?

87
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,890
That didn't count.

88

Fine, that didn't count.

89
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,010
I'll keep it a secret for you.

91
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:52,740
Everything went well.

92
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:53,760
It'll be finished soon.

93
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,950
It's just that Ms. Zhong has been working hard lately.

94
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,470
She has to follow the crew

95
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:02,660
and take care of Kele at the same time.

96
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,830
Has Kele been discharged?

97
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:07,790
Yes.

98
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,180
He's already in kindergarten.

99
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,000
He's also registered in after-school programs.

100
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,110
But the shooting time is not fixed.

101
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:13,160
Do you think

102
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,150
we should tell the director

103
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,460
to cut Ms. Zhong some slack?

104
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:17,770
Okay.

105
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:19,490
Forget it.

106
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:22,010
After all, this is her personal matter.

107
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:24,330
Fine.

108
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,370
You have a problem?

109
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:29,840
I dare not.

110
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:31,870
I'll leave now.

111
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:44,710
Ms. Zhong.

112
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,420
Come to my room at 9 p.m.

113
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,680
Mr. Liu.

114
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:50,440
Zhong Ling.

115
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,580
I have something to tell you.

116
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,390
I'll come to you after work tonight.

117
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,170
The director said he wanted to see me.

118
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,000
I'll go to his place first.

119
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,050
I'll call you when I'm done.

120
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,060
Okay.

121
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,010
-Wait for me.
-Are you ready?

122
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:02,350
Coming.

123
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:06,620
Director.

124
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,620
Ms. Zhong, have some water.

125
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,370
Thank you, Director.

126
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:19,710
Is there a problem?

127
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,520
There's something wrong with this part.

128
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:24,140
Director, you can't change this part like this.

129
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:25,640
If we change it like this,

130
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,540
the depressive image of the heroine will no longer stand.

131
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,610
And the later emotions are not coherent anymore.

132
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:30,520
Here.

133
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:31,700
Where?

134
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:34,650
Sorry, Director.

135
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,740
I have something to do tomorrow.

136
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,460
I have to go.

137
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:43,050
What did you give me?

138
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,020
The medicine of love, of course.

139
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,630
I've been coveting your talent for a long time.

140
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,150
Let's have good communication tonight.

Where are you going?

145
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:11,510
Stay back!

-I've never played with a woman who's given birth.
-Let go!

147
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,260
Let go of me!

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,280
Let's see where you can go today.

149
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,360
Don't come over.

150
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,760
Don't come over!

151
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:25,040
You wish to run?

152
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:26,910
Help!

153
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,700
I'll be gentle to you.

154
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:30,400
Good girl.

155
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:33,900
You bitch!

156
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,490
I've played with all kinds of celebrities.

157
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,500
Who are you, a stupid scriptwriter, to resist me?

158
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,270
Scream?

159
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,220
I'll see how you can scream now!

160
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:58,190
Director.

161
00:07:59,020 --> 00:07:59,840
I'm Chu Mo.

162
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,100
That jerk!

163
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:02,960
Director.

164
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:03,940
Chu...

165
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,030
Chu Mo!

166
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,290
Director, this is Chu Mo.

167
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,060
If you don't want to die,

168
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,350
just shut up.

169
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,250

Hello?

171

Chu Mo.

172
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,150
I'm in bed.

173
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,430
If there's anything,

174
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,860
let's talk tomorrow.

175
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:23,880
Okay.

176
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,710
Then where's Zhong Ling?

177
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:32,820
Chu Mo.

178
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,270
Chu Mo, help me!

179
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:35,330
It's Zhong Ling.

180
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:36,130
How dare you set me up!

181
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:36,630
Zhong Ling!

182
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:42,610
Stop hitting me!

183
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,390
Stop hitting me!

184
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,290
Stop hitting me!

185
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:48,900
Zhong Ling.

186
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:50,540
It's okay.

187
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:51,290
Let's go.

188
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,450
Let's go.

189
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,090
Chu Mo and Ms. Zhong?

190
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,510
What happened to Ms. Zhong?

191
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,570
She was drugged.

192
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,750
