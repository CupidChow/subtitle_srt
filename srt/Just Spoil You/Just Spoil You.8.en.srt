00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,640
Han Donglai, president of Dongsheng Group

5
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,720
is rumored to be married to Lin Xiaxi, the daughter of the president of Ren'ai Hospital.

6
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:03,650
It's said that they grew up together.

7
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:04,379
Mr. Han…

8
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,410
Uncle Han, when are you coming back?

9
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:09,990
Kele misses you.

10
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,880
Soon. Kele, be good.

11
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,270
You promised to be Kele's dad.

12
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,890
Don't regret it.

13
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,080
Be good then.

14
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:18,180
Okay.

15
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,850
Cola, come out.

16
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:23,320
Kele and Uncle Han will both be good.

17
00:01:23,539 --> 00:01:24,440
Mom is calling me.

18
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,000
Bye.

19
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,420
Kele, look who's here.

20
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:28,920
-Chu Mo.
-Kele.

21
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:33,670
Have a seat.

22
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,789
You haven't visited me and Mum for a long time.

23
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:41,979
Do you miss me?

24
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,320
Of course.

25
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,680
This is a gift for you.

26
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:47,750
Do you like it?

27
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:48,960
Yes.

28
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,020
Go play.

29
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,210
Be careful.

30
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,000
Are there many paparazzi outside?

31
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,390
Don't worry.

32
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,940
Besides, the project "Stuck with You" is about to start.

33
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,850
We have to get close to work.

34
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:06,310
Okay, cut.

35
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,310
Very good.

36
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,280
You guys are pretty good at interpreting the psychology of your characters.

37
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,700
Ms. Zhong, what do you think

38
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,830
from the original author's point of view?

39
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,280
Just call me Zhong Ling.

40
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:18,520
It's great to be able to watch a movie queen and a movie star

41
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:19,400
perform live.

42
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,260
Thank you.

43
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,110
Director,

44
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,650
I have a question for the original author.

45
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,090
At Scene 10:5,

46
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:34,650
the male and female lead just started living together,

47
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:35,770
and they

48
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,540
touched each other's faces.

49
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,280
I thought about it.

50
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,710
It was the first time she'd been in a relationship

51
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,710
since she went blind.

52
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:45,890
So should she be happy and blissful

53
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,300
or not entirely trusting him?

54
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,360
According to the setting of the comic,

55
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,650
the female lead should be happy.

56
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,220
After all, the male lead was the first person

57
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,600
she wanted to believe since she went blind.

58
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,380
But the male lead was struggling inside.

59
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,540
He faced the person he loved

60
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,520
and always reminded himself that he was a sinner.

61
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,510
The emotions

62
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,070
are hard to control.

63
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,020
Can you try this part, Ms. Zhong?

64
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:09,730
Sure.

65
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,740
No.

66
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,890
I can't act.

67
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,860
It's okay.

68
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,860
-Yes.
-You know the character better than us.

69
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:16,890
I just want to gauge the emotions of the characters

70
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,290
from the audience's perspective.

71
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,460
-Yeah, try it. -No.

72
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:19,940
Try it.

73
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:20,660
You can do it.

74
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:21,590
Come on.

75
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:22,329
Try it.

76
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,020
Okay then.

77
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,730
These are your eyebrows.

78
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:41,770
These are your eyes.

79
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,200
This is your nose and mouth.

80
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:48,900
My turn.

81
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,520
Xiaomei.

82
00:03:58,450 --> 00:03:59,600
I will marry you this time.

83
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,040
I promise you.

84
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,350
I will marry you

85
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,650
and protect you.

86
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,560
You can't go back on your word.

87
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,220
Bravo.

88
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:14,770
Why don't we let Ms. Zhong

89
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,149
be our team consultant?

90
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,079
Sure.

91
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,760
It's for a better presentation of "Stuck with You".

92
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,620
I believe Ms. Zhong won't refuse.

93
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,860
Okay, I can do it.

94
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,380
-Okay, let's continue.
-That's amazing.

95
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:29,580
-In the last part, the two of them made up.
-You're flattering me.

96
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,270
-Let's take a look at the script before discussion. 
-But you’re good at flirting.

97
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,850
No wonder so many female fans are crazy about you.

98
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:36,300
Were you tempted then?

99
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,540
Be serious. Read the script.

100
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,120
Let's get in.

101
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:50,930
Mr. Han, you are here.

102
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,630
I can report the progress to you.

103
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,490
Today is the reading meeting for the male and female leads.

104
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:55,680
She?

105
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:57,300
Let me introduce.

106
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,310
This is the original author of our comic.

107
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:00,870
I'm asking

108
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,130
why she is here.

109
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:05,370
Ms. Zhong just accepted the role of script consultant.

110
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:06,860
She'll follow the whole project.

111
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:08,580
Okay.

112
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,190
Replace the male lead.

113
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:11,680
-Why?
-Why?

114
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,720
Mr. Han, this won't do.

115
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,630
We'll start filming in a few days.

116
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,540
And Chu Mo

117
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,080
is the best candidate for this role.

118
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,080
How can we change the male lead now?

119
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,540
So, I can't replace him?

120
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,060
Yes.

121
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:24,680
Okay.

122
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,600
Mu Chen, make arrangements.

123
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,660
Replace the director too.

124
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,180
Yes.

125
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:29,300
Mr. Han, how…

126
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,020
Why don't you change me too?

127
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,050
Mr. Han.

128
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:33,810
Long time no see.

129
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,080
Long time no see.

130
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,690
Say hello to Auntie Han for me.

131
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,640
Let's not catch up.

132
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:39,720
Back to the point.

133
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,650
As the most potential male artist in our company

134
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:45,100
and also the best leading actor who just won the Golden Ball Award,

135
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,230
Chu Mo's acting skills

136
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,310
are undeniable.

137
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,720
Second,

138
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:49,790
the contract has been signed.

139
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,830
Even if Dongsheng Group can afford the penalty,

140
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,470
you've hyped the project with Chu Mo's scandal,

141
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,560
it's not appropriate to do so now, is it?

142
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,360
You should know

143
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,080
it's useless to threaten me.

144
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,760
I know.

145
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,290
But Mr. Han,

146
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,830
you should at least

147
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:08,830
be nice to your neighbor, shouldn't you?

148
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:17,630
Director,

149
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,880
why don't we call it a day

150
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:20,710
for today's reading?

151
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:21,470
All right.

152
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:21,910
OK.

153
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,220
That's all for today.

154
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:24,860
You all need to hurry up and prepare.

155
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,630
Mr. Han,

156
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,250
thank you for taking care of Zhong Ling and Kele these days.

157
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:39,750
Let's go.

158
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,390
What happened

159
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:45,560
is much better

160
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,490
than in the drama.

161
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:47,870
I admire

162
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,100
your connections too.

163
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,320
Behave yourself.

164
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,690
It's no good to go against

165
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,070
the investors.

166
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,380
Wait.

167
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,070
Bring Zhong Ling here.

168
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:00,890
Yes.

169
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:08,740
Mr. Han,

170
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,120
stop interfering with my work.

171
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,980
Don't forget who you work for.

172
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:12,600
You...

173
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,320
Then fire me too.

174
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,570
How can you pay my rent

175
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,340
and the money for Kele's treatment?

176
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:23,710
I...

177
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,570
Drive.

178
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:26,980
Where are you going?

179
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,820
I don't have to replace Chu Mo,

180
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,870
and you don't have to pay the rent.

181
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,000
What do I have to trade for it?

182
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:38,670
Take off your clothes.

183
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,140
Take off my clothes?

184
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,490
Put this on and come with me.

185
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,010
Now?

186
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,610
Should I get changed in the car?

187
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,520
The driver is a woman.

188
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:56,830
I won't look at it either.

189
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:01,690
Fine.

190
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:02,890
You've seen it anyway.

191
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,640
You're so casual.

192
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,160
If I weren't, I wouldn't have given birth to…

193
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,710
Long time no see.

194
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:17,980
Where have you been recently?

195
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,620
It's none of your business.

196
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:25,760
You're a fast learner.

197
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,530
I'm very happy

198
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:33,860
to have you attend my birthday banquet.

199
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:34,940
Please.

200
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,270
You look good today.

201
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,280
-And you're getting prettier.
-Thank you.

202
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,290
Happy birthday, Mrs. Xu.

203
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:55,950
Xi

204
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,700
is getting prettier.

205
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,070
All thanks to my parents

206
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:01,960
for raising me well.

207
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,600
Silly girl.

208
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:05,730
Well,

209
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,230
I'll have to ask you to take care of her for me.

210
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,620
It depends on

211
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,140
whether she's willing to listen to me.

212
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:13,680
Yes, I am.

213
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,380
I'll be good.

214
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,220
Why

215
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:20,570
haven't I seen Donglai?

216
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:22,850
He should be on his way.

217
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:24,250
What kind of occasion is this?

218
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,170
Why are there so many people?

219
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,270
It's my mom's birthday party.
