[Episode 19]

4
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,770
Don't you know what happened?

5
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:02,570
You know

6
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,010
Kele is your son.

7
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,910
If my mom hadn't done the DNA test,

8
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:09,740
would you have kept it from me forever?

9
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:11,070
No.

10
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,160
I was going to tell you.

11
00:01:13,289 --> 00:01:14,720
I wanted to tell you today.

12
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,890
I asked you many times about this.

13
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:18,990
But every time you said

14
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:21,580
he was not related to me,

15
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:22,680
and he was not my son.

16
00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:28,180
How could you be so cruel?

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,900
You disappeared for 6 years,

18
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,560
and then showed up with my son

19
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,780
but denied his identity.

20
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:37,410
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:39,680
I was just too scared.

22
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,620
I was afraid you would take
Kele away because you hated me.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,750
You know it,

24
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,259
he is the only family I've got.

25
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:47,690
So you could take away my rights as a father?

26
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:52,800
These two days,

27
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,610
every time I thought about

28
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,030
that I told him not to call me dad,

29
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:00,430
but uncle.

30
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,950
I felt ridiculous.

31
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,980
I let my son call me uncle.

32
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,669
Zhong Ling, how can you watch

33
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:12,640
your son call his father uncle?

34
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,280
Have you ever thought about Kele?

35
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,810
Don't you know how much he wants a father?

36
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:20,300
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,100
I was so scared.

38
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,400
I was afraid you would take him away.

39
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:27,079
I can't live without Kele.

40
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:29,110
You?

41
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,560
You're still drawing a line with me.

42
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:38,700
Six years ago,

43
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,150
you left me without thinking about my feelings,

44
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,260
even if I begged you.

45
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,260
Six years later,

46
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,100
you tried to take my son to avoid me,

47
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,030
and you didn't think about my feelings as well.

48
00:02:55,329 --> 00:02:56,860
Do you think you're doing this for my good?

49
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:57,920
For Kele's good?

50
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:00,660
In fact, you're just doing it for yourself.

51
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,340
No.

52
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,290
I just want all of you to be fine.

53
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:05,940
Isn't it good now?

54
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,840
Let's start over, Donglai.

55
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,830
Have you ever thought about

56
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,570
how can I forgive your deception in the past 6 years?

57
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,400
♫All the sweet memories were left on the street corner♫

58
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:25,160
♫And returned to the wind♫

59
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:24,880
Han Donglai.

60
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:29,700
♫There's just enough empty pride left♫

61
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,190
♫Perfect, let it follow you♫

62
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,200
♫And melt away while walking♫

63
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:40,700
♫The firework we casually set off back then♫

64
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:40,790
You are too selfish.

65
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:47,650
♫It was gorgeous as if it was persuading me to stop here♫

66
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:53,870
♫Like the equator waiting for snow and the waves waiting for sand♫

67
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:56,590
♫Love is waiting to be let go♫

68
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:03,790
♫Can we meet again after saying goodbye?♫

69
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:05,730
Son.

70
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:06,710
What did she say?

71
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,400
Donglai.

72
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:09,760
Zhong Ling

73
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:10,790
suffers a lot.

74
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,260
She was taking care of Kele alone,

75
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:16,120
should we understand her?

76
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:18,260
Besides,

77
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,610
what should we do

78
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,190
if we annoy her and she leaves with Kele?

79
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,180
No. No.

80
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,670
We must talk to her.

81
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,020
Mom,

82
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,130
You were the one who asked me to leave her.

83
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,190
Now you're the one who wants me to forgive her.

84
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,560
It's because of my grandson.

85
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,630
You are quite like Zhong Ling.

86
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,070
You always trying to manipulate me
with righteous words.

87
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,470
You're not going?

88
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:44,680
Fine.

89
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,440
I'll talk to her.

90
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:47,670
Mom.

91
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,270
I'll say it again.

92
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:50,680
You don't get to

93
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,530
make that call.

94
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:54,700
Donglai.

95
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,080
Dong...

96
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:02,300
Hello.

97
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,390
I'm here to see Mr. Han.

98
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:06,850
Sorry, Ms. Zhong.

99
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,020
Mr. Han went out for a meeting.

100
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,080
Please

101
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,260
give this to him.

102
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:15,940
Okay.

103
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,430
Thank you.

104
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,590
Have you prepared the meeting materials?

105
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,130
Yes.

106
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:29,810
Okay.

107
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,210
Make sure nothing goes wrong today.

108
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:31,670
Okay.

109
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:34,300
Mu Chen.

110
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,200
Ms. Zhong.

111
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:36,909
You go first.

112
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:37,240
Okay.

113
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,480
I haven't seen Donglai for several days.

114
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:41,790
Is he okay?

115
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:43,490
Ms. Zhong.

116
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,040
You should go back first.

117
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,050
Got it.

118
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,810
I'll ask the driver to send you back.

119
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:58,200
No need.

120
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:08,850
Young Master.

121
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,010
Ms. Zhong comes here every day.

122
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,370
Avoiding her

123
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,230
is not going to work.

124
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,120
Got it.

125
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,320
Brother Chu Mo, my god.

126
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,960
Mom is crazy.

127
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,420
Zhong Ling.

128
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,120
Mom.

129
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,740
Brother Chu Mo is here.

130
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,250
Why are you here?

131
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:20,700
What are you doing?

132
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:22,470
Looking for something.

133
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,350
The necklace Donglai gave me is missing.

134
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:27,170
Kele,

135
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:28,790
play in the room, okay?

136
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,070
OK.

137
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:41,850
Chu Mo,

138
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,370
I can't find the necklace Donglai gave me.

139
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,210
I don't remember where I put it.

140
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,159
It's okay.

141
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,640
Let's look for it together, okay?

142
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:50,930
It won't be lost.

143
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:52,159
It won't be lost.

144
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,450
Uncle Han,

145
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,110
why didn't you answer Kele's call?

146
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:01,340
kele needs Uncle Han.

147
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,810
Mom always cries.

148
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:06,170
When is your flight?

149
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:07,370
Tomorrow.

150
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,200
Have you decided?

151
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,850
Aren't you going to tell Kele?

152
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,360
Kela is still young. He won't understand.

153
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:22,520
When he gets older, I'll tell him,

154
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:24,340
and let him choose.

155
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:28,230
You're going through so much,

156
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,690
finally there is no obstacle,

157
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,210
why do you have to give up now?

158
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,280
It's all my fault.

159
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,289
I was too selfish and willful.

160
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:41,620
I understand that Donglai can't forgive me.

161
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:44,480
Maybe this leaving

162
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,960
will make us think more clearly.

163
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:52,210
Fine.

164
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,730
I support your decision.

165
00:08:59,260 --> 00:08:59,700
Look.

166
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,490
I told you it wouldn't be lost.
