4
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,010
I came back this time
just to take Kele to see the doctor.

5
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,220
Isn't it because of Chu Mo?

6
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,160
I'll leave then.

7
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,959
I'll give you another chance.

8
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:08,580
Stay by my side.

9
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:13,050
Mr. Han,

10
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,810
I think I’ve made myself clear.

11
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:16,690
I don't want to get involved with
the Han family anymore.

12
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,210
I don't remember

13
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:19,880
what happened in the past.

14
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:21,990
What?

15
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,130
Do you think I'm disabled?

16
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:26,350
I'm not as good as a strong young man.

17
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,520
Or he's better at something.

18
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,480

Let go of me!

25
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,440

♫Destined to rain with a vengeance♫

27

Absolutely not.

70
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,400
I've had a lot of scandals.

It'll be over soon.

00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,980
It is different this time.

73
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:42,630
You'd better tell me the truth.

74
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,820
Otherwise, when the paparazzi
find out the information about the girlfriend,

75

I have something to do.

80
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,870
Fine. Okay.

81
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:56,960
You are busy.

82
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,390
You're the busiest one in the world.

83
00:03:58,410 --> 00:03:59,990
I'll leave.

84
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,710
Listen,

85
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:05,510
you need to be low-key these days.

86
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,450
Got it.

87
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:12,540
Hello?

88
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:13,820
Where are you?

89
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:16,170
Okay.

90
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:17,149
I'll go find you.

91
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,320
What's the rush?

92
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:31,610
Kele is still in the hospital.

93
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,590
I've asked my assistant to take care of Kele.

94
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,460
Why?

95
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,120
Did something happen?

96
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,310
There are many paparazzi
at the gate of the hospital.

97
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:46,200
We were photographed secretly.

98
00:04:46,659 --> 00:04:48,020
I'm afraid you can't handle it.

99
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:50,990
Let me send you home.

100
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,159
Donglai.

101
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,190
Don't you know how to knock?

102
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,270
Come on.

103
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,180
I'm sorry.

104
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:05,020
I was too excited after hearing
Chu Mo's gossip.

105
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:06,440
Donglai,

106
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:07,810
did you see that?

107
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,330
Zhong Ling and Chu Mo

108
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,190
were photographed.

109
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,600
Zhong Ling is really something.

110
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,320
She can hook up with a superstar

111
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,200
at such an age.

112
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,560
Maybe her son

113
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,260
is Chu Mo's son?

114
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,320
The illegitimate son of a superstar?

115
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,160
With a five-year-older sister?

116
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,920
If such a big gossip comes out,

117
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,060
Chu Mo

118
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,680
will be ruined.

119
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,630
This will ruin his reputation

120
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:41,320
and he has so many endorsements.

121
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:42,890
It's gonna be a huge loss for his company.

122
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:45,580
But

123
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,360
the new project Dongsheng Group invested

124
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,500
signed him as the leading actor.

125
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,020
Donglai,

126
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,530
do you think

127
00:05:56,409 --> 00:05:57,920
we should control the media

128
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,530
and help him and Zhong Ling?

129
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,950
Since they dare to do it,

130
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,350
they shouldn't be afraid of being exposed.

131
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,030
If I can't have her,

132
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,570
no one can.

133
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,620
You live in such a place?

134
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:23,480
What?

135
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:24,800
You become a superstar,

136
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,610
so you look down on our mansion.

137
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:27,910
No.

138
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,460
I just think

139
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:33,159
I've already found a better place.

140
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,510
But you...

141
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,300
We're here to see a doctor,

142
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:37,450
not to travel.

143
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:38,560
Besides,

144
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,590
we used to be happy

145
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,850
when we lived in grandma's small house.

146
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:44,060
You're right.

147
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,409
Sister Zhong Ling.

148
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,530
I miss my grandma.

149
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:52,870
You haven't called me sister for a long time.

150
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:56,980
-I’m sorry.
-The necklace.

151
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:58,530
Stop!

152
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,610
Where is my necklace?

153
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:01,350
Where is my necklace?

154
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:04,990
Stop!

155
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:07,680
Auntie.

156
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:09,530
Mind your own business.

157
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,020
I just called the police.

158
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:13,520
And I recorded a video.

159
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:14,850
If you need anything,

160
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:15,830
tell the police.

161
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:17,500
You're lucky.

162
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,270
Are you okay?

163
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:29,050
Thanks.

164
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,770
My necklace.

165
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,040
Wake up.

166
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:51,200
Wake up.

167
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:04,470
Where am I?

168
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:05,800
The hospital.

169
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:06,620
Can't you tell?

170
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,070
You...

171
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:15,870
The necklace.

172
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:16,900
Where is my necklace?

173
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:17,940
Where is the necklace?

174
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,390
Pregnant woman need to
pay attention to your emotions.

175
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,460
-You’re too excited. It’s bad for the baby.
-Pregnant woman.

176
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:22,580
Who said that?

177
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:23,820
No way.

178
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,590
They checked.

179
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:27,160
Can't you tell?

180
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,570
How could this happen?

181
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:32,630
How could this happen?

182
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,700
It's getting late.

183
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,450
Go upstairs.

184
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,270
It's not convenient for me these days.

185
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:44,740
Okay.

186
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,650
You drive safe.

187
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:57,270
Okay.

188
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:57,910
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

189
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:03,660
You...

190
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,150
I said you it was you.

191
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:07,070
It's not me.

192
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,440
It is you.

193
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:09,890
Why don't you admit it?

194
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,060
Look at you,

195
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,390
you're in love with a superstar.

196
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,200
Why are you still staying here?

197
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:16,020
Oh,

198
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,450
did he dump you?

199
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:18,600
Look at you.

200
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,640
He's so rich,

201
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,400
why don't you ask for some breakup fees?

202
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,070
I'm not done yet.

203
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,270
Bah!

204
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,500
You're so arrogant.

205
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,640
Just a dumped woman.
