00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,110
Wasn't the one that had a paternity test

5
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,490
Zhong Kele, who was treated in our hospital?

6
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:02,680
So,

7
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:03,870
the result shows that

8
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,840
he is related to Donglai?

9
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:06,990
They're father and son.

10
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,360
Didn't you see it?

11
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:13,450
I asked Dr. Lin's daughter to bring the result to you that day.

12
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:17,050
Yes.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,039
Thank you, Director Zhang.

14
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,330
You're welcome.

15
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,610
I'll get going then.

16
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:23,539
I have to work at the Outpatient Department today.

17
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,120
Goodbye, Director Zhang.

18
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:25,800
Bye.

00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,730
Lin Xiaxi.

20
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:32,070
Should we tell Young Master

21
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,800
that Kele is his son?

22
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:37,720
Let me think on it.

23
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:39,940
When Donglai recovers,

24
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,520
I'll tell him personally.

25
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:42,710
Okay.

26
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:43,840
Let's go.

27
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:46,160
How is it?

28
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:47,580
He's still running a fever.

29
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,570
It's normal to have a fever after the surgery.

30
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:50,539
Try physical cooling.

31
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:51,550
Okay.

32
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,660
Thank you, nurse.

♫I opened my eyes and had this dream♫

34
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,229
♫Where it was like we'd never met♫

35
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:15,120
♫All the sweet memories were left on the street corner♫

36
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,880
♫And returned to the wind♫

37
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:22,520
♫There's just enough empty pride left♫

38
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,810
♫Perfect, let it follow you♫

39
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,000
♫And melt away while walking♫

40
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:33,329
♫The firework we casually set off back then♫

41
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:40,430
♫It was gorgeous as if it was persuading me to stop here♫

42
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:46,590
♫Like the equator waiting for snow and the waves waiting for sand♫

43
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,340
♫Love is waiting to be let go♫

44
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,630

51
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:21,560
Don't go.

52
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:22,820
Don't go.

53
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:23,350
I'm here.

54
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:24,740
I'm here.

55
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,350
Can you hear me?

Ling.

57
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,670
Please don't leave me.

58
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,630
Don't leave me.

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,730
Donglai.

60
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,820
Please don't leave me.

61
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:42,780
Donglai.

62
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:43,970
I'm not leaving.

63
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,400
I won't leave anymore.

64
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:49,890
I'm sorry.

65
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:52,810
I'm sorry.

66
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:55,590
I'm sorry. I won't leave you anymore.

67
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,190
Sorry, Donglai.

68
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,030
I won't leave anymore.

69
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,350
But can you wake up soon?

70
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,180
Please wake up.

71
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,440
Can you wake up?

72
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,450
Do you know how much I've missed you in the past 6 years?

73
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,250
But I didn't dare to come back.

74
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,560
My parents died because of me when I was little.

75
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:26,680
When I grew up,

76
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:29,850
you also experienced misfortunes because I was close.

77
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,990
I was really scared.

78
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:37,760
I was really scared that people around me would all leave me.

79
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,650
What should I do?

80
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:45,690
What on earth should I do?

81
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:49,180
Can you wake up soon?

82
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,110
Donglai.

83
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,630
Donglai, you're awake.

84
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,300
You scared me to death.

85
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,550
Silly girl.

86
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,390
I'll get you some water.

87
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,270
Don't go.

88
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,520
You just said

89
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,430
you've been missing me

90
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:35,120
for the past 6 years.

91
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,090
Is that true?

92
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,900
Which grandma is looking for me?

93
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,520
Look.

94
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:19,560
Kele.

95
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:20,970
I'm here to pick you up.

96
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,020
Kele.

97
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,070
Kele, what's wrong?

98
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,370
Don't you recognize your grandma?

99
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:26,520
Bad grandma.

100
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,770
She's a bad grandma.

101
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:30,040
Kele, be good.

102
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,990
I was wrong before.

103
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,230
Kele, be good.

104
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:34,990
Look.

105
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:36,270
Look what grandma brought you.

106
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,210
A toy car.

107
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,170
I don't want it.

108
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,180
You're not my grandma.

109
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,730
Kele.

110
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:44,500
Ke…

111
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,420
Have some chicken soup while it's still hot.

112
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:54,520
I'll do it myself.

113
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,460
I'll be discharged soon.

114
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,150
No.

115
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:57,210
The doctor said

116
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,380
it's bad for your wound if you move around.

117
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:09,190
By the way,

118
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,260
Xiaxi...

119
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,510
The police are taking care of it.

120
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:18,150
Zhong Ling.

121
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,250
Let's start over.

122
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,220
Don't worry about Kele.

123
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,510
I won't ask you again

124
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:37,780
about the things you didn't want to answer.

125
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,400
I'll treat Kele as my own son.

126
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:42,260
Oh.

127
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,550
It's not because of this.

128
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,659
And Kele is actually…

129
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,330
How could I tell him the truth?

130
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,890
Will he blame me for denying that Kele was his son the whole time?

131
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,150
I'll tell him later.

132
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:54,890
What is it?

133
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:56,870
Nothing.

134
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,230
Kele likes you the most.

135
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,790
Uncle Han.

136
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:08,870
Be careful.

137
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,600
Uncle Han hasn't recovered yet.

138
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:11,640
Got it?

139
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,360
Uncle Han.

140
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,170
Does it still hurt?

141
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:16,930
No.

142
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,110
He insisted on visiting Uncle Han.

143
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:22,240
I can't dissuade him.

144
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:26,330
Thank you for taking care of Kele these days.

145
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:27,690
Thank you for the flowers.

146
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:30,900
Why are you being so polite?

147
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,400
It's like we're not close.

148
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,260
Look.

149
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,480
This is a gift Brother Chu Mo and I

150
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:39,690
picked for you together.

151
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:40,740
Hey, you brat.

152
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,480
You call him uncle, but you call me brother?

153
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,090
Am I of the same generation as you?

154
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,690
-I don't want to be your uncle.
-Yeah.

155
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:48,760
How dare you!

156
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,340
Come here.

157
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,660
Slow down, you two.

158
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,080
-This is the hospital.
-Come here.

159
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,270
Alright.

160
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:57,180
Stop it.

161
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:04,710
Mu Chen.

162
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,770
Where are Donglai and the others?

163
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,540
Isn't he supposed to be discharged today?

164
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:10,710
Madam.

165
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,270
He was dragged to their home by Kele.

166
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:16,250
I'll pick them up.

167
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,130
Madam.

168
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:18,810
It's getting late.

169
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,340
Young Master said he'd be back tomorrow.

170
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,230
He said you could rest assured.

171
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,050
Okay.

172
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,070
I'll pick them up tomorrow.

173
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,590
Madam.

174
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:27,480
Rest early.

175
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:37,080
Kele is not a bastard.

176
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,190
Bad grandma.

177
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,930
Go away!

178
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,160
Remember,

179
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:42,720
Donglai is not your father.

180
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,900
I'm not your grandma, either!

181
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:45,370
I hate bad grandma.

182
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,750
-Go away! Go away!
-Kele still doesn't acknowledge me.

183
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,360
I have to tell Donglai about Kele's identity as soon as possible.

184
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,400
I must bring my grandson back.
