[Episode 14]

4
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:01,200
How is Zhong Ling?

5
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:02,410
She just had her stomach pumped.

6
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:03,720
She's resting.

7
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:06,250
How could this happen?

8
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:10,720
Does this have anything to do with you?

9
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:13,120
Are you crazy?

10
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,260
How could I hurt Zhong Ling?

11
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:16,610
Really?

12
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,560
You've hurt her a lot.

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,730
♫I opened my eyes and had this dream♫

14
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,920
♫Where it was like we'd never met♫

15
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,320
Ever since she met you,

16
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,880
she's never been happy.

17
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,380
♫You held his arm, had long hair♫

18
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,680
You know you can't give her happiness.

19
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,330
You gave up once 6 years ago.

20
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:34,729
♫And loved to smile more than before♫

21
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:35,380
Why did you bother her again?

22
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,470
♫All the sweet memories were left on the street corner♫

23
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:39,830
Six years ago,

24
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:43,229
♫And returned to the wind♫

25
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,789
it was her that gave up on me.

26
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:47,960
♫There's just enough empty pride left♫

27
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:47,670
What about you?

28
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:50,250
♫Perfect, let it follow you♫

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,990
You said I can't give her happiness.

30
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,860
As a superstar,

31
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:54,400
♫And melt away while walking♫

32
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,060
can you give her a life as a normal person?

33
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:58,759
♫The firework we casually set off back then♫

34
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:03,220
♫Blossomed into an afterglow that permeated the city♫

35
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,540
Maybe neither of us deserve her.

36
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:10,250
♫It was gorgeous, as if it was persuading me to stop here♫

37
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:16,430
♫But there's no snow near the equator, and clouds don't have a home♫

38
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:19,110
♫I'm not him♫

39
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:18,620
Donglai.

40
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,090
♫The world is too big and I'm too small♫

41
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,550
Donglai, save me!

42
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:21,040
Zhong Ling.

43
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:21,610
Donglai.

44
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:22,960
Donglai.

45
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,180
♫I can't walk through all the loneliness, passing from place to place♫

46
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:25,920
I'm here.

47
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:34,090
♫Like the equator waiting for snow and the waves waiting for sand♫

48
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,010
♫Love is waiting to be let go♫

49
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,960
Why does my life become a mess

50
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,470
every time I meet you?

51
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,720
Han Donglai.

52
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,240
You are my bad luck.

53
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:44,270
♫Can we meet again after saying goodbye?♫

54
00:02:55,110 --> 00:03:00,870
♫Like the equator waiting for snow and the waves waiting for sand♫

55
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:03,920
♫Love is waiting to be let go♫

56
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:11,400
♫It's getting dark, time to forget each other♫

57
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,860
Boss, are you hurt?

58
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,190
Get lost. Leave me alone.

59
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,600
Zhong Ling.

60
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,350
I don't believe you can be so lucky every time.

61
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:41,840
Emm.

62
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:42,470
Nice.

63
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,160
Why are you looking for me?

64
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,750
Someone found out what happened 6 years ago.

65
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,800
I need to hide abroad for a while.

66
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,010
After all,

67
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,240
attempted murder

68
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,340
is a serious crime.

69
00:03:59,210 --> 00:03:59,790
How much do you want?

70
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,260
One million.

71
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:08,800
I'll pay you tomorrow.

72
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:10,420
Don't contact me again.

73
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,080
Ten million.

74
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,100
What?

75
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,000
How dare you?

76
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,490
After all, I'm not familiar with the place

77
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,280
and I don't understand the language.

78
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,100
I have to think about the rest of my life.

79
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:29,750
I don't have that much.

80
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,409
You're just a running dog.

81
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,760
Why do you think I would spend so much money

82
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:38,690
to raise a useless dog?

83
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:40,380
By the way,

84
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:43,380
you're not the only running dog I have.

85
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,520
After tonight,

86
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,250
no one will compete with me.

87
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:50,560
You?

88
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,340
You'll all be useless.

89
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:56,110
Miss Lin.

90
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,659
I have to remind you.

91
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,360
It hurts a lot

92
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:01,840
when dogs bite people.

93
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:07,000
Get lost.

94
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,630
After tonight,

95
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,190
I don't believe

96
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,930
Donglai will still want this piece of junk.

97
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,100
I'll protect you.

98
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,290
I won't let anyone hurt you.

99
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,140
What's wrong?

100
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,150
Don't touch me!

101
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,460
-Don't come over.
-I'm Chu Mo.

102
00:05:39,409 --> 00:05:39,940
Chu Mo.

103
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,140
Chu Mo.

104
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:42,490
Chu Mo, that director...

105
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:43,430
Nothing happened.

106
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,510
Get some rest.

107
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:49,440
Oh no.

108
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:50,360
Kele.

109
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,550
What about Kele?

110
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,150
My assistant is taking care of Kele.

111
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:54,270
Don't worry.

112
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,530
Thank you.

113
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:01,890
If you hadn't arrived in time,

114
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:03,620
I would have...

115
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,560
Monster.

116
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,150
I won't go easy on him.

117
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:14,270
Don't worry.

118
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,110
I'm fine.

119
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,060
You're still in the crew.

120
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,480
You have to think for yourself.

121
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,360
That's what happened last night.

122
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,340
Monster.

123
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:32,370
This director indeed has a bad reputation in the industry.

124
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,850
But how dare he lay a finger on Zhong Ling?

125
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,800
Everyone in this crew can more or less tell

126
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,990
that Zhong Ling has a special relationship with Mr. Han.

127
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:43,909
I also find it strange.

128
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,810
Director, I added a few words to this scene.

129
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,670
What do you think?

130
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,070
Very good.

131
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:51,980
Director, have some water.

132
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:54,040
Alright, get ready.

133
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:54,890
Action.

134
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,200
Director.

135
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,130
Alright, get ready.

136
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:58,940
We're ready.

137
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,659
We...

138
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:00,330
Where are the actors?

139
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,240
Where are the actors?

140
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,350
Why aren't the actors in position yet?

141
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,060
Cameras' are rolling!

142
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:03,660
Chu Mo!

143
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:05,020
Hero and heroine, hurry up!

144
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:05,910
Hurry up!

145
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,860
-Everything's ready.
-Don't be angry, director.

146
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:11,580
Go arrange it.

147
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,570
But Dongsheng Group invested a fortune.

148
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,230
I'm afraid

149
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,810
Dongsheng Group will be implicated by this.

150
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,660
Just do as I say.

151
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:29,160
Chu Mo.

152
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,380
We'll talk later.

153
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:37,930
You have to hold back.

154
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:38,610
Don't be impulsive.

155
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:41,290
Let's go.

156
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,680
Act 18, scene 2, take 3.

157
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,270
Stop it.

158
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:52,880
Assistant!

159
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:54,500
Are you okay?

160
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,050
What happened? Did I say cut?

161
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,810
Who told you to stop?

162
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,130
The prop is wrong. The water is boiling hot.

163
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,640
Scum!

164
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:02,630
Hold it back.

165
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,000
It's okay.

166
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:06,700
He's the director.

167
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:09,300
If this gets out, it'll only be a titbit.

168
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:10,500
It's no good for Zhong Ling

169
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,870
or the box office.

170
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:26,670
Fortunately, it's hot water,

171
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,030
not sulfuric acid.

172
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,660
Have you ever

173
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,460
touched Zhong Ling?

174
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:34,530
Let me tell you.

175
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,309
The size

176
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,179
and the feel

177
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:37,909
of her breasts

178
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,100
are just perfect.

179
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,340
They're out of the world.

180
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:47,380
Come on.

181
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,260
Come on.

182
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,120
Go on.

183
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:51,940
Go on!

184
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,580
A popular superstar puts on airs

185
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:57,890
and beats up the director.

186
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,680
Let's see how you're going to continue your career.

187
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:08,810
Playing with me?
