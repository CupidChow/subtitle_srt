00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,810
May Madam Han stay young forever.

5
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,700
Thank you.

6
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,690
With so many friends attending my birthday party,

7
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:03,870
as an old woman,

8
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,200
I feel content enough.

9
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:06,850
What old woman?

10
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,620
Your skin is better than mine.

11
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:09,530
Have you forgotten?

12
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:10,900
Last time when we went shopping,

13
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,530
people thought we were sisters.

14
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,430
This girl…

15
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,730
Xiaxi is such a sweet talker.

16
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:20,650
That's why it's better to have a daughter.

17
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,270
You two are so lucky.

18
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,720
Unlike my son,

19
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:27,870
he's even late for my birthday party.

20
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,150
Our little daughter

21
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,070
will soon be yours, too.

22
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:32,820
Mom!

23
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:33,930
Yes.

24
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,240
Miss Lin and Young Master Han are a perfect match.

25
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,150
Today two happy events come in pairs.

26
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:40,150
Yes.

27
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,110
Two happy events.

28
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,390
-Two happy events.
-Two happy events.

29
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,680
Two happy events.

30
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:45,509
Donglai.

31
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,100
What kind of occasion is this?

32
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:49,160
Why are there so many people?

33
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,110
My mom's birthday party.

34
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,160
What?

35
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:55,930
Keep pushing.

36
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:01,880
Who is this woman?

37
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,600
She's so pretty.

38
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,630
I heard that the Han family is going to announce the engagement with Lin Xiaxi today.

39
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:07,160
Why did Young Master Han

40
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,570
bring a woman here?

41
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,620
It's going to be fun.

42
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:15,430
What took you so long?

43
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:17,430
Hello, Dr. Lin.

44
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,300
Hello, Mrs. Lin.

45
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:19,770
Mom.

46
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:20,820
Happy birthday.

47
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,950
This is the birthday gift Zhong Ling and I prepared for you.

48
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,390
Happy birthday, Madam Han.

49
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:28,370
Why did you bring her here?

50
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,880
Didn't you ask me to show up with a date

51
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,250
at the birthday party?

52
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,170
So I brought a date.

53
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,030
What about Miss Lin?

54
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:36,610
Didn't you bring one?

55
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:38,700
Madam Han,

56
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,380
what is going on?

57
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:42,230
Mom.

58
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,440
Mr. Han, today are you going to announce your engagement

59
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,030
with Miss Lin

60
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,110
or this lady?

61
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:49,390
What do you think?

62
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,880
There is no engagement to be announced.

63
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:52,590
I'm sorry.

64
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,790
Please enjoy the buffet over there.

65
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:54,800
But Mr. Han…

66
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,360
This way, please.

67
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,280
You, too. This way, please.

68
00:02:58,940 --> 00:02:59,710
Auntie.

69
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,740
Is this how the Han family

70
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,970
treats Xi?

71
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,560
Oh, I remember now.

72
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,760
Six years ago, for her,

73
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,460
Donglai canceled the engagement with Xi,

74
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,330
which was made before they were born.

75
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,270
Dr. Lin, Mrs. Lin.

76
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,410
I'm sorry.

77
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,670
-Donglai…
-I never agreed to marry Lin Xiaxi.

78
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,370
How can you accuse me of rejecting her?

79
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:26,510
Donglai,

80
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:27,840
you've gone too far.

81
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,180
Xi.

82
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:32,590
Madam Han,

83
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,350
do you want to give us an explanation?

84
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:36,079
Well...

85
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,240
Auntie.

86
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:45,800
Happy birthday.

87
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,940
Manli.

88
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,460
We haven't seen each other for so many years.

89
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,970
You've grown up.

90
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,640
I'll visit you more often.

91
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,160
Don't lie to me.

92
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:54,950
I won't.

93
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:56,990
You guys continue.

94
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:58,510
Zhong Ling.

95
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,370
Let's go grab something to eat.

96
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,130
Sure.

97
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,630
I didn't know this would happen.

98
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,560
Don't worry. I'm on your side.

99
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:13,880
Thank you.

100
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,740
Dr. Lin, Mrs. Lin.

101
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:17,910
About today's incident,

102
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:19,550
I will give you an explanation.

103
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:21,950
Forget it.

104
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,320
We'll take our leave now.

105
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,330
Are you going against me on purpose?

106
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:33,970
It's you that are going against me.

107
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,440
Have something to drink.

108
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:40,110
Thank you.

109
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,060
Ms. Zhong.

110
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:45,760
Can we talk privately?

111
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:49,860
Go ahead.

112
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,480
No matter what your relationship with Donglai is,

113
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,520
the Han family has proposed marriage with Xi.

114
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,610
I hope you can be self-dignified from now on.

115
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:03,910
Dr. Lin, you don't have to threaten me

116
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,480
just like threatening a patient.

117
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,570
What do you mean?

118
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,590
As a doctor, I at least have the basic medical ethics

119
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,430
as not to threaten patients.

120
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,580
Really?

121
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:16,330
Six years ago…

122
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,340
Six years ago when Donglai was injured, I rushed back overnight for the operation.

123
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,210
I tried my best to keep his legs.

124
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:24,680
My conscience is clear.

125
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,190
But you…

126
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,490
You left at such a convenient time.

127
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,610
Dr. Lin doesn't seem to be lying.

128
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:34,240
What?

129
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,510
Why aren't you talking?

130
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,640
Excuse me.

131
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,860
I have something to do. I have to go now.

132
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,760
What are you doing here?

133
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,940
The Han family's birthday banquet causes a scene in the whole city.

134
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:01,780
I'm here to join the fun.

135
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,720
Is this outfit suitable?

136
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,680
I told you

137
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,060
not to show up in front of me in public.

138
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,190
You did this on purpose!

139
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,400
Yes, I did.

140
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,640
Why didn't you answer my calls these days?

141
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:15,810
By the way,

142
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,460
I'm the one who helped you deal with that nosy journalist.

143
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:20,730
Miss Lin,

144
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,670
-aren't you even going to thank me?
-I didn't ask you to do it.

145
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:24,690
Oh, right.

146
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,030
Donglai is investigating it.

147
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,540
You'd better be careful.

148
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:31,640
So you're going to dump me?

149
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:47,640
Who is that man?

150
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,330
I'm locked up.

151
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,750
Can you help me?

152
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:05,530
Hello?

153
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:06,810
Chu Mo,

154
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,110
you have to do me a favor.

155
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,280
Six years ago, I gave you a huge sum of money.

156
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,580
You promised to make Zhong Ling disappear.

157
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:17,960
Did you succeed?

158
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,550
I asked you to destroy her and Chu Mo.

159
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,580
Did you succeed?

160
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,300
You can't even handle a little landlord.

161
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:29,420
Useless!

162
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:36,430
Useless?

163
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,940
I said to kill her straight away back then,

164
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:40,850
but you didn't dare.

165
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,130
You insisted on creating some kind of accident.

166
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,590
Don't try to put me in jail.

167
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,320
Investigate?

168
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,200
Let them investigate then.

169
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,760
You did everything anyway.

170
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,640
It has nothing to do with me.

171
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,159
At worst,

172
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,610
you can go in again.

173
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,040
It's not your first time behind bars anyway.

174
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,070
I'm not your slave.

175
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:08,650
Listen.

176
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,670
If I go to jail again,

177
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:13,020
I will take you with me.

178
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,090
How dare you!

179
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,200
Don't make me.

180
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,580
Get out!

181
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:26,910
Get out!

182
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,710
You're all bullying me.

183
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,700
I'm not that easy to bully.

184
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:34,590
Jerk!

185
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:35,860
You're all jerks!

186
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,440
This is

187
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,330
the Lin family's private club.

188
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,610
Uncle Han is here.

189
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:02,520
I miss you so much.

190
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:03,990
I miss you, too.

191
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:04,980
Kele, come here.

192
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:05,770
Play with the toy.

193
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,020
Why didn't you tell me when you left?

194
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,490
What's there to say?

195
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,000
I'm just a tool.

196
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,100
Mr. Han, you're already engaged to Lin Xiaxi.

197
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,550
Why are you still holding on to me?

198
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,550
Uncle, are you engaged to the bad aunt?

199
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,420
Don't interrupt when adults are talking.

200
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,650
Got it.

201
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,420
I just came back from abroad yesterday.

202
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:28,820
My mom

203
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,520
arranged the engagement without telling me.

204
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:32,480
It has nothing to do with me.

205
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,130
Uncle.

206
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,490
You made mom angry.
