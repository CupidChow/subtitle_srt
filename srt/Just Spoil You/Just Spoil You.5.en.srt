4
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,630
Tangyuan.

5
00:00:58,660 --> 00:00:59,890
Hello, Aunt Zhong.

6
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:00,480
Good girl.

7
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:01,620
Where's Kele?

8
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,400
Kele is playing downstairs with the helper.

9
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:06,130
Look.

10
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:07,750
Helper?

11
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:10,600
It's him.

12
00:01:10,789 --> 00:01:11,830
Handsome Dad.

13
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,050
No.

14
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,160
It's still Uncle Han for now.

15
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,770
Uncle Han, let me tell you a secret.

16
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:19,510
What secret?

17
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,000
I'll be discharged tomorrow.

18
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,289
Can you come and pick me up?

19
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,320
Kele.

20
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:29,789
Mom!

21
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,620
You're running around again.

22
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,320
I went to get help for you.

23
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,140
How did you do that?

24
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,120
I called.

25
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,690
What did Xiaxi tell you?

26
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,050
Nothing.

27
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,370
She came to see her father

28
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,039
and we ran into each other.

29
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,250
What happened to your hand?

30
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,100
Nothing.

31
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:50,380
It's getting late.

32
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:51,460
Please go back, Mr. Han.

33
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,740
Kele and I won't bother you.

34
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,580
Mom, do you want to ride in a car?

35
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,600
A car?

36
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,430
Uncle Han's car.

37
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,560
-It's super fun.
-I'm sorry.

38
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:01,890
Uncle Han.

39
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:02,930
Start the car!

40
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:03,700
Kele, stop it.

41
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,310
Yes, sir.

42
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:05,940
Let me off.

43
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:09,280
Kele.

44
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,220
Go!

45
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,620
I've caught up with you!

46
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,830
See how fast I am.

47
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:15,390
You're smiling.

48
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:17,070
It's been 6 years.

49
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,840
I'm sorry, Donglai.

50
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:27,250
Get lost!

51
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,190
You can't do anything right.

52
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:31,920
Useless!

53
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:32,430
Use…

54
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,740
Six years ago,

55
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,110
you couldn't hold him off.

56
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,170
Now, because of that man of yours,

57
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:38,860
we failed.

58
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,970
If I weren't into your face and body,

59
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,570
with your little money,

60
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,680
how can you order me about for so many years?

61
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,650
-Let go of me!
-It's just a man.

62
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,500
Whatever that cripple can't give you,

63
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,920
I can give it all to you.

64
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,930
What do you think?

65
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:04,760
Miss Lin.

66
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:09,920
Don't move.

67
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:11,580
Tell me.

68
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,530
Do you want it or not?

69
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,760
Do you want it?

70
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:18,690
Am I right?

71
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:21,700
Beg me.

72
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:24,450
If Miss Lin begs me,

73
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:25,530
how dare I not listen?

74
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:26,730
Beg me.

75
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,090
Beg me! Beg me!

76
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,880
I beg you. Let me go.

77
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:34,640
Boring.

78
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,150
I know that woman's address.

79
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,850
I'll do as you say.

80
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,270
Boss.

81
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,880
Kele, hurry up.

82
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,000
It'll be dark soon.

83
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:06,200
Mom, can we wait a minute?

84
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:07,600
What's wrong?

85
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,950
Aren't you happy that you're discharged?

86
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,400
I want to wait for Uncle Han.

87
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:13,840
Kele.

88
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,440
I've told you many times.

89
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,839
Uncle Han is not your dad.

90
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,730
We can't always trouble him, okay?

91
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,829
Mom, don't be angry.

92
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,150
I know.

93
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,800
Let's go.

94
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:33,740
I decorated the new home for you.

95
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,190
You will surely like it.

96
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,010
Is there a big toy car?

97
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,150
-Of course.
-It's so dirty.

98
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,070
Ms. Landlord.

99
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:41,950
What are you doing?

100
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:42,780
Eek!

101
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,090
Don't come in!

102
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,420
Gosh! This kid!

103
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,220
What are you doing?

104
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,159
I'm telling you.

105
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,010
I'm not renting this apartment to you.

106
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:50,710
Leave now.

107
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:51,980
No way.

108
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,530
We signed a lease.

109
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,900
I'm in charge of my own apartment.

110
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:57,450
Go away!

111
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:59,340
You look decent,

112
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,390
but you're so indiscreet about your private life.

113
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,260
You hurt yourself.

114
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:01,980
And the bastard of yours

115
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,030
must have dirty disease, too!

116
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,260
What are you talking about?

117
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,950
I'm not dirty.

118
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,290
I'm very hygienic.

119
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,320
Kele.

120
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:09,870
Good boy.

121
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,770
Let's not listen to these bad guys.

122
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,930
Why are you wasting time talking to them?

123
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:16,050
Burn these dirty things!

124
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,020
Okay.

125
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:19,750
Don't come over.

126
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:20,690
You want to burn them?

127
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:21,070
Fine.

128
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:22,390
At worst we can die together.

129
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:23,640
It's your apartment anyway.

130
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:25,550
You bitch!

131
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,410
Are you okay?

132
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:32,220
Uncle Han.

133
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,630
Someone is bullying me and mom.

134
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,590
Don't be afraid.

135
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:37,650
Uncle Han is here.

136
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:38,650
Kele.

137
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:40,440
Are you hurt? Let me see.

138
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,390
Here comes a cripple.

139
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,970
Are you trying to show off?

140
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:52,480
There's no need

141
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:53,830
to keep your rotten tongue anymore.

142
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:54,820
Mu Chen.

143
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,140
What are you doing?

144
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,230
Let go!

145
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,140
He will die!

146
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,550
Come take a look, everyone! Help!

147
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,540
What are you shouting about?

148
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:06,860
Help!

149
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,190
Oh, please don't.

150
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,180
We signed a lease,

151
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,440
so we have the right to use the apartment.

152
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,120
Today, you trespassed

153
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,500
and damaged our property.

154
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:22,980
Just you wait for the subpoena!

155
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,160
Plus,

156
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,900
we don't want to live

157
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,260
in this dirty place anyway.

158
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:28,420
Kele.

159
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,450
I will take you out of here.

160
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,770
Are you okay?

161
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,010
Are you okay?

162
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,120
Let's go.

163
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,040
Forget it.

164
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:42,140
We have got rid of them anyway.

165
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:43,180
And we've got the money, too.

166
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,050
You talk too much.

167
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:46,770
Go inside.

168
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:52,290
Investigate this.

169
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:54,130
Yes.

170
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,080
Kele.

171
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:03,360
Do you want to go get the car with me?

172
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,370
Okay.

173
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:04,860
Go.

174
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:06,680
Ms. Zhong,

175
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:08,650
please take care of Young Master.

176
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,240
What?

177
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:27,790
You have nothing to talk about with me?

178
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,990
How do you know where we live?

179
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:32,900
I...

180
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,020
I forgot.

181
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,540
Young Master Han always has his ways.

182
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,640
I didn't expect that after so many years,

183
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,110
your life is still a mess.

184
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:46,870
You...

185
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,330
Why are your hands so cold?

186
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,480
Where is Kele?

187
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,120
I...

188
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,470
I'll go find Kele.

189
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,470
Today…

190
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,790
I have to thank you again.

191
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:13,990
No need.

192
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:15,490
I didn't do this for you.

193
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,090
I did it for Kele.

194
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,090
After all, Kele's father, Chu Mo, can't show up.

195
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,620
Poor kid.

196
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,480
Chu Mo is not Kele's father.

197
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,010
Then who is?

198
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,180
It's none of your business.

199
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,100
It's getting late.

200
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:30,810
I'll go…

201
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,490
Then tell me what my business is.

202
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,080
♫How long can I accept it after we're apart?♫

203
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,789
Or I don't even have the right to ask?

204
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:38,289
♫I can't empathize with you♫

205
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:37,929
Just like when you left 6 years ago.

206
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:42,570
♫You're like a match that lightens my future♫

207
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:42,830
It's been 6 years.

208
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:44,980
♫The sky has long been♫

209
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,730
We should both look forward.

210
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,410
I'm asking you who his biological father is.

211
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:49,310
♫Destined to rain with a vengeance♫

212
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,210
♫The most unserious tenderness in the past♫

213
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:50,110
Zhong Ling.

214
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,700
Why didn't I see it 6 years ago?

215
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,890
♫Has bloomed into the feelings of missing in the whole universe♫

216
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,480
You're so good.

217
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,400
You have men wrapped around your finger.

218
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,540
♫How can I fictionalize this?♫

219
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,900
You can even have a child

220
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,700
♫Only after we talk about the future will there be a future♫

221
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,240
without caring about who his father is.

222
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,770
Do you have to hurt me with such harsh words?

223
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:05,650
Am I wrong?

224
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:10,900
♫But there's no snow near the equator, and clouds don't have a home♫

225
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,260
Didn't you give birth to that child?

226
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,510
It has nothing to do with you.

227
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,740
♫I'm not him♫

228
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,940
It has nothing to do with me?

229
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:17,740
♫The world is too big and I'm too small♫

230
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,700
Do you think you can escape

231
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,020
all the reality with that sentence?

232
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,460
Then why are you homeless with your son?

233
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:22,980
♫I can't walk through all the loneliness, passing from place to place♫

234
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:19,970
Enough!

235
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,340
Stop criticizing my life

236
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,330
with that condescending attitude.

237
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:28,660
♫Like the equator waiting for snow and the waves waiting for sand♫

238
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:24,850
Han Donglai.

239
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:25,760
In the past 6 years,

240
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,120
Kele and I have been through

241
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,620
thick and thin together happily.

242
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:31,950
♫Love is waiting to be let go♫

243
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:30,330
Why does my life become a mess

244
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,850
every time I meet you?

245
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,170
Han Donglai,

246
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,460
you are my bad luck.

247
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:38,660
♫Can we meet again after saying goodbye?♫
