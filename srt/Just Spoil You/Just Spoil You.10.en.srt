00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:57,450
Uncle.

5
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,940
You made Mom angry.

6
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:02,540
Yes.

7
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:05,990
Do you know how to coax your mom?

8
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,610
I have an idea.

9
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,289
Uncle Han.

10
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,560
Mom draws in this album every time she's unhappy.

11
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,820
I've read it secretly.

12
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:29,740
Let me have a look.

13
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:47,350
Kele.

14
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:48,509
What time is it? Why are you still up?

15
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:49,210
Go wash up.

16
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:50,380
Okay.

17
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,050
Mr. Han.

18
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:55,950
You should go back...

19
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,320
My album!

20
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,370
You own it because you claim it?

21
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,250
The drawings in this are all of me.

22
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,190
It's not you.

23
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,030
Everyone has 2 eyes, 1 nose, and 1 mouth.

24
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,070
How can you say it's you?

25
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:10,440
There are many people that resemble him.

26
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,750
Who told you to rummage through other people's stuff?

27
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,100
What did you say?

28
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,860
I said it's our bedtime.

29
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,050
Young Master Han, please leave.

30
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,329
I'm not leaving tonight.

31
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,280
Why not?

32
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,480
Because I disobeyed my mother

33
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,430
and refused the engagement,

34
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:36,850
I was kicked out.

35
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:38,490
Oh.

36
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,320
Whatever.

37
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,440
No one sleeps in that small room anyway.

38
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,000
The filming will start tomorrow.

39
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,010
I'm going to bed.

40
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,650
Why are you smiling, Mom?

41
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,500
I'm not.

42
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:00,230
Come on.

43
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,410
Let me help you get changed.

44
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,840
Can you ask Uncle Han to share the bed with us?

45
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:06,890
No.

46
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,860
Time to sleep.

47
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:17,730
Let her go!

48
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:29,360
Stop!

49
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:29,880
Play it back!

50
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:35,440
Are you okay?

51
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:41,780
One more take!

52
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:42,670
Thanks, everyone!

53
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,290
Director.

54
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:47,960
We've had more than 20 takes of this scene.

55
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:49,100
Is there a problem?

56
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,620
The rhythm and emotions are not good enough.

57
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,960
Once more.

58
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,480
This part is not even in the script.

59
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,810
You're an actress.

60
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,850
Your only job is to read the script and act.

61
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,240
You're the investor.

62
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:04,210
It's inappropriate for you to boss around on set.

63
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,370
I'm just curious.

64
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:06,950
Are Dongsheng Group's people really so idle?

65
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,250
For the past half month,

66
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,760
Mr. Han, you've been on set every day.

67
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,720
Director, are we shooting now?

68
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:15,930
Thanks, everyone. One more take.

69
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,060
Where's the advisor?

70
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:19,560
Ms. Zhong, I have a question about the script.

71
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,450
-Ms. Zhong!
-I'm here!

72
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:21,660
What's wrong?

73
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,830
The advisor is not on set,

74
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,210
but the boss is directing the scene.

75
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,700
Sorry.

76
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,570
Mr. Han asked me to get some important documents.

77
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,080
Which scene is it now?

78
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:32,640
Chu Mo!

79
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:34,820
Chu Mo!

80
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,020
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

81
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,060
What's wrong with your waist?

82
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,470
I don't recall there's a fight scene in this part.

83
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,730
Did Han Donglai...

84
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:42,930
See?

85
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:44,490
Chu Mo is injured.

86
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:45,430
How can we shoot?

87
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,680
Three days off for the whole crew.

88
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:49,030
I'm fine.

89
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,120
-I'm fine.
-Okay. That's all for today.

90
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,990
Okay. Thank you, boss.

91
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,080
We've been shooting for only half a month.

92
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,659
Can't you just stay away from Zhong Ling?

93
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,100
At least wait until we finish shooting.

94
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,570
There's nothing untoward between Zhong Ling and I.

95
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:01,880
What's there to hide?

96
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:02,660
Indeed.

97
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,290
There's nothing untoward between Zhong Ling and you.

98
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,080
But she and Han Donglai...

99
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:09,590
Relationships can't be forced.

100
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,050
I can see that

101
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,140
Zhong Ling treats you

102
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,390
like her younger brother.

103
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,530
I know what to do.

104
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,820
May I come in?

105
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,030
Yes.

106
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,310
How is it?

107
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:23,330
Nothing.

108
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:24,330
You guys talk.

109
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:26,420
I'm going to take off my makeup.

110
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:27,590
Thank you.

111
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,300
I'm sorry.

112
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,470
It's not your fault.

113
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:35,550
Han Donglai wanted to cause me trouble,

114
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,690
so he dragged you into this.

115
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,130
Have you forgotten how we depended on each other to survive?

116
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,980
Don't say that.

117
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:41,650
Yeah.

118
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:43,030
I almost forgot if you hadn't reminded me.

119
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,820
This superstar at present

120
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,050
was once my little brother.

121
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,880
I'm not anybody's little brother.

122
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,040
Alright, you're not.

123
00:05:52,409 --> 00:05:53,950
You and Manli...

124
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,130
She's my senior,

125
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:57,420
but more of a friend to me.

126
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:59,210
I am who I am

127
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,660
mostly because of her promotion.

128
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:03,280
I treat her as my older sister.

129
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:04,670
Older sister?

130
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:05,800
Like me?

131
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:06,410
No!

132
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,430
I don't treat you as my older sister.

133
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:10,880
Zhong Ling.

134
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,390
To you, I...

135
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:12,900
By the way,

136
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,200
Kele's classes should be over now.

137
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,480
I'll go back to check on Kele first.

138
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,710
Take care of yourself.

139
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,260
Call me if anything happens.

140
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,570
Why are you following me?

141
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:28,290
To discuss the script.

142
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,300
How dare you talk about the script?

143
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,100
You wantonly changed it just because you're the investor.

144
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,580
That's my hard work!

145
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:34,810
Fine.

146
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,159
I won't change it then.

147
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,100
It's weekend.

148
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,240
I promised to accompany Kele.

149
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,920
I'm going to buy breakfast for Kele.

150
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,140
I haven't had breakfast, either.

151
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:47,670
Let's eat together.

152
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:49,090
Get in.

153
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:52,640
Is someone here?

154
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,340
Who is it?

155
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,540
Is this where Zhong Ling lives?

156
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:02,560
Yes. Mom went to buy breakfast. She's not home.

157
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,450
Can you open the door for me?

158
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:07,480
Mom told me

159
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:09,530
not to open the door for strangers.

160
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,630
I'm Han Donglai's mother.

161
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,000
Han Donglai's mother?

162
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,380
Then you're not a stranger.

163
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:31,320
Grandma, you're so pretty.

164
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,370
Are you Kele?

165
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:36,070
Yes.

166
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:37,659
Then tell me,

167
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,750
does Uncle Han often come to your home?

168
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,070
Kele, do you want a candy?

169
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,380
Yes.

170
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,400
Don't tell my mom

171
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:51,900
I ate a candy.

172
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,100
Okay.

173
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,260
Here.

174
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:58,330
Is it tasty?

175
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,380
Yes.

176
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:01,090
Good boy.

177
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,210
Then tell me,

178
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:05,700
does Uncle Han often come to your home?

179
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,460
Yes.

180
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:09,590
You're Uncle Han's mother,

181
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,890
so you can come here often, too.

182
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,140
This kid's eyebrows

183
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,770
are so similar to Donglai's when he was young.

184
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,000
Grandma.

185
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,290
Grandma.

186
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,310
How old are you?

187
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:28,620
I am 5 years old.

188
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,640
Which year were you born?

189
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:33,789
Which year?

190
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:37,070
Grandma, I feel dizzy.

191
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:38,520
Tell me when your birthday is,

192
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:40,159
-and I'll take you to eat something delicious.
-Kele!

193
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,130
Mom.

194
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:42,850
Kele.

195
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:44,530
Mom.

196
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:45,510
Why are you here?

197
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,070
This house belongs to the Han family.

198
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,630
Why can't I come?

199
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:50,740
Didn't I tell you

200
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,360
not to open the door when I'm not home?

201
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,790
But it's grandma.

202
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,470
What grandma?

203
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,270
You didn't behave again!

204
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,030
Enough.

205
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,680
Stop yelling at the kid.

206
00:08:59,240 --> 00:08:59,840
Madam Han.

207
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,680
The rent will be deducted from my salary.

208
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,350
I didn't live in the Han family's house rent-free.

209
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,710
Please don't disturb Kele and me again.

210
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:08,270
Kele!

211
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,090
Kele!
