162
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,630
he'd think of himself as a sinner.

163
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,430
She was blind because of his hit-and-run.

164
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,540

00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:08,840
-The writer...
-He'd taken a serious look at my book.

167
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:10,740

00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,210

169
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,640
I agree.

170
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,260

171
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,590

172
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:21,360

173
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,070
In the next part,

174
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,820
you can add some inner monologue.

175
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,100
Look at the dramatic tension here.

176
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:30,920

177
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:32,650

183
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:04,250
I need to go back to my son.

184
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,200
Doesn't Kele want to know who his father is?

185
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:06,970
He doesn't need to.

186
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,730
It's enough for Kele to have his mom.

187
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:15,800

190
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,580
The more I look at him,

191
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,890
the more he looks like Donglai when he was young.

192
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:35,900
Forget it.

193
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,010
The paternity test can't be wrong.

194
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,770
Grandma.

195
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,500
Are you here to see Kele?

196
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,700
Who's your grandma?
