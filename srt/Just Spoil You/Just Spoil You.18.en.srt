00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,510
what did you want to tell me in the car?

109
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:05,770
I wanted to say

110
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,210
Kele is your son and my grandson.

111
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:13,430
What did you say?

112
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,790
Kele is my son?

113
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,540
I didn't expect

114
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,680
that the result of the paternity test

115
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,870
would be swapped by Lin Xiaxi.

116
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:27,700
Now, Kele

117
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,760
is treating me like that,

118
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:31,700
could Zhong Ling taught him to do it?

119
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:35,930

120
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,760

121
00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:39,680
and refuses to let Kele claim us,

122
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:40,940
what should we do?

123
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:43,920
No way.

124
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,090
I don't care

125
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,950
what you will become in the future.

126
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:49,820
This is my grandson.

127
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,920
I must get him back.

128
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,040
He's the Han family's own flesh and blood.

129
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,010
How could Zhong Ling

130
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,460
keep us from claiming him?

131
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,120
Even though we misunderstood her before,

132
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,160
it was Lin Xiaxi's fault.

133
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,400
What does it have to do with us?

134
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,090

135
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:08,080

138
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,640
