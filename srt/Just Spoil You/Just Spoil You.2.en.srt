How can he know Ms. Zhong?

191
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,600
I'll go find out.

192
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,490
No one is following you, right?

193
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,680
Have you got the pictures?

194
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:27,670
Expose these

195
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:29,620
to the media.

196
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,030
Remember the payment.

197
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:41,330
Mrs. Han.

198
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:42,970
Got it.

199
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,810
I'm looking forward to having Ms. Zhong

200
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,910
participate in the adaptation of Stuck with You.

201
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:51,880
I'm also willing to participate.

202
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,660
Looking forward to working with you.

203
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:55,620
Here.

204
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,000
The president is waiting for you inside.

205
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,500
Okay, thank you.

206
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,370
Hello, I am...

207
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,290
Why are you here?

208
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,310
Because Tianyu Media has just been acquired by Dongsheng Group.

209
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,810
I came back this time only for Kele's treatment.

210
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,950
Isn't it for Chu Mo?

211
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,920
I'll leave if there's nothing else.

212
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:31,810
I'll give you another chance

213
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,380
to stay by my side.
