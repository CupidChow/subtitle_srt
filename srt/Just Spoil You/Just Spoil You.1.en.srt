What's your intention of bringing this kid back?

195
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,760
I brought him back just for his treatment.

196
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,670
We'll leave after he recovers.

197
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:31,590
Tell me.

198
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,500
Who is the father of the kid?

199
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:34,710
Let go!

200
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,360
Let go! It hurts!

201
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:39,409
What?

202
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,510
Are you trying to see

203
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:44,690
if my legs still have feelings?

204
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,160
No.

205
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,830
Or do you want to see

206
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,250
if a cripple still has sexual responses?

207
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:48,850
No.

208
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,680
No, Donglai.

209
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,270
Please let me go.

210
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,580
Please let me go. I'm begging you.

211
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,570
Begging me?

212
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,300
Six years ago,

213
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,520
when I begged you,

214
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,010
did you agree?

215
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,780
Emergency weather news.

216
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:04,640
[Six years ago]

217
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:05,570
A new round of storm sweeps across the south of our city.

218
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,990
There may be an avalanche in the Valley Mouth area.

219
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,680
The fire department has locked down the mountains.

220
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,190
What should I do?

221
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,300
-Anyone who goes outside, please be careful.
-I can't tell the direction of the forest.

222
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,080
It's cold.

223
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,150
I think I'm lost.

224
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:18,960
Ling!

225
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:21,420
Ling!

226
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,500
Where is the way down the mountains?

227
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:25,100
Where?

228
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:27,760
There's a house.

229
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:40,950
Ling!

230
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:42,890
Ling!

231
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,010
Hello?

232
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,550
I'm locked up. Can you save me?

233
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,660
Ling!

234
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:49,550
Ling!

235
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,460
Ling!

236
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:52,170
Donglai?

237
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,480
Donglai!

238
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,380
Donglai!

239
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:56,970
Ling.

240
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:58,710
Donglai.

241
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:00,570
Ling.

242
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:01,540
Are you okay?

243
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,400
I knew you would come to save me.

244
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,130
Just wait.

245
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,090
Ling.

246
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:13,980
Donglai.

247
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,540
I knew you would come to save me.

248
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:18,540
It's okay now. Let's go home.

249
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:21,370
Let's go.

250
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:23,230
Be careful.

251
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,240
I'll hold your hand.

252
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,150
This way.

253
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,190
Watch out!

254
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:45,170
In order to save you,

255
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:47,010
[Lin Xiaxi, daughter of the director of Jiangdong Hospital]

256
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,410
Donglai was injured by a boulder.

257
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,630
Do you know he's going to be disabled?

258
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:50,030
No.

259
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:51,450
No.

260
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,260
Please save Donglai.

261
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:57,330
Follow me.

262
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:04,530
As you know,

263
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,630
the Lin family and the Han family have been friends for generations.

264
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,200
My father has always treated Donglai as his future son-in-law.

265
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,020
When he got to know about your engagement,

266
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,420
he was already very angry.

267
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:13,860
And now…

268
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:15,520
What do you want me to do?

269
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:21,270
Disappear.

270
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:25,790
Donglai.

271
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:26,900
You're finally awake.

272
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,430
Ling.

273
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:28,930
Let me see

274
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:29,780
if you're okay.

275
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:30,970
I'm here to say goodbye.

276
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:32,750
I'm leaving.

277
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:34,620
The big city still doesn't suit me.

278
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:35,390
It's too dangerous.

279
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:37,530
What do you mean?

280
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,270
Let's break up.

281
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:42,990
Ling,

282
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,570
what on earth happened? You can tell me.

283
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,310
Didn't you hear me? I said, let's break up.

284
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,800
I finally understand that you can't protect me.

285
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:52,850
Besides, you can't even protect yourself in the future,

286
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,390
with your injury this time, Young Master Han.

287
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:55,980
Shut up.

288
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:58,220
Auntie.

289
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:58,920
Get out!

290
00:11:59,160 --> 00:11:59,910
-Get out!
-Auntie.

291
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:00,630
Auntie.

292
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:03,150
You're so cruel.

293
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,090
Donglai became like this because of you.

294
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,490
We don't even know if he can recover.

295
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:08,070
I don't know if he'll recover.

296
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:09,060
That's why I want to break up with him.

297
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,560
I don't want to take care of a patient for the rest of my life.

298
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,010
You...

299
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:12,770
Enough!

300
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,320
What on earth happened?

301
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:18,360
Ling, tell me the truth.

302
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,750
I have nothing to say.

303
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:20,610
Bye.

304
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:24,980
Ling.

305
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,640
Ling, please don't go.

306
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,370
-Donglai!
-Donglai!

307
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:27,950
Ling.

308
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,230
-Please don't go.
-Donglai, your legs.

309
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,080
Ling, don't go!

310
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,490
Call the doctor!

311
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:33,120
Ling!

312
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,790
I beg you.

313
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:35,550
Ling.

314
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,140
Ling, please don't go.

315
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:37,940
Donglai.

316
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,310
Forgive me.

317
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:40,280
Donglai.

318
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,020
So this is the kid that Donglai picked up?

319
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,210
You're pretty cute.

320
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:49,540
I wasn't picked up.

321
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:50,460
Okay.

322
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,410
What's your name?

323
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,400
Mom told me

324
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,390
not to talk to strangers.

325
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,790
You're quite proud.

326
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:58,970
Where's Young Master?

327
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:00,070
Is he still in the lounge?

328
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:01,780
Young Master...

329
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:03,560
Miss Lin.

330
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,550
Donglai.

331
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:10,040
You...

332
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:16,960
Zhong Ling?
