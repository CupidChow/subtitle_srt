00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,580
[Episode 7]

2
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,800
- What is it?
- Your Highness.

3
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,700
This is the crown prince's carriage.

4
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,800
Please move aside.

5
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,600
Let go of me!

6
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,400
Why did you stop?

7
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,200
Crown Prince, it's Prince Li.

8
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,700
Do you need me to teach you what to do?

9
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,200
I got this, Your Highness.

10
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,900
In Northern Lin, besides the emperor's carriage,

11
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,800
the carriage of the Eastern Palace should pass first.

12
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,000
This is the crown prince's carriage.

13
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,200
Commoners should move aside immediately.

14
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,000
Who are you calling commoners?

15
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,100
Hold tight.

16
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,300
Somebody!

17
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,000
- He's a lunatic!
- Crown prince!

18
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,800
Let's go!

19
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,700
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

20
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,300
Your Highness.

21
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,230
Choose a good horse from your barn... and send it to the capital's yamen.
(Yamen: headquarters or residence of a Chinese government official or department.)

22
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,300
Yes, Your Highness.

23
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,500
It's already late and your clothes are wet.

24
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,200
Stay in my manor to dry your clothes first.

25
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,600
- Your Highness.
- Lead this lady inside to rest.

26
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,000
Yes, Your Highness.

27
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,000
This way, please.

28
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:24,800
♫ I've been secretly missing you for several seasons already ♫

29
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:31,500
♫ Who was the first to talk about love? ♫

30
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:37,400
♫ I'm still trying to be nice to myself ♫

31
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:44,200
♫ Just allow me to get you back to this date ♫

32
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:51,100
♫ The western wind dyes the flowering season
in thick gray color ♫

33
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:57,800
♫ And I am still standing here waiting for the rain to come ♫

34
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:04,000
♫ No matter how good or bad the season turns out ♫

35
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,200
♫ I will still try with my utmost to make a home for us ♫

36
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,000
Your Highness, Miss Man Yao is here.

37
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,200
Have a seat.

38
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,600
Thank you for letting me stay here yesterday.

39
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,800
I feel uneasy that I had stayed here for a night.

40
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,400
So, I'm here to bid my farewell.

41
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,400
You want to leave?

42
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,000
Yesterday night, I used my horse to ram into the crown prince's carriage.

43
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,800
And the crown prince saw that you were riding with me.

44
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,900
Although the crown prince can do nothing to me,

45
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,200
it would be easy for him to arrest you for ramming into him...

46
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,600
and interrogate you in his manor.

47
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,500
If you don't believe me, you can walk out from this manor.

48
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,400
I think the spies from the Eastern Palace...

49
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,800
will be very glad to arrest you and bring you to him for interrogation.

50
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,200
You are the one who rammed into him, not me.

51
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,000
If he's a reasonable person,

52
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,600
he won't try to take advantage of you in the prison of the Minister of Justice.

53
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,300
I can't stay long in your manor.

54
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,900
There are many things that await me in Moon Embrace Teahouse.

55
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,800
Before you came back to Zhongshan,

56
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,500
your teahouse was doing fine on its own.

57
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,000
But now that you are back,

58
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,200
it seems like they can't do without you for even a second.

59
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,600
Can you help me once more?

60
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm helping you by keeping you here.

61
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,200
But if I don't go back,

62
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,400
I'm afraid that they'll make trouble in the teahouse.

63
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,400
That's an easy solution for that.

64
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,200
Guards!

65
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,000
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

66
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,200
Bring a few people along to keep a close eye on Moon Embrace Teahouse.

67
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:02,200
If someone dares to make trouble, teach them a lesson.

68
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,400
Yes, Your Highness.

69
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,000
I'll go together with them.

70
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,500
Thank you, Your Highness. Farewell.

71
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,200
Don't go yet.

72
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:21,600
- Your Highness.
- I sent them to protect the teahouse.

73
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,200
But I didn't say that you could leave.

74
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,700
But...

75
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,000
Wuyou, actually,

76
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
there are ways for you to know whether Man Yao likes you or not.

77
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,299
What are they?

78
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,000
I can use drugging mist to test her.

79
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,900
This is too unrefined.

80
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,600
For women, they say one thing and mean another.

81
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,800
We need to use both hard and soft tactics.

82
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,800
If she wants to leave, make her stay.

83
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,000
If she wants to stay, make her leave.

84
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,800
If she wants to go east, make her go west.

85
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,200
If she wants to say something, silence her.

86
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,000
Until the end when she listens to you,

87
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,400
it'll mean that she has given you her heart. Understand?

88
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,800
I thought that you were not interested in women.

89
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,600
But I remember that in the teahouse back then,

90
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,600
you were the one who...

91
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,200
That day, I didn't mean to ram into you.

92
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,600
But I couldn't help it, not with the situation back then.

93
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,500
I did not do it on purpose.

94
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,800
If you have any doubts about me,

95
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,600
you can just say it out.

96
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,600
No point to force me to stay here.

97
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,400
If a woman is too stupid,

98
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,200
she'll be detestable.

99
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,200
If she is too smart, she'll be feared.

100
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,000
Although that's not your intention,

101
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,700
you have already captured my heart.

102
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,600
Your Highness, about the Clearwater River...

103
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,000
I'll report it later.

104
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,000
Your Highness, you have more important things to do.

105
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,800
I'll take my leave first.

106
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,700
For me, there is nothing more important than you.

107
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:29,200
♫ I think of you when the moon is full ♫

108
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,100
Follow me. Let me bring you to a place.

109
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:39,000
♫ You who came to a strange land to build our lands together ♫

110
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,800
♫ I think of you when night has fallen... ♫

111
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:48,000
♫ and when the fog has parted ♫

112
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,900
♫ My yearning for you has turned you into my reason ♫

113
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,800
♫ You are my happiness, my worries and... ♫

114
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,600
This place looks like it's newly built.

115
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,400
Why did you bring me here?

116
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,500
What do you think about the designs here?

117
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:15,100
I just know that the things here are very expensive.

118
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,600
I know nothing about designs.

119
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,400
They just decorated it with rare and beautiful things.

120
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,100
I'm just asking you whether or not you like it.

121
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,400
You have good taste.

122
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,600
I think this place is very nice.

123
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,800
Since you like it,

124
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,600
from now on, this place will be called Man Yin Chamber...

125
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,800
and will be given to you. How about that?

126
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,800
♫ Are for us to waste ♫

127
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,200
♫ Rather than having no worries
and having a dull life ♫

128
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,400
♫ I'd rather pursue you ♫

129
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,600
♫ Even though the flower might wilt and I might fail ♫

130
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,400
♫ at least I had tried my best ♫

131
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,400
- Brother Wuyou.
- Princess Zhao Yun,

132
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,000
His Highness is busy with his duty.

133
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,500
What kind of duty is this?

134
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,800
Zhao Yun, who let you in?

135
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,500
Brother Wuyou, I'm here to thank you.

136
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,800
The son of Prince Qing He has asked my uncle for my hand.

137
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,600
Princess Rong Le humiliated him in public last time.

138
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,100
So, he wants revenge.

139
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,600
My uncle almost agreed to his proposal.

140
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,000
I heard that luckily you managed to break off that marriage in public.

141
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,800
Or else, I would have to marry that pervert.

142
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,300
No need to marry that kind of person.

143
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:35,000
I know. In this world, only you treat me the best.

144
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,600
Another person is Princess Rong Le.

145
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,400
Who is this woman? How can you bring her to your manor?

146
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,000
You are already engaged to Princess Rong Le.

147
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,200
No need to meddle with my affairs.

148
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,600
Leng Yan, bring her back to her manor.

149
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,300
Please come with me, Princess.

150
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:53,600
Brother Wuyou, how can you do that?

151
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,800
What should we do?

152
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,700
Brother Xiao, you are back!

153
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,300
Princess Rong Le didn't come back last night and no news from her.

154
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,700
Has something happened to her?

155
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,200
I'll search for the princess.

156
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,000
Are you sure that the princess didn't come back at all last night?

157
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,600
That's right. The princess didn't come back at all.

158
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,400
Both of us have waited for a whole night.

159
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,600
That's right. Both of us slept in the princess's room...

160
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,100
and never left the place.

161
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,300
Your Highness.

162
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,800
That day, we were disturbed when were playing chess in the teahouse.

163
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,200
Today, how about we give our best...

164
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,000
and play a few rounds of chess again?

165
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,700
All right.

166
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,800
It's no fun to just play chess.

167
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,200
How about we make a bet.

168
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,100
What bet?

169
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,600
If I lose, I'll fulfill one request of yours.

170
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,400
If you lose, you have to let me go.

171
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,200
What's so bad about my manor?

172
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,800
Why do you want to leave this place again and again?

173
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,300
This manor is fantastic.

174
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,900
But I'm just a commoner.

175
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:01,200
It's not convenient for me to stay here for long.

176
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,600
You are so sure that you will win?

177
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,400
Your Highness, Prince Chen is here.

178
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,400
He has insisted to see you.

179
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,800
Pardon me.

180
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,800
Wuyou.

181
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,000
Wuyu, what are you doing?

182
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,100
I heard that you already examined this body yesterday night.

183
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,900
You must have known that he's Deputy Minster Ma.

184
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,400
And he's the right-hand man of Yu Shihai.

185
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,600
But why will he appear on the ship...

186
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,800
and why will there be a shipwreck?

187
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,500
Wuyou, you already knew about it since the beginning. Right?

188
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,100
What are you trying to say?

189
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,200
Deputy Minister Ma is the main witness for this rank-selling case.

190
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,900
This ship is full of other innocent people.

191
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:19,600
Yu Shihai has sacrificed so many just to kill Deputy Minister Ma.

192
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,000
Do you have evidence?

193
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Deputy Minister Zhang was killed in a fire in his house.

194
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,600
Deputy Minister Cui met a sudden death while foaming at the mouth.

195
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,000
And together with this shipwreck incident,

196
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,800
those officers who died in these seemingly real accidents...

197
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,800
are all interconnected with this rank-selling case.

198
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:38,000
Wuyou, this is no accident. This is murder.

199
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,100
Since you already know, you shouldn't have come and made a ruckus here.

200
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:45,000
Wuyou, you saw how Sir Zhao died in that teahouse with your own eyes.

201
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Now, you are the only one who can solve this case.

202
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,800
But you chose to remain aloof.

203
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,300
I get you, Wuyou.

204
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,000
Please uphold justice for these innocent people.

205
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,800
Justice?

206
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,600
Justice again.

207
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,000
Do you think that you can solve all problems by getting rid of Yu Shihai?

208
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,400
This rank-selling business has been here for so long.

209
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,200
But nobody ever brought it up.

210
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,800
Do you know why?

211
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,400
If we dig deep into it, how many will turn out clean?

212
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,600
I don't care how many will turn out clean.

213
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,000
Have you forgotten?

214
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,800
When Chief Minister Qin was still alive, he said that...

215
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:24,200
if there's anybody who could continue his aspiration, it would be you.

216
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,400
Fine. If you don't want to take care of it,

217
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,800
then I'll take care of it myself.

218
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,800
After all, I have the letter.

219
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,800
I don't believe that they can get out scot-free.

220
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,200
What is it? Even you are mad at me?

221
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,200
When the Qin family was slaughtered,

222
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,900
how many in the court had stood up to him?

223
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:00,700
And how many of them had hit him while he was down?

224
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:04,000
My mother passed away and the transformation was put to a stop.

225
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,500
So, of course, the court is doomed to be unstable...

226
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,200
and rotten to the core.

227
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,700
Even if one has great power,

228
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:16,800
it would be hopeless.

229
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,800
- Leng Yan.
- Yes, Your Highness.

230
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,400
Find somebody to keep an eye on him.

231
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,800
If something happens to him, report to me immediately.

232
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,500
Yes, Your Highness.

233
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,400
Prince Chen!

234
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,400
- Get lost!
- Your Highness, you can't come in.

235
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,800
Zongzheng Wuyu, let go of me!

236
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,400
Don't you know that it's a capital crime to barge into the Eastern Palace?

237
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,200
Selling ranks and titles, and killing in cold blood...

238
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,200
are the real capital crimes here!

239
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,600
You!

240
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,899
Every case that is recorded in this letter...

241
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,800
is your doing!

242
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,500
I'll report this to our father.

243
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,000
Let's see how you deny it!

244
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,800
Give that to me!

245
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:12,500
- Guards! Are all of you useless?
- Your Highness.

246
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:18,000
Let go of me, you scoundrel.

247
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,800
You want to report me with this useless paper?

248
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:36,400
How dare you come here to threaten me with this?

249
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,400
How dare you destroy the evidence in the palace?

250
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,800
Evidence?

251
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,400
Well then.

252
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,800
Today, I'll take this evidence...

253
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,700
and bring you along to face our father.

254
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,200
Let's see what you can do to me.

255
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,500
Listen to me carefully.

256
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,000
Prince Chen barged into the Eastern Palace...

257
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
to assassinate the crown prince.

258
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,400
According to the law, I have to send him to the Supreme Court.

259
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:17,800
If anything else other than this message is spread out,

260
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,200
- kill the one who spreads it.
- Yes, Your Highness!

261
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:25,300
How dare you, you scoundrel!

262
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,100
Evidence?

263
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:54,300
Your Highness, this is the third round.

264
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,400
It looks like you are going to lose again.

265
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,600
According to our bet,

266
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,200
you have to let me go.

267
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,800
When did I agree to your bet?

268
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,600
Your Highness, this is already a foregone conclusion.

269
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,970
You are going back on your words?

270
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:11,400
What if I do?

271
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,800
In chess, you don't regret the steps you took.

272
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,600
There will always be a winner and a loser.

273
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,800
If you are so scared about losing,

274
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:25,000
from now on, I won't dare to play chess with you again.

275
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Are you threatening me?

276
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,000
I don't dare to.

277
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,600
Actually, you are not a person who cares about winning or losing.

278
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:40,100
Or else, you wouldn't take care of Princess Zhao Yun who has a family.

279
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:44,700
Looks like you are not thinking about chess or the bet.

280
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,700
What are you trying to say?

281
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:51,000
If I play chess with you and brood after I lost,

282
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,500
I wouldn't have the heart to improve my skills.

283
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,800
So, I'll just keep on losing to you after that.

284
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,600
But if I focus on improving my skills...

285
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,400
and trudge forward,

286
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,600
even if I lose to you again in the end,

287
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,400
at least I had tried my best.

288
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,800
Try your best.

289
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,600
Trudge forward.

290
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Looks like you are good at comforting a person.

291
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,400
If I don't know how to twist my words around,

292
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,000
how can I do business?

293
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,200
So, in your opinion,

294
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,600
how should I go forward?

295
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,900
Although the art of chess...

296
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,400
is focusing on that three-steps-ahead theory,

297
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,200
the one step that you have to take now...

298
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,900
is the most important one.

299
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,000
You want me to take on the rank-selling case.

300
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,700
If you don't take this step,

301
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:54,300
more innocent people are going to be dragged into this, right?

302
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:00,000
Your Highness, something bad had happened.

303
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,800
There is news saying that Prince Chen tried to... assassinate the crown prince.

304
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,600
And Yu Shihai has sued him for murder and slandering the crown prince.

305
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,200
Now, he's already in prison waiting for his trial.

306
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,090
[Qianlin Palace]

307
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,400
The prisoner, Qin Yong is here.

308
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,400
Prisoner Qin Yong is a traitor to the country.

309
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,400
He and his whole family will be executed.

310
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,200
Those officers who died in these seemingly real accidents...

311
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,000
are all interconnected with this rank-selling case.

312
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,400
This is no accident.

313
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,400
This is murder.

314
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:31,800
My mother's dying wish won't protect you forever.

315
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,000
This will be the last chance I give you.

316
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,200
Although the art of chess...

317
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,900
is focusing on that three-steps-ahead theory,

318
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,700
the one step that you have to take now...

319
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:46,200
is the most important one.

320
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,800
If you don't take this step,

321
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,300
more innocent people are going to be dragged into this, right?

322
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,600
I have lived long enough.

323
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,700
I never thought that I'd be able to see Prince Li in the court.

324
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,200
Prince Li is young but capable and he's brilliant.

325
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,000
He even secured the three states in the south.

326
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,200
He's at his prime.

327
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,800
The war with Wei is starting soon.

328
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,400
Now that Prince Li is here,

329
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,400
I think there will be changes in the court.

330
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,200
That's right.

331
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,000
Arrival of His Majesty!

332
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,400
Long live the Emperor!

333
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,200
You may rise.

334
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,600
Thank you, Your Majesty.

335
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,800
In today's morning court, we will discuss Prince Chen's case.

336
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,800
What do you have to say?

337
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,900
Please voice it out.

338
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,200
Your Majesty.

339
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,200
About the murder of Deputy Minister Ma, we have proof that...

340
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,700
the sunken ship was made by the Ministry of Public Works...

341
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:30,100
that is under Prince Chen.

342
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,200
From the remnants of the ship that were scooped out,

343
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:36,600
we found the names of the shipbuilders and their supervisor.

344
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,200
Prince Chen thought that the evidence was destroyed.

345
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,600
So, he took out a false letter in palace ground...

346
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:46,200
to accuse the crown prince and me.

347
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,300
Your Majesty.

348
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,600
Let's put the death of Deputy Minister Ma aside first.

349
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,800
The letter is about rank-selling.

350
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,200
And it spoke of great implication.

351
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,600
We have to do a thorough investigation to be sure of the culprit.

352
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,000
Before this, Sir Ma and Prince Chen had fought over...

353
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,200
a girl from a public house.

354
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,400
Madam Qin from House of Fragrance has personally told us about it.

355
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,600
Now, he used a letter to accuse me and Sir Yu...

356
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,600
that we are involved in a rank-selling case.

357
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,800
I think he just wants to offend me.

358
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,500
Wuyou, what do think about this?

359
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,000
The shipwreck case is widely connected to many things.

360
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,600
We can't just make a hasty conclusion.

361
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,600
As for the rank-selling case, whether or not it's a false accusation,

362
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,500
I'll personally investigate it.

363
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,400
Please ask the Ministry of Justice to hold on for now.

364
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,000
I'll bring the truth to light in a week's time.

365
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,600
Your Majesty, Prince Chen and Prince Li are very close.

366
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,600
I'm afraid that others won't be convinced...

367
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,500
if he's the one who takes on this case.

368
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:58,500
Your Majesty, pardon me for interrupting.

369
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,000
Since Prince Li has promised us seven days,

370
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,400
we'll do it the military way.

371
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,600
After even days, if he can procure the witnesses and evidence,

372
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,200
we'll put them to trial as per usual...

373
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,400
for both the shipwreck and rank-selling case.

374
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,400
If he has nothing, Prince Li will have to be caned,

375
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,600
his salaries deducted and his rank lowered. How about that?

376
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,500
Fair enough.

377
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,600
We'll do as General Fu has said.

378
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,000
Prince Chen, someone is here to see you.

379
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I don't want to see anybody at all!

380
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,200
Brother Wuyu, it's me.

381
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,400
Why did you come here?

382
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:00,000
How can a delicate princess like you come down to the prison?

383
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,600
Are you all right?

384
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,500
This place is dark and damp.

385
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,300
Did you eat and sleep well?

386
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:08,200
Did they do anything to you?

387
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,800
It's all right.

388
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,500
After all, I'm still a prince.

389
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,600
Although I'm not my father's favorite,

390
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,000
they can't do anything to me...

391
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,800
as long as I'm not guiltily charged.

392
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,100
- I already told you many times...
- So painful.

393
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,800
To think before you act.

394
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,000
Don't be affected by your temper and act rashly.

395
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,200
But you never listen.

396
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,500
You know how the crown prince is like, right?

397
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,200
He's petty and he seeks revenge for small things.

398
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,100
Why do you provoke him?

399
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,800
Now, in order to save you, Brother Wuyou...

400
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:38,400
had made a deal in the Great Hall to solve the case in seven days.

401
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,600
You are just worried about your Brother Wuyou.

402
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,000
Don't cry.

403
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,600
It's my fault.

404
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,200
Don't cry.

405
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,200
Stop crying, I beg you.

406
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,200
Princess Zhao Yun, it's late already. You should leave now.

407
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,200
If crown prince and Sir Yu find out about this,

408
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,800
I'll be dead.

409
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,700
All right.

410
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,700
Stop crying.

411
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,500
Don't worry. I'll go and beg the empress now.

412
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:20,600
I'll beg her to talk the emperor and crown prince into letting you out.

413
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,600
Promise me, don't cry anymore.

414
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,000
All right.

415
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,700
You have to take care of yourself.

416
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:50,600
You still haven't found the person that I had asked you to?

417
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,900
This person is very cunning.

418
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,200
At first, we already had his trace.

419
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,500
But when we reached there,

420
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,600
he had already left.

421
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,000
I'll send more people to look for him.

422
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,600
No need. The more people there are,

423
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,300
the easier it is for information to be leaked.

424
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,000
Send a message to Minister Wu.

425
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,800
He'll be in charge of this.

426
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,400
We have to find this person's hiding spot.

427
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,400
- Yes, Your Highness.
- You may leave.

428
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,800
Your Highness.

429
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,000
You are still here.

430
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
How's Prince Chen?

431
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,200
Looks like you are quite worried about him.

432
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,000
Prince Chen is very straightforward and he hates evil.

433
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,800
Now, he is framed by others and has been sent into prison.

434
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,400
I feel bad for him.

435
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,100
He is too reckless and he never thinks about the consequences.

436
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:57,600
It's time for him to learn his lessons.

437
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,700
If you really think that,

438
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:04,200
you wouldn't have gone to the court to accept this case.

439
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,400
Before, you never took part in state affairs...

440
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,200
and yet people had already sent assassins to murder you.

441
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,200
Now, you went into the court and accepted this case.

442
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,600
There will be more assassination attempts for sure.

443
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,600
Please be careful, Your Highness.

444
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,800
Are you worried about me?

445
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,800
Before this, you always acted so cold.

446
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,300
So, I thought that you were a heartless man.

447
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,800
But from the looks of it now,

448
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,200
by lending a helping hand to Princess Zhao Yun...

449
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,300
and taking on a case for Prince Chen,

450
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:37,000
I can see that you have a cold exterior...

451
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,800
but with a warm heart inside.

452
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:44,400
I respect you. That's why I worry about your safety.

453
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:48,900
If you think so, why do you always think about leaving?

454
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,500
I'm different from you.

455
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,100
I have my own mission.

456
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,600
What is your mission?

457
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:04,400
My mission is of course about expanding my business.

458
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,600
I want to open my teahouse in every country.

459
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,200
You are quite ambitious.

460
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,000
This is just the ambition of a merchant.

461
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,500
It's incomparable to you who have to care for the people in this nation.

462
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,100
I don't have many people around me.

463
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:23,400
I'm just doing my best to protect them.

464
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,100
The people in this nation...

465
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,800
have nothing to do with me.

466
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,400
You might say that...

467
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,900
but that might not be what you think.

468
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,000
Why do you say that?

469
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,400
I know a little about Lady Yun and Chief Minister Qin...

470
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,800
when they were still alive.

471
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,200
And they have my deep respect.

472
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,300
I don't need to guess...

473
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:48,100
whose memorial tablet this is for.

474
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,400
It has been more than 20 years.

475
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,800
But you still remember the departed.

476
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,400
I can see that you have never forgotten...

477
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,700
about your elders' unfulfilled wishes.

478
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,600
If other people speak about this,

479
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,400
I would not give them a chance to continue.

480
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,900
You know that I bring no ill will.

481
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,800
You have a clear view on the shipwreck case.

482
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:15,100
I can see that you have always paid attention to public affairs.

483
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:19,400
That's why you let Prince Chen make a scene in the Eastern Palace.

484
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,900
Because everything is under your control.

485
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,200
Looks like I have underestimated you once again.

486
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,400
I'm sure that... you have already read that letter.

487
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,500
I found that in the Moon Embrace Teahouse.

488
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:38,200
Of course, I need to take a look to make sure that...

489
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,200
it won't bring me any harm.

490
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,200
You have a really good pair of eyes.

491
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,499
I didn't look with my eyes.

492
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,419
I look with my heart.

493
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:59,339
Only by using your heart,

494
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:01,419
can you see the intentions of others.

495
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:04,899
Then can you see my intentions toward you?

496
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:08,979
♫ I miss you but I can only gaze at you in silence ♫

497
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:14,200
♫ You are keeping me out with your care.
Although we are together... ♫

498
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,700
You are a very closed-off person.

499
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:19,000
I think I can only see the things...

500
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
that you chose to let me see.

501
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:27,300
Usually, you are very careful with words and you are good at pretending.

502
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:30,600
But you said so much today.

503
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,000
Are you trying to tell me that...

504
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,200
it'll be dangerous for me to be too close to you?

505
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,900
And so, I should send you back immediately?

506
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,200
You think too much, Your Highness.

507
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:47,500
I just feel that... if a person is too good at pretending,

508
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,200
he'll live a very exhausting life.

509
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,600
In this life, if there's no one who understands you,

510
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,300
wouldn't you feel very lonely?

511
00:34:55,300 --> 00:35:00,200
♫ For you, I am willing to suffer ♫

512
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:04,400
♫ I want to ward off the coldness for you ♫

513
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,200
♫ As long as I can be with you ♫

514
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:12,600
♫ I'm willing to give you all of me ♫

515
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,600
Lian Xin, clean it carefully.

516
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,700
Don't spoil it.

517
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,900
Lian Xin.

518
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,400
Lian Xin!

519
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,000
Yes, Sister Ling Yue.

520
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:50,800
Sir, do you have news about the princess?

521
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,600
I already know where she is.

522
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,400
- She will be back soon.
- That's great.

523
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,400
- I'll go and make some preparations.
- Me too.

524
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,900
Lian Xin.

525
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,300
Thank you, Brother Xiao.

526
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,700
Please enjoy your meal.

527
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,200
Where is His Highness?

528
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,800
He's still in discussion with Sir Leng.

529
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,100
I don't wish to eat these oily foods today.

530
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,000
Please prepare some porridge and some dishes for me.

531
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,800
All right.

532
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,500
Come out.

533
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,400
- Are you all right, Princess?
- I'm fine.

534
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,400
I'm fine. What about you? How did you get in?

535
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,500
I had been waiting for a chance to come in.

536
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,800
I saw some carriages coming without being checked.

537
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,600
So, I followed the last carriage to come inside.

538
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,100
Why did nobody check the carriages?

539
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,300
I think they carry the secret files from the palace.

540
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,800
Only Prince Li can open them.

541
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,400
Princess, I'll find a way to bring you out.

542
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,200
No need.

543
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,100
Since Prince Li keeps me here,

544
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,400
I can use this chance to get some information.

545
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,900
Since you are here, help me out.

546
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,400
Your Highness.

547
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,400
[The Lin Village outside of the northern suburb.]

548
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,500
- Send someone to get him.
- Yes, Your Highness.

549
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,200
Wait.

550
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,000
Leng Yan, take a look at this.

551
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,700
Do you still remember that...

552
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,800
when Chief Minister Qin was still here,

553
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,700
he used to bring in talented people from all over the place...

554
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:13,200
- to work for our nation, right?
- Yes, I do.

555
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,800
The Chief Minister didn't care about their family backgrounds.

556
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:19,000
So, many people from the poor had become officers in the court.

557
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Something was mentioned here.

558
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,400
Sixteen years ago, Li Zhiyuan was appointed as a third-rank officer.

559
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,400
He is a high-ranking talent.

560
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,100
Based on what I know, most of the high-ranking talents...

561
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:33,200
from that period were hired as assistants...

562
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,400
to join in with the writing of "The Book of Mountains and Rivers."

563
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,600
The Book of Mountains and Rivers.

564
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,200
So, not only Li Zhiyuan...

565
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:43,500
has the evidence about the crown prince selling the ranks,

566
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,000
it's very possible that...

567
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
he has the clue about my teacher's case sixteen years ago.

568
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,600
- Search the roof for intruders!
- Roger that!

569
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,400
Your Highness, nobody is outside.

570
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,300
The Book of Mountains and Rivers.

571
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,700
- Who is it?
- It's me.

572
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,000
Come in.

573
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,200
It's so late. What is it?

574
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,000
I saw that you were still awake.

575
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,600
So, I brought a calming incense for you.

576
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,300
Thank you for your care, Your Highness.

577
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,600
Rest well.

578
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,700
Princess, we already have a clue about the book.

579
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:36,200
What is our next step?

580
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,400
Princess, you can't waver.

581
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,100
You have to be determined.

582
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:47,200
Please remember that you are Princess Rong Le of Western Qi.

583
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,100
Just focus on hiding yourself well.

584
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:52,800
Go back the same way when they send out the secret files.

585
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,800
Do not reveal your identity.

586
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,700
I have my own plans for "The Book of Mountains and Rivers."

587
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,400
Need not worry about it.

588
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,200
Yes, Princess.

589
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:15,700
Scoundrel! How can you let Li Zhiyuan escape?

590
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,800
He's just a helpless scholar.

591
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,800
Where can he run?

592
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,400
Li Zhiyuan is very secretive.

593
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,900
We couldn't find him although I had sent out many to do so.

594
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:26,800
If we can't find him, I'm sure that Prince Li can't find him either.

595
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,600
As long as he stays hidden,

596
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,000
Prince Li can do nothing against us.

597
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,800
Idiot!

598
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,000
This man knows too many of our secrets.

599
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,800
Now that Prince Li knows that he's still alive,

600
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,200
he must be killed.

601
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,400
We can't let Prince Li get to him first.

602
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,800
Now, the His Majesty's trust is already wavering.

603
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,800
If we are exposed for selling ranks,

604
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:00,000
the crown prince will be in deep trouble. Understand?

605
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,200
Sir Yu, if this man lives and the worse comes to worst, I'll just lose some money.

606
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,600
But for the Yu family,

607
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:12,200
you are the ones who will be in deep trouble.

608
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,600
Yes, Your Highness.

609
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,200
Sir, Li Zhiyuan's house is already empty.

610
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,600
These are the ones left.

611
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,400
Where is Li Zhiyuan?

612
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:41,200
♫ I've been secretly missing you for several seasons already ♫

613
