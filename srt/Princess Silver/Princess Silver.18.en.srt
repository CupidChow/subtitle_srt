00:01:30,047 --> 00:01:32,251
[Episode 18]

2
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,700
Do you know any trustworthy doctors?

3
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,600
It's better if they are also great herbalists.

4
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,200
I need you to find out if there is anything wrong...

5
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,400
with these herbal remains.

6
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,600
Where did you get these from?

7
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,800
I took this decoction every day when I was in Western Qi.

8
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,500
It's supposedly a treatment for my headache and memory loss.

9
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,000
Now that I think about it, maybe this concoction...

10
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,500
is the source of my headache and my memory loss.

11
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,000
Are you saying that the Emperor of Qi is trying to harm you?

12
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,100
I don't know.

13
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,500
After everything that I had experienced,

14
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:13,200
I can't trust him or the people of Western Qi anymore.

15
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,200
I don't know how he could be so cruel to his own family.

16
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,400
I couldn't even budge his plan...

17
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,300
even when I threaten him with my life.

18
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,700
I even think that...

19
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,400
maybe I'm not even the princess of Western Qi.

20
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,200
No need to be so disheartened.

21
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,200
Maybe he had no choice but to sacrifice you for the country.

22
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,400
We'll find a way to deal with it...

23
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,200
if we really find out that these remains are problematic.

24
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,000
I'll entrust this to you then.

25
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,600
I've always considered you as my best friend.

26
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,800
It's my honor that you are willing to...

27
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,100
entrust this task to me today.

28
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:56,300
I'm really happy for you now that you've pulled yourself back together.

29
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,200
You have always known me very well.

30
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:03,200
You know that... I wouldn't be willing to live a life of lies and deception.

31
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,500
Even if they love me.

32
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,300
I want to know who I am,

33
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,600
where I'm from,

34
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,100
and where I am going to go.

35
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,000
- Feather duster.
- Be careful with it.

36
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,600
Vegetables.

37
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,100
What is wrong with you, Miss?

38
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,800
Bring her to the physician.

39
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,600
It's dangerous to let this beautiful lone lady to lie here.

40
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,400
- This lady looked fine just now.
- What happened?

41
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,400
- Why did she suddenly faint?
- Quick. Bring her in.

42
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,000
- All right.
- Quick.

43
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,800
Miss Chen Yu, nobody will come in now.

44
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,600
You can open your eyes already.

45
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,000
Thank you, Physician Li.

46
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,400
You've made such an effort to get here.

47
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,800
Are you in trouble?

48
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,200
This decoction's remains are very important.

49
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,000
Please help me to check their components.

50
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,600
And please keep this to yourself.

51
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,800
This is easy. But a decoction's remains are different from the actual herbs.

52
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,400
Their shapes and properties have changed.

53
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,000
I think I'll need a few days to carefully examine them.

54
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,100
I'll wait for your news then.

55
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,000
Thank you for your help.

56
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,800
- General.
- What is it?

57
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,800
Miss Chen Yu went out for a while...

58
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,200
to buy rosin and other things for her zither.

59
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,300
After that, she fainted because she was ill and was sent to the physician.

60
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,000
She went back after a while.

61
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,200
- Where's my wife?
- Lady Rong Le has returned safely.

62
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,200
She stayed put in the teahouse for a whole day today.

63
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,000
And everything else is normal for the others in the manor.

64
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,300
- How is she feeling?
- I think she is feeling better.

65
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,600
Laughter was heard coming out from the teahouse.

66
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,600
Since the teahouse has been reopened,

67
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,700
Lady Rong Le has put all of her energy into it.

68
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,600
You can rest assured, General.

69
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,400
When she is busy, she will forget about the past...

70
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,800
and stay by my side without worry.

71
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,000
If she likes to go to the teahouse, let her be.

72
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,500
She can find happiness in the Moon Embrace Teahouse.

73
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,000
I believe that one day, in this manor,

74
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,600
she'll find the same happiness here.

75
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,000
General, if you have really fallen in love with her,

76
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,500
our...

77
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,400
This is not something you should intervene in.

78
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,300
Yes, General. I've spoken out of turn.

79
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,000
Pass down my orders.

80
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,100
Find me the best tailor in the city.

81
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,400
I want to give my wife a new dress of the highest quality.

82
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,000
I want her to attend the Eastern Palace banquet in style...

83
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,300
as the wife of the General of Defense.

84
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,800
Yes, General. I'll pass on your orders.

85
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,600
- Lady Rong Le.
- Lady Rong Le.

86
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,200
Princess Rong Le.

87
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,600
General Fu had this dress made specifically for you.

88
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,600
Look how pretty it is. Do you want to try it on?

89
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,800
No need.

90
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,200
I'll put it on when it's time for us to leave.

91
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,700
And these were sent by General Fu as well.

92
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,200
I heard that they are gifts from His Majesty.

93
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,000
Princess, these red dates are the tributes from Qingzhou.

94
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,700
Red dates?

95
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,700
I heard that these red dates are the specialties of Qingzhou.

96
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,700
Qingzhou has given a lot of them as tributes.

97
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,000
That's why His Majesty has given them to his subjects.

98
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
General Fu knows that you love them,

99
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
that's why he has sent them to you.

100
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,000
Qingzhou is full of these.

101
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,700
If you love them so much,

102
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,600
I'll bring you to my manor in Qingzhou...

103
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,000
and let you eat your fill.

104
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,800
Is it good?

105
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,600
Princess, no matter what His Majesty gives,

106
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,400
General Fu will send those gifts to you right after he receives them.

107
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,000
Princess, General Fu is here.

108
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,500
Thank you for the dress.

109
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,400
Do you like it?

110
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,300
Clean up and change into it as soon as possible.

111
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,300
We can't let the Eastern Palace wait for too long.

112
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,600
- All right. Let's change now then.
- Yes, Lady Rong Le.

113
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,200
Congratulations, Crown Prince. Congratulations, Lady Xiang.

114
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,300
Zhao Yun.

115
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,400
Come.

116
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,000
Greetings, Your Highness. Greetings, Lady Xiang.

117
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,200
- Your Highness, this lady is...
- She is Princess Zhao Yun.

118
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,100
Her father was conferred a title because of his contributions, but he has passed away a long time ago.

119
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,700
Now, she is staying outside.

120
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:07,500
But my father dotes on her, so she can still move freely in the palace.

121
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,200
Crown Prince.

122
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,000
I've brought you some good wine.

123
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Come, My Lady.

124
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,900
- Greetings, Lady Xiang.
- Greetings, My Lord.

125
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,900
Greetings, Fair Consort of Crown Prince.

126
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,400
Long time no see, Princess Zhao Yun.

127
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,900
Please send my regards to your uncle and your family.

128
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,200
The arrival of General Fu!

129
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,200
- General Fu.
- Lady Rong Le is here.

130
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,000
Xiang, quickly say your thanks to this benefactor of yours.

131
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:38,100
Greetings from me and my wife to you, Crown Prince.

132
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,200
You have exaggerated just now.

133
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,000
Lady Xiang is different now.

134
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,100
There's no need for thanks between us.

135
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,800
Greetings, Your Highness.

136
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,600
I wish that you'll always be young and pretty, Lady Xiang.

137
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,400
Thank you, General Fu.

138
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,100
Thank you, Lady Rong Le.

139
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,000
So, this is my stand-in.

140
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Is she a chess piece that my brother has put in Northern Lin...

141
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
or is she the mouthpiece for Fu Chou to send words to the Eastern Palace?

142
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,800
- Lady Rong Le is here.
- She is indeed a princess.

143
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,600
- That's right.
- Her elegance is outstanding.

144
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,400
- Look at her.
- Xiang, accompany Lady Rong Le.

145
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,000
She is so beautiful.

146
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,400
General Fu, after you.

147
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,400
After you, Your Highness.

148
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,200
I can tell that this dress is of the finest silk.

149
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,000
Only the Rare Item Chamber is able to make such a high-quality dress.

150
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It suits your elegance, Lady Rong Le.

151
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,400
Zhao Yun.

152
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,300
- That's so good.
- She's so pretty.

153
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,800
Lady Rong Le, please wait.

154
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,800
Thank you for coming here today.

155
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,900
That day, we didn't get to talk much in the General's Manor.

156
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,000
Now, you have become the general's wife.

157
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,300
Life is unpredictable. I hope that...

158
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,300
you can look after me in the future.

159
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,200
You are the crown prince's favorite right now.

160
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,500
I should be the one who asks you to look after me.

161
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,200
Compared to the deep affection between you and General Fu,

162
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,700
this favor that I get is just nothing.

163
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,200
Do you know why people are treating you

164
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,200
so politely today in this banquet?

165
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,800
General Fu.

166
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,000
Out of respect to you,

167
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,800
I have chosen each guest carefully beforehand.

168
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,800
I want to make sure that your wife is treated like an honored guest.

169
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,600
Thank you, Your Highness.

170
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,000
General Fu, I don't get it.

171
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,200
What did the woman seduce you with...

172
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,700
until you are trying so hard to protect her?

173
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,000
And you even kept it a secret from her.

174
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,400
Since he wants to keep it as a secret,

175
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:33,500
what is the reason for you to reveal it to me?

176
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,700
I just feel that it's unfair for General Fu.

177
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,800
This is a secret between us.

178
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,660
I hope that you won't betray me.

179
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,000
Lady Xiang, all the guests are here. When can we start?

180
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,200
The banquet is going to start now.

181
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,400
Let's take our seats.

182
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,800
Thank you, Your Highness.

183
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,000
Come!

184
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,900
I'm very happy today that...

185
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:05,200
you are able to attend the birthday banquet of my beloved Lady Xiang.

186
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,200
I wish for her to be young and happy always.

187
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,200
Come, let's cheer.

188
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,900
Sit down.

189
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,800
Princess Zhao Yun. Let's drink together.

190
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,400
- Come. Let's drink together.
- Let go of me!

191
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,200
How dare you reject my invitation to drink together?

192
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,700
- Let go of me.
- I'm honoring you by doing so.

193
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,800
- How dare you reject me?
- Let go of me!

194
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,300
- If I ask you to drink, then drink it!
- Get lost!

195
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,200
You are drunk.

196
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,200
I think it's better for you to go back and rest.

197
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,800
I'm sure that the crown prince won't mind.

198
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,300
It's you.

199
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,800
How dare you criticize me again here?

200
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,800
Your Highness.

201
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,200
I'm very happy today and I would like to ask you a favor.

202
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,400
I'm very gleeful today as well.

203
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,400
What is it that you want?

204
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,900
As long as Lady Xiang agrees,

205
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,000
I can give you anything.

206
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Please allow me to take Zhao Yun as my concubine.

207
00:13:13,286 --> 00:13:14,799
In your dream!

208
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,600
If you marry me, you won't have to depend on others.

209
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,600
Prince Qing He's Manor is one of the richest lot in this city.

210
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,400
I think that both of you are quite a match.

211
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,000
What do you think, Lady Xiang?

212
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,900
You are right, Your Highness. I'll leave it to you to decide.

213
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:33,400
- All right, then I'll...
- So what if he's rich?

214
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,300
I heard that he's a playboy.

215
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,800
Not only does he has many wives and concubines,

216
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,400
he even defiles his maidservants.

217
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,800
How can he be a good match?

218
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,500
You are such a wench.

219
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,800
Others don't dare to say it... but I'm not afraid to do so.

220
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,400
You are fickle and lascivious.

221
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:51,500
Everybody knows about... about your relationship with that Zongzheng Wuyou.

222
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,600
You were with another before you were married...

223
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,200
and in the Yun Mausoleum, you even...

224
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:05,400
Looks like he has indeed had too much to drink.

225
00:14:07,148 --> 00:14:10,399
General Fu, he is drunk.

226
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,200
Please forgive him... out of your respect for me.

227
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,800
Your Highness, I feel a little bit light-headed.

228
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,400
I wish to go back to change. I'll be back soon.

229
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,000
Go ahead.

230
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,800
Be careful.

231
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,300
I'm really impressed with your actions, General Fu.

232
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,200
The son of Prince Qing He likes to frequent the brothels...

233
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,300
and he has many wives and concubines.

234
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,400
He has no regard for himself and has humiliated another's wife.

235
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,800
It's good that General Fu has taught him a lesson.

236
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,600
If he has done wrong,

237
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,600
he should have been prepared to get the punishment he deserves.

238
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,400
Is this a warning for me?

239
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,400
I won't dare to do it.

240
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,200
I can't help but blurt it out when I saw the deep affection...

241
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,200
between General Fu and Lady Rong Le.

242
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:08,000
I don't feel well. I'll take my leave now.

243
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,300
Please uphold justice for me.

244
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,000
Your Highness!

245
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,600
Your Highness.

246
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,500
- Please uphold justice for me.
- This...

247
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,400
What happened?

248
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,400
When I went back to my room to change just now,

249
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,400
I saw that my maidservant had hung herself to death...

250
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,800
as soon as I opened the door.

251
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,700
What?

252
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,200
Your Highness, before the banquet,

253
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,400
I saw the son of Prince Qing He harassing Xiao Cui.

254
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,800
I don't know what happened.

255
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,400
Nonsense!

256
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,000
Your Highness.

257
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
My personal maidservant is dead on my birthday.

258
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,300
Such an ominous incident.

259
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,100
If this spreads, I'm afraid that...

260
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,800
Lady Xiang, don't treat me so unjustly.

261
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,400
From now on,

262
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,600
none of the people from your manor shall step a foot in here.

263
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,600
Kick him out!

264
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,000
Your Highness!

265
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I'm innocent!

266
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,300
Thank you, Princess Rong Le.

267
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,100
Lady Rong Le, if you have been offended by the incident just now,

268
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,800
we can go back to our manor.

269
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Crown Prince, we'll take our leave first.

270
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,800
Farewell.

271
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,200
Please wait, General Fu.

272
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,400
Today's incident has displeasured both of you.

273
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,600
It's my fault for being not attentive enough.

274
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:55,000
This is a gift from the crown prince to express his regrets.

275
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,800
Thank you to the crown prince and to you, Lady Xiang.

276
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,400
Farewell.

[Moon Embrace Teahouse]

278
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:20,000
Mistress, this is the prescription derived from the decoction's remains.

279
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,500
There's no problem with it.

280
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,600
It's just some normal medicine meant for headaches.

281
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,800
There are some valuable tonics in it as well.

282
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,000
I think they were added because your body is weak.

283
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,600
Are you sure that it's really safe?

284
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,400
He is my most trusted physician.

285
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,700
To make sure that he's right,

286
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:38,500
I had asked other physicians to check it out as well.

287
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,600
And the remains turned out fine.

288
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,400
Looks like I've thought too much.

289
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,800
Chen Yu, I'm surprised that you have done this...

290
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,600
so well and so carefully.

291
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,700
I've been wading in this city since young.

292
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,500
I've gotten to know people of all sorts.

293
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,200
That's how I'm able to hold my place in this savage place.

294
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,700
But you have to be careful.

295
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,300
I was followed when I went to the apothecary house that day.

296
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,000
I think that person works for General Fu.

297
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,200
He guards against me...

298
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,900
and I'm suspicious of him.

299
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:15,500
By the way, when you were in the House of Fragrance,

300
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,100
do you know about this dancer named Hen Xiang...

301
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:22,600
who is very beautiful and is a skillful dancer?

302
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,100
I've never heard of her.

303
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:30,100
But if she's as outstanding as you say she is,

304
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,600
why did nobody know about her?

305
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:38,900
That's why I need you to investigate her for me.

306
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,900
I want to see if she's really from the House of Fragrance.

307
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,600
I want to know when she came to the city...

308
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,800
and how she ended up dancing in the General's Manor.

309
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,200
Don't worry, Mistress. Just wait for my news.

00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,000
I want to see you.

313
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,400
Have you found the things I need?

314
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,600
These are all the secrets I had collected from the Eastern Palace.

315
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,900
It includes the clique that the crown prince and officials are in...

316
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,200
together with the transactions and their secret meetups.

This is it?

318
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,800
You took a risk in front of my wife to ask me to come here...

319
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,400
just to show me these kinds of useless things?

Hen Xiang, remember.

321
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:49,400
From now onwards, unless it's a very important matter, or else,

00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,800
don't come out from the palace without permission. Understand?

00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,400
I don't want to see the crown prince.

325
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,400
And I don't want to take pains to cater to a person that I don't like.

326
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,700
What nonsense are you talking about?

327
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:08,300
Now, everything we do has to be for the greater good.

328
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,400
Keep a close eye on that crown prince.

329
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,800
He'll be of use to us in the future.

330
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,000
Do we really have to do this?

331
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,300
You are the only one I trust.

332
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,300
Although this is quite risky,

333
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:28,800
I trust no other but you.

334
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:33,100
All right. I'm willing to do anything for you.

335
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:37,100
Don't worry. The Eastern Palace is under my control now.

336
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:41,000
I'm just worried about... that princess of Western Qi.

337
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,400
She has nothing to do with the things that you need to do.

338
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,400
I know you.

339
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,500
In the banquet today, you had really gotten angry for real.

340
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,400
If you have fallen in love with her,

341
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,000
it'll affect our grand plan.

342
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,700
Take good care of yourself.

343
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,800
I have to leave now.

344
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,100
Father.

345
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,700
Greetings, Father.

346
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,600
Father.

347
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,200
- Why did you call me here?
- Spoiled brat!

348
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,600
The music from your banquet in the Eastern Palace...

349
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,200
was so noisy until I could hear it from my resting chamber.

350
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,300
And you did it just to celebrate the birthday of a woman from a public house.

351
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:50,400
Even the censorate has complained to me.

352
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,100
They say that you have no talent, no morals,

353
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,700
and are not worthy to be a crown prince.

354
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,200
Please calm down, Father.

355
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,100
I'm just using my concubine's birthday as a way...

356
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:04,300
to bond with my brothers, nieces, and my some of my close officials.

357
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:08,600
Go back to your palace today and get rid of that woman.

358
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:12,400
If you do this again, I'll strip you of your crown prince title.

359
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,800
Yes, Father. I'll obey.

360
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,000
Thank you for forgiving me.

361
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,400
My Lady, my personal maidservant is dead.

362
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,900
I just want to bring in two maidservants of mine from outside of the palace.

363
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,400
Why do you have to make things difficult for me?

364
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:41,000
Aren't you afraid that I'll tell His Highness about it?

365
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,700
Are you going to ignore the imperial rules just because he dotes on you?

366
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,800
Now, all of the servants are like the weathercock.

367
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,500
They're all trying to get in your good grace. You can just grant it.

368
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,300
Why do you need to buy them from outside of the palace?

369
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,500
- Your Highness.
- Xiang.

370
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,800
You better tone it down.

371
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,100
My father has found out about the birthday banquet.

372
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,900
He wants to kick you out from the palace.

373
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,000
It's my fault for dragging you into this, Your Highness.

374
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,200
Please release me from the palace. I'll leave now.

375
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,300
Xiang, quick.

376
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,000
Get up.

377
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,700
His Majesty was just dressing me down.

378
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,800
He didn't punish me.

379
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,600
Moreover, now, besides the Eastern Palace,

380
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,900
who else can he trust?

381
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,400
You just need to stay in the Eastern Palace quietly.

382
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,400
And he'll forget about it in a few days' time.

383
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,300
Yes, Your Highness.

384
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,800
How could you feign compliance like that?

385
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:43,300
Looks like you don't really care about His Majesty anymore.

386
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,200
Are you the one who complained about me?

387
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,600
Do you need me to remind you again?

388
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,200
Now, you don't have your family to protect you anymore.

389
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,200
Your life or death is in my hands.

390
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,660
Don't use His Majesty to scare me off.

391
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,700
I'm doing this for your own good.

392
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:05,600
But you've always treated me with malice.

393
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,700
Fine.

394
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:11,200
I won't advise you anymore from now on.

395
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,500
But I want to remind you one last time.

396
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,800
Unpalatable advice benefits conduct and good advice jars on the ear.

397
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,200
You'll understand what I mean by that if you ever happen...

398
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,000
to get into deep trouble one day.

399
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,200
- You!
- I'll take my leave now.

400
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,200
So gloomy!

401
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,600
You are such a gloomy person!

402
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,800
Xiang, come and drink with me.

403
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,000
Let's forget about her.

404
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,500
Princess Rong Le, Princess Zhao Yun is here to see you.

405
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:11,100
Zhao Yun, do you have something to tell me?

406
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:14,700
Princess Rong Le. Today, I heard the news from the palace...

407
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:19,200
saying that the son of Prince Qing He has been sent to the border.

408
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,200
Finally, I don't need to see him anymore.

409
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,400
Thank you, Princess Rong Le.

410
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,000
No need to thank me. You are my sister.

411
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,200
It's only right for me to help my sister.

412
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,200
Princess Rong Le, these are the red dates from Qingzhou.

413
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,300
I know you love these.

414
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,200
Brother Wuyou sent them to me.

415
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,700
Actually, he wanted me to send them to you.

416
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,200
Zhao Yun, it has taken you a month to think this through.

417
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,900
Let's just talk about us today, all right?

418
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:57,300
Princess Rong Le, I know that you are a kind person.

419
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:00,200
You didn't mean to lie to me and Brother Wuyou.

420
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,200
You must have had your own difficulties too...

421
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,800
regarding the matter between you and Brother Wuyou. Right?

422
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,100
Have a taste of it.

423
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,600
I'll use food to plug your mouth.

424
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,400
It's tasty.

425
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,500
Princess Rong Le, look at how beautiful your writing is.

426
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,600
Wuyu always ridicules me...

427
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,400
about my spidery writing since young.

428
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,900
Can you teach me how to write?

429
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,400
After I practice my writing, I'll write a letter to Wuyu.

430
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,200
He'll be so surprised.

431
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,700
Sure. Come on then.

432
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,000
My writing has improved.

433
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,000
You are getting better at it.

434
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,900
Princess Zhao Yun. Let me take a look at it.

435
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,200
Here.

436
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,600
It still looks ugly.

437
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,400
Ling Yue, do you mean me or my writing?

438
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,600
I mean your writing.

439
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,400
Ling Yue! You!

440
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,400
- Stop running around.
- Stop running, stand there!

441
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:35,400
- She's waving the brush around.
- I'm going to draw on your face!

442
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,800
You!

443
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,000
Ling Yue, how dare you say that it's ugly?

444
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,600
- Save me, Princess Rong Le!
- Stop right there!

445
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,200
Tell me. Is it ugly?

446
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,200
Stop running!

447
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:02,400
Rong Le, I'll be satisfied as long as you are happy.

448
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:06,400
But when can this happiness of yours belong to me?

449
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,900
General Fu.

450
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,600
It's rare to see her so happy.

451
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,100
Give them some time alone.

452
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,600
- I got you! How dare you say that!
- Don't run!

453
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,100
I'm going to doodle on your face.

454
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,600
Let me wipe it off for you.

455
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,800
- I can't wipe it off.
- Enough, Princess Zhao Yun.

456
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,600
Let's go and wash it off. We can just wash it off with water.

457
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,000
You look quite fine.

458
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,400
All right. Let's go.

459
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,000
Let's go.

460
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,000
[General Fu, it's been so long. How is Rong Le?]

461
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,600
[I'm here to ask about the book.]

462
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,400
[Have you gotten any clues from her? Don't force her.]

463
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,000
"The Book of Mountains and Rivers."

464
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,900
What did the Emperor of Qi say?

465
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:18,000
He's been asking me about Rong Le's condition recently...

466
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,800
and if we have any updates on the book.

467
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,800
The Emperor of Qi believes that the princess has gotten the book...

468
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,500
but she's not willing to give it to him.

469
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,700
Could it be that she has given it to Prince Li?

470
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:32,200
I think that it must be related to Zongzheng Wuyou.

471
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,800
It's possible that they broke off because of the book.

472
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,900
How's the situation at the southern border lately?

473
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:43,000
Zongzheng Wuyou neglects his duty and loiters in his manor all day long.

474
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,600
He won't meet anybody.

475
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,800
I don't think he'll pose any threats to our grand plan.

476
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,200
Don't let down your guard against him.

477
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:56,000
Wuyou is very good at concealing his true self.

478
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,900
He might seem nonchalant, but he can set the world alight.

479
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,500
We have to learn from the mistakes of Yu Shihai.

480
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,300
We can't let ourselves end up like them.

481
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:08,000
By the way, have you gotten any news on the seven mysterious men...

482
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
that appeared on my wedding?

483
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,900
I'm too incompetent. I still haven't found anything about them.

484
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:16,600
No matter what, we have to know the ins and outs about them.

485
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,700
I'm still worried about him.

486
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:24,800
- Go to the southern border for me.
- Yes, General Fu.

487
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,200
[Qingzhou]

488
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:48,300
Wuyou. Wuyou.

489
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,900
You are playing chess with yourself again?

490
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:55,200
How are you going to improve if you play with yourself every day?

491
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,000
Soon, I'm going to be better at it than you.

492
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,400
Have you done your chores?

493
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,300
I just simply went through all of them.

494
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,700
I'm not like you.

495
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,400
The public affairs here are a mess.

496
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,400
My head is spinning just by looking at them.

497
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,200
Moreover, the scholars here are very powerful...

498
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,800
and their relationships are very complicated.

499
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:15,200
All of them are very cunning.

500
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,200
I can't deal with them.

501
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,800
Luckily, Sir Sun is willing to help.

502
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,400
So, I've left everything to him.

503
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:26,500
Wuyou, I've sent the red dates to Zhao Yun regularly just like you asked.

504
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,800
You should forget about all the things that happened in the city.

505
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,200
You have to pull yourself together.

506
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,300
The three states of the southern border and the whole of Northern Lin...

507
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,900
are depending on you.

508
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,300
Greetings, Your Highness.

509
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:46,300
Your Highness, I've prepared some snacks for you.

510
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,200
Miss Sun, you've come right on time.

511
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,000
I heard that you are very skilful in chess.

512
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,400
How about you finish off this round with Wuyou?

513
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,600
Let me learn something from it.

514
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,400
I'm not that good. You are too kind, Your Highness.

515
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,700
My father has left this manor in my care.

516
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:04,000
I wouldn't dare to waste my time to play chess here.

517
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,100
Your servants can attend to the matters in the manor.

518
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,400
But you are the only one who knows how to play chess.

519
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:12,600
Your priority is to take good care of Wuyou, right?

520
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,000
Stop joking around, Your Highness.

521
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,800
- I'll take my leave first.
- Yali.

522
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,200
How about we play a round of chess together?

523
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,400
In the meantime, you canupdate me about your father.

524
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,800
That's right. Take a seat.

525
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,200
Wuyou, please start now.

526
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,600
I want to see how are you going to resolve this chess.

527
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,500
We can't resolve it anymore.

528
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:37,500
After you put down that piece, it became a stalemate.

529
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,600
How about we discard this round...

530
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,800
and start anew?

531
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,200
Your turn.

532
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,000
I thought that you were going to play chess with that person only.

533
00:33:19,509 --> 00:33:23,091
- Sir Xiang.
- Sir Zheng, long time no see.

534
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,200
General Fu has sent me to remind you that...

535
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,800
it has always been fair and square between us.

536
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:31,400
You took our money but we have seen no result.

537
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:35,100
It makes the general question your loyalty.

538
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,600
I wouldn't dare to be disloyal.

539
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,600
I've been under the general's care for so many years.

540
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,800
Of course, I'll repay him.

541
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:44,500
But it's not easy to get close to Zongzheng Wuyou.

542
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,600
He won't budge no matter what.

543
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:52,300
After he reached Qingzhou, no matter how we plead to meet him, he'll reject us.

544
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:57,300
The only thing that I heard is that he spends a lot of time... with the daughter of Sun Jizhou.

545
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:01,400
Isn't it better for our plan if Zongzheng Wuyou does nothing?

546
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,400
I was just about to report to you about that.

547
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:12,400
- General.
- Sir Qin will be leading this plan.

548
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,800
The poor here are foolish and ignorant.

549
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,000
We can whip up chaos easily.

550
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,200
Get it done then.

551
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,800
General.

552
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:24,400
You know that as soon as the war starts,

553
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,600
money will be gone very fast.

554
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:30,200
I wonder if you could sponsor us a little bit more?

555
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,800
As long as this is successful, you'll be rewarded handsomely.

556
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,400
How dare you ask money from the general?

557
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:39,200
Sir Zheng, you assume importance by amassing troops.

558
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,000
You keep those who can help you,

559
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,600
not those ungrateful scum that are of no help.

560
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,900
I understand.

561
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:08,800
My son, the southern border has always been a flourishing place.

562
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,800
Recently, the number of refugees that have revolted...

563
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,900
is way higher than that of the number in poorer places.

564
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,200
Something is not right.

565
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,100
We have to investigate it properly.

566
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,600
Father knows that Wuyu and I are innocent.

567
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,700
He sent me here to shield me from trouble, to let me take a breather...

568
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:30,400
and to investigate this incident secretly.

569
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,300
From his secret letter, he wrote that something is not right.

570
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:37,400
But... the scholars here are very powerful and they are deep-rooted here.

571
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,800
The government here is weak.

572
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,200
And the army here is understaffed and has no power.

573
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,800
I don't know where to start.

574
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,400
Greetings, General Fu.

575
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,600
I've sent the money to the southern border just like you've requested.

576
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,700
But my master would like to ask you about the book.

577
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:10,200
Do you have any news about it?

578
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,400
Zongzheng Wuyou neglects his duty...

579
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,600
and is having fun all day long at the southern border.

580
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,600
He doesn't act like a person who has gotten the book.

581
00:36:19,752 --> 00:36:22,395
Maybe the princess has never gotten her hands on the book.

582
00:36:22,395 --> 00:36:26,395
Maybe... she had said that just to spite him.

583
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,600
Tell the Emperor of Qi that...

584
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,300
if I have any news about "The Book of Mountains and Rivers,"

585
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:35,400
I'll tell him everything without pause.

586
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,900
One more thing. His Majesty wants to remind you...

587
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:40,300
to take a good care of the princess.

588
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,700
He'll continue to support you.

589
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,500
But if anything happens to her,

590
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:49,100
you won't be able to deal with the consequences.

591
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,000
She is my wife.

592
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,600
Of course, I'll love and respect her.

593
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,800
Please ask His Majesty to rest assured.

594
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,800
That's for the best. Farewell.

595
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,600
One day soon, I'll be free from your threats...

596
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,300
and become the master of this world.

597
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,700
I believe that... as long as you put your mind to it,

598
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,900
you'll be able to do that.

599
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,000
How's the preparation for the fake identity?

600
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,400
Of course, it's seamless.

601
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:50,400
Princess, a letter from Miss Chen Yu of the Moon Embrace Teahouse.

602
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,100
Such a beautiful lady.

603
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:01,000
If you look closely, she's a bit similar to you.

604
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,700
But she's not as pretty as you.

605
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:07,800
Lady Xiang is from Western Qi.

606
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,000
Could it be that my brother...

607
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,600
Xiao Sha!

608
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:16,200
- What is it, Princess?
- I need to ask you something.

609
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,600
Have you ever seen this lady before?

610
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,800
Never.

611
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:39,000
I heard that Moon Embrace Teahouse has some new tea coming in.

612
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:47,400
I would like to take some from you so that I can send them to the palace.

613
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,600
Would you mind if I do that?

614
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,200
You can help yourself with them.

615
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,100
No need to ask for my permission.

616
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,400
Thank you.

617
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,600
Everything in this manor belongs to you anyway.

618
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,500
I hope that it'll be as you said.

619
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,300
I hope that one day,

620
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,800
your heart will belong to me, too.

621
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:24,500
Sir Sun, the Zheng family has been here for centuries as well.

622
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,400
We have produced generations of high-ranking officials.

623
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,400
And we are bonded with your family through several marriages.

624
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,400
The hundreds of acres of land in the eastern suburb is a wasteland.

625
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:37,000
Why can you claim the land while I cannot?

626
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Are you going to do as you please regardless of centuries-old rules...

627
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,400
of the major clans here just because you are the princes' teacher?

628
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,000
What nonsense.

629
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,200
The land in the eastern suburb is not without its owner.

630
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,500
Those farmers are tired of raising crops.

631
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,700
They chose to willingly serve the Sun family instead.

632
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,600
So, of course that land belongs to me.

633
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,500
It's not a wasteland without an owner.

634
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,400
Don't be angry. Everything can be discussed.

635
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,800
- Calm...
- Lately,

636
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,600
during the chaos at the southern border...

637
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,100
where refugees flee in disorder and lands turn to waste,

638
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,800
you've taken mean advantage of us.

639
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,700
You've swallowed up many of our lands.

640
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,900
Now that General Fu has brought us peace again,

641
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:13,200
why did you poke your nose into the eastern suburb...

642
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,000
that has always been under me?

643
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,100
Are you trying to be the local despot of Qingzhou?

644
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,800
- You...
- Sir Zheng.

645
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,000
If you are fighting to be the local despot here,

646
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,400
then what about the Emperor of Northern Lin?

647
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,600
- Your Highness.
- Wuyou, you came right on time.

648
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,400
I don't want to sit here as an accessory anymore.

649
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,600
It's better if you take over.

650
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,100
You must be Prince Li.

651
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,200
I'm seeing you for the first time.

652
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,400
Forgive me for the slip of my tongue.

653
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,600
I wouldn't dare to let you address me as Your Highness.

654
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:46,800
A third of Qingzhou belongs to the Zheng family.

655
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,100
I'm just a passer-by. The land I own is just the one I'm standing on.

656
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:53,500
Compared to the great Zheng family,

657
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,700
I'm nothing.

658
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,200
You've exaggerated, Your Highness.

659
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:01,000
Thanks to our ancestors, my family has been here for centuries.

660
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,600
We have always dealt with the land affairs on our own.

661
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,000
We wouldn't dare to trouble you with it.

662
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,100
What do you mean, Sir Zheng?

663
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,900
All the lands in this nation belong to the emperor.

664
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:14,000
Only His Majesty has the final say on them.

665
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,600
There are no rules about dealing with the lands on our own.

666
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,900
I have no interest in this kind of thing.

667
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:25,100
If it's a centuries-old rule, then both of you can sort it out yourself.

668
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,300
Thank you, Your Highness.

669
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:32,800
Sir Sun, the number of people in your family has always been on the thin side.

670
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,800
You have no successor at all.

671
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,000
All the lands that you've fought for will just...

672
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,200
become the dowry for your daughter in the future.

673
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,000
You!

674
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,200
How about you marry your daughter to my son?

675
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,600
Then we'll become a family bonded by marriage.

676
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,600
When the time comes, I'll give these lands...

677
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:53,200
to you as betrothal gifts. How about that?

678
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,800
Miss Sun, don't worry.

679
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,600
You are the apple of his eye.

680
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,400
Your father won't let you marry that idiotic son from Zheng.

681
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,800
How about you asking His Highness for help?

682
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,200
If you have His Highness's support,

683
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:29,200
the Zheng family can do nothing to you.

684
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,800
Even if I manage to free myself from the Zheng family,

685
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,700
my father will still force me to marry someone I don't love.

686
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:40,000
I don't even dare to get close to His Highness.

687
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,600
If my father knows about it,

688
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,700
he'll give me two choices to choose from.

689
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:47,400
I have to choose either His Highness...

690
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,700
or the son of the Zheng family.

691
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,700
But both of them... are not the ones that I want.

692
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:58,400
Miss Sun, what are we going to do?

693
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:05,000
If only I could go back to Zhongshan.

694
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:23,600
Miss Sun, Prince Li has sent you a gift.

695
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,100
Such beautiful silver bracelets. There is a pair of them.

696
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:39,200
Miss Sun, is His Highness...

697
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:48,800
♫ I've been secretly missing you for several seasons already ♫

698
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:55,400
♫ Who was the first to talk about love? ♫

699
00:43:55,400 --> 00:44:01,200
♫ I'm still trying to be nice to myself ♫

700
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:08,300
♫ Just allow me to get you back to this date ♫

701
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:15,000
♫ The western wind dyes the flowering season
in thick gray color ♫

702
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:21,800
♫ And I am still standing here waiting for the rain to come ♫

703
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:28,000
♫ No matter how good or bad the season turns out ♫

704
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,900
♫ I will still try with my utmost to make a home for us ♫

705
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:45,000
♫ In just one day, I've tasted the entire human world's warmth ♫

706
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:51,600
♫ Yet, you are always the one I'm longing for ♫

707
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:58,000
♫ Even with thousands of feelings, we'll have no regrets ♫

708
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:05,000
♫ Look at this love, because of you I have a sweet aftertaste ♫

709
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:21,600
♫ In just one day, I've tasted the entire human world's warmth ♫

710
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:28,300
♫ Yet, you are always the one I'm longing for ♫

711
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:34,600
♫ Even with thousands of feelings, we'll have no regrets ♫

712
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:41,800
♫ Look at this love, because of you I have a sweet aftertaste ♫

713
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:52,600
♫ Nothing will... go away ♫
