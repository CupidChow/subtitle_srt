[Episode 9]

3
00:01:43,404 --> 00:01:47,312
I really want to know what's so good about this.

4
00:01:47,312 --> 00:01:49,688
Is it good because you are protecting each other,

5
00:01:49,688 --> 00:01:51,757
is it because you got rid of a dissident,

6
00:01:51,757 --> 00:01:54,638
or is it because you can treat human lives as nothing?

7
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:03,979
That's not true, Your Highness.

8
00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:08,139
If you are worried about the matters regarding Prince Chen...

9
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:11,599
Today is my birthday.

10
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,205
How about I use my luck today to ask the crown prince...

11
00:02:15,206 --> 00:02:19,926
to beg for Prince Chen's pardon from His Majesty?

12
00:02:19,926 --> 00:02:21,858
No need.

13
00:02:21,858 --> 00:02:25,000
Anybody who did wrong has to be punished.

14
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,320
No matter it's him or anybody else.

15
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,390
You mentioned luck.

16
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,362
Today, it's your birthday.

17
00:02:33,363 --> 00:02:37,509
But I would like to take something from you.

18
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,491
What is it that you wish to take from me?

19
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,540
- Father!
- Please think again, Your Highness.

20
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,365
- You can't do that, Your Highness.
- Your Highness!

21
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,920
I want to take your head. How about that?

22
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,906
Wuyou, you threaten an officer's life in public.

23
00:03:18,906 --> 00:03:21,200
Are you trying to revolt?

24
00:03:21,998 --> 00:03:25,954
Let's see who the one trying to revolt is here.

25
00:03:25,954 --> 00:03:28,692
Sir Yu, looks like you haven't taken a look...

26
00:03:28,693 --> 00:03:32,967
at the content of the ten art of war books that I had given you.

27
00:03:49,449 --> 00:03:53,036
How is it, General Fu? Do you understand now?

28
00:03:53,036 --> 00:03:57,067
Do you think we can still settle this in peace?

29
00:03:57,067 --> 00:04:01,745
I can't be sure of the authenticity of this name list.

30
00:04:01,745 --> 00:04:04,220
It doesn't if you are not sure.

31
00:04:04,221 --> 00:04:07,481
I believe that Sir Yu is very clear about it.

32
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:12,742
The ten scrolls on the floor contain the names of all those who are involved in this rank-selling case.

33
00:04:12,742 --> 00:04:15,080
Sir Yu might be able to kill Li Zhiyuan.

34
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,899
But you won't be able to kill those thousands of witnesses whose names were recorded by him, right?

35
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:24,755
Sir Yu, is Prince Li telling the truth?

36
00:04:24,755 --> 00:04:26,820
Crown Prince, this is slander.

37
00:04:26,821 --> 00:04:31,371
Prince Li, you can't prove us guilty with your words alone.

38
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:36,112
What are you trying to do?

39
00:04:36,113 --> 00:04:38,599
Father, we can't just let go of the foundation that...

40
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,640
our family has built for generations today.

41
00:04:40,641 --> 00:04:43,481
His Highness dares to accuse us in public...

42
00:04:43,482 --> 00:04:46,580
and point his sword at you. So, there is no need to be courteous to him.

43
00:04:46,581 --> 00:04:49,740
Yu Wenjie, you are just struggling for nothing.

44
00:04:49,741 --> 00:04:51,901
I know that you are very courageous.

45
00:04:51,902 --> 00:04:53,839
Even if you don't care about your own safety...

46
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,959
or the safety of Prince Chen who is in jail,

47
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,305
you only care about the safety of that mistress from the teahouse. Right?

48
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,391
Please think carefully.

49
00:05:40,391 --> 00:05:44,839
If you can let go of me today, we can start anew.

50
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:48,203
And we will let go of your woman.

51
00:05:57,194 --> 00:06:01,489
Sir Yu, nobody dares to threaten me.

52
00:06:01,489 --> 00:06:03,463
And nobody can threaten me.

53
00:06:03,464 --> 00:06:06,079
Prince Li, you really don't care for that woman's life?

54
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,900
Guards, bring that woman over.

55
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,181
You dare touch her?

56
00:06:31,685 --> 00:06:33,745
Wenjie.

57
00:06:37,222 --> 00:06:41,238
Prince Li, you are the one who forces my hand.

58
00:06:41,239 --> 00:06:45,371
This matter involves the many lives and honor of the Yu family for three generations.

59
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:47,959
I won't let you leave this place easily.

60
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,101
Guards! Close the door!

61
00:06:58,463 --> 00:07:00,523
Don't you dare!

[The Crane Cries at the Nine Springs]

63
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,540
A decree from His Majesty.

64
00:07:23,297 --> 00:07:25,401
As decreed from His Majesty,

65
00:07:25,402 --> 00:07:27,839
it's unforgivable that the father-son duo of Yu...

66
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:30,070
is involved in rank-selling and has duped His Majesty.

67
00:07:30,071 --> 00:07:32,650
They will be stripped of their ranks, their properties confiscated...

68
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,079
and will be sent to Supreme Court for trial.

69
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,280
The manor of Yu will be taken back and Prince Li will be in charge of it. Signed, His Majesty.

70
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,786
So, you came prepared.

71
00:07:42,433 --> 00:07:45,680
Scoundrel, it's time to admit to your crime.

72
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,939
Yu Shihai, you are always smart as a rule, but this time a fool.

73
00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:55,206
Do you think that... you'll be able to threaten me?

74
00:07:55,206 --> 00:07:58,839
You sell ranks for your own profits and kill the innocent. Such grave crimes.

75
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:03,159
Today, I won't let go of anyone within the three generations of your family.

76
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,297
Guards! Arrest all of them!

77
00:08:06,298 --> 00:08:07,918
Roger that!

78
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,978
Your Highness, let me send you back to the palace.

79
00:08:32,951 --> 00:08:34,531
Farewell.

80
00:08:36,971 --> 00:08:38,611
Let's go.

Find someone to clean up this place...

83
00:08:45,196 --> 00:08:46,919
and seal the door.

84
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,814
Nobody can enter this manor without my permission.

85
00:08:50,815 --> 00:08:52,475
Yes, Your Highness.

86
00:08:53,307 --> 00:08:55,161
You are really good, Wuyou.

87
00:08:55,161 --> 00:08:58,121
You managed to solve this case in seven days' time.

88
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:01,699
I would like to thank you on behalf of those who had died unjustly.

89
00:09:01,699 --> 00:09:04,840
Go back to your manor and pack your clothes. Stay at my place tonight.

90
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,999
What? Stay at your place? Why?

91
00:09:07,999 --> 00:09:11,279
Someone is coming in tomorrow. I have some work for you.

92
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,429
Wuyou! I just got out of jail.

93
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:17,429
I still have wounds all over my body.

94
00:09:17,429 --> 00:09:19,573
Let me rest for two more days.

95
00:09:19,573 --> 00:09:23,245
You've been resting in jail for seven days with good food and good sleep.

96
00:09:23,245 --> 00:09:25,846
You still want to rest?

97
00:09:25,846 --> 00:09:28,056
So, the treatment that I got in jail...

98
00:09:28,056 --> 00:09:30,920
I knew that you treated me best.

99
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:35,032
I'm in jail. Of course, you'll send someone to take care of me, right?

100
00:09:36,572 --> 00:09:40,392
All right. I'll go and pack now and move over to your place.

101

[Life]

102

Father, there's always a way out.

103
00:10:14,122 --> 00:10:15,408
It's still not over for us, right?

104
00:10:15,408 --> 00:10:17,768
- Crown prince—
- Shut up.

105
00:10:18,604 --> 00:10:20,829
Beware of eavesdroppers.

106
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,666
If you had known it would come to this, you wouldn't have acted thus.

107
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:31,956
Who asked you to act on your own?

108
00:10:31,957 --> 00:10:34,263
Now, we have totally offended Prince Li.

109
00:10:34,263 --> 00:10:37,131
Zongzheng Wuyou is evil. He is treacherous and ruthless.

110
00:10:37,132 --> 00:10:39,500
Usually, he looks like he paid no attention to public affairs.

111
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,199
He must have done a lot of evil things behind our back.

112
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,537
And that low-life Li Zhiyuan.

113
00:10:44,538 --> 00:10:46,420
How dare he haunt us even in death.

114
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:49,942
Everything is in the past now.

115
00:10:50,848 --> 00:10:54,145
I've decided to offer all of my properties...

116
00:10:54,145 --> 00:10:57,389
for His Majesty to prepare for war against Wei...

117
00:10:57,389 --> 00:10:59,734
in order to beg for our lives.

118
00:10:59,735 --> 00:11:02,878
Father, our house is already confiscated.

119
00:11:02,878 --> 00:11:06,678
If you donate all of that, what are we going to do when we get out?

120
00:11:06,678 --> 00:11:08,954
Our lives are already on the line now.

121
00:11:08,954 --> 00:11:12,142
How can you still care about that money?

122
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,810
Now, we need to raise our guard against the crown prince.

123
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,251
Crown Prince? He's on our side.

124
00:11:19,252 --> 00:11:22,145
- He won't leave us to die.
- Idiot.

125
00:11:22,146 --> 00:11:24,255
Now, for the crown prince,

126
00:11:24,256 --> 00:11:27,938
we are a liability just like Li Zhiyuan.

127
00:11:31,036 --> 00:11:33,676
Then we are totally done for.

128
00:11:34,573 --> 00:11:36,813
Not necessarily.

129
00:11:39,514 --> 00:11:41,689
I have already prepared for this.

130
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:45,097
All these years, I have a detailed record of all the money

131
00:11:45,097 --> 00:11:47,004
that was sent to the crown prince palace.

132
00:11:47,005 --> 00:11:50,361
And I have another copy just in case anything happens.

133
00:11:50,362 --> 00:11:52,839
As long as the crown prince visits us,

134
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,877
I'll have a way to make him keep us alive.

135
00:12:10,255 --> 00:12:12,059
What did the crown prince say?

136
00:12:12,059 --> 00:12:16,420
His Highness said that no matter how they interrogate you, admit to nothing.

137
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,393
Sit back and observe. When the time comes,

138
00:12:18,394 --> 00:12:20,494
His Highness will send someone to save you.

139
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:56,092
How dare he, Yu Shihai. I had trusted him.

140
00:12:56,092 --> 00:12:59,227
How dare he betray me and do something so hurtful to the nation.

141
00:12:59,228 --> 00:13:01,588
He deserves to die.

142
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,420
And you. First, you lost in the war against Wei.

143
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:08,960
Now, you sell ranks to earn money? What did you do?

144
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,663
Father, I'm innocent.

145
00:13:11,664 --> 00:13:14,072
Although I'm quite close with Sir Yu,

146
00:13:14,072 --> 00:13:16,759
I have never been to the Ministry of Personnel.

147
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,150
And I have never seen this name list before.

148
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:23,814
Your Majesty, Prince Li has entrusted me with all the evidence

149
00:13:23,814 --> 00:13:25,766
that are related to this case.

150
00:13:25,766 --> 00:13:28,960
The account book has shown that it's indeed the work of the Ministry of Personnel.

151
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,689
But when Sir Zhao was still alive,

152
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:33,700
the letter that he passed on to Prince Chen...

153
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,531
accused His Highness directly.

154
00:13:37,323 --> 00:13:41,220
Father, that letter was used by Prince Chen to slander me.

155
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,245
Please render me a fair judgment, Father.

156
00:13:44,245 --> 00:13:49,339
Your Highness, why are you so anxious to defend yourself?

157
00:13:49,339 --> 00:13:52,180
When we get the statement from the father and son of the Yu family,

158
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:55,446
everything will be clear then.

159
00:13:55,446 --> 00:13:58,575
Minister Sun, you are still ill.

160
00:13:58,575 --> 00:14:01,736
And yet you have to deal with the aftermath of Yu Shihai.

161
00:14:01,736 --> 00:14:04,993
If everybody in the court were like you,

162
00:14:04,993 --> 00:14:08,116
I wouldn't have so much on my plate.

163
00:14:08,116 --> 00:14:12,182
Your Majesty, I'm no longer young.

164
00:14:12,182 --> 00:14:14,155
I don't have any sons.

165
00:14:14,155 --> 00:14:18,683
So, it's only right for me to serve the country until the very end.

166
00:14:18,683 --> 00:14:21,339
If I had a son,

167
00:14:21,339 --> 00:14:24,086
I would have gone back to my hometown...

168
00:14:24,087 --> 00:14:26,627
to enjoy the rest of my life.

169
00:14:31,748 --> 00:14:36,000
Your Majesty, Yu Shihai and his son have committed suicide in jail.

170
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,220
What?

171
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,344
I already ordered the guards to keep a close eye on them.

172
00:14:39,344 --> 00:14:41,702
How did they still manage to commit suicide?

173
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,873
Prince Fan Yang. Investigate this case together with the Supreme Court.

174
00:14:51,873 --> 00:14:53,759
Don't let any of their affiliates get away.

175
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,777
Yu Shihai and his son are proven guilty of selling ranks and titles.

176
00:14:57,777 --> 00:15:00,415
They have committed grave crimes by breaking the imperial rules.

177
00:15:00,415 --> 00:15:02,654
Cut off their heads and display them as a deterrent for the public.

178
00:15:02,654 --> 00:15:05,059
The three generations of Yu, including their relatives and servants...

179
00:15:05,059 --> 00:15:06,799
will be sent to the border as soldiers.

180
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:08,210
Brilliant decision, Father.

181
00:15:08,211 --> 00:15:10,879
We need to be swift to get rid of traitors like them.

182
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,999
The crown prince has befriended the traitors and has bad conduct.

183
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,098
He is to be confined to the Eastern Palace until further orders.

184
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:23,157
Yes, Father. Thank you for your forgiveness.

185
00:15:23,157 --> 00:15:27,419
Prince Fan Yang, go to Prince Li's manor to pass on my decree.

186
00:15:27,419 --> 00:15:30,973
Reward him for contributing to this case.

187
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:33,711
His three states in the southern fringe will be tax-free for five years.

188
00:15:33,711 --> 00:15:36,680
From now on, all the matters regarding those states...

189
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,959
no need to be reported to the court. Just report to Prince Li's manor.

190
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,200
Yes, Your Majesty.

191
00:15:51,503 --> 00:15:54,956
Your Highness! Your Highness.

192
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,560
We have already taken care of the father-son duo as you asked.

193
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,906
Did you find it?

194
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,178
We found this account book in another courtyard of the Yu family.

195
00:16:09,178 --> 00:16:12,178
It contains all of the records written by Yu Shihai himself.

196
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:27,188
I have no choice but to sacrifice him to protect myself.

197
00:16:27,188 --> 00:16:30,429
I'm sure that he'll understand.

198
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:36,566
Creed of Vengeance leaves no trace. You can be rest-assured.

199
00:16:36,566 --> 00:16:38,907
We won't leave a trail.

200
00:16:39,543 --> 00:16:42,460
Don't worry. You have done me a great favor.

201
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,490
I will reward you handsomely.

202
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:46,380
The Creed of Vengeance doesn't need any rewards.

203
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,401
We just hope that you can support us when you become the emperor.

204
00:16:49,401 --> 00:16:52,281
Creed of Vengeance will be at your service.

205
00:16:52,281 --> 00:16:54,772
But now, you have lost a right-hand man.

206
00:16:54,772 --> 00:16:57,410
Do you have any other more useful supports...

207
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:00,917
to help you defeat Prince Li and secure the throne?

[Pavilion of Enjoyment]

210
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,237
Wuyou, I can't do it anymore.

211
00:17:27,237 --> 00:17:28,917
I can't.

212
00:17:32,939 --> 00:17:36,497
Yu Shihai has made this manor into such a luxurious place...

213
00:17:36,497 --> 00:17:38,622
with so many contraptions.

214
00:17:38,622 --> 00:17:41,022
He deserves to die indeed.

215
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,295
Such excellent workmanship.

216
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:47,082
Such excellent workmanship.

217
00:17:47,082 --> 00:17:50,181
Wuyou, where did you find this expert?

218
00:17:50,182 --> 00:17:54,480
He's acting so out of the world and so crazily every day. Is he dependable?

219
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,515
Master Xin, you have already searched for two days. Any clues?

220
00:17:58,515 --> 00:18:02,781
It must be here somewhere. Qin Yong is very smart.

221
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:06,300
He must have hidden it in an open place.

222
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:11,639
The entrance to the secret room must be located at the most unexpected place.

223
00:18:11,639 --> 00:18:16,799
Old Man Xin, I had already searched this place inside out for two days with you.

224
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,306
We even checked every crack in the wall.

225
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:23,439
Besides Yu Shihai's secret weapon and illegal punishment room, we found nothing.

226
00:18:23,439 --> 00:18:27,337
We didn't even find a trace of that secret room that you talked of.

227
00:18:27,337 --> 00:18:30,459
Master Xin, how long will it take?

228
00:18:30,459 --> 00:18:32,140
I can't be sure.

229
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,778
Wuyou, no need to trouble yourself so much.

230
00:18:34,778 --> 00:18:37,839
We can just tear the whole place down, right?

231
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:39,424
Nonsense.

232
00:18:39,425 --> 00:18:41,679
For a secret room that is built by Qin Yong,

233
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,757
if you could find it by tearing the house down, it wouldn't be a secret room.

234
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:48,720
Let me tell you. If you tear down the house, the secret room will be destroyed.

235
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,257
And you'll get nothing.

236
00:18:51,257 --> 00:18:54,620
How dare you talk like that to me. I can punish you for this disrespect.

237
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,480
Wuyu.

238
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,859
Wuyou, let this old man find the house alone.

239
00:19:01,859 --> 00:19:03,475
We didn't rest for two days already.

240
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:06,371
Look at him. He's still very energetic.

241
00:19:06,371 --> 00:19:10,471
I'm already exhausted. I can't do it anymore, Wuyou.

242
00:19:27,941 --> 00:19:30,448
Let me clean it up myself. I wouldn't dare trouble you.

243
00:19:30,449 --> 00:19:32,723
I'm the one who knocked into you. It's my fault.

244
00:19:32,724 --> 00:19:35,184
I wouldn't dare to blame you.

245
00:19:35,184 --> 00:19:38,448
Are you blaming me for the matters regarding Lian Xin?

246
00:19:38,448 --> 00:19:40,097
I wouldn't dare blame you.

247
00:19:40,098 --> 00:19:42,398
What if you suspect me again?

248
00:19:43,872 --> 00:19:46,939
I investigated Lian Xin because I noticed that she brought ill will towards the princess.

249
00:19:46,939 --> 00:19:51,355
You didn't betray the princess. Why would I investigate you?

250
00:19:51,355 --> 00:19:54,408
Your hand is bleeding. Let me take a look.

251
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,260
Let me take a look.

252
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:01,387
Why are you crying?

253
00:20:01,387 --> 00:20:04,992
If someone sees you like this, they'll think that I had bullied you.

254
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,860
Stop crying.

255
00:20:12,763 --> 00:20:14,387
Is a cut to the hand so painful?

256
00:20:14,388 --> 00:20:16,646
Yes, it is!

257
00:20:16,646 --> 00:20:19,994
All right. I'll cut myself too so that I can feel what you feel.

258
00:20:19,994 --> 00:20:23,805
What are you doing? Don't you know that finger cuts are extremely painful?

259
00:20:29,297 --> 00:20:31,517
Idiot.

260
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,819
When I came here during the party last time,

261
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,408
I had the geography here memorized.

262
00:21:04,409 --> 00:21:07,754
But this place is heavily guarded. We have to be careful.

263
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,689
- Aren't you an expert in contraptions?
- Enough.

264
00:21:22,689 --> 00:21:24,519
It has been so many days and we can't even find the secret room.

265
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,003
- Let alone the book.
- Stop being so noisy.

266
00:21:27,003 --> 00:21:30,043
It won't be so easy to find the secret room designed by Qin Yong.

267
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:34,981
I never thought that they'd be searching for the book too.

268
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:39,011
But looks like they are not very successful in it.

269
00:21:39,011 --> 00:21:41,440
Qin Yong is indeed the wisest man on earth.

270
00:21:41,441 --> 00:21:44,678
The contraptions that he designed are indeed extraordinary.

271
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:47,559
It means that we still have a chance.

272
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,700
Who is it?

273
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,799
Your Highness, what happened?

274
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,200
- Give chase now!
- Yes, Your Highness!

275
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,800
Your Highness, if you want to give chase in that direction,

276
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,800
you can just forget it.

277
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,100
Because the contraptions will get them.

278
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,900
No need to be so anxious.

279
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,100
Really?

280
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,800
Princess, find a chance to escape.

281
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,400
I'll take care of them.

282
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,000
Don't be so nervous.

Follow me.

284
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,000
Princess, how did you know this place so well?

285
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,500
Follow me.

286
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,800
Right, left, left, right, right.

287
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,000
Follow my steps. Don't take a wrong step.

- I'm fine, Princess.

289

00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,600
Thank you, Princess.

295
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,400
You're welcome.

296
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,500
If it wasn't for you who had protected me from harm last night,

297
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,900
I would have been the one with injuries today.

298
00:25:07,678 --> 00:25:09,679
We had gone through so many dangers together.

299
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,000
We can be considered as sworn friends already.

300
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
It's my duty to protect you, Princess.

301
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:22,300
This Yu family's fort is indeed full of contraptions.

302
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,800
And it's heavily guarded.

303
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,400
But after yesterday's incident,

304
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:29,400
it'll be hard for us to sneak inside again.

305
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,600
I had been to the manor twice.

306
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,400
I keep on feeling a sense of familiarity with that place.

307
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,200
Yesterday, I woke up suddenly.

308
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,200
The structures of those doors and walls...

309
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,600
are designed based on the Eight Trigrams.

310
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:45,000
The grass, woods, flowers, and stones are the variables.

311
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,900
Princess, I have always felt puzzled about one thing.

312
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:52,000
With Prince Li's affection towards you,

313
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,700
you can totally request him...

314
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,500
to let you tour the whole manor with him.

315
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:59,100
Why do you have to sneak in like that?

316
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:10,200
You know that... I have lost my memories.

317
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,600
I treat everyone in this world as strangers.

318
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,100
Those who treat me well,

319
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:19,300
I'll consider them as my friends and family.

320
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,000
Those who treat me badly,

321
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,300
I'll consider them as my enemies.

322
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,800
But after that, I realized that...

323
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:32,000
the hearts and feelings of the people in this world are not black and white.

324
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,900
I came here for my brother and for Western Qi.

325
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:37,200
I think I did the right thing.

326
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,300
But I'll often dream and wake myself up.

327
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:42,600
I feel that one day, they'll forget about me.

328
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,200
And they'll leave me here alone.

329
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,700
I sent Lian Xin away.

330
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:52,100
I feel that I had given her the best option.

331
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,800
But sometimes, I will feel angry.

332
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,200
Why did she betray me?

333
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,200
I need to find the book.

334
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,000
So, I have to get close.

335
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,200
But I vaguely feel that...

336
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,200
if I can't treat him with honesty,

337
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
then I shouldn't get too close to him.

338
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,400
So, this is the reason you avoid Prince Li so often.

339
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:24,100
Long Yue, if you truly like a person,

340
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,600
are you supposed to ask for nothing in return...

341
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,300
and you'll be satisfied as long as everything goes well for him?

342
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:40,300
In this world, everybody treats feelings differently.

343
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,300
Some, give their all.

344
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,800
And some, use it for their own advantages.

345
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,200
You have to ask yourself...

346
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,800
whether or not you wish for something in return.

347
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,400
Thank you.

348
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,600
I feel much better now.

349
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,500
Mistress, a customer has insisted to meet you.

350
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,200
Is that him?

351
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,800
Go on.

352
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,400
You are so beautiful.

353
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,600
I have fallen in love with you.

354
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,300
I have many lands and many servants.

355
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,600
Why don't you come back with me?

356
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,800
Why are you laughing?

357
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,200
If you go back with me,

358
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,600
you'll be able to enjoy untold wealth and glory.

359
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,000
It's better than depending on others for a living...

360
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
and live in humiliation, right?

361
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I thank you for your offer.

362
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,800
But too bad that...

363
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,500
I have a broad outlook on life.

364
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:25,800
It's better for you to come back after a few years when you have grown up.

365
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,400
Don't look down on me.

366
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:31,400
People like you only care about fame and gain, right?

367
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,800
The things that you offered, I can easily get them myself.

368
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,900
I rather have a man who is young and handsome.

369
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:42,400
I have fallen in love with you too, Princess Zhao Yun.

370
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,000
You...

371
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,600
You have seen through me?

372
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,600
It doesn't matter.

373
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,800
Wench. Let me tell you.

374
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,200
I'm here to test you.

375
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,400
Stay away from Brother Wuyou.

376
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,400
He is already engaged.

377
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:00,000
Princess of Western Qi is noble, elegant, beautiful, and wise.

378
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,200
She is way better than you.

379
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,700
I'm trying hard to avoid Prince Li.

380
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:07,100
But he's the one who always kept me by his side.

381
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:10,000
If you could spend more time with your Brother Wuyou,

382
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,400
then he wouldn't have time to look for me.

383
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,600
You...

384
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,200
You are such a bully!

385
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,700
Have you found out who the people that sneaked in that day are?

386
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,200
That day, I was too far away.

387
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,600
So, I didn't have a clear look.

388
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,600
But from their shapes, I think they were both female.

389
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,000
Your Highness.

390
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,700
They might be the female assassins from Creed of Vengeance.

391
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,200
Creed of Vengeance?

392
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,800
I have found out that those who tried to assassinate you in the teahouse came from the Creed of Vengeance.

393
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:47,000
Creed of Vengeance is a gang that has become popular in recent years.

394
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Their business focuses on stealing secrets and assassinations.

395
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,700
But it's very pricey to hire them.

396
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,800
The assassination of Sir Zhao and the other officers...

397
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,100
together with the death of Yu Shihai and his son...

398
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,100
are their doings.

399
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,100
How dare they do that.

400
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:03,700
A gang dares to meddle with the public affairs of the nation?

401
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:07,600
Only the Eastern Palace is able to pay such a high price...

402
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,200
and commit such grave crimes.

403
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,600
I already sent someone to pursue and capture them.

404
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,700
I never thought that they'll still dare to send someone forward.

405
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,400
I don't blame you.

406
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,800
No matter if it's Sir Zhao or Li Zhi Yuan,

407
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,600
they are always there right on the dot.

408
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,000
They leave of trace and they are as silent as the wind.

409
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,800
Looks like they have already infiltrated themselves into the court.

410
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,200
That's why they can be so precise.

411
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,600
Wuyou, let me investigate this together with Leng Yan.

412
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,600
We can't let them escape this time.

413
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,700
The crown prince is getting more and more rampant.

414
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,500
If he really becomes the emperor one day,

415
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,700
there will be no peace in this world.

416
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:46,300
Wuyou, you asked us to search for "The Book of Mountains and Rivers."

417
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:50,100
It means that you still remember Lady Yun and Minister Qin's behest.

418
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,800
How about we use this chance...

419
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,200
- to pull down the crown prince?
- Wuyu.

420
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,400
I have my own plans.

421
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,800
This is not something that should be spoken aloud.

422
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,400
Yes, Wuyou.

423
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,600
Master Xin, did you find anything?

424
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:10,000
I found this just now when I searched the manor.

425
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,600
This is weird.

426
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,800
Why would they have a Western Qi tool in this manor?

427
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,200
- Western Qi?
- Western Qi?

428
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,000
That's right.

429
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,400
Although this climbing hook is not something rare,

430
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,800
the way it was tied is very special.

431
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,600
You know that the weather is very rough in Western Qi, right?

432
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,000
It's very windy and sandy over there.

433
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,600
So, in order to prevent the rope from tearing,

434
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,400
they will use a complicated way to tie their hook.

435
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,400
And every once in a while, they'll retie it again...

436
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,400
to make sure that it's sturdy.

437
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,200
So, the people who sneaked into the manor that day...

438
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,600
are people from Western Qi.

439
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:53,092
Your Highness, there is a lady outside asking for you.

440
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,900
She said that she is the mistress of Moon Embrace Teahouse.

441
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,600
Have a drink, Your Highness.

442
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,800
This is indeed a good tea.

443
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,000
You love tea.

444
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,800
So when I got this new tea, I thought of you immediately.

445
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,000
That's why I brought it to you.

446
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,600
People who love tea will know what's best to be eaten with the tea.

447
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,000
This box of red dates has a subtle sweetness to them.

448
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,200
It's best to be eaten with the tea.

449
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,900
Have a taste.

450
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,800
Thank you, Your Highness.

451
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,200
How is it?

452
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:19,600
The fragrance of dates with the fragrance of tea. Sweet with a bite.

453
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,200
They are an excellent match.

454
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,800
If you like it,

455
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,600
I'll ask them to give one to you, only you.

456
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:46,300
Looks like you really like this place.

457
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,900
Maybe it's the grass or the trees.

458
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:52,100
I have a sense of familiarity with this place.

459
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:55,400
This manor is occupied by Yu Shihai and his son for so long.

460
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,900
It's such a waste.

461
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:01,400
No wonder Leng Yan said that you were caught by Yu Wenjie...

462
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,800
the last time because you were wandering around.

463
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,800
I'm sorry that I had troubled you.

464
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,800
I planned to bring you here for a tour...

465
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,800
after everything was settled at first.

466
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,200
I never thought that you'd lose your patience come by yourself.

467
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,100
You don't welcome me?

468
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:19,000
If you like it, I can show you around.

469
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,600
But... it's better if you don't wander alone.

470
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,600
There are many contraptions here.

471
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,300
If you trigger them accidentally, you might get hurt.

472
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,400
With you here, I can't possibly wander around myself.

473
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,200
Please show the way.

474
00:35:40,657 --> 00:35:43,622
Before this, I heard that this fort was very deep...

475
00:35:43,623 --> 00:35:45,547
and the buildings were very complicated.

476
00:35:45,547 --> 00:35:49,304
Today, it looks like... if this place was without those contraptions,

477
00:35:49,304 --> 00:35:54,182
it would be a gorgeous and breathtaking place.

478
00:35:54,182 --> 00:35:57,799
When I gave you Man Yin Chamber, it didn't seem like you enjoyed it.

479
00:35:57,799 --> 00:36:01,064
But you are so interested in this manor.

480
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:05,086
The threshold of your manor is very high.

481
00:36:05,086 --> 00:36:08,188
Everything in the manor belongs to you.

482
00:36:08,188 --> 00:36:10,579
Others can't touch it without permission.

483
00:36:10,579 --> 00:36:13,096
You gave me a chamber without any reasons.

484
00:36:13,096 --> 00:36:14,879
How could I accept it?

485
00:36:14,879 --> 00:36:17,976
No matter how high the threshold is, it's not set for you.

486
00:36:17,977 --> 00:36:21,235
As long as you are willing, I can give the whole manor to you.

487
00:36:21,236 --> 00:36:22,896
How about that?

488
00:36:26,357 --> 00:36:30,292
If other people were to hear this, they'd misunderstand.

489
00:36:30,292 --> 00:36:31,727
You are a noble.

490
00:36:31,727 --> 00:36:33,986
It's already bad enough that you're associated with me.

491
00:36:33,987 --> 00:36:35,524
We have known each other for so long.

492
00:36:35,525 --> 00:36:40,253
Have I ever cared about your name, background, status, or rank?

493
00:36:40,253 --> 00:36:43,536
At first, I thought that you didn't care for all of these as well.

494
00:36:45,204 --> 00:36:48,088
Nobody can truly be oblivious about them.

495
00:36:48,088 --> 00:36:50,882
No matter what you think,

496
00:36:50,882 --> 00:36:53,978
it'll still be impossible for us.

497
00:36:57,790 --> 00:37:00,270
Then, why did you come to me?

498
00:37:01,659 --> 00:37:05,310
Is it really because of the scenery in this manor?

499
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:09,147
Or do you have other intentions?

500
00:37:35,289 --> 00:37:37,345
What are you doing?

501
00:37:37,346 --> 00:37:40,926
Don't you think that this is a very familiar scene?

502
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:44,620
I don't understand what you mean.

503
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:47,000
If you don't like me here,

504
00:37:47,001 --> 00:37:49,401
then I just won't come again.

505
00:38:00,832 --> 00:38:04,193
Nothing is definite in this world.

506
00:38:04,193 --> 00:38:08,483
A status or a standing... is a matter of personal choice.

507
00:38:08,483 --> 00:38:10,181
The things that are important to you today...

508
00:38:10,181 --> 00:38:13,855
might become a thorn in your heart in another day.

509
00:38:13,856 --> 00:38:15,861
The things that you deemed impossible...

510
00:38:15,861 --> 00:38:19,222
might become possible in the near future.

511
00:38:20,651 --> 00:38:24,211
When my teacher, Qin Yong, built this place in the beginning,

512
00:38:24,212 --> 00:38:27,457
he never thought that his people-based transformation would fail.

513
00:38:27,458 --> 00:38:30,543
When Yu Shihai transformed this manor with glee,

514
00:38:30,543 --> 00:38:34,578
he never thought that the Yu family would one day be destroyed.

515
00:38:37,454 --> 00:38:41,294
Man Yao, things are always changing.

516
00:38:41,294 --> 00:38:46,052
A little fire can burn this manor into nothingness.

517
00:38:46,052 --> 00:38:47,959
People are forgetful.

518
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,776
No matter how glorious a family is for generations,

519
00:38:49,777 --> 00:38:52,313
people can forget about it completely.

520
00:38:52,313 --> 00:38:56,173
Those that need to be forgotten will be forgotten.

521
00:38:56,173 --> 00:38:57,974
So,

522
00:38:59,006 --> 00:39:02,200
if there's something in front of me that I want,

523
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,062
I'll do my best to grasp it in my hands.

524
00:39:05,062 --> 00:39:08,596
Nothing can stop me.

525
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:13,425
♫ The snow falls on my palm ♫

526
00:39:13,426 --> 00:39:18,931
♫ I just want to gaze at you one more time ♫

527
00:39:18,931 --> 00:39:26,555
♫ I wait for the warmth of your gaze to melt it ♫

528
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:32,014
Your Highness, it's raining.

529
00:39:32,014 --> 00:39:36,056
♫ I miss you but I can only gaze at you in silence ♫

530
00:39:36,057 --> 00:39:38,604
♫ You are keeping me out with your care ♫

531
00:39:38,605 --> 00:39:44,890
♫ Although we are together, I feel lost ♫

532
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:48,899
Looks like the sky wants to keep you here.

533
00:39:48,899 --> 00:39:52,123
Even God is helping me.

534
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:03,549
This place used to be a library built by my teacher.

535
00:40:03,549 --> 00:40:05,928
It was my favorite place.

536
00:40:05,928 --> 00:40:09,018
When I was young, I could stay here for the whole afternoon.

537
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:13,591
Now that I can stand here again with you today,

538
00:40:13,591 --> 00:40:16,346
it's like the peaceful time from back then...

539
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:18,629
has come back to me again.

540
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:24,468
What is it?

541
00:40:24,468 --> 00:40:26,266
Nothing.

542
00:40:27,874 --> 00:40:32,876
♫ In a blink of an eye, my hair has turned silver ♫

543
00:40:32,877 --> 00:40:36,455
♫ I'm fated to live in loneliness without any regrets ♫

544
00:40:36,456 --> 00:40:39,562
That's right. Hug her.

545
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:42,303
Wuyou is indeed very capable.

546
00:40:46,605 --> 00:40:51,581
♫ I'm willing to wipe away your blood and wounds for you ♫

547
00:40:51,581 --> 00:40:55,671
♫ I'm willing to live in darkness for you ♫

548
00:40:55,672 --> 00:40:58,547
♫ As long as I can be with you ♫

549
00:40:58,547 --> 00:41:00,782
♫ I don't mind... ♫

550
00:41:00,782 --> 00:41:04,062
Your Highness. I should go back.

551
00:41:04,062 --> 00:41:08,856
♫ ...hiding in the dark ♫

552
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:14,180
Why did she leave? How can you let her leave at a time like this?

553
00:41:21,382 --> 00:41:24,999
Just now, you shouldn't have let her leave.

554
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,672
With my swaggering experiences,

555
00:41:27,673 --> 00:41:30,039
both of you care for each other.

556
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:34,078
I think you might be able to capture her heart and her kiss very soon.

557
00:41:34,078 --> 00:41:38,085
I can achieve my goal without having to do that.

558
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:42,326
Wuyou, you have really fallen in love with her, right?

559
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,207
- Look how shy you are.
- Shut up.

560
00:41:46,207 --> 00:41:49,742
If you don't like to hear it, then I won't speak of it.

561
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:53,720
Stop looking. She has already left.

562
00:42:10,413 --> 00:42:12,273
Yali.

563
00:42:12,273 --> 00:42:15,496
Your mind has been wandering as of late.

564
00:42:15,496 --> 00:42:18,155
I'm very worried about you.

565
00:42:19,759 --> 00:42:21,499
Yali!

566
00:42:22,292 --> 00:42:23,660
Father.

567
00:42:23,661 --> 00:42:25,900
What is it, Father?

568
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:29,798
You have been stuck in this manor for too long.

569
00:42:29,799 --> 00:42:33,946
You even refused to go out with Prince Li.

570
00:42:33,946 --> 00:42:37,113
I'm sorry that I had made you worry.

571
00:42:37,113 --> 00:42:39,068
But you are not well.

572
00:42:39,069 --> 00:42:42,283
I wish to accompany you to the house.

573
00:42:42,284 --> 00:42:45,416
I didn't mean to blame you.

574
00:42:45,416 --> 00:42:50,569
If you want to be filial to me, go to Chengxi for me tomorrow.

575
00:42:50,569 --> 00:42:54,031
What is it that you need that is so urgent?

576
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:02,630
♫ I've been secretly missing you for several seasons already ♫

577
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:08,510
♫ Who was the first to talk about love? ♫

578
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:15,050
♫ I'm still trying to be nice to myself ♫

579
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:22,080
♫ Just allow me to get you back to this date ♫

580
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:28,890
♫ The western wind dyes the flowering season
in thick gray color ♫

581
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:34,810
♫ And I am still standing here waiting for the rain to come ♫

582
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:41,930
♫ No matter how good or bad the season turns out ♫

583
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:48,510
♫ I will still try with my utmost to make a home for us ♫

584
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:58,930
♫ In just one day, I've tasted the entire human world's warmth ♫

585
00:43:58,930 --> 00:44:05,660
♫ Yet, you are always the one I'm longing for ♫

586
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:11,800
♫ Even with thousands of feelings, we'll have no regrets ♫

587
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:19,410
♫ Look at this love, because of you I have a sweet aftertaste ♫

588
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:35,650
♫ In just one day, I've tasted the entire human world's warmth ♫

589
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:42,280
♫ Yet, you are always the one I'm longing for ♫

590
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:48,440
♫ Even with thousands of feelings, we'll have no regrets ♫

591
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:55,720
♫ Look at this love, because of you I have a sweet aftertaste ♫

592
00:44:55,720 --> 00:45:06,020
♫ Nothing will... go away ♫
