56

All these sins.

Back then,

59

because of my wild ambition to rebuild the country,

60
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:33,280
I had played with others' feelings.

61

And the price I have to pay...

62
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:41,120
is to see both of you brothers destroying each other.

85

searched the whole palace for her... but you couldn't find her.

86
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,760
It means that...

87
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,380
she is dead.

88
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,580
Wuyou, we have searched the whole palace from the inside out.

89
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,260
And we couldn't find Consort Rong Le.

90
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,700
But Xiao Sha is still looking for her.

91

Wait for me.

97
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,419
Stop right there. You...

98
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:09,180
Why are you still alive?

99
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:12,600
How is it possible that my Qi'er is dead?

100
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,440
Although he had contacted the Destined Poison

101
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,720
for the past 20 years and more,

102
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,540
I had carefully used the most valuable medicine to prolong his life.

103
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:29,940
You must be... the reason behind his death.

104
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,620
Brother Qi is dead?

105
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,440
Brother Qi.

106
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,360
Why are you still here?

107
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:45,960
Are you... afraid that your mother will suspect you?

108
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:51,560
Are you afraid that your mother... will stop Ke'er from getting rid of the poison inside me?

109
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:55,880
You have already given your blood and life to me.

110
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:02,200
Now, you even use your dead body to protect me.

111
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,120
No.

112
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:08,220
That is impossible. That is impossible.

113
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,180
Brother Qi.

114
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,280
I'm sorry.

115
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,080
I shouldn't have forgotten about you.

116
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,580
How could I have forgotten about you?

117
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:23,999
Then, why don't you... die together with him?

118
00:17:23,999 --> 00:17:27,780
You are not worthy of all the things that Qi had done for you.

119
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,160
You...

120
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,680
should have already been dead when you contacted the Scorpion Toxin.

121
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:54,799
If Qi had not saved you by putting the medicine...

122
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:57,139
in your snacks to protect your heart,

123
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:00,860
you wouldn't have gotten off with just white hair.

124
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,800
But in order to save you,

125
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,660
do you know what punishment he received?

126
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:08,520
You are unworthy of being a mother.

127
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,420
The things that I did...

128
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,680
were nothing.

129
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:22,340
The physical pain Qi'er felt is nothing...

130
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:25,339
compared to the heartache he felt when he knew that...

131
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:28,340
you had fallen in love with Zongzheng Wuyou.

132
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,759
In order to save you,

133
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:34,180
he gave you to others with his own hands.

134
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,760
He had to put his pride in his pocket...

135
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:40,020
and he had to put up with your hatred towards him.

136
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,800
No.

137
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,880
It's all because of you.

138
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:55,140
Fu Yuan, my father had indeed hurt you before.

139
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,220
But my mother had forgiven you.

140
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,940
Wuchou had respected and taken care of you.

141
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,300
Man Yao had helped you before.

142
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:09,899
And the people from several countries... had protected and served you.

143
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,900
But because of your own hatred,

144
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,400
you have hurt so many people.

145
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:20,519
And you almost... incited war between us few countries.

146
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:24,079
Reprisal breeds reprisal. But the people are innocent.

147
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:27,240
When you willingly let yourself be swallowed up by hatred,

148
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,180
- you should have expected this ending.
- Everything that all of you did...

149
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,880
is fake and insincere!

150
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,620
I have nothing now.

151
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,000
Everything that you see can be fabricated.

152
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,900
So, you have to believe in your heart.

153
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,700
I'm the one who wishes for your happiness the most in this world.

154
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,720
What I can promise you now is, your child will be fine.

155
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,919
Your child will be safe. I won't lie to you.

156
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,620
I promise to neutralize your poison for sure, Man'er.

157
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,640
I just hope that you can trust me for one last time.

158
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:11,130
Man'er, since I won't be able to bring you happiness,

159
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:16,120
I should just... give you my blessings.

160
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:25,200
Man'er, don't forgive me.

161
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,380
Continue to hate me like this.

162
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,580
Because, when the people you hate leave you,

163
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,840
you won't be too sad about it.

164
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,740
[Here lies Zongzheng Wuchou and Qin Xiang]

165
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,919
Wuchou,

166
00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:29,340
Mother had taught me this song.

167
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,860
I hope that you'll like it.

168
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:35,350
Whenever she thought about her other lost child,

169

Man Yao is still not willing to leave Western Qi?

Consort Rong Le is not willing to talk much.

174
00:23:03,459 --> 00:23:07,519
She just sits in the tearoom alone and wanders around the Cold Harem.

175
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,760
If that's the case, no need to disturb her anymore.

176
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,320
All of us are not able to blot out our past...

and the deep hatred that is engraved in our hearts.

A few years ago, I might have forced her to come with me at all costs.

But time has changed.

180

Sooner or later, we will understand that...

181
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:42,779
putting down things that we are persistent on is leniency towards ourselves.

Greetings, Your Highness.

185
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:02,479
When His Majesty was still alive, he wrote this letter...

186
00:24:02,479 --> 00:24:06,440
and instructed me to give it to you and only you.

187

thank you for taking care of my brother all these years.

217

If His Majesty could hear us from the underworld,

218
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:58,240
he would definitely hear your grief.

219
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,040
I still feel guilty after all these years.

220
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:05,159
When you and His Majesty were in Chen, His Majesty had insisted to take you away...

221
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:08,900
because he had found the other half of the medical book of Lone Frost Sage.

222

If I had chosen to believe in him back then,

because... it's about the choice you make with your destiny.

Somebody... will sacrifice their own lives for others.

Brother Qi is that somebody.

230

Since birth, he knew that life was short.

231

That's why he could sympathize and forgive...

I'm guessing that it's in your right hand.

327
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,400
- I got it right.
- How did you know?

328
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,000
I...

329
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,000
How dare you cheat.

330
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,200
I don't care. We have to do it again.

331
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,400
- You already promised to marry me.
- What are you doing?

332
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,800
- You promised to marry me!
- Let go of me!

333
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,400
Let go of me, Wuyu.

334
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,400
All of you are so shameless. No.

335
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,600
We have to do it again. Let go!

336
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,400
No, I'm not going to let go!

[School of Wisdom]

338
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,400
The class starts now.

339
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,800
We are going to talk about "The Book of Mountains and Rivers" today.

340
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,300
Back then, Prince Li and his consort were brought together by this book.

341
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:35,100
The world thought that the book contained brilliant military schemes.

342
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,000
And those who had it, would rule the world.

343
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,100
So, many countries had their eyes on it.

344
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,200
But those who are buried by the lust for power didn't know that...

345
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,600
more than 10 years have passed since.

346
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,700
The mountains and the rivers have changed...

347
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:51,000
and more so for the people and things that live in it.

348
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,000
In this world, there is no monotonous art of war.

349
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,620
[The Book of Mountains and Rivers]

350
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,300
Aunt Luo Yan,

351
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:05,600
what about this Book of Mountains and Rivers that you gave us then?

352
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:13,800
There is nothing... in our Book of Mountains and Rivers.

353
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,200
Ying'er. Nian'er.

354
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:21,300
Do you know what was written inside the book that everybody was fighting for?

355
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,600
Do you know?

356
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,800
I don't know.

357
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,200
- How about you?
- I don't know as well.

358
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,800
That book contained some drawings of mountains and rivers...

359
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:33,300
as well as some boring poems written during one's free time.

360
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,400
Father. Mother.

361
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,800
Don't be rude.

362
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,900
Uncle. Aunty.

363
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,500
It was a drawing book used by my father...

364
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,800
to teach me and my sister back then.

365
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,900
It was called "The Book of Mountains and Rivers"

366
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:57,800
because he wanted us to have aspirations as lofty as the mountains and rivers.

367
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,400
After that, somebody had spread a false rumor about it...

368
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,500
until there was a huge issue because of it.

369
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:05,400
The strategy used by my late teacher, Qin Yong, to strengthen the country...

370
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,700
was by being generous to the people...

371
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,200
and with the whole world in his mind.

372
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,600
He used his courage, knowledge, and wisdom alone...

373
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:15,300
to take care of the peopleand to protect the world.

374
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:20,900
So, the blank Book of Mountains and Rivers is for you to fill up...

375
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:25,300
with new aspirations and bold visions when you grow up.

376
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,200
Study well. Don't be naughty.

377
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,700
Let's go now. Let's not disturb the children anymore.

379
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,400

The Zhou kingdom has its age,

How unlucky we are...

391
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,400
to be straddled in a chaotic world...

392
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,600
and to be strapped in others' plots.

395

to be able to lay down the foundation for a peaceful world...

♫ There are greed and jealousy
and people's hearts are unpredictable ♫

398
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,800
Actually, there is no absolute destiny.

399
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:34,500
One's destiny... is up to one's self after all.

400
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,000
Some were utterly helpless.

401
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,800
Some betrayed themselves.

402
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,200
Some had lost their way to darkness.

403
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:53,200
Naturally, there were some who came back to their senses completely.

404
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,600
Some who sought and explored.

405
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,800
And some who sacrificed themselves for others.

406
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,600
I just hope that from now on,

407
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,200
I can be with you until we are old and gray...

409
