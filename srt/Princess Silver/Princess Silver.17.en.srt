00:01:30,109 --> 00:01:33,029
[Episode 17]

2
00:01:37,878 --> 00:01:42,185
All I ever did was to look at you from a distance.

3
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:45,694
Every month, I will sew one of these fragrance pouches.

4
00:01:45,694 --> 00:01:50,199
I could only hide my thoughts inside these needleworks.

5
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,520
- Miss Sun.
- Please, hear me out.

6
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,750
I am afraid if I don't speak now,

7
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,282
I will never muster the courage again.

8
00:02:00,127 --> 00:02:02,811
As long as you are willing to accept me,

9
00:02:02,811 --> 00:02:05,806
I won't go to the south.

10
00:02:05,806 --> 00:02:11,040
From now on, wherever you go, I shall follow.

11
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:16,167
I appreciate your caring, but... I am a married man.

12
00:02:16,167 --> 00:02:18,788
I can't promise you anything.

13
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,025
My father wants to trade me for the glory of our family.

14
00:02:26,025 --> 00:02:28,765
But I don't care about that.

15
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:32,293
I can be your second wife,

16
00:02:32,294 --> 00:02:33,988
your servant,

17
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,137
as long as I can be with you,

18
00:02:38,137 --> 00:02:41,232
I am willing to do anything.

19
00:02:41,232 --> 00:02:43,319
Miss Sun, you have a bright future ahead of you.

20
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:47,055
What you are asking now... is meaningless.

21
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,694
General Fu!

22
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,911
Miss Sun.

23
00:02:54,911 --> 00:02:59,741
Your kindness... is more than I deserve.

24
00:02:59,741 --> 00:03:02,569
I will forget about what happened today.

25
00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:04,919
I hope you do the same.

26
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,533
General Fu, please stay!

27
00:03:10,127 --> 00:03:12,119
Please, don't go.

28
00:03:23,085 --> 00:03:24,580
Goodbye.

29
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,998
We bid Your Majesty farewell.

30
00:03:48,711 --> 00:03:50,535
At ease.

31
00:03:53,252 --> 00:03:55,011
Take your seats.

32
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,751
Father, your chair is terrible.

33
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,439
There is not even a cushion on it.

34
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,668
We are in the Royal Study, this is simply unsightly.

35
00:04:17,669 --> 00:04:20,389
Brother still has the wounds from all those beatings.

36
00:04:22,502 --> 00:04:25,535
- Bring me the golden silk cushion.
- Yes.

37
00:04:25,536 --> 00:04:27,452
Never mind.

38
00:04:27,452 --> 00:04:30,658
Wuyou, no matter how much you hate me,

39
00:04:30,658 --> 00:04:34,276
you must still take care of yourself.

40
00:04:34,276 --> 00:04:36,251
Thank you for your concern.

41
00:04:36,252 --> 00:04:38,691
My wounds have almost healed.

42
00:04:38,691 --> 00:04:41,376
But speaking of Your Majesty, there are many things to do.

43
00:04:41,377 --> 00:04:45,339
You being well is what's best for our country.

44
00:04:48,461 --> 00:04:50,280
Your Highness.

45
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:03,360
You... should get everything settled in the south.

46
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,812
After it's done, come back here and help me out.

47
00:05:06,812 --> 00:05:11,300
Otherwise, I'll have to spend nights in this study.

48
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,159
Father, if you said you spent all your time in the harem,

49
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,920
Wuyou would never come back to help you.

50
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,087
Nonsense.

51
00:05:19,087 --> 00:05:21,877
Father, you are the ruler of this country.

52
00:05:21,878 --> 00:05:23,319
You can't be so temperamental.

53
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:26,556
Even if you toss this scroll at me, you still need to sign it.

54
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,576
Wuyou.

55
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,804
I understand, because of Fuyuan's wrong doings,

56
00:05:42,805 --> 00:05:44,907
you have hated me for years.

57
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:48,577
I will not justify my actions.

58
00:05:48,577 --> 00:05:51,398
I let your mother down.

59
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:54,262
Back in the day,

60
00:05:55,377 --> 00:05:57,418
I focused on strengthening this nation.

61
00:05:57,419 --> 00:05:59,830
I had a great vision.

62
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:02,667
I thought that giving up on love for a moment...

63
00:06:02,667 --> 00:06:05,407
would allow me a chance to make up for it later on.

64
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,831
But in the end...

65
00:06:08,831 --> 00:06:13,439
Right! Wuyou also said that you are no longer a young man,

66
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,084
but you still put in so much effort to save our necks.

67
00:06:16,085 --> 00:06:18,443
Now that we are leaving you,

68
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:21,960
we feel sorry for not being able to repay you as your sons.

69
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,543
Father, take care of yourself and live well.

70
00:06:24,544 --> 00:06:26,759
Enough of your nonsense.

71
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,052
That is not what your brother would say.

72
00:06:29,052 --> 00:06:31,219
Speaking of you,

73
00:06:31,219 --> 00:06:33,399
stop making me any more trouble.

74
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,126
Learn to grow up.

75
00:06:35,127 --> 00:06:38,189
That is how I can live long and well.

76
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:41,919
I am sorry for interrupting,

77
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,268
but His Majesty did all he could because of Prince Li's case.

78
00:06:45,269 --> 00:06:46,919
His Majesty ordered the Supreme Court...

79
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,592
to catch the real culprit that caused the commotion...

80
00:06:49,593 --> 00:06:51,780
so you may be proved innocent.

81
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,239
You knew I was wronged all along?

82
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,898
Why did you choose to send us to the south then?

83
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,520
It's good if you spend some time clearing your mind.

84
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:13,100
I... sacrificed my love.

85
00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:14,609
I spent my whole life for war...

86
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:19,003
to build the nation that we have today.

87
00:07:19,003 --> 00:07:23,284
I do hold some guilt for you, but I have no regret.

88
00:07:23,284 --> 00:07:26,552
I am willing to leave the people...

89
00:07:26,553 --> 00:07:29,922
in the capable hands of someone capable.

90
00:07:31,335 --> 00:07:35,875
Only then can I... face your mother in the afterlife.

91
00:07:39,252 --> 00:07:41,959
- General Fu.
- Please inform His Majesty that...

92
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,710
I am here with my wife to thank him for granting this marriage.

93
00:07:45,711 --> 00:07:47,411
A moment, please.

94
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,168
See? It's that shameless woman.

95
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,500
Prince Li gave up on her, she disguised herself to crawl into his bed!

96
00:07:56,586 --> 00:07:59,155
What a shameless woman. And now she has married General Fu.

97
00:07:59,156 --> 00:08:01,239
- You are right.
- If it wasn't for her,

98
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,717
Prince Li wouldn't have been exiled to Qingzhou.

99
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:07,202
Just ignore what the people say.

100
00:08:07,202 --> 00:08:09,544
You only need to listen to me.

101
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,430
[It's to no avail being together without harmony]

102
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,134
Congratulations on your wedding.

103
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:31,023
Husband and wife, such an envious sight.

104
00:08:31,023 --> 00:08:32,799
Thank you, Your Highness.

105
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,679
I heard you are leaving.

106
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:40,802
I wish both of you a safe journey.

107
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,117
Greetings, Prince Chen.

108
00:08:45,117 --> 00:08:47,309
Greetings, Prince Li.

109
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:52,023
Wuyu, let's go.

110
00:08:52,023 --> 00:08:54,209
Sir Sun. Miss Yali.

111
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:55,668
We are leaving for Qingzhou.

112
00:08:55,669 --> 00:09:00,043
Let's say your goodbyes to General Fu and his wife.

113
00:09:00,043 --> 00:09:03,274
Congratulations on your wedding.

114
00:09:03,275 --> 00:09:05,359
Congratulations to you too, Sir Sun.

115
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,877
Once we arrived in Qingzhou,

116
00:09:06,878 --> 00:09:11,011
it will be time to set everything in place for Wuyou's wedding.

117
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:14,611
Prince Chen, this is not a joke.

118
00:09:18,043 --> 00:09:20,411
Congratulations to Prince Li.

119
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,565
And for you too, Miss Sun.

120
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,293
General, His Majesty is a little unwell.

121
00:09:29,294 --> 00:09:31,376
You and your wife may leave now.

122
00:09:31,377 --> 00:09:33,570
There is no need to express your gratitude again.

123
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,969
Thank you, Sir.

124
00:09:39,102 --> 00:09:40,682
Let's go.

125
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,920
Look! Isn't this the sedan of General Fu?

126
00:09:54,921 --> 00:09:57,248
I heard the General married a shameless woman.

127
00:09:57,249 --> 00:09:59,839
Right! Why would he marry such a lady?

128
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,359
Shameless!

129
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,599
Stop spreading rumors or you will be arrested.

130
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,159
Stop it, stand aside!

131
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,500
- Evil woman! Eat this!
- Stop throwing rocks!

132
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,991
Do not be bothered by these people.

133
00:10:12,992 --> 00:10:16,042
Since you married me...

134
00:10:16,042 --> 00:10:18,344
They are just kids.

135
00:10:18,344 --> 00:10:20,319
I don't mind them at all.

136
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,310
[Moon Embrace Teahouse]

137
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,350
[Moon Embrace Teahouse]

138
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,720
Why didn't you go to the Tranquil Garden?

139
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,538
I have other matters to see to.

140
00:11:04,586 --> 00:11:06,942
I have some questions for you.

141
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,919
What questions do you have for me?

142
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,959
I will tell you everything I can if I have the answers.

143
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,029
Why did you make him leave?

144
00:11:18,029 --> 00:11:20,543
Something as risky as causing a mess in the city...

145
00:11:20,544 --> 00:11:22,501
is not what he would do.

146
00:11:22,502 --> 00:11:24,562
Was that your doing?

147
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,245
His Majesty refused to meet us.

148
00:11:29,246 --> 00:11:31,001
Perhaps he already knows.

149
00:11:31,002 --> 00:11:34,662
You are accusing me without any proof?

150
00:11:34,662 --> 00:11:36,995
Sometimes I feel like...

151
00:11:36,995 --> 00:11:41,302
you share quite a lot of similarities with our emperor.

152
00:11:41,302 --> 00:11:45,579
No matter what crime Prince Li commits, how many people he hurts,

153
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:47,903
all you ever care about is him.

154
00:11:47,903 --> 00:11:51,822
You never... had any trust in me.

155
00:11:54,043 --> 00:11:56,140
Rong Le.

156
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:59,932
You need to understand that I am your husband.

157
00:11:59,932 --> 00:12:02,009
If it wasn't your doing,

158
00:12:02,009 --> 00:12:04,126
why did you keep it a secret from me?

159
00:12:04,127 --> 00:12:07,127
Why wouldn't I keep it from you?

160
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:09,251
An outsider's life and death...

161
00:12:09,252 --> 00:12:12,161
have nothing to do with any of us.

162
00:12:13,252 --> 00:12:17,219
Do you honestly think I will tell you the truth...

163
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:22,200
and watch as my own wife gets worried because of a mere outsider...

164
00:12:22,252 --> 00:12:23,725
and feel guilty for it?

165
00:12:25,605 --> 00:12:28,419
His life has nothing to do with me.

166
00:12:28,419 --> 00:12:30,449
However...

167
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:32,962
Whatever way you choose to question me,

168
00:12:32,963 --> 00:12:34,965
I'll take it as...

169
00:12:34,965 --> 00:12:39,201
a start for building trust between the two of us.

170
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,339
From now on, if there is any secret you wish to know,

171
00:12:42,339 --> 00:12:44,314
you can come to me.

172
00:12:44,314 --> 00:12:47,905
I will tell you all you want. Don't draw your own conclusions.

173
00:12:47,905 --> 00:12:51,738
Of course, I do wish for a day...

174
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:54,002
when you can put your trust in me.

175
00:12:54,002 --> 00:12:55,723
I don't need to.

176
00:12:58,581 --> 00:13:02,739
Rong Le, sooner or later, you will realize that...

177
00:13:02,739 --> 00:13:05,372
I am the one that truly cares for you.

178
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,200
Yali, now that you are leaving for Qingzhou,

179
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:23,926
I don't even have a friend I can talk to.

180
00:13:25,752 --> 00:13:27,160
Yali.

181
00:13:27,811 --> 00:13:29,427
Yali?

182
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,399
I am sorry, Your Majesty.

183
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,239
When I realized that I was leaving you,

184
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,239
I have felt sad and thus a little absent-minded.

185
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,980
I hope Your Majesty is not offended by my behavior.

186
00:13:42,043 --> 00:13:44,999
Yali, you have both beauty and intelligence.

187
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,839
It would be great if you were my daughter.

188
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,661
What a shame.

189
00:13:49,661 --> 00:13:53,168
If Your Majesty wants me to stay, then I won't leave for Qingzhou.

190
00:13:53,169 --> 00:13:57,126
I shall join you and carry out my duty as your daughter.

191
00:13:57,126 --> 00:13:58,751
Yali.

192
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,900
Your Majesty.

193
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:04,800
Yali, this is more than I can decide for myself.

194
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,839
You are your father's only daughter.

195
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:11,200
If I were to keep you here, how would I explain it to him?

196
00:14:11,235 --> 00:14:13,879
We have no other relatives in Qingzhou.

197
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,734
My father has his servants.

198
00:14:15,735 --> 00:14:18,444
Your Majesty, please let me stay.

199
00:14:18,444 --> 00:14:22,679
Yali, when did you learn to be so stubborn?

200
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:26,126
His Majesty sent you and your father to aid Prince Li.

201
00:14:26,127 --> 00:14:29,079
Wuyou may have lost his status,

202
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,959
but we can see from His Majesty's decision...

203
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,720
that he plans to let Wuyou return later on.

204
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,639
Yali, when your mother passed away,

205
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:43,302
she mentioned so many times about finding you a good husband.

206
00:14:43,302 --> 00:14:45,390
Your Majesty, I don't want to get married.

207
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:47,200
I just want to be with you.

208
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,519
Nonsense.

209
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,399
I put so much effort into guiding you and caring for you.

210
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,519
Do you think I did so to make you my servant?

211
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,120
Your Majesty.

212
00:14:56,121 --> 00:14:59,331
I have no child to care for me.

213
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:02,768
The Crown Prince is unreliable.

214
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:04,980
Wuyou is far more benevolent than he is.

215
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,918
Seeing that you and Wuyou are childhood friends,

216
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:10,479
if you do become his consort one day,

217
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,251
or even become the empress like me,

218
00:15:13,252 --> 00:15:15,319
I can rely on you.

219
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,643
After His Majesty passes on,

220
00:15:18,643 --> 00:15:21,954
I will still have you to look after me.

221
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:25,745
If you still remember my kindness to you,

222
00:15:25,745 --> 00:15:28,720
please do what is right.

223
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,360
The world is like a game of chess.

224
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,450
Everything changes so easily.

225
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:45,872
Love and hatred,

226
00:15:45,872 --> 00:15:48,381
complicated and convoluted.

227
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:51,611
I thought I was the master of this game.

228
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,609
But I must ask myself...

229
00:15:58,233 --> 00:16:00,683
if I had become...

230
00:16:00,683 --> 00:16:03,791
a mere pawn in the hand of destiny.

231
00:16:14,502 --> 00:16:16,482
Brother Wuyou.

232
00:16:16,482 --> 00:16:18,959
Stop thinking about that vile woman.

233
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,719
She lied to you with cruelty.

234
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,544
I thought I got myself a good sister.

235
00:16:24,545 --> 00:16:27,120
But she fooled me, too.

236
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,200
Enough.

237
00:16:31,252 --> 00:16:33,042
Brother Wuyou.

238
00:16:33,043 --> 00:16:37,379
After you arrive in Qingzhou, remember to look after yourself.

239
00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:39,418
As for that fool Wuyu,

240
00:16:39,419 --> 00:16:41,959
stop him from going to the public house again.

241
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,039
Take care of yourself, too.

242
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,358
If anyone picks on you, let me know in a letter.

243
00:16:50,206 --> 00:16:52,566
- Leng Yan.
- Yes.

244
00:16:54,627 --> 00:16:56,779
Seal this place.

245
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:02,390
Yes, Your Highness.

246
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,330
You may all leave now.

247
00:17:42,943 --> 00:17:45,703
Zhao Yun, I need to tell you something.

248
00:17:45,704 --> 00:17:49,293
If you were here, why didn't you come in to cheer up Brother Wuyou?

249
00:17:49,294 --> 00:17:50,710
I...

250
00:17:50,711 --> 00:17:54,519
I am leaving too, why aren't you cheering me up?

251
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,334
Don't go away! Don't go!

252
00:17:58,335 --> 00:18:00,855
Don't go! I have something to tell you.

253
00:18:00,855 --> 00:18:02,960
I really need to tell you something.

254
00:18:04,878 --> 00:18:10,295
Actually, I'm a little upset about leaving you here.

255
00:18:10,295 --> 00:18:12,701
When I thought about leaving you,

256
00:18:12,701 --> 00:18:14,444
it pains my heart.

257
00:18:14,444 --> 00:18:17,092
What's wrong with you? Are you sick?

258
00:18:17,092 --> 00:18:18,881
Don't interrupt me.

259
00:18:18,882 --> 00:18:20,839
We grew up together as kids.

260
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,260
You know me well enough.

261
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,885
Since I was a kid, there are tons of girls that had a crush on me.

262
00:18:27,885 --> 00:18:31,959
But this is the first time I am talking so seriously to a girl.

263
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,420
What are you trying to say?

264
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,231
Well...

265
00:18:38,544 --> 00:18:40,463
Do you have a crush on me?

266
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,399
I knew it all along.

267
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,168
But I never had the courage to tell you.

268
00:18:45,169 --> 00:18:47,287
I like you, too.

269
00:18:47,287 --> 00:18:50,900
I once thought I would have a long time to enjoy this life.

270
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,319
I thought there was still plenty of time...

271
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,032
to wait for you to grow up.

272
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:59,252
But I never expected to leave you so soon.

273
00:18:59,252 --> 00:19:02,197
Who knows when I will come back here?

274
00:19:02,197 --> 00:19:04,042
Curse you fool! You stinking Wuyu!

275
00:19:04,043 --> 00:19:06,159
You always pretended like you didn't care about me!

276
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,600
You followed me like a fly and talked about marrying my brother!

277
00:19:09,639 --> 00:19:12,386
It hurts! Stop it!

278
00:19:13,836 --> 00:19:16,839
After that speech, if you are not touched at all,

279
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,320
at least give me an answer.

280
00:19:21,335 --> 00:19:22,792
I...

281
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,239
Did I misunderstand her?

282
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,230
She doesn't have a crush on me?

283
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:30,492
No way!

284
00:19:30,492 --> 00:19:32,084
No.

285
00:19:32,085 --> 00:19:34,042
With my charm as Prince Chen,

286
00:19:34,043 --> 00:19:37,146
if she doesn't like me, I will make that happen.

287
00:19:40,752 --> 00:19:43,063
Are you still mad at me?

288
00:19:43,063 --> 00:19:44,543
- Take this.
- What...

289
00:19:44,544 --> 00:19:45,985
What is this?

290
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:47,993
It's you.

291
00:19:47,993 --> 00:19:52,168
- Me?
- Princess Rong Le and I made this together.

292
00:19:52,168 --> 00:19:54,561
It's a little ugly.

293
00:19:55,878 --> 00:19:59,161
Keep it if you like it. If you don't like it,

294
00:19:59,161 --> 00:20:01,438
give it to me.

295
00:20:01,438 --> 00:20:05,000
I like it! I like it a lot.

296
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,905
You accepted my present. You have to listen to me now.

297
00:20:07,905 --> 00:20:10,719
Focus on helping Brother Wuyou while you are in Qingzhou.

298
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,079
I want a letter from you every day.

299
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,879
Stay at least three feet away from other women.

300
00:20:14,879 --> 00:20:16,820
But this is too much for me.

301
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:20,299
- Can I take back what I said just now?
- Not a chance.

302
00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:22,800
If you won't listen, I am not waiting for you.

303
00:20:22,801 --> 00:20:27,489
There are many handsome boys in this city after all.

304
00:20:27,489 --> 00:20:30,594
Fine, I'll listen to you.

305
00:20:30,594 --> 00:20:32,485
Promise me.

306
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,000
Moon Embrace is reopening.

307
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,119
We can have tea again.

308
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,976
We can finally have some decent tea.

309
00:20:56,977 --> 00:21:00,071
What tea do they have this time?

310
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,540
[Moon Embrace Teahouse]

311
00:21:12,736 --> 00:21:14,532
Let's go inside.

312
00:21:19,813 --> 00:21:21,400
Princess.

313
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,740
You are here.

314
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,354
Stop calling me "Princess."

315
00:21:25,354 --> 00:21:27,679
Just address me like you used to.

316
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:32,419
Chen Yu, are you reopening the teahouse?

317
00:21:32,419 --> 00:21:33,777
Yes, Mistress.

318
00:21:33,777 --> 00:21:36,199
This teahouse is like a house for us.

319
00:21:36,199 --> 00:21:38,260
None of us could bear to leave it.

320
00:21:39,627 --> 00:21:41,184
Rong Le.

321
00:21:43,377 --> 00:21:47,135
I know you love the art of tea-making.

322
00:21:47,135 --> 00:21:50,318
I ordered my men to lift the seal off this teahouse.

323
00:21:50,318 --> 00:21:54,279
From now on, you are still the owner of this premise.

324
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:58,194
I am not the same as those ordinary men.

325
00:21:58,194 --> 00:22:00,933
I won't keep you inside the manor.

326
00:22:00,933 --> 00:22:05,739
If there is anything you wish to do or love, you may do as you please.

327
00:22:05,739 --> 00:22:07,756
I will give you my support.

328
00:22:09,711 --> 00:22:12,351
Very well, I must be on my way now.

329
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,055
Miss.

330
00:22:23,902 --> 00:22:28,859
Pick up the spirit. If you want, we can run this teahouse together.

331
00:22:28,859 --> 00:22:31,357
Let's do this for Long Yue.

332
00:22:31,357 --> 00:22:33,639
If you choose otherwise, you may leave.

333
00:22:33,639 --> 00:22:36,420
The rest of us will take care of this place.

334
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,804
You are always welcomed here.

335
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:46,586
Chen Yu, are you really willing to give up on traveling and learning...

336
00:22:46,586 --> 00:22:49,901
the art of the lute just for our teahouse and for me?

337
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:53,639
Miss, do not see this as I giving up on my dreams.

338
00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:57,140
Take it as I can't let this mortal coil go.

339
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:02,330
For us, this teahouse is the beginning and the end.

340
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:06,697
If I want to improve my skills in music, this is the right place to be.

341
00:23:09,502 --> 00:23:10,912
Good.

342
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:34,494
Everyone in this world has a different view of love.

343
00:23:34,494 --> 00:23:36,485
Some will give it their all.

344
00:23:36,485 --> 00:23:38,703
Some will use it for their gain.

345
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,717
Whether you wish to be repaid...

346
00:23:42,717 --> 00:23:45,197
you must follow your heart.

347
00:23:59,486 --> 00:24:01,960
How dare you come here!

348
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,238
Long Yue is dead because of you.

349
00:24:04,238 --> 00:24:07,490
You left her with no choice but death!

350
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:09,573
Your crocodile's tears...

351
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:12,089
will only bother the deceased.

352
00:24:12,089 --> 00:24:14,970
Your Highness has her own reasons.

353
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:17,572
I have mine as well.

354
00:24:17,572 --> 00:24:20,807
I have nothing but an apology for you.

355
00:24:20,807 --> 00:24:23,714
It doesn't matter how you see me.

356
00:24:23,714 --> 00:24:26,752
I will carry out my duty.

357
00:24:26,752 --> 00:24:29,917
My duty... is to protect you.

358
00:24:29,917 --> 00:24:31,897
You are a hypocrite.

359
00:24:43,277 --> 00:24:45,363
Your false concerns are not needed here.

360
00:24:45,363 --> 00:24:46,879
I am protecting the princess.

361
00:24:46,879 --> 00:24:48,687
Her safety comes first.

362
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:51,439
I bet this is another of the emperor's orders.

363
00:25:03,943 --> 00:25:06,790
You know I won't hurt you, why must you do this?

364
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:09,512
Let go of me!

365
00:25:12,027 --> 00:25:14,867
Back off, I don't need your help.

366
00:25:23,486 --> 00:25:25,390
You lying ingrate!

367
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,219
How dare you come back here.

368
00:25:27,219 --> 00:25:31,318
Are you going to spy on her and sell her out to the emperor?

369
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,818
I tried to kill you just now.

370
00:25:34,818 --> 00:25:36,274
Go ahead and tell His Majesty.

371
00:25:36,274 --> 00:25:38,615
Let him have me killed.

372
00:25:39,943 --> 00:25:45,274
And Long Yue, she was so loyal to the princess.

373
00:25:46,486 --> 00:25:51,119
Listen closely. Her blood is on your hands.

374
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:53,234
I hate myself for not knowing any martial arts.

375
00:25:53,234 --> 00:25:57,893
Otherwise, I would kill you so you can't hurt another soul again!

376
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:07,293
As for you, you must obey Captain Xiao.

377
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,251
If not, you won't even know how you get killed.

378
00:26:12,251 --> 00:26:14,520
Whether you believe me or not,

379
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,446
I am the only one who can keep her safe now.

380
00:26:17,446 --> 00:26:20,160
I promised you I would bring you back to Western Qi.

381
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,360
You have my words.

382
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,121
Why would the princess believe you?

383
00:26:25,402 --> 00:26:29,916
If you still have some conscience left in you, please leave.

384
00:26:29,916 --> 00:26:31,694
The further, the better!

385
00:26:31,694 --> 00:26:33,634
Ling Yue.

386
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:35,826
Stop arguing with someone that means nothing.

387
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:38,818
I am not feeling well. Bring me some water.

388
00:26:38,818 --> 00:26:41,106
Come, let's get some water.

389
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:48,320
[Lin Entrance]

390
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,510
Farewell, Prince Li and Prince Chen.

391
00:26:52,083 --> 00:26:54,728
- Sir Sun.
- Thank you, Sir Yang.

392
00:26:54,728 --> 00:26:56,401
We have been exiled per our punishment.

393
00:26:56,401 --> 00:26:59,323
I heard you did well in making sure we get it.

394
00:26:59,323 --> 00:27:01,568
All the other officers are afraid of us.

395
00:27:01,568 --> 00:27:03,439
But you came to see us off alone.

396
00:27:03,439 --> 00:27:05,759
Why? Do you feel bad for us?

397
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:07,968
That is not true, Your Highness.

398
00:27:07,968 --> 00:27:09,707
I made the proposal because of duty,

399
00:27:09,707 --> 00:27:11,939
but coming here is a personal matter.

400
00:27:11,939 --> 00:27:14,319
I know what is right and wrong.

401
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:17,825
This old scholar is actually quite interesting.

402
00:27:18,986 --> 00:27:20,819
I remember this is the place...

403
00:27:20,819 --> 00:27:22,959
where my brother refused to welcome the princess.

404
00:27:22,959 --> 00:27:27,059
You were so worried about etiquette.

405
00:27:34,261 --> 00:27:37,039
Sir Yang, the wind here is strong. You should go home.

406
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,755
You may go now. Go on.

407
00:27:42,819 --> 00:27:44,699
Your Highness.

408
00:27:44,699 --> 00:27:47,599
Sir Yang is a loyal officer of the Imperial Court.

409
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:50,901
It's an honor to leave the national affairs in his hands.

410
00:27:50,901 --> 00:27:53,041
You have my word, Your Highness.

411
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:57,638
Your Highness, have a safe journey.

412
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,799
Father, will we ever come back here?

413
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:10,720
If His Highness is back, we will return with all the glory.

414
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,960
Miss Sun, we need to go now.

415
00:28:33,235 --> 00:28:34,887
Ling Yue.

416
00:28:36,277 --> 00:28:39,736
General Fu, how may I help you?

417
00:28:42,652 --> 00:28:43,999
What is this?

418
00:28:43,999 --> 00:28:46,551
Dried longan soup for Her Highness.

419
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:50,275
- Send it to her.
- Yes.

420
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:58,715
Ling Yue, you have spent a lot of time with the princess.

421
00:28:58,715 --> 00:29:01,841
Do you know if she has any hobbies?

422
00:29:01,841 --> 00:29:04,013
Hobby?

423
00:29:04,013 --> 00:29:06,268
Nothing in particular.

424
00:29:07,451 --> 00:29:09,793
Please, try to recall.

425
00:29:09,793 --> 00:29:14,194
I simply wish to know my wife better.

426
00:29:14,194 --> 00:29:17,890
I can cheer her up a little. What do you think?

427
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:23,058
The princess usually likes brewing and drinking tea.

428
00:29:23,058 --> 00:29:25,358
She also likes playing chess and calligraphy.

429
00:29:25,358 --> 00:29:29,068
Right! She loves to listen to Miss Chen Yu's music.

430
00:29:29,068 --> 00:29:32,939
The princess smiles whenever she listens to her music.

431
00:29:35,859 --> 00:29:38,798
Good. Thank you, Miss Ling Yue.

432
00:29:38,798 --> 00:29:42,877
If you recall anything else, be sure to tell me anytime.

433
00:29:42,877 --> 00:29:44,126
Yes.

434
00:29:44,126 --> 00:29:47,598
Thank you. Very well, get back to your work.

435
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:55,597
General Fu actually cares a lot for the princess.

436
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:33,800
The song you play is not as full of sorrow as when we first met.

437
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:38,449
While it is tranquil, it has a sense of uniqueness in it.

438
00:31:38,449 --> 00:31:41,548
Perhaps your thoughts are different now.

439
00:31:47,569 --> 00:31:51,583
That is because you are here with me.

440
00:31:54,919 --> 00:31:56,943
Right.

441
00:31:56,943 --> 00:32:00,560
I learned this song especially for you.

442
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:04,506
If you like it, I can play it for you every day.

443
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:06,337
Your kindness is much appreciated.

444
00:32:06,337 --> 00:32:10,084
Judging by your tone, are you not feeling well?

445
00:32:10,084 --> 00:32:13,633
I am fine. I took my medicine.

446
00:32:13,633 --> 00:32:16,116
I must get some rest now.

447
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:29,139
Rong Le, I will find a way to cheer you up.

448
00:32:31,819 --> 00:32:33,543
Greetings, My Lady.

449
00:32:33,543 --> 00:32:34,957
Who sent this?

450
00:32:34,957 --> 00:32:37,909
Lady Xiang, this is from General Fu.

451
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,552
Open it up.

452
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,100
You can leave now.

453
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,620
Yes.

454
00:33:13,778 --> 00:33:15,875
What is this all about?

455
00:33:20,194 --> 00:33:21,994
Your Highness.

456
00:33:21,994 --> 00:33:23,239
His Highness has great affection for me.

457
00:33:23,239 --> 00:33:24,865
It's my birthday tomorrow.

458
00:33:24,865 --> 00:33:29,710
His Highness invited many gentlemen and ladies of noble families to the Eastern Palace.

459
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:32,548
I never thought they would send so many presents.

460
00:33:32,548 --> 00:33:36,819
I have no idea where to keep all of these.

461
00:33:36,819 --> 00:33:39,194
He is holding a feast for you in the Eastern Palace?

462
00:33:39,194 --> 00:33:43,200
Indeed. You were not told about this?

463
00:33:44,085 --> 00:33:46,550
I was too busy preparing for the feast.

464
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:49,401
I forgot to inform you.

465
00:33:49,401 --> 00:33:53,039
I hope you are not offended. I am a mere commoner.

466
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:56,984
I was hoping you can be the host for the feast.

467
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:01,960
Why am I even needed in this place?

468
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:06,121
Even a mere courtesan is getting more attention than me.

469
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,318
Your Highness, don't cross the line.

470
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:16,279
What do you want?

471
00:34:16,279 --> 00:34:18,651
Let go of me! Let go!

472
00:34:18,651 --> 00:34:21,639
Guards! Take this insolent woman out of here!

473
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:24,632
Guards!

474
00:34:24,632 --> 00:34:26,815
Let go of me.

475
00:34:28,694 --> 00:34:30,190
You...

476
00:34:30,862 --> 00:34:32,735
- Xiang.
- Your Highness.

477
00:34:32,735 --> 00:34:35,000
How could you break the present from General Fu?

478
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,778
What? You!

479
00:34:39,819 --> 00:34:41,639
Get out!

480
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:46,984
How could you hold a feast for a mere courtesan in the palace?

481
00:34:46,984 --> 00:34:48,560
If His Majesty knows about this...

482
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,984
His Majesty? Don't you dare bring up his name.

483
00:34:51,984 --> 00:34:54,359
Zongzheng Wuyou has been exiled and stripped of all ranks.

484
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:56,699
My father asked for me to assist him.

485
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:59,179
The throne will be mine sooner or later.

486
00:34:59,179 --> 00:35:00,899
Nothing can stand in my way.

487
00:35:00,899 --> 00:35:02,711
While you are enjoying your success,

488
00:35:02,711 --> 00:35:05,420
the others have their eyes on the Eastern Palace.

489
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:08,291
Your Highness cannot be too arrogant.

490
00:35:08,291 --> 00:35:13,077
My Lady, maybe you should think about yourself.

491
00:35:13,077 --> 00:35:15,510
Your father lost his authority.

492
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:17,959
He has no power.

493
00:35:17,959 --> 00:35:20,459
If you dare lecture me with that tone,

494
00:35:20,459 --> 00:35:22,719
I will make sure to get rid of you.

495
00:35:24,778 --> 00:35:27,562
Xiang is always so generous.

496
00:35:27,562 --> 00:35:29,884
She can replace you sooner or later.

497
00:35:32,062 --> 00:35:34,668
Stop standing there.

498
00:35:34,668 --> 00:35:37,550
Get out of here. I don't want to see you.

499
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:39,862
Scram.

500
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,413
Xiang, were you hurt?

501
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:50,901
Just ignore her.

502
00:35:50,901 --> 00:35:53,835
Tomorrow, you will become the lady of the house.

503
00:35:53,835 --> 00:35:57,736
You will see to those guests for me.

504
00:35:57,736 --> 00:36:00,549
Thank you for defending me.

505
00:36:18,569 --> 00:36:19,800
Miss Ling Yue.

506
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,520
Why are you here?

507
00:36:21,529 --> 00:36:24,194
This is the medicine for Princess. It just arrived.

508
00:36:24,194 --> 00:36:26,774
Make sure to prepare this for Her Highness on time.

509
00:36:28,294 --> 00:36:31,086
I know both of you hate me.

510
00:36:31,086 --> 00:36:33,282
I have no means to explain everything.

511
00:36:33,282 --> 00:36:34,859
You can hate me all you want.

512
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:38,462
But please don't hurt yourself because of this.

513
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:03,331
Mother!

514
00:37:06,611 --> 00:37:08,372
Princess.

515
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:13,537
Princess, you are finally awake.

516
00:37:13,537 --> 00:37:16,292
I was so worried for the past few days.

517
00:37:20,611 --> 00:37:23,488
Your Highness, it's time for your medicine.

518
00:37:27,783 --> 00:37:30,526
I am all right. I don't need this medicine.

519
00:37:30,526 --> 00:37:33,443
Princess, you have been too busy recently,

520
00:37:33,443 --> 00:37:36,510
you passed out because you didn't take the medicine.

521
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:40,079
If His Majesty hadn't sent this here to remind me,

522
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:42,219
you would still be in a coma.

523
00:37:42,219 --> 00:37:43,898
He sent this?

524
00:37:43,898 --> 00:37:46,061
Yes, just the same as before.

525
00:37:46,061 --> 00:37:48,503
His Majesty orders his men to send this here every month...

526
00:37:48,503 --> 00:37:50,999
to make sure you are well.

527
00:37:50,999 --> 00:37:54,839
I don't know why he forced you to marry General Fu,

528
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:58,074
but His Majesty has always cared for you.

529
00:37:58,074 --> 00:38:00,741
How is this medicine sent here?

530
00:38:00,741 --> 00:38:02,485
Captain Xiao gave this to me.

531
00:38:02,485 --> 00:38:06,377
He said he got it from His Majesty's men.

532
00:38:08,708 --> 00:38:10,419
Is this the original prescription?

533
00:38:10,419 --> 00:38:14,559
I didn't check, I simply boiled it as ordered.

534
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:16,239
Are there any of the herbs left?

535
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:18,399
We used up all of it this month.

536
00:38:18,399 --> 00:38:20,468
There are still some remains left in the pot.

537
00:38:20,468 --> 00:38:22,408
Bring them to me.

538
00:38:22,408 --> 00:38:25,799
One more thing. Get rid of this. I am not drinking it.

539
00:38:25,799 --> 00:38:27,340
But Your Highness, you are ill.

540
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:30,568
I don't even know why I am ill, how can I take this medicine?

541
00:38:30,568 --> 00:38:35,087
Your Highness, you mean something is off with this medicine?

542
00:38:35,087 --> 00:38:37,016
I may not a skilled healer,

543
00:38:37,016 --> 00:38:41,819
but at least I know that almost all headaches are spontaneous.

544
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:45,387
I haven't heard of a remedy that must be taken every month.

545
00:38:45,387 --> 00:38:48,678
I am not sure if I take this medicine for the headache...

546
00:38:48,678 --> 00:38:50,859
or if the medicine is the cause of it.

547
00:38:50,859 --> 00:38:53,685
Your Highness, you mean this is not a remedy?

548
00:38:53,685 --> 00:38:56,219
It's some sort of poison that gives you a headache?

549
00:38:56,219 --> 00:39:00,691
I started to have flashes of memories after I stop taking the medicine.

550
00:39:00,691 --> 00:39:05,793
If I stop taking it for good, maybe my amnesia and headache will be cured.

551
00:39:05,793 --> 00:39:09,739
Sure, I will collect the remains right away and have a closer look.

552
00:39:09,739 --> 00:39:12,679
Also, keep this a secret from Xiao Sha.

553
00:39:12,679 --> 00:39:16,240
The next time you get the medicine, don't boil it. Bring it to me.

554
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:29,000
How may I help you, General Fu?

555
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,151
These are the tea leaves I got from a merchant.

556
00:39:33,151 --> 00:39:34,777
I can see you are getting well.

557
00:39:34,777 --> 00:39:37,878
So, I am letting this master of tea review these teas.

558
00:39:37,878 --> 00:39:41,517
If there is something you like, the teahouse can get a supply of it.

559
00:39:41,517 --> 00:39:43,360
Much appreciated.

560
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,158
Give them a try.

561
00:39:49,277 --> 00:39:52,255
I can tell you really love this job.

562
00:39:53,694 --> 00:39:55,459
I am glad you do.

563
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:58,700
This really isn't all that hard for me.

564
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,552
You have my thanks.

565
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:04,729
General Fu.

566
00:40:08,692 --> 00:40:10,587
What do you need?

567
00:40:15,444 --> 00:40:18,072
Lady Rong Le is not an outsider. Speak.

568
00:40:18,072 --> 00:40:20,694
An invitation from His Highness. It's his new wife, Lady Xiang.

569
00:40:20,694 --> 00:40:23,987
General and Lady Rong Le are invited to his feast.

570
00:40:24,819 --> 00:40:26,915
Lady Xiang?

571
00:40:30,652 --> 00:40:34,942
I am Hen Xiang, from the House of Fragrance.

572
00:40:34,942 --> 00:40:38,368
Don't you know Lady Rong Le has just gotten well?

573
00:40:38,368 --> 00:40:40,039
Tell them she is still ill.

574
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:42,129
- We'll pay a visit some other time.
- Yes.

575
00:40:42,129 --> 00:40:44,067
Wait.

576
00:40:44,067 --> 00:40:45,918
I can go.

577
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,126
It's the birthday of His Highness' favorite consort,

578
00:40:50,126 --> 00:40:51,858
and we are both invited.

579
00:40:51,858 --> 00:40:53,883
We shouldn't turn down this invitation.

580
00:40:53,883 --> 00:40:57,120
I don't want this to bring you any trouble.

581
00:40:57,827 --> 00:41:00,912
Are you willing to meet the guests with me?

582
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:04,523
I don't want to be cooped up in here all day.

583
00:41:04,523 --> 00:41:08,652
Besides, I will carry out the promise I made.

584
00:41:08,652 --> 00:41:10,526
There is nothing to be worried about.

585
00:41:10,526 --> 00:41:12,701
I will make sure to do the same.

586
00:41:17,777 --> 00:41:19,443
I want to go out today.

587
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:22,390
Send these tea leaves to Moon Embrace.

588
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:25,974
I don't think it's convenient to leave on your own.

589
00:41:25,974 --> 00:41:27,799
What is that supposed to mean?

590
00:41:27,799 --> 00:41:30,539
Don't take this wrongly. What I meant was...

591
00:41:30,539 --> 00:41:33,814
it's not convenient for a patient to go out on her own.

592
00:41:33,814 --> 00:41:35,279
How about this?

593
00:41:35,279 --> 00:41:37,780
Let Xiao Sha go with you.

594
00:41:39,544 --> 00:41:40,694
Okay.

595
00:41:40,694 --> 00:41:42,615
Stay safe.

596
00:41:50,042 --> 00:41:51,561
Understood.

597
00:42:05,652 --> 00:42:07,152
Miss.

598
00:42:07,152 --> 00:42:10,940
Chen Yu, I have a task that concerns my very life for you.

599
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:13,285
Are you willing to help me out?

600
00:42:13,285 --> 00:42:17,799
I once swore to do anything I can to repay your kindness.

601
00:42:17,799 --> 00:42:19,940
I don't need you to repay me.

602
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:21,959
But after thinking about it back and forth,

603
00:42:21,959 --> 00:42:26,258
I feel like you are the only one I can trust and the best for this mission.

604
00:42:26,258 --> 00:42:28,259
I have Xiao Sha distracted.

605
00:42:28,259 --> 00:42:30,851
Only the two of us know about this.

606
00:42:30,851 --> 00:42:33,476
Whatever you need, Miss.

607
00:42:33,476 --> 00:42:35,800
Do you know any trustworthy doctors?

608
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,699
It's better if they are also great herbalists.

609
00:42:37,699 --> 00:42:40,179
I need you to find out if there is anything wrong...

610
00:42:40,179 --> 00:42:42,588
with these herbal remains.

611
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:51,160
♫ I've been secretly missing you for several seasons already ♫

612
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:56,710
♫ Who was the first to talk about love? ♫

616
